| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers on Thursday that they were preparing their agencies for the possibility of violence, both from unruly demonstrators and terrorists, at the upcoming Republican and Democratic nominating conventions. Speaking before the House Homeland Security Committee, Johnson said he was concerned that demonstrations at the events could get out of hand.In an interview with Reuters following his testimony, Johnson said he knew of no specific or credible threat to either convention but that it was important to be prepared.  Johnson said the Department of Homeland Security would be sending more than 3,000 personnel to each convention. 
Recent clashes between attendees and protesters at rallies for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump have led to physical assaults and arrests.The Republican National Convention being held July 18-21 in Cleveland and the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia from July 25-28 follow a string of high-profile shootings.
In June, an Islamic State sympathizer committed the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, killing 49 people in a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Last week, five police officers in Dallas were killed by a black man angry about police shootings of unarmed black men.Comey told the committee that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was monitoring the threat of violence at the conventions ""very, very carefully.""    
""Anytime there is a national spotlight on a political event in the United States, there is a risk that groups that aspire to do just that, engage in acts of domestic terrorism, will be attracted,"" Comey said.  (Reporting by Julia Edwards; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Thursday said she regrets making critical comments about Republican presidential contender Donald Trump.""On reflection, my recent remarks in response to press inquiries were ill-advised and I regret making them,"" she said in a statement issued by the court.Ginsburg, the 83-year-old senior liberal member of the high court, inserted herself into the U.S. presidential election in recent days by making negative remarks about Trump in a series of media interviews. Her earlier remarks prompted criticism from Trump, who said she should resign. In one of a series of Twitter posts, he also said Ginsburg's ""mind is shot.""The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Ginsburg's statement.
Legal ethics scholars also questioned Ginsburg's actions, saying Supreme Court justices should stay out the political fray in order to maintain their judicial integrity. The New York Times and the Washington Post chided Ginsburg in editorial articles.""Judges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office. In the future I will be more circumspect,"" Ginsburg said.In a CNN interview posted on Tuesday, Ginsburg called the presumptive Republican nominee ""a faker.""
In a separate interview with the New York Times, Ginsburg joked about moving to New Zealand if Trump wins the White House.Under a code of conduct that federal judges - but not Supreme Court justices - are required to follow, judges are forbidden from publicly endorsing or opposing candidates for public office. 
Supreme Court justices generally shy away from discussing politics or other divisive issues in public. Ginsburg is one of the more outspoken members of the court but had never before made such pointed remarks about a political candidate.The controversy erupted as Trump prepared for the opening of the July 18-21 Republican convention, which will formally make him the party's presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election.The Supreme Court has been ideologically split between four liberals and four conservatives since conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died in February.

By Melissa Fares

For the scores of photographers on the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign trail, capturing the characters, the color and the vibe of the election often means turning away from the speaker on the podium.""The audience, the voters and the candidate are equally important,"" said Brian Snyder, who has been a photographer for Reuters for more than 20 years. ""The voters need the candidates and the candidates need the voters. Any way you can show that visually is a good campaign picture as far as I'm concerned."" Take, for example, the window full of young Bernie Sanders supporters that Snyder photographed at Bronx Community College in New York, waving to the U.S. senator from Vermont. Sanders won enthusiastic support from young people in his hard-fought race against the eventual presumptive Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.Or look at the tree with umbrellas hanging to dry on it outside a rainy Sanders rally in Buffalo, New York, after the Secret Service prevented supporters from carrying them inside.""I'm sure one person did it, and then the other person thought it was a good idea, and then the next thing you know, there are 30 umbrellas,"" Snyder said. ""It was just one of those funny things.""
Veteran Reuters photographer Mike Segar described covering this year's U.S. presidential campaign as ""strangely fun."" In a 23-year Reuters career, Segar has covered five presidential elections, but said that this one was different, especially with New York businessman Donald Trump, who became the presumptive Republican nominee, playing a starring role.""The tone of the Trump campaign makes everything different for everybody,"" Segar said. He added that heightened security around Trump had also impacted how photographers illustrate the campaign.       
Segar took a photograph of one of his own meals when he was covering a Clinton rally: hamburger meat on a bed of undressed spinach in a tinfoil to-go container. ""I was trying to give viewers a little bit of a different taste of what we see on a day to day basis,"" Segar said with a laugh. ""Your photos don't necessarily have to capture the most earth-shattering moments of the campaign, but they have to capture people's interest.""
Reuters photographer Lucas Jackson said he always looked for a different angle at rallies.In one of his photos, young reporters can be seen staring into the screens of their Macbook laptops at a Sanders rally in Pennsylvania.""Usually cameras are pointed at the candidate,"" Jackson Said.""I'm always looking to add context.""

By Lisa Lambert
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio on Wednesday unveiled legislation to tax financial trades that will likely wither in Congress but could stoke partisan fires in the presidential election.The Oregon Democrat's bill would levy a 0.03 percent tax on most financial trades, and is intended to discourage ""risky trading behaviors."" DeFazio expects that will collect more than $417 billion in revenue in the next decade, which he said could be used to fund free higher education or infrastructure repairs.When the Democratic Party gathers in Philadelphia for its national convention at the end of the month, it will adopt a platform that calls for taxing trades. Many liberals in the party embrace the proposal as a way to curb speculative trading, which they say led to both the 2007-09 financial crisis and the 2010 stock market ""flash crash.""The party's left wing, led by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who ran against Hillary Clinton for the presidential nomination, meanwhile, has pushed for free university education.""Thanks to the reckless greed of Wall Street over the past few decades, the American economy is a grossly unbalanced playing field,"" said DeFazio.
""The only way we can level it is if we rein in reckless speculative financial trading and curb near-instantaneous high-volume trades that create instability in the stock market and our national economy.""The legislation is supported by Democratic Party stalwarts, including the AFL-CIO labor union federation, the Americans for Financial Reform coalition, the Communications Workers of America union, and advocacy group Public Citizen. The Center for Economic and Policy Research said it also backs the bill.It will likely not get far. Republicans control both chambers of Congress, and most say that Wall Street regulation passed in the aftermath of the financial crisis has been overly restrictive. In addition, the Republican Party generally favors having fewer taxes.
""I am opposed to any taxes that would raise the cost of financial transactions,"" said Randy Neugebauer, the Republican chairman of a House subcommittee on financial institutions, noting that the bill would tax stock, bond and derivatives trades. Currently, the top U.S. securities regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, charges a tax on security futures of less than half of a penny to recover the costs of regulating markets and financial professionals.
The idea for the tax can be traced back to economist John Maynard Keynes, who wrote in 1935 after another devastating financial crisis - the Great Depression - that a transfer tax on all transactions might mitigate speculation.(This version of the story corrects reference to Center for Economic and Policy Research in 7th paragraph, which had been incorrectly described as a Democratic stalwart) (Reporting by Lisa Lambert; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"

By Emily Stephenson

Republican Donald Trump will name Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate on Friday, U.S. news organizations reported on Thursday.Here are five facts about Pence, a Republican who previously served in the U.S. House of Representatives:LATECOMER ON TRUMP BANDWAGON
Pence did not initially support Trump.Shortly before Indiana's Republican primary election in May, Pence endorsed Trump's rival, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Pence praised Trump at the time, but he compared Cruz to former Republican President Ronald Reagan and called him a ""principled conservative.""Trump won the state anyway, and Cruz dropped out of the Republican race. Trump and Pence have since met to discuss the running mate position.WELL-CONNECTED WITH DONORS

Pence has strong ties to billionaire donors Charles and David Koch, including current and former staff members who have worked for them.After saying he was primarily self-funding his campaign during the Republican primaries, Trump has been holding fundraisers during the general election, with support from the Republican National Committee. The New York businessman comes to the money race at a considerable disadvantage, however, compared with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.A SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE
Pence sometimes describes himself as ""a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.""
Pence in 2015 signed a religious freedom law that critics said opened the door to anti-gay discrimination. When he was in Congress, he opposed repealing the military's ""Don't Ask Don't Tell"" policy on sexual orientation.He also has pushed restrictive abortion regulations and has pushed for Congress to defund Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit women's health provider that performs some abortions.CRITIC OF WALL STREET BAILOUT
He was a vocal opponent of the 2008 Wall Street bailout.
In September 2008, Pence, then a U.S. House member, argued against the $700 billion package to stabilize the U.S. financial system, saying it would ""nationalize almost every bad mortgage in America."" Pence also said the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation passed in 2010 would hurt jobs. Trump has vowed to dismantle Dodd-Frank, though he has not said how he would replace it.OPPOSITION TO SYRIAN REFUGEES
Pence opposed allowing Syrian refugees coming to the United States to settle in Indiana.In November 2015, the governor directed state agencies to suspend the resettlement of Syrians there. A family that was supposed to arrive in December was instead sent to Connecticut. A federal judge later ruled the order ""clearly discriminates"" against refugees from a particular country.However, Pence tweeted disapproval in 2015 for plans to ban Muslims from entering the United States, an idea Trump has advocated. Pence called it ""offensive and unconstitutional."" (Editing by Caren Bohan and Jonathan Oatis)"

By Lawrence Hurley and John Whitesides
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican Donald Trump thrust the U.S. Supreme Court into the presidential campaign debate on Wednesday, rallying conservatives with a call for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to resign after she lambasted him in a series of media interviews.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee led a chorus of outrage over the comments by Ginsburg, who described Trump as a ""faker"" and speculated about the possibility of moving to New Zealand if he won the White House.In a post-midnight counterattack on Twitter, Trump said the 83-year-old leader of the court's liberal wing had ""embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot - resign!""The furor gave Trump a cause to help galvanize conservatives divided over his unorthodox candidacy but concerned that the high court is too liberal, a mistrust fueled by recent rulings upholding racial preferences in university admissions and striking down tough abortion restrictions in Texas.In three recent interviews, Ginsburg questioned how Trump had gotten away with not turning over his tax returns and said she could not bear to think about the wealthy real estate developer winning the White House.In response, Trump said Ginsburg had politicized the Supreme Court with her comments and suggested she owed her fellow justices an apology.""I'm questioning her mental capacity,"" he told Fox News Channel on Wednesday. ""For her to have done that is an absolute disgrace to the Supreme Court.""   Other Republicans jumped to join the attack, saying Ginsburg had proven she could not be an impartial voice on the country's highest court.""For someone on the Supreme Court who is going to be calling balls and strikes in the future based upon whatever the next president or Congress does, that strikes me as inherently biased and out of the realm,"" Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on CNN on Tuesday.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called her comments ""totally inappropriate,"" while Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said Ginsburg's statements reflected poorly on her objectivity.The New York Times and Washington Post joined in the rebukes, with the Times asking her to uphold the court's tradition of silence in political campaigns and drop the ""punditry and name-calling.""
Ginsburg's comments could push some on the right who have reservations about Trump into his camp, said Jonathan Adler, a conservative professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law who is not a Trump supporter.""There are some (not me) who learn to like Trump based on the enemies he makes,"" he said in an email.The controversy erupted as Trump prepared for the opening of the July 18-21 Republican convention, which will formally make him the party's presidential nominee in the Nov. 8 election.Ginsburg is the senior liberal on the court, which has been ideologically split between four liberals and four conservatives since conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died in February.""This gives Trump the ability to attack not only Justice Ginsburg but ultimately the authority of the Supreme Court. That is a very bad situation,"" said Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota Law School who served as a lawyer in the White House under Republican President George W. Bush.
JUDICIAL CODE
U.S. Supreme Court justices are not required to follow the code of judicial conduct that applies to judges on lower federal courts. The code, set by the U.S. Judicial Conference, says judges should not ""make speeches for a political organization or candidate, or publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office.""Still, the justices typically try to stay out of the political fray.The court has a sometimes pivotal role as a judicial counterweight to the executive and legislative branches of government, deciding some of the most divisive social issues in American life. In recent years, major rulings legalized gay marriage nationwide and upheld Democratic President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul. In public remarks earlier this year, Chief Justice John Roberts stressed it was important for the justices not to be seen as political players, saying criticisms of partisanship, which he described as inaccurate, were damaging to the court's reputation.
""We don't work as Democrats or Republicans,"" he said.Ginsburg was not immediately available for comment on Trump's remarks and the other rebukes.The high court, whose nine justices are nominated by the U.S. president to lifetime appointments, had already been caught up in political controversy as the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate refused to take up Obama's nominee to replace Scalia, Merrick Garland.Republicans have said the next president should be allowed to nominate a replacement for Scalia. Trump has emphasized the importance of naming conservative justices to the court.The next president, potentially serving two four-year terms, could have the opportunity to appoint up to three new justices, not including Scalia's replacement. Ginsburg is the oldest of the justices. Justice Anthony Kennedy turns 80 on July 23, while Justice Stephen Breyer turns 78 in August.Some Democrats defended Ginsburg, with U.S. Senator Jon Tester of Montana saying ""she called him (Trump) for what she saw"" and Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota saying, ""I think she's the ultimate determiner of what's appropriate and what isn't.""But Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said, ""I don't think we're well served by Supreme Court justices openly expressing their political opinions.""Asked about Ginsburg's remarks, White House spokesman Josh Earnest responded with a joke referencing a nickname used widely on social media by Ginsburg's admirers.""She didn't earn the nickname 'the Notorious R.B.G.' for nothing,"" he said. The name was inspired by rapper Notorious B.I.G. (Additional reporting by Emily Stephenson, Doina Chiacu and Caren Bohan; Editing by Frances Kerry and Jonathan Oatis)"

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. State Department officials told members of Congress on Tuesday that legislation that would allow families of Sept. 11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia is opposed by important U.S. allies and posed a national security risk.But many members of a House of Representatives Judiciary Committee subcommittee expressed strong support at a hearing for the ""Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act,"" or JASTA, which the Senate passed in May by unanimous voice vote despite President Barack Obama's veto threat.The Saudis, who deny responsibility for the 2001 attacks, strongly oppose the legislation. Other governments have also raised objections. The Dutch parliament warned that JASTA would represent a breach of Dutch sovereignty. A member of the British parliament wrote a column opposing it.Anne Patterson, the State Department's assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs, and Brian Egan, its legal counsel, testified that the measure could lead to lawsuits against the United States and discourage security cooperation such as intelligence sharing between governments.
""We cannot win the fight against ISIL without full international cooperation,"" Patterson said, using an acronym for the Islamic State militant group.But the bill's supporters say it would provide justice to those who lost loved ones in the attacks 15 years ago. They argue that if Saudi Arabia was not responsible for the attacks, it would win any lawsuits.
Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat who represents New York City, said worry about retaliation should not keep the measure from becoming law. ""That is no reason to deny justice to the victims of 9/11 and their families,"" he said.If it became law, JASTA would remove sovereign immunity preventing lawsuits against governments for countries found to be involved in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. It would allow survivors of the attacks, and relatives of those killed in the attacks, to seek damages from other countries.
In this case, it would allow lawsuits to proceed in federal court in New York as lawyers try to prove that the Saudis were involved in the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.There was no immediate word on when the House might vote on JASTA. The House was due to adjourn later on Thursday for its summer recess and will not return to Washington until September. (Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)"

By Noah Barkin
| BERLIN

BERLIN Britain's Nigel Farage will be at the Republican convention in Cleveland next week to dole out lessons from his Brexit campaign. So will Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch Freedom Party, who sees Donald Trump as an ally in his crusade to prevent an ""Islamization"" of the West.But some mainstream European conservatives who have traveled to previous Republican gatherings admit in private to being horrified at the prospect of a Trump presidency and are boycotting this year's spectacle, which runs from July 18-21.Many of the center-right politicians making the trip from Europe admit to secretly rooting for Trump's Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. They are going not to support Trump, they say, but to witness ""the Donald"" in the flesh and experience what is shaping up to be one of the rowdiest, most unpredictable Republican conventions in decades.""We will see whether Trump can reinvent himself at the convention,"" Guenter Krings, a senior lawmaker from German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives who will make the trip with just one other Bundestag colleague, told Reuters. ""One can only hope so, but I have my doubts.""Politicians from around the world are invited every four years to attend the Republican and Democratic conventions as part of a formal visitors program that includes briefings with campaign managers, pollsters and foreign policy experts. They also spend time in the main convention hall.This year, nearly 120 politicians from center-right parties outside the United States are expected, roughly half of them from Europe. Trump's candidacy has presented European parties with traditional links to U.S. Republicans with a dilemma. Many view his positions -- on issues like immigration, security, trade and the divisive Brexit question -- as closer to those of upstart far-right parties whose rise they are struggling to contain.EPP BOYCOTT
Four years ago, when Mitt Romney was the Republican candidate, the center-right European People's Party (EPP), the largest grouping in the European Parliament, sent a delegation of eight members to Tampa.
This year there will be no EPP delegation because no-one from the group expressed an interest in attending.Despite the wariness, there is a reluctance to criticize the famously thin-skinned Trump too openly, in part out of fear he could win the election in November and punish his foreign critics, as he threatened to do when David Cameron, the recently departed British prime minister, slammed Trump's proposal for a temporary U.S. ban on Muslims as ""divisive, stupid and wrong"".While the conservative mainstream is leery, Europe's array of nationalist, anti-immigration parties seem fascinated by Trump, even if some are uneasy about embracing the New York real estate businessman, who has vowed to ""make America great again"".A spokesman for Britain's UKIP party in Brussels confirmed that Farage would attend to ""give them some lessons"" on Brexit. And Wilders told Reuters that he would be in Cleveland and wanted to meet Trump there.""I hope Donald Trump becomes America's next president,"" Wilders said. ""Such a victory would be good for Europe. America and Europe are threatened by the same danger of cultural relativism and Islam.""
Austria's far-right Freedom Party, France's National Front and the Alternative for Germany (AfD) are not planning to send anyone to Cleveland, the parties said.""We are neutral,"" Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache told Reuters when asked if he supported Trump. ""He defends American interests. He is saying some things that need to be said.""Also absent will be Italy's Northern League, whose leader Matteo Salvini describes himself as an enthusiastic Trump fan but learned earlier this year that the admiration was not necessarily mutual.Salvini traveled to Pennsylvania in April to attend a Trump rally. He was photographed shaking hands with the Republican candidate and his party said Trump had endorsed Salvini to become Italian prime minister.But a month later, Trump denied in an interview ever having met Salvini and said he had no interest in doing so.
SHOCK AND HORROR 
Eirik Moen of the International Democrat Union, which coordinates trips to the convention by center-right politicians across the world, said that numbers could be dented this year because countries like Britain, Spain and Australia are in the midst of political transitions, making it difficult for some to travel.Still, eight British Conservatives who sit in the European Parliament are expected to be in Cleveland.On the continent, France's main center-right party, les Republicains, is not sending a delegation. And the contingent from Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) is unusually small.In Germany, political debate is conducted in a sober, reserved manner and personal attacks are rare, even during election campaigns. Hence the mix of shock and horror at the tone of the U.S. race.Trump has dismissed Merkel as ""insane"" for letting hundreds of thousands of refugees into the country. And his idea to build a wall along the Mexican border elicits shudders in Berlin, a city that was divided by its own wall for nearly three decades and will celebrate the 27th anniversary of its fall a day after U.S. voters cast their ballots on Nov. 8.""Many of Donald Trump's positions -- for example his stance toward Muslims, toward immigration from Mexico and gun ownership -- are simply not compatible with the positions of the conservatives and other parties in Germany,"" said Juergen Hardt, a CDU lawmaker who also acts as the government's coordinator for transatlantic relations.Hardt said he is planning to go on vacation with his family next week and won't be able to attend the convention.

WASHINGTON The U.S. presidential race is tied going into the major parties' national conventions and Democrat Hillary Clinton has been damaged by the FBI investigation into her email use while secretary of state, a new opinion poll showed on Thursday.The New York Times/CBS News poll showed 67 percent of voters surveyed said Clinton was not honest and trustworthy, up 5 percentage points from a CBS poll conducted last month before the FBI made its findings public.As Donald Trump prepares to accept the Republican presidential nomination next week, the poll showed him in a dead heat with Clinton in a general election matchup. Each candidate drew 40 percent of the vote, compared with the 6 percentage point lead enjoyed by Clinton in last month's survey, the poll showed.The margin of error was 3 percentage points in the CBS News/New York Times poll, which was conducted by telephone July 8-12 among a random sample of 1,600 adults nationwide, including 1,358 registered voters.  
The survey showed 62 percent of voters surveyed distrust Trump as well.""But Mrs. Clinton's shifting and inaccurate explanations of her email practices at the State Department appear to have resonated more deeply with the electorate,"" the Times wrote.
FBI Director James Comey said last week Clinton was ""extremely careless"" in the handling of classified information but the investigation found no evidence she or her colleagues intended to violate laws.The Times/CBS poll echoes the finding of a Quinnipiac Poll released on Wednesday that showed Trump pulling just ahead of Clinton in the so-called swing states of Florida and Pennsylvania as the former U.S. senator and first lady lost ground on honesty and moral standards.
In contrast to the New York Times/CBS News poll, a Reuters/Ipsos online opinion poll released on Tuesday showed Clinton leading Trump by 13 points at a national level, with 46 percent to Trump's 33 percent support among likely voters. The election is on Nov. 8. (Reporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Frances Kerry)"
