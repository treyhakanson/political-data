By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton leads Republican rival Donald Trump by 5 percentage points among likely voters, roughly the same advantage she has held over the past several weeks, according to the Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll released Friday.The Sept. 30-Oct. 6 opinion poll showed that 43 percent of likely voters supported Clinton while 38 percent supported Trump. Clinton has consistently led Trump by 4-6 points in every weekly poll since the beginning of September.During this period, the candidates faced off in the most-watched presidential debate in history - a matchup that a majority of Americans believed Clinton won. The New York Times also released portions of Trump's 1995 tax returns that showed the celebrity real estate developer had reported a loss that was big enough to have allowed him to avoid paying personal taxes for a number of years.Clinton and Trump will meet again in their second debate on Sunday night, which will be in a town hall format, with the Nov. 8 election fast approaching.At this point in 2012, the race was tighter between Democratic President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney: Obama led Romney by less than 2 percentage points among likely voters in the Reuters/Ipsos poll during the first week of October. The incumbent eventually won the 2012 election by nearly the same margin in the popular vote.
This year, however, both candidates appear to have a bigger opportunity to shake up the race and improve their numbers in the final weeks, given that a larger proportion of the electorate appears to be uncommitted. When asked in the poll, roughly one out of every five likely voters would not pick either major party candidate and instead selected options such as ""Other,"" ""Wouldn't Vote"" or ""Refused."" That was twice the number of uncommitted voters as there were in the Reuters/Ipsos poll at the same point in 2012.
Americans have expressed a dim view of both Clinton and Trump this year. Both candidates are disliked by a majority of likely voters, according to the poll, and an increasing number of women have expressed an ""unfavorable"" view of both candidates this week.In a separate poll that includes alternative-party candidates, Clinton led the field by 5 percentage points. Among likely voters, 42 percent supported Clinton, 37 percent supported Trump, 8 percent picked Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and 2 percent supported Jill Stein of the Green Party.The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English in all 50 states. The poll included 1,695 people who were considered likely voters due to their registration status, voting history and stated intention to vote in the election. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.
National opinion polls have differed this year in how they measure support for Clinton and Trump. Some polls, like Reuters/Ipsos, try to include only likely voters, while others include all registered voters. The Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll also gathers responses every day and reports results twice a week, so it often detects trends in sentiment before most other polls.An average of major opinion polls aggregated by RealClearPolitics showed Clinton ahead of Trump by 5 percentage points on Friday.

By Steve Holland and Michelle Conlin
| WASHINGTON/NEW YORK

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Leaders of religious conservative groups largely stood behind Donald Trump on Saturday, the day after vulgar sexual comments he made about women surfaced online, but some expressed concern that the U.S. Republican presidential nominee's remarks could depress evangelical turnout on Election Day.Most evangelical leaders did not condemn Trump, and instead pointed to an urgent need to prevent Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton from winning the presidency, reshaping the Supreme Court and implementing liberal policies.The latest blow to Trump's campaign came after a 2005 video surfaced of the then-reality TV star talking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. Vice presidential running mate Mike Pence said he could not defend Trump's words.Gary Bauer, chairman of the Campaign for Working Families, said Trump's ""grossly inappropriate language"" does not change the choice facing the country in the Nov. 8 election and that ""I continue to support the Trump-Pence ticket.""""Hillary Clinton is committed to enacting policies that will erode religious liberty, promote abortion, make our country less safe, and leave our borders unprotected,"" Bauer said.White evangelicals make up about 20 percent of the U.S. population, according to the Public Religion Research Institute, and represent a crucial voting bloc Trump needs to win the presidency.They have long represented a pillar of support for Republicans. In 2004, they were instrumental in President George W. Bush's re-election. They turned out in similar numbers in 2008 and 2012, when Mitt Romney, a Mormon who many evangelicals considered too moderate, was the Republican nominee, according to a report by the Pew Research Center.Support from evangelicals for Trump has been strong throughout his campaign, even though it was only late in life that the New York businessman adopted their cause. Social conservatives flocked to his side over other deeply religious Republican presidential candidates, such as Ted Cruz.
""Naturally I'm disappointed,"" said Steve Scheffler, head of the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition. ""But, you know, the Bible tells me that we are all sinners saved by grace and I don't think there's probably a person alive that I know of that hasn't made some mistakes in the past.""He said Clinton has peccadilloes of her own, most notably marital woes with her husband, former President Bill Clinton.""So yes, I will vote for Donald Trump. I'm not excusing his behavior at all. It's disgusting,"" he said.
DEPRESS TURNOUT 
Still, politically active Christian conservative leaders across the country said they were worried that Trump's comments could depress turnout among evangelicals.""Evangelicals are not going to vote for Hillary,"" said religious political activist David Lane. ""But this could cause them to stay home. This could be a big deal. Things like this matter.""Much will hinge on Trump's performance in the second presidential debate on Sunday night, and whether he can convince Christians that he is a changed man, Lane said.
""He already apologized and said he was wrong,"" said Lane. ""I think he's moving in the right direction. But he's got to do really well in the debate Sunday night.""Other religious leaders, however, were less forgiving.Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, tweeted an article detailing evangelical apathy toward the Trump tape, calling it a ""disgrace.""""What a scandal to the gospel of Jesus Christ and to the integrity of our witness,"" Moore wrote.Still, the majority view among religious conservatives appeared to be summed up by Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council action group, who said evangelicals ""are left with a choice of voting for the one who will do the least damage to our freedoms.""""This is far from an ideal situation, but it is the reality in which we find ourselves and as difficult as it is, I refuse to find sanctuary on the sidelines and allow the country and culture to deteriorate even further by continuing the policies of the last eight years,"" he said.

By Mark Hosenball, Dustin Volz and Jonathan Landay
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. government for the first time on Friday formally accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election.""We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,"" a U.S. government statement said on Friday about hacking of political groups.""These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.""U.S. intelligence officials concluded weeks ago that the Russian government was conducting or orchestrating cyber attacks against the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, possibly to disrupt or discredit the election, in which Democrat Hillary Clinton faces Republican Donald Trump.A Kremlin spokesman called the U.S. allegations ""nonsense"", the Interfax news agency reported. On Saturday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said the U.S. accusations lacked any proof and were an attempt by Washington to fan ""unprecedented anti-Russian hysteria"".""This whipping up of emotions regarding 'Russian hackers' is used in the U.S. election campaign, and the current U.S. administration, taking part in this fight, is not averse to using dirty tricks,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Saturday in comments posted on the ministry's website.The Obama administration's decision to blame Russia for the attacks is the latest downward turn in U.S. relations with Moscow, which are under strain over Russia's actions in Syria and Ukraine and in cyberspace.Also on Friday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Russian and Syrian actions in the Syrian civil war, including bombings of hospitals, ""beg for"" a war crimes investigation.In addition, a U.S. intelligence official said on Friday that Russia was moving short-range nuclear-capable missiles into Kaliningrad, a tiny Russian enclave between Poland and Lithuania, confirming Estonian news reports.
Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, said the public blaming for the hacks left one remaining question of ""why Donald Trump continues to make apologies for the Russians"". Trump had previously expressed doubt about Russia's involvement. In July, he suggested Russia should attempt to retrieve and publish emails from Clinton's private server. Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Hours after the U.S. government's accusation was levied, WikiLeaks posted hundreds of emails on its website purportedly hacked from Podesta's private account.CHANGE IN TONE

Until Friday, the Obama administration had avoided publicly singling out Russia in connection with the mounting civilian deaths in Syria or the cyber attacks.The statement by the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not blame the Russian government for hacking attempts against state election systems, but said ""scanning and probing"" of those systems originated in most cases from servers operated by a Russian company.However, a Department of Homeland Security spokesman said U.S. officials had concluded that the hacking attacks or probes of state voter registration systems were ""consistent with Russian motivations"".Concern has grown about the reliability of the U.S. voting system as a result of the breach, and Trump has called the system ""rigged,"" but without providing specific evidence.U.S. intelligence officials have said there is no evidence that voting recording systems have been manipulated. 
Identifying Russia as the actor behind the cyber attacks on political organizations falls short of more punitive measures the United States has taken against other countries for cyber intrusions.    Lawmakers of both political parties welcomed the formal accusation. Republican Senator Cory Gardner, chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific and International Cybersecurity, said he planned to introduce sanctions legislation.Earlier this year, a U.S. grand jury indicted seven Iranians employed by two Iran-based computer firms on charges of hacking into the U.S. financial sector. In 2015, Obama announced sanctions against North Korea for hacking into Sony Pictures.In 2014, the United States charged five Chinese military hackers for economic espionage aimed at U.S. nuclear, metals and solar industries.A senior U.S. official said the administration is considering other retaliatory steps against Russia, but he declined to identify them. Those steps may remain covert, the official said.  The Democratic National Committee publicly disclosed intrusions into its systems in June and held Russia responsible. Leaks of committee emails from pro-transparency group WikiLeaks soon followed, demonstrating what appeared to be favoritism for Clinton over another Democrat, Bernie Sanders, by committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Wasserman Schultz, a Florida congresswoman, stepped down.In Friday's statement, the government said disclosures of emails by WikiLeaks and hacking entities known as DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0 ""are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts"". WikiLeaks has not identified the source of its leaks and criticized those who have claimed it was Russia. Guccifer 2.0 has identified itself as a Romanian hacker, but U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks are both a front for Russian spy units.

WASHINGTON U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump issued a video statement early on Saturday in response to the disclosure of a 2005 videotape of him making lewd remarks about women.Here is a text of his statement:
""I've never said I'm a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I'm not. I've said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them. Anyone who knows me knows these words don't reflect who I am. I said it, I was wrong and I apologize. I've traveled the country talking about change for America but my travels have also changed me. I've spent time with grieving mothers who have lost their children, laid-off workers whose jobs have gone to other countries and people from all walks of life who just want a better future. I have gotten to know the great people of our country and I have been humbled by the faith they have placed in me. I pledge to be a better man tomorrow and will never, ever let you down. Let's be honest. We're living in the real world. This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we're facing today. We're losing our jobs. We're less safe than we were eight years ago and Washington is totally broken. Hillary  Clinton and her kind have run our country into the ground. I've said some foolish things but there's a big difference between the words and actions of other people. Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday.""

By Valerie Volcovici
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton struggled with how to secure the endorsement of labor unions while announcing her opposition to the Keystone XL oil pipeline, a project they supported but environmentalists opposed, according to leaked emails published by Wikileaks on Friday.Before announcing in September 2015 that she opposed TransCanada Corp's proposal to build a pipeline from Canada to the United States, her campaign sought to ""soften the blow"" to labor unions by offering an energy infrastructure plan that would create jobs, according to the emails. The internal campaign emails from August 2015 reveal the difficulty Clinton had in appeasing both unions and environmentalists as she fought for her party's nomination ahead of the Nov. 8 election.Wikileaks published the Clinton emails just hours after the U.S. government accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations.    In the emails, Clinton advisers discussed how to frame the candidate's ""energy infrastructure"" plan, which would call for replacing old pipelines, repairing rail tracks and improving the electric grid in a way that would appeal to labor unions, who had yet to endorse her at that stage.""Could we mention that ... as we transition HRC wants to create more careers within the new energy economy? Careers is their buzz word,"" wrote Nikki Budzinski, labor outreach director for Hillary for America.
Clinton had long avoided taking a firm position on Keystone, which had been pending for seven years, as she sought her party's nomination last year. As secretary of state, Clinton said in 2010 she was inclined to approve it. Rival Senator Bernie Sanders had been a staunch opponent of the pipeline. President Barack Obama did not reject the pipeline until November 2015.Labor unions have pushed for approval of the pipeline, saying it would create thousands of construction jobs while environmentalists opposed it because it would increase greenhouse gas emissions from Canada's oil sands.The emails show that North America's Building Trades, representing builders and construction workers, contacted the campaign after hearing that Obama would announce his denial of the pipeline in late August and that Clinton would say she ""encouraged"" him to make the decision.   
""We are so close to getting bldg (sic) trades [endorsement] and if we do this right, it will be ok even though they won't like it,"" wrote Amanda Renteria, the campaign's national political adviser.The Building Trades union endorsed Clinton in November and the Laborers' International Union of North America endorsed Clinton in December. Clinton's struggle to please both green and labor groups is likely to emerge as a key challenge if she is to win the presidency.
A decision over another pipeline, the Dakota Access, has sparked major protests from Native American and environmental groups.The Obama administration temporarily halted construction, frustrating unions.""These types of decisions made by this administration get dumped in the presidential race and it's kind of unfair,"" Sean McGarvey, president of North America's Building Trades Unions, told Reuters in an interview last month. ""We don't like all of Clinton's energy policies but we think it's reasonable."" (Reporting by Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)"	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Obama']	[]

By Rory Carroll and David Shepardson
| SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON

SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON A settlement with U.S. regulators gives Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) too much authority over how to spend $2 billion on electric vehicle technology, a U.S. congresswoman from California said this week in a letter, echoing concerns from states and others who fear the German automaker gains undue influence in the deal.Volkswagen agreed to spend $1.2 billion nationally and $800 million more in California on electric vehicle technology as penalties for equipping hundreds of thousands of diesel vehicles sold in the United States with software designed to cheat tailpipe emissions tests.The letter from Representative Anne Eshoo comes ahead of an Oct. 18 hearing at which a federal judge will consider whether to give final approval to $15.3 billion in settlements for owners, state and federal regulators or require changes and renegotiation.A provision ""of particular concern"" allows VW to make ""possible investments in its own proprietary technology and subsidiaries,"" Eshoo, a Democrat, said in the Oct. 4 letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lisa McCarthy.
The EPA declined to comment. VW was not immediately available for comment. It has urged the court approve the deal.Eshoo's fears mirror those raised by electric car-charging station companies in August.
Four members of the California state legislature, in comments to the U.S. Department of Justice, also urged independent oversight and administration of the VW funds ""to ensure that multiple vendors with cutting-edge technology are able to enter the market."" The Justice Department said last month it received 1,195 comments period from private citizens, state and local government offices and agencies, businesses, and institutions and associations. The DOJ urged the agreements be approved with only minor changes. 
Objectors face an uphill battle since U.S. courts generally give the government significant latitude to negotiate settlements. The Justice Department said nearly half of the comments were submitted on behalf of a company that provides truck-stop electrification services to long-haul truck drivers, IdleAir, urging that the VW program be allowed to fund such projects.

By Joseph Menn
| SAN FRANCISCO

SAN FRANCISCO A U.S. senator and civil groups critical of surveillance practices on Friday called on the government to release a 2015 order by a secret court directing Yahoo to scan all its users' incoming email, saying it appeared to involve new interpretations of at least two important legal issues.Their concerns center on the nature of the technical assistance the court required Yahoo to provide and the scope of the search that legal experts said appeared to cover the Silicon Valley internet company's entire network.Yahoo installed a custom software program to search messages to hundreds of millions of accounts at the behest of U.S. intelligence officials with an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a secret tribunal, Reuters reported on Tuesday.They were looking for messages containing a single piece of digital content, three former employees and a fourth person apprised of the events told Reuters.Intelligence officials told Reuters that all Yahoo had to do was modify existing systems for stopping child pornography from being sent through its email or filtering spam messages.But the pornography filters are aimed only at video and still images and cannot search text, as the Yahoo program did. The spam filters, meanwhile, are viewable by many employees who curate them, and there is no confusion about where they sit in the software stack and how they operate.
The court-ordered search Yahoo conducted, on the other hand, was done by a module attached to the Linux kernel - in other words, it was deeply buried near the core of the email server operating system, far below where mail sorting was handled, according to three former Yahoo employees.They said that made it hard to detect and also made it hard to figure out what the program was doing. How much companies can be forced to do to comply with government orders for searching data is being debated in the courts. Companies have successfully argued that changes that would degrade users' experience or force them to write new code, essentially a form of speech, would violate basic rights.Most famously, Apple refused to write code that would unlock an iPhone belonging to a gunman in last year's mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. The FBI later dropped its demand.
In the case of Yahoo, company security staff discovered a software program that was scanning email but ended an investigation when they found it had been approved by Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer, the sources said. Lawmakers are concerned about the request and whether information about it is being properly disclosed to the public.""Recent reports of a mass-email scanning program have alleged that federal law is being interpreted in ways that many Americans would find surprising and troubling,"" said Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a member of the intelligence committee and frequent critic of government surveillance programs.  
""The USA Freedom Act requires the executive branch to declassify Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court opinions that involve novel interpretations of laws or the Constitution,"" Wyden said. Intelligence officials said the Yahoo order resembled other requests for monitoring online communications of suspected terrorists. The program is far different from the bulk collection of emails and telephone records that was disclosed by fugitive National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, they said, stressing the target was a digital ""signature"" associated with a single entity's suspected terrorist activity.But legal experts question whether the order might have stretched the concept of a ""facility"" used by a foreign power from its traditional definition, involving a single phone number or an email account, to include a large company's entire communication network.""If the facility means all of Yahoo's network, I don't see how that's consistent with the Fourth Amendment,"" which bars unreasonable searches, said Greg Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy & Technology.

By David Brunnstrom
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama formally announced the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Myanmar on Friday by terminating an emergency order that deemed the policies of the former military government a threat to U.S. national security.""I have determined that the situation that gave rise to the national emergency ... has been significantly altered by Burma's (Myanmar's) substantial advances to promote democracy, including historic elections in November 2015,"" Obama said in a letter to the U.S. House and Senate speakers.A U.S. Treasury statement said that as a result of the termination of the emergency order the economic and financial sanctions administered by the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control were no longer in effect.The move followed a meeting between Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi and Obama in Washington last month, when she called for the lifting of economic sanctions against her country, and he said he was willing to do this.Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy won a sweeping victory in the November elections.
Obama's letter pointed to the formation of a democratically elected, civilian-led government as a result of the election, the release of many political prisoners and improved human rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression and freedom of association and peaceful assembly.""While Burma faces significant challenges, including the consolidation of its democracy, the United States can, and intends to, use other means to support the government and people of Burma in their efforts to address these challenges,"" Obama's letter said.Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and democracy icon, helped persuade the West to impose sanctions on Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, during her years as a jailed opposition leader. She is now trying to strike a balance between showing her people the economic rewards of a democratic transition while keeping pressure on the country's generals for further reforms.  
Some members of the U.S. Congress have expressed concerns about the extent and durability of change in Myanmar and introduced legislation seeking to give lawmakers some influence on the process of easing sanctions.Rights groups condemned last month's announcement, saying it  forfeited leverage on Myanmar's military.
Officials of the U.S. administration have said the removal of sanctions would not apply to military-to-military assistance, given the extent of the military's involvement in politics and rights abuses.Suu Kyi herself has been criticized for doing too little to address the plight of Myanmar's stateless Rohingya Muslim  minority.The State Department said last month that several restrictions would remain in place, including barring visas for military leaders.

Trump has faced repeated criticism for his comments about women, most recently involving his attacks on a former beauty queen with a vague and unsubstantiated allegation about a sex tape in predawn Twitter posts that prompted Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to denounce him as ""unhinged.""
