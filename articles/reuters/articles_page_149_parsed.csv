By Mark Hosenball and Arshad Mohammed
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON If the Russian government is behind the theft and release of embarrassing emails from the Democratic Party, as U.S. officials have suggested, it may reflect less a love of Donald Trump or enmity for Hillary Clinton than a desire to discredit the U.S. political system.A U.S. official who is taking part in the investigation said that intelligence collected on the hacking of Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails released by Wikileaks on Friday ""indicates beyond a reasonable doubt that it originated in Russia.""The timing on the eve of Clinton's formal nomination this week for the Nov. 8 presidential election has raised questions about whether Russia may have been trying to hurt her, to help Trump, her Republican rival, or to fan populist sentiment against establishment politicians as it has sought to do across Europe in recent years.""Certainly Russia has become a master at manipulating information for their strategic goals: Witness the information bubble they have created for their threatening behavior in the Crimea, the Ukraine and elsewhere,"" said former CIA and National Security Agency director Michael Hayden. ""A step like this, however, would be really upping their game.""The emails showed that DNC officials explored ways to undermine U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign against Clinton and raised questions about whether Sanders, who is Jewish, was really an atheist.The disclosures confirmed Sanders' frequent charge that the party played favorites against him and clouded a party convention Clinton hoped would signal unity, not division.PUTIN'S COUNTERPUNCH?
Two U.S. intelligence officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the hack could be part of a broader campaign by Russian President Vladimir Putin to push back against what he thinks is an effort by the European Union and NATO, a military alliance of European and North American democracies, to encircle and weaken Russia.
One of the officials called the fear ""a hangover"" from Putin's service in the KGB, the Soviet intelligence agency.""Time and again, we're seeing Russia push back at what Putin considers Russia's mortal enemies,"" said the other official. ""He's been actively attacking the U.S.-backed rebels in Syria, buzzing ships and planes in the Black Sea and the Baltic, not to mention invading Ukraine and seizing Crimea. This fits the pattern.""Despite Clinton's short-lived attempt as secretary of state to ""reset"" U.S.-Russian relations after U.S. President Barack Obama took office in 2009, the leaked emails could damage a candidate the Kremlin may consider hostile and benefit her opponent, who has been friendlier.Putin accused Clinton of stirring up protests against his rule after a December 2011 Russian parliamentary election that was marred by allegations of fraud, saying she had encouraged ""mercenary"" Kremlin foes by criticizing the vote.""She set the tone for some opposition activists, gave them a signal, they heard this signal and started active work,"" Putin told supporters.
Asked about claims that Russian intelligence had hacked the DNC to obtain the emails, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange told NBC News' Richard Engel ""there is no proof of that whatsoever"" and said ""this is a diversion"" pushed by the Clinton campaign.TRUMP'S WARMER TONEAnalysts said Russia's goal may be much broader than simply meddling in the U.S. presidential election.""It's a gross oversimplification to suggest that the Russian government is all-in for Donald Trump,"" said Andrew Weiss, a Russia analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington-based think tank.""It's in Russia's interest ... to portray the United States as riven with popular discontent, xenophobia and high-level political corruption,"" Weiss said. ""It fits nicely with the Kremlin's standard narrative ... that the White House rushes to criticize others without getting its own house in order.""
The Russian leader may well have been encouraged by Trump's comments to The New York Times last week that with him in the White House, NATO might not automatically defend the Baltic states that were once a part of the Russian-led Soviet Union.    Despite public Trump-Putin exchanges of praise, Eugene Rumer, a former national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia, warned against reaching any quick conclusions about Putin's view of Trump.    ""We can say with some degree of confidence that they don't like Hillary,"" Rumer said. ""It's less clear that they like Trump, although over the years the Russians have said they prefer to deal with the Republicans - (that) they are kind of hard-line but they can do deals.""A diplomat with experience working on Russia said the Kremlin also might be betting that Clinton will win and is sending a shot across her bow.    ""Messing with her like this now puts her on notice that these are tough guys that she's got to be really careful with,"" said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.A U.S. intelligence official who is reviewing the emails as part of the investigation into their origin said that those emails describing the privileges the Democratic National Committee showers on its wealthiest donors bolster the Russian narrative of an American political system rigged by the wealthy and riddled with corruption.""In addition to countering the U.S. narrative that the Russian government is a corrupt oligarchy, leaking these emails fits rather conveniently with Trump's charges about a rigged system and 'crooked Hillary',"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss domestic politics.

| PHILADELPHIA

PHILADELPHIA It should have been a triumphant night for Hillary Clinton when her rival Bernie Sanders gave a rousing speech urging his supporters to vote for her in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.Instead it turned into a sign of potential trouble for her White House bid. His speech on Monday to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia urging the party to unite against Republican Donald Trump was met with some jeers when he endorsed Clinton - a sign he had lost control of his own movement.""I'm beyond disappointed,"" California delegate Aleece Depuey, 49, said after Sanders sought to rally support for his one-time rival.  Hundreds of Sanders supporters marched through the streets on Day One of the four-day convention, chanting: ""We want Bernie!"" Delegates wore ""Bernie or Bust"" buttons. Others donned Robin Hood-style hats, a call to redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor. When he spoke, a scuffle broke out between a Sanders supporter and a Clinton supporter in the hall. The backlash raised questions over whether - and how - Clinton could ever win over Sanders supporters. With opinion polls showing the Clinton-Trump race tightening, Clinton needs Sanders' voters more than ever. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, arrived in Philadelphia with 1,894 of 4,763 delegates after winning 13 million votes in the Democratic nominating contest.To many of Sanders' backers, Clinton is a bridge too far. They see her as the kind of political insider, backed by reams of corporate money, that drove them to Sanders and his fight to rein in Wall Street and remove income inequality. Others simply do not trust her, opinion polls show. In a Reuters/Ipsos poll released at the end of June, some 15 percent of Sanders' backers said they would vote for Trump, and 19 percent would support neither Clinton nor Trump.Sanders won the states of Colorado, Indiana, Michigan, and New Hampshire in the run-up to the convention, and nearly won Iowa - all states that could be closely contested by Trump in the general election. Clinton likely will need some portion of Sanders' support to stay competitive in those states. 
'HILLARY FOR PRISON'
Clinton's campaign had hoped in Philadelphia to put the bare-knuckle primary fight behind it, but Sanders' voters were enraged by Friday's embarrassing release of internal party emails by the activist group WikiLeaks showing party officials clearly favored Clinton over their candidate. Sanders supporters seemed to be everywhere, often with a bigger presence than Clinton supporters, a jarring sight at an event where she is due to be formally nominated as the party's presidential candidate.  At a delegate welcoming event on Sunday night, shouts of ""Bernie!"" filled the air as his supporters circulated a petition to force convention organizers to hold an extended roll-call vote on the floor this week that would require each delegate to declare his or her support.Others pledged to contest Clinton's choice of Democrat Tim Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia, as her running mate. 
When at mid-day Sanders addressed more than a thousand of his delegates at the city's convention center, the crowd erupted in fury when he asked them to switch their allegiance to Clinton.""Brothers and sisters,"" he said over their jeers, ""this is the real world that we live in. Trump is a bully and a demagogue."" People started shouting back: ""So is Hillary!""Sanders did not mention Clinton again. But he already had lost the attention of some of his most fervent fans.""As soon as he said back Clinton, everyone stopped listening,"" said Cindy Melchert, a protester who listened to the appeal over a loudspeaker at a local park.A Michigan native, Melchert said she would not vote for Clinton in November under any circumstances. For her, the movement now was less about Sanders and more about showing the Democratic National Committee ""they had us and absolutely lost us.""Another protester, Michael Arnold of Atlanta, would not have been out of place at a Trump rally, sporting a T-shirt that read ""Hillary for prison."" 
SEEKING DECORUM 
Fearing a similar scene on the convention floor would embarrass Clinton, Sanders' campaign emailed delegates before Monday night's program, urging them to restrain themselves.""Our credibility as a movement will be damaged by booing, turning of backs, walking out or other similar displays,"" it read.Some Sanders supporters appeared willing to set aside their qualms about Clinton, largely out of a desire to see Trump defeated in the election. Diana Hatsis-Neuhoff, a delegate from Florida adorned with buttons backing Sanders, said she planned to vote for Clinton in the general election.""Yes,"" she said, ""we'll hold our nose and vote.""Others felt their fellow Sanders supporters had taken the movement too far. ""We are surrounded by people who are so selfish and so self-absorbed,"" said Melissa Robbins, who worked for the Sanders campaign in Philadelphia. ""Not voting for Hillary is a sure win for Donald Trump.""But that may not be enough to sway Sue Spicer from Indiana, who said she had trouble imagining voting for either Clinton or Trump. ""It's hard to feel they have our best interests in mind,"" she said.

By Luciana Lopez and Amy Tennery
| PHILADELPHIA

PHILADELPHIA Democrats divided over the future of their party agreed on at least one thing at their national convention in Philadelphia on Monday night: Michelle Obama was a star.The first lady gave a speech in support of a former first lady, presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, and described America as ""the greatest country on earth"", clashing with Republican Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan and bringing an arena crowd riven by a fierce fight for the nomination to its feet.""I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves, and I watch my daughters - two beautiful, intelligent, black young women - playing with their dogs on the White House lawn,"" Michelle Obama said. Obama's husband, President Barack Obama, for years has drawn praise for his oratorical skills. But Monday night belonged to her.""Don't let anyone ever tell you that this country isn't great, that somehow we need to make it great again, because this right now is the greatest country on earth,"" she said.The speech triggered wild applause among delegates in the Wells Fargo Center, where anger over Senator Bernie Sanders' loss in the primary elections against Clinton had taken the form of jeers during speeches earlier in the day. 
Some Sanders supporters had called out at some points early in Obama's speech, but were shushed.Garry Mauro, head of the Clinton delegation for Texas, called Michelle Obama's speech ""stunningly good."" Several Twitter users said the speech brought them to tears, while others marveled at its positive tone in an election year marked by blunt exchanges. ""Mrs. Obama deconstructed Trump's entire campaign without using a single pejorative word,"" Twitter user @weddady said in a post after the speech. ""Mrs Obama's speech also disassembled Trump's entire narrative without ever mentioning his name.""
Michelle Obama became the top searched speaker of the night on Google. On Twitter, about 40 tweets mentioning the first lady were posted every second, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph.The president lauded her performance.""Incredible speech by an incredible woman. Couldn't be more proud & our country has been blessed to have her as FLOTUS. I love you, Michelle,"" he wrote in a Twitter post, using an acronym for first lady of the United States.
His tweet became the most re-tweeted post of the night.Michelle Obama, a lawyer who has advocated for military families and working women during her seven-and-a-half years as first lady, has earned a reputation for inspirational speeches. Last week, during the Republican National Convention, Trump's wife Melania delivered a speech that appeared to borrow phrases from Michelle Obama's convention speech in 2008, drawing accusations of plagiarism. A Trump Organization staff writer accepted responsibility for the similarities.""One can completely understand why people plagiarize Michelle Obama,"" actress Mia Farrow said in a Twitter post after the first lady's speech.

By Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON An email leak that led to the resignation of Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz could plague her bid for re-election to Congress, after a challenger said on Monday he would file a complaint alleging she had broken election rules.Political newcomer Tim Canova, who is challenging Wasserman Schultz in the Aug. 30 Democratic primary for her House of Representatives seat representing Florida's 23rd Congressional District, said he would file the complaint against her with the U.S. Federal Election Commission.Wasserman Schultz said on Sunday she would be stepping down as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee after Wikileaks released more than 19,000 emails showing Democratic officials had worked to undermine U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders in his presidential primary battle with Hillary Clinton.Canova suggested that the leaked emails also showed Wasserman Schultz had used the party's resources in her congressional campaign against Canova in south Florida. Sanders has endorsed Canova in that race. ""The Wikileaks emails indicate that Debbie Wasserman Schultz used DNC resources to assist her reelection campaign in violation of federal law. According to the emails, top DNC officials used party resources to monitor, respond to, and impede my campaign on numerous occasions,"" Canova said in a statement emailed to Reuters by his campaign.
""My campaign election lawyers are investigating these circumstances and preparing a complaint against Wasserman Schultz with the Federal Election Commission,"" Canova said. He also repeated his call for a series of campaign debates with Wasserman Schultz.Searching for Canova's name in the cache of emails released by WikiLeaks turned up dozens of emails. One indicated Wasserman Schultz had asked staffers to take Canova's name out of a headline on a statement that was being sent out in response to Sanders's endorsement of Canova.Sanders told CNN in May that he favored Canova, saying ""His views are much closer to mine than as to Wasserman Schultz's."" 
Canova's south Florida campaign for Congress has reflected some of the themes that Sanders used nationwide to appeal to progressives, including a push for campaign finance reform.Canova has also been a critic of financial deregulation and the Federal Reserve Board under former Chairman Alan Greenspan, according to his biography on the website at Nova Southeastern University, where he is a professor of law and public finance.
Sanders made attacks on Wall Street a central theme of his presidential campaign, and called for structural reforms in the Fed.Since Sanders' endorsement, Canova has almost caught up with Wasserman Schultz in fundraising. Canova has raised $2.27 million so far; Wasserman Schultz has raised $2.81 million, according to the most recent Federal Election Commission filings.   There are also two Republicans seeking Wasserman Schultz's seat in Congress, Martin Feigenbaum and Joe Kaufman. (Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"	['Schultz', 'Sanders', 'Clinton']	[]

By Steve Holland
| WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. Republican nominee Donald Trump said on Monday that if elected U.S. president he would weigh an alliance with Russia against Islamic State militants but rejected any suggestion Russian President Vladimir Putin might be trying to help him win.Speaking at a rally in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Trump dismissed any suggestion that Putin's intelligence services might have had a hand in hacking the Democratic National Committee's email system.Emails leaked last week disclosed that some party officials had been in favor of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton winning the Democratic presidential nomination over U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and sought ways to thwart Sanders.The uproar over the WikiLeaks revelations prompted Debbie Wasserman Schultz to resign as DNC chairwoman, and Trump eagerly injected himself into the controversy.Trump dismissed a charge from Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook that Russian hackers might have stolen the emails and leaked them to embarrass Democrats and help Trump defeat Clinton in the Nov. 8 election.""I don't think it's coincidental that these emails were released on the eve of our convention here, and I think that's disturbing,"" Mook told CNN's ""State of the Union.""Trump dismissed what he called ""one of the weirdest conspiracy theories"" he said he had heard.
He said he had never met Putin. But over the course of his year-long campaign, Trump has praised the Russian leader and one of his top foreign policy advisers, retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, had dinner with Putin last December.""When you think about it, wouldn't it be nice if we got along with Russia?"" Trump said. ""Wouldn't it be nice if we got together with Russia and knocked the hell out of ISIS?"" he added, using another name for Islamic State.As it happens, skeptics in the U.S. government, European allies in the anti-Islamic State coalition and the main Syrian opposition, distrustful of Russia's intentions, are questioning Secretary of State John Kerry's own latest proposal for closer U.S.-Russian cooperation against militant groups in Syria.
TRUMP ASSAILS AIR CONDITIONING
Trump, kicking off a three-day campaign swing with his vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, returned to his freewheeling style after giving a scripted speech on Thursday accepting the Republican presidential nomination.During an earlier event in Roanoke, Virginia, Trump labeled Clinton ""low-energy,"" the same characterization he lobbed at Republican rival Jeb Bush; attacked her running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia; and complained about the air conditioning in the hotel ballroom where he spoke.
""I think the ballroom and the people who own this hotel ought to be ashamed of themselves,"" Trump said.Trump made light of Democratic disunity as party loyalists gathered in Philadelphia on Monday to anoint Clinton as their nominee this week, after a week in which Republicans struggled to unite behind Trump at their convention in Cleveland.Trump waved away Republican disunity as essentially isolated pockets of resistance and made an apparent reference to U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, who was booed in Cleveland when he would not endorse Trump after losing to him in a bitter primary race.""We had a couple people who probably destroyed their career, but who knows,"" Trump said. ""Look what's going on in Philadelphia. ... We had no riots, no nothing. It was unbelievable. I'll never forget it as long as I live.""On Twitter, Trump added, ""Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess.""

By John Whitesides
| PHILADELPHIA

PHILADELPHIA The head of the Democratic Party resigned on Sunday amid a furor over embarrassing leaked emails, hoping to head off a growing rebellion by Bernie Sanders supporters on the eve of the convention to nominate Hillary Clinton for the White House.Lingering bitterness from the heated primary campaign between Clinton and Sanders erupted after more than 19,000 Democratic National Committee emails, leaked on Friday, confirmed Sanders' frequent charge that the party played favorites in the race.In a statement, DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said the best way for the party to accomplish its goal of putting Clinton in the White House was for her to step aside after the convention. Sanders had demanded earlier in the day that Wasserman Schultz resign.The furor was a blow to a party keen on projecting stability in contrast to the volatility of Republican candidate Donald Trump, who was formally nominated at a raucous convention in Cleveland last week.It also overshadowed preparations in Philadelphia for Clinton's coronation as the nominee to face Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election. She will be the first woman nominated for president by a major U.S. political party. The four-day Democratic convention will open on Monday. In some good news for Clinton, The New York Times reported that businessman and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg will endorse her in a prime-time speech on Monday, saying she will be the best choice for moderate voters in 2016.The cache of emails leaked on Friday by the WikiLeaks website disclosed that DNC officials explored ways to undermine Sanders' insurgent presidential campaign, including raising questions about whether Sanders, who is Jewish, was really an atheist.Sanders said Wasserman Schultz, a U.S. representative from Florida, had made the right decision for the future of the Democratic Party. ""The party leadership must also always remain impartial in the presidential nominating process, something which did not occur in the 2016 race,"" he said.'RUSSIAN CONNECTION?'
The Clinton camp questioned whether Russians may have had a hand in the hack attack on the party's emails and were interested in helping Trump, who has exchanged words of praise with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
""What's disturbing to us is that experts are telling us that Russian state actors broke into the DNC, stole these emails and other experts are now saying that Russians are releasing these emails for the purpose of helping Donald Trump,"" Clinton campaign chairman Robby Mook said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort said the Clinton camp was trying to distract from its party discord ahead of the convention.""What's in those emails show that it was a clearly rigged system, that Bernie Sanders ... never had a chance,""Manafort said on ABC. Clinton, 68, a former secretary of state, and Sanders, 74, an independent U.S. senator from Vermont who ran for president as a Democrat, waged a bruising months-long battle for the nomination. Branding himself a democratic socialist, Sanders galvanized young and liberal voters with his calls to rein in Wall Street and eradicate income inequality.   But Sanders repeatedly voiced frustration with a DNC and party establishment he felt was stacked against him, and the resentment from Sanders and his supporters threatened to disrupt the convention.
""I'm not shocked but I'm disappointed,"" Sanders said of the emails earlier on Sunday on ABC's ""This Week.""The emails showed DNC officials pondering various ways to undercut Sanders. Brad Marshall, the DNC's chief financial officer, apologized on Facebook on Saturday for an email in which he discussed how some voters in upcoming nominating contests in Kentucky and West Virginia would reject an atheist.""He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage,"" Marshall wrote in a May 5 email to three top DNC officials. No names were mentioned, but Sanders was the only Jewish candidate.""I think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist.""Clinton told CBS's ""60 Minutes"" in an interview that aired on Sunday that she had not read any of the emails but it was ""wrong and unacceptable"" to bring religion into the political process.
SANDERS SUPPORTERS ANGRY
The emails angered many Sanders supporters who were already dismayed by Clinton's choice on Friday of low-key U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia as her vice presidential running mate. Kaine, 58, who could appeal to independents and moderates, has never been aligned with party liberals.Sanders, who has endorsed Clinton and will speak on her behalf to the convention on Monday, said he would have preferred she pick U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a favorite of the party's liberal wing, as her No. 2.""I have known Tim Kaine for a number of years. ... Tim is a very, very smart guy. He is a very nice guy,"" Sanders said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""He is more conservative than I am. Would I have preferred to see somebody like an Elizabeth Warren selected by Secretary Clinton? Yes, I would have,"" he said. Carrying pitchforks meant to portray Clinton as the devil, hundreds of Sanders supporters took to the streets of Philadelphia earlier on Sunday to say they felt betrayed by the DNC.""It just validated everything we thought, everything we believed to be true, that this was completely rigged right from the beginning, and that you know it was really about what they were doing everything to set it up so she would win,"" Sanders supporter Gwen Sperling said.DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile will serve as interim chair through the election, the DNC said on Twitter.

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee called on the Obama administration on Monday to ask Congress for more money to fund its plans for Iraq and Afghanistan, amid expectations of a defense budget battle when lawmakers return to Washington this fall.""The administration needs to come over with a supplemental (budget request),"" Republican Representative Mac Thornberry said at a roundtable discussion with reporters shortly after returning from a trip to Iraq and Afghanistan.He said U.S. and allied forces were making progress in Afghanistan and in the fight against Islamic State militants in Iraq, but that stiff challenges remained in both campaigns.Thornberry and other congressional Republicans have been saying President Barack Obama must formally request additional funds for the fiscal year that starts on Oct. 1 since he announced plans earlier this month to send more troops to Iraq and keep more in Afghanistan than had been expected.
The request for more troops, without a plan to pay for them, added another wrinkle to the simmering dispute between the Republican-led Congress and the Democratic administration over spending. Obama has threatened to veto a $602 billion defense policy bill because of its use of special funds for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to avoid mandatory budget limits.Democrats say the Department of Defense should be subject to the same spending restrictions as non-military programs. Republicans accuse Democrats of stinting on national security in order to fund pet domestic projects.""That is holding our military hostage,"" Thornberry said.
The congressman said he had had no official numbers from the Pentagon but that he had been told it faces roughly $6 billion more in expenses than when the administration made its budget request earlier this year.He said military commanders in Afghanistan were grappling with how to handle Obama's plan to reduce the number of troops in Afghanistan to 8,448 by December 31 from about 9,800 currently.
They are looking into using more contractors and whether some functions can be moved out of Afghanistan, Thornberry said. Defense Secretary Ash Carter has said the Pentagon was evaluating how to proceed, comparing its estimated costs with what is already in its budgets.
