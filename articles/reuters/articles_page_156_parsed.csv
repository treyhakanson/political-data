| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND City police on bicycles and horseback, backed by state and local officers from across the country, kept order outside the Republican National Convention on Tuesday, as predictions that protester unrest would tarnish the event did not come to pass for a second day.There have been only five arrests since the convention began on Monday, police announced at an early evening news conference. As sundown neared, the mood on downtown streets was calm.In Tuesday's largest demonstration, police on bicycles rode into the crowd in the city's Public Square in mid afternoon. Helmeted officers, some in protective equipment and others wearing shorts, separated a crowd of Black Lives Matters protesters from other protesters wearing masks and helmets, occasionally lifting their bikes to push through the crowd.""If America is so bad, why don't you leave?,"" a pro-Trump demonstrator shouted at a group carrying signs that read, ""America was never great""A pair of men dressed in traditional Muslim garb walked near the plaza carrying assault-style rifles, with one also bearing a semiautomatic handgun.
Micha Noziri of Yellow Spring, Ohio, who is not Muslim, said he wanted to take a stance against Trump's positions on ""religious minorities"" and immigration. ""We came out to show solidarity for all minority groups, the so-called minority groups that Donald Trump would oppress if he does the things that he says,"" Noziri told a knot of reporters surrounding him.Ten men identifying themselves as Ohio militia walked through Public Square with weapons on open display, surrounded by a pack of journalists. 
Police escorted conservative radio host Alex Jones from the square, amid shouting and jostling, after Jones used a megaphone to shout invective about Black Lives Matter and other groups toward a group of liberal-leaning protesters.  Dozens of Cleveland police on bicycles and dozens more in state police uniforms intervened. They walked Jones and a handful of supporters past a few hundred demonstrators and journalists. 
One Trump supporter, Elam Stoltzfus, said he felt ""very safe"" watching the scene.""About 150 police were here in a minute,"" Stoltzfus said in reference to events that led up to Jones' being escorted away. ""Ohio is an open-carry state; we have a lot of protection here.""Earlier Tuesday, police arrested three people for climbing flagpoles near Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and hanging a banner with the words, ""Don't Trump Our Communities."" Firefighters used a ladder truck to assist in the arrest, police officials said.

CLEVELAND Melania Trump's speech at the Republican National Convention has ignited controversy because it contained a section strikingly similar to words delivered at the Democratic convention in 2008 by the woman she hopes to succeed as U.S. first lady, Michelle Obama.An official with the campaign of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump suggested the similarity in the section to Michelle Obama's speech may have been the result of an error by her team of speech writers.Donald Trump made no mention of the issue in a Twitter post early on Tuesday, saying simply: ""It was truly an honor to introduce my wife, Melania Trump last night. Her speech and demeanor were absolutely incredible. Very proud!""Trump has never held elective office and his White House campaign has been marked by frequent controversy over unorthodox policies and freewheeling remarks that have alarmed many in the Republican establishment.It is a tradition of the party conventions for spouses to offer an enthusiastic personal endorsement of candidates. On Tuesday night, the gathering in Cleveland will formally anoint Donald Trump the Republican presidential candidate for the Nov. 8 election.It was a small section of Melania Trump's roughly 15-minute speech, a highlight of the opening day of the convention, that was similar to a part of Michelle Obama's speech in 2008 in support of Barack Obama, who was then campaigning for president.""My parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise; that you treat people with respect,"" said Melania Trump, a Slovenian-born jewelry designer and former model.""They taught me to show the values and morals in my daily life. That is the lesson that I continue to pass along to our son,"" she said.""And we need to pass those lessons on to the many generations to follow, because we want our children in this nation to know that the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.""In 2008, Michelle Obama said, ""And Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say you're going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect.""
""...And Barack Obama and I set out to build lives guided by these values, and pass them on to the next generations,"" she added.""Because we want our children, and all children in this nation, to know that the only limit to the height of your achievement is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.""Before Monday's speech, Melania Trump told NBC in remarks that were aired on several networks: ""I wrote it... with as little help as possible.""A spokesman for the Trump campaign called the speech a success, but suggested her writers might have mistakenly injected some borrowed language.""In writing her beautiful speech, Melania's team of writers took notes on her life's inspirations, and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking,"" Jason Miller, Trump's senior communications adviser, said in a statement.
A 'COLLABORATION'
Paul Manafort, chairman of the Trump campaign, played down the similarities in the Trump and Obama speeches.""There aren't that many similarities. There are a couple of phrases,"" Manafort told CBS News on Tuesday. ""It's basically three places in the speech and it's fragments of words. She spoke in front of 35 million people yesterday. She knew what she was doing. And she never cribbed from another speech without acknowledging that she was quoting somebody else.""
""There was nothing that she did in that speech that she thought was anybody's words but herself,"" Manafort said.Asked if she wrote it herself, Manafort said it was a ""collaboration"" and he didn't know how much exactly she had written. ""But the words of her speech reflect her feelings for her husband, her country and her family.""""Frankly this was her vision that she wanted to communicate about her husband.""New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, asked if as a former prosecutor he could make a case for plagiarism from Melania Trump's speech, replied: ""No, not when 93 percent of the speech is completely different from Michelle Obama's speech, and they express common thoughts.""""I think after tonight we won't be talking about this, we'll move on to whatever ... comes up tonight,"" Christie, a former rival to Trump for the Republican presidential nomination who now supports him, told NBC's Today show on Tuesday.(This story corrects to show Melania interview was with NBC, paragraph 13) (Reporting by Richard Valdmanis and Eric Walsh; Editing by John Stonestreet and Frances Kerry)"	['Paul', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

By James Oliphant and Amy Tennery
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND Donald Trump's tough talk on law and order in a time of growing national insecurity appears to be winning over some of his fiercest skeptics - women initially put off by his swaggering tone, his clashes with female critics and past affairs. But so far those are mostly conservative women. As Trump hones his message, the challenge is to make it also resonate among independent or undecided female voters who are crucial to his hopes of winning the U.S. presidential election in November.Turmoil on the streets both abroad and at home could give Trump a new opportunity to do just that.On Monday, Trump tried to seize it with an evening program at the Republican National Convention with several women speakers, including his wife Melania, focused on security. She told the convention that her husband would offer the country new leadership and keep it ""safe and secure.""Americans have been rattled by recent attacks in France and Florida, the murder of police officers in Texas and Louisiana, and widespread protests over the killings of unarmed black men, polls show.""We're not electing a husband, we're not electing a preacher, we're electing a leader,"" said Kay White, a Republican delegate to the nominating convention from Tennessee who originally supported U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the early nominating contests, or primaries.For White, it's a one-issue election. ""Security,"" she said. ""Nothing else matters.""A year ago, Penny Nance, president of Concerned Women for America, a conservative advocacy group, was a blistering critic of the thrice-married Trump because of comments he made about  Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly that many felt were sexist. But Nance now supports Trump and says the candidate can fashion an effective message for women centered on national security, she told Reuters on the sidelines of the convention. ""Every day we wake up and get our kids ready for school and the television is on and there is another attack,"" she said.
""SECURITY MOMS""
For Trump, independents will be a tougher sell. A majority of women who identify as ""independent"" continue to hold an unfavorable opinion of him.According to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll from June 1 to July 15, 64 percent of independent women voters expressed a ""very unfavorable"" or ""somewhat unfavorable"" view of Trump. That compares with 89 percent of Democratic women voters and 31 percent of Republican women voters who have a similarly unfavorable view of the New York businessman. 
Trump isn't the first candidate whose tough talk on security has won over women voters. George W. Bush used the same message in his re-election campaign in 2004, in the midst of his ""war on terror,"" to appeal to so-called security moms who were concerned about terrorism. Bush garnered 48 percent of the vote of American women in that election. By comparison, Republican candidate Mitt Romney drew 44 percent in 2012, a full 10 points behind President Barack Obama. Trump has had trouble convincing women nationally to support him ever since he entered the race in the summer of 2015, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. Among women who are expected to vote on Nov. 8, a majority expressed an unfavorable opinion of him every time they were asked in the polls.This month, women appeared to have soured even more on the likely Republican nominee: 69 percent of likely women voters expressed an unfavorable opinion of Trump in the latest July 11-15 Reuters/Ipsos polling, up from 63 percent in the five-day poll that ended on July 1. Jen Lawless, director of the Women and Politics Institute at American University, said she doubted Trump could rehabilitate his image with most women voters, saying his conflict with Kelly, in particular, had lasting damage.
""I think that ship has sailed,"" Lawless said. Trump's problems with women were dramatized on Monday when Women for Trump, a voter-support group, held a sparsely attended event in Cleveland. The moderator, Jennifer Hulsey, appeared to speak for a lot of women who have found a way to support Trump. ""He's not perfect, but neither am I,"" Hulsey said. Some of the women delegates interviewed by Reuters at the convention on Monday were scornful of the criticism of Trump's attitude toward women, pointing to his daughter Ivanka, who is a top executive in the Trump Organization. Ivanka and his other daughter Tiffany are due to speak at the convention this week.""He was not my first choice or even my second choice,"" said   Carol Del Carlo, a Trump supporter. But, ""I look at him and I see how he treats his daughters. They're engaged, they look like a real, true family, they work in their father's business, they're advisors.""

By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump narrowed his deficit to Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to 7 percentage points from 15 points late last week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, Polling was under way on Tuesday at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland to officially nominate Trump as the party's candidate for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Clinton is due to be officially nominated at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia next week.Forty-three percent of likely voters supported Clinton in the July 15-19 poll, while 36 percent supported Trump. The poll included 1,069 voters and had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points. The previous poll, in which Trump trailed Clinton by 15 percentage points, covered the five-day period that ended July 14. Trump's rise appeared partly fueled by a decline in the number of voters who remained on the sidelines. The percentage of voters who supported neither candidate dropped to 12 percent in the July 15-19 poll from 15 percent in the July 10-14 poll.
Clinton has led in the poll most of the year. The last time that Trump matched Clinton's level of support was in mid-May, after his remaining rivals for the Republican nomination dropped out and many Republican leaders started to openly support his bid for the White House. 
This week's Republican convention provides another opportunity for party leaders to publicly embrace Trump's campaign.Presidential nominees typically see a boost in voter support following their party conventions. In 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney jumped by about 5 percentage points in the Reuters/Ipsos poll following the Republican convention.This year, however, Republican leaders have struggled to give a full-throated endorsement of Trump's ""America First"" campaign over his hard line on immigration and trade, and his fiery rhetoric that some have called bigoted.
Many Republican elders, including both former presidents Bush and the last two presidential nominees, Romney and John McCain, are staying away from Cleveland. The convention also has been marred by protests from anti-Trump delegates and a controversy over a speech by Trump's wife, Melania, that included a section that was strikingly similar to a portion of the speech given by Michelle Obama at the Democratic convention in 2008 when her husband, Barack Obama, was seeking his first term as president.

Melania Trump's big night at the Republican National Convention failed to draw bumper television audiences despite networks boosting their coverage of the gathering and husband Donald Trump promising a ""showbiz"" feel to the week.According to Nielsen ratings data on Tuesday from seven leading broadcast and cable networks, an estimated 23 million people watched Monday evening's highlight during the 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. hour when Melania Trump, the wife of Republican White House contender Donald Trump, delivered her speech.The focus of the convention initially shifted on Tuesday from the formal anointing of Trump to accusations that sections of Melania Trump's speech were strikingly similar to an address by Michelle Obama at the Democratic convention in 2008.The early viewing figures were similar to those for the first night of the Republican convention in 2012, which attracted an audience of 22.3 million, according to Nielsen. 
U.S. television networks have boosted coverage of the Republican convention this year after Trump, a New York businessman, drew huge audiences during the 2016 presidential debates during the state nominating contests. Trump, the former star of ""The Apprentice"" TV show, has promised to throw out traditional political convention scripts and ""put some showbiz"" into the mix. Media analysts predicted that viewership for Trump's acceptance speech this week for the Republican presidential nomination could surpass the record 38 million who watched Barack Obama address the Democratic convention in 2008.
In 2012, the Democratic convention generally drew more nightly TV viewers than the Republican gathering, when Mitt Romney was running for the White House.On Monday, the Fox News cable channel, as expected, got the most viewers for its convention coverage, averaging 6.4 million in the 10 p.m. hour. Among the mainstream networks, NBC led with 3.9 million.
However, the biggest single program audience of Monday night was for reality show ""The Bachelorette,"" which was seen by some  6.6 million on ABC. About 3 million people turned off when ABC switched to the convention.

CLEVELAND Three women were arrested on Tuesday after climbing a flagpole near the site of this week's U.S. Republican National Convention and hanging a banner protesting the party's presidential candidate, Donald Trump.""Don't Trump our communities,"" read the banner hung near Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Using a ladder truck, fire officials brought down the protesters and the banner, which also had an anti-fracking message.""They actually climbed the flagpole and hung a banner and our officers responded and made the arrests,"" Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams told reporters. ""They were arrested for criminal mischief.""
He did not identify the people arrested. A Reuters witness who saw the incident said they were all women.A total of five people have now been arrested during the convention and its run-up; earlier one man was arrested for trying to steal a police officer's gas mask and a woman was arrested on an outstanding warrant unrelated to protest activity.
The convention, which began on Monday and runs through Thursday, has been marked by largely peaceful protests so far. The event will formally anoint Trump, a wealthy New York real estate developer, as the Republican nominee to face Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election.
""We are still making sure that we don't let our guard down,"" Williams said, adding that the department's strategy was to try to de-escalate tense situations.

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Merrick Garland hit an unwanted milestone on Tuesday as the federal appeals court judge's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court reached its 125th day with no Senate action, tying for the longest pending nomination ever to the high court.In a move with little precedent in American history, the Republicans who control the Senate have simply refused to take any action on President Barack Obama's nomination of Garland, 63, for a lifetime job on the nation's top court.Having been nominated on March 16 to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13, Garland, chief judge of the federal appeals court in Washington, has now matched Louis Brandeis for the longest time between nomination and Senate action.In 1916, the Senate voted to confirm Brandeis, making him America's first Jewish justice.The U.S. Constitution assigns the Senate the power to confirm the president's nominations to the Supreme Court. The Senate's inaction on Garland has made the court vacancy a key political prize in a presidential election year.Republicans, hopeful of winning back the White House from the Democrats in the Nov. 8 election, insist that Obama's successor name Scalia's replacement, who could have a lasting effect on the ideological balance of a court now split with four liberals and four conservatives.Obama has appointed two of the current justices: liberals Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor.The White House and its allies made another push on Tuesday to highlight Republican intransigence.""Now, despite Chief Judge Garland's extraordinary qualifications, Republicans in the Senate have refused to do their job, and Chief Judge Garland's nomination has now been pending longer than any Supreme Court nominee in history who's nomination was not otherwise withdrawn,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters.
""Despite his outstanding record and qualifications, Republicans have obstructed Judge Garland's nomination in a way faced by no other Supreme Court nominee in our nation's history,"" added Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid.The Senate is on recess until September.For the rival presidential hopefuls, Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, the Supreme Court vacancy is both a political problem and an opportunity. 
IDEOLOGICAL BALANCE
In addition to Scalia's replacement, the next president conceivably could nominate as many as three more justices. Three of the court's current eight members already are over age 77. That means Obama's successor could influence the court's ideological direction for decades.Some conservatives view Trump with suspicion. But the wealthy New York real estate developer has already floated names of conservative potential nominees in a bid to mollify some on the right.Garland has established a reputation as a centrist in 19 years as an appellate judge. Some liberal Democrats have said Clinton, if elected, could put forth a nominee more liberal than Garland, so Republicans would be smart to approve him before Obama leaves office on Jan. 20.Such arguments have not swayed Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who refuses to let Garland come to a vote.
The development most likely to prod Senate action is the result of the presidential election. Some Republican senators have said if Clinton wins, the Senate should confirm Garland in a ""lame-duck"" post-election session out of fear Clinton would name someone far more liberal. If Clinton wins, she also could renominate Garland upon taking office.Garland's nomination is unusual because there has been no controversy over his suitability to sit on the Supreme Court, as there have been with some nominees in the past. He is widely respected in the legal community and has been praised by both Democrats and Republicans as a moderate.The White House tried to persuade Republicans to accept Garland when he was first nominated in March. He met with 61 of the 100 senators. But the effort fizzled, and Republicans largely followed McConnell's lead.The White House since then has tried to keep the Garland nomination in the public eye, with limited success. Obama wrote an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal on Monday, pushing for Senate action.A White House-allied group called the Constitutional Responsibility Project is running a ""We Need Nine"" campaign that refers to the number of justices on a fully staffed court. It has bought ads in Cleveland, where the Republican presidential nominating convention began on Monday, calling for senators to ""do your job"" and bring Garland's nomination to a Senate vote.In the meantime, Garland is nowhere to be seen. His last public appearance was on June 15 when he spoke at an elementary school commencement event in Washington.When nominated, Garland stepped aside from pending cases before the appeals court where he works. His only official duties now are administrative as the court's chief judge. A court official said Garland will continue to not participate in cases while the nomination is pending.
