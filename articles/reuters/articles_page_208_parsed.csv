| NEW YORK/WASHINGTON

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has considered the idea of serving as Hillary Clinton's running mate but sees obstacles to that choice as she prepares to endorse the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, several people familiar with Warren's thinking told Reuters.While her thinking could evolve, Warren has concerns about joining a Clinton ticket, including the question of whether running two women would give the Democrats the best shot at defeating Republican Donald Trump, one source said.      Advisers to Warren, a fiery critic of Wall Street and a  popular figure among progressive Democrats, have been in close contact with Clinton's campaign team and the conversations have increased in frequency in recent weeks, the sources said. Warren has signaled to people close to her that she is intrigued by the possibility of being Clinton's No. 2 but has not discussed the role with Clinton, 68, or anyone else from her campaign, the people said. Warren, 66, has been one of the Democrats' most outspoken critics of Trump, 69, and her priority is helping to defeat the presumptive Republican nominee in the Nov. 8 presidential election, the sources said. Warren is also committed to advancing her own political agenda, which they described as ""more progressive"" than Clinton's more centrist positions. Warren fears that as vice president, or in a cabinet position, her voice could be less heard than it is in the U.S. Senate on her priority issues such as addressing income inequality, the sources said.  In the past, Warren has accused Clinton of abandoning her support for stronger bankruptcy legislation to try to appease Wall Street. 
'GET READY DONALD' 
An endorsement of Clinton could come within a week or two, one of the sources said. Clinton has been appealing for Democratic Party unity. On Twitter over the weekend, Warren echoed that call and emphasized the importance of the party coming together to beat Trump.""Get ready, Donald,"" Warren tweeted. ""We're coming.""
Warren, who represents Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate,   has stayed neutral in the Democratic primary race, notably remaining the only woman senator not throwing her support behind the first woman presidential nominee of a major U.S. political party.Were she to join the Clinton ticket, she could help energize progressives and win over supporters of Clinton's rival Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist U.S. senator from Vermont. Sanders' calls for reining in Wall Street and breaking up big banks dovetail with Warren's views.An ongoing feud with Trump gained steam on social media with a series of posts in which she labeled the celebrity businessman racist, sexist and xenophobic and said she was going to fight to make sure his ""toxic stew of hatred and insecurity never reaches the White House.""
Warren joined Clinton late last month in criticizing Trump for rooting for the 2008 financial crisis and delivered a 10-minute invective on the subject at an annual Washington gala two weeks ago.""What kind of a man roots for people to get thrown out of their house? I'll tell you exactly what kind of man does that,"" Warren said. ""It is a man who cares about no one but himself - a small insecure money-grubber who doesn't care who gets hurt so long as he makes a profit off it.""Trump has ridiculed Warren by calling her Pocahontas in a mocking reference to her having said in the past that she had Native American ancestry. Pocahontas was a famous Native American in early colonial Virginia.Warren is due to speak to the American Constitution Society, a progressive legal group, on Thursday at a time when Democrats and some Republicans have criticized Trump's comments about Mexican-American Judge Gonzalo Curiel.

By John Whitesides and Amanda Becker
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Winning over Bernie Sanders supporters who flocked to his insurgent presidential campaign will be the first and possibly toughest order of business for Hillary Clinton after she became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee this week.Every time the Vermont senator mentioned Clinton's name at a rally in California on Thursday night, his supporters booed as if she was Donald Trump, the Republican businessman who will face off against Clinton in the Nov. 8 election.But Clinton is wasting no time in launching her charm offensive. She called Sanders on Tuesday night, and during a celebratory rally in Brooklyn she praised his candidacy, saying their ""vigorous debate"" during the nominating contest had been good for the Democratic Party. Democrats in both camps said they expect to see more specific olive branches offered to Sanders in the weeks ahead, including compromises on the issues platform to be adopted at the party's July nominating convention and reforms in a Democratic primary process that Sanders criticized as rigged to favor the establishment.It may not be an easy sell for all of Sander's supporters, who have helped catapult him from political obscurity into the national spotlight, cheering his message on income inequality, campaign finance reform and Wall Street excesses. Given little chance a year ago, Sanders earned nearly 10 million votes and won more than 20 states during the nominating process.A Reuters/Ipsos poll in May found Sanders supporters have become increasingly resistant to Clinton in the past few months, with less than half saying they will vote for her if she becomes the party's nominee.Last month, 41 percent of Sanders' supporters said they would vote for Clinton over Trump in the general election. But that was down from 50 percent in April, and 52 percent in March.And some groups supporting Sanders plan to ramp up the pressure on superdelegates, prominent party officials who can vote for any candidate, in the last few weeks before Clinton's nomination becomes official at the party convention in Philadelphia. 
The people behind the Occupy DNC Convention Facebook group, with around 25,000 members, are creating their own web-based app to contact superdelegates, planning daily emails to urge them to switch to Sanders.CLINTON'S TRUMP CARD 
Clinton moved to the left to fend off Sanders during the primary battle, opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Asian trade pact, and the Keystone oil pipeline from Canada, voicing support for a higher minimum wage and backing Sanders' general goals of reining in Wall Street and reducing income inequality.Her best move now to win over progressive voters who backed Sanders would be showing she will stand behind those positions.
""One of the biggest points of skepticism that we hear from Sanders supporters and even lukewarm Clinton supporters is the question of whether she really meant the stuff she said in the primary,"" said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.""The next two weeks are a golden opportunity to make the answer apparent,"" he said, citing her pledges to seek criminal sentences for financial fraud, break up banks that pose economic risks and expand Social Security benefits.Several Democrats said Trump may prove to be the chief motivator for Sanders supporters to switch to Clinton.""Trump has done more than anyone to push the Sanders people toward Clinton for the general election,"" said Brad Anderson, an Iowa-based Democratic strategist who supported Clinton in the primary and said he has seen signs of a shift in the last few weeks.
Clinton could make specific concessions or overtures to assuage Sanders, particularly by eliminating the superdelegates from the primary process. Sanders has complained about the involvement of superdelegates, who have heavily backed Clinton.Another easy way to get Sanders' most passionate supporters on board is to simply hire them, says Democratic strategist Steve Schale.That's what Schale, a Florida-based staffer for President Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, did once the bitter primary fight between Obama and Clinton ended that year. Florida was crucial to Obama's prospects -- and his campaign need a large operation to work on voter registration, persuasion, and turnout.Clinton could offer Sanders diehards a similar opportunity to stay involved. ""For a lot of these folks, the campaign is as much as social calling as it is a movement,"" he said.While there were concerns in 2008 that Clinton's supporters would be too disaffected to support Obama, Clinton endorsed him less than a month after the primary ended and unified the party.Democratic party leaders may also help ease tensions. Sanders will meet on Thursday with Obama and Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada.

By Karen Brooks

A federal judge in Alabama has issued a permanent injunction barring state officials from denying same-sex couples the right to marry in that state, according to court documents made public on Wednesday. The order, filed on Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Callie Granade, came in response to a 2014 lawsuit challenging Alabama's ban on same-sex marriage, finalizing a decision Granade made in early 2015 that the state law was unconstitutional. The legality of gay marriage was at the center of a national debate until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2015 that the U.S. Constitution provided same-sex couples the right to marry.Despite that order, Alabama officials continued to resist the change in the law. Last month, Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore was suspended for issuing an administrative order to state probate judges that they should not issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.
In March, the Alabama Supreme Court dismissed petitions by opponents of same-sex marriage asking to reinstate the ban on those unions but refused to vacate or withdraw its own March 2015 ruling in favor of the same-sex marriage ban, made just months before the U.S. Supreme Court ruling.""This brings a finality by permanently prohibiting Alabama from enforcing its marriage laws which are discriminating against gay couples,"" said Susan Watson, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama. ""Given Alabama's fierce resistance, this permanent relief was required to ensure marriage equality in the state.""
Officials from the office of Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange, who is named in the lawsuit, could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. Strange's attorneys had asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed because the state was currently complying with the federal law. But Granade said in her ruling that ""promising to sin no more"" did not render a permanent injunction unnecessary. The actions of the suspended chief justice and other officials suggested that other attempts may be made to undermine the constitutional right of same-sex couples to marry, she wrote.
""It cannot be said with assurance that there is no reasonable expectation that Alabama's unconstitutional marriage laws will not again be enforced,"" the order said. (Reporting by Karen Brooks in Fort Worth, Texas; Editing by Peter Cooney)"	['Moore']	['gay']

Three teenagers were arrested on Wednesday and accused of three separate assaults during a demonstration that turned violent outside a rally for presidential candidate Donald Trump last week in San Jose, California, police said. The three unidentified juveniles, all males, were accused of taking part in a number of skirmishes between Trump supporters and anti-Trump demonstrators last Thursday outside the San Jose Convention Center. Trump held a rally there in the lead-up to Tuesday's California primary for the Republican party's presidential nomination.Two of the teenagers, aged 16 and 17, face charges of felony assault with a deadly weapon. The third, also 16, faces a misdemeanor battery charge, the San Jose Police Department said in a statement.One of the teenagers is accused of using a blunt object to strike a victim from behind. The victim suffered visible injuries, according to police. 
Four others were arrested during the protests last week. Two 19-year-olds and an 18-year-old face charges of felony assault with a deadly weapon, while another 19-year-old faces a misdemeanor charge of refusal to disperse. It is unclear whether the seven charged were Trump supporters or among the hundreds of protesters who were seen on news clips waving Mexican flags, chanting anti-Trump slogans, and burning Trump hats and at least one U.S. flag. 
Protesters, many angry over Trump's comments against illegal immigration, have gathered at his rallies for months.
Trump, now the Republican Party's presumptive nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, canceled a rally in Chicago in March after clashes broke out between his supporters and protesters. (Reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee; Editing by Paul Tait)"	['Paul', 'Trump']	[]

| SACRAMENTO, Calif.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. Political consultants are sometimes accused of hiding the naked truth about the candidates they represent or the campaigns they devise.But California voting expert Paul Mitchell bared it all after Tuesday's primary election, running naked around the grounds of the state Capitol building in Sacramento after his prediction in a key race turned out to be wrong.""When improbable things happen, some pay consequences,"" Mitchell posted on Twitter early on Wednesday morning. Along with the posting was a photo of the darkened Capitol, a map of a running route from the athletic tracking app Strava and the title, ""Streaking.""Last year, Mitchell firmly dismissed predictions that two Democrats would be chosen in Tuesday's primary to vie for the state's open U.S. Senate seat in November.
He was so sure that would not happen - despite a change in the state's open primary law advancing the top two vote-getters to the general election regardless of party affiliation - that he vowed to run naked around the Capitol if two Democrats were chosen. When it became clear on Tuesday night that state Attorney General Kamala Harris and U.S. Representative Loretta Sanchez, both Democrats, topped the polls and would advance to the general election, Mitchell knew what he had to do.
He parked his car in front of the Capitol building in downtown Sacramento in the darkest spot he could find, took off his clothes (including shoes) and ran, he said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.    ""I couldn't put up with all the badgering I would get if I didn't do it,"" he said. ""There's honor among politicos, I guess.""
He managed to maintain his privacy to all but a couple of youths on skateboards.""It really doesn't seem like it's very dark outside when you're streaking,"" Mitchell said. (Reporting by Sharon Bernstein; Editing by Peter Cooney)"	['Paul', 'Harris']	[]

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan unveiled a national security policy featuring stronger defense on Thursday, the next step in a conservative policy agenda rolling out as he works to unify Republicans after a divisive primary campaign.The plan is sharply critical of President Barack Obama, blaming the Democrat for ""eight years of broken promises, concessions, and retreat"" in the Syrian civil war, nuclear deal with Iran, chilly relations with Russia and dealings with a bellicose North Korea.It would overturn some of what Obama allies consider his foreign policy achievements, including the Iran deal and his moves toward normal relations with Communist-ruled Cuba. And it criticizes efforts to close the Guantanamo detention center.While not providing figures, it also calls for an end to military rollbacks and demands ""adequate, predictable budgets.""The blueprint includes several departures from foreign policy statements by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, whom Ryan has endorsed in the White House race.
It does not demand the erection of a massive wall along the Mexican border, a centerpiece of Trump's campaigning. Ryan calls for border security measures including ""high fencing,"" aerial surveillance and radar.But it echoes some of Trump's concerns about Muslim immigrants, with calls to tighten refugee screening and discussion of ways not to radicalize youths. Trump sparked outrage by promising to temporarily ban Muslims from the United States.""We must constantly reassess our defenses in order to find and close security gaps so that Islamist militants cannot slip into our country undetected,"" Ryan's plan said.
The plan is not isolationist. It takes a strong line on battling militants abroad, saying the United States must keep all options on the table and ""eliminate terrorist sanctuaries."" Trump has been critical of some U.S. alliances. Ryan's plan, in contrast, underscores the importance of NATO, calls ties to Israel ""the cornerstone of stability in the Middle East,"" advocates severe sanctions on Iran and says the United States should stand up to Russian aggression while bolstering Ukraine.
It also calls for more trade agreements and says foreign aid programs should make recipient countries self-sufficient.The plan calls for increased security for diplomats and facilities overseas. In that context, it mentions the 2012 attacks on Benghazi, which many Republicans cite to criticize then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Trump's rival in the White House race.Ryan, the country's highest-ranking elected Republican, has described the agenda as a way to offer voters a coherent policy message for 2017. He unveiled an anti-poverty agenda on Monday. Initiatives on regulation, constitutional authority, healthcare and tax reform are expected in the coming weeks.

By Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Legislation helping Puerto Rico dig out of its $70 billion debt crisis is set for a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday after a House panel fended off attempts to open the bill to a series of controversial amendments.By voice vote on Wednesday, the Rules Committee, the gatekeeper for bills moving through the House, sent the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) to the full House for debate and a likely vote on Thursday.The legislation, the result of months of negotiations between Congress and the Obama administration, would create a federal oversight board to work with investors to determine how much they would recover of the island territory's $70 billion in loans.Republicans have stressed that no taxpayer money would be used to bail out Puerto Rico from a crisis that has left nearly half of the population in poverty amid closings of schools and hospitals and a contracting economy.During a Rules panel debate that stretched into the night, the committee rejected pleas to allow amendments that would have changed the basic structure of the legislation and the operation of the oversight board.If the bill passes the House, action would move to the Senate, where some leading Democrats have said they would seek significant changes.
Earlier on Wednesday, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop, who ushered the bill through his committee on May 25, told reporters he expected the full House to pass it on Thursday.Bishop, a Utah Republican, said a strong vote for passage in the House would help propel it through the Senate.""The bottom line is the better the vote here (in the House), the less likely it's going to come back in a significantly altered form"" from the Senate, Bishop said.
Supporters hope to get it enacted into law before July 1, when Puerto Rico faces a deadline for making a $1.9 billion debt payment that it might not be able to fulfill.The House Rules Committee voted to allow debate on a limited number of amendments, including one giving priority to protecting federal taxpayer investments in Puerto Rico, such as mass transportation assets.Another amendment expected to be debated would expand a federal program aimed at encouraging economic development in Puerto Rico's ""under-utilized"" business zones.
Representative Raul Grijalva, a senior Democrat who worked on the bill, said Puerto Rico's debt crisis, if unaddressed, could grow into a humanitarian crisis. Stabilization measures contained in the bill, he said, ""would be the first step toward getting the situation under control.""But his fellow Democrat, Puerto Rican-born Representative Luis Gutierrez, warned, ""I don't think many of my colleagues in this body appreciate just how deeply offensive the bill before us is regarded in Puerto Rico.""He was particularly concerned with the way control board members would be chosen, with most not having to have any ties to the island.But Gutierrez failed to convince the committee to allow amendments to be offered making changes to the board and its operations.

By Roberta Rampton
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK President Barack Obama said on Wednesday he hoped that divisions between Democrats would start to heal in coming weeks, now that his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, has clinched the party's nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election.""My hope is that over the next couple of weeks we're able to pull things together,"" Obama said in his first public remarks since primary election wins on Tuesday in California and elsewhere propelled Clinton to victory over rival Bernie Sanders after a hard-fought, months-long campaign.   ""What happens during primaries is you get a little ouchy,"" Obama told NBC late-night host Jimmy Fallon during a taping of ""The Tonight Show"" set to air on Thursday.Sanders, who has not conceded the race, is set to meet with Obama at the White House on Thursday at 11:15 a.m. (1515 GMT).Later, at a fundraiser in the Central Park West apartment of Kenneth Lerer, a venture capitalist and chairman of the BuzzFeed medial company, Obama said he was ""not too worried"" about ""bruised feelings"" left over from the primary.
""We just ended - sort of ended - our primary season,"" Obama said, catching his mistake as the crowd of about 60 Democratic donors, who paid up to $33,400 to attend, laughed nervously.""I am concerned about us doing the hard nuts-and-bolts work of turning out people to vote, particularly young people, particularly low-income people,"" Obama said.Asked whether Obama thought Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, should quickly end his campaign, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the senator had ""more than earned the right to make his own decision about the course of his campaign.""
The party will officially vote on Clinton's nomination at its convention in Philadelphia at the end of July.Obama told Fallon that ""it was a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to have a contested primary"" and praised Sanders for the ""enormous energy and new ideas"" he brought to the campaign.
""He pushed the party and challenged them. I thought it made Hillary a better candidate,"" Obama said.The White House has said Obama, who is very popular among Democrats, will play a unifying role on the campaign trail.""The main role I'm going to be playing in this process is to remind the American people that this is a serious job. This is not reality TV,"" Obama told Fallon in a swipe at presumptive Republican nominee and real estate magnate Donald Trump, who starred in a reality television show.

By Edward Krudy and Gina Cherelus
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Corruption charges against a union leader and a financier stemming from state and federal investigations that include an examination of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's campaign fundraising practices are casting a cloud over his office and could possibly complicate his re-election bid.The arrests on Wednesday of the head of New York City's prison guard union and a hedge fund financier accused of orchestrating a bribery scheme involving union retirement and operating funds were the first to emerge from the probes.Although the charges were not linked to de Blasio, who won a landslide victory in 2013, the case is the first major prosecution to emerge from several overlapping state and federal corruption probes examining de Blasio's fundraising practices, among other avenues of inquiry. David Birdsell, dean of the Baruch College School of Public Affairs, said on Wednesday the investigations were ""keeping him off message,"" noting that de Blasio was on occasion having to avoid the press because of incessant questions.On Wednesday his office said the investigations were not distracting the mayor.""New Yorkers will vote for the candidate who gets things done for their families and communities,"" said Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for de Blasio. ""That person is Mayor de Blasio.""Still, there is evidence that the investigations are affecting the mayor's standing, Birdsell said. If they drag on and raise more questions they will not only be a distraction for the mayor but possibly encourage a challenge from his own party. 
""Right now people smell some blood in the water,"" Birdsell said.He said if the mayor becomes directly implicated in the investigations it would turn a contested Democratic primary mayoral race next year into a certainty from a likelihood.On Wednesday at a public appearance, de Blasio reiterated that he was ""absolutely comfortable that we have done things properly."" He has said his administration committed no wrongdoing and is cooperating fully with investigators.In April, de Blasio's office received subpoenas from state and federal prosecutors pursuing coordinated corruption probes that extended from City Hall to the police department.News of the subpoenas came days after a leaked January report from the state Board of Elections accusing the mayor and others of intentionally evading campaign finance contribution limits in 2014.
The mayor's counsel said at the time de Blasio had not been personally served.OFF MESSAGE, RATINGS FALL  
The once popular de Blasio, who struck a cord with New Yorkers after 12 years of Michael Bloomberg's mayoralty, has seen his approval rating fall to a new low in May, according to a Quinnipiac University poll. 
De Blasio will be up for re-election in 2017.The latest poll, conducted in the first week of June among 600 likely Democratic mayoral primary voters and published on Wednesday, showed 38 percent believed de Blasio deserved reelection while 43 percent said he did not.  The poll was conducted by NYC Deserves Better, a group formed by Bradley Tusk, a businessman and former campaign manager for Michael Bloomberg who wants a new mayor to be elected. The poll found that in a potential match up, de Blasio was neck-and-neck with City Comptroller Scott Stringer.   However, the poll also found that 51 percent had a 'very positive' or 'somewhat positive' opinion of the mayor, and 32 percent had a 'somewhat negative' or 'very negative' opinion.De Blasio brushed off questions about the poll and said he was committed to focusing on the job. ""Polls come and go. They go up. They go down. They don't always reflect what happens in elections,"" he said. ""I believe fundamentally that the goal is to do the work, do it well (Editing by Bernard Orr)"	[]	[]

Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich on Wednesday signed a bill legalizing marijuana use for medical purposes under certain circumstances, his office said.Over the last few years, state legislatures and voters in the United States have been much more receptive to making marijuana legal for medical purposes, and to a lesser extent, recreational use.The Ohio legislature approved the measure in May.Some 24 states and Washington D.C. currently allow some type of medical marijuana use, and just a handful of states allow its recreational use. It remains illegal on the federal level.
Kasich, who earlier this year dropped out of the U.S. presidential race, signed the bill but provided no statement on Wednesday. The Ohio legislation only allows patients with specific medical conditions to use an oil, edible, tincture or vapor form of marijuana prescribed by a physician licensed in the state, starting in 2017.
Medical marijuana users would not be allowed to smoke or grow their own marijuana under the measure, which also would create a commission responsible for regulating and licensing of all operations of the drug.The measure was fast-tracked to head off a possible less-restrictive medical marijuana ballot initiative in November. Ohioans for Medical Marijuana suspended their campaign for the ballot measure late last month, saying that while the lawmakers' bill had its shortcomings, it was ""a moderately good piece of legislation.""
Last November, Ohio voters soundly rejected a measure that would have made it the first U.S. Midwestern state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. The proposal was criticized for allowing the main backers of the proposal cartel-like powers over the industry in the state for several years.
