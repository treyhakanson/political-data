By Arshad Mohammed and Jonathan Landay
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama and his top foreign policy advisers are expected to meet on Friday to consider their military and other options in Syria as Syrian and Russian aircraft continue to pummel Aleppo and other targets, U.S. officials said.Some top officials argue the United States must act more forcefully in Syria or risk losing what influence it still has over moderate rebels and its Arab, Kurdish and Turkish allies in the fight against Islamic State, the officials told Reuters.One set of options includes direct U.S. military action such as air strikes on Syrian military bases, munitions depots or radar and anti-aircraft bases, said one official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.This official said one danger of such action is that Russian and Syrian forces are often co-mingled, raising the possibility of a direct confrontation with Russia that Obama has been at pains to avoid.U.S. officials said they consider it unlikely that Obama will order U.S. air strikes on Syrian government targets, and they stressed that he may not make any decisions at the planned meeting of his National Security Council.    One alternative, U.S. officials said, is allowing allies to provide U.S.-vetted rebels with more sophisticated weapons, although not shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, which Washington fears could be used against Western airliners.The White House declined to comment.Friday's planned meeting is the latest in a long series of internal debates about what, if anything, to do to end a 5-1/2 year civil war that has killed at least 300,000 people and displaced half the country's population.
The ultimate aim of any new action could be to bolster the battered moderate rebels so they can weather what is now widely seen as the inevitable fall of rebel-held eastern Aleppo to the forces of Russian- and Iranian-backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.It also might temper a sense of betrayal among moderate rebels who feel Obama encouraged their uprising by calling for Assad to go but then abandoned them, failing even to enforce his own ""red line"" against Syria's use of chemical weapons.This, in turn, might deter them from migrating to Islamist groups such as the Nusra Front, which the United States regards as Syria's al Qaeda branch. The group in July said it had cut ties to al Qaeda and changed its name to Jabhat Fatah al-Sham. ANOTHER TRY AT DIPLOMACYThe U.S. and Russian foreign ministers will meet in Lausanne, Switzerland on Saturday to resume their failed effort to find a diplomatic solution, possibly joined by their counterparts from Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Iran, but U.S. officials voiced little hope for success.
Friday's planned meeting at the White House and the session in Lausanne occur as Obama, with just 100 days left in office, faces other decisions about whether to deepen U.S. military involvement in the Middle East -- notably in Yemen and Iraq -- a stance he opposed when he won the White House in 2008.Earlier Thursday the United States launched cruise missiles  at three coastal radar sites in areas of Yemen controlled by Iran-aligned Houthi forces, retaliating after failed missile attacks this week on a U.S. Navy destroyer, U.S. officials said.In Iraq, U.S. officials are debating whether government forces will need more U.S. support both during and after their campaign to retake Mosul, Islamic State's de facto capital in the country. Some officials argue the Iraqis now cannot retake the city without significant help from Kurdish peshmerga forces, as well as Sunni and Shi'ite militias, and that their participation could trigger religious and ethnic conflict in the city.         
In Syria, Washington has turned to the question of whether to take military action after its latest effort to broker a truce with Russia collapsed last month.The United States has called for Assad to step down, but for years has seemed resigned to his remaining in control of parts of the country as it prosecutes a separate fight against Islamic State militants in Syria and in Iraq.The U.S. policy is to target Islamic State first, a decision that has opened it to charges that it is doing nothing to prevent the humanitarian catastrophe in Syria and particularly in Aleppo, Syria's largest city.Renewed bombing of rebel-held eastern Aleppo has killed more than 150 people this week, rescue workers said, as Syria intensifies its Russian-backed offensive to take the whole city.Anthony Cordesman of Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank suggested the United States' failure to act earlier in Syria, and in Aleppo in particular, had narrowed Obama's options.""There is only so long you can ignore your options before you don't have any,"" Cordesman said.

By Ayesha Rascoe
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The Obama administration, in its final weeks, plans to ease the legal obligations on prisoners to pay for child support while they are locked up, targeting practices that critics say can saddle ex-convicts with crippling debts.The regulatory changes, if put in place, would give President Barack Obama something more to show for his efforts to reform the U.S. criminal justice system, a legacy issue for the Democrat whose time in office ends on Jan. 20.As the first black president of a nation that incarcerates a disproportionately large number of black and Latino men, Obama has made it a priority to address problems that make it difficult for released inmates to reenter society.A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the new rules are not final, expressed confidence they would be completed before Obama leaves office.The rules would require that prisoners be allowed to lower the amount of child support they pay in prison, with the goal of preventing large debts that inmates struggle to repay after release and that can lead to reincarceration.Some Republican critics have said such a change would let parents flout their financial responsibilities. Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan last year introduced a bill to block the administration from making such a change. The bill did not become law.A Republican House aide told Reuters the administration's initiative would amount to a ""backdoor effort"" to avoid the legislative process.Criminal justice reform was supposed to be an area where Republicans and Democrats could find common ground in 2016, but legislative efforts have stalled.As a result, the administration needs to move forward on its own where it can, the White House official said.
""We are always happy to sit down and talk with Congress, but at some point we have to move forward with what we know we are legally permitted to do and what is right,"" the official said.DEBTS PILE UP
Child-support programs require absent parents to send money, usually to the spouse who has custody, to help raise their children. For prisoners who have little or no income, regular child-support payments can accumulate into unmanageable debts.
Just ask Glenn Martin. As a young father, he went to prison for six years for armed robbery. While in prison, his child support payments were increased to $400 a month from $50 a month, even though he only earned about $40 a month.     When he was released, Martin told Reuters he faced a $50,000 civil judgment for back child support, including interest. He said he tried to get that changed, but judges said state law did not permit modifications for incarceration.Martin went on to found a prison reform group, JustLeadershipUSA. ""We have two decades of evidence that says that being tough just hasn't worked,"" he said.""What it has done is further criminalize the people we should be trying to move into the labor market.""Most states have changed their laws so that child support payments for prisoners can be modified, but 14 states still do not allow it or place major obstacles in the way.
The Obama administration issued draft regulations in late 2014 that would require states to allow prisoners to modify their child support court orders, while also requiring state courts to set orders based on prisoners' ""actual"" income.States run their own child support enforcement programs, but Washington sets nationwide standards and reimburses states for 66 percent of expenditures on the programs and provides incentive payments to states based on meeting certain targets.   The final version of the draft rules, still not public, was sent to the White House for review in July.Supporters say the changes will help reduce prison populations by preventing ex-convicts from accruing debts that make it difficult for them to find legitimate jobs and increases the likelihood they could face jail time over unpaid child support payments.A 2010 administration survey found 51,000 federal prisoners had child support orders, with almost 29,000 of the prisoners behind on payments. The average amount owed was nearly $24,000.""The child support system as it exists today in a lot of ways has become ... a major driver of mass incarceration,"" said Rebecca Vallas, managing director of the Poverty to Prosperity program at the Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank.

By David Brunnstrom
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The death of Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej on Thursday  adds a new layer of uncertainty to U.S. President Barack Obama's faltering ""pivot"" to Asia less than a month before the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential elections.The king was important in cementing the long-standing alliance between the United States and Thailand after World War Two, in a reign that spanned the Vietnam War and development of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which Washington still considers vital to maintaining its influence in the region.King Bhumibol's death coincides with faltering momentum in   Obama's signature policy of rebalancing the U.S. diplomatic and security focus to the Asia-Pacific region in the face of China's rapid rise.The main economic pillar of the rebalance, the 12-nation  Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, is languishing in the U.S. Congress with no guarantee that Obama will be able to push it through before leaving the presidency to Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, both of whom say they oppose the deal.Clinton, as secretary of state under fellow-Democrat Obama from 2009-13, was one of the architects of the policy but Republican Trump has questioned the extent to which he would maintain the U.S. security commitment to East Asia.Obama's efforts to boost security ties with Southeast Asia have come in response to China's pursuit of territorial claims in the South China Sea, a vital strategic waterway.However, a torrent of anti-American rhetoric from new Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has cast doubt on the U.S.  military relationship with Manila just months after Washington reached an agreement on rotating access to bases in the country.Other Southeast Asian countries, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, are focused on internal political issues and are avoiding playing any leadership role in ASEAN, while even traditionally reliable regional ally Australia is treading carefully to avoid jeopardizing its economic ties with Beijing.Thailand was already occupying a back seat in regional affairs following a 2014 military coup seen as a means to maintain stability during the king's long illness. Thailand is expected to turn further inward during a prolonged mourning period and potentially politically fragile royal succession.King Bhumibol's son, Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, who is expected to become Thailand's new king, lacks the strong connection to the United States of his father, who was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Obama offered condolences to the Thai people and the King's family, calling King Bhumibol ""a tireless champion of his country's development.""
Obama's former top Asia adviser, Evan Medeiros, now at the Eurasia Group, said the mourning process would likely slow a return to democratic government and Prince Vajiralongkorn was a source of ""profound uncertainty."" ""He's such an unknown, unpredictable figure,"" he said.U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States and Thailand had been close friends for two centuries.""Our friendship and our partnership have weathered many challenges ... we expect it to continue to grow stronger,"" Toner told a regular news briefing.While the United States backed a return to democracy, Toner said it would be ""premature... to lay our expectations for the near term"" as Thailand mourned.
MUCH HAS CHANGED
While Washington condemned the 2014 coup, it has kept  security ties with Bangkok, particularly through annual military exercises called Cobra Gold.""The fact that we have been able to remain closely tethered and stayed largely on track with Cobra Gold and other cooperative efforts, notwithstanding the military takeover ... is testament to the strong roots we have put down and the work that we're doing,"" the senior U.S. diplomat for Asia, Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel, said on Wednesday.Murray Hiebert of Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said much had changed since Obama announced his pivot policy in 2011.""The king's death adds to uncertainty in Southeast Asia, a region in considerable flux already. This makes the U.S. rebalance to Asia more difficult because the situation in so many countries is that of 'wait and see.' ""When the pivot started, you had Thailand engaged, a new leader in Malaysia who wanted to engage, you had Aquino coming in the Philippines and very forward-leaning internationally and very open to the U.S.; you had an internationalist president in Indonesia. It was a rather different dynamic.""
King Bhumibol's death means Washington finds itself having to rely even more on former foe Vietnam for any kind of strategic ballast in the region.""The Vietnamese are providing the dynamism when it comes to strategic thinking,"" U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Ted Osius said in Washington on Tuesday. ""Indonesia is very internally focused right now ... Thailand is very internally focused, and Malaysia has a rolling political crisis,"" he continued.""I don't know exactly what direction the Philippines is headed; Singapore has a lot of strategic thinkers but it's a city state; I don't think you can really count on Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar to provide the strategic engine for ASEAN.""There appears little prospect for now, however, that Vietnam would be willing to open its doors further to the U.S. military should the deal with the Philippines run into problems, given past animosities and concerns about China.""I do not expect the Vietnamese calculation to be, 'Oh, the Philippines is doing whatever it's doing, let's race full steam ahead with the United States.' No, that's not about to happen,"" Osius said. ""The Vietnamese have been very measured in the pace at which they have expanded the security relationship.""Hiebert said Asian countries remain keen on the U.S. pivot, given their worries about China, but the pace was likely to flag further, presenting a tougher task to revive the initiative once Obama leaves power.""I wouldn't declare the pivot dead ... I think there's still quite a bit of interest in the U.S., but some of the sort of dynamism that we saw earlier about building the region is a little bit diminished right now,"" he said.

By Alastair Sharp
| TORONTO

TORONTO U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump can be pursued for some claims made by investors in a hybrid hotel-condo tower in Toronto bearing his name, according to a Canadian court ruling released on Thursday.An Ontario appeals court reversed an earlier decision to throw out a case brought against Trump and associates by the investors, who said they were misled into investing in the development in Toronto's financial district.The investors bought units in the tower that were then placed into a pool of rooms to be rented out at luxury rates by the hotel's operator.""There would be no factual or legal basis to hold my client liable, principally because my client did not enter into a contract with any of the buyers, did not sell anything to any of the buyers, and did not receive any money from any of the buyers,"" said Alan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization.A lawyer representing all the defendants, Symon Zucker, said he was still reviewing the judgment to determine the merits of an appeal, but said he was pleased it contained no adverse findings against either Trump or his associate.""As to the balance of the claim, should it be pursued, we believe that it has no chance of being successful,"" he said. 
The 65-story property is managed by the Trump Organization.Lawyers for Trump and two others had argued that no misrepresentations had been made or that in any event they should not attract personal liability.Trump won a victory last year when a lower court absolved the real estate businessman of any personal responsibility, as his company had only licensed the Trump name to Talon International Development Inc, which owns the property.
In the Court of Appeal for Ontario ruling published on Thursday, Justice Paul Rouleau dismissed claims against Trump and two associates for misrepresentation and breach of a ruling by a securities regulator.However, the judge said it was unfair for the original ruling to dismiss claims ""based on oppression, collusion, or breach of fiduciary duties,"" and said these can still be heard in court.Trump ""is still a defendant in this action...and he can still be held liable to these people for damages,"" said Mitchell Wine, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. 
    ""This court said you're still very much part of this thing, and you still have to answer to all of these allegations other than the two that the court considered in this decision.""The ruling also said Talon must pay damages to one buyer for ""negligent misrepresentation"" and another sale must be rescinded.The case is: Singh v.

By Valerie Volcovici
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A conservative nonprofit group that lobbies Republicans to support clean energy policy will spend more than $1 million over the next few weeks to back 10 members of Congress running in the Nov. 8 elections, hoping to attract key swing voters such as millennials.  Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions (CRES) is backing Republican House and Senate candidates who favor clean energy, even as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump mocks wind energy and calls climate change a hoax.Embracing a clean energy agenda can help Republicans win in close races by attracting key voters like millennials and women, and help broaden the Republican base, James Dozier, CRES executive director, told Reuters.""The way I look at it is regardless of who is in the Oval Office, we need clean energy champions on the Hill,"" said Dozier, who added that Republicans have ceded the issue to Democrats.""This is a ripe opportunity to reframe Republicans' engagement in energy debate,"" said Dozier. ""We see this as an issue the party can use to grow the tent with the next generation of voters, with female voters and Hispanics and African Americans.""
CRES kicked off its fall spending campaign last week with more than $200,000 in radio ad buys for Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski and North Carolina Senator Richard Burr, who faces a close re-election race against challenger Deborah Ross. The group will spend an additional $900,000 in support of other Republican candidates, including New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte, who is neck-in-neck with Democratic Governor Maggie Hassan in her re-election bid, and Representative Joe Heck, who is running in the hotly contested race for the open Nevada Senate seat against Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto.On the House side, CRES will spend money for ads and voter turnout efforts for representatives from Illinois, Virginia, Florida and New York.
CRES is not alone in backing Republicans who can help the party embrace clean energy policy and accept the science behind climate change.Jay Faison, a North Carolina-based businessman, launched the $2 million Clear Path Action Fund to launch digital media campaigns for candidates, including Ayotte, who support clean energy in key swing states.
But these Republican efforts are dwarfed by spending from environmental PACs that are spending record amounts to back Democrats.The League of Conservation Voters said it will spend a record $40 million this election cycle.Other groups, including green activist billionaire Tom Steyer's NextGen and the Natural Resources Defense Council Action fund, have also announced tens of millions of dollars more in spending.

By James Oliphant
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON With Donald Trump's U.S. election prospects dimming and controversy swirling around him, future Republican presidential hopefuls may be weighing whether standing by their man is the savvy move.Party strategists fear voters fleeing Trump will also fail to support Republican candidates for the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, possibly costing the party control of Congress.If Trump loses the Nov. 8 presidential election to Democrat Hillary Clinton, his polarizing candidacy may reverberate well past 2016, tarring future Republican White House hopefuls, potentially including House Speaker Paul Ryan, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio and Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Trump's vice presidential running mate.Trump was struggling in opinion polls before a 2005 video released last week showed him talking in sexually aggressive terms about seducing women. Afterward came stories in several news outlets alleging Trump had inappropriately touched women. Trump has angrily denounced the stories, the media and Republicans who have declined to support him.""The brand has already been irrevocably damaged. There's nothing we can do in the short term,"" said Doug Heye, a former top official with the Republican National Committee. Looking to the 2018 U.S. congressional election and the 2020 presidential election, Heye said: ""In two to four years, the stain on our party's soul won't be washed away.""To be sure, a Trump loss is no guarantee the Republicans would suffer for long. Four years after Barry Goldwater's massive loss in 1964, Richard Nixon staged a Republican comeback. The conservative Heritage Foundation think thank has said Goldwater launched a shift to the right that would end half a century of liberal dominance in American politics. DEFINING MOMENT
For Republicans weighing a run for president in four years, deciding whether to back Trump may be a defining moment equal to what politicians faced in 2002 when they decided whether to back Republican President George Bush's Iraq invasion. By 2006, public sentiment had turned harshly against the Iraq war, some Republican politicians lost their jobs, and Democrats seized both the House and Senate.
Republican presidential hopefuls of the future may be asking: How can I be loyal and stand by Trump while at the same time expand the party's base to include sectors the candidate has alienated? More broadly, they may ask: What's the right side of history?Trump's candidacy has attracted passionate support from a core group of voters but also driven away some moderates and independents. Republicans such as Heye fear Trump, who already has alienated large populations of Hispanic voters because of his hard line on immigration, will cost the party a generation of women voters as well.Ryan, Rubio and Pence all have, to some degree, sought to distance themselves from Trump. Ryan this week told colleagues he would no longer publicly defend Trump, in essence washing his hands of him. Rubio, who ran against Trump in the Republican primary and is fighting for re-election in his home state of Florida, has criticized Trump's remarks about women, but has not withdrawn his support.Pence is routinely forced to answer for his running mate's conduct, but managed at last week's vice presidential debate to outline policy differences with him.
If Trump leads the party to crushing defeat next month, he may for years haunt Republican office-holders who supported him.""I predict a chaotic round of finger pointing after the election, as people try to justify their position,"" said Jim Manley, a former top aide to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid who witnessed the Democratic wave in 2006 first-hand.Democrats are trying to link vulnerable Senate candidates to Trump at every turn. On Thursday, the advocacy group American Bridge highlighted Trump's praise of Rubio on local Florida television, even as Rubio has avoided appearing at any Trump events in the state. Clinton on Twitter this week noted that Ryan has not recanted his endorsement of Trump.'TOUGH' FOR PENCE

Strategists say Pence would have the hardest time emerging from Trump's shadow. ""I think for Pence, it's really tough,"" said Republican operative Liz Mair.Pence excited some conservative voters with his debate performance. A Politico/Morning Consult poll taken afterward showed him as the top choice for 2020 among Republicans, at 22 percent. Ryan, Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Rubio followed.Cruz, who was Trump's leading rival for the 2016 Republican nomination, illustrated the perils of trying to respond to Trump's candidacy. After holding out, Cruz endorsed Trump last month, just before the candidate went into a public-opinion tailspin.Cruz and Rubio, as well as Ryan, have come under fire from some Republicans for appearing to waver on Trump, at times standing by him and at other times criticizing him.""People that waffle are going to have more trouble than people who pick a side,"" said Brian Bartlett, a Republican strategist who worked for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign.He said Ohio Governor John Kasich, another presidential candidate who consistently refused to endorse Trump, may emerge in the strongest position of all. Other potential 2020 contenders, such as South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, may benefit from not being on the ballot this year, thus being spared from being asked constantly about Trump while campaigning.But that assumes the anti-Trump forces in the party hold sway after the election. There will still be a significant chunk of the party who will view Trump's critics as disloyal, Bartlett warned, which may put some establishment politicians on the spot to explain why they did not do more to support the nominee.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's provocative proposals on immigration, trade and other issues have drawn attention and verbal attacks - as well as some praise - well beyond the United States' shores. Here is a sampling.RUSSIA
Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have often praised each other. Last December, Putin described the New York businessman as ""a very flamboyant man, very talented."" Trump, who lauded Putin in return, also spoke well of him in September, saying at a televised forum with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton that Putin had been a better leader than Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama.MEXICO
Some of the strongest criticism of Trump from abroad has come from Mexican officials because of his verbal attacks on illegal Mexican immigrants and his promise to build a wall on the southern border and make Mexico pay for it. Following talks in Mexico City between Trump and Enrique Pena Nieto, the Mexican president said the American's policy stances ""could represent a huge threat to Mexico, and I am not prepared to keep my arms crossed and do nothing."" Earlier this year, he likened Trump to dictators Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.CHINA
In April, Chinese Finance Minister Lou Jiwei called Trump ""an irrational type"" because of the candidate's proposal that tariffs on imported Chinese goods be increased to up to 45 percent. ""If he were to do this, that would be in violation of the rules set by the World Trade Organization,"" Lou said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.
BRITAIN
Then-British Prime Minister David Cameron in May called Trump's initial proposal for a temporary ban on Muslim's entering the United States ""very dangerous."" In December, Cameron had called Trump, potentially the leader of Britain's closest ally, ""divisive, stupid and wrong"" for calling for the ban. Nigel Farage, a politician who played a key role in the successful campaign to get Britain out of the European Union, lent his support to Trump in August, appearing with the candidate at a rally in Jackson, Mississippi. Farage said Trump represented the same type of anti-establishment movement that he had masterminded in his own country.London's first Muslim mayor, Sadiq Khan, said in May that Trump had an ""ignorant view of Islam,"" referring to Trump's initial proposed ban on Muslims. {nL2N18709R] In September, during his first U.S. visit, Khan expressed support for Clinton.
FRANCE
French President Francois Hollande said in August that a Trump victory could make politics more conservative around the world and that the New York businessman made people ""feel nauseous."" A Trump win could also affect France's spring 2017 presidential election, said Hollande.GERMANY
Germany's European affairs minister, Michael Roth, said in August that Trump's assertion that Chancellor Angela Merkel's open-door refugee policy had resulted in a huge increase in crime was incorrect. Roth said it was important to correct campaign statements in other countries that were based on ""fears, lies and half-truths,"" given the importance of the U.S. election for the world.
In April, the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, criticized Trump's ""America First"" policy, which the candidate had unveiled in a speech that week. Steinmeier said world security could no longer be ensured unilaterally and that international conflicts could only be solved nowadays if heavyweights like the United States and Russia and others joined forces.JAPAN
The ""America First"" stance - which included a portrayal by Trump of longtime ally Japan as a free rider on security - also came in for a veiled swipe from Japan's ambassador to the United States, Kenichiro Sasae, in May. Without mentioning Trump by name, Sasae said he did not want to see an isolationist United States. ""I want to see the United States to be strong and come with a strong robust position, not really thinking of the United States only,"" he said.UNITED NATIONS
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein said on Wednesday that the world would be in danger if Trump became president. He cited Trump's views on vulnerable communities, including minorities, and his talk of authorizing torture in interrogations, banned under international law, as ""deeply unsettling and disturbing.""

7	7	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-donations-idUSKCN12D12V	Trump's missing donors: the people who work for him	"


By Michelle Conlin and Grant Smith
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Kerry Woolard, the 37-year-old manager of Trump Winery in Charlottesville, Virginia, went online in June and made her first political contribution: A $250 donation to the campaign of her boss, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.Woolard's donation was unusual.Only a dozen of an estimated 22,450 people employed at Trump's companies have donated more than $200 to the celebrity businessman's bid for the U.S. presidency, a Reuters review of federal campaign finance records through August shows. Those who gave less to either Trump's campaign or his joint fundraising committees would not have shown up in the review. The contributors, including an office cleaner, a golf course groundskeeper, a bartender and an attorney, have given $5,298 to Trump's campaign, a fraction of the $112 million Trump's political operation has received from donors and joint fundraisers.An employee at Trump enterprises gave $275 to the campaign of her employer's Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. A 13th Trump employee, a lawyer at the Trump Organization, contributed to a Trump Super PAC, giving $1,000.""Honestly, I wish I could do more,"" said Woolard, who addressed the Republican national convention in July and has attended private dinners with Trump, his wife Melania, and their son, Barron. ""He is an amazing boss, has been a great leader and I believe would do a great job for our country.""Trump has made his business record central to his campaign. He often speaks about the thousands of jobs he has created and portrays himself as a dealmaker who drove hard bargains and avoided paying taxes to benefit his company, his family and his employees. Those employees may vote for Trump on Nov. 8, and could be supporting his candidacy with smaller-dollar contributions that do not appear on the filings. But when it comes to putting more significant money toward Trump's candidacy, his workers have shown little inclination to support their boss.       That stands in stark contrast to the 2012 election, when Mitt Romney, also an affluent businessman, was the Republican nominee.Employees at the private equity firm Romney led and then retired from in 1999, Bain Capital, and a separate company for which he worked, Bain & Company, donated nearly $375,000 directly to his campaign and through joint fundraising committees during a comparable period in the election cycle, FEC records show. Bain Capital employees gave an additional $1.125 million to Romney's Super PAC.
Clinton received $324,000 directly to her campaign and through her joint fundraising committee from employees at the State Department, where she served as secretary of state from 2009 until 2013, according to FEC filings through August. No State Department employee has given so far to Clinton's Super PAC.A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, Hope Hicks, said in an emailed statement: ""Mr. Trump has self-funded the majority of his campaign so the comparison is not realistic."" A Trump Organization spokeswoman said: ""While The Trump Organization is not political, there has been tremendous excitement and support for Mr. Trump from his employees, those that know firsthand he is an incredible leader.""After vowing to self-fund his campaign - and spending $47 million of his own money to defeat his primary challengers - Trump changed course once he secured the Republican nomination. Of the $112 million he raised, 43 percent came from people who gave $200 or less directly to his campaign. A study published in September of companies on the Standard & Poor's 1,500 stock market index found that employees' political donations typically mirror those of their chief executive officers. 
The study, conducted by business and finance professors at Arizona State University, Bocconi University in Milan and the Swiss Finance Institute in Zurich, found workers donated almost three times more money to candidates supported by their CEOs. The influence of the chief executives was particularly pronounced at firms that explicitly advocate for political campaigns.A BETTER PLACE TO WORK 
Reuters cross-referenced Trump's federal financial disclosure records, which lists him as controlling more than 500 entities, including some based overseas, with FEC campaign finance data. The FEC requires that political campaigns disclose the identities, addresses and employers of anyone who contributes $200 or more to Super PACs, a campaign or a joint fundraising committee, which typically coordinates fundraising between a political campaign and the party's central organizing body.
The estimate of Trump's total employees, 22,450, comes from financial data intelligence provider PrivCo and includes some entities abroad. Federal election law stipulates that permanent residents and American citizens, including those working outside the United States, can donate to political campaigns. But foreign nationals working for Trump operations either in the United States or abroad cannot.Six of the 12 people who said they worked for Trump on campaign donation forms did not respond to multiple requests for comment on their home and business phones. Two had phone numbers that are not in service, according to a background search database. One confirmed his employment and donation before hanging up the phone. Another confirmed her donation but said she needed clearance from the Trump Organization to comment.   The only two who discussed their donations with Reuters were Woolard, the Trump Winery manager, and Fred Laderer, an 81-year-old employee at Trump National Golf Club in North Carolina.Laderer made two donations to Republican political entities, of which $56 was earmarked for the Trump campaign. Laderer, who schedules start times for golfers, said since Trump took over the North Carolina club ""it's a much better place to work. The members are much happier."" Still, he added that he didn't donate to Trump's campaign because he works for the candidate, but because ""Clinton would bring a lot of bad luggage.""

WASHINGTON The New York Times said on Thursday that it stands by its story about two women who say Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made inappropriate advances, and rebutted claims by a lawyer for Trump that the story is libelous.""Nothing in our article has had the slightest effect on the reputation that Mr. Trump, through his own words and actions, has already created for himself,"" David McCraw, vice president and assistant general counsel for the newspaper, said in a letter to Trump's lawyer.
If Trump disagrees that the story was libelous, ""we welcome the opportunity to have a court set him straight,"" McCraw said in the letter.
