It said Clinton's lead was up from 3 points in the previous day's poll but still ""within the range of sampling error.""

A state judge on Friday struck down a Kansas voter registration system that would have prevented people from voting in state and local elections unless they show proof of U.S. citizenship.The judge ruled that the loss of voting rights for more than 18,000 Kansas residents ""far outweighs"" the risk posed by potential voter fraud, as the state mentioned only about two dozen people who may have attempted to improperly register to vote over the last 13 years.""The right of citizen suffrage forms the foundation of a democratic society,"" Larry Hendricks, District Judge in Shawnee County, wrote in a 19-page ruling. ""Whenever the laws of a state and the federal government clash with respect to this right, cracks are bound to appear in the framework of democracy.""Kansas has had one of the strictest voter identification statutes in the United States, making the state a symbol for mostly Republican Party supporters who say the rules are meant to prevent voter fraud. Opponents, mostly Democrats, say the rules discriminate against minorities.Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach said by phone on Friday he planned to appeal the ruling adding, ""I regard the decision as wrong ... and this decision stands in the way of protecting our elections.""
The American Civil Liberties Union's lawsuit said the voter registration system established by Kobach violated the state's constitution and state law and called it ""two-tiered."" ""This ruling is a victory for Kansas voters and a stinging rebuke of Secretary Kobach's repeated efforts to improperly use his authority to obstruct their access to the ballot,"" ACLU Voting Rights Project staff attorney Sophia Lakin said in a statement.
The ACLU said the system would have denied the right to vote in state and local elections to residents who registered through a federal voter registration form or when they applied for or renewed their driver's license.Under the rejected system, those people could have voted in federal elections but would have had to show proof of citizenship to vote in state and local ones.
The system required registrants to prove their citizenship by providing one of a series of documents, including birth certificates and passports. Kobach has gained a reputation for pushing a series of voting and anti-immigration measures as a national debate over voting restrictions has accelerated since the Supreme Court struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act in 2013.

By Mark Hosenball
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The FBI and U.S. intelligence agencies are examining faked documents aimed at discrediting the Hillary Clinton campaign as part of a broader investigation into what U.S. officials believe has been an attempt by Russia to disrupt the presidential election, people with knowledge of the matter said.U.S. Senator Tom Carper, a Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, has referred one of the documents to the FBI for investigation on the grounds that his name and stationery were forged to appear authentic.In a document forged to appear as though Carper was writing a letter to Clinton, Carper is quoted as saying the Department of Homeland Security had advised him of a risk that a ""massive"" cyber attack ""could change the election results in favor of a specific candidate."" The document dated October 3 was reviewed by Reuters. You can see a copy of the letter here: tmsnrt.rs/2emt5AI.It concludes, ""Any suspicious incident will be immediately reported to your assistants so that a recount of votes could be timely organized. You will not lose the election because of some compromised electronic voting systems."" The fake Carper letter is one of several documents presented to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Department of Justice for review in recent weeks, the sources said.Carper spokeswoman Meghan Pennington confirmed on Friday that the senator had sent a copy of the letter to the FBI and the Senate's chief law enforcement officer.""Our office became aware of a fake letter on Senator Carper's official letterhead and immediately referred it to federal law enforcement to investigate its genesis,"" Pennington said.As part of an investigation into suspected Russian hacking, FBI investigators have also asked Democratic Party officials to provide copies of other suspected faked documents that have been circulating along with emails and other legitimate documents taken in the hack, people involved in those conversations said.

A spokesman for the FBI confirmed the agency was ""in receipt of a complaint about an alleged fake letter"" related to the election but declined further comment. Others with knowledge of the matter said the FBI was also examining other fake documents that recently surfaced.U.S. intelligence officials have warned privately that a campaign they believe is backed by the Russian government to undermine the credibility of the U.S. presidential election could move beyond the hacking of Democratic Party email systems. That could include posting fictional evidence of voter fraud or other disinformation in the run-up to voting on Nov. 8, U.S. officials have said.Russian officials deny any such effort. In addition to the Carper letter, the FBI has also reviewed a seven-page electronic document that carries the logos of Democratic pollster Joel Benenson's firm, the Benenson Strategy Group, and the Clinton Foundation, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
The document, identified as a fake by the Clinton campaign, claims poll ratings had plunged for Clinton and called for ""severe strategy changes for November"" that could include ""staged civil unrest"" and ""radiological attack"" with dirty bombs to disrupt the vote.Like the Carper letter, it was not immediately clear where the fraudulent document had originated or how it had begun to circulate.   On Oct. 20, Roger Stone, a former Trump aide and Republican operative, linked to a copy of the document on Twitter with the tag, ""If this is real: OMG!!""
Benenson's firm had no immediate comment. Craig Minassian, a spokesman for the Clinton Foundation, said the document was ""fake."" He said he did not know if the FBI had examined it.Stone did not respond to emails requesting comment.A spokesman for the Clinton campaign, Glen Caplin, said the document was a fake and part of a ""desperate stunt"" to capitalize on the leak of Democratic emails by Wikileaks.  The developments highlight the unusually prominent role U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies have played in a contentious election and an ongoing debate about how public they can or should be about their inquiries.FBI Director James Comey, a Republican appointed by President Obama, touched off an outcry from Democrats last week when he alerted Congress that agents had found other emails that could be linked to an inquiry into Clinton's use of a private email server when she was Secretary of State, effectively re-opening an investigation he had closed in July.

 (Editors note: Attention to language in the second paragraph that some readers may find offensive.)A local North Carolina Republican headquarters was spray-painted with an anti-Donald Trump message early on Friday, the second time in a month that a party office in the state has been defaced.A vandal sprayed the door and walls of the Alamance County Republican Party headquarters in Burlington with the words ""Fuck Trump"" and painted over the word ""Republican"" on a sign at the office at about 2 a.m. local time, according to Chris Verdeck, assistant police chief in the city.No arrests have been made in the incident, which was caught on surveillance video footage, Verdeck said in a phone interview. The vandalism in Burlington, which is located about 20 miles east of Greensboro, occurred four days before the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday.The contest between Republican candidate Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has been one of the most bitterly fought presidential campaigns in years.Police released a still image from the surveillance video of the vandal, who appeared to be a young man with a light complexion and dark hair wearing a light-colored hooded sweatshirt. The man appeared to have acted alone, Verdeck said.
""This is deeply troubling to our Alamance County GOP members and volunteers, but even more so, this is troubling for our nation,"" Alamance County Republican Party Chairman Ben York said in a statement.""It is my hope that we can be an example to the world that this behavior is unacceptable and it will not deter us from the noble responsibility we have to live and vote in the freedom that has been given to us."" Last month, the Orange County Republican Party's office in Hillsborough, which sits about 25 miles east of Burlington, was set on fire and a graffiti message left nearby said ""leave town or else."" 
Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Trump's vice presidential running mate, called the Hillsborough incident ""political terrorism.""North Carolina is considered one of the battleground states in the election, with its likely outcome unknown, giving it the chance to play a decisive role in the Electoral College vote that ultimately decides the presidency.
Democratic establishments have also been targeted in the run-up to the election, which has been distinguished by vitriol and sometimes violent acts hurled between Republicans and Democrats.Earlier this week, a historic black church in Greenville, Mississippi, was burned and spray-painted with ""Vote Trump.""Black churches in the U.S. South have long been a base of support for the Democratic Party.

By Julia Harte

 (This version of the November 3 story officially corrects paragraph 13 to read Chapel Hill, instead of Raleigh. The White House initially misidentified Obama's location in a transcript of his remarks)By Julia HarteASHEBORO, N.C. When Bill McAnulty, an elections board chairman in a mostly white North Carolina county, agreed in July to open a Sunday voting site where black church members could cast ballots after services, the reaction was swift: he was labeled a traitor by his fellow Republicans.""I became a villain, quite frankly,"" recalled McAnulty at a state board of elections meeting in September that had been called to resolve disputes over early voting plans. ""I got accused of being a traitor and everything else by the Republican Party,"" McAnulty said.Following the blowback from Republicans, McAnulty later withdrew his support for the Sunday site.In an interview with Reuters, he said he ultimately ruled against opening the Sunday voting site in Randolph County because he had ""made a mistake in reading the wishes of the voters."" He declined to discuss the episode further.This year's highly charged presidential contest between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump has stoked accusations by both parties of political meddling in the scheduling of early voting hours in North Carolina, a coveted battleground state with a history of tight elections.In emails, state and county Republican officials lobbied  members of at least 17 county election boards to keep early-voting sites open for shorter hours on weekends and in evenings - times that usually see disproportionately high turnout by Democratic voters. Reuters obtained the emails through a public records request.The officials also urged county election boards to open fewer sites for residents to cast ballots during early voting that began on Oct. 20 and ends on Saturday.Civil rights advocates and Democrats launched their own campaigns for expanded early voting hours. The tug-of-war yielded mixed results.The state did ultimately add nearly 5,900 more hours and 78 more sites to vote early than in 2012. But several counties  opened only one polling site during the first week of early voting, slightly denting turnout across the state. Voter turnout dropped by 20 percent in the counties that had multiple polling sites during the first week of early voting in 2012 but just one site during the first week in 2016.""We currently have more early voting locations and hours open than ever were open under Democrat control,"" said North Carolina Republican Party executive director Dallas Woodhouse, denying his party was trying to suppress the Democratic vote.President Barack Obama praised the expanded early voting opportunities during an election stop in North Carolina on Wednesday.""Those who wanted to suppress the vote, they're going to fail,"" he said at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in Chapel Hill. ""Right now, there are more one-stop early vote sites in North Carolina than ever before."" 
Counties that Obama, a Democrat, won in 2012 increased their Sunday hours this year by 16 percent, while counties that voted for his Republican rival, Mitt Romney, decreased them by nearly a quarter, the records show.State Republican officials say keeping polls open during evenings and weekends, or ""off-hour"" times, drains county resources.'FOLKS ARE ANGRY'
In two emails, on Aug. 11 and Aug. 14, Woodhouse urged Republicans serving on county election boards to follow the ""party line"" on curtailing the early voting period. ""Many of our folks are angry and opposed to Sunday voting,"" he wrote. ""Six days of voting in one week is enough. Period."" Keeping polling sites open for the full 17-day early voting period ""may be wasteful and unnecessary,"" he added. Woodhouse's emails were subsequently published by local media, but he was not alone in lobbying to limit voting hours, the Reuters review of public records shows. The review counted similar emails from at least four other Republican Party officials to election boards, each of which is composed of two Republicans and one Democrat.
The same day that Woodhouse sent his Aug. 11 email, Elaine Hewitt, a member of the Rowan County Republican Executive Committee, sent the county elections board two proposed schedules for early voting, both of which included just one site for the first four days and no sites on Sundays. ""With all of the opportunities to vote by mail, early in person Monday - Saturday, and on Election Day, there is no justification for requiring election workers to work on Sundays,"" she wrote. Garry Terry, the chairman of the Republican Party for North Carolina's First Congressional District, sent an email on Aug. 13 to elections board members in his region, reminding them to act ""in the best interest of the Republican Party"" by opposing Sunday voting and restricting early voting to one location.Hewitt and Terry did not respond to requests for comment. Woodhouse defended the actions of the Republican officials, telling Reuters that Republican opposition to Sunday voting was not discriminatory but was rather based on the belief that people should not be required to work on Sundays.The Sunday polling site that McAnulty first supported and then opposed would have been located at the Randolph County Board of Elections office and would have cost around $1,000 to operate, according to the office director.""If it's not wasteful and it allows more people to vote... the board has historically been for that,"" Margaret Megerian, the Democratic member of board, told Reuters.    

'A SIGNIFICANT TRIUMPH'
In contrast with the Republicans' email campaign, the Democratic push to expand early voting hours has largely taken shape in public forums.In Democratic-leaning Guilford County, the state's third largest, a county board of elections meeting on Aug. 8 attracted about 75 people after word spread that the board was planning to halve the number of early voting sites, from 24 in 2012.The Rev. Nelson Johnson said in an interview that the proposal by the board's Republican chairwoman would ""prevent voting especially by people who can't easily take time off"" and said it ""absolutely"" had a racial intent. Johnson, who is African American, leads a community center in Greensboro, North Carolina.Board Chairwoman Kathryn Lindley told Reuters she believed ""a lesser number of sites would cause less confusion about which places were going to be open,"" and that it was ""ludicrous"" to think her suggested plan had been discriminatory.The board ultimately agreed to 25 early voting sites and one day of Sunday voting before the November election. Johnson said the decision was ""a significant triumph."" Lindley said Johnson's group had no influence on the final outcome.Guilford's plan also included one restriction that particularly angered Democrats. In the first week of early voting in 2012, residents could vote at 16 sites. This year, that has been reduced to one. Mary Cranford, 52, a registered Republican, was fourth in line on the first day of early voting in Guilford. She was able to vote but said she was upset that only one site was open for the first week. She said she voted for Clinton this year. ""I can't believe what's been done to keep some people from voting in this state,"" she said.Just 7,916 people voted in the first week of early voting in Guilford this year, compared to 60,732 in 2012, according to state elections board records.The general counsel for Clinton's campaign and other plaintiffs filed a court motion on Oct. 1 demanding Guilford and four other North Carolina counties expand their early voting opportunities. The court denied it, saying that changing the early voting plans ""would create logistical difficulties.""

By Karen Pierog and Robin Respaut
| CHICAGO/SAN FRANCISCO

CHICAGO/SAN FRANCISCO U.S. voters on Tuesday will decide the fate of $70.3 billion of municipal bond issuance, the largest amount of borrowing requests in a decade, with much of it earmarked to help pay for fixing the nation's crumbling infrastructure.The biggest concentration of bonds hanging in the balance  is in California, which accounts for nearly 60 percent of the total.Nationwide, the state, school and local government bond measures, 682 in total, would fund building and repairing schools, mass transit and roads, and even biomedical research in one state, according to data company Ipreo.To view the historical amount of bond ballot measures, click on tmsnrt.rs/2e9Z5bb.The governments will be able to take advantage of still-low borrowing costs and a stable economy, even when considering the possibility of an increase in historically low benchmark interest rates by the Federal Reserve in December.""This year, the finances at the state level look better. We've had more stability in revenues and more stability in the economy as a whole, so we would expect a substantial amount of these proposals to be accepted,"" said Philip Fischer, municipal research strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Yields on top-rated 10 and 30-year bonds hit all-time lows in July on the U.S. municipal market's benchmark scale. While yields have risen since then they remain attractive for state and local government borrowers.
BOND MEASURES PLENTIFUL IN CALIFORNIA
California ballots are bursting with 195 bond measures totaling $41.7 billion, including the biggest nationwide -- $9 billion of state general obligation debt to finance new construction and modernization for K-12 and charter schools and community colleges.Another California ballot measure is aimed at reining in debt by requiring statewide voter approval for revenue bonds exceeding $2 billion for projects financed, owned, or managed by the state. Opponents of the initiative, called Proposition 53, say mandating voter approval would delay critical infrastructure projects. ""The drought over the past four years has highlighted the need for infrastructure in California,"" said David Guy, Northern California Water Association president, at a September panel on California propositions. ""We don't need another hurdle to progress in California.""
While school and infrastructure financing are dominant themes this election, a measure on Montana's statewide ballot would create a biomedical research authority funded by $200 million of bonds over 10 years.Voters will also be weighing 154 state-wide measures, including bonds, taxes, gun control and the minimum wage, in 35 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In several states, voters will be deciding whether to increase various sales, income, property, cigarette and other taxes. For example, in Colorado there is a proposed constitutional amendment calling for a public option universal healthcare payment system, funded by a new 10 percent state payroll tax. Employers would cover two-thirds and employees one-third of the cost, according to the citizen-led initiative known as Amendment 69.
Washington state voters will weigh the nation's first tax on carbon emissions, while five states, including California, seek to legalize and tax recreational marijuana.Oregon voters will consider changing the corporate tax code to collect revenue equivalent to one-third of the state's general fund expenditures. The legislature would decide how to use the proceeds. Eno Center for Transportation, a nonprofit think tank, reported that voters will decide tax and bond measures for roads, seaports, railroads, airports and mass transit that would raise an estimated $250 billion for specified projects over a period of years during which specific taxes would be collected.These include $3.5 billion of bonds to repair and improve the San Francisco area's BART transit system, a regional property tax hike to raise $3.1 billion over 20 years for mass transit in the Detroit area and $70 million of bonds to improve Rhode Island's seaport.Kerry O'Hare, vice president of Building America's Future, a bipartisan coalition on infrastructure investment, said the dearth of reliable long-term federal transportation funding has left a void that state and local governments are trying to address via ballot measures.""At the state and local level, it's 'Listen, we need to step up and raise money for transportation needs,'"" she said.

By Julia Harte and Dustin Volz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Federal and state authorities are beefing up cyber defenses against potential electronic attacks on voting systems ahead of U.S. elections on Nov. 8, but few are taking new steps to guard against possible civil unrest or violence.The threat of computer hacking and the potential for violent clashes is darkening an already rancorous presidential race between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, amid fears that Russia or other actors could spread political misinformation online or perhaps tamper with voting.To counter the cyber threat, all but two U.S. states have accepted help from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to probe and scan voter registration and election systems for vulnerabilities, a department official told Reuters.Ohio has asked a cyber protection unit of the National Guard, a reserve force within the U.S. military, for assistance to protect the state's systems.On Thursday, Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan and her cyber security team met with officials from the FBI and the DHS, in addition to state-level agencies, to discuss cyber threats, said Matt Roberts, a spokesman for Reagan.The National Governors Association on Friday said election officials were well prepared for possible cyber threats and had been confronting them for over a decade.""We remain confident that any technical problems on Election Night will not undermine the overall integrity of the process,"" the association said in a statement.
Unidentified intelligence officials told NBC News on Thursday there is no specific warning about an Election Day attack, but they remain concerned hackers from Russia or elsewhere may try to disrupt the process, likely by spreading misinformation through social media sites.ARMED GROUPS
The potential for violence around the election has loomed in the background of the campaign for months. Armed groups around the country have pledged in unprecedented numbers to monitor voting sites for signs of election fraud.
Federal officials have warned authorities in New York, Texas and Virginia about an unspecific threat of attacks by the al Qaeda militant group around Election Day, putting local law enforcement on alert before Tuesday's vote.A U.S. government source in Washington said some federal agencies sent bulletins to local and state officials flagging the information but that the threat was relatively low level.""We are continuing with the high level of patrols at all of our facilities that we have had in place for some time now,"" said spokesman Steve Coleman of the Port Authority, which operates airports, tunnels and bridges around the area.
Voter intimidation reported at polling sites so far prompted Democrats to accuse Trump of a ""campaign of vigilante voter intimidation"" in four states on Monday.But local authorities surveyed by Reuters on Thursday in five states - Ohio, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Wisconsin and Florida - said they were not increasing election-related law enforcement personnel or resources above 2012 levels.The FBI, which designates one special agent from each of its 56 field offices for election crime matters, has not increased its numbers or given staff additional training this year, said an FBI spokeswoman.There has been no ""substantive change"" in the number of personnel deployed by the rest of the Justice Department, which designates Assistant U.S. Attorneys and federal prosecutors within the agency's Public Integrity Section to handle election crimes, according to a spokesman.Jim Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, which represents hundreds of thousands of U.S. officers, said cops are taking the same security measures they would take for any large event. He said he expects the vows by militias to monitor the polls to be ""a lot of talk, little action.""
