By James Oliphant and David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Congressional Republicans on Tuesday accused Hillary Clinton's State Department of failing to protect four Americans killed in a 2012 attack in Libya, in a final report that contained no major new revelations but rekindled debate on the U.S. presidential campaign trail.In an 800-page report that Democrats derided as a political vendetta, Republicans said Clinton, who served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 and is now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, and her staff showed a ""shameful"" lack of response to congressional investigators looking into the attacks on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.The report, the culmination of a two-year investigation by a special congressional committee led by Republican Representative Trey Gowdy, is likely to be the last official attempt to investigate the attack. Seven other congressional panels have also investigated the attack on the U.S. diplomatic and CIA posts in Benghazi.The latest investigation has been used by Republicans to attack Clinton's national-security credentials. Opinion polls have shown Americans deeply split along partisan lines over the probe.Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has repeatedly charged that Clinton is personally responsible for the deaths of a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans killed by militia groups in the Sept. 11, 2012 incident.Clinton's campaign dismissed the committee's report, saying it had not found anything that had not been discovered by previous congressional probes. White House press secretary Josh Earnest labeled the effort a ""political exercise.""Clinton, speaking in Denver, said it was crucial to ""learn the right lessons"" from the Benghazi tragedy.""No one has thought more about or lost more sleep over the lives that we lost - the four Americans - which was devastating,"" said Clinton.Trump waited until hours after the report's release to comment. ""Benghazi is just another Hillary Clinton failure,"" he said on Twitter. ""It just never seems to work the way it's supposed to with Clinton.""Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Clinton's actions as secretary of state were ""disqualifying.""
""Hillary Clinton was in charge, knew the risks, and did nothing"" to protect personnel on the ground in Libya, he said.Professor Julian Zelizer, a political analyst at Princeton University, called the report ""old news"" but said that would not stop Trump from trying to exploit the issue going forward. ""A story like this, even though it seems familiar, can still serve to mobilize Republicans, and certainly Donald Trump will do that. He'll certainly try,"" Zelizer said. Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist, said he doubted the report would influence undecided voters. ""Those who are willing to believe that there was wrongdoing on Secretary Clinton's part were unlikely willing to vote for her in the first place,"" he said.SYSTEMIC SECURITY LAPSES
At a news conference on Capitol Hill, Gowdy, chairman of the special congressional panel, said there was a disconnect between the violence unfolding in Benghazi and the perception among top Obama administration officials that ""the fighting had subsided"" at the U.S. diplomatic compound.
The committee's report faulted the State Department for providing inadequate security for the U.S. compound in Benghazi, State Department officials and the CIA for failing to properly evaluate the threat to U.S. personnel on the ground, and the Pentagon for not being in position to aid the Americans under siege. The report did not dispute assertions by the Obama administration that such a mission would have come too late to help the four who were killed.None of those conclusions, however, came as revelations. All had been reached by previous probes.The report also accused the White House of stonewalling the investigation, something aides to Obama have denied.Democrats on the Benghazi committee issued their own report a day before Tuesday's release, accusing Republicans of conducting an overzealous investigation.According to a website maintained by committee Democrats, the investigation cost more than $7.1 million, a figure that excludes money spent on investigations by the seven other congressional committees that investigated the attacks.
The Gowdy committee investigation lasted 782 days, longer than congressional probes of Pearl Harbor, the Kennedy assassination, the Iran-Contra scandal and Hurricane Katrina.Since it was established in May 2014, the Gowdy committee has held four public hearings, according to its website, which said that it interviewed 107 witnesses, mostly behind closed doors, including 81 who never appeared before the other committees that investigated the attacks. It reviewed about 75,000 pages of previously unexamined documents.CLINTON HAS REBUFFED CHARGES
Last October, Clinton, already a Democratic presidential candidate, calmly deflected harsh Republican criticism of her handling of the attack during a testy 11-hour hearing before the Gowdy committee.In testimony that stretched deep into the night, Clinton rejected Republican accusations that she ignored requests for security upgrades in Libya and misinformed the public about the cause of the attack.Clinton's appearance before the panel followed months of controversy about her use of a private home email server for her State Department work, a disclosure that emerged in part because of the panel's demand to see her official records.A 2012 report by a government accountability review board faulted State Department officials for providing ""grossly"" insufficient security in Benghazi, despite upgrade requests from Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and others in Libya. (Reporting by Richard Cowan, David Morgan, Jonathan Landay, Amanda Becker and Adam DeRose; Written by James Oliphant; Editing by Caren Bohan)"

By Bill Berkrot

It could take years to learn how long men infected with Zika are capable of sexually transmitting the virus, which can cause crippling birth defects and other serious neurological disorders.In the meantime, health officials have warned couples to refrain from unprotected sex for six months after a male partner is infected. The extraordinary recommendation, based on a single report of Zika surviving 62 days in semen, could affect millions.The grave risks associated with Zika, along with its potential reach, are driving U.S. health authorities to pursue research even though funding is mired in Congressional gridlock. A study of sexual transmission risk is one example of science that health officials said can't wait for politics.Borrowing money earmarked for other programs, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has started enrolling men infected with Zika in Brazil and Colombia in the study to determine how long the virus remains transmittable in semen. The study could take years to complete, but interim results could help public health officials fine-tune their recommendations on sex.""We are going out on a limb, but we have to,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. institute, said in an interview. ""We can't say we're going to wait until we get all the money.""Public health officials are alarmed by Zika's transmission versatility, which has the potential to expand its reach. It is primarily spread by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, as are the dengue and chikungunya viruses.But at least 10 countries, including the United States and France, have reported Zika infections in people who had not traveled to an outbreak area but whose sexual partners had. This ability to spread through sex could help Zika gain a further foothold outside the warm habitats of its most effective agent, the mosquito.    CAUTION IN LIEU OF ANSWERS

To protect women who are pregnant or trying to conceive, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended couples refrain from unprotected sex for six months - triple the 62 days the virus survived in the semen in one British case study. The World Health Organization recently issued similar guidance.But such strict advice is not ideal, Dr. Anne Schuchat, a CDC deputy director, said in an interview.""To tell people not to have sex until we get back to you is not a very satisfying recommendation,"" she said. ""We would like to have some more understanding of the sexual risk.""In the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, where more than 2,100 cases of infection have been reported since the start of the year, health officials are passing out Zika protection kits that include bug spray and condoms, along with the recommendation.But the warning against unprotected sex isn't going over very well, said Dr. Chris Prue, a CDC behavioral scientist who has studied the response.
""Condoms are not popular in a lot places,"" she said. ""There's religious and personal preferences and lots of personal factors in that.""U.S. lawmakers deadlocked over funding to fight the Zika virus on Tuesday, as Senate Democrats blocked a Republican proposal they said fell short of the challenge posed by the virus and hurt other health priorities. It was unclear when Congress would revisit the request by President Barack Obama for $1.9 billion.FUNDING PRIORITIES

In the meantime, the White House has diverted more than $500 million earmarked for other projects for urgent Zika initiatives, including those where scientific opportunities will be lost if not acted upon immediately.One such study will follow children born to women infected with Zika to identify the development of any disabilities not detected at birth. Other projects on the priority list include vaccine development and mosquito eradication.    One study underway will assess whether the risk of transmission is greater from men who experience Zika infection symptoms, such as fever and rash, than from those who don't. This information is considered vital since most people experience no symptoms.The study of infected men in Brazil and Colombia will test semen from thousands of men over time to determine how long Zika poses a risk to sexual partners. As long the virus can be grown in a laboratory from semen cell samples, infectious disease experts believe it is potentially contagious.Zika typically clears the bloodstream about a week after infection, but it has been detected in urine for at least twice as long. Its persistence in semen in the British case study has caused some researchers to draw comparisons to other viruses.HIV can last in blood and semen indefinitely, and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus can reside in the kidneys and urine for years, researchers said. One patient who survived the deadly Ebola outbreak had evidence of that virus in his semen for 18 months.""We got very surprised by Ebola that it was hanging around for so long,"" said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.""One of the big questions we have to ask is does Zika also cause a similar type of latency?""

By Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate gave solid approval on Wednesday to a relief plan to help Puerto Rico address its $70 billion debt, sending the measure to President Obama for his signing into law just ahead of a possible default by the U.S. territory on its next debt payment.The measure passed the Senate on a vote of 68-30, and President Obama said in a statement he looked forward to signing the bill into law. The House of Representatives has already approved the bill.""This bill is not perfect, but it is a critical first step toward economic recovery and restored hope for millions of Americans who call Puerto Rico home,"" Obama said. The legislation would create a federal oversight board, appointed by Washington, with power to restructure Puerto Rico's unmanageable debt load.The bill provides for a stay, or halt, to any litigation brought against the Puerto Rican government and its debt issuing agencies that is retroactive to December. This provides breathing room for the board to start the process of restructuring and oversee a sustainable budget process. On Friday, Puerto Rico faces a potential default on a chunk of its debt if it cannot make $1.9 billion worth of payments. Puerto Rico's Governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, has said the island will default some of the debt.Supporters said intervention by Washington lawmakers was necessary to help the island's 3.5 million U.S. citizens avert a ""descent into chaos,"" as U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Tuesday.Puerto Rico has been waiting for months for Congress to act as its economic crisis worsened. It has already defaulted on some of its debt. The Caribbean island territory is reeling from a 45 percent poverty rate, as well as a steady flow of migration to the U.S. mainland that shrinks its tax base and shuttering of essential services.In addition, it is suffering from a Zika virus outbreak that is hurting its critical tourism industry.
But many Puerto Ricans are leery of the proposed oversight board, fearing it could usurp the island's government and place investors' concerns over local priorities. Puerto Rico's benchmark 2035 General Obligation bond rose 1 full point in price ahead of the final vote, to trade at 66.75 points, pushing the yield down to 12.663 percent. Passage of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) came after leaders of both political parties warned that failure to approve the legislation could lead to a U.S. taxpayer-funded bailout.""This is the best and possibly the only action we can take to help Puerto Rico,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said.""Doing nothing now ... (is) the surest route to both a taxpayer funded bailout of Puerto Rico and a humanitarian crisis for its people,"" McConnell said.
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said he shared the concerns of many Democrats with the ""excessive powers and appointment structure"" of the oversight board, and he was unhappy with some labor provisions.But Reid said he was voting for passage because Puerto Rico needed the help by Friday. ""Otherwise we ... turn them  over to the hedge funds and they will sue them to death,"" he said.The seven member board, appointed by President Obama from recommendations given by party leaders in both the House and Senate, is supposed to be in place by Sept. 1, 2016.Neither political party was entirely happy with the fix.
Democrats bridled at a Republican provision that might lower the minimum wage for some young workers and weaken overtime pay rules while some Republicans were concerned the bill could amount to a bailout of the island, or set a precedent for states in fiscal trouble to seek a similar arrangement.""They'll say if a territory can receive unprecedented authority from Congress, then why shouldn't a state?"" asked Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa.The legislation is geared toward U.S. territories. Puerto Rico is not covered by current U.S. bankruptcy law under Chapter 9.Democratic Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, opposing the measure, argued that Friday was an arbitrary deadline for action that did not excuse a ""flawed"" bill.A vote for the bill was ""a vote to authorize an unelected, unchecked and all powerful control board to determine Puerto Rico's destiny for a generation or more,"" Menendez declared.Some senators, including Vermont independent Bernie Sanders, criticized the estimated $370 million cost of the legislation over five years, complaining that Puerto Rico will get stuck with the tab while it is struggling to reduce its debt. Sanders blasted this as ""colonialism at its worst.""The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which issued that estimate, said that about $350 million of the total ""would primarily cover fees of legal and financial consultants hired to restructure Puerto Rico's debt.""

By Roberta Rampton
| OTTAWA

OTTAWA U.S. President Barack Obama said on Wednesday he expects the world economy will be steady in the short run after Britain's decision to leave the European Union but expressed concern about longer term global growth.Obama, appearing at a North American summit with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, said there have been reactions in markets, stock prices and currencies since last Thursday's so-called Brexit vote.Preparations by central banks, finance ministers and the U.S. treasury secretary helped ensure the global economy will hold steady in the short term, he said at a news conference.
""I think there are some genuine longer term concerns about global growth if in fact Brexit goes through and that freezes the possibilities of investment in Great Britain or in Europe as a whole,"" Obama said. ""At a time when global growth rates were weak already, this doesn't help.""The U.S. president, who had openly sided with British Prime Minister David Cameron against Brexit, said the leaders of G20 nations, who will meet in China this year, will have to work to boost global demand and fortify the global economy. 
Obama said that, while the special relationship between Britain and the United States will endure, that country's absence from the EU would ""make it harder for us to solve some of the other challenges that have to be solved.""He said his main message to Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders involved in the Brexit would be: ""Everybody should catch their breath, come up with a plan and a process that is orderly, that's transparent, that people understand and then proceed, understanding that both sides have a stake in getting this right.
""And I think that will be a difficult, challenging process but it does not need to be a panicky process."" (Reporting by Roberta Rampton and Jeff Mason; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Tom Brown and James Dalgleish)"

By Kim Palmer
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND A federal judge ruled on Wednesday that Ohio's secretary of state was within his rights to strip thousands of inactive voters from the rolls, rejecting a legal challenge by civil liberties activists who claimed that the purge disenfranchised minorities and the poor.The decision by U.S. District Judge George C. Smith in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union could impact the presidential race in Ohio, a key swing state seen as potentially pivotal in the Nov. 8 election. No Republican has won the White House without carrying Ohio. The ACLU charged in its lawsuit that Ohio Secretary of State John Husted's policy of removing from the rolls voters deemed inactive over a six-year period violated the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 because it targets minorities and lower-income voters who tend to favor Democrats.
Smith disagreed, finding that the policy was not illegal because it removed voters from the rolls only after they failed to vote and then did not respond to a change of address confirmation.""Ohio's procedures of maintaining the voter registration rolls ensure the integrity of the election process,"" Smith wrote.
Husted has said that the policy has been in place since the 1990s under both Republican and Democratic secretaries of state.""While today's ruling reaffirms that the process Ohio has used for over two decades is constitutional and in line with state and federal law, the best news is that we can put another wasteful lawsuit behind us and focus on the important work of running elections in Ohio,"" Husted said in a statement.

By Roberta Rampton
| OTTAWA

OTTAWA U.S. President Barack Obama is tired of hearing Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump described as a populist.The Democratic leader, who has made no secret of his dislike for the wealthy businessman's rhetoric, closed a news conference in Canada on Wednesday with a long riff on what makes a leader qualified for the ""populist"" mantra.Trump did not meet the criteria, Obama said, without mentioning the Republican by name.""Somebody ... who has never shown any regard for workers, has never fought on behalf of social justice issues or making sure that poor kids are getting a decent shot at life or have health care,"" does not meet the definition, Obama said.""They don't suddenly become a populist because they say something controversial in order to win votes. That's not the measure of populism. That's nativism, or xenophobia. Or worse. Or it's just cynicism,"" he said.
Trump won enough grassroots support among Republicans to make him the party's presumptive presidential nominee with a pledge to ban Muslims temporarily from entering the United States and to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico, and a series of other inflammatory remarks.Obama has sharply criticized Trump for such rhetoric. He plans to campaign with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, next week. The president's latest criticism of Trump could foreshadow Obama's strategy to help Clinton on the campaign trail. 
He made a point of saying U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Clinton's opponent in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, genuinely deserved the title of populist. Sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist and generated huge support from young people across the United States in his campaign.
Clinton needs those supporters now, and Obama, who won the White House in 2008 and 2012 with a similar coalition, will try to help deliver them for her.Obama, who leaves office in January, made his comments on Wednesday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto looking on.""Sorry,"" Obama said after his more-than-six-minute monologue. ""It's the prerogative of an outgoing president to go on an occasional rant, he said. (Reporting by Roberta Rampton; Writing by Jeff Mason; Editing by Bill Rigby)"

By Ginger Gibson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Presidential candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday lashed out at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's scathing criticism of his stance on trade, highlighting divisions within the Republican Party that threaten unity ahead of the Nov. 8 election.At a campaign rally in Maine on Wednesday, Trump called the nation's largest business association ""controlled totally by various groups of people who don't care about you whatsoever.""He said new trade deals should be negotiated because foreign countries are taking advantage of America.""Every country that we do business with us look at us as the stupid people with the penny bank,"" Trump said Wednesday at the rally in Bangor, Maine.The Washington-based lobbying group, which represents the United States' largest companies and business interests, is typically a reliable backer of Republican policies. But on Tuesday it took issue with Trump's vocal opposition to trade deals, calling his proposals ""dangerous"" ideas that would push the United States into another recession.Trump said the Chamber's argument that his policies would cause a trade war were incorrect because the United States was already at a deficit. ""We're already losing the trade war, we lost the trade war,"" Trump said. ""Nothing can happen worse than is happening now.""In speeches on Tuesday, Trump called for renegotiating or scrapping the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico, calling it a job killer, and reiterated opposition to the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership among the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries. He also lambasted China's trade and currency policies.
The Chamber has consistently backed trade deals.     The public squabbling between the presumptive Republican nominee and the business group was unusual, one of a series of reminders that Trump still struggles to unite his party behind his campaign. The Republicans and many business leaders tend to share policy goals and work in lockstep, and many business leaders have traditionally been big donors to Republican candidates.So far, the Chamber's political action committee has donated $134,000 to federal candidates or their committees, with $127,500 of that total going to Republicans, according to U.S. government campaign finance records.Billionaire Republican donor Paul Singer, who bankrolled an effort to try to defeat Trump during the campaign's nominating phase, said on Wednesday that a Trump presidency and his trade positions would almost certainly lead to a global depression.""The most impactful of the economic policies that I recall him coming out for are these anti-trade policies,"" Singer said during a panel discussion at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado, according to CNBC.
But opposing trade deals has proven a winning strategy for Trump among voters concerned about the loss of manufacturing jobs. Art Laffer, an economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan who supports Trump, said he did not like the tone of Trump's speech on Tuesday but thought it was an improvement over his past comments on trade.""It's not terribly alarming to me,"" Laffer said. ""I didn't see any 45 percent tariffs across the board. ...""I saw negotiating better trade deals rather than throwing away all the trade deals we have now. He points out the flaws in these trades, and that's all true,"" Laffer said. ""I don't like the tone of it, but I dislike the tone less today than I did three weeks ago.""
Peter Navarro, a Trump trade policy adviser, defended the candidate's position.""Here's the central point to understand: The White House has been utterly and completely soft on China's illegal trade practices,"" said Navarro, a professor at the University of California, Irvine. ""The status quo is the worst of all possible worlds for the United States."" Trump also took fire from for his positions on trade from Democrats.In a call organized by rival Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, U.S. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a former businessman and tech entrepreneur, said that while the country needed to do a better job protecting workers, more resources should be put into training them for a new economy.He also noted that it was unusual to see a Republican standard-bearer and the Chamber divide. ""You've really got a special circumstance when the U.S. Chamber of Commerce"" responded to Trump's economic plan with a ""full-fledged onslaught,"" Warner said. ""No one could have predicted this kind of election season.""Clinton held no public campaign events on Wednesday but did announce she would appear next week with President Barack Obama, the first time this year that he and his former Secretary of State have campaigned together.

By Tom Polansek
| CHICAGO

CHICAGO U.S. agriculture groups are pushing for continuing talks with the presumptive Democratic and Republican presidential nominees in an effort to influence their farm policy positions as a slump in crop prices squeezes the sector's profits.Representatives of about a dozen trade associations, including the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Farmers Union, met with staffers for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton on Friday at her New York campaign headquarters.It was the farm coalition's first meeting with Clinton's staff and included discussions of issues ranging from agricultural trade and labor to mandatory labels for foods containing genetically modified ingredients, attendees said on Wednesday.The meeting was the start of a push by the sector for more details from Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump about their stances on issues affecting farmers and agribusiness. The groups are seeking a meeting with Trump's campaign.""All of us agreed, on both sides of the table, that it is a successful meeting only if it's the first of a number of exchanges,"" said Jay Vroom, the chief executive of pesticide association CropLife America, who attended the session.
The candidates' agriculture policies are crucial, the groups say, because net U.S. farm income is forecast to drop to its lowest since 2002, largely due to a decline in grain prices. If that happens, incomes will be down 56 percent from a recent high of $123.3 billion in 2013.""With that kind of climate, we're definitely concerned about what farm policy will look like building to the next (congressional) farm bill,"" said Tom Bryant, the National Farmers Union's membership director.    
If elected, Clinton will increase agricultural production and profitability for family farms, spokesman Tyrone Gayle said. A Trump spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Matt Paul, a former U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesman working with Clinton's campaign, participated in the meeting.The gathering came a day after Britain's surprise vote to exit the European Union, which drew support from some regions with low population densities.
Chandler Goule, incoming CEO of the National Association of Wheat Growers, said farm groups drew parallels to Britain's referendum because ""it's going to be rural America that's going to turn out for this election, that's actually going to determine the outcome of this (presidential) election.""Now that Clinton and Trump are the presumed nominees, ""it's time to start making more detailed and more in-the-weeds-type commitments,"" he said.

| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND A federal judge on Wednesday authorized a new plan allowing protesters at next month's Republican National Convention in Cleveland to demonstrate in an area that will be readily visible to convention goers.The new plan, approved by U.S. District Judge Dan Aaron Polster, also cuts in half the size of an ""event zone"" where demonstrations and mobility will be limited and gives protesters more time to demonstrate.The agreement between the city of Cleveland and the American Civil Liberties Union resolves weeks of wrangling over the rules for what are expected to be lively protests when Donald Trump is due to become the Republican Party's official nominee for president at the July 18-21 convention.Trump campaign events have drawn raucous demonstrations,  with some resulting in clashes between his supporters and opponents.""This settlement is a significant improvement from what the city had previously offered,"" Christine Link, executive director for the ACLU of Ohio, said in a statement.
The ACLU sued on behalf of three groups planning to organize thousands of demonstrators, calling the rules too restrictive.Dan Williams, spokesman for Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson, described the changes as ""minor"" and said he did not believe there would be an increased security risk as a result.Cleveland originally planned to cordon off 3.3 square miles (8.5 square km) around the convention site as an event zone where free speech mobility would be limited. 
After another federal judge struck down the city's original plan, the two sides settled the lawsuit on Friday and took several days to work out details before revealing the new plan.The event zone is now 1.7 square miles (4.4 square km).The new zone frees up parkland where demonstrators will be able to organize before their protests. It also removes the Port of Cleveland and a small public airport for corporate jets and air taxi services from the restricted area.
The main parade route for demonstrators now extends deeper into central Cleveland and will be more visible from the sports arena where the main event will take place, and more within the view of delegates and the media. The previous route took demonstrators further away from the center of town and over a bridge where they would be seen primarily by themselves.In addition, groups were granted extra staging time between protests.The ACLU filed the lawsuit on behalf of Citizens for Trump, a Texas-based group that supports the businessman's campaign; Organize Ohio, a liberal activist group; and Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless, a charitable organization.
