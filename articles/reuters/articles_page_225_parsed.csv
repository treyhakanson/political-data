By Daniel Trotta and Daniel Wiessner

Officials from 11 U.S. states sued the Obama administration on Wednesday to overturn a directive telling schools to let transgender students use bathrooms matching their gender identity, decrying the policy as ""a massive social experiment.""Ramping up the simmering battles over contentious cultural issues in America, the states, led by Texas and most with Republican governors, accused the federal government of rewriting laws by ""administrative fiat.""""We are willing to fight this all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to,"" Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton told reporters in Austin. Amid a national debate on transgender rights, President Barack Obama's administration on May 13 told U.S. public schools that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting Republicans and paving the way for fights over federal funding and legal authority.The states' lawsuit accused the federal government of overstepping its constitutional powers by taking actions that should be left to Congress or individual states. It also challenged the Obama administration's interpretation of federal civil rights law with regard to sex and gender.The lawsuit said the administration ""conspired to turn workplace and educational settings across the country into laboratories for a massive social experiment, flouting the democratic process, and running roughshod over commonsense policies protecting children and basic privacy rights.""Texas was joined by Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin, plus Arizona's Department of Education and Maine's governor.Paxton said, ""It's about parents who are upset, grandparents who are upset. They want to see that the safety of their children is taken care of.""Transgender rights advocates argued it is transgender people who need protection, particularly transgender women who are disproportionately the victims of assaults and would be forced to use men's bathrooms if states succeed in forcing people to use bathrooms matching their sex at birth.Likewise, transgender men, many of whom grow facial hair, would be required to use women's bathrooms along with girls.
""This action puts students at risk for the sake of politics,"" said Alison Gill of the Trans United Fund advocacy group supporting transgender rights.Gill said the states' lawsuit did not reflect the position of most school boards and administrators.The administration's letter to the schools said that to get federal funding under existing rules, schools must agree not to treat students or activities differently on the basis of sex. That includes not treating transgender students differently from others of the same gender identity, officials said.'UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK'

Paul Castillo, a lawyer with Lambda Legal, which supports lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, said the lawsuit represented an ""unprecedented attack against transgender people across the United States.""""These states are demonstrating the great lengths they will go to in order to discriminate against transgender individuals,"" Castillo said.Nine of the 11 states that sued have Republican governors, including Maine's Paul LePage. LePage broke with the Democratic attorney general, Janet Mills, who did not approve of the lawsuit, a spokesman for Mills said.School districts from Texas and Arizona also joined the suit, which names the U.S. government and a host of federal  agencies and officials as defendants.North Carolina sued the federal government on the transgender bathroom issue this month, seeking to protect its state law passed in March that bans people from using public restrooms not corresponding to their sex assigned at birth.
Ever since the 1960s civil rights movement, the federal government has asserted its authority to force states to extend equal protection under the law for all. The administration sued North Carolina on May 9, stating that its transgender bathroom law violated the U.S. 1964 Civil Rights Act.The 11 states' lawsuit accused the administration of taking that argument too far and improperly, widening the scope of interpretation of civil rights law.Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs and activities. The administration's interpretation is that the word ""sex"" extends protection to transgender people, but the issue has not been settled in the courts.""I agree with the Obama administration that 'sex' includes 'gender,' and 'gender' includes 'gender identity,'"" said John Pagan of the University of Richmond's School of Law in Virginia.Peter Lake of Stetson University College of Law in Florida said the U.S. Supreme Court has taken a narrow view of the meaning of ""sex"" under the law, but in recent years lower courts have been more likely to defer to the Obama administration's broader definition.""My sense is a certain momentum is building for broader protection of (LGBT) rights, and we might be seeing a moment of federal civil rights law in long-term transition,"" Lake said.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

By Jonathan Allen
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Hillary Clinton broke government rules by using a private email server without approval for her work as U.S. secretary of state, an internal government watchdog said on Wednesday.The long-awaited report by the State Department inspector general was the first official audit of the controversial arrangement to be made public. It was highly critical of Clinton's use of a server in her home, and immediately fueled Republican attacks on Clinton, the Democratic front-runner in an already acrimonious presidential race. The report, which also found problems in department record-keeping practices before Clinton's tenure, undermined Clinton's earlier defenses of her emails, likely adding to Democratic anxieties about public perceptions of the candidate. A majority of voters say Clinton is dishonest, according to multiple polls. The report concluded that Clinton would not have been allowed to use the server in her home had she asked the department officials in charge of information security. The report said that staff who later raised concerns were told to keep quiet. Several suspected hacking attempts in 2011 were never reported to department information security officials, in breach of department rules, it said.""She's as crooked as they come,"" Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, said of Clinton at a campaign rally in Anaheim, California, adding that the report's findings were ""not good"" for her. Clinton's campaign disagreed, saying the report rebutted Republican's criticism.The inspector general's office examined email record-keeping under five secretaries state, both Democratic and Republican. John Kerry, the current officeholder, and predecessors Madeline Albright, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice all agreed to speak to the inspector general's investigators. Clinton was the only one who declined to be interviewed, as did her aides.The report contradicted Clinton's repeated assertion that her server was allowed and that no permission was needed. Several other inquiries continue, including a U.S. Justice Department investigation into whether the arrangement broke laws.The inspector general's report cited ""longstanding, systemic weaknesses"" with State Department records that predated Clinton's tenure, and found problems with the email record-keeping of some of her predecessors, particularly Powell, that failed to comply with the Federal Records Act. 
But it singled out Clinton for her decision to use a private server in her home in Chappaqua, New York, for government business.""OIG found no evidence that the Secretary requested or obtained guidance or approval to conduct official business via a personal email account on her private server,"" the report said, using an abbreviation for the office of inspector general.The report said Clinton should have discussed the arrangement with the department's security and technology officials. Officials told investigators that they ""did not - and would not - approve her exclusive reliance on a personal email account to conduct Department business."" The reason, those officials said, is because it breached department rules and presented ""security risks.""
CONCERNS SILENCED
State Department spokesman Mark Toner said he would not ""challenge"" those findings. He told reporters the department was aware of hacking attempts on Clinton's server, but had no evidence that any were successful. When two lower-level information technology officials tried to raise concerns about Clinton's email arrangement in late 2010, their supervisor in Clinton's office instructed them ""never to speak of the Secretary's personal email system again,"" the report said. Their supervisor told them that department lawyers had approved of the system, but the inspector general's office said it found no evidence this was true.Brian Fallon, a Clinton spokesman, said the report rebutted criticisms of Clinton made by her political opponents.""The report shows that problems with the State Department's electronic recordkeeping systems were longstanding and that there was no precedent of someone in her position having a State Department email account until after the arrival of her successor,"" he said in a statement.
He did not address the report's criticism of Clinton's use of a private server, something no other secretary of state has done.Democrats, including fundraisers for Clinton's campaign, said the report revealed nothing new.""It's digging and digging and digging,"" Amy Rao, the chief executive of data company Integrated Archive Systems and a Clinton fundraiser, said in an interview, comparing the investigation to probes the Clintons faced in the 1990s. ""Trust me: There's no there there. It's Whitewater.""Current Secretary of State Kerry asked Steve Linick, the State Department inspector general, to investigate after Clinton's email arrangement came to light last year. President Barack Obama appointed Linick to the role in 2013. Republicans have used Clinton's email practice to suggest she was trying to hide government records from scrutiny under public-access laws.Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement that the findings ""are just the latest chapter in the long saga of Hillary Clinton's bad judgment that broke federal rules and endangered our national security.""

By Patrick Rucker
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday backed a plan to help Puerto Rico escape crippling debt and expand the economy, a move that could put a rescue before the House of Representatives within days.The House Natural Resources Committee endorsed the plan by a 29-10 vote and left intact most provisions endorsed by House Speaker Paul Ryan.The plan would empower a federal oversight board to negotiate with investors and decide what they would recover from the roughly $70 billion they lent the island.Taxpayer money will not be spent in the rescue which would prevent a bailout, Ryan's office said in a statement on Wednesday.Puerto Rico's Governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla praised the bill for elements to help address insolvency, protect essential services and grow the economy. However, he reiterated reservations about the broad power of the oversight board.
""Puerto Ricans are Americans and our democratic rights need to be protected, just like those of American citizens living on the mainland, and the oversight provisions do not meet that obligation,"" he said in a statement, urging Ryan to amend the bill before it goes to the full House for a vote.    Under the plan, investors may not sue Puerto Rico while the oversight board does its work, and all the island's creditors could face a loss despite recent lobbying from Wall Street interest groups.Among Republicans who voted on Wednesday, more than half endorsed the rescue plan but a vocal minority warned that it would hurt investor demand for municipal bonds and force issuers to offer higher yields.
""Taxpayers across the country will have to pay ... as markets adjust to this new world,"" warned Congressman Tom McClintock of California.The bill, called the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act, passed without significant changes.
Speaker Ryan and Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House, in separate statements on Wednesday touted bipartisan support for the bill. If that holds, lawmakers may guide the rescue past the Senate to President Barack Obama before $1.9 billion in Puerto Rico debt is due on July 1.Republicans may demand more concessions while some Democrats find the oversight board too punitive. Democrats also want guarantees that the island's pension system, which has a shortfall of $40 billion, would be protected first.With the House and Senate set to begin a week-long Memorial Day holiday break at the end of this week, debate of the bill by the full House is not expected until sometime in June.

Melissa Gilbert, best known for playing Laura Ingalls Wilder in the 1970s television drama ""Little House on the Prairie,"" has dropped out of the race for a U.S. congressional seat in Michigan for medical reasons. Gilbert, 52, said continued problems from neck and back injuries from a 2012 accident forced her to give up her Democratic candidacy for the Republican-held seat.""While I have received the best treatment and therapy I could have asked for, those injuries have only gotten worse,"" Gilbert said in a statement. ""As much as it breaks my heart to say this, my doctors have told me I am physically unable to continue my run for Congress.""
Gilbert, who lives with her husband, actor Timothy Busfield, in Howell, Michigan, about 60 miles (100 km) from Detroit, has no political background but served two terms as president of the Screen Actors Guild from 2001 to 2005.She is the author of three books, including ""Prairie Tale: A Memoir,"" about her role in the show about a Minnesota farm family in the 1870s and 1880s.
Gilbert's departure from the race improved the already strong odds that U.S. Representative Mike Bishop, a Republican, would win a second two-year term in the district, the Detroit Free Press reported.

WASHINGTON The first shots in a political battle over funding for a range of federal activities rang out during a congressional subcommittee hearing on Wednesday, as Republicans and Democrats took opposing stances on a budget bill for financial regulators and other agencies.The legislation, which covers funding for the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Treasury Department, the judiciary branch and others, passed the House of Representatives Financial Services Subcommittee and now goes to the full Appropriations Committee. It then must win approval from the Republican-dominated House before being reconciled with a Senate version into a single bill for President Barack Obama to sign.Democrats at Wednesday's meeting made it clear they will press for changes at every step of the lawmaking process, saying the current bill is loaded with ideological policy ""riders"" that do not belong and that it could cripple important government work.Republicans, meanwhile, said the bill would reign in spending, make bodies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau more accountable and boost funding for important issues.""We cut funding for nearly two dozen agencies that can operate with a little less,"" said Republican Ander Crenshaw of Florida, the subcommittee chairman, adding that the cuts helped free up more money for antidrug trafficking efforts, the Small Business Administration, and the Treasury Department's Offfice of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.
In total, the bill drops funding by 6.5 percent from current levels for all agencies, including the General Services Administration and the Internal Revenue Service, which bear ""the brunt of the reduction"" because ""they are the largest agencies in the bill and both have a recent history of inappropriate behavior,"" Crenshaw said.Republicans want to shake up the IRS after a 2013 scandal in which it allegedly targeted conservative Tea Party groups.
The bill would also shave $50 million from the SEC's budget.Representative Nita Lowey, a Democrat from New York, said the lower funding in the legislation ""would allow more tax cheats to go undetected"" and thwart the SEC in protecting investors. 
""The long list of riders turns a bad bill into an example of the Republican majority's unnecessary culture war,"" she added, citing provisions to block the Federal Communications Commission's internet neutrality rule and to limit health coverage of abortions for federal employees.Calling the riders ""unnecessary, unwarranted, and unhelpful,""  the senior Democrat on the subcommittee, Jose Serrano of New York, said ""they are an effort to appease the right wing of the right wing.""

By Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Paul Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican, on Wednesday continued to withhold his support from Donald Trump for the Republican Party's presidential nomination, saying he is not ready to endorse the real estate billionaire, a political neophyte.Ryan, the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, brushed aside reports that he was ready to endorse Trump during a meeting with reporters in the Capitol. ""I haven't made a decision,"" he said, adding that he had no timetable for doing so.The 46-year-old speaker is the only member of the Republican congressional leadership who has not formally embraced the presumptive Republican nominee. Ryan is expected to chair the party's nominating convention in July in Cleveland.Ryan and Trump were, however, scheduled to speak by telephone on Wednesday evening, a spokesman for Ryan said. ""This is not an endorsement call,"" spokesman Zack Roday said.Ryan set up the call with Trump to continue discussing the party's campaign agenda, a Ryan aide said.
Trump's ascent has shaken the party establishment and raised concerns among some Republicans over whether they can unify behind him, given his harsh rhetoric and shifting policy positions in a brutal primary fight that once had 17 candidates.Ryan was asked Wednesday about Trump's comment this week that New Mexico Republican Governor Susana Martinez, who had declined to attend a Trump rally, was not doing her job. Ryan said Martinez was a ""great governor"" and ""a friend of mine,"" and said he would leave it at that.
Ryan said his staff and Trump's were in contact virtually daily.""I want this to be a sincere deliberative process,"" Ryan said. He dismissed suggestions that the Trump campaign was trying to pressure him, saying, ""I don't worry about that stuff.""The speaker faces some pressure from inside his party to smooth things over and form a united front against likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in November.
Ryan's statement earlier this month that he was not ready to support Trump was unusual and seen as an effort to keep some distance from Trump and protect Ryan's own presidential prospects for 2020.Ryan said his staff and the Trump campaign have been discussing a wide-ranging policy agenda for the campaign, covering issues from healthcare to taxes and national security.Ryan said the policy agenda on poverty will be announced in the first week of June, with more details later in the month. He said the agenda was for 2017 and would feature ""the kind of things that you can get done only with a Republican president.""

By Ginger Gibson and Jonathan Allen
| WASHINGTON/NEW YORK

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Donald Trump this week took his use of sordid accusations against Democrat Hillary Clinton to levels unprecedented in modern U.S. presidential campaigns, in the latest example of the Republican's unorthodox playbook.The presumptive Republican nominee is working to gain stronger footing and offset a big advantage Clinton is likely to have ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election: a huge campaign war chest that she and her allies intend to use to launch a barrage of attacks against him. Trump is using the same strategy he used repeatedly during the Republican nomination fight against rivals like Ted Cruz: making incendiary statements that U.S. television networks cannot resist covering, giving him hours of free media and putting his opponents on the defensive. The strategy may already be working.Trump has raised more than a few eyebrows with his latest round of attacks against Clinton. He has turned history into headlines that play like a virtual reel in the 24-hour news world of cable TV and the internet.Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said the strategy makes sense.""Clearly, she's going to have massive amounts of money,"" Lewandowski told Reuters. ""The difference is Mr. Trump has funded his campaign. What we've been able to do in this campaign cycle is to generate earned media based on Mr. Trump's ability to be a straight talker, and genuine and authentic, and I think that's what drives the news cycle.""Trump's latest salvos include a rape accusation against former President Bill Clinton dating to the 1970s and the suicide of an aide to the former president in 1993 - events that the campaign links to Hillary Clinton.An online video released by Trump has various women accusing the former president of rape or unwanted sexual advances. Trump accused Hillary Clinton of helping to silence the women. The Clintons and their supporters have dismissed the charges as baseless and politically motivated.Then, in an interview with The Washington Post, Trump suggested that the Clintons may have been involved in the 1993 death of Vince Foster, a former aide to Bill Clinton and a friend of Hillary Clinton, even though more than five investigations, including one conducted by Republican special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, concluded that Foster committed suicide in a Virginia park.
Trump was alluding to theories over the years that have been circulated in tabloid publications, in the depths of the internet and in books by the Clintons' foes.On Wednesday, Trump's campaign accidentally sent an email to a reporter at Politico revealing that the Republican plans to next attack Clinton regarding Whitewater, a real estate scandal that plagued Bill Clinton's administration. No wrongdoing by the Clintons was ever proven.The attacks have put Hillary Clinton on her back foot.Trump ""just continues to gobble news cycle after news cycle,"" said Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway, who ran the Super PACs that backed Senator Ted Cruz in the primary and aggressively attacked Trump. ""Clinton is spending less time campaigning about the future and more time explaining the past than she would probably like."" The barrage puts Clinton in a bind. So far, she has opted to ignore Trump's personal attacks and her campaign has offered general pushback. But Clinton risks the negative onslaught dragging down her standing with the public and irreversibly damaging her general election hopes.
""I played a lot of hardball in my life, but I don't envy what the Clinton campaign is up against here. Trump himself has totally changed the political dynamic,"" said Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist who supports Clinton. ""What they can't afford to do is get in the gutter with the guy. He has absolutely no morals or scruples. Getting into the gutter with him is an absolute waste of time.""Clinton's campaign and the Super PACs supporting her will not be without funds to try to combat the attacks and launch her own. At the end of April, she had $30 million in her campaign account, compared with Trump's $2 million. And the PAC supporting her, which can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money, had $46 million at the end of April - a total that is likely to grow over the summer. The PAC backing Trump is just getting off the ground.Clinton will also depend on an army of surrogates to try to combat Trump without having to respond to him herself. Trump has already proven he can dispatch opponents without spending much money by defining them to voters through aggressive appearances on news programs. 
Republican rival Jeb Bush had a more than $100 million advantage going into the primary. But Trump painted him as ""low energy"" and defined him as inept, a characterization Bush's money was never able to overcome.The PACs backing Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz spent millions assailing Trump. Trump was able to leverage extensive coverage of his campaign by the media to combat their attacks while spending little money on advertising.Trump has been proven an expert at raising attack lines that have already been settled, but insisting that questions remain. He spent years demanding that President Barack Obama produce his birth certificate, despite myriad evidence that Obama was born in Hawaii, including government records of the president's birth in Honolulu.For Trump, some of the attacks are targeted at young voters - those in their early 20s and 30s were too young to have been immersed in news about the scandals of the Clinton years.  ""You have a whole series of the population who either (a) don't know anything about it, or (b) weren't paying attention at the time,"" Lewandowski said.A Clinton ally said Trump is simply trying to distract attention from his own liabilities - such as refusing to release his tax returns and his own history of problems with women.""The more he raises these outrageous and outlandish charges,"" said U.S. Representative Xavier Becerra, of California, a Democratic leader in the House, ""the more he keeps you pedaling in a different direction.""

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Obama administration officials told U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday they would oppose new sanctions on Iran if they interfere with last year's international nuclear agreement, laying the groundwork for a potential fight over any legislation.""If legislation were to undermine the deal, by taking off the table commitments that we had put on the table, that would be a problem,"" Adam Szubin, the acting Treasury Department undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, told a House of Representatives hearing.""Certainly our allies around the world would see us taking back major chunks of the sanctions relief as bad faith,"" Szubin told a Senate Banking Committee hearing later on Wednesday.House and Senate members are drafting new sanctions measures, accusing Iran of supporting terrorism, human rights abuses and violating its international commitments by testing ballistic missiles.They want to renew the Iran Sanctions Act, a broad U.S. law imposing sanctions over Iran's nuclear and missile programs that expires at the end of 2016. Administration officials have urged Congress not to rush to renew the ISA.
Lawmakers argue that new sanctions will help send a message that Washington will take a hard line, despite the nuclear pact. Every Republican in Congress and several of President Barack Obama's fellow Democrats opposed the agreement.""I feel it's not so terrible to have Congress come up with new sanctions if we feel Iran is violating its agreements,"" said Representative Eliot Engel, top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who opposed the nuclear pact.
Szubin and Stephen Mull, the State Department's lead coordinator for implementing the nuclear deal, told lawmakers that, so far, the deal announced in July 2015 was being fully implemented. They said the administration was tightly tracking Iran's compliance.""We believe that we and our allies in the region are considerably safer,"" Mull said. Members of Congress recently accused the administration of allowing sanctions workarounds that might provide Iran direct or indirect access to the U.S. financial system.
Szubin reiterated the administration's assurances that it had no such plans.Despite the easing of nuclear sanctions under the international agreement, Tehran's hopes of rapidly ending its economic isolation have been complicated by companies' concerns that doing business with Iran might violate non-nuclear sanctions that remain in place.

WASHINGTON Legislation with bipartisan support that would revamp U.S. chemical safety law for the first time in decades is advancing in Congress, winning overwhelming passage in the House of Representatives as backers sought quick Senate action.Senate leadership aides said the timing was still being worked out for a Senate vote on the first update of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) in about 40 years.The House's 403-12 vote to pass the measure updating the regulation of toxic chemicals aided the bill's chances, with the Senate also expected to strongly embrace the bill, according to leadership aides.""By removing 40-year-old barriers and modernizing procedures, we reduce the risk to consumers. This means the chemicals and products we use every day will be safer for Americans,"" Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said.Lawmakers have complained that under current law, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been unable to effectively regulate chemicals, including those that can be found in hardware stores for home improvements.
""Under current law, it's become harder for the EPA to ban even substances that are known to cause cancer, such as asbestos,"" said Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, in calling for passage of the bill on Tuesday.According to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, ""Absent EPA action under TSCA, some states, litigants and even consumer product retailers have been increasingly taking steps to restrict certain chemicals, not always relying on objective scientific analysis to make these decisions.""
Under the bill, the government would evaluate risks posed by chemicals without considering the cost of taking action.If there are indications that a chemical's use presents an unreasonable risk, the EPA would attempt to manage the risk, under the bill. Steps could range from labeling the product to banning it.
Under the compromise bill hammered out by Republicans and Democrats, the EPA would have to consider the impact of a chemical on health and the environment, the chemical's benefits and the economic impact of regulation. (Reporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Will Dunham)"	['Paul']	[]
