WASHINGTON A recanvass of Kentucky's Democratic presidential primary results found Hillary Clinton won the contest by 1,911 votes, Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Grimes said on Thursday.Clinton's rival for the party's nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders, had requested a recount in the razor-close contest earlier this week. Grimes, in posts on Twitter, said the results of the recanvass would be certified by the state's Board of Elections on May 31.

By Harriet McLeod
| CHARLESTON, South Carolina

CHARLESTON, South Carolina Republican South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley on Wednesday signed into law a bill banning most abortions after 19 weeks of pregnancy unless the mother's life is at risk, a spokesperson told Reuters on Wednesday. The South Carolina legislature passed the bill last week, making it the 17th U.S. state to approve such a ban.A signing ceremony will take place on a date to be announced later, said Haley representative Chaney Adams. The act, proposed last year in South Carolina's Republican-controlled legislature, passed after it was stripped of exceptions for pregnancies that result from rape or incest.
The law allows abortions at the 20-week mark if the pregnancy endangers a mother's life. It also includes a second exception if severe fatal abnormalities will mean the fetus would definitely die at full-term birth. Sixteen other states have passed similar laws as conservatives have chipped away at the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision to legalize abortion. Courts have overturned the bans in three states.
""I believe that life begins at conception and every step we can take to get back to that point is important,"" the bill's sponsor, Republican Representative Wendy Nanney, told Reuters. ""In my view and many others', it's inhumane to subject that baby to pain at 20 weeks.""Critics have said the name of the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act goes against medical evidence showing that a fetus at 20 weeks cannot feel pain.
The law also removes necessary medical options in the extremely rare instance that an abortion is recommended after 19 weeks, critics said. ""We are incredibly disappointed in Governor Haley for signing HB 3114 into law today,"" Jenny Black, president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, said in a statement on Wednesday. ""This dangerous and politically-motivated measure bans abortion after 20 weeks with no exceptions for victims of rape or incest, and no consideration for a woman's individual circumstances.""

By Matt Spetalnick and Thomas Wilson
| ISE-SHIMA, Japan

ISE-SHIMA, Japan U.S. President Barack Obama disparaged U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday, saying the billionaire seeks tweets over solutions and has ""rattled""  foreign leaders with his pronouncements.Obama accused the real estate mogul and former reality TV impresario of making cavalier comments for provocative effect, and he urged all presidential candidates to take the high road in a boisterous and harsh campaign.Weighing in on the race to succeed him with his strongest broadside yet against Trump, Obama said fellow leaders from the Group of Seven nations ""are surprised by the Republican nominee"".""They are not sure how seriously to take some of his pronouncements but they are rattled by them,"" the president told a news conference on the sidelines of a G7 summit in central Japan.""For good reason, because a lot of the proposals he has made display either ignorance of world affairs or a cavalier attitude, or an interest in getting tweets and headlines, instead of actually thinking through what it is that is required to keep America safe, secure and prosperous and the world on an even keel."" Many U.S. allies fear Trump will feed insecurity in countries worried about China's growing power, embolden nationalists and authoritarians, and unravel Obama's ""pivot"" to the Asia-Pacific.     
Trump has also been accused of racism and bigotry for saying he would build a wall to keep out illegal Mexican immigrants and would temporarily ban Muslims from the United States. He has also made comments considered demeaning to women.The race between Trump on the one hand and the Democratic candidates, front-runner Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state, and Senator Bernie Sanders, for the Nov. 8 election has become increasingly bitter and personal.Trump this week took his use of accusations against Clinton to levels unprecedented in modern U.S. presidential campaigns, making incendiary statements that television networks cannot resist covering, giving him hours of free media and putting his opponents on the defensive.
Obama said it was natural for journalists in such a campaign to elevate ""every roll, blink, speed bump, conflict, trash talkin'"", but urged, instead, that candidates from both sides  stick to the issues.""Grumpiness arises where folks feel that we're not talking about issues but personalities or character."" Obama, a Democrat, issued his most extensive analysis to date of his own party's race, while refusing to take sides.
He rejected a suggestion that beating Trump would get more difficult as the two parties' conventions approach in July, a period when the Democratic victor can focus on fighting Trump instead of the fellow Democrat, adding that the Democrat battle was tough.""Arguing against your friends is more draining than arguing against political opponents,"" Obama said.He said there were no big ideological differences between Clinton, an establishment candidate who is a former First Lady and senator, and Sanders, a firebrand populist who identifies as a Democratic Socialist.The president said it was important that the race eventually end in a way ""that leaves both sides feeling proud of what they've done.""

JINHUA, China There's no masking the facts. One Chinese factory is expecting Donald Trump to beat his likely U.S. presidential rival Hillary Clinton in the popularity stakes.At the Jinhua Partytime Latex Art and Crafts Factory, a Halloween and party supply business that produces thousands of rubber and plastic masks of everyone from Osama bin Laden to Spider-Man, masks of Donald Trump and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton faces are being churned out.Sales of the two presidential candidates are at about half a million each but the factory management believes Trump will eventually run out the winner.""Even though the sales are more or less the same, I think in 2016 this mask will completely sell out,"" said factory manager Jacky Chen, indicating a Trump mask.The firm was already beginning to stockpile the Republican candidate's mask, he said.
Just like with the sales of the $4-$5 masks, Trump is now running nearly even with Clinton among likely U.S. voters ahead of the November election, a Reuters/Ipsos poll from May 11 showed. That is a big turnaround for the real estate billionaire once considered a fringe figure in the race, but now the Republican party's presumptive presidential nominee.Trump has been less than positive in his comments about China, asserting that the world's number two economy had waged ""economic war"" against the United States, and used crafty business practices to steal American jobs.
China has largely refrained from responding to Trump's barbs, but Finance Minister Lou Jiwei described him as ""an irrational type"" in an interview in April.Such issues are far removed from the Trump mask production line at the factory in Zhejiang province, south of Shanghai.
Asked if he knew whose face he was making, 43-year-old worker Liu Dahua told reporters: ""It's the president of the U.S., right?""(This version of the story has been refiled to fix spelling of Clinton's first name to ""Hillary"" instead of ""Hilary"" in first paragraph and spelling to ""Spider-Man"" instead of ""Spiderman"" in 2nd paragraph removes ""expected"" as description of candidates corrects description of Trump by removing ""de facto"" in fifth paragraph) (Reporting by Xihao Jiang and Natalie Thomas; Editing by Patrick Johnston and Robert Birsel)"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

ISE-SHIMA, Japan U.S. President Barack Obama said on Thursday he expects the Taliban to continue a strategy of violence following the appointment of a hardline leader, adding that the United States aims to uphold Afghanistan's fragile democratization and prevent its use as a base by Islamic State.  ""This continues to be an organization that sees violence as a strategy for obtaining its goals and moving its agenda forward in Afghanistan,"" said Obama, told reporters during a Group of Seven summit at Ise-Shima in central Japan.""In the short-term, we anticipate that the Taliban will continue to pursue an agenda of violence and blowing up innocent people."" ""Our goal right now is to make sure (Afghanistan's) constitution and democratic process is upheld (and) maintain the counter-terrorism platforms that we need in the region so that al Qaeda and now ISIL are not able to take root and use it as a base to attack us in the United States,"" he said, using an acronym for Islamic State.
The selection of cleric Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada as the new Taliban chief on Wednesday all but dashes Obama's hopes for opening peace talks before he leaves office, one of his top foreign policy goals, current and former U.S. defense and intelligence officials said.
Akhundzada, a conservative Islamic scholar from the Taliban's stronghold in southern Afghanistan, succeeded Mullah Akhtar Mansour four days after he was killed in a U.S. drone strike. Some U.S. officials had expressed hope that Mansour's death would eliminate an obstacle to peace negotiations between the Taliban and the government of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.

By Kim Palmer
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND Lawmakers in Ohio on Wednesday approved legislation that would legalize marijuana use for medical purposes under certain circumstances, less than a year after recreational marijuana use was soundly defeated by Ohio voters.  The bill, approved by both chambers of the state's Republican-led legislature, heads to Republican Governor John Kasich for his signature as his office said on Wednesday that he will review the bill.During the last few years, state legislatures and voters in the United States have been much more receptive to making the use of marijuana legal for medical purposes than for recreational use. Some 24 states and Washington D.C. currently allow some type of medical marijuana use while only a handful of states allow for recreational use. It remains illegal on the federal level. The Ohio legislation is more limiting than some in that it only allows patients with specific medical conditions to use an oil, edible, tincture or vapor form of marijuana prescribed by a physician licensed in the state, starting in 2017. 
""This bill is not perfect, but it's what Ohio patients need,"" Ohio Senator Kenny Yuko, a Democrat, said before his house approved the bill. ""Marijuana is not a gateway drug, but a gateway off drugs.""
Medical marijuana users would not be allowed to smoke or grow their own marijuana under the measure, which also would  create a commission responsible for regulating and licensing of all operations of the drug.In November, Ohio voters soundly rejected a measure that would have made it the first U.S. Midwestern state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana.Lawmakers from both parties voted for and against the bill on Wednesday. Some opponents of the measure have said that the qualifying list of medical conditions is too limited. 
The measure was fast-tracked to head off a possible less-restrictive medical marijuana ballot initiative in November. In a poll released in early May, 90 percent of Ohio voters supported the legalization for medical marijuana.  (Reporting by Kim Palmer in Cleveland; Editing by Michael Perry)"	['Palmer', 'Kasich']	[]

By Emily Flitter
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has fired his national political director after six weeks on the job, campaign sources said on Wednesday.Trump told staffers and supporters gathered backstage before a campaign rally in California on Wednesday that political director Rick Wiley ""should be fired"" for his handling of a fundraising deal with the Republican National Committee, according to the sources. The RNC fundraising agreement included 11 states but not Nevada, where Republicans in the state are angling for key victories in the November elections. Three sources confirmed Trump said Wiley should be fired after Nevada Republican Party Chairman Michael McDonald told Trump that Wiley was responsible for leaving Nevada out of the deal.McDonald did not return calls seeking comment. Wiley did not respond to emails, text messages and phone calls seeking comment.
The move is the latest in a tug of war between Trump's original campaign team, including press secretary Hope Hicks and  campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, and a group of professionals he brought in later to shore up support from more traditional corners of the Republican Party.The new arrivals, led by veteran strategist Paul Manafort, whom Trump hired in late March, have urged Trump to tone down some of his most provocative positions, such as his proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States.But Trump reprimanded Manafort, according to two sources familiar with the conversation, after Manafort told a gathering of RNC members at an April meeting in Florida that Trump was only ""acting"" when describing his proposed Muslim ban or his plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Manafort hired Wiley on April 13.A statement issued by the Trump campaign said Wiley had been hired on a ""short-term basis as a consultant until the campaign was running full steam"" and it thanked him for ""for helping us during this transition period.""

By Dave McKinney
| SPRINGFIELD, Ill

SPRINGFIELD, Ill Illinois took another step on Wednesday that is bound to lead nowhere in solving its strangled finances, with the Democratic-led House approving a new spending plan and Republican Governor Bruce Rauner immediately vowing to veto it, saying it was $7 billion out of balance.The fiscal 2017 budget, which passed in a 63-53 vote, allocates $14.1 billion for general funds spending against $33 billion in anticipated revenue. However, the Democrats' plan does not include billions of dollars the state automatically spends on pensions and debt payments, as well as for court-ordered social services spending under consent decrees, leading Republicans to blast the budget for needing $7.2 billion in additional revenue.The spending plan appeared destined to follow in the path of the Democrats' fiscal 2016 budget, which was vetoed by Rauner, with the exception of K-12 school funding, on the premise it was $4 billion short on revenue. That has left Illinois the only state without a complete spending plan 11 months into a fiscal year that began July 1, 2015.
The state has been relying on ongoing appropriations, stopgap funding bills and court-ordered spending, with a growing pile of unpaid bills as it limps through the fiscal year.""This is a repeat of last year on steroids,"" said House Republican Leader Jim Durkin during the budget debate.But House Majority Leader Barbara Flynn Currie said lawmakers must act to pass a budget.   
""It is unconscionable this state has failed to do its job during the current fiscal year and it would be even more unconscionable for us to leave this assembly without taking care of our responsibilities for the fiscal year to come,"" she said.The House-passed budget includes an additional $700 million to address funding inequities among K-12 school districts, most notably the cash-strapped Chicago Public Schools, which would also get an additional $100 million for pensions. The budget now moves to the Democrat-controlled Senate, where its fate was unclear.
Comptroller Leslie Munger, a Republican, warned of ""catastrophic"" results if the House budget plan is enacted, predicting the backlog of unpaid bills would more than double to $15 billion and payments to schools, hospitals and others would take as long as nine months to process. A coalition of unpaid social service agencies that sued Illinois for more than $100 million earlier this month filed an emergency motion on Wednesday asking the Cook County Court to order the state to immediately make bill payments that are more than 60 days late.

By Emily Stephenson and Steve Gorman
| ANAHEIM, Calif.

ANAHEIM, Calif. Some 100 people staged a boisterous but largely peaceful demonstration outside a Southern California rally by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, at times taunting his supporters before police moved in and arrested eight people.The activists carried signs such as ""Stop Nazi Trump"" and ""Dump Trump,"" and beat a pinata made to resemble the presumptive Republican nominee outside a convention center in Anaheim, just a few blocks from Disneyland, before they were driven from the scene by police on horseback.A spokesman for the Anaheim Police Department said seven adults and one minor were arrested on charges ranging from selling T-shirts without a permit to unlawful assembly.The arrests came one day after a Trump event in Albuquerque, New Mexico, erupted into chaos after hundreds of protesters tried to swarm the convention center where Trump spoke, knocking down barricades, waving Mexican flags and hurling rocks and bottles at police officers in riot gear. Police responded with smoke bombs and pepper spray.Albuquerque police said they made arrests both outside and inside the rally, where demonstrators continually interrupted Trump's speech. The police department's Twitter feed said officers were treated for injuries caused by thrown rocks.In a Twitter post on Wednesday, Trump called the protesters in Albuquerque ""thugs who were flying the Mexican flag.""""The rally inside was big and beautiful, but outside, criminals!"" he said.In Anaheim, police warned in advance that they would take ""swift"" action if protests got out of hand, and the roughly 150 officers and sheriffs deputies on hand may have outnumbered the protesters.   
Inside, Trump was interrupted by hecklers as he spoke, including one man who waved a Mexican flag.""Do not hurt him,"" Trump said as a man was led out of the arena. ""I say that for the television cameras. Even though he is a bad person."" LATINOS FOR TRUMP
Many of those who protested outside the arena expressed anger over Trump's views on immigration, at one point ripping apart a pinata resembling the candidate and spearing the paper-mache head on top of a flagpole with a large Mexican flag.
Police largely stood by watching the demonstration, which became tense at times when anti-Trump protesters surrounded smaller groups of his supporters. At one point a brief shoving match broke out. As Trump's campaign event neared its conclusion inside, outside a police helicopter circled overhead, ordering the throng to disperse or face arrest. Officers on horseback then drove the crowd from the scene, where several people were taken into custody for failing to disperse. Trump's appearances in the U.S. West in areas with significant Hispanic populations have drawn large protests in response to his remarks that Mexico is sending criminals and rapists to the United States, made when he launched his campaign last year.Trump's problems with Latino voters could dampen his Nov. 8 election hopes. A poll by the political research group Latino Decisions found 87 percent of registered Hispanic voters view Trump unfavorably. States like Nevada and New Mexico have growing Hispanic populations that could tip the election.
Trump's trip west came ahead of the California and New Mexico nominating contests on June 7. He also plans to hold several large fundraising events in California. It is the first high-dollar fundraising event the New York real estate mogul has held after largely self-funding his primary campaign.Mike McGetrick, one of two people carrying ""Latinos for Trump"" signs at the Anaheim rally, said he is part of a group called America First Latinos, whose website describes its members as believing in ""the rule of law, hard work and the American Dream."" He said his neighborhood in nearby Orange is ""being overrun"" by undocumented immigrants.""There are so many of them, and they're everywhere,"" said McGetrick, 62, a retired city worker. ""I can tell an illegal from a regular person just like that.""Trump supporters have been hopeful that his likely opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, will be dogged by her own problems to offset his difficulty with some populations. On Wednesday, Clinton faced renewed criticism about her use of a private email server for government business while secretary of state after a report by the State Department's inspector general said she had violated agency policies.Trump only briefly addressed the report in his appearance in Anaheim. ""Not good,"" he said. ""Inspector general's report, not good.""

By Fiona Ortiz
| CHICAGO

CHICAGO A Chicago activist sued U.S. immigration authorities on Wednesday alleging they denied renewal of her immigration status in retaliation for her political activity.Irere Unzueta, 29, who came to the United States from Mexico in 1994 when she was 6 years old, applied for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) in 2013 and was granted immigration relief despite a history of arrests at demonstrations.But when she applied last year to renew her DACA status - which allows undocumented immigrants who entered the country before they were 16 to work legally and be exempt from deportation for a two-year period - it was denied.According to the lawsuit against the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the agency cited Unzueta's civil disobedience in its explanation of the denial, saying that ""Ms. Unzueta's case raised public safety concerns.""
The denial ""punishes her for engaging in constitutionally protected, peaceful political actions,"" Mony Ruiz Velasco, a lawyer who represented Unzueta in her application for DACA, said at a news conference on Wednesday.Unzueta told reporters she has lost two job opportunities while fighting to renew her immigration status and said she brought the lawsuit because she is worried that hundreds of other students who spoke up about immigration issues could be targeted. She has never been convicted of any crime.
The media office at USCIS said they do not comment on individual cases. President Barack Obama initiated DACA in 2012, and then tried to expand it in 2014. The Supreme Court is considering challenges by a number of states to the expanded DACA and to a separate Obama program that would have granted immigration benefits to parents of children who are legally in the United States.
The DACA designation is not a path to permanent resident status but has been controversial because Obama enacted it unilaterally.Unzueta and her family participated in a wave of campaigns around the country to push for DACA. She attended high school in Chicago and graduated from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2009.The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, asks the court to find that the immigration authorities erred in denying Unzueta the renewal she sought.Although her application for immigration relief was denied, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has not initiated deportation proceedings against Unzueta."
