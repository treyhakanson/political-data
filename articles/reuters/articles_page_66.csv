| PORTSMOUTH, N.H.

PORTSMOUTH, N.H. U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, fighting to overcome setbacks and polls showing a tough path to the White House, on Saturday doubled down on his claim that the U.S. election is rigged against him.Trump challenged accusations from several women that he made unwanted sexual advances toward them. Trump spokesman Jason Miller denied a new allegation that surfaced on Saturday, saying there was ""no way"" Trump had kissed a woman without permission 20 years ago at his Florida resort.Trump told an outdoor rally in New Hampshire on Saturday that the media was sharing the accusations against him to boost Democrat Hillary Clinton and damage his own White House hopes.Trump has presented no evidence for claims he has made for months that the election could be fixed to prevent him from reaching the Oval Office. Leaders on both sides of the political spectrum worry that this rhetoric, which supporters sometimes repeat in interviews, undermines the democratic process.""It looks to me like a rigged election,"" Trump said in New Hampshire. ""The election is being rigged by corrupt media pushing completely false allegations and outright lies in an effort to elect her president.""He started the day tweeting several times that the election was being swayed by a media conspiracy. ""This election is being rigged by the media pushing false and unsubstantiated charges, and outright lies, in order to elect Crooked Hillary!"" he said in one Twitter post. He reiterated similar claims at a later rally in Bangor, Maine.         
Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, led Trump by seven percentage points in the most recent Reuters/Ipsos national opinion poll of voters. A new analysis found she was heavily favored to reach the 270 Electoral College votes needed to secure the presidency.Trump's campaign said on Saturday it had raised a total of $100 million in September, mostly from small donors but also including a $2 million monthly contribution from Trump. At the same time, the campaign squabbled with the Republican party in Ohio, a key swing state in the Nov. 8 election, whose Republican leaders have not been shy about concerns with Trump. On Saturday, Trump's Ohio state director released a letter saying that Ohio Republican Party Chairman Matt Borges ""no longer has any affiliation"" with the campaign. Borges responded that the state party had been actively helping Trump there.
Trump's speech in New Hampshire was intended to focus on a plan to end deaths caused by opioid overdoses, something he often mentions on the campaign trail. But he deviated from policy proposals to air his allegations of election-rigging and his response to new groping accusations, 24 days before the election.Trump has been fending off the accusations since the release of a 2005 video in which he was recorded bragging about making unwanted sexual advances toward women. Trump has said the boasts were merely words and he has denied each of the allegations.The latest woman to come forward, Cathy Heller, 63, of New York, told the Guardian newspaper that in or around 1997, Trump kissed her on the lips upon first meeting her during a Mother's Day brunch at his Florida estate. She told the newspaper she leaned away, then turned her head, and he kissed the side of her mouth.Reuters could not confirm the allegations by Heller, who has contributed to Clinton's campaign. The Guardian said it spoke to a relative who saw part of the interaction.
""There is no way that something like this would have happened in a public place on Mother's Day at Mr. Trump's resort,"" Miller, the Trump spokesman, said in a statement. ""It would have been the talk of Palm Beach for the past two decades.""On Saturday, Trump deemed ""crazy"" another woman, Jessica Leeds, now 74, who said he groped her on an airplane in or around 1980. He also denied allegations of unwanted contact by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Trump's show ""The Apprentice,"" who said he kissed her during a meeting about a possible job. Trump said Zervos' first cousin called her a ""huge fan of Donald Trump,"" referring to a letter the campaign released to media.Trump also told the New Hampshire crowd that he and Clinton were ""like athletes"" gearing up for the final presidential debate on Wednesday in Las Vegas, and he implied Clinton might have been on drugs during their last match-up.""I think we should take a drug test prior to the debate,"" Trump said. ""In the beginning of her last debate she was all pumped up at the beginning and at the end she was like uh, take me down.""

EDISON, N.J. U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump pledged that the United States and India would be ""best friends"" if he is elected and that he would boost intelligence sharing with India in the battle against Islamic militants.Trump spoke at an event sponsored by the Republican Hindu Coalition to raise money for victims of terrorism. It featured Bollywood-style performers who danced in colorful, traditional costumes.""If I'm elected president, the Indian and Hindu community will have a true friend in the White House, that I can guarantee you,"" said Trump, who noted that as a real estate developer he has two ""massive developments"" in India.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has developed a friendly relationship with President Barack Obama, a Democrat who wants Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, to win the Nov. 8 election.""We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism when I'm president. We will stand shoulder to shoulder with India in sharing intelligence and keeping our people safe mutually,"" said Trump. 
He called India a strategic ally and that ""we will be best friends"" if he wins the election.

By Peter Rutherford
| INCHEON, South Korea

INCHEON, South Korea LPGA chief Mike Whan says the Tour will back golf authorities no matter what decision they make about hosting the 2017 US Women's Open at a course owned by presidential nominee Donald Trump amid a storm over sexually aggressive comments he made about women.The United States Golf Association (USGA) is facing calls to move the event from Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey in nine months' time after a 2005 video surfaced in which he bragged of kissing and groping women without consent.Whan told Reuters in an interview on Saturday at the LPGA/KLPGA co-sanctioned KEB Hana Bank Championship in Incheon that he was ""lucky"" not to have to make that kind of decision.The U.S. Women's Open, the most prestigious tournament in ladies golf, is conducted by the USGA. ""In a strange way I'm lucky that the LPGA has no direct dealings with Donald Trump or Donald Trump properties,"" he said.""Like any group we have people who are political in favor of different sides. I'm not here to be a politician, I know that what the players want is that I don't get so political as to limit opportunities for women.""All I've said to the USGA is this, 'You have long since proven you support women's golf so if you tell us this is the right place to play then we're right there with you.'""
Whan took over in 2010 when the LPGA Tour was buckling from the fallout of the U.S. recession and his push for global growth has been a key factor in the circuit's resurgence.One look at his business card tells you everything you need to know about his strategy for growing the women's game -- the word ""commissioner"" emblazoned in English, Korean, Chinese and Japanese.Whan said he hoped the global flavor of the Tour's  schedule and sponsorship could help mitigate the effects of another downturn at home.
""In the world of finance we have a pretty diverse portfolio,"" he said of a tour which makes stops in China, Japan, Malaysia, Korea and Taiwan in a late season Asian swing.More than a third of the circuit's tournaments are sponsored by Asian firms or organizations.""It used to be that one U.S. economic downturn could really cripple the LPGA,"" he added. ""I'm not saying that wouldn't happen tomorrow, but generally speaking we are pretty well diversified regionally.""Whan said now that the Tour had been put on a solid footing, with 33 official money events this year compared to 23 in 2011, the task was to boost the dollar value of tournaments rather than add new ones.
""I think we need to be playing for $100 million in purse money,"" he said of future targets. ""I said that back in 2010 and people thought I was nuts, but that was when we were playing for $30 million.""Now we're play for $65 million and I think we'll get there.""The decision to add a fifth major to the annual tour schedule, the Evian Championship, was met with scorn by traditionalists and those outside the LPGA but Whan said it would be a mistake to be stuck in the past.""Sports that are unwilling to change because of history and tradition become historic and traditional,"" he added. ""If we just want golf to be historic and traditional and not move forward, then we would have a real problem."" (Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)"

By Maurice Tamman
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK After a brutal week for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Democrat Hillary Clinton maintained a substantial projected advantage in the race to win the Electoral College and claim the U.S. presidency, according to the latest results from the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project released on Saturday.If the election were held this week, the project estimates that Clinton's odds of securing the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency at more than 95 percent, and by a margin of 118 Electoral College votes. It is the second week in a row that the project has estimated her odds so high.__________________________STATES OF THE NATIONCheck out the state-by-state breakdown and run your own scenarios based on voter turnout___________________________
The results mirror other Electoral College projections, some of which estimate Clinton's chance of winning at around 90 percent.
For the Trump campaign there are a handful of states the Republican candidate must win if he is to cobble together enough states to win the White House.Among them is Florida, but numerous recent visits to the Sunshine State by Trump and his vice-presidential running mate Mike Pence did little to dent Clinton's advantage in the contest for the state's 29 Electoral College votes. She leads by 6 percentage points, about the same lead she enjoyed last week.Still, the race tightened in Ohio, another important state for Trump. Both Ohio and Nevada were leaning toward Clinton last week but are now toss-ups.
However, Clinton's support grew in North Carolina and Colorado, both of which moved from toss-ups to leaning Clinton.In the last week, the Trump campaign struggled to respond to allegations from several women that Trump had groped them or made unwanted sexual advances over several decades. Trump said the reports were lies and part of a media conspiracy to defeat him.All of the allegations came after The Washington Post disclosed a video from 2005 of Trump describing how he tried to seduce a married woman and bragged in vulgar terms how his celebrity allowed him to kiss and grope women without permission.The accusations overshadowed what might otherwise have been a difficult week for Clinton. Her campaign manager's email account was apparently hacked and thousands of his emails were released by Wikileaks. U.S. officials say the Russian government sanctioned the electronic break-in.
The emails have been trickling out for two weeks. Included in the hacked emails were undisputed comments that Clinton made to banks and big business in a 2014 speech. In those comments, Clinton said she supports open trade and open borders, and takes a conciliatory approach to Wall Street, both positions she later backed away from.Since that release, waves of other emails have been released, among which were some that suggested Clinton had inappropriately received questions in advance of a debate with Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primaries.Without Trump's own woes, the Clinton emails may well have become the central issue in the campaign. Yet with just over three weeks to go until the Nov. 8 election, Trump does not have much time to turn the race around.According to the project, Trump trails by double-digits among women and all minority groups. Among black voters he trails by nearly 70 points. To a large extent his support is almost entirely dependent on white voters. And while Trump's support among white men is strong, among white women his lead is negligible. (Reporting by Maurice Tamman; Editing by Reg Chua and Leslie Adler)"

By Steve Holland
| CHARLOTTE, N.C.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's campaign rallies have turned into eruptions of barely contained emotions from his impassioned followers, who urge him to fight on despite a series of gut punches that have put his chances of winning in doubt.With the Nov. 8 election now only weeks away and polls turning against him, Trump is spending precious time in campaign speeches defending himself from accusations from several women who say he made unwanted sexual advances toward them.What he would do if elected is covered, but much of his speeches are spent belittling his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. He also accuses the U.S. news media of a plot to bring him down, and charges that the women who have made the accusations against him might be doing it for a taste of fame.Opinion polls show a gloomy picture for Trump. A week after a video surfaced of him bragging in lewd terms about groping women, the latest Reuters-Ipsos poll on Friday showed Clinton up, with 44 percent to Trump's 37 percent.And the crowds have gotten more protective of their hero. One woman at a rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, on Thursday wore a homemade T-shirt that said ""Trump Can Grab My,"" with an arrow pointing to her crotch.On Friday in Greensboro, North Carolina, a man wearing a ""Gays for Trump"" shirt punched a protester who held up an upside down American flag. Both were ejected.Trump's message has gotten through to his supporters in a big way about Clinton, who Trump calls a criminal for her handling of classified information as secretary of state. ""She would be the most dishonest and corrupt ever elected to high office,"" he said.'SO JADED ALREADY'

A crowd of young voters had a ready response when he brought up Clinton at an event in Columbus, Ohio, on Thursday.""Lock her up!"" they chanted, mimicking the lines voiced by older voters at other events.Trump could only smile and shake his head. ""So young and so jaded already,"" he said.The New York businessman feeds off the energy generated by crowds that pack his rallies by the thousands. But he is easily distracted, lurching from topic to topic based on whatever happens to sprint to mind.
On Wednesday in Lakeland, Florida, Trump jumped from bashing the news media as ""the most dishonest people you'll ever see,"" to tout his performance at a debate in St. Louis on Sunday - ""which I won big league"" - to Clinton's stroll across the stage in front of him at that event.""And the papers said I invaded her space,"" he said. ""Believe me, the last space I want to invade is hers.""There are moments of levity. A woman who recovered from a brief fainting spell in the heat of Lakeland was pointed out by Trump.""That woman was out cold and now she is recovered -- a little ding to the head,"" he said, approvingly.
Trump can form an attack line against Clinton out of pretty much anything that springs to mind.Venting about Chinese trade practices before a raucous crowd of perhaps 20,000 in Cincinnati on Thursday night, Trump  suddenly imagined how China might treat Clinton given her bout of pneumonia a month ago, which had caused her to nearly collapse at an event in New York.""If she goes down in Tiananmen Square, they'll just leave her,"" he said. ""They're tough people.""Trump's crowds sometimes get agitated.Many of his supporters are upset at the news media, whipped into a frenzy by both Trump and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who in Cincinnati introduced Trump by condemning ""the insanity of the media, the insanity of the way they cover him.""Upon entering the arena, Trump's traveling press corps was booed by thousands of people who chanted ""tell the truth."" Trump boosters near the media work area repeatedly cursed and taunted reporters.""When are you all going to be ashamed of yourselves?"" one man shouted. ""Lower than Congress -- that's what your approval rating is."" (Reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Will Dunham)"

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama met on Friday with his national security team to discuss the fight against Islamic State and the war in Syria, the White House said.Reuters had reported that in the meeting Obama and his advisers would consider military and other options in Syria as Syrian and Russian aircraft continue to pummel the city of Aleppo and other targets, U.S. officials said.U.S. officials said they considered it unlikely that Obama would order U.S. air strikes on Syrian government targets, and they stressed that he might not make any decisions at the National Security Council meeting.A readout of the meeting released by the White House noted that the United States had broken off bilateral talks with Russia on reaching a ceasefire in Syria. It said Obama directed his team to continue multilateral talks with ""key nations"" to seek a diplomatic resolution to the civil war.
The brief summary made no mention of other U.S. options in Syria.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will return to Syria talks on Saturday, three weeks after the failure of their painstakingly drafted ceasefire.
Kerry has pointedly avoided new bilateral negotiations with Lavrov, and his invitation to the Turkish, Saudi, Qatari and Iranian foreign ministers to join them for talks in Lausanne, Switzerland, will broaden the discussion to include the most powerful backers of Syria's government and rebels.
Pressure is rising for a halt to a ferocious, three-week-old Syrian government offensive to capture the rebel-held eastern zone of Aleppo, where the United Nations says 275,000 civilians still live and 8,000 rebels are holding out against Syrian, Russian and Iranian-backed forces.

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. A state judge in North Carolina gave residents in counties hit hard by Hurricane Matthew five extra days to register to vote after Democrats sued to get an extension to Friday's deadline, while a federal judge ordered an extension in one Georgia county.The Democratic Party in North Carolina challenged the state election board's refusal to extend the cutoff date, saying in its suit that thousands of people would have been deprived of their fundamental right to vote in the Nov. 8 election if Friday's deadline was not extended by at least five days. The judge ordered an extension to next Wednesday in 36 counties, a lawyer for the state Democratic Party said on Twitter.""This ruling will ensure that those communities who have suffered from the devastating flooding brought on by Hurricane Matthew have the grace period that they need in order to exercise their right to vote and make their voices heard in this critical election,"" party officials said.Twenty-four people have died in North Carolina and thousands have been forced from their homes in the eastern and central parts of the state due to record flooding in Matthew's aftermath. 
North Carolina is a battleground state in the presidential election and could play a pivotal role in the race between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump.State officials said this week they would not extend the regular deadline to register to vote, but allowances would be made for forms delayed by mail delivery. Those who miss the deadline can still register and vote on the same day during the statewide early voting period from Oct. 20 through Nov. 5.The state has a Republican governor, Pat McCrory, who faces a tough contest for re-election.
The state's Republican Party opposed any extension.""It is clear that North Carolina Democrats, who have been dominated in voter registration by Republicans, want to use a horrific natural disaster to change the rules in the middle of the game,"" state Republican Chairman Robin Hayes said in a statement.
In Georgia, U.S. District Judge William Moore ordered the voter registration deadline extended until Tuesday in Chatham County, which includes the city of Savannah. The judge said the administrative difficulties of doing so ""pale in comparison to the physical, emotional and financial strain Chatham County residents faced in the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew.""A federal judge on Wednesday gave residents in Florida six extra days to register to vote after that state's Democratic Party sued for more time due to Matthew.South Carolina extended its registration deadline due to Matthew from Oct. 7 to Oct. 11.

By Matt Spetalnick and Sarah Marsh
| WASHINGTON/HAVANA

WASHINGTON/HAVANA Americans traveling to Cuba will be allowed to bring home more of the communist-ruled island's coveted cigars and rum under new measures announced by the U.S. government on Friday to further ease trade, travel and financial restrictions that have been in place for decades.Cuba welcomed the steps, part of President Barack Obama's effort to make his historic opening to Cuba ""irreversible"" by the time he leaves office in January, but said they did not go far enough.The latest in a series of new rules since the former Cold War foes began normalizing relations in 2014 will allow Cubans to buy certain U.S. consumer goods online, open the door for Cuban pharmaceutical companies to do business in the United States and let Cubans and Americans do joint medical research.For American travelers, the biggest change is the removal of limits on the amount of rum and cigars they can pack in their luggage, strictly for personal use.""You can now celebrate with Cuban rum and Cuban cigars,"" U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice quipped as she laid out the policy changes in a speech to a Washington think tank.U.S. law still bans general tourism to Cuba, but the administration has used previous regulatory packages to make it easier for Americans to visit the island under 12 officially authorized categories.The latest measures are part of an executive order on Cuba through which Obama seeks to sidestep the Republican-controlled Congress, which has resisted his call to lift Washington's economic embargo after more than 50 years. Republican critics say Obama is making too many concessions to Cuba for too little in return, especially on human rights issues. ""After two years of President Obama's Cuba policy, the Castro regime has made out like bandits,"" said U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American lawmaker from Florida.
The steps allow Cuban pharmaceutical companies to apply for U.S. regulatory approval, let U.S. firms improve Cuban infrastructure for humanitarian purposes and authorize them to provide safety-related aircraft services in Cuba, where U.S. airlines are beginning regularly scheduled flights.Also under the new rules, after docking in Cuba, some foreign ships carrying certain cargo will be permitted to travel directly to U.S. ports to load or unload freight. Until now, such vessels have been required to wait 180 days, a restriction that Cuban officials say hinders their import export trade.Josefina Vidal, the Cuban Foreign Ministry's chief of U.S. affairs, told a news conference in Havana the measures were ""positive but of a very limited nature"".MAKING THE OPENING ""IRREVERSIBLE""

""Today, I approved a Presidential Policy Directive that takes another major step forward in our efforts to normalize relations with Cuba,"" Obama said in a statement.Less than a month before the Nov. 8 presidential election, Obama said his goal was to ""make our opening to Cuba irreversible.""The latest package, the administration's sixth, is likely to be the ""last significant tranche of changes"" during Obama's tenure, said a senior official, who asked not to be named.Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton backs the policy of rapprochement with Havana. Republican Donald Trump has vowed to roll back Obama's executive actions.
Vidal criticized Obama's directive for making it clear the U.S. aimed to ""promote change in Cuba's economic, political and social system"", failing to respect its sovereignty.In March, Obama made the first visit to Havana by a U.S. president in 88 years. His trip was made possible by his breakthrough agreement with Cuban President Raul Castro in December 2014 to cast aside decades of hostility that began soon after Cuba's 1959 revolution.Since the opening, Obama has repeatedly used his executive powers to relax trade and travel restrictions, while pushing Cuba to accelerate market-style reforms and boost political and economic freedom.""The changes announced to Cuba regulations are, by definition, significant because they are new,"" said John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council. ""Whether they will be relevant depends upon the government of Cuba's willingness to permit United States companies and institutions to engage.""""This new directive consolidates and builds upon the changes we've already made,"" Obama said. He added, however, that ""challenges remain - and very real differences between our governments persist on issues of democracy and human rights.""At the same time, the U.S. embargo against Cuba has remained in place, a major irritant in relations. Only Congress can lift the embargo, and the Republican leadership is not expected to allow such a move anytime soon.

By Jonathan Allen
| SEATTLE, Wash.

SEATTLE, Wash. Hacked emails published by Wikileaks this week appear to show Qatar pledging to donate $1 million to Hillary Clinton's family's charitable foundation, despite her promise to curb new donations by foreign governments while U.S. secretary of state.In an email from 2012, a senior official from the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation informs colleagues that a planned donation by Qatar's government to mark Bill Clinton's birthday came up in a meeting he had with the Gulf state's ambassador in Washington.The ambassador said that he asked ""to see WJC 'for five minutes' in NYC, to present $1 million check that Qatar promised for WJC's birthday in 2011,"" Amitabh Desai, the foundation official, writes in his email, using the former U.S. president's initials. Hillary Clinton, who is the Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, served as secretary of state from 2009 until 2013.The hacked email is among thousands published over the last week by the pro-transparency group Wikileaks from the account of John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. Clinton's campaign has been embarrassed by this and similar recent hacking attacks on other Democratic Party officials, some of which appear to show Clinton and her aides saying things in private that contradict their public positions. Her spokesmen have not disputed the authenticity of the hacked emails. 
The emails released by Wikileaks do not appear to confirm whether Qatar gave the promised $1 million, although the foundation's website lists the State of Qatar as having given at least that amount. There is no date listed for the donation. A spokesman for the foundation declined to confirm the donation.Reuters could not rule out the possibility the $1 million was intended as a birthday present for Clinton personally, not for the foundation. His spokesman did not respond to questions.Hillary Clinton promised the U.S. government that while she served as secretary of state the foundation would not accept new funding from foreign governments without seeking clearance from the State Department's ethics office. The agreement was designed to dispel concerns that U.S. foreign policy could be swayed by donations to the foundation, which is known for its work on reducing the cost of HIV medicine in sub-Saharan Africa. Clinton's Republican rival in the presidential election, Donald Trump, has seized on the foundation for political attacks, calling it a front for corruption. Clinton's campaign dismisses this as a political smear. 
The State Department has said it cannot cite any instances of its ethics officials reviewing or approving new donations from foreign governments to the foundation while Clinton served as the country's top diplomat from 2009 until 2013. ""You would need to ask the Foundation whether there were additional matters that it should have submitted for State Department review,"" the department said in a statement.The ethics agreement allowed foreign governments that already supported foundation projects to continue while Clinton was at the State Department. However, if one of those governments wanted to ""increase materially its commitment,"" then the foundation was required to ask the department first.
Craig Minassian, a foundation spokesman, declined to confirm if Qatar gave the $1 million described in the 2012 email. Even if it had, he said he questioned whether the money would be considered a ""material increase."" He said Qatar has been donating since 2002, and that some of those donations have been greater than $1 million.Qatar's embassy in Washington did not respond to questions. A spokesman for Clinton, who was campaigning in Seattle on Friday, also did not resond to questions.Last year, Reuters found that at least seven other foreign governments made new donations to the foundation without the State Department being informed, partly, foundation officials said, because of ""oversights."" President Barack Obama is campaigning for Clinton to be elected his successor, and the White House has repeatedly declined to discuss the breaches of the agreement Clinton signed with Obama's administration.
