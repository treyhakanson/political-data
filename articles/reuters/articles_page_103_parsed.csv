By Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Critics of a plan for the U.S. government to cede control of the Internet's technical management to other countries might succeed in delaying such a move in Congress, a senior lawmaker said on Tuesday.Senator John Thune, a senior Republican from South Dakota, told reporters lawmakers are ""trying to work out ... what would be effective in terms of slowing this.""The U.S. Commerce Department oversees the Internet's management largely because it was invented in the United States.Some Republican politicians, including Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, want to block the handover to global stakeholders, such as businesses, tech experts and public interest advocates.Opponents of the transition said it could stifle online freedom by giving voting rights to authoritarian governments.
Tech companies, technical experts and academics have said the transition is overdue and necessary to keep the Internet open and globally oriented, and that the proposal includes safeguards against any potential abuse by any one country.The plan to transfer oversight of the nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, is set to occur on Oct. 1, unless Congress votes to block the handover. The California-based corporation operates the database for domain names such as .com and .net and their corresponding numeric addresses that allow computers to connect.  
The Obama administration approved the transition plan in June.Thune said he would expect language delaying the change to be in a bill to fund the government starting Oct. 1. He expects congressional leaders to finish writing the bill next week.Both houses of the Republican-controlled Congress would then have to vote on the bill and President Barack Obama, a Democrat, would have to sign it for it to become law.
A leading Senate Democrat, however, scoffed at the proposed Internet provision. ""Can Ted Cruz and Republicans dream up any more obscure, irrelevant issues to stop the business of the American government?"" asked Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat.There are other outstanding government funding issues also being negotiated by lawmakers, including how much spending should be committed to fighting the Zika virus.

| WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory has weathered negative headlines as jobs, conventions and musical performances were canceled in his state this year to protest a law deemed discriminatory against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.But news that the Southern state was being stripped of hosting two rounds of the nationally popular ""March Madness"" Division I men's college basketball tournament next spring could prove the law's most damaging fallout yet for the Republican seeking re-election in November, political experts said on Tuesday.""There's one thing you don't do in North Carolina. That is mess with basketball, particularly college basketball,"" said  Michael Bitzer, a political scientist at Catawba College in Salisbury.In addition to the tournament, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) announced on Monday it would relocate six other championship sporting events from North Carolina for the 2016-17 season.NCAA President Mark Emmert said the move was a ""proverbial no-brainer"" after North Carolina in March became the only U.S. state to require transgender people to use bathrooms in government buildings and public schools that correspond with the sex listed on their birth certificate.The Republican-backed law, known as House Bill 2 or H.B. 2, also blocked local government measures aimed at protecting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people from discrimination.
McCrory signed the measure into law and has continued to defend it as he campaigns for a second four-year term. Several recent opinion polls show him trailing his Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Roy Cooper, who has criticized the incumbent for backing the law despite mounting economic losses.In July, the National Basketball Association yanked its 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte over objections to H.B. 2.The NCAA's decision will not help McCrory's re-election chances, said Steven Greene, a political science professor at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, the state capital.
""He's going to suffer from this the most,"" Greene said in a phone interview, explaining that most of the Republican state legislators associated with the law represent districts drawn so that Republicans have a good chance of winning elections.Responding on Tuesday to the NCAA's move, McCrory called for a halt to ""economic threats or political retaliation"" while nearly two dozen states challenge an Obama administration policy that calls for public schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice.""The issue of redefining gender and basic norms of privacy will be resolved in the near future in the United States court system for not only North Carolina, but the entire nation,"" the governor said in a statement.
Around North Carolina, residents and local officials bemoaned the loss of championship events. Polls have shown most voters think the law is hurting the state, which has hosted more Division I men's basketball tournament games than any other.""That's part of North Carolina's heart right there,"" said Cindy Clodfelter, 62, a retired school counselor in Winston-Salem. ""Anything that messes with my sports, I don't like it.""The mayor of Cary - a town which was to host championship events in women's soccer, men's and women's tennis, women's lacrosse and baseball, but lost all of them to this week's NCAA decision - said it was time for state lawmakers to re-evaluate the law.McCrory ""seems to be doubling down,"" said Mayor Harold Weinbrecht Jr. ""It will say a lot about our state if he wins or if he loses.""

By Lisa Lambert
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A House of Representatives panel on Tuesday approved a proposal to revamp the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, after a hearing where lawmakers verbally tussled over rules enacted in the aftermath of the 2007-09 financial crisis.The Financial Services Committee voted to send the bill, introduced this summer by committee chairman, Republican Jeb Hensarling, to the full House to consider. No Democrat on the committee voted for the measure, which would allow banks to choose between complying with Dodd-Frank or meeting tougher capital requirements.It would also reorganize the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a watchdog created through Dodd-Frank that last week penalized Wells Fargo for creating millions of fake accounts under customers' names.The 2010 Dodd-Frank law, passed in the wake of the financial crisis, has drawn the ire of most banks and Republicans in Congress. They have said Congress went too far in trying to clamp down on Wall Street and the law imposes burdensome requirements and gives regulators too much power.
The CPFB has been a particular target for Republicans, who do not like that it is governed by a single director and say it reaches beyond its authority in enforcement.During the hearing, Democrats cited the Wells case, where the CFPB levied its largest-ever fine of $100 million, criticizing the panel's Republican majority.Democrats said that without Dodd-Frank the U.S. government would have had no tools to fight the widespread fraud, which led to the firing of 5,300 Wells employees.
""I am particularly disturbed that this bill would take away the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's ability to penalize companies for practices that are abusive to consumers,"" said New York's Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat, echoing many in her party. ""The chairman's bill, strips...from the CFPB its authority to punish abusive conduct, which means Wells Fargo would have gotten off even easier.""Meanwhile, Randy Neugebauer, the Texas Republican who has advocated creating a five-member commission to govern the CFPB, said the bureau has not been politically neutral and is not transparent.
""I remain concerned that many bureau actions demonstrate regulatory paternalism that assumes the American consumer doesn't know how to make choices for themselves,"" he said at the hearing.Corresponding legislation has not been introduced in the Senate, and Obama would be unlikely to sign the bill even both chambers of the Republican-led Congress passed it. Dodd-Frank is one of the Democratic president's signature pieces of legislation. (Reporting by Lisa Lambert; Editing by Peter Cooney and David Gregorio)"	['Obama']	[]

By Deborah M. Todd
| SAN FRANCISCO

SAN FRANCISCO LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman said on Tuesday that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump would have a ""terrifying"" effect on domestic and foreign policy if elected.The comments came one day after Hoffman published an article on Medium.com pledging support to a CrowdPac crowdfunding campaign that promises to donate to veterans causes if Trump releases his tax returns. Hoffman said in his article that he will match five times the crowdfunded amount to donate up to $5 million. The campaign has raised more than $90,000.
Hoffman told a crowd at TechCrunch Disrupt 2016 in San Francisco that he was ""in denial"" about the possibility of a Trump presidency but encouraged by efforts to hold the candidate accountable. Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Trump is facing criticism for not releasing tax returns, a political practice that is not required by law but has been done by every White House nominee since 1973. His campaign last week released 10 years of returns for vice presidential nominee Mike Pence and repeated a pledge that Trump would release his own returns once the government completes an audit.""When I saw the campaign ... I said that's exactly the right way to make this message, a message in support of folks who have given great service to our country. If Donald Trump is as concerned with making America great as he says he is he should care about veterans,"" Hoffman said.

LONDON The U.S. economy could be $1 trillion smaller than otherwise expected in 2021 if Republican candidate Donald Trump wins the presidential election in November, economics research firm Oxford Economics said on Tuesday.While the firm said Trump's policies - including more protectionist trade measures, tax cuts and mass deportation of illegal immigrants - may be watered down in negotiations with Congress, they could have ""adverse"" consequences. ""Should Mr. Trump prove more successful in achieving adoption of his policies, the consequences could be far-reaching - knocking 5 percent off the level of U.S. GDP relative to baseline and undermining the anticipated recovery in global growth,"" it said.Oxford Economics describes itself as an independent global advisory firm. It is headquartered in Oxford, England, but has offices around the world, including in Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Washington.The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the research. At a campaign event in Clive, Iowa, on Tuesday, however, Trump reasserted that he would grow the U.S. economy. 
He vowed to revive the country's manufacturing sector by preventing U.S. companies such as Apple Inc from making products overseas, renegotiating global trade accords and slashing federal taxes and regulations.""We're going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans,"" Trump said.Under its baseline scenario, Oxford Economics expects U.S.  gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced in the economy, to grow at a fairly constant rate of around 2 percent from 2017, reaching $18.5 trillion in 2021.
But if Trump is elected and succeeds in implementing his policies, it predicts growth would slow significantly, falling near zero in 2019, and reducing overall GDP to $17.5 trillion. Oxford Economics said its baseline scenario assumes Trump's Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton triumphs in the Nov. 8 vote and a split Congress emerges - between a Republican U.S. House of Representatives and a Democratic U.S. Senate - which results largely in a continuation of current policies.
Trump would face challenges winning the backing of Congress for all his policies, and some economists argue that looser tax policy could actually help boost economic growth.The latest opinion polls show Clinton, the former secretary of state, ahead, but her lead has slipped in recent weeks.

WASHINGTON The Democratic leaders of the U.S. Senate said on Tuesday they expected the chamber would vote to override President Barack Obama's promised veto of a bill allowing relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia.It would be the first override of an Obama veto since he took office in January 2009.The ""Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act,"" known as JASTA, would remove sovereign immunity, preventing lawsuits against governments, for countries found to be involved in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.Fifteen of the Sept. 11 hijackers who crashed airliners in the 2001 attacks were Saudi nationals. The Saudi government, which strongly denies responsibility, has lobbied against the bill.
But some members of Congress have become increasingly restive about relations with Saudi Arabia, long an important player in U.S. Middle East policy.Harry Reid, the Senate's Democratic leader, said he supported the measure. ""They're not one of my favorite countries,"" he said of the Saudis.
Richard Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said, ""We're all on the record supporting it, so at this point I think it's a heavy lift for the president to have his veto sustained.""A White House spokesman said in a briefing on Tuesday it had received the bill, but did not offer updates about timing of a veto. The Constitution gives the president 10 days after receiving a bill to veto it before it automatically becomes law.

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama's advisers would recommend he veto a bill in the House of Representatives that prohibits use of funds to transfer individuals detained at the Guantanamo Bay military prison to the United States or any foreign country, the White House said on Tuesday. The bill was introduced in the House and is making its way through Congress. It faces a tough battle in the Senate. Operation of the prison ""weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists,"" the White House said in a release.

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON American intelligence agencies are concerned about reports that foreign governments may be attempting to undermine the Nov. 8  U.S. elections through cyber attacks, Admiral Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, said on Tuesday.""We continue to be actively concerned,"" Rogers told a Senate hearing, responding to a question from Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.Marcel Lettre, Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, testified that the government is taking any such activities ""quite seriously"" and said an ""aggressive investigation"" is under way.McCain noted that one of the two states in which media reports said there was evidence of attempted Russian hacking was his home state, Arizona.Some analysts have said Arizona, which recently has been reliably Republican in presidential elections, could be tilting more toward the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, this year. McCain, a Republican, himself is in a tougher than usual re-election fight.
Rogers said he could not provide specifics about spy agencies' current assessment of the alleged hacking in a public setting. But he added, ""I will say this, that it continues to be an issue of great focus ... for the foreign intelligence community, attempting to generate insights into what foreign nations are doing in this area.""Under further questioning, Rogers declined to characterize the activity as by a foreign nation-state.
Lettre said the government would adopt a policy for dealing with any such activity once it had the results of the investigation.""The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security has an aggressive investigation underway,"" Lettre said.U.S. security officials have said that, starting last year, hackers infiltrated computers of the Democratic National Committee, Clinton's presidential campaign and her party's congressional fundraising committee.
U.S. officials said they have concluded that Russia or its proxies were responsible, leading to calls by some Democrats and cyber security officials for the Obama administration to blame Russia publicly.Kremlin officials have dismissed the allegations as absurd, but there is anxiety in Washington over the possibility that a foreign power might be using hacked information to meddle in the November elections.

By Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON It was classic Hillary Clinton, ignoring medical advice and attending a ceremony on a sultry New York City day while battling pneumonia - a decision ex-aides and other associates speculated was rooted in her longstanding desire to prove that women can compete in the male-dominated world of politics.The move backfired on the famously stoic Democratic presidential candidate after she had to leave Sunday's September. 11 remembrance early and was caught on camera buckling from dehydration as she was helped into a van. Clinton, 68, has since acknowledged she went too far in trying to soldier on with a jam-packed schedule.Daniel Scherb, a South Bend, Indiana, cardiologist interviewed by Reuters, who was not privy to Clinton's medical records, said pneumonia can leave a patient ""feeling blah for seven to 10 days"" under the best of circumstances and, at worst, ""people can die from it.""Former subordinates who are fiercely loyal to Clinton said there are plenty of instances in which she drove herself remarkably hard as first lady from 1993-2001, as a U.S. senator from 2001-2009 and as U.S. secretary of state from 2009-2013.In her first year at the State Department in 2009, she traveled abroad extensively shortly after undergoing surgery for a broken arm.One retired ambassador said Clinton sees herself as part of a generation of women who had to work extra hard to overcome barriers to female advancement. The ambassador describes this as part of an ethos that ""you could never be weaker than a man.""At the same time, the ambassador blamed Clinton's aides in part for allowing her to put herself into difficult situations.
'A DIFFERENT LENS'
At an event in Congo after breaking her arm, Clinton snapped at someone who posed a question she disliked, the ambassador recalled. While the question may have been translated into English incorrectly, the ambassador said Clinton also was clearly exhausted.""It's not necessarily that she is running roughshod over the advice of her staff. Her staff doesn't seem to take very good care of her,"" the ambassador said.Working to defeat Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, 70, on the rough-and-tumble campaign trail, Clinton has said she is held to a different standard.""Women are seen through a different lens,"" Clinton told Humans of New York, a group organized around a project to photograph and catalog stories of New Yorkers.
""I've learned that I can't be quite so passionate in my presentation,"" she said, adding, ""I love to wave my arms, but apparently that's a little bit scary to people. And I can't yell too much. It comes across as 'too loud' or 'too shrill' or 'too this' or 'too that,'"" even though those attending her rallies ""are loving it.""In all her roles, including as President Bill Clinton's healthcare chief and a two-time presidential candidate, Clinton has been known as an almost unstoppable, detail-oriented policy wonk.""Her constant work, internal in meetings or external on Capitol Hill, was virtually incomprehensible,"" said David Dreyer, a White House deputy communications director during Bill Clinton's first term.Dreyer, who said he had a ""front row seat"" to the healthcare reform fight that Hillary Clinton spearheaded as first lady, said she is ""wired"" to always be fully prepared and compelled to public service.
'CAN'T-WIN SITUATION'
Three other people, one close to Clinton when she was secretary of state and as a presidential candidate, said efforts to persuade her to temper her travel and appearance schedule can go nowhere because she insists it is expected of her.One, a prominent former official who has advised Clinton on foreign policy issues, said: ""She pushes herself so hard because she's convinced that only she can do what needs to be done, and that's compounded by a very small inner circle that in some cases doesn't like to contradict or confront her, and as a result just ends up encouraging this compulsion.""Matt Bennett, who served as deputy assistant for intergovernmental affairs in Bill Clinton's second presidential term, said Hillary Clinton is ""in a can't-win situation here."" Noting competing, unsubstantiated attacks from Trump and his supporters about her health versus criticisms that she does not know how to pace herself, ""Either she is frail or reckless with her health.""Bennett added, ""I don't view her as disregarding medical advice"" over past blood clots, a fall that caused a concussion and other maladies. ""But I do think she's super tough.""Bennett, now a vice president at the Third Way think tank, said the increasingly frantic pace of campaigning for the White House has pressed candidates to the limit.As an aide to retired General Wesley Clark while he unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004, Bennett noted that Clark would constantly remark about the rigors of the campaign. ""He was shot multiple times in Vietnam and went through (elite Army) Ranger training and he's saying this is really tough running for president.""

9	9	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-ryan-idUSKCN11J14A	Paul Ryan's challenges will not start until after Nov. 8 election	"


By Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan is expected to cruise to re-election in his Wisconsin congressional district on Nov. 8, the day before his real political problems are likely to start.That is when Ryan will know the shape of the new House of Representatives. If, as some analysts foresee, it becomes even more conservative than it is now, Ryan's difficulties in managing the lower chamber of Congress could worsen.For the highest-ranking elected U.S. Republican, that could spell trouble as the former vice presidential nominee looks ahead to a possible presidential run in 2020.Some staunch House conservatives, questioning Ryan's commitment to them and their agenda, are looking less kindly on the idea of re-electing him as speaker early next year.But his real test, assuming he retains the speaker's gavel, would be getting legislative results with a more conservative House. Compounding that could be the U.S. Senate switching to Democratic from Republican control and possibly a Democratic president, Hillary Clinton, if she beats Republican Donald Trump in the November election.""Next year, almost no matter what, is going to be a very tough one for Paul Ryan,"" said political scientist Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute think tank.The 2016 election results could cast a shadow over Ryan's presidential ambitions in 2020 and 2024, assuming he harbors them. ""It may well be that he decides it's just not worth it, partly given what he sees within his own party,"" Ornstein said.Ryan's aides were reluctant on Monday to discuss the possible challenges of the next Congress.
""The focus over the next 57 days is defending and strengthening our House majority. We are in a good position,""  said Ryan's political spokesman, Zack Roday.SMALLER, MORE CONSERVATIVE CAUCUS?
Republicans hold 246 of the 435 House seats, their biggest majority in decades. But analysts expect the party will lose seats in November, especially if Trump hurts fellow Republicans.
House members serve two-year terms and most are easily re-elected. The political prediction newsletter ""Sabato's Crystal Ball"" has tagged only 16 races as too close to call. Ten of those are currently held by moderates or pragmatists who have been fairly reliable supporters of legislation backed by Republican leaders including Ryan. Five of the 10 are retiring from the House.If Trump's performance damages candidates down the ticket, moderates may bear the brunt. The result could be a smaller House Republican majority more dominated by politically secure conservatives of the sort who have in recent years defied Ryan on some legislation.""A shrinking GOP conference is no doubt going to be more conservative in the new Congress, raising the challenge for Speaker Ryan to form majorities with a slimmer and more conservative rank and file,"" said Sarah Binder, professor of political science at George Washington University.If a number of moderates lose their seats, while most conservatives hold theirs, ""then the House Freedom Caucus becomes more powerful,"" said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of ""Sabato's Crystal Ball.""
The Freedom Caucus is the House's most conservative bloc, with about 40 members. It helped eject Ryan's predecessor, John Boehner, a year ago, leading to Ryan's election as speaker.The Freedom Caucus initially welcomed Ryan, a budget and fiscal policy specialist seen as more willing to listen to their agenda. But some Freedom Caucus members are unhappy with him since one of their members, Representative Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, lost a primary election last month.Ryan could have done more to help Huelskamp, some critics said. ""There was huge disappointment in that,"" said Representative John Fleming, a Freedom Caucus member from Louisiana who is running for the U.S. Senate in November.The Huelskamp fallout has driven speculation that some conservatives who previously backed Ryan will oppose him when the House elects a new speaker in January, although none of them has said so publicly.""I don't think most members feel yet that Ryan is undeserving of more time (as speaker), but frustration with the leadership is certainly growing,"" said Dan Holler of Heritage Action, the political wing of the Heritage Foundation conservative think tank.
