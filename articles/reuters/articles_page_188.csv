By Amy Tennery

Democrats demanding action on gun control turned to Twitter's Periscope and Facebook's live video platform to broadcast their ""sit-in"" on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday after the chamber's cameras shut down.Representative Scott Peters of California told Reuters he downloaded the online video platform Periscope from the House floor after it became clear that chamber cameras were not operating. ""Thanks to them, the American people got to look in on and listen to what is taking place this floor,"" U.S. Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina said in praise of the platform.The protest was the latest move by Democrats to persuade the Republican majority in Congress to take up votes on gun control measures in response to last week's mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, the deadliest in modern U.S. history.""The speaker (Paul Ryan) controls the cameras,"" Peters said. ""We noticed that over lunch, he turned them off - allowed them to be turned off.""A spokesman for Twitter said that tweets from Peters' account containing the Periscope footage had been viewed over 800,000 times as of Wednesday night.Ryan's spokesman, AshLee Strong, said in a statement:     ""The House cannot operate without members following the rules of the institution, so the House has recessed subject to the call of the chair.""
At about noon EDT, presiding House officer and Republican Representative Ted Poe declared the House not in order, as Democratic protesters sat at the front of the chamber.Cable news channel C-SPAN, which typically uses the House cameras to broadcast live footage of Congress, broadcast Peters' Periscope and other lawmakers' feeds.Other news networks and cable news channels, including MSNBC, FOX and CNN, also ran parts of the footage.
C-SPAN communications director Howard Mortman said it was the first time the channel broadcast a live social media feed from the House floor.""The House controls the cameras and that means they control the camera angles, the audio, video, the whole thing,"" Mortman said. ""We're using social media platforms to show what's happening.""""With official broadcasts suspended in the House, we've created a channel to follow #NoBillNoBreak on #Periscope live,"" Periscope said in a tweet.Peters said about five or six Democratic House members had broadcast live video during the sit-in. Late Wednesday, lawmakers cheered their thanks during one of his feeds that aired on C-SPAN.
One representative, Eric Swalwell of California, published live video from the House floor to Facebook.#NoBillNoBreak became a rallying cry for gun control supporters on Twitter and quickly became the top-trending hashtag in the United States on the social media platform.Politicians and average social media users alike used the hashtag as a sign of solidarity with the sit-in.""Nowhere I'd rather spend my bday than the House floor w/ @repjohnlewis for gun control. #NoBillNoBreak #goodtrouble,"" tweeted Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is mentioned as a potential running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

WASHINGTON U.S. House of Representatives Republicans moved to force an end to the Democratic sit-in over gun control legislation by scheduling a vote on another issue later on Wednesday night, Republican lawmakers said. ""We're going to continue to operate,"" said Republican Representative John Fleming. ""They can do as they please.""Fleming and other Republican lawmakers said House leaders wanted to file legislation on Zika funding on Wednesday night, so that it could be voted on later in the week. Lawmakers also said a vote was likely on legislation involving a rule submitted by the Department of Labor.

By Sarah N. Lynch
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. law enforcement officials have charged 301 suspects with trying to defraud Medicare and other federal insurance programs in 2016, marking the ""largest takedown"" involving health care fraud allegations, the Justice Department said on Wednesday.The national sweep resulted in charges against doctors, nurses, pharmacists and physical therapists accused of fraud that cost the government $900 million, the department said.     The cases involved an array of charges, including conspiracy to commit health care fraud, money laundering and violations of an anti-kickback law. This year's sweep exceeded last year's record in which 243 defendants faced charges in a combined $712 million in government losses. Officials said it was the largest takedown in the nine-year history of the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, a joint initiative between federal, state and local law enforcement.
Attorney General Loretta Lynch said some of the cases reflect new, troublesome trends, including instances of identity theft in order to prepare fake prescriptions and a growing number of cases involving compounding, or the mixing of medications tailored to meet a patient's needs.Compounded medications are typically very expensive. From 2012 to 2014, the quarterly Medicare spending on these prescriptions skyrocketed from $28 million to $171 million.
""As this takedown should make clear, health care fraud is not an abstract violation or benign offense,"" Lynch said. ""It is a serious crime."" In one case, two owners of a group of outpatient clinics and a patient recruiter stand accused of filing $36 million in fraudulent claims for physical therapy and other services that were not medically necessary. 
The Justice Department said that to find patients, the clinic operators and the recruiter targeted poor drug addicts and offered them narcotics so they could bill them for services that were never provided.Another case was filed against the operator of a marketing business that received referral fees from pharmacies that filled and billed Tricare, the U.S. military's government insurance program, for compounded medicines. The prescriptions were submitted via ""telemedicine"" sites, and doctors were given blank prescription forms to fill out, regardless of medical necessity, according to the complaint.One doctor told the FBI her identity and medical credentials were used without her permission to fill thousands of dollars worth of prescriptions."

By Lindsay Dunsmuir
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. federal program that pays elderly Americans' hospital bills will exhaust its reserves in 2028, two years sooner than last year's estimate, trustees of the program said on Wednesday, but spending growth remained within forecasts.The Medicare program, which provides health coverage for more than 55 million older as well as disabled people, said that the projected growth rate for per capita spending has not exceeded its target.That put aside the need for the program's regulator, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, to establish a savings target and to initiate mandatory spending cuts, their annual financial report said. As such, the government would not need to immediately set up an Independent Payment Advisory Board to make proposals on the cuts, it said.Drug stocks gained after the release of the report on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index up 2.5 percent. It had lost ground ahead of the report's release. Wall Street analysts had worried that if the mandatory savings clause was triggered, the new board might have tried to implement cuts in prescription drug prices.
""Not hitting the trigger is good news for healthcare investors,"" Sanford Bernstein analyst Timothy Anderson wrote in a research note.In the annual financial review, the trustees also said that the combined Social Security and disability trust fund reserves are estimated to run out in 2034, the same projection as last year.Medicare spending in 2015 totaled $647.6 billion.   
The Medicare program's trust fund for hospital care is still scheduled to have sufficient funding 11 years longer than the estimate given before the Affordable Care Act was passed, the trustees said.The trustees put the shorter timeline down to changes in estimates of income and cost, particularly in the near term.
A depletion in funds available for Medicare and Social Security does not mean the programs would suddenly stop. At the current rate of payroll tax collections, Medicare would be able to cover 87 percent of costs in 2028. This would fall to 79 percent by 2043 and then gradually increase.Social Security would be able to pay about three-quarters of scheduled benefits from 2034 to 2090, the trustees said.

WASHINGTON The White House on Thursday panned new Republican legislation to put $1.1 billion toward fighting the Zika virus, a plan that was much less than the $1.9 billion requested by President Barack Obama.""This plan from Congressional Republicans is four months late and nearly a billion dollars short of what our public health experts have said is necessary to do everything possible to fight the Zika virus and steals funding from other health priorities,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a statement.

By Patricia Zengerle and Kouichi Shirayanagi
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Former Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio will seek re-election to his U.S. Senate seat, he announced on Wednesday, reversing a pledge not to run and saying the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency worries him.The first-term Florida senator said the Senate can be frustrating, but that it is also a place where policy advances can be made and one that can counteract the power of the White House.""But as we begin the next chapter in the history of our nation, there's another role for the Senate that could end up being its most important in the years to come: The Constitutional power to act as a check and balance on the excesses of a president,"" Rubio said in a statement.The 45-year-old lawmaker, a proven fund-raiser who is well known nationally, had been under intense pressure to run, especially given the cost of contesting an important election swing-state where campaign advertising is expensive.Republicans are more likely to retain his seat if he is a candidate in the Nov. 8 general election, as they face a tough fight to preserve their majority in the Senate. He could also rally Republican voters to head to the polls in a state that is critical in the presidential race.President Barack Obama, a Democrat, took Florida by just a one percentage-point margin in 2012 over Republican Mitt Romney.This year, Republicans must defend 24 of the 54 seats they now hold in the 100-member Senate, compared with just 10 the Democrats have to fight to retain. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said it would be a ""terrific outcome"" if Rubio decided to run. 
Rubio had harsh words for Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, predicting her election would mean four more years of what he termed Obama's ""failed"" policies.TRUMP 'WORRISOME'
But he said the prospect of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump winning the White House was also ""worrisome,"" citing Trump's statements about women and minorities and noting that many of the likely Republican nominee's positions on important issues are unknown.
""If he is elected, we will need Senators willing to encourage him in the right direction, and if necessary, stand up to him,"" Rubio's statement said.Still, he pledged to vote for Trump, a real estate mogul and political neophyte who has shaken the Republican establishment. ""It's not the choice I wanted ... and it's not the choice a lot of people are comfortable with, but it's the choice we have,"" he told CNN in an interview.His announcement did not mention the massacre last week at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, but he had said in recent days he was reconsidering his decision not to run because of his concern about serious events in the country, including the mass shooting.
The decision reversed a campaign pledge Rubio made a year ago to retire from the Senate if his presidential bid failed. He ended his bid for the nomination in March after losing the primary in his home state to Trump following a harsh war of words.The Cook Political Report said Rubio's announcement ""breathed new life"" into Republican chances of holding onto the seat but still rated the race as a toss-up, citing his poor Senate attendance record and the senator's remarks during his presidential campaign that he was ""frustrated"" with the upper chamber.Republican U.S. Representative David Jolly, who had been seeking the Senate seat, opened the door for Rubio to run when he stepped aside last week. After Wednesday's announcement, Florida Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez Cantera, a friend of Rubio, and Republican U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis also scrapped plans to seek the seat. Other Republicans, however, have not announced plans to quit ahead of Florida's Aug. 30 primary.U.S. Representative Patrick Murphy, a leading Democratic challenger, accused Rubio of first abandoning his constituents, and now ""treating them like a consolation prize.""

By Alana Wise
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Brent Scowcroft, who was national security adviser to two Republican U.S. presidents, on Wednesday endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for president over Donald Trump, in a snub of the Republican Party's likely nominee by a prominent member of its security wing.""The presidency requires the judgment and the knowledge to make tough calls under pressure,"" the Republican elder statesman said in a statement. ""I believe Hillary Clinton has the wisdom and experience to lead our country at this critical time.""Scowcroft, 91, served as national security adviser under Presidents Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush. Ford was president from 1974 to 1977 and Bush from 1989 to 1993.He joined a number of well-known Republicans defecting due to the prospect of a Trump presidency, including Richard Armitage, deputy secretary of state under President George W. Bush. Armitage gave Clinton, 68, who was secretary of state under Democratic President Barack Obama, his backing last week. Trump ""doesn't appear to be a Republican, he doesn't appear to want to learn about issues. So, I'm going to vote for Mrs. Clinton,"" Armitage told Politico at the time. 
The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Scowcroft's endorsement of Clinton.Trump, 70, who has never held elected office, often boasts on the campaign trail his relative newness to politics, appealing to voters disillusioned by the current political climate. 
Despite that facet of his appeal - which helped Trump beat 16 rivals in the campaign's primary phase to become his party's presumptive nominee - establishment Republicans worry that his inexperience and brash style will alienate foreign allies and other international partners.Among his proposals, Trump has criticized NATO, a cornerstone of U.S. security policy, and said he would consider letting Japan and South Korea develop their own nuclear weapons instead of relying on the United States for protection against North Korea and China.""Secretary Clinton shares my belief that America must remain the world's indispensable leader,"" Scowcroft said. ""She understands that our leadership and engagement beyond our borders makes the world, and therefore the United States, more secure and prosperous.""
Trump has said he would strengthen national security, but has offered few details about his plans, other than his proposals to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexican border and for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Many national security experts have expressed alarm over the proposed ban and have warned that Trump's fiery rhetoric on the campaign trail is fueling extremism.

WASHINGTON Democrat Hillary Clinton said on Wednesday that if the U.S. Congress does not act to close tax loopholes that benefit the wealthy and corporations, she will ask the Treasury Department to take up the issue if she is elected president.""Let's make sure that Wall Street, corporations and the super rich pay their fair share of taxes,"" Clinton said in Raleigh, North Carolina, the state capital.The former U.S. secretary of state used her campaign stop to offer her vision for bolstering the economy after using a speech on the topic on Tuesday to attack presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, predicting a ""Trump recession"" if he becomes president.Trump delivered his own speech attacking Clinton on Wednesday, saying she is part of a political establishment that has cheated American workers through bad trade deals.In her speech on Wednesday, Clinton said, ""I think it's an understatement to say Americans face a choice in November. ""I'm here today to offer an alternative.""When people say the game is rigged, the best evidence is the (U.S.) tax code. It is riddled with scams, loopholes and other special breaks,"" added Clinton, the presumptive Democratic  nominee.
She said that if the Republican-controlled Congress does not enact reforms to end tax breaks for the wealthy, she would use her presidential authority to direct the Treasury Department to do so.Democratic President Barack Obama has faced criticism for using executive action. In one example, he used executive power to shield certain groups from the threat of deportation when immigration legislation stalled in Congress.Clinton said modifying the tax code is one prong in a five-part plan the federal government would follow to jump-start the American economy if she is elected on Nov. 8:
- Large-scale investment in rebuilding infrastructure to create well-paying jobs; - Enabling debt-free college educations;- Giving companies incentives to share profits with employees;
- Creating national family-friendly policies such as paid family leave.In a nod to populists within the Democratic Party who may have supported U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders during the Democratic Primary, Clinton also said she would aim to raise the federal minimum wage, strengthen labor unions and reject international trade deals that do not benefit U.S. workers.""As I said during the primary, I am a progressive who likes to get things done, and we can do this,"" Clinton said.
