WASHINGTON Republican lawmakers should follow their conscience on whether to support Donald Trump in November's presidential election, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan has said in an interview, reflecting the party's unease over its White House candidate. ""The last thing I would do is tell anybody to do something that's contrary to their conscience. Of course I wouldn't do that,"" the Republicans' most senior elected official said in excerpts released on Friday of an NBC interview set to air on Sunday. Some Republican leaders and lawmakers in the House of Representatives are struggling to get behind the New York businessman, who last month became the party's presumptive nominee for the Nov. 8 election.After an initial delay, Ryan has said he will back Trump but he has also acknowledged deep differences with him. He denounced as textbook racism Trump's criticism of a Mexican-American judge and has also criticized Trump's proposal - reiterated after the  massacre of 49 people in a gay bar in Orlando on Sunday - to temporarily bar Muslims from the United States.As Republicans seek to keep control of both chambers of Congress, Trump's comments on such issues have also worried some lawmakers concerned about their own election prospects, particularly in close races. All 247 House Republican seats are up for grabs in the election.
Trump, who has welcomed support from Ryan, this week fired back at Republican leaders, telling them to stop speaking out against him or else risk him potentially running ""by myself.""Ryan said earlier this week at his weekly press conference that he does not plan to withdraw his support of Trump, although they disagree on some key issues. 
""I feel as a responsibility institutionally as the speaker of the House that I should not be leading some chasm in the middle of our party. Because you know what I know that'll do? That'll definitely knock us out of the White House,"" Ryan said in the interview for NBC's ""Meet the Press"" program.Trump's embrace this week of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and potential gun control measures, in contrast to general Republican orthodoxy have also thrown conservative lawmakers. 
Still, Republican leaders have to reconcile their unease with the fact that primary Republican voters opted for Trump. He has never held elected office before but won more than enough delegates to secure the party's nomination at the Republican convention in July.

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Two senior Republican House of Representatives lawmakers said on Friday they were concerned that Boeing Co's reported plans to sell aircraft to Iran could threaten U.S. national security and had requested more information from the company.""American companies should not be complicit in weaponizing the Iranian Regime,"" Representatives Jeb Hensarling and Peter Roskam said in a letter to Boeing released on Friday.Iran said on Tuesday it had reached an agreement with Boeing for the supply of jetliners, reopening the country's skies to new U.S. aircraft for the first time in decades under an international nuclear agreement that eased sanctions.Boeing has not confirmed an aircraft sale agreement.The company on Tuesday declined to provide detailed comment in response to Western and Middle East sources saying Iran had reached an understanding with the company to acquire over 100 passenger jets.
The nuclear pact reached by Democratic President Barack Obama was opposed by every Republican member of the U.S. Congress. Several questioned the Boeing deal as soon as the news reports came out.In their letter to Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg, the lawmakers asked for ""clarification"" of the current state of negotiations.
Their questions included whether Boeing could guarantee that Iran's government could not convert Boeing passenger aircraft to cargo aircraft and whether it would repossess aircraft if Iran violated the nuclear agreement.Hensarling is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and Roskam is chairman of the Oversight subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee.Not every congressional Republican is opposed to a potential U.S. aircraft deal.
Senator Mark Kirk, who represents Illinois, where Boeing is headquartered, said in a hallway interview at the Senate he had mixed feelings about it.""You want the jobs, but you are worried about what the Iranians are going to do with the aircraft,"" Kirk said this week.

U.S. Representative David Jolly ended his bid for a U.S. Senate seat from Florida on Friday, opening the way for Marco Rubio to seek re-election in an effort to help Republicans maintain control of the chamber.""Marco is saying he's getting in,"" Jolly, a fellow Republican who has been running to fill the seat for the past 10 months, said on CNN. Rubio dropped out of the race for the Republican presidential nomination. Later Friday, Jolly, who represents the area around St. Petersburg and Clearwater, said he will run for re-election to his congressional seat.""Today I am asking my friends and neighbors to let me continue doing my job as a member of Congress,"" Jolly said in a news conference in Clearwater.He will likely face former Governor Charlie Crist, a Democrat, in the Nov. 8 election. 
Rubio, who ended his presidential bid in March, said this week he was reconsidering running and may decide as early as this weekend. Representatives for Rubio declined to answer questions about his future plans.At the news conference, Jolly said he fully expects Rubio to run for re-election to the Senate. His spokesman Preston Rudie told Reuters the congressman ""had no actual knowledge of a Rubio decision.""
Rubio's entry into the senate race would complicate Democrats' efforts to win back a majority in the Senate in the November election.Republicans won control of the Senate in the 2014 mid-term election and now hold 54 seats in the 100-seat chamber. Democrats have 44 seats and two independents are aligned with them.     
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans have urged Rubio to run despite a pledge during his presidential campaign not to seek re-election. They cited polls showing he is the only Republican who can win the state.The deadline is June 24 for candidates to file with Florida election officials their intention to run for the Senate. The Republican primary election will be held on Aug. 30. (Reporting by Kouichi Shirayanagi and Richard Cowan; Editing by Susan Heavey and Jeffrey Benkoe)"	['Rubio', 'McConnell', 'Jolly']	[]

By John Whitesides
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Bernie Sanders promised on Thursday to work with presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to defeat Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election, but did not formally pull out of the race for the White House.Sanders did not endorse Clinton during an online speech to his supporters, but made it clear he was shifting his focus to building a grassroots movement to fight for his liberal policy agenda and transform the Democratic Party.""The major political task that we face in the next five months is to make certain that Donald Trump is defeated and defeated badly, and I personally intend to begin my role in that process in a very short period of time,"" the U.S. senator from Vermont said.""I also look forward to working with Secretary Clinton to transform the Democratic Party so that it becomes a party of working people and young people, and not just wealthy campaign contributors,"" he said in a speech broadcast from his hometown of Burlington, Vermont.
Sanders, who has resisted pressure from Democrats to exit the White House race and back Clinton since she clinched the party nomination last week, said he would keep fighting for his goals of reducing income inequality, removing big money from politics and reining in Wall Street.""Defeating Donald Trump cannot be our only goal. We must continue our grassroots efforts to create the America that we know we can become,"" he said. ""And we must take that energy into the Democratic National Convention on July 25 in Philadelphia where we will have more than 1,900 delegates.""
Sanders has kept his campaign alive as leverage to force concessions from Clinton on his policy goals during deliberations on the party's issues platform, and on the reforms he seeks in the Democratic Party's nominating process.But he has laid off some staff, stopped campaigning and dropped plans to court unbound delegates in an unspoken acknowledgment the former secretary of state will be the nominee.
Sanders, who met with Clinton on Tuesday night after the nominating process ended, said he would continue his discussions with her campaign to make certain ""the Democratic Party passes the most progressive platform in its history, and that Democrats actually fight for that agenda.""""Our vision for the future of this country is not some kind of fringe idea. It is not a radical idea. It is mainstream. It is what millions of Americans believe in and want to see happen,"" Sanders said. (Editing by Peter Cooney)"	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

By Susan Cornwell and Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A long-running battle over gun control in the United States reaches a critical stage next week in the U.S. Senate amid signs Americans are more willing to accept limited restrictions after the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.While it is far from likely new measures will pass, the Orlando, Florida, gay nightclub massacre of 49 people and a suggestion by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that something be done have fostered a different atmosphere.While President Barack Obama was in Orlando consoling the survivors of the rampage by a gunman who claimed allegiance to Islamic State militants, the U.S. Senate moved closer to votes on limited gun control measures.About 71 percent of Americans, including eight out of 10 Democrats and nearly six out of 10 Republicans, favor at least moderate regulations and restrictions on guns, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from Monday to Thursday. That was up from 60 percent in late 2013 and late 2014.As always, Democrats were challenging Republicans to vote for new restrictions and reject pressure from the National Rifle Association, the powerful gun lobby that has been known to punish politicians who thwart its will.U.S. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut and fellow Democrats set the U.S. Capitol abuzz by talking on the Senate floor for nearly 15 straight hours to demand that Congress act on gun control.They ended their speeches before dawn, citing a Republican pledge to hold votes soon on measures to expand background checks on gun buyers and to prevent people on U.S. terrorism watch lists from buying guns.VOTES ON MONDAY 
The Senate is expected to vote on Monday on four proposals. One from Democrat Dianne Feinstein would let the government prevent terrorist suspects from buying guns. A second from Republican John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, would require court approval within three days for a government ban on an individual's attempt to buy a gun. Democrats have said Cornyn's plan is unworkable; Republicans say Feinstein's might harm the rights of people wrongly on terror suspect lists.
A third proposal, from Democrat Murphy, would expand background check procedures to the sales of all firearms, including those online and at gun shows. A fourth proposal, from Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, would provide for law enforcement to be notified if a person investigated for terrorism in the last five years tries to buy a gun. Gun control is a potent issue in U.S. politics. Republicans, who control the Senate, have blocked Democratic-backed gun control measures over the years, saying they infringe on the right to bear arms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.Any bill would have to pass both houses of Congress and be signed by the president to become law. At his weekly news conference on Thursday, Paul Ryan, speaker of the House of Representatives, injected a note of caution.""We don't take away a citizen's rights without due process,"" said Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican. ""If you have a quick idea in the heat of the moment that says let's take away a person's rights without due process, we're going to defend the Constitution.""
MASS SHOOTINGS
A string of mass shootings across the United States in schoolhouses, churches, movie theaters and other public places has failed to break the deadlock.The last major gun control measure was a ban in 1994 on semi-automatic assault weapons such as the one used in Orlando on Sunday. The ban expired 10 years later.One of the most dramatic moments in the Senate debate came when Republican Senator John McCain, who is in a tough re-election race in Arizona, told reporters Obama is ""directly responsible"" for Islamic State-inspired attacks on Americans like the one in Orlando.He later said he meant to say he blamed Obama's decision to withdraw most U.S. forces from Iraq, and that this had fueled the rise of Islamic State.
Murphy, asked what would be the message if the Senate fails to act on the gun control measures next week, suggested it could be a campaign issue for the Nov. 8 election.""There are going to be a lot of voters in this country who are going to watch ... the votes that are cast next week,"" he said.TALKING TO NRA
Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president has been endorsed by the NRA. He jumped into the gun debate by saying he would meet with NRA leaders to talk about barring people who are on terrorism watch lists from buying guns.""I'll be looking at it very, very seriously - the terror watch list and the no-fly list, I'm going to be talking to the NRA about that and starting a real dialogue. I think a lot of people agree with me but I want to really hear what they have to say,"" Trump told Fox News on Wednesday night.Democrats were deeply skeptical that Trump's word signaled any sort of shift toward more Republican support for Democratic-backed gun control proposals.""He is going to meet with the NRA. ... What's he going to come out saying? 'Oh the NRA and I agreed we shouldn't have terrorists have guns,' but doing nothing about it,"" U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York told reporters.

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The awkward efforts of Republicans to embrace their party's standard-bearer Donald Trump looked particularly painful in Congress this week as lawmakers ducked into elevators, dashed away from reporters, ignored questions or, worse, tried to answer them. Only days after a furor over his criticism of a Mexican-American judge, the presumptive presidential nominee sent Republicans reeling again by renewing his call for a ban on Muslim immigration after a gunman who pledged allegiance to Islamic militants killed of 49 people at a Florida nightclub.Then former reality TV star Trump waded into two sensitive topics for social conservatives by embracing the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community and suggesting the country may need certain new gun control measures.  For lawmakers accustomed to well-crafted talking points and predictable lines of questioning, the week marked a chaotic flurry of contorted responses or terse, tight-lipped replies.Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming walked away when asked about Trump's embrace of the LGBT community, saying: ""I don't know what the latest is. I haven't read anything. I haven't been watching.""Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a former Trump adversary in the presidential primaries, had to bat away two Trump questions before he could announce that he is considering running for re-election - a decision that could determine whether Republicans retain control of the Senate in the Nov. 8 election.Senator Ted Cruz, another rival in the primaries, refused to respond directly to the speech in which Trump hardened his line on Muslims while Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr called it ""an OK speech"" before stepping into an elevator and refusing to respond to any more questions.  
The Trump challenge is obvious even for seasoned Republicans.         ""I'm spending my days commenting on everything that Donald Trump says,"" lamented John McCain, chairman of Senate Armed Services Committee.Orrin Hatch, the longest-serving Republican in the Senate, ricocheted from rejection of Trump's comments on Muslims to doubts about the legality of his proposed immigration ban to bafflement over the billionaire's response to the Orlando shootings. 
'YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS UP'
Trump controversies have also overshadowed House Speaker Paul Ryan's rollout of a policy agenda, a campaign document that was supposed to help bring Trump's position more into line with mainline party doctrine. Asked on Thursday whether he was bothered by having to contend with Trump's remarks, Ryan called Trump ""a different kind of candidate...(in) a different kind of year."" 
Asked how many more times he would be called on to do so, Ryan said: ""I don't know the answer to that question either.""In an ironic message to his critics among the Republican leadership this week, Trump had this to say: ""Be quiet, just please be quiet. Don't talk. Please be quiet. Just be quiet.""Ryan's response? ""...You can't make this up sometimes,"" he said.  A political neophyte who has never held elected office, Trump has also said he may not need much from his Republican colleagues on Capitol Hill anyway.""We have to have our Republicans either stick together or let me just do it by myself. I'll do very well,"" he said in a CNN interview. ""A lot of people thought I should do that anyway, but I'll just do it very nicely by myself.""

By Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Senator John McCain said on Thursday that President Barack Obama was ""directly responsible"" for attacks on Americans like the one in Florida because of policies that contributed to the rise of the Islamic State. But the Arizona Republican later  said he misspoke.McCain, who is in a tough re-election race, made the comments after reporters chased him down a marble stairway and into a hallway of the U.S. Capitol. They asked what he was hearing from constituents about gun control issues being debated in the Senate after Sunday's shooting rampage by a gunman who claimed allegiance to Islamic State militants.""I'm hearing a lot from my constituents about what happened and of course I am making them realize that Barack Obama is directly responsible for it,"" McCain said.""Because when he pulled everybody out of Iraq, al Qaeda went to Syria, became ISIS, and ISIS is what it is today thanks to Barack Obama's failures, utter failures,"" McCain said. ""So the responsibility for it lies with President Barack Obama and his failed policies.""
After media reports began to appear about his comments, McCain, who lost the White House to Obama in the 2008 presidential election, posted a clarification on Twitter and then issued a statement that said he meant to blame Obama's policies, not the president personally.""I misspoke. I did not mean to imply that the president was personally responsible. I was referring to President Obama's national security decisions, not the president himself,"" McCain said in the statement.Forty-nine people died in the shooting in Orlando, the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The gunman was U.S.-born Omar Mateen, 29, whose parents immigrated from Afghanistan.
McCain, 79, faces multiple opponents in a Republican primary race in August, and some analysts say he is in danger of losing the Senate seat he has held for three decades.Earlier this week, presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump appeared to suggest Obama may have been complicit in the Orlando attacks.
""Look, we're led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he's got something else in mind,"" Trump told Fox News. ""And the something else in mind -- you know, people can't believe it ... There's something going on. It's inconceivable. There's something going on."" (Editing by Doina Chiacu and Tom Brown)"	['McCain', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The Obama administration believes it will be able to process many more Syrian refugees in the last half of fiscal 2016 than in the first six months, allowing it to meet its goal of admitting at least 10,000 by Sept. 30.In a letter to Democratic Senator Richard Durbin seen by Reuters on Thursday, the White House said it has allocated additional staff and added more processing locations in the Middle East to expedite the screening process without compromising U.S. security.""Therefore, we expect to admit more Syrians in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2016 than we did in the first and second quarters to meet our goal of admitting at least 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year,"" the letter said.The administration's move is in sharp contrast to recent anti-refugee rhetoric by many Republicans, especially since the killings in Orlando on Sunday raised fears of attacks.Donald Trump, the presumptive 2016 Republican presidential nominee, has called for the refugee resettlement program to be suspended, saying ""We don't know who they are. They have no documentation, and we don't know what they're planning.""
Backers of the administration's plan dispute such statements, citing the extensive screening process the Syrian refugees undergo.So far, the United States has offered refuge to far fewer of the millions fleeing the war in Syria than many of its closest allies. Germany has taken in hundreds of thousands and Canada admitted nearly 30,000 between November 2015 and May 1, 2016.
The letter said the administration had set up a temporary processing center in Jordan and expanded operations in Turkey. It also has restarted interviews in neighboring Lebanon, and begun limited processing in Erbil, Iraq.Durbin was a lead author of a letter to President Barack Obama in May, which was signed by more than half the Democrats in the Senate and urged the president to move more quickly to admit Syrians.By mid-May, only 1,736 Syrians had been allowed into the country, a pace that would have fallen far short of the 10,000 goal for the full year.
The letter seen on Thursday was the administration's response to the one sent in May.Obama's plan to admit 10,000 Syrians was met with a firestorm of criticism in the United States, mostly from Republicans who say that violent militants could enter the country by posing as refugees. More than 30 governors, most of them Republicans, have tried to keep refugees out of their states.

By Karen Pierog and Dave McKinney
| CHICAGO

CHICAGO Illinois' long-running budget impasse stung the state on Thursday in the U.S. municipal market where buyers of its $550 million bond issue demanded bigger yields over the market benchmark.The pricing was ""surprisingly soft,"" considering a strong rally in muni bonds on Thursday, said Greg Saulnier, a Municipal Market Data analyst. The results demonstrate that the market is increasing its penalty due to the state's worsening fiscal and political problems, leaving Illinois unable to take full advantage of the historically low borrowing rates.Bank of America Merrill Lynch won the tax-exempt general obligation deal in competitive bidding, pricing bonds due in 2026 with a 5 percent coupon to yield 3.32 percent, which is 185 basis points over MMD's triple-A yield scale. The spread was 175 basis points ahead of the bond sale, according to MMD, a unit of Thomson Reuters. It was also wider than the 154 basis-point spread in 10 years for Illinois' $480 million GO bond sale in January.Illinois is poised to be the only U.S. state since at least the 1930s to end a fiscal year without a complete budget.Its Republican governor and Democratic-controlled legislature have so far failed to reach a deal on fiscal 2016 or 2017 spending plans. That leaves unaddressed the growing structural budget deficit and huge $111 billion unfunded pension liability in the fifth-biggest U.S. state.The bond issue itself was seen as a weapon in the political war to pressure Democrats to cave in to Governor Bruce Rauner's demands, while losing money for the cash-strapped state.
ILLINOIS SELLS INTO MARKET RALLY 
Muni yields have been hitting new record lows on MMD's scale in recent days, driven by cash-heavy investors chasing low supply of debt.Rauner's office said the true interest cost for the bonds, which carry maturities from 2017 to 2041, was 3.74 percent, down from 3.99 percent in the January sale, and the lowest ever for similar general obligation bonds issued by the state.
""It's clear from today's bond sale that investors realize Illinois now has a governor that is trying to turn the state around and right its fiscal ship,"" Rauner spokeswoman Catherine Kelly said in a statement.Some market participants thought Illinois' so-called credit spread should be even wider.""It's odd to me,"" said Nicholos Venditti, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. ""Illinois has proven time and time again they can't get anything done.""   Heading into the deal, Illinois' credit ratings, which were already the lowest among the states, were downgraded by Moody's Investor Service and Standard & Poor's. 
The governor's office also revealed on Wednesday that the state lacks appropriations to actually spend all the proceeds earmarked mainly for road construction and mass transit projects due to the impasse.State Treasurer Michael Frerichs, a first-term Democrat, predicted the bond issue could be a net money-loser for Illinois if the borrowed funds go unspent and must be invested short-term.""We'll make far less in interest than we'll be paying in interest to the bondholders,"" Frerichs said in an interview. ""I think we need to make these investments in infrastructure, but we're going about it in the wrong order. It seems backwards issuing the bonds and hoping they get an appropriation to spend them.""On Wednesday, Rauner administration officials warned of the imminent shutdown of transportation projects and the loss of 25,000 construction jobs without a budget deal.Spokesmen for House Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton, both Democrats, declined to speculate on the chances of either legislative chamber granting the Rauner administration the spending authority it needs to fully tap the bond issue.

9	9	http://reuters.com/article/us-beverages-philadelphia-sodatax-idUSKCN0Z22G3	Philadelphia passes soda tax after mayor rewrites playbook	"


By Luc Cohen
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney scored a victory that had eluded more than 40 U.S. public officials who took on the powerful U.S. soda industry when the city council voted on Thursday to slap a tax on sweetened drinks. After a bitter, months-long battle, the city council voted 13-4 to approve a 1.5 cent-per-ounce tax on sugary and diet drinks beginning in January. The council already approved the plan in a preliminary vote last week, and the outcome had not been expected to change. The City of Brotherly Love became the biggest U.S. city to have such a tax. Much smaller Berkeley, California, was the first.Similar efforts, including several spearheaded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, were defeated after intense lobbying from organizations like the American Beverage Association, which opposes the Philadelphia move and represents Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo Inc. Following Thursday's vote, the ABA said it would take legal action to stop the tax. The Philadelphia vote marked a major victory for health advocates who say sugary drinks cause obesity and diabetes. But experts noted those concerns were not the focus for Kenney and other backers of the tax as they took on critics complaining that ""nanny state"" public health measures intrude on residents' personal lives.Instead, Kenney rewrote the soda-tax advocate's playbook. He played up the benefits of the cash injection from the tax for the city's depleted coffers. In the first year, the tax is projected to raise $91 million, and he pledged to spend funds on public programs such as universal pre-kindergarten.""If you want to tax something and people know where the money's going to go, then it's easier for them to get behind it,"" Kenney said in an interview. He noted that focusing on revenue, rather than health, was largely responsible for the measure's passage. The strategic shift could lend momentum to movements in San Francisco, neighboring Oakland, California, and Boulder, Colorado. Residents of those cities will vote in November on similar taxes, which could deal further blows to a U.S. soft drink industry already hit by declining soda consumption.U.S. soda consumption fell for the 11th straight year in 2015, according to Euromonitor data. 
AVOIDING THE BLOOMBERG TRAP
Bloomberg made public health a centerpiece of his tenure as New York City mayor between 2002 and 2013. He moved to limit smoking in parks and restaurants, ban transfats and require calorie counts posted in some restaurants.On soda, he pushed for a tax, then a ban on soda purchases with food stamps, and finally a much-lampooned limit on the size of sugary drinks. His efforts were ultimately rejected, with critics decrying the moves toward a ""nanny state."" The strategy worked in Britain, where a new soft drinks levy was announced in March after officials emphasized the country's obesity crisis, saying it cost the economy billions of pounds annually and was a huge burden on the state-funded health system. 
That approach never worked in Philadelphia. Michael Nutter, the previous mayor, twice tried to pass a soda tax as a health initiative and as a way to plug a budget shortfall. He was unable to push it through the city council.""Twice before it was used in Philadelphia and it was not successful. It was used in New York and it was not effective,"" said Kenney, adding that while the health benefits of a tax are not ""less important,"" they are less tangible. Kenney, who became mayor in January, had made a campaign pledge to provide universal pre-kindergarten, and he kept that issue as his focus. A spokeswoman said complex state laws on taxation made enacting a citywide soda tax the best option to raise revenue for that signature proposal.Bloomberg personally contributed funding to support Philadelphia's pro-tax campaigners. 
FIZZING WESTWARD
Opponents of Philadelphia's soda tax argued that the measure will disproportionately hurt the poor and prompt Philadelphians to travel to nearby suburbs to buy soda. A spokesman for No Philly Grocery Tax, a local ABA-funded group, said it would sue the city to stop it from imposing the ""unconstitutional"" tax, but was still analyzing all its legal options. In a statement, it called the tax ""regressive and discriminatory."" Kenney said the city was prepared to defend the tax in any litigation from the beverage industry. ""It's the precedent that they were so staunchly fighting, and that's their problem now,"" Kenney said. ""You're going to see the beginnings of a kind of domino effect relative to this specific effort."" In Colorado, Boulder hopes to use soda tax revenue on health programs, and San Francisco and Oakland officials would recommend but not require funds raised to go toward obesity and diabetes prevention. When Berkeley passed its soda tax in 2014, industry groups dismissed the measure as a fluke given the city's largely white population and reputation as a hotbed for liberal measures.But Philadelphia is the fifth-largest U.S. city, with 1.6 million people. ""No one can trivialize it as they can trivialize Berkeley,"" said Larry Tramutola, a California political strategist who worked on the Berkeley campaign and is currently leading the San Francisco and Oakland efforts.
