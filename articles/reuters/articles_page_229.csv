HANOI U.S. President Barack Obama said several civil society members in Vietnam were prevented from meeting him on Tuesday and that, despite great strides made by the country, Washington still had concerns about the limits it puts on political freedom.Obama said during a meeting with about six activists that there were ""significant areas of concern"" about political freedom and praised those Vietnamese who were ""willing to make their voices heard"".
Obama announced on Monday the end of an arms ban on Vietnam, which Washington had long said hinged on the extent to which the country's human rights record had improved.

SAN FRANCISCO Facebook Inc (FB.O) said on Monday that it had changed some of the procedures for its ""Trending Topics"" section after a news report alleging it suppressed conservative news prompted a U.S. Congressional demand for more transparency.The company said an internal probe showed no evidence of political bias in the selection of news stories for Trending Topics, a feature that is separate from the main ""news feed"" where most Facebook users get their news.But the world's largest social network said in a blogpost that it was introducing several changes, including elimination of a top-ten list of approved websites, more training and clearer guidelines to help human editors avoid ideological or political bias, and more robust review procedures.Earlier this month, a former Facebook contractor had accused the company's editors of deliberately suppressing conservative news. The allegations were reported by technology news website Gizmodo, which did not identify the ex-contractor. The report led Republican Sen. John Thune to write a letter demanding that the company explain how it selects news articles for its Trending Topics list. (bit.ly/1Tvv3Nm)
Two days after Thune's letter, Facebook published a lengthy blogpost detailing how Trending Topics works even though it rarely discloses such practices. Previously, it had never discussed the inner workings of the feature, which displays topics and news articles in the top right hand corner of the desktop homepage for its more than 1.6 billion users.Facebook said its investigation showed that conservative and liberal topics were approved as trending topics at nearly identical rates. It said it was unable to substantiate any allegations of politically motivated suppression of particular subjects or sources.
But it did not rule out human error in selecting topics.""Our investigation could not fully exclude the possibility of isolated improper actions or unintentional bias in the implementation of our guidelines or policies,"" Colin Stretch, Facebook's General Counsel, wrote in a company blogpost. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg met last week with more than a dozen conservative politicians and media personalities to discuss issues of trust in the social network.
In his letter, Thune had called on Facebook to respond to the criticism and sought answers by May 24 to several questions about its internal practices.""Any attempt by a neutral and inclusive social media platform to censor or manipulate political discussion is an abuse of trust and inconsistent with the values of an open internet,"" Thune said.

HANOI The United States and Vietnam on Tuesday signed an agreement allowing the U.S. Peace Corps to work in the country for the first time.The signing, which comes amid a historic three-day visit by President Barack Obama, follows more than a decade of negotiations between the two countries to establish a Peace Corps operation in Vietnam.The program, which is expected to begin over the next two years, allows Peace Corps volunteers to teach English in schools in the country's two largest cities, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, said Peace Corps Director Carrie Hessler-Radelet, who signed the agreement with Vietnam's ambassador to the United States, Pham Quang Vinh.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who was present for the signing, said the agreement marked a further normalizing of relations between the United States and Vietnam.
""For 20 years now we have had what we call a normal relationship,"" said Kerry, who in 1968 served as a young U.S. naval officer in the Vietnam War. 
""This is normal, having the Peace Corps being able to move forward, having young Americans come here, not always young, to be able to teach English in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh is the next step forward to building the relationship between the United States and Vietnam,"" he added.After the signing, Hessler-Radelet turned to Kerry saying: ""You've waited for this for a long time.""

WASHINGTON The U.S. House of Representatives voted down on Monday a measure that would have compelled cell phone carriers to disclose a phone's location with law enforcement in the event of an emergency, amid a last-minute lobbying effort from privacy advocates opposed to it.Lawmakers voted 229-158 to pass the Kelsey Smith Act, falling short of the two-thirds threshold necessary due to rules invoked to expedite the bill's vote.The rejection was considered surprising, as House leadership rarely schedules a vote on legislation it is not confident will pass.However, Civil liberties groups aggressively opposed the bill on Monday, arguing that while well intended, it would create a warrant loophole and could lead to expanded government surveillance. 
R Street, a libertarian-leaning think tank, said phone companies already possess the authority to share cell phone location data in emergency situations and did so frequently, making the legislation largely unnecessary.The bill is named after a deceased 18-year-old Kansas woman who disappeared following a visit to a local Target store in 2007. Smith was found murdered four days later only after Verizon, her cell phone provider, shared the location of her phone with authorities, according to Representative Kevin Yoder, a Kansas Republican and author of the bill.
""While I'm disappointed in tonight's outcome, I look forward to the bill being brought back to the House floor when a simple majority vote can get it passed."" Yoder said in a statement.Smith's parents were in attendance in the House chamber during the vote, according to Yoder's office.
More than 20 states have already adopted versions of the law since Smith's death. (Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by Leslie Adler)"

""I am disappointed but not surprised by Secretary Clinton's unwillingness to debate before the largest and most important primary in the presidential nominating process,"" Sanders said in a statement.The U.S. senator from Vermont has remained steadfast in his long-shot battle with Clinton for the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election, although he lags her in the delegate count with only a few state contests remaining.""Naturally, Fox News is disappointed that Secretary Clinton has declined our debate invitation,"" Bill Sammon, Fox News vice president and Washington managing editor, said in a statement, ""especially given that the race is still contested and she had previously agreed to a final debate before the California primary.""

By Kim Palmer
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND A federal judge in Cincinnati temporarily blocked the implementation of a state law that would have effectively de-funded 28 Ohio Planned Parenthood clinics, in a ruling on Monday.U.S. District Judge Michael Barrett granted a two-week stay halting the diversion of federal funding in a ruling on a May 11 lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and Southwest Ohio.The Ohio law signed in February by Republican Governor John Kasich stripped $1.3 million in federal taxpayer funds from any healthcare organization that provides abortion services. The law was scheduled to go into effect on Monday.The new rules affected funding for Planned Parenthood programs for mothers' and infants' health, HIV counseling and testing, and sex education. Planned Parenthood offers abortions in some of its Ohio clinics, but not all of them.In a 20-page opinion, Barrett said the law was enacted to make it difficult for women to obtain an abortion, and said that Planned Parenthood had shown it could successfully win its legal action.
He wrote that Planned Parenthood would be ""forced to end health care and education programs and terminate employees, depriving thousands of Ohioans of high-quality, affordable health care services and education programs.""Ohio already has a law barring the use of state funding for abortions.The lawsuit was one of a number of legal actions filed by Planned Parenthood over access to healthcare at its centers since mid-2015, when anti-abortion activists began releasing videos purporting to show group officials negotiating prices for aborted fetal tissue.
Ohio Right to Life president Mike Gonidakis chastised Barrett as an ""activist judge"" for the ruling.""Despite the will of the people, Planned Parenthood will continue to feed at the trough of taxpayer dollars for another two weeks. Today, Planned Parenthood's greed and power are on full display in Ohio,"" Gonidakis said in a statement.
Jerry Lawson, chief executive of Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio, applauded the ruling.""This ruling is a victory for the tens of thousands of Ohioans that rely on Planned Parenthood for care each year,"" he said in a statement.Planned Parenthood attorneys had argued that the new law would be an unconstitutional burden on abortion rights and that it violated the equal protection clause by treating the organization differently from other healthcare providers.

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The head of a hard-line Republican conservative faction in the U.S. Congress wants to impeach the nation's top tax officer and said lawmakers could do this without accusing him of any crime.Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen should be impeached within weeks, said Jim Jordan, chairman of the House of Representatives Freedom Caucus, in an interview.Jordan's demand comes amid numerous Republican attacks on the IRS in recent months. Bashing the tax-collecting agency is a perennial Capitol Hill practice, but Jordan and a handful of other conservatives have been pushing it further than usual.He said Jordan could be impeached simply because he had betrayed the trust put in him by the U.S. public to carry out his job correctly.""When someone violates the public trust in such a way as this individual has, and that agency has, then that's what warrants ... impeachment,"" Jordan said.Impeachment is a formal charge of wrongdoing for a trial that would occur in the Senate, where a two-thirds vote is necessary for removal from office. Republicans control only 54 of the 100 Senate seats, making such a vote unlikely.
Asked when the House should act, the Ohio Republican replied: ""I hope before we leave for the summer break.""   The IRS said in a statement that Koskinen has provided Congress with full cooperation and truthful testimony and remains focused on serving U.S. taxpayers.On Tuesday, Republicans will detail their complaints about Koskinen at a House Judiciary Committee hearing.
Never popular with lawmakers, the IRS angered Republicans in 2013-2014 in a controversy over its handling of applications from conservative political groups for tax-exempt status.The episode caused a shake-up of top IRS personnel. Koskinen was brought in by the Obama administration in late 2013 to restore order. But the House has since approved several bills attacking the IRS and its budget has been sharply cut.     Jordan said a second hearing in June would be about determining the standard for impeachment.
The grounds for impeachment listed in the Constitution are ""treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.""Koskinen has declined an invitation to testify on Tuesday. He is accused of failing to comply with a congressional subpoena and misleading investigators. Republicans have said his inaction resulted in the destruction of thousands of key emails.Up to now, impeachment has been used against two presidents, a cabinet secretary, a senator and 15 federal judges, according to the Congressional Research Service.

WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate on Tuesday will take up, and likely pass, a resolution to repeal a new Labor Department rule aimed at protecting retirement savers from profit-hungry brokers, a move that President Barack Obama has threatened to veto.A notice sent to senators on Monday showed that a debate and vote on the resolution were scheduled for Tuesday morning, less than a week before the chamber recesses for the Memorial Day holiday. The vote requires a simple majority, which Republicans command in both houses of Congress. The House of Representatives passed its version of the resolution last month, in a vote along party lines. But the resolution will have a short life span. Obama has threatened to veto legislation undoing a key financial initiative of his second term. His administration in April released the rule to set a fiduciary standard for financial brokers who sell retirement products, requiring them to put clients' best interests ahead of their bottom lines. Republican leaders and some in the financial industry said complying with the rule would be expensive for brokers and result in higher costs for retirement advice that many Americans could not afford. They also said the rule did not take into account other laws and regulations on financial advice.
The Senate fight started early, with Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, saying on Monday that Republicans wanted to ""make it easier - easier - for giant Wall Street financial institutions to cheat Americans out of their retirement savings.""
Speaking on the Senate floor, the advocate for stricter financial regulation also said the vote was motivated by election-year politics and that the resolution ""will sure help fill up the campaign accounts of the Republican senators who vote for it.""

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The Supreme Court on Monday let stand a lower court ruling that Virginia's Republican-led legislature unlawfully considered race when drawing U.S. congressional districts by packing black voters into one in a move opponents said diluted black electoral clout.The case focused on the composition of a majority-black U.S. House of Representatives district, stretching from Richmond to Norfolk, held by the only black member of Virginia's congressional delegation, Democrat Bobby Scott.The justices ruled 8-0 against a group of current and former Republican U.S. House members who challenged a June 2015 lower court ruling that invalidated the district's boundaries after several voters who lived there filed suit in 2013.Virginia's Democratic attorney general decided not to appeal the 2015 ruling, but the Republican lawmakers took up the case. The Supreme Court on Monday found that those lawmakers lacked legal standing to bring the case in part because they could not show they were harmed by the lower court decision.
The voters who sued in 2013 said Scott's district was racially ""gerrymandered"" by state legislators in 2012 to cram black voters into it and reduce black influence in neighboring districts in violation of the U.S. Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law.Michele Jawando, a lawyer with the liberal advocacy group Center for American Progress, called the ruling ""good news not only for Virginia voters and voting advocates, but also for other states currently dealing with constitutional issues around their congressional district maps.""
""A just and fair democracy necessitates that all voters can access the ballot without worrying about political games and racial discrimination,"" Jawando added.Democrats have accused Republican legislators around the country of drawing electoral maps to minimize the influence of black and Hispanic voters, who tend to cast ballots for Democratic candidates. Republicans have accused Democrats in Democratic-led states of using the so-called redistricting process to minimize the clout of Republican-leaning voters.
Following the 2015 ruling, the boundaries of an adjoining district, currently represented by white Republican Randy Forbes, were redrawn to add some black voters from Scott's district. This could make the district a possible Democratic pickup in the Nov. 8 election.Forbes is one of the Republicans who appealed to the Supreme Court. Two of the others, Robert Wittman and David Brat, said they had legal standing to bring the case because their chances of re-election would be reduced by having more Democratic voters in their districts.

GENEVA U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's proposal to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is a ""kind of propaganda or advertisement"" in his election race, a senior North Korean official said on Monday.Trump, in a wide-ranging interview with Reuters in New York last week, said he is willing to talk to the North Korean leader to try to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program, proposing a major shift in U.S. policy toward the isolated nation.""It is up to the decision of my Supreme Leader whether he decides to meet or not, but I think his (Trump's) idea or talk is nonsense,"" So Se Pyong, North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told Reuters on return from Pyongyang after attending the first ruling party congress in 36 years.""It's for utilization of the presidential election, that's all. A kind of a propaganda or advertisement,"" he said. ""This is useless, just a gesture for the presidential election.""""There is no meaning, no sincerity,"" So added.
As a candidate, U.S. President Barack Obama made unfulfilled campaign promises to meet the leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), he said.North Korea conducted a fourth nuclear test in January and launched a long-range rocket in February, triggering tougher international sanctions and the adoption of a more hardline position by South Korean President Park Geun-hye.
So, who is also North Korea's ambassador to the U.N.-backed Conference on Disarmament, reiterated that his country was prepared to return to stalled six-party talks on its nuclear program. China and Russia backed the idea, but the United States and its allies South Korea and Japan reject it, he said.""As a responsible nuclear state ... we will never use them first,"" So said. ""If the United States use their nuclear weapons first, then we have to use also that one."" ""If the United States gives up their hostile policies and changes their attitude, then we also (can) have relations as a normal country,"" So said. ""To South Korea, we proposed high-level military talks but South Korea refused now.""
South Korea dismissed on Monday a North Korean proposal for military talks as ""a bogus peace offensive"" and said it was formally rejecting the overture because it lacked a plan to end the North's nuclear program.So said that North Korea would not share nuclear technology with other countries. ""As a responsible nuclear state, we keep and observe the obligations of non-proliferation of nuclear technology"". (Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Tom Heneghan)"
