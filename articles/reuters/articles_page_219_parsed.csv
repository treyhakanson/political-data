By Jonathan Allen

 (This May 31 story corrects atrium's opening times in sixth paragraph: ""between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m."" instead of ""between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m."")By Jonathan AllenNEW YORK New York City is investigating Donald Trump's practice of closing down the public atrium in Trump Tower for presidential campaign events that are off limits to the public.  In order to add more floors than zoning rules would otherwise allow, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, agreed to create a two-story public atrium on the ground and lower floors of the building, which opened in 1983 on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue.But security staff wearing Trump badges spent several hours shooing away a growing crowd of New Yorkers and tourists from the doors on Tuesday morning after Trump decided to hold a news conference in the atrium to discuss his fundraising for veterans groups.""Department of Buildings inspectors will be investigating the allegations that the (public atrium) was closed contrary to the building owner's agreement with the city,"" Joe Soldevere, a department spokesman, told Reuters on Tuesday.There are scores of ""privately owned public spaces,"" or POPS, throughout New York City, intended as a trade-off between developers who want to build taller and preserving space for the public in the city's densest neighborhoods.
In the case of Trump Tower, the 6,000-square-foot public atrium, which is lined with pink marble, must be open to the public between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. every day, a fact advertised in large gold letters over the building's Fifth Avenue entrance.As with other such spaces, it can be closed up to four times a year for a private event after permission from city officials. Trump has held several events in the public areas of Trump Tower since launching his campaign in the atrium there last June.
Officials at the Department of City Planning, which grants permission to close a POPS for an event, and the Department of Buildings, which investigates violations, said they had no record of Trump ever seeking or being granted permission to shut out the public for a campaign event.The investigation was prompted by media reports of the news conference. Inspectors will seek evidence that the public was denied access without the city's permission, including testimony from anyone turned away. Violations carry a $4,000 fine.
Michael Cohen, an executive vice president for the Trump Organization, said his staff was trying to locate the text of the agreement with the city, and could not immediately confirm or deny the suggestion that closing the atrium was a violation.Trump lives in a penthouse in the tower with his family and has his main office there.He previously battled with the city over the space, most recently after he replaced a bench there with a kiosk selling Trump merchandise. A city judge ruled the kiosk violated Trump's agreement with the city, and Trump agreed to removed the kiosk in January and pay a $4,000 fine.

By Michael Holden
| LONDON

LONDON U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would visit Britain for the opening of his Scottish golf resort on June 24, his first trip to the UK since a spat with Prime Minister David Cameron over comments he made about Muslims.Relations between Cameron and Trump, whose visit comes the day after Britain holds a referendum on its membership of the European Union, have been tense since the British leader called his proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States dangerous and stupid.Trump's idea for a boycott of Muslims, mooted last December, also led to calls from some lawmakers for him to be banned from Britain, with almost 600,000 people signing an online petition to keep him out.While Cameron and his ministers rejected that call, the prime minister did suggest that Trump would unite the nation against him if he visited Britain. 
Trump responded by saying he was unlikely to have a good relationship with Cameron, although both men have since tempered their language after Trump effectively became the presumptive Republican Party nominee.Cameron has said he would be happy to meet him, although no date had been fixed, and Trump said they could have a good relationship after all.A spokesman for Cameron said there were no firm plans for a meeting, although it was a long-standing practice for a prime minister to meet presidential nominees if they visited Britain.
Trump's visit will coincide with the result of Britain's EU referendum, and while Cameron is leading the campaign for Britain to stay in the bloc, Trump has said he thinks Britons would be better off outside.In a statement, Trump made no mention of any potential Cameron meeting, saying only that his visit to Britain was for the official opening of his golf resort at Turnberry following a 200 million pound ($290 million) refurbishment.
A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization said the date of the opening had been planned long in advance and that it was just a coincidence it came the day after the EU vote. The date would not be changed, she added.The golf course has itself pitted Trump against British politicians after Scotland's devolved government approved plans for an offshore wind farm nearby which led Trump to denounce Scottish ministers as ""foolish, small minded and parochial"".

By Girish Gupta and Corina Pons
| CARACAS

CARACAS Venezuela's embattled president, Nicolas Maduro, said on Tuesday night he supported Bernie Sanders in the U.S. presidential race, adding that the candidate, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, would win if the vote were ""free."" Maduro, a socialist who sees himself as the political heir to his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, has long railed against the United States, blaming it for Venezuela's economic crisis and accusing Washington of attempting to topple him.""Bernie Sanders, our revolutionary friend, ought to win in the United States,"" Maduro said during an hours-long televised broadcast. ""If the elections were free ... Bernie Sanders would be president of the United States,"" he said, criticizing the U.S. Electoral College system as unrepresentative of popular sentiment. 
Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, trails former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the race for the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election.In an email to supporters in September, Sanders called Chavez a ""dead communist dictator.""
Venezuela is reeling from a brutal economic crisis that has seen food and medicine running short and spiraling inflation destroying incomes. The United States and Venezuela have had troubled relations since Chavez became president in 1999, and the countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 2010.
Maduro suffered a blow on Tuesday, when the head of the Washington-based Organization of American States called an urgent meeting to discuss whether Venezuela was violating basic democratic principles, paving the way for a vote that could suspend it from the regional diplomatic body. (reut.rs/1P1h0ND)Maduro is also under pressure from Venezuela's opposition, which is pushing for a recall referendum to remove him from office this year, although authorities have said there would be no such vote.

3	3	http://reuters.com/article/us-illinois-budget-idUSKCN0YM2BC	Illinois ends spring session without a FY 2017 budget	"


By Dave McKinney
| SPRINGFIELD, Ill.

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. The Democrat-controlled Illinois Legislature ended its spring session late Tuesday, failing to produce a full fiscal 2017 budget to tackle financial woes or even a plan to fund schools.Hours before the session ended Republican Governor Bruce Rauner chastised Democrats for their ""stunning failure"" on the budget front.""We're like a banana republic. We can't manage our money,"" he said at a news conference.A House-passed budget that Rauner vowed to veto for being more than $7 billion short on revenue failed badly in a Senate vote.Illinois has limped through fiscal 2016 as the only U.S. state without a complete budget, operating under court-ordered spending, and continuing and stopgap appropriations. The governor last year vetoed all but a school funding bill in the Democrats' budget for the fiscal year that ends June 30. The impasse between Rauner and Democrats showed no sign of easing and could leave the nation's fifth-largest state runningon a similar autopilot as the new fiscal year begins July 1.
Vendors, social services providers, state universities, community colleges and others that have received partial or no funding over the last year are reaching breaking point. That in turn could bring widespread operational problems if the state is unable to obtain food, utilities, fuel and other essentials.""Real people are going to suffer. Real people are going to die,"" warned Democratic State Representative Jack Franks.The legislature also failed to approve a stand-alone K-12 education budget. A $15.7-billion bill to ensure schools open in the fall passed the Senate but was soundly defeated in the House. Its demise leaves the financially struggling Chicago Public Schools (CPS) without an additional $475 million in funding in part to help pay for rising contributions to teacher pensions. CPS officials have warned of ""draconian"" spending cuts to deal with a $1 billion budget deficit.
Democratic leaders on Tuesday refused to immediately take up Rauner's short-term budget plan, shunting it off to a bipartisan working group. Future budget deliberations will be complicated by the fact that a tougher, three-fifths voting majority to pass a bill kicks in on Wednesday. House Speaker Michael Madigan has made clear his chamber will meet every week during June to work on a budget. The inability to send Rauner a spending plan exposed an unusual level of dysfunction within the Democratic Party, whose super majorities in both legislative chambers were racked by infighting over how best to confront the 11-month impasse with the governor.
The Senate's refusal to adopt a budget plan bearing the clear imprint of Madigan, the state party chairman, represented a stinging rebuke to the longest-serving statehouse speaker in America and a setback Rauner allies called a ""catastrophe"" for Democrats.Within the 39-member Senate Democratic majority, some senators complained they were unable to have input in the House-passed plan, which arrived last week as a take-it-or-leave it proposition, one of Madigan's legislative hallmarks over the years in his dealings with Illinois' upper legislative chamber.""There was a lot of resentment over the way it was passed,"" said Senate President John Cullerton.Without a budget, Illinois, which already has the lowest bond ratings among the 50 states, risks harming its credit standing further. Credit rating agencies have warned of downgrades if the state fails to tackle its $111-billion unfunded pension liability and huge structural budget deficit.The governor's budget office has hired consultants to help disengage from interest rate swap pacts that could cost the state more than $100 million if its ratings fall below specified levels.

By Emily Flitter and Jonathan Allen
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Tuesday detailed $5.6 million in contributions he raised for military veterans, and staged a fiery news conference where he attacked reporters for questioning him for months about the money.                 Appearing at Trump Tower in Manhattan, the billionaire accused the media of failing to give him credit for raising the funds at an event in January in Iowa.His tirade, in which he called one reporter ""a sleaze"" and sarcastically described another as a ""real beauty,"" overshadowed what otherwise should have been an upbeat event for the presumptive Republican nominee.""The press should be ashamed of themselves,"" he told reporters gathered before him. ""You make me look very bad. I've never received such bad publicity for doing a good job.""While Trump has long had an adversarial relationship with the media, questions about the donations to veterans touched a raw nerve with him as he tries to build a conservative base ahead of the Nov. 8 general election.    Reporters have been persistently asking whether Trump in fact raised all the money he said he had in January and why it took so long to hand donations over to veterans groups.A number of veterans groups listed by Trump on Tuesday as recipients confirmed they had received the donation as listed, ranging from $25,000 to, in one case, $1.1 million, which went to the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation.Some of the donations arrived in February or March, some as recently as last week around the time a critical article appeared in The Washington Post. The money arrived in the form of a check from the Donald J. Trump Foundation.""We received a $75,000 gift early last week from the Trump Foundation, it was not restricted or earmarked in any way,"" said Katherine Fritz, director of development at America's Vetdogs.Trump's criticism of the media dashed the hopes of some Republican leaders who want him to tone down his rhetoric and become more magnanimous now that he has sealed the Republican presidential nomination.The Washington Post said Trump only handed over a personal donation of $1 million last week - four months after announcing it - once the newspaper started asking about the money.
Trump said the news coverage of his veterans group donations had been close to libelous. Asked whether he would maintain an adversarial stance with reporters if elected president, Trump said: ""Yeah, it's going to be like this.""A reporter told Trump he seemed resistant to the kind of scrutiny that comes with the office of U.S. president.But Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary for President George W. Bush, said the news media should stop fretting about how Trump treats them.""My advice to the press: Stop interviewing yourselves about Trump's attack on the press. Don't worry about it. Just do your jobs and be fair,"" he said.The contretemps took place on the same day documents were disclosed from a lawsuit involving Trump University, a now-defunct education program that ran a real estate training program.
Trump has attacked the presiding judge as hostile to him. The university documents showed Trump University created a special class to teach students how to cash in on U.S. mortgage foreclosures when the United States was struggling with an entrenched housing crisis in 2009.       
CLINTON POLL LEAD
Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton sought to take advantage of Trump's discomfort over the media scrutiny he has faced. She told CNN that Trump's tendency to attack his critics ""is a recipe for gridlock in Washington.""Clinton defended her own policy toward dealing with the news media, saying she has conducted 300 interviews this year alone. Unlike Trump, she rarely holds news conferences. Her last one was last December.
Clinton leads Trump by 11 percentage points in the latest Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll. According to the May 27-31 survey of likely voters, 46 percent support the former U.S. secretary of state while 35 percent back Trump.  California Governor Jerry Brown on Tuesday endorsed Clinton for the Democratic nomination, saying it was the only way to ""stop the dangerous candidacy of Donald Trump.""           At his news conference, Trump also bristled at the possibility that Republicans opposed to him might run a third-party candidate as an alternative to Trump or the expected Democratic nominee Clinton.He said a leader of that effort, Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard magazine, ""looks like such a fool.""""Let me tell you these people are losers,"" said Trump, adding that a third-party candidacy would guarantee Clinton wins the White House and deny Republicans the chance to put conservatives on the Supreme Court.""What you're going to do is lose the election for the Republicans and therefore you lose the Supreme Court,"" he said.Trump read out a list of veterans' organizations that had received money from the January event, which he attended instead of participating in a Fox News-sponsored candidates' debate. He said the money was benefiting 41 groups and that the total cash raised could climb as more comes in. He turned the microphone over briefly to Al Baldasaro, a Trump supporter and a veteran from New Hampshire who also skewered the news media, saying reporters should ""get your head out of your butt, focus on the real issues.""

By Amanda Becker
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's eponymous business seminar program created a class to teach students how to cash in on U.S. mortgage foreclosures during the housing crisis.Trump University promised in 2009 that its ""Fast Track to Foreclosure Investing"" would teach students how to take advantage of the crisis, according to university documents unsealed last week in a lawsuit against the now-defunct program.    The release will likely stoke criticism from the campaign of Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, who last week accused her likely rival in the Nov. 8 presidential election of having cheered on the 2008 housing crash as an investment opportunity.A spokeswoman for Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment, although Trump reacted to Clinton's criticism last week, saying: ""What am I going to do? I'm in business.""
A Trump University advertisement released in the case said one of its free investor workshops would explain how to ""Cash in on one of the greatest property liquidations in history!""Trump University instructors were to teach students how to ""capitalize without harm"" and find ways for ""sellers to move on without shame,"" according to a December 2008 summary of the seminar.
An earlier 2007 memo to enrollment counselors stated that about 1.5 million U.S. homeowners would face foreclosure that year and laid out how they should advise students to seize the ""tremendous opportunity"" to purchase properties at ""major discounts"" in ""hot markets"" such as Arizona, Florida and Texas.The roughly 400 pages of documents included ""playbooks"" on how to recruit students, directions for how instructors should deal with the media and other details about Trump's seminar program. They were unsealed on Friday by U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, whom Trump called ""hostile"" and ""a hater,"" adding he believed the judge was Mexican.
New York's attorney general slammed Trump on Tuesday for his comment on the judge's ethnicity. Curiel is an American who was born in East Chicago, Indiana, and graduated from the Indiana University School of Law.Clinton's attack on Trump last week was prompted by recently released audio that Trump recorded in 2006 for Trump University. In remarks on a possible ""bubble burst,"" Trump said in the recording: ""I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy"" to ""make a lot of money.""

WASHINGTON New York's attorney general, who has filed a lawsuit against Donald Trump's education venture, Trump University, slammed the presumptive Republican presidential nominee on Tuesday for his attack on a U.S. district judge's ethnicity.Trump, a New York billionaire businessman, is fighting a trio of lawsuits that accuse his education program of misleading thousands of people who paid up to $35,000 for seminars to learn about his real-estate investment strategies.""This was a fraud from top to bottom. He's using every trick he can to delay the release of documents, to delay the trials, attacking the judge for his ethnicity, attacking me and accusing me of conspiring with the president of the United States,"" New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, told CNN.Days after Judge Gonzalo Curiel ordered some documents in one case involving the school to be unsealed, Trump called Curiel ""hostile"" and ""a hater"" and said he believed the judge was Mexican.Curiel is an American who was born in East Chicago, Indiana, and graduated from the Indiana University School of Law.
Schneiderman, re-elected as attorney general in 2014, dismissed a question about Trump's allegation that Curiel's ruling was politically motivated, saying that in three individual cases against the university, ""every judge has said these are valid fraud claims.""""He's taking it to New York's highest court for one more round of appeals, but no judge has dismissed this,"" Schneiderman said.Asked about Trump's efforts to downplay the case,  Schneiderman called it ""hugely important"" for the way it cast Trump as ""someone who is absolutely shameless in his willingness to lie to people.""
He blasted some of the university's specific tactics, including the way instructors would persuade students to ask their credit card companies for an increased credit limit as a step toward being successful in real estate, and then persuade them to use it to buy more Trump seminars.""It was shameless, it was heartless, it's important information to get out there,"" Schneiderman said.

By Scott Malone
| BOSTON

BOSTON Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker said on Tuesday he is ready to sign a transgender rights bill if it passes in its current form in the state House of Representatives amid an acrimonious debate across the United States about the issue.Baker, a socially liberal Republican, had come under fire this year for refusing to say whether he would approve the bill, which would ban discrimination against transgender people in public restrooms and other public buildings. It passed the state Senate last month.""No one should be discriminated against in Massachusetts because of their gender identity,"" Baker said in a statement. ""I would sign the House version in its current form should it reach my desk.""
The Massachusetts House is due to vote on the measure on Wednesday. It is expected to pass by a wide margin in the Democratic-controlled chamber.The House version of the bill differs from the version passed by the Senate in that it directs the state attorney general to issue guidelines to law enforcement on how to handle people who claim transgender rights ""for an improper purpose.""
That language is a nod to one of the main concerns of opponents of people using bathrooms or locker rooms that do not correspond with their birth gender - that sexual predators will claim transgender status to access potential victims.The measure would make liberal-leaning Massachusetts the 18th U.S. state to prohibit discrimination based on gender identity.
The issue of transgender rights has become the latest front in America's culture wars. Some supporters of the Massachusetts measure described it as a rebuke to a law put in place in March in North Carolina prohibiting people from using bathrooms that do not correspond to the sex on their birth certificates.
