By Timothy Aeppel
| CUIDAD JUAREZ, MEXICO

CUIDAD JUAREZ, MEXICO Both U.S. presidential candidates routinely criticize free-trade deals they blame for the loss of American jobs.But tweaking the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as Hillary Clinton has pledged to do, or ripping it up, as Donald Trump demands, may do nothing to help companies like Element Electronics Corp, which owns America's last television factory. Winnsboro, South Carolina-based Element, and the television industry more broadly, offer a window into the complexity of industrial supply chains and illustrate why pushing manufacturing jobs back to the United States is so difficult.Element's plant in South Carolina is nearly identical to a rival factory operated by Taiwanese conglomerate Tatung Company that sits on a dusty back street in this Mexican border town. Both import nearly all their components from Asia. The parts often flow in through the same southern California ports.But there's a big, and costly, difference. The Mexican plant, by sitting just over the border from El Paso, Texas, doesn't have to pay duty on those parts, even when the finished televisions are sold in the United States. But Element's factory has to foot the tariff bill, which makes its televisions more expensive. (For a graphic on the trade loophole, click tmsnrt.rs/2ep5QMy )""It's pretty crazy that I'm disadvantaged for using U.S. labor,"" says Michael O'Shaughnessy, Element's president.That's a sentiment that Trump, the Republican nominee, has forcefully tapped as he makes the case that radically revamping the trade deal would level the playing field and bring jobs back. Many trade experts, though, say it would be a costly disaster to try to unravel these production networks, which essentially treat Mexico as a 51st state. The Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank that favors free trade, released a study last month that predicted imposing stiff tariffs on Mexico and China would disrupt North American producers that have created global supply chains and push the United States into a recession.""The TV industry is characterized by particularly dense webs of cross-border supply chains with Mexico and China,"" says Marcus Noland, the economist who directed the study. ""There'd be chaos and a trade war.""Even many who oppose NAFTA acknowledge it would be disruptive to suddenly erect barriers, given the way companies have shifted supply chains to integrate Mexico.NAFTA'S LEGACY     

NAFTA, implemented in 1994, forged a common market between the United States, Mexico and Canada. In response, many industries, including television manufactures, have transformed themselves by creating supply chains that crisscross the border. Televisions once were produced in the United States and elsewhere with hundreds of parts, often tucked into elaborate wooden cases. A modern flat screen, by contrast, has relatively few parts, and more than 70 percent of its value is packed into the glass and the electronics integrated directly into the panel.The heart of the industry, including that core glass technology and production, is now based in Asia.About half of all TVs imported to the U.S. come from Mexico, says Paul Gagnon, an expert on the industry's supply chain at IHS Markit, an economic research firm. ""The main reason for that is so the producers can respond quickly to fluctuations in demand,"" he says. TV sales are highly seasonal, spiking late in the year. In Mexico, some of the factories double their workforce for just a few months to respond to this.Gagnon doubts the jobs would come back to the United States, because margins on TVs are so low. ""If there were any major cost increase (in Mexico), you'd probably see some shift to Asia for production -- rather than seeing that production happen in the U.S.""
Some Mexican plants mold the plastic casing and do other tasks in the assembly process. But in many cases -- including at both the Element and Tatung plants -- the assembly plants do mostly finishing touches like inserting printing circuit boards and tuning the units. This creates relatively few jobs compared to the kind of television manufacturing done in the U.S. industry's heyday.In the 1950s, there were some 150 domestic television manufacturers in the United States, and employment peaked at about 100,000 in the 1960s.Mexico's cost advantage over the United State is formidable. O'Shaughnessy said he pays his 200 workers, who operate in a converted shirt factory, about $15 an hour. The pay at the Juarez plant is about $2.50 an hour.Even with this edge, it's getting harder to do the work in Mexico, said Chan-hsing Diao, manager of the Tatung plant. (Tatung doesn't sell televisions under its own name, but rather is paid by other manufacturers to assemble their name-brand products.)""The industry is consolidating and the cost pressures are enormous,"" he said, noting that over the last six years, the amount he is paid to assemble a 32-inch television has fallen by half, from about $6 a unit to $3 a unit.""The profits are this,"" he said, holding up two fingers almost touching.
The Tatung plant in Juarez occupies a cavernous space that was once a windshield factory. It now features long assembly lines for televisions and produced 15 million TVs over the last seven years, Diao said. Some 13 million of those were sold in the United States.In January, the company lost its main customer, a Chinese TV manufacturer that Diao declined to identify. Tatung is scrambling to find a new manufacturer that wants to build TVs for the United States. In the meantime, it continues assembling TVs for Mexico and some other Latin American markets.Diao warned there would be a trade war if a new U.S. administration tore up the NAFTA agreement. With profits already so tight in Mexico, many Chinese producers might find it easier to ship finished goods directly from Asia rather than move production and jobs to the United States, he said.IN SEARCH OF AN EXEMPTION    
O'Shaughnessy, for his part, said he just wants to get the same break on import duties as Mexico gets under NAFTA. His decision to build in the United States, he said, was driven entirely by his only customer for the U.S. plant, Wal-Mart, which uses Element as a centerpiece of its campaign to promote domestic manufacturing. The South Carolina TVs are shipped in boxes emblazoned with American flags and bearing the words ""Assembled in the USA.""O'Shaughnessy has appealed for a tariff exemption from his local congressman, Rep. Mick Mulvaney, a Republican. Mulvaney said he is sympathetic but has been unable to win over many fellow lawmakers who consider special exemptions a form of earmarks for special interests, which many oppose on principle.""Element makes clear the real world implications of these trade deals we have signed,"" said Mulvaney, adding that it's time to ""review"" NAFTA to iron out this and other loopholes.   Back in Juarez, the annual ramp-up of hiring is under way at the Tatung plant to supply the surge of televisions bought over the holidays. Employment at Tatung goes as low as 280 each year, for instance, but is now on its way up to 600, Diao said.""You could never do that in America -- at least not easily,"" he says, referring to this cycle of hiring and firing large numbers.

By David Brunnstrom and Manuel Mogato
| WASHINGTON/MANILA

WASHINGTON/MANILA U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is confident after speaking to his Philippine counterpart that the two countries can ""work through"" a period of confusion caused by anti-American rhetoric from President Rodrigo Duterte, the State Department said on Monday.State Department spokesman John Kirby said Kerry expressed concern in his conversation on Sunday with Foreign Minister Perfecto Yasay about the tone of remarks by the Philippine president, who has sharply criticized President Barack Obama and talked of separation from Washington.At the same time, Kerry emphasized strong and stable ties between the longtime allies, while Kirby said Washington had seen no practical action by Manila to move away from those.Kerry's conversation with Yasay came after Duterte provoked alarm last week by announcing a ""separation"" from the United States and realignment with China during a visit to Beijing.Although Duterte said later he did not really mean separation, his remarks added to concerns about the future of a U.S.-Philippine military cooperation pact seen as crucial to projecting U.S. power in Asia in the face of fast-rising China.Earlier on Monday, the most senior U.S. diplomat for Asia,  Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia Daniel Russel, said in Manila that Washington remained a ""trusted"" ally to the Philippines and supported its blossoming ties with China.
Russel was the first high-level visitor from Washington since Duterte's remarks and Kirby said that both Russel and Kerry made clear the United States had every intention of continuing to meet its security commitments to the Philippines.""The tone and tenor of the discussions that they had ... and the assurances that the Philippine side gave to their commitment to keeping the relationship going was enough to lead the secretary and the assistant secretary to believe that we were going to be able to work through this,"" Kirby told a regular news briefing. 
'REAL CLIMATE OF UNCERTAINTY'
In his comments to reporters, Russel said he had candidly told Yasay that Manila's friends were concerned about the high loss of life in Duterte's campaign against drugs and reiterated the importance of due process.Russel said ""a real climate of uncertainty about the Philippines' intentions had created consternation in many countries,"" including the United States. He said that worry extended beyond governments to corporate boardrooms and warned that it was ""bad for business"" in ""a very competitive region.""
Since Duterte took office on June 30, he has been scathing about U.S. criticism of his anti-drug campaign, in which about 2,300 people have been killed. But his ministers have repeatedly sought to soften his more outspoken remarks.Explaining Duterte's ""Goodbye America"" remarks, Yasay said on Saturday the United States remained the ""closest friend"" of the Philippines but that Manila wanted to break away from a ""mindset of dependency and subservience"" and forge closer ties with other nations.Russel said Duterte himself had ""already walked back"" his remarks and added that Washington supported direct dialogue and negotiations between the Philippines and China. ""We don't want countries to have to choose between the U.S. and China,"" he said.

By Roberta Rampton

 (This October 24 story has been refiled to say ""go"" instead of ""do"" in second paragraph)By Roberta RamptonLOS ANGELES President Barack Obama on Monday trolled Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump - known for his prolific use of Twitter to settle scores - making Trump the punch line for jokes on ABC's late-night show ""Jimmy Kimmel Live.""Obama read aloud a series of ""mean tweets"" culminating in one from Trump: ""President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States!""""At least I will go down as a president,"" Obama said.Kimmel joked that Obama had to ""take time away from helping rig the election"" to appear on the show, a dig at Trump, who has repeatedly said the Nov. 8 vote is rigged against him.Obama picked up on the joke while describing how comedian Bill Murray beat him in a contest to putt golf balls into a glass in the Oval Office during a recent visit - a stunt the White House designed to promote Obamacare health insurance.""He won repeatedly,"" Obama said. ""The glass was rigged!""
Kimmel asked Obama, ""Do you ever laugh"" when watching Trump on television. ""Most of the time,"" Obama said.Obama also revealed he has been called on a special phone by his bed ""three or four times"" in the middle of the night during his time in office to deal with emergencies, including when the 2011 tsunami hit Japan.But he said he does not reach for his smartphone in the wee hours - another dig at the Republican candidate.""I don't tweet at 3 a.m. about people who insult me,"" Obama said.
Obama's second and final term ends on Jan. 20. Under the U.S. constitution, presidents are limited to two terms - which is just as well, Obama said.""If I were able to run for a third term, Michelle would divorce me,"" he said, noting his wife does not like politics.Not all the jokes were at Trump's expense. Comedian Will Farrell channeled deceased but beloved Chicago Cubs sportscaster Harry Caray to recommend that Obama ""open a shrimp shack"" after he leaves office.And Joel McHale feigned outrage when told he had been bumped from the show for Obama.
""You got the president, huh. Wow, that's a big deal - he's got two months left in the job,"" McHale said, oozing sarcasm.""That's a real good get there, Jimmy: Lame! Duck!"" McHale said. (Reporting by Roberta Rampton; Editing by Leslie Adler)"

The average premium for benchmark 2017 Obamacare insurance plans sold on Healthcare.gov rose 25 percent compared with 2016, the U.S. government said on Monday, the biggest increase since the insurance first went on sale in 2013 for the following year.The average monthly premium for the benchmark plan is rising to $302 from $242 in 2016, the Department of Health and Human Services said. The agency attributed the large increase to insurers adjusting their premiums to reflect two years of cost data that became available.The government provides income-based subsidies to about 85 percent of people enrolled, and those credits will increase with the higher premiums. It said 72 percent of consumers on HealthCare.gov will find plans with a premium of less than $75 per month.Large national insurers including Aetna Inc (AET.N), UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) and Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) have said they are losing money on the exchanges, created under President Barack Obama's national healthcare reform law, because patient costs are higher than anticipated and enrollment is lower than forecast. Both UnitedHealth and Aetna have pulled out of the exchanges for 2017.As a result, consumers will have fewer plans to choose from. In 2017, in five states there will be offerings from only one insurance company. The government expects average monthly 2017 enrollment of 11.4 million people, up about 1 million from 2016.
Obama acknowledged last week that the law is not working perfectly but said the problems could be fixed if lawmakers created a government-run health insurance option that would help U.S. states where there is little or no competition.Premium increases have become fodder for the presidential race, as Republican candidate Donald Trump calls for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act if he is elected and Democrat Hillary Clinton calls for expanding it.
The news ""shows why the entire program must be repealed and replaced .... Mr. Trump knows the only way to fix our nation's failing health care system is complete and total reform,"" said Trump communications adviser Jason Miller.The government agency said the 2017 premium increase comes after two years of very low increases in the marketplace for the second-lowest cost ""silver"" plan, the benchmark plan used to calculate cost-sharing subsidies. 
Average premiums for the silver plan increased 2 percent in 2015 and were up 7 percent in 2016, the agency said.The figure reflects premiums on Healthcare.gov, the federally run website that sells plans for about two-thirds of the states. Including four states and the District of Columbia, which run their own insurance marketplaces, and those that have reported data, the average premium rose 22 percent, the agency said.

By David DeKok
| NORRISTOWN, Pa.

NORRISTOWN, Pa. Former Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane was sentenced on Monday to serve 10 to 23 months in county jail for leaking confidential grand jury information and then lying about it to investigators.Kane, 50, the first woman and first Democrat ever elected Pennsylvania attorney general, was convicted in August on charges of perjury, false swearing, obstruction of justice, official oppression and conspiracy. She resigned two days after the jury in Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas handed down its verdict.In addition, Judge Wendy Demchick-Alloy sentenced Kane to eight years of probation.""A lesser sentence will depreciate the seriousness of the crimes of this defendant,"" she said. Kane, who intends to appeal her conviction, had faced a maximum sentence of 24 years in state prison.Her lawyer, Marc Steinberg, was not available to comment after the hearing.
Kane was accused of giving information from a grand jury proceeding in 2013 to a Philadelphia Daily News reporter to retaliate against a former state prosecutor, Frank Fina. She believed he had told the Philadelphia Inquirer about her decision to drop prosecution of a case Fina had developed against six black Democratic legislators in Philadelphia.Grand juries play an important role in the U.S. criminal justice system by deciding if a prosecutor has enough evidence to bring charges against a suspect. Secret deliberations encourage witnesses to speak without fear of retaliation and to protect the reputation of suspects when the jury decides against recommending charges.Witnesses for the prosecution said the Kane investigation had brought havoc to the attorney general's office.
""Today is another sad day for the Commonwealth and its citizens,"" Bruce Beemer, who replaced Kane, said in a statement after the sentencing. ""The Office of Attorney General is moving forward with steps to restore the public's confidence in the work that we do and the way that we do it,"" he said without specifying his office's plans.Kane is the second Pennsylvania attorney general in the past quarter-century to be convicted of crimes committed in office. In 1995, Attorney General Ernie Preate pleaded guilty to mail fraud and served a prison sentence.
More than 25 friends and members of Kane's family attended the hearing to show support. Several, including Kane's son Christopher, 15, testified as character witnesses on her behalf.Frank DeAndrea, a former police chief of Hazleton, told the judge that sending Kane to prison could amount to a death sentence if drug lords she helped convict retaliate. Demchick-Alloy said Kane had assumed that risk when she decided to commit crimes. (Editing by Frank McGurty and Lisa Shumaker)"

By Letitia Stein
| TALLAHASSEE, Fla.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. Leonard ""Roscoe"" Newton has been in and out of Florida's prisons since before he could vote, starting with a youthful conviction for burglary.He's been a free man for six years now with an important exception: he still can't vote. Newton, who is African American, is among nearly 1.5 million former felons who have been stripped of their right to vote in a state with a history of deciding U.S. presidential elections, sometimes by razor-thin margins of just a few hundred votes. Felons have been disenfranchised in Florida since 1868, although they can seek clemency to restore their voting rights.Since 2011, however, when Republican state leaders toughened the restrictions on felon voting rights, just 2,339 ex-felons have had that right restored, the lowest annual numbers in nearly two decades, according to state data reviewed by Reuters.That compares with more than 155,000 in the prior four years under reforms introduced by Governor Rick Scott's predecessor, moderate Republican governor Charlie Crist, the data shows. Crist, who was governor from 2007 to 2011, made it much easier to restore ex-felons' voting rights.""When I tried to be an effective member of the community, I saw that I was voiceless,"" said Newton, whose expectations of getting his rights restored were dashed when the rules changed under a new administration. ""I'm 45, and I have never voted.""The dramatic slowdown has stoked a racially charged debate over whether political bias taints the process of restoring felon voting rights in the largest battleground state in the Nov. 8 presidential election. Florida's toughened ban means racial minorities are disproportionately excluded from voting because of higher incarceration rates, data shows. Black voters tend to favor Democrats. ""Republicans oppose the felon vote change because they are concerned about the political implications,"" said Darryl Paulson, a conservative Republican voting rights expert who sees wide restoration of voting rights as ""a huge political advantage for the Democratic Party."" Paulson says non-violent ex-felons should have the right to vote.Almost all U.S. states deny incarcerated felons the right to vote but many restore those rights after they have completed their sentences.Over the last two decades, more than 20 states have taken action to help people with criminal convictions regain their voting rights. Since July, Virginia's governor has restored voting rights to 67,000 felons.Florida is the largest of four remaining states that strip all former felons of voting rights, accounting for nearly half of those barred from voting nationally. Along with Virginia, the others are Kentucky and Iowa.TOUGH NEW MEASURES
In March 2011, two months after he became governor, Scott reversed Crist's reforms, which had allowed many non-violent  felons to automatically get their voting rights reinstated after they had completed their sentences. Crist had also simplified the process for felons convicted of more serious crimes to regain their votes. Scott, a millionaire former health care executive, put in place new restrictions, requiring ex-felons to wait for five to seven years before applying to regain the right to vote, serve on a jury or hold elected office. He said the new rules ensured ex-felons had proven they were unlikely to offend.Florida has disenfranchised about one in five voting-age black voters, according to research collected by the Sentencing Project, a Washington-based advocacy group.That compares with about 8.6 percent of the state's non-black potential voters. Data on the Hispanic voting-age population who can't vote because of the law was unavailable, although Hispanics make up 12.5 percent of Florida's inmates.
The rates reflect racial disparities in criminal convictions. Florida's current prison population is nearly 48 percent black, more than any other racial group, although blacks are only 17 percent of the state's population.Ion Sancho, supervisor of elections in Leon County, which includes the capital city of Tallahassee, accused the Republican administration of repealing the felon voting reforms ""to reduce the number of African Americans who had their rights restored because those voters were perceived to be more Democratic voting and so therefore were targeted for elimination.""Sancho is a former Democrat who is now unaffiliated with either party.Scott and Attorney General Pam Bondi, the Republican officials who drove the 2011 policy changes, did not agree to be interviewed by Reuters or respond directly to questions on the accusations that the law is intended to influence elections. But Bondi has previously denied the policy amounts to racially motivated disenfranchisement.""For those who may suggest that these rule changes have anything to do with race, these assertions are completely unfounded. Justice has nothing to do with race,"" Bondi wrote in a 2011 newspaper editorial.Scott's office, in a statement to Reuters, said former felons need to ""demonstrate that they can live a life free of crime, show a willingness to request to have their rights restored and show restitution to the victims of their crimes"" in order to have their voting rights restored.""FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG""
Democrats have seized on the issue as a civil rights concern, regardless of the political impact, said Nell Toensmann, who chairs the Democratic Party of St. Johns County, a north Florida region of about 225,000 people dominated by Republicans.
""Yes, it does disenfranchise a lot of African Americans, but it disenfranchises a lot of white people who would be voting as Republicans as well,"" she said.The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation polling project shows a tight race in Florida. It estimates that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has a 48 percent chance of winning the state, compared to her Republican opponent Donald Trump's 42 percent.Political scientists say the voting ban can sap votes from both parties, but some research suggests that Democrats pay a steeper price.An analysis of voting patterns by race and economic status found that if the ban had not existed during the 2000 presidential election, Democrats would have had enough votes to overturn Republican George W. Bush's 537-vote victory in Florida that won him the White House.""In very close elections won by Republican candidates, felon disenfranchisement could be decisive,"" said Christopher Uggen, a University of Minnesota professor who led the study.""IF I DENY, IT'S OVER""
Applying for voting rights can be difficult. Ex-felons must submit certified court documentation of each felony conviction -- documents that can be difficult to secure for those unable to spend time and money tracking down records in courthouses.Cases involving serious crimes are heard in person by a clemency board consisting of the governor and Florida's cabinet officers, in quarterly meetings in Tallahassee.During a Sept. 21 meeting in a windowless room in the Florida Capitol building, 48 petitions to restore voting rights were on the agenda presented to the governor and three state officers in an all-day session punctuated by tears and emotional pleas. Some petitioners were represented by attorneys, others showed up solo or accompanied by a friend or relative.
""Clemency is an act of mercy. There is no right or guarantee,"" Scott told them, urging applicants to accept culpability.State rules give him the deciding vote.""If I deny, it's over,"" he said.Learlean Rahming approached the podium in a black and white flowered dress, accompanied by her adult daughter. State records show dozens of criminal charges over two decades that include larceny, drug possession and shoplifting.""I accept my responsibility for all of my stupid mistakes of the past,"" said the 63-year-old woman, who had traveled from Miami, adding that she has been out of prison for more than 20 years.Officials were impressed by her turnaround story, until Bondi noticed a discrepancy. Records showed Rahming had voted under a married name after her release. ""Just to see if I could vote,"" she told the panel, explaining that for many years she had not realized that her rights were taken away.Scott moved to deny. Rahming left, wiping tears.    The board ultimately cleared 23 residents to get back their civil rights.More than 10,500 applications are still pending.Crist, the former governor who championed leniency, switched to the Democratic Party in 2012. In an interview, he questioned whether the policy changes on felons voting cost him a 2014 bid to reclaim the governor's mansion.He lost by about 64,000 votes - in the ballpark of the number of people in the state who complete felony sentences in a typical year, Florida Department of Corrections data shows.""We will never know for sure,"" Crist said.<^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Felons face tougher road to Election Day    tmsnrt.rs/2dsol2q)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> (Editing by Jason Szep and Ross Colvin)"

By Scott Malone
| BOSTON

BOSTON The exceptionally negative tone of this year's race for the White House is souring young Americans, turning some away from the democratic process just as the millennial generation has become as large a potential bloc of voters as the baby boomers.Reuters/Ipsos polling shows that Americans aged 18 to 34 are slightly less likely to vote for president this year than their comparably aged peers were in 2012. Some political scientists worry that this election could scar a generation of voters, making them less likely to cast ballots in the future.Young Americans on the left and right have found reasons to be dissatisfied with their choices this year. Senator Bernie Sanders had an enthusiastic following of younger people before he lost the Democratic primary race to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. On the Republican side, some are unwilling to vote for Donald Trump, citing the New York businessman's sometimes insulting rhetoric on women, minorities and immigrants.Brandon Epstein, who turned 18 on Monday, had looked forward earlier in the year to casting his first vote for Sanders. Now, the resident of suburban Suffolk County, New York, plans to sit out the vote on Election Day, Nov. 8.""It's because of the selection of the candidates. I find them to be not just sub-par, but unusually sub-par,"" said Epstein, a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. ""Something's gone terribly wrong.""That sentiment is broadly reflected in poll data that show that young Americans are less enthusiastic about their choices in November than they were four years ago when Democratic President Barack Obama faced a re-election challenge from Republican Mitt Romney.
Some 52.2 percent of respondents aged 18 to 34 told Reuters/Ipsos they were certain or almost certain to vote, compared with 56.1 percent who reported that level of certainty at the same point in 2012.The national tracking poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It included 3,088 people between 18-34 years old who took the survey from Oct. 1 to Oct. 17, and 2,141 18-34 year olds who took the poll on the same days in 2012. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points for both groups.'DEEP CYNICISM'

For at least the past half century, young Americans have voted at lower rates than their elders. But this year's decline in enthusiasm is of particular concern because it comes as the millennial generation - people born from 1981 through 1997 - has become as large a bloc of eligible voters as the baby boomers - born between 1946 and 1964. Each group's number of eligible voters is approaching 70 million people, according to the Pew Research Center.""This generation has never trusted the government, Wall Street or the media less,"" John Della Volpe, director of polling at Harvard University's Institute of Politics, said of the millennials. ""That's likely to result in turnout of less than 50 percent and of those who do turn out, there is still a deep cynicism regarding the impact of their vote, whether or not it will make a difference.""The projected low turnout is a particular concern given recent research showing how important habit is in encouraging voter participation. Put simply, a person who votes in one election is about 10 percent more likely to vote in the next than an eligible voter who opted to stay home, said Alexander Coppock, an assistant professor of political science at Yale University.
""If you extend that logic, if you have an election that fails to turn people on to voting, you'd expect that you wouldn't get that cumulative effect,"" said Coppock, whose article ""Is Voting Habit Forming?"" was published in this month's issue of the American Journal for Political Science.However, not all young voters unhappy with their choices will be staying home. Some plan to cast a ballot anyway, even if only in protest, rather than sitting out.That group includes Cameron Khansarinia, a 20-year-old vice president of the Harvard Republican Club, who said he would cast a ballot even though he opposed Trump.""I will definitely vote, I just don't know if I will be writing someone in or voting for (Libertarian) Gary Johnson or even voting for Hillary Clinton when it gets down to it,"" said Khansarinia, who is registered to vote in heavily Democratic California. ""Once this is over, come Nov. 9, we will need people here to rebuild the party."" (Reporting by Scott Malone; Editing by Frances Kerry)"

By Grant Smith
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK U.S. oil and gas industry workers have contributed only slightly more money to the campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton than to Republican Donald Trump since the two clinched their parties' nominations for the White House, according to Reuters' review of federal disclosures.The nearly even support suggests ambivalence in the industry between two rivals who have put forward wildly different energy visions. Trump calls for a drastic reduction in regulations to bolster drilling, while Clinton advocates tougher environmental protections and more renewables.Employees in the industry gave Clinton $114,141 and Trump $99,302 since July 1, Reuters found in reviewing individual campaign contributions exceeding $200 and donations funneled through their joint fundraising committees. Both were officially nominated by their parties in mid-July.Several oil and gas industry employees reached by Reuters said they did not donate just because of the candidates' energy policies. Most requested anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the election.""I am moved by the disturbing nature of what I see in Trump's vision for America on trade, the economy and national security,"" said American Gas Association head Dave McCurdy, who has contributed to Clinton's campaign.
He added, however, that he agreed with Clinton on reducing carbon dioxide emissions blamed for climate change and felt natural gas would play a role in that effort.The association has not endorsed a candidate.
Continental Resources Inc Chief Executive Officer Harold Hamm, who has contributed repeatedly to Trump's campaign, has argued in favor of the candidate's energy policies. Hamm has said bolstering U.S. drilling would reduce dependence on Middle East oil, whose proceeds he says finance terrorist attacks.A Continental official did not respond to a request for comment from Hamm.An energy lobbyist based in Washington said he understood the industry's ambivalence. ""Clinton is pro-regulation, which hurts,"" he said, requesting anonymity. ""And Trump has no record in the industry, so there's no evidence he understands the issues."" 
Clinton had far exceeded Trump in campaign contributions from industry employees during the primaries, but donations to the Republican side of the ledger were split among a much larger number of candidates than on the Democratic side.During the Republican primaries, the industry had taken an early liking to former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, giving him more than all his rivals combined, before he dropped out of the race in February.

NEW YORK Donald Trump rode to the top of the Republican ticket promising a ""big, beautiful, powerful"" border wall with Mexico to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants. Along that border, however, Americans are more likely to call the wall a ""waste of money"", according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll.The results show that while the New York businessman may have expected his tough stance on immigration to fire up support nationally, it seems to be falling short in a state heavily affected by illegal immigration, and where he is now facing a surprising challenge from his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.Asked if a wall would be ""an effective barrier or a waste of money,"" 47 percent of Arizona residents picked ""waste of money"" and 34 percent picked ""effective barrier"", with the rest picking neither, according to the poll. Among Republicans, 21 percent picked ""waste of money"" and 57 percent picked ""effective barrier.""Most Arizonans also believed it is not realistic to expect Mexico to pay for the wall, something Trump has vowed would happen if he's elected president on Nov. 8, according to the poll.The results lined up closely with nationwide opinions of Trump's immigration policy: 49 percent of American adults say the wall would be a ""waste of money"" and 31 percent say it would be an ""effective barrier.""""As big and powerful, as rich as this nation is, we cannot just leave the door open,"" said Tony Estrada, Santa Cruz County Sheriff, who has served in law enforcement in the border county for 49 years. ""But, we need a realistic and humane process. Donald Trump is ... catering to people's fear.""
Polls show Arizona, a state that has voted Democrat only once in a presidential election since 1952, has become competitive. The Real Clear Politics average of polls showed Clinton ahead there by 1.3 percentage points. Reuters/Ipsos polling shows Trump ahead there by 4 points. Clinton's campaign said last week it would spend $2 million more campaigning in Arizona before the election.
DRIVING LATINOS TO THE POLLS
Arizona's border with Mexico is 370 miles long, covering an isolated desert terrain that has drawn millions seeking to cross illegally. The state's number of undocumented immigrants has fallen 35 percent from a 2007 peak to 325,000, according to the Pew Research Center, as Arizona cracked down on that population. Nationwide, the number has dropped 9 percent from a high in 2007 to 11.1 million undocumented immigrants.Wendy Cornacchio, a 45 year-old Trump supporter from Phoenix, said she believes illegal immigration is still a problem - but she would rather see technologies like drone surveillance than Trump's wall to address it.  ""I don't think that necessarily building a wall will work, but the concept of closing the borders I agree with,"" she said.
Florida is another closely-fought state that has seen large levels of illegal immigration, though by sea rather than by land. Some 41 percent of voters there said they believed Trump's wall would be a ""waste of money"", while 36 percent thought it would be an ""effective barrier"".Progressive activist groups in both Florida and Arizona have been using Trump's hard line on immigration against him to mobilize Latinos for Clinton, who advocates a path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants. Mi Familia Vota, for example, says they registered more than 15,000 people in Arizona this year.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English and Spanish in Arizona and Florida. The Arizona poll ran from Oct. 5 to Oct. 19 and gathered responses from 2,600 people. The Florida poll ran from Oct. 5 to Oct. 12 and gathered responses from 2,610 people. Both polls have a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points for the total group and 3 percentage points for likely voters.

LAS VEGAS President Barack Obama on Sunday campaigned in the battleground state of Nevada for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate he wants to succeed him in the White House - but he spent most of his time talking about the state's Senate race.Democrats badly want to get back control of the Republican-controlled Senate in the Nov. 8 election, and are sending Obama, Michelle Obama and Joe Biden to states where close races could tip the balance.In Nevada, Obama reserved most of his firepower for mocking three-term Republican U.S. Representative Joe Heck, who had supported his party's presidential candidate until earlier this month when Donald Trump's campaign went into crisis mode by the release of a video in which he lewdly bragged about groping and kissing women.""I understand Joe Heck now wishes he never said those things about Donald Trump, but they're on tape, they're on the record,"" Obama said, using Heck's earlier praise of Trump against him.It's not just the Senate. Obama wants to capitalize on his high approval rating to help elect more Democrats to the House of Representatives, and has also endorsed about 150 candidates in state legislative races.At an intimate fundraising dinner in La Jolla, California, on Sunday evening, where tickets started at $10,000, Obama urged about 60 guests to help elect Democratic congressional candidate Doug Applegate, a former Marine colonel who is challenging Republican incumbent Darrell Issa.
""As far as I can tell, (Darrell) Issa's primary contribution to the United States Congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere,"" Obama said.Issa, the former head of the House Oversight Committee, led a series of headline-grabbing investigations into Obama's administration - but has featured a photo of Obama signing legislation on a campaign brochure.""Now that is the definition of chutzpah!"" Obama said.Last week, Obama excoriated Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida - who has a narrow lead over Democratic challenger Patrick Murphy, a congressman - for failing to repudiate Trump.
In the final two weeks leading up to Nov. 8, Clinton said she planned to work hard to support congressional and state races.""We're going to be emphasizing the importance of electing Democrats down the ballot,"" Clinton told reporters traveling with her on Saturday.In Las Vegas, Obama was introduced by the Democratic Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto, a two-term Nevada attorney general, who would be the first Latina elected to the U.S Senate if she wins.
""We can't elect Hillary and then saddle her with a Congress that is do-nothing, won't even try to do something,"" Obama said.The Nevada Senate seat is the only Senate race this year that Republicans could flip to their control. The seat has long been held by Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader, who is retiring.Cortez Masto currently has a slim 2.3 percentage point lead in an average of polls tracked by RealClearPolitics over Heck.Obama won Nevada in 2008 and 2012. Polls show Clinton with a 4.2 percentage point lead at 45.4 percent support to Trump's 41.3 percent, according to the RealClearPolitics average.
