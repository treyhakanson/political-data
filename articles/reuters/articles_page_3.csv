By Timothy Gardner
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The Obama administration on Friday blocked new exploration for oil and gas in Arctic waters, in a win for environmental groups that had fought development of the ecologically fragile region.The Department of the Interior released a 2017 to 2022 leasing plan that blocked drilling in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas off northern Alaska. It also limited petroleum development in the Cook Inlet off south-central Alaska. Environmental activists have battled drilling in Alaska to protect whales, walruses and seals, and as part of a broader movement to keep remaining fossil fuels in the ground.The Interior Department said the plan was ""balanced,"" and left 70 percent of economically recoverable oil and gas resources open to drilling, mostly in the Gulf of Mexico.The plan focuses on the best areas ""with the highest resource potential, lowest conflict and established infrastructure - and removes regions that are simply not right to lease,"" Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said. 
President Barack Obama, who last year became the first sitting president to cross the Arctic Circle, has made fighting climate change and protecting the Arctic priorities in his administration.But President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican who takes office on Jan. 20, 2017, has vowed to open resources to petroleum development and could take steps to reverse the decision.Oil interests have pressured the administration to explore for energy in the Arctic. Jack Girard, the head of the American Petroleum Institute industry group, said the decision ""puts the U.S. at a serious competitive disadvantage.""
Russia and Norway have also explored the Arctic, though Exxon Mobil wound down drilling in the Russian north in 2014 due to U.S. sanctions over Moscow's aggression in eastern Ukraine.Fierce winds and frigid waters make the Arctic treacherous for drilling equipment. After spending billions of dollars to explore the Alaskan Arctic, Royal Dutch Shell retreated in 2015 after suffering a gash in one of its ships and environmentalists had uncovered details of an old law that forced the company to cut exploration there by half. 
The U.S. Coast Guard complained when Shell was drilling off Alaska that it had been forced to divert resources, including a vessel that fought cocaine trafficking, to keep operations in the region safe. (reut.rs/2g4yHSW)Environmentalists applauded the new lease plan, which built on a similar decision in March when the government removed much of the Atlantic ocean from oil and gas leasing for five years.""This is excellent news for our oceans, from the Arctic to the Atlantic,"" said Jacqueline Savitz, deputy vice president for U.S. campaigns of Oceana, an international advocacy group.

| BERLIN

BERLIN U.S. President Barack Obama and European leaders on Friday underscored the importance of working together in NATO and chided Russia for its bombing of Syria and failure to implement a Ukrainian peace accord.The White House statement followed a meeting at which Obama sought to reassure his counterparts from Germany, Britain, Spain, Italy and France that his successor Donald Trump would not break up the transatlantic alliance.Trump raised concerns during the campaign when he said he could withhold military aid from NATO allies if they had not met their defense commitments and said he would forge closer ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.""President Obama expressed confidence that, even at a moment of great change, democratic values have done more to advance human freedom and progress than any other system in history, and will continue to do so going forward,"" the White House said.The leaders agreed on the need to work together to stabilize the Middle East and North Africa, as well as securing diplomatic resolutions for the conflicts in Syria and eastern Ukraine.European leaders had sought Obama's support as they prepare to extend sanctions imposed on Russia by Washington and Brussels in 2014 following its intervention in eastern Ukraine, and consider fresh sanctions over Russia's actions in Syria, where it backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a news conference with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy that no decisions had been made about extending the Ukraine sanctions, but actions to implement the Minsk peace accord were not sufficient.Merkel said the leaders discussed their concerns about Syria during their meeting on Friday, but did not talk about imposing Syria-related sanctions against Russia that have been sought by the Syrian opposition.Obama and the EU leaders called for an immediate end to attacks on rebel-held parts of the city of Aleppo by Syrian government forces and their allies Russia and Iran that monitoring groups say have killed dozens this week alone.
Syrian opposition officials on Friday met EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and other officials and urged them to focus on protecting civilians and lifting the siege, said Anas al-Abdah, who heads the Syrian National Coalition.He said he had hoped for stronger words from Obama and the EU leaders, and called for Washington and Brussels to put more ""real pressure"" on Russia and Iran.U.S. and EU officials have stressed the need for a political solution, including the departure of Assad, but Trump has said he views the fight against Islamic State as a bigger priority.
EU leaders are expected to extend sanctions related to Ukraine in December or January.Obama and the European leaders ""unanimously agreed on the continued need for Russia to fully meet its commitments under the Minsk agreements and that Ukraine-related sanctions against Russia must remain in place until it does so,"" the White House said.They said a durable ceasefire in eastern Ukraine was needed to move forward with free and fair local elections in the occupied regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democratic attorneys general in at least five U.S. states have vowed to fight President-elect Donald Trump in the courts if he rolls back Obama-era regulations or adopts policies they view as infringing upon civil liberties.With Republicans controlling the White House and both chambers of Congress, the Democratic Party looks set to rely more heavily on top law officials in states they run to help keep a check on Trump's exercise of power.Any efforts by a Trump administration to weaken consumer protection or climate change policies, for example, could lead to conflict between the states and the federal government, attorney general offices in Maryland, Virginia, Washington, Massachusetts, and New York told Reuters. In some instances, that could see them asking a federal judge to block federal action nationwide. ""I view my role as being on the first line of defense against a Trump administration if it chooses to act in an unconstitutional fashion,"" said Bob Ferguson, the Democratic attorney general of Washington state.When George W. Bush was president, Democratic states forced his administration to take the first step toward regulating carbon emissions for the first time. Michael Kelly, a spokesman for Virginia's attorney general, Mark Herring, said that if a Trump administration ""crosses the line and pursues actions that are illegal or violate the Constitution, Attorney General Herring will be ready to stand up and defend the rights of Virginians.""     The Trump transition team did not respond to a request seeking comment.Attorneys general are the top legal officials in the 50 states and are typically elected. After this year's elections, 21 will be Democrats, in addition to the attorney general for the District of Columbia. Acting on behalf of their states, they generally have legal standing to bring lawsuits challenging federal regulations or executive actions, including those that may infringe upon civil rights.
""The President-elect has made a number of promises that, if implemented, would violate the Constitution or Massachusetts law,"" Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement.""If the incoming administration chooses to try to act in ways that are unconstitutional, my office will take action to protect the rights and liberties of our residents and our state,"" she said.        
SYMPATHETIC HEARING

A dozen attorney general offices contacted by Reuters declined to discuss potential legal strategies before Trump takes office.Democratic states that sue might initially get a sympathetic hearing, as many federal courts are staffed with judges appointed by President Barack Obama during his eight years in office. But challengers face one major obstacle, a Supreme Court likely soon to regain its conservative majority once Trump makes an appointment to fill a vacant seat. The court is currently divided 4-4 between conservatives and liberals.Republican-controlled Texas, which took a leading role in challenging Obama's executive actions, provides a model for the Democratic attorneys general. Climate change is likely to be area of friction between Trump, who has vowed to roll back regulations aimed at cutting greenhouse gases, and Democratic states, which have supported such efforts at the federal level or enacted their own measures.
The top target for Trump is Obama's Clean Power Plan, which seeks to limit carbon emissions from power plants.Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said his office ""will continue to fight to protect New Yorkers' public health, property, and environment, and to lead the coalition of states defending the Clean Power Plan.""Immigration policy is another potential flashpoint. Trump has said he will rescind an Obama executive order giving deportation relief to up to 4 million people and end federal funding for cities like New York and Los Angeles that give sanctuary to undocumented immigrants.    A federal court blocked the Obama executive order in February 2015 after Texas and 25 other Republican states challenged it. The Supreme Court split 4-4 on the issue in June, leaving the lower court's ruling in place.On consumer protection, states can both challenge any Trump efforts to loosen regulations and ramp up their own enforcement efforts, said Doug Gansler, a Democrat who served as Maryland's attorney general from 2007 to 2015.""If the federal government abdicates that responsibility, the more aggressive and progressive state attorneys general will fill that vacuum,"" he said.

WASHINGTON Republican U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Friday announced his selections for his top security posts, including the head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), his national security adviser and attorney general.An official with Trump's transition team told Reuters that Trump had chosen retired General Michael Flynn as national security adviser, U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions to serve as attorney general, and U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo to lead the CIA. All three accepted, the official said.     Below are details about his selections:U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: U.S. SENATOR JEFF SESSIONS  
Sessions, 69, was the first U.S. Senator to endorse Trump's presidential bid and has been a close ally since. A conservative from Alabama, he is serving his fourth term in the chamber, where he is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee with oversight of federal courts, immigration, crime and terrorism. The son of a country-store owner, he is a former Army Reserve captain and served as the U.S. Attorney for Alabama's Southern District under former President Ronald Reagan and later as Alabama's Attorney General. Although he was confirmed by the Senate for his U.S. Attorney post in 1981, he was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 when a Senate panel failed to advance his nomination amid allegations he had made racially-charged remarks, which he denied. Sessions must secure confirmation by the U.S. Senate to lead the Justice Department as attorney general, but he would only need to win majority support in the chamber, which is controlled by Republicans.
Sessions has long taken a tough stance on immigration, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. During the Republican George W. Bush administration, he blasted a bipartisan effort to create a guest-worker program for illegal immigrants backed by Bush.NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: RETIRED LIEUTENANT GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN
Flynn, 57, was an early supporter of Trump and serves as vice chairman on his transition team.A former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), he began his U.S. Army career in 1981 and served deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq. He later worked in the Office of the Director of Intelligence.       
Once a registered Democrat, Flynn became head of the DIA in 2012 under President Barack Obama and but retired a year earlier than expected according to media reports and became a fierce critic of Obama's foreign policy. He went on to launch his own consulting firm that has come under scrutiny for its ties to a Turkish businessman. He told the Wall Street Journal on Thursday that he would sever ties with the firm to serve Trump.    Flynn has said the United States should work more with Russia on global security issues. In an August interview with the Washington Post, he defended a paid speech for state-run Russian Television.    
CIA DIRECTOR: U.S. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE POMPEO
Pompeo, 52, is a third-term congressman from Kansas who serves on the U.S House Select Intelligence Committee, which oversees the CIA, National Security Agency (NSA) and cyber security. Pompeo also was a member of the House Select Committee on Benghazi investigating the 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Libya.  The California native graduated first in his class from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and served as a platoon leader in the U.S. Army before leaving military as a captain to attend Harvard Law School.In 1996, he moved to Kansas to launch an aircraft parts company. The firm's decision to open a factory in Mexico came under fire when Pompeo later ran for public office. Pompeo defended his work, saying the company had created jobs in the state. His ties to Koch Industries, owned by billionaire conservative donors Charles and David Koch, has also drawn scrutiny. He won re-election in the Nov. 8 election with 61 percent of the vote, according to Kansas's unofficial election results online.Pompeo has been critical of former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden who leaked National Security Agency information, saying in a 2014 letter that his telecast appearance at an event undermined the ideals of ""fairness and freedom.""

By Steve Holland and Kiyoshi Takenaka
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe described Donald Trump as a ""trustworthy leader"" after meeting the U.S. president-elect on Thursday to get clarity on statements Trump had made while campaigning that had caused concern about the alliance.Abe, speaking after the hastily arranged 90-minute meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan, reporters: ""The talks made me feel sure that we can build a relationship of trust."" But he would not disclose specifics because the conversation was unofficial.Trump, in a brief entry on his Facebook page accompanied by a photo of the two men, said: ""It was a pleasure to have Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stop by my home and begin a great friendship.""Japan's leadership has been nervous about the future of an alliance that is core to Tokyo's diplomacy and security.Trump had fanned worries in Tokyo and beyond with comments on the possibility of Japan acquiring nuclear arms, demands that allies pay more for keeping U.S. forces on their soil or face their possible withdrawal, and his opposition to the U.S.-led 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade pact.Abe had worked closely with President Barack Obama on the TPP trade pact, which was part of Obama's push to counter the rising strength of China and a pillar of Abe's economic reforms.""Alliances cannot function without trust. I am now confident that President-elect Trump is a trustworthy leader,"" said Abe, describing the talks as ""candid"" and held in a ""warm atmosphere"".Abe gave Trump a golf driver and received golf-wear in return, Japanese officials said.
Photographs taken inside the ornate meeting room at Trump Tower showed Abe accompanied only by an interpreter and Trump by his daughter Ivanka, her husband and Trump adviser Jared Kushner, and Retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn whom a senior Trump official said on Thursday had been offered the national security adviser position.COMMON GROUND 
Abe said he had agreed to meet again with Trump ""at a convenient time to cover a wider area in greater depth.""It was unclear if that would happen before Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump official Kellyanne Conway told CBS earlier on Thursday that ""any deeper conversations about policy and the relationship between Japan and the United States will have to wait until after the inauguration.""
Back in Tokyo, Finance Minister Taro Aso commented: ""The meeting ran longer than planned, which means that they were on the same wavelength and it went well.""Some of Trump's campaign rhetoric suggested an image of Japan forged in the 1980s, when Tokyo was seen by many in the United States as a threat to jobs and a free-rider on defense.A Trump adviser who spoke earlier in the week, however, stressed a more positive view and credited Abe with making changes.""Frankly, the prime minister has been more assertive and forthright in trying to make those changes to Japan's global posture,"" he said. 
Trump, a brash billionaire real estate magnate, and Abe, a political blue blood, share a stated desire to raise their countries' global standing and both have support from right-wing constituencies.Abe has boosted Japan's overall defense spending since taking office in 2012. He has also stretched the limits of its pacifist postwar constitution to allow the military to take a bigger global role. Japan's defense spending, though, still stands at just over 1 percent of GDP compared with more than 3 percent in the United States.Abe was expected to see Obama at an Asia-Pacific summit in Peru on the weekend. Hours before Abe and Trump met, Obama's secretary of state, John Kerry, and Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida met in Lima to discuss the Paris climate accord - a deal Trump has pledged to exit.Diplomats and analysts say that however good the atmospherics, it will be hard to assess Trump's policies on security issues ranging from overseas deployments of U.S. troops, China's maritime assertiveness and the North Korean nuclear threat until Trump makes key appointments.

She said no decision had been made yet on whether to extend those sanctions but added that progress towards implementing the Minsk peace agreement was not sufficient.

By Timothy Gardner
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Most of the U.S. coal industry doubts Donald Trump can fulfill his promise to make the ailing industry great again in a country awash in dirt-cheap natural gas, a competing fuel. But a small sub-section of the coal sector that mines metallurgical coal - a variety used by steel makers instead of power plants - is gearing up for a Trump-inspired boom.That's because the Republican president-elect has promised a spending surge for roads, bridges and tunnels after he takes office on Jan. 20, a push to upgrade America's infrastructure with the support of leading Democrats that could jolt demand for metallurgical coal from American steel mills. Prices for met coal, as it is called, have already risen in recent months on lower supply from China.""This is the best news that Appalachia as a whole has had in about 10 years,"" said Jason Bostic, a vice president at the West Virginia Coal Association, referring to Trump's infrastructure agenda. ""Suddenly there's a little bit of hope here.""Corsa Coal Corp, a producer of met coal based in Pennsylvania, was already encouraged by the China-driven price spike before Trump's victory. Now it believes U.S. politics are going its way too.""The thing that has got me the most excited is the potential for infrastructure spending,"" said George Dethlefsen, Corsa's chief executive. ""All those things are very energy- and steel-intensive, and that's good for our business.""The company  plans to boost its production of met coal by 70 percent in 2017 to around 1.2 million short tons. In the meantime, it is putting mines on a six-day-a-week schedule, up from four days, and it is looking at loading coal on its midnight shift, which it normally reserves for maintenance.Arch Coal Inc, which produces both met and steam coal used in power plants, said it was also optimistic about Trump, particularly his promise to roll back regulations. But other representatives of the steam coal industry have said regulation reversals may not overcome their main problem: plentiful and cheap natural gas following a decade-long hydraulic fracturing drilling boom.
National production figures for met coal are unavailable, since the government does not break the data out. But total U.S. coal production has fallen to its lowest level since 1986, costing the industry thousands of jobs, as low natural gas prices and President Barack Obama's emissions and water regulations took their toll.Met coal prices, however, reflect the coal sector's only major sign of life this year. They have risen to above $270 a metric ton this month from lows of $70 a ton in February, driven in part by China reducing its output.Corsa and Arch are among a very small number of U.S. met coal producers that are publicly traded, with most of the others small and privately owned. Alpha Natural Resources, which emerged from bankruptcy in July, declined to comment. 
INFRASTRUCTURE BANK
Trump's transition team is weighing an ""infrastructure bank"" to make investments in projects as part of an economic focus that also includes revamping taxes and regulation, a Trump adviser said this week.Democrats, including Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, have indicated they hope to work quickly with Trump on infrastructure. But whether they will succeed is far from certain, as many Republicans oppose spending bills.Ramaco, a private company, announced in September it will open two met coal mines in West Virginia and Virginia next year, thanks to $90 million in private equity investments that came in as global met coal prices swung upward.
Randy Atkins, the chairman and chief executive of Ramaco, said adding new mines was possible if Trump's U.S. infrastructure push succeeds but would depend on whether additional investors flock in to fund them.Banks and financial institutions are sensitive to recent bankruptcies of major coal companies - including Arch and Peabody Energy Corp - and the weak financial conditions of others, Atkins said.Jim Truman, the director of global metallurgical coal markets at research group Wood Mackenzie, said the specialized workers that would be required, such as underground electricians, could also be hard to find given coal's downturn since 2008.Phil Smith, a spokesman for the United Mine Workers of America, said the other key to the U.S. met coal industry's outlook is whether new infrastructure relies on American-made steel and coal as Trump has promised.""If we are importing the coal or importing steel made with foreign coal, then it won't make any difference for American miners,"" Smith said.

By Dan Levine

Attorneys for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will try at a court hearing on Friday to delay a civil trial involving allegations from students that they were defrauded by the now-defunct Trump University. The former students say they were lured by false promises to pay up to $35,000 to learn the New York businessman's real estate investing ""secrets"" from his ""hand-picked"" instructors. Trump owned 92 percent of Trump University and had control over all major decisions, the students' court papers said. Trump denies the allegations and has argued he relied on others to manage the business.U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel in San Diego has urged both sides to settle in advance of a trial scheduled to begin on Nov. 28. Trump's lawyers filed a motion last week asking to delay the case until after Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, saying the presidential transition was ""all-consuming.""
They also proposed that Trump's trial testimony be recorded before trial. The students opposed the request, saying Trump had already provided several hours of deposition testimony that could be presented to a jury. 
""Any delay would be a slippery slope because President-Elect Trump's life is only going to get more complicated and unpredictable as time goes by,"" they wrote.Curiel is presiding over two cases against Trump and the university. A separate lawsuit is pending, filed by New York's attorney general who has said over 5,000 students across the country were defrauded out of about $40 million.
Trump aroused controversy earlier this year when he said during his campaign that Curiel, who was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrant parents, could not be impartial because of Trump's pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.
