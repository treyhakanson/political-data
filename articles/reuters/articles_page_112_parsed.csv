By Amy Sawitta Lefevre and Roberta Rampton
| VIENTIANE

VIENTIANE The United States announced on Tuesday it would provide an additional $90 million over the next three years to help Laos, heavily bombed during the Vietnam War, clear unexploded ordnance that has killed or injured more than 20,000 people.The figure announced during President Barack Obama's first visit to Laos is close to the $100 million the United States has spent in the past 20 years on clearing its UXO in Laos.From 1964 to 1973, U.S. warplanes dropped more than 270 million cluster munitions on the communist country, one-third of which did not explode, the Lao National Regulatory Authority for UXO says.Obama became the first U.S. president to visit Laos when he arrived in the once-isolated country on Monday to attend two regional summits, half a century after America's ""secret war"" left Laos with the unfortunate distinction of being the most heavily bombed country, per capita, in history.The White House said in a statement U.S. programs in Laos had helped slash UXO casualties from 300 to less than 50 a year and the additional funding would be used for a ""comprehensive UXO survey of Laos and for continued clearing operations"".""The United States is helping Laos clear unexploded ordnance, which poses a threat to people and hampers economic development,"" it said.
The package would help support UXO victims needing rehabilitation, including orthotics and prosthetics, it added.Obama, in a speech on Tuesday in the capital, Vientiane, addressed the secret war.""As a result of that conflict many people fled or were driven from their homes,"" Obama said. ""At the time America did not acknowledge its role.""
""I believe the United States has a moral obligation to help Laos heal.""UXO remains a stubborn problem in the region and experts say it could take decades to clear landmines and bombs in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, which were beset by conflicts in the 1960s and 1970s, and in Cambodia's case, in the 1980s and 1990s too.In the central Lao province of Xieng Khouang, the area most heavily bombed by U.S. aircraft during the war in neighboring Vietnam, there is a trail of devastation.
About 80 percent of the people of landlocked Laos rely on agriculture, but some of it is simply too dangerous to farm.Approximately a quarter of its villages are contaminated with unexploded ordnance, says the British-based Mines Advisory Group, which helps find and destroy the bombs.On Wednesday, Obama is expected to visit an organization in Vientiane that works with those disabled by unexploded ordnance, the Cooperative Orthotic and Prosthetic Enterprise Visitor Center.

By Bill Trott
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Phyllis Schlafly, who became a ""founding mother"" of the modern U.S. conservative movement by battling feminists in the 1970s and working tirelessly to defeat the Equal Rights Amendment, died on Monday at the age of 92, her Eagle Forum group said.Schlafly, who lived in the St. Louis suburb of Ladue, Missouri, died at her home in the presence of her family, Eagle Forum said in a statement. The cause of death was not given.She was still a conservative force and popular speaker in her 90s, endorsing Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 and praising his policy on immigration. She was a delegate to the Republicans' convention in Cleveland.Trump said in a statement that he spoke with Schlafly a few weeks ago by telephone ""and she sounded as resilient as ever ... She was a patriot, a champion for women, and a symbol of strength.""Schlafly once called feminists ""a bunch of bitter women seeking a constitutional cure for their personal problems,"" Time said, while insisting that ""women find their greatest fulfillment at home with their family.""Her political ardor did not fade with age and in 2014, as President Barack Obama pushed for pay equity for women, Schlafly sparked controversy with a column for the Christian Post saying a man's paycheck comes first.""The pay gap between men and women is not all bad because it helps to promote and sustain marriages,"" she said. ""... The best way to improve economic prospects for women is to improve job prospects for the men in their lives, even if that means increasing the so-called pay gap.""Schlafly promoted traditional family values and once told a reporter that she always listed her occupation as ""mother"" when filling out applications. But she was hardly a typical stay-at-home housewife/mother.Shortly after marrying lawyer Fred Schlafly in 1949, she became active in Republican Party politics in Alton, Illinois, and ran unsuccessfully for Congress twice. She would go on to found the Eagle Forum grass-roots conservative group, write a newspaper column and newsletter and author some 20 books.
Her crowning achievement was crusading to prevent the Equal Rights Amendment from being added to the U.S. Constitution and it made Schlafly a leader in the modern American conservative movement.""Phyllis Schlafly courageously and single-handedly took on the issue of the Equal Rights Amendment when no one else in the country was opposing it,"" said James C. Dobson, chairman and founder of Focus on the Family. ""In so doing, she essentially launched the pro-family, pro-life movement.""Biographer Donald T. Critchlow said defeating the ERA helped usher in a conservative era in American politics and boosted Ronald Reagan to the presidency.In her decade-long fight against the ERA, Schlafly traveled across the country to speak at rallies and persuade state legislators not to approve the ERA. Along the way she often debated feminist writer Betty Freidan, who called Schlafly ""a traitor to her sex"" and once told her: ""I'd like to burn you at the stake.""
The intention of the ERA was to ensure women were treated the same as men under state and federal laws. Schlafly's attack on the proposed amendment was based on the premise that the rights of women already were well protected by the U.S. Constitution. She said the ERA actually would erode women's standing, leading to homosexual marriages, women in combat, government-funded abortions and loss of alimony.In 1972 she started the Eagle Forum, now located in Clayton, Missouri, along with Stop ERA, bringing in legions of supporters who had been regarded as non-political housewives. In a 1978 appearance at the Illinois capitol she was accompanied by backers bearing loaves of home-made bread.Described by Time magazine as ""feminine but forceful"" and with her hair always carefully styled, Schlafly said she attended 41 state hearings to testify against the Equal Rights Amendment. When the ERA's ratification deadline expired in 1982, having been approved by only 35 of the 38 states needed, Schlafly threw a party in Washington.Phyllis Stewart was born Aug. 15, 1924, in St. Louis and grew up in a home she described as Republican but not activist. She put herself through Washington University by firing weapons as an ammunition factory tester and later earned a master's degree in political science from Radcliffe. In 1978 she graduated from Washington University's law school.The left attacked Schlafly for promoting domestic life to her supporters while spending so much time pursuing her ambitious political agenda. She responded by saying she never told women they should not work.
""I simply didn't believe we needed a constitutional amendment to protect women's rights,"" Schlafly told the New York Times.Schlafly first became a political presence with her 1964 self-published book ""A Choice, Not an Echo,"" which championed the conservative politics of Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater.Schlafly also built a reputation as a strident anti-Communist and opponent of arms control treaties. After the ERA's defeat, she continued to preach conservative causes such as limited government, anti-abortion laws, traditional education, strong defense and keeping out illegal immigrants.She frequently criticized immigration reform and the Obama administration and wrote more than 25 books.Schlafly also was a critic of gay rights, which proved to be a sensitive topic in 1992 when the oldest of her six children, John, who worked for the Eagle Forum, acknowledged he was homosexual.Schlafly's husband Fred died in 1993. She is survived by six children, 16 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, Eagle Forum said.

By Steve Holland and Jeff Mason
| CANFIELD, Ohio/CLEVELAND

CANFIELD, Ohio/CLEVELAND Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton opened a final two-month sprint to the Nov. 8 election on Monday with the Republican presidential nominee suddenly looking stronger as he and his Democratic rival took their bitter fight to Ohio.Both Trump and Clinton made overtures to a news media that each candidate sees as often hostile to them, talking to reporters on their private planes. Clinton's session with reporters was her first news conference since last December.After eating a gyro at a diner in the Cleveland area, Trump rallied thousands of cheering supporters at a county fair in Canfield, and Clinton visited a brewery in Cleveland. For a time, their planes were parked about 200 yards apart at the Cleveland airport, a sign of Ohio's importance in the election.Ohio is considered one of four swing states - those that are not clearly in the Democratic or Republican camp - that could prove decisive in the Electoral College vote that will ultimately determine the winner. The other swing states are Florida, Pennsylvania and Virginia.Trump was buoyed by more polls showing him in a competitive position. The latest Reuters-Ipsos poll showed Trump with 40 percent support vs 39 percent for Clinton, effectively ending Clinton's bump up in the polls after the Democratic nominating convention. Other polls showed Clinton's lead had shrunk.""I think we've had a great month,"" Trump said.Clinton remained in a strong position to win the White House race, but Trump and his team cited his growing strength in opinion polls nationally and in several states where the election is likely to be decided to argue that his message is breaking through to voters.Clinton, who emerged into the public eye after days of raising money from wealthy donors behind closed doors, said she always knew the race would be close.""We're just going as hard and fast as we possibly can to be organized for turning out the vote, because we've always thought this was going to be hard, and that's why, you know, I'm not worried, I'm just working,"" she said.Trump, shaking his fist triumphantly, plunged into a crowd at the Mahoning County Fair where supporters had built a replica of the wall that the Republican nominee has pledged to build along the U.S.-Mexico border. 
""This has been an unbelievable reception!"" Trump said after maneuvering through a crowd of people who shouted his name, against a backdrop of food stands offering fare ranging from chicken on a stick to Italian sausages, fudge and fresh corn.Inviting reporters onto his plane for the first time since accepting the Republican presidential nomination, Trump said his focus going forward will be on how to create jobs for middle-class Americans.He has spent most of the past two weeks trying to clarify his position on illegal immigration, first flirting with a softening, then reinforcing his hardline approach, and then, on his plane, saying undocumented people might ultimately get on a path to a legal status once border enforcement steps are taken.""I'm all about the jobs now,"" he said, saying his position on the immigration issue was now well known.He also pledged to participate in all three televised presidential debates, ending speculation that he might sit out one or more if he was not happy with the format. His first face-off with Clinton is at Hofstra University in New York state on Sept. 26.Clinton made her stop at a brewery in Cleveland before heading to a nearby Labor Day parade and rally, where she tested a new jab at her opponent: ""Friends don't let friends vote for Trump."" 
The Labor Day holiday traditionally kicks off the last stretch of campaigning ahead of the November election.Speaking to reporters on her new campaign plane, she took credit for Trump's overture to the news media. Clinton, buffeted by controversy over her use of a private email server as U.S. secretary of state, has been criticized by Republicans and the news media for months for failing to hold a news conference.""I heard now that we've got this great plane, that Donald Trump actually invited his press on his plane where I'm told he even answered a few questions,"" said Clinton.TRUMP'S REBOUND

Trump's rebound from a series of self-inflicted wounds follows the hiring of a new campaign management team, and the Republican nominee is showing more discipline on the stump.Trump has been helped by what his campaign said was a positive week last week, highlighted by a quick trip to Mexico, appearing side by side with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, and a visit to a black church in Detroit.But an immigration speech that Trump gave following his trip to Mexico drew criticism from some of his Hispanic supporters, and several backers advising him on the issue decided to part ways with his campaign.Trump aide Jason Miller said rising poll numbers showed that the campaign was moving in the right direction.""The trend lines are the important thing to point to,"" Miller told Reuters. ""The problem that Clinton has is there is no positive information flow for her campaign.""Clinton, who was President Barack Obama's first-term secretary of state, appeared at few public campaign events during the latter half of August, instead raising funds at high-dollar events in the East Coast vacation spots of Martha's Vineyard and the Hamptons, and with celebrities in Los Angeles and high-tech leaders in Silicon Valley.Clinton's campaign announced that it had raised $143 million in August for her presidential bid and the Democratic Party.Clinton is again on the defensive over her use of a private email server and possible conflicts of interest with her family foundation while secretary of state, which have caused unease for some voters. But experts still see the Democratic nominee as the odds-on favorite to win the presidency.

By Nick Brown
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK The federal appointees tapped to help map Puerto Rico's economic future are technocrats more than political actors, and that could make the U.S. territory's fiscal turnaround look more like a corporate restructuring than a politically charged municipal bankruptcy in the vein of Detroit. The law known as PROMESA, which created the board when it passed the U.S. Congress in June with bipartisan support, envisioned a pragmatic solution for an island combating $70 billion in debt, 45 percent poverty and a brain drain as residents bolt in droves for the mainland United States.Its members, four Republicans and three Democrats appointed last week, were chosen by Republican and Democratic lawmakers and President Barack Obama. The board has broad powers to help stabilize the island's economy, from investigating Puerto Rico's government to working with that government on projects to spur economic growth.It must also approve the island's annual budgets, and will eventually facilitate debt-restructuring talks with creditors. In the latter endeavor, it will have to navigate a minefield of competing interests. The island has 18 separate debt issuers, backed by different revenues streams, as well as $18 billion in so-called general obligation debt backed by the ""full faith and credit"" of the territory's government. While that promise is legally weak in a bankruptcy setting, it is a sacrosanct pledge in municipal debt markets.Holders of all that debt will jockey for payouts against government vendors and beneficiaries of the island's public pensions, which have less than $2 billion in assets to cover some $45 billion in liabilities.  
Detroit's bankruptcy, which ended in December 2014, treated city pensions much better than its outstanding bonds, which were largely insured. Some Puerto Rico creditors, still suffering Detroit flashbacks, feared Puerto Rico could look similar - especially since Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla has pushed big haircuts and railed against the idea of reducing government services.But the makeup of the Puerto Rico board has offered some reassurance, said Nader Tavakoli, chief executive officer of Ambac, which insures $2.2 billion of Puerto Rican bonds and also insured some of Detroit's bonds. ""These board members are technocrats, and it gives us confidence that this is not going to be overly politicized,"" he said.Deal makers also feature prominently, with an ex-bankruptcy judge, a banker and a hedge fund operator in the mix. Republicans, generally seen as creditor-friendly, nominated a bankruptcy academic who favors restructuring the island's debt, David Skeel. And Democrats nominated a banker, Jose Ramon Gonzalez, and a Democratic finance expert in Ana Matosantos who directed California's budget under former Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Experts see the group as likely to push a solution that sees all sides share a burden, a typical approach for companies restructuring under Chapter 11.""There are no ideologues in the group,"" said Keefe Bruyette & Woods analyst Chas Tyson.    That does not mean there are not drawbacks. For one, the board will have to navigate a testy local political climate with residents who largely revile a panel they see as an extension of colonial rule. Island voters broadly unhappy with the Garcia Padilla administration in November will elect a new governor as well as members of the legislature and scores of mayors.
""There are still politics here,"" said veteran bankruptcy attorney Richard Levin, who is following the situation. ""The governor and legislature retain some authority."" For Height Securities analyst Daniel Hanson, the board is short on expertise in economic development. Any real solution for Puerto Rico requires fundamental economic changes, including at its underperforming education department, and it's unclear whether the board can facilitate such change.But from a financial perspective, at least, the board seems less inclined to promote a political agenda than figure out a collaborative fix and then get out, said Matt Fabian, partner at Municipal Market Analytics. ""The board is not being installed to fight with Puerto Ricans or to impose some kind of federal view,"" Fabian said. ""They just want these troubles to be fixed.""

WASHINGTON Conservative commentators on Sunday mistakenly accused Reuters of pulling the plug on the final moments of broadcast coverage of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's appearance at a black church this weekend.Reuters said it had no role in filming the Trump event. CBS News filmed on behalf of a pool of media companies and discontinued the feed in the final moments of Trump's appearance because of the schedule set by the campaign, according to a CBS producer involved.""The Detroit Trump footage being circulated on Twitter and elsewhere was not filmed by Reuters,"" Abbe Serphos, Reuters global head of communications, said in a statement.Despite having no involvement in filming the Saturday event, Reuters was targeted for criticism by commentators including Ann Coulter. They were apparently under the false impression that Reuters had ordered its camera operator to shut down as Trump was receiving a blessing from the pastor.Sopan Deb, a CBS journalist who was the pool producer for the event at the Detroit church, said the decision to cut off the video feed was made because Trump campaign staffers were hurrying reporters into a waiting motorcade.""I was the pool producer,"" Deb said in a tweet. ""We were forced to pack up our cameras and leave during this.""CBS News and the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday. Deb could not be reached for further comment beyond his remarks on Twitter. Coulter could not be reached.The sudden controversy was fanned by social media and came on the holiday weekend that traditionally marks the start of major campaigning for the Nov. 8 election.It followed Trump's visit to a largely black church in Detroit on Saturday, where he told the crowd his economic agenda would create jobs and educational opportunity for African-American voters as part of what he called a ""civil rights agenda for our time.""
At the end of the nearly hour-long Saturday morning service at the Great Faith Ministries church, Bishop Wayne T. Jackson draped a prayer shawl over Trump to applause from the crowd in the church.""I have prayed over this personally, and I have fasted over it,"" Jackson said.Shortly after Trump accepted the shawl, the pool feed used by broadcast networks was cut off as reporters prepared to move to the next campaign event.""How convenient that at one of the compelling moments...(the) satellite feed dropped,"" conservative radio talk show host Laura Ingraham said on Twitter.
Deb, the CBS reporter, said the suggestion of bias was ""totally inaccurate."" In a tweet responding to Ingraham, he said: ""If you want to make this an issue, please take it up with the campaign. We tried to stay and shoot this whole thing."" Ingraham could not be immediately reached for comment.In a point of contention with journalists, Trump staffers have sometimes told reporters traveling with the candidate they need to leave events before Trump if they want to avoid risking their spot in the group of reporters traveling in the motorcade with the candidate.A video posted on a website affiliated with conservative radio show host Alex Jones claimed to capture a difference of opinion between the camera operator and a producer on site about whether to continue filming the Trump event on Saturday.
Before the video cuts, one person can be heard to say, ""I'm shooting this,"" and then, almost inaudibly, ""I'll take a demotion."" A second voice says ""Shut it"" and then ""blackout,"" the site said.Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the offstage audio.""Reuters obtained the footage from third-party providers and the voices heard on the video are not Reuters staff or contractors,"" Serphos said.Trump has criticized media organizations including the Washington Post, the New York Times, CNN and others for what he has claimed are biases in their coverage of his campaign.On the day of his visit to the Detroit church, Trump lashed out at CNN. ""Great visit to Detroit church, fantastic reception, and all CNN talks about is a small protest outside,"" Trump said in a tweet.

WASHINGTON U.S. conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly died on Monday at 92. Following are some facts about her: * Schlafly said she tirelessly fought against the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution on the grounds that women were already fully protected and that the amendment  would erode women's standing, leading to homosexual marriages, women in combat, government-funded abortions and loss of alimony.She threw a party in Washington in 1982 to celebrate when the ERA proposal died, having missed its ratification deadline with approval from only 35 of the 38 required states.
* While attending Washington University in St. Louis during World War Two, Schlafly worked the night shift at an ordnance plant, firing rifles and machine guns as an ammunition tester.* Schlafly often debated feminist leader Betty Friedan, who called her ""a traitor to her sex"" and said she'd like to burn her at the stake. Schlafly said Friedan was ""always very ugly to deal with and debate and made it clear that she hated me.""
* Schlafly was a consistent foe of gay rights even though her oldest child, John, who worked for her Eagle Forum, acknowledged he was a homosexual in 1992. ""It's not a problem for anybody but the press,"" she said, adding that John is not a proponent of gay marriage.* Among the decorations in Schlafly's office were a chunk of the Berlin Wall, a ""Doonesbury"" cartoon mocking her and a necktie from Ronald Reagan, who was her favorite president in her lifetime.
* Schlafly wrote some 20 books, including ""Feminist Fantasies,"" ""The Supremacists: The Tyranny of Judges and How to Stop It,"" ""Who Will Rock the Cradle?: The Battle for Control of Child Care in America,"" ""Pornography's Victims,"" ""Child Abuse in the Classroom"" and ""Kissinger on the Couch.""

By Steve Holland
| YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio

YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio In a new twist to his immigration proposals, U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump held out the possibility of legal status for millions of illegal immigrants, but only after many other border enforcement steps are taken.Trump, in remarks to a small group of reporters whom he invited on his plane for the first time since accepting his party's nomination, said parts of his hardline immigration speech last week in Phoenix had been misinterpreted and that he had in fact softened his position to some extent.The New York businessman said that before considering how to deal with millions of illegal immigrants who are obeying U.S. laws and contributing to American society, he first wants to evict criminal elements like drug smugglers and build a border wall.Any illegal immigrants who want to gain citizenship will have to first return to their home countries first and get in line behind legal applicants, he said.But for those who stay behind, Trump said their cases would be considered at some undefined point. Asked about a potential legal status for this group, Trump did not rule it out.
""We're going to make that decision into the future. That decision will be made,"" he said. ""The first thing will be to get the bad elements out, the gang members, get 'em all out. We secure the border. We stop the drugs from coming in, because the drugs are pouring in ... We're going to build the wall. We need the wall to stop the drugs.""Such a piecemeal approach has been pushed by Republican congressional leaders over the years because it is extremely hard to get a comprehensive immigration reform bill through the U.S. Congress.Trump has struggled to strike the right tone on how he would take on illegal immigration if elected on Nov. 8. After flirting with a softer tone, he stuck to his hardline position in Phoenix last week, saying that anyone in the United States illegally would be subject to deportation.
Trump, seated with vice presidential running mate Mike Pence in tan leather seats aboard his private jet, was relaxed for a session with reporters of more than a half hour, clearly feeling better about his campaign after polls showed him closing the gap with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.Talking about his recent effort to appeal to African-American voters, Trump was asked if it was difficult to attract black voters since he has raised doubts about whether Democratic President Barack Obama was born in the United States.Trump waved off the question, saying it was an issue he did not want to get into anymore because reporters would seize on it. In 2011 while under fire from Trump, Obama produced his long-form birth certificate to prove that he was, indeed, born in Hawaii.
""I don't talk about it because if I talk about that, your whole thing will be about that,"" Trump said. ""So I don't talk about it.""He said his focus for the final two months of the campaign will be mostly about how to create jobs for struggling middle-class Americans.""I'm all about the jobs now,"" he said.Trump also pledged to participate in all three presidential debates, saying he considered it an important part of being a candidate. He also said he was fine with the moderators announced last week. (Reporting by Steve Holland)"	['Pence', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

By Jeff Mason
| HAMPTON, Ill.

HAMPTON, Ill. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Monday expressed concern about ""credible reports"" of Russian interference in the U.S. election and accused Donald Trump of being fixated on dictators including Russia's Vladimir Putin.Taking questions from reporters for more than 20 minutes on her campaign plane, Clinton said both Democrats and Republicans should be concerned about Russia's behavior.""The fact that our intelligence professionals are now studying this and taking it seriously raises some grave questions about potential Russian interference with our electoral process,"" Clinton said.""We are facing a very serious concern. We've never had a foreign adversarial power be already involved in our electoral process. ... We've never had the nominee of one of our major parties urging the Russians to hack more,"" she said.Trump, the Republican nominee, has praised Putin, the president of Russia, and has called on Moscow to dig up tens of thousands of ""missing"" emails from Clinton's time as head of the U.S. State Department. He later said his comments were meant to be sarcastic.
Clinton has previously tied Russian intelligence services to the cyber hack on the Democratic National Committee. Asked on Monday if she believed the Russian government was trying to help elect her opponent, Clinton paused.
""I often quote a great saying that I learned from living in Arkansas for many years: If you find a turtle on a fencepost it didn't get there by itself,"" she said. ""I think it's quite intriguing that this activity has happened around the time Trump became the nominee.""Clinton, a former secretary of state and a former first lady, has drawn criticism for not holding regular press conferences. On Monday she took questions on an array of topics for more than 20 minutes.Clinton dismissed concerns about her health as one of many conspiracy theories that were lobbed against her. She blamed seasonal allergies for a sustained coughing fit at an earlier event in Ohio. During the question and answer session on her plane, she also had to step away because of persistent coughing.
Clinton, whose use of a private email account during her time as secretary of state has dogged her 2016  presidential campaign, said she understood and took classification seriously when she was President Barack Obama's top diplomat.Clinton said that the attacks on her family's foundation were not rooted in fact and sidestepped a question on whether her daughter, Chelsea, should step down from the foundation's leadership if she is elected in November.
