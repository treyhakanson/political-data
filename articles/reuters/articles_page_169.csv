| BATON ROUGE, La.

BATON ROUGE, La. The U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into the fatal police shooting of a black man in Louisiana's capital, the state's governor said on Thursday, as two deadly encounters between law enforcement and black men triggered protests in the United States.The probe comes as community leaders in Baton Rouge urged authorities to conduct a full-scale criminal probe of two white police officers over the slaying of Alton Sterling, 37, on Tuesday. ""I want you to know that a criminal investigation is under way. It is being led by the U.S. Department of Justice,"" Louisiana Governor Jon Bel Edwards told hundreds of people at Living Faith Cathedral in Baton Rouge on Thursday evening. ""We are going to come out of this tragedy stronger and more united than ever,"" he added.Sterling was pinned to the ground and fatally shot in the chest outside a convenience store after the officers responded to what police said was a call about a black man reported to have made threats with a gun.The Justice Department said on Wednesday it would conduct a civil rights investigation into Sterling's death. The city's mayor and police chief welcomed the move, but community leaders said they worried the probe would be too limited and urged authorities to consider all possible federal and state criminal charges against officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake.""We don't want this to be a narrow investigation,"" Edgar Cage, a spokesman for the community organization Together Baton Rouge, said at a church earlier on Thursday. ""We plan to use this tragic event as a tool, a stimulant to change the culture.""President Barack Obama said in a statement he had full confidence in the Justice Department's ability to conduct a ""thoughtful, thorough and fair inquiry"" into Sterling's death.
Citing an unnamed law enforcement official, CNN reported on Thursday that a homeless man placed the 911 call after seeking money from Sterling, who was selling CDs outside the store.The 300-pound (135-kg) Sterling showed the man his gun and said to leave him alone, the official told CNN. Reuters could not independently confirm that account with Baton Rouge police, who did not respond to a request for comment.Sterling, a father of five, had several criminal convictions since the mid-1990s for battery, resisting arrest, burglary and other crimes. He was a registered sex offender after spending nearly four years in prison on a charge he had sex with a 14-year-old girl when he was 20.
COMMUNITY-POLICE CHASM
Sterling's death was the first of two fatal police shootings of black men in two days. Philando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer during a traffic stop on Wednesday near Minneapolis.The shootings and videos showing their bloody aftermath have sparked protests, including an overnight rally in Baton Rouge that drew about 300 people who stood in a peaceful vigil near the Triple S Food Mart where Sterling was killed.Obama said that ""all Americans should be deeply troubled"" by the two deaths, which he said were indicative of wider problems in the U.S. criminal justice system.At the Baton Rouge church on Thursday, Edwards said there would be a new focus on training and retraining in the police department, and stressed the need to introduce people to the police at an early age. 
His words appeared to address concerns voiced by many community leaders in recent days about a chasm between the black community and the police. Video recorded by a bystander's cellphone showed an officer confronting Sterling and ordering him to the ground. The two officers then tackled him to the pavement, with one pulling a gun from his holster and pointing it at Sterling's chest.One officer shot Sterling five times at close range, and the other took something from his pants pocket as he was dying, another video recorded by Abdullah Muflahi, owner of the store where Sterling was killed in the parking lot, showed.Police said Sterling was armed. Muflahi said in an interview that police took a gun out of Sterling's pocket after shooting him.Officers Lake and Salamoni have been put on administrative leave, police said. In Lake's three years and Salamoni's four years on the force, both have been cleared by the police department after prior complaints against them regarding use of force, the Advocate newspaper reported, citing records.The deaths of Sterling and Castile were the latest in a string of incidents in recent years involving police treatment of black men and boys in cities including Baltimore, Chicago, New York and Cleveland.

By Ayesha Rascoe
| WARSAW, Poland

WARSAW, Poland President Barack Obama on Friday made an impassioned plea for the nation to do more to address the combative relationship between local police forces and the black and Hispanic communities they serve, after the shootings of two black men by police in Minnesota and Louisiana in two days.""When incidents like this occur, there's a big chunk of our fellow citizenry that feels as if because of the color of their skin they are not being treated the same,"" Obama said shortly after landing early Friday morning in Warsaw, Poland, for a NATO summit.""And that should trouble all of us. This is not just a black issue. It's not just a Hispanic issue. This is an American issue that we should all care about,"" he said.The deaths of Philando Castile at a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, and Alton Sterling outside a convenience store in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were the latest in a string of shootings that have led to calls for a revamp in the way police interact with the black community.
Citing statistics that show that blacks are more likely to be killed by police officers and receive harsher sentences than their white counterparts, Obama said it is ""incumbent on all of us to say we can do better than this.""A White House task force on better policing tactics issued recommendations last year on how to improve community relations with law enforcement.Obama encouraged local police forces to adopt the practices outlined by the task force, saying that less distrust of police would help to keep officers safe and lead to less deadly shootings by authorities.
Critics of the push to reform local police tactics have charged that Obama has not shown enough concern about police officers who are shot in the line of duty.Obama repeatedly stressed that he believes that most police officers do their jobs without bias and that addressing complaints about police brutality would not undermine law enforcement.
""When people say black lives matter, that doesn't mean blue lives don't matter. It just means that all lives matter, but right now the big concern is the fact that data shows black folks are more vulnerable to these kinds of attacks,"" he said.Earlier on Thursday, Obama issued a Facebook post urging the nation to address the ""appearance or reality of racial bias"" in policing.

By Chris Prentice

The U.S. Senate on Thursday approved legislation that would for the first time require food to carry labels listing genetically-modified ingredients, which labeling supporters say could create loopholes for some U.S. crops.The Senate voted 63-30 for the bill that would display GMO contents with words, pictures or a bar code that can be scanned with smartphones. The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) would decide which ingredients would be considered genetically modified.The measure now goes to the House of Representatives, where it is expected to pass.Drawing praise from farmers, the bill sponsored by Republican Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas and Democrat Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan is the latest attempt to introduce a national standard that would override state laws, including Vermont's that some say is more stringent, and comes amid growing calls from consumers for greater transparency.""This bipartisan bill ensures that consumers and families throughout the United States will have access, for the first time ever, to information about their food through a mandatory, nationwide label for food products with GMOs,"" Stabenow said in a statement.A nationwide standard is favored by the food industry, which says state-by-state differences could inflate costs for labeling and distribution. But mandatory GMO labeling of any kind would still be seen as a loss for Big Food, which has spent millions lobbying against it.Farmers lobbied against the Vermont law, worrying that labeling stigmatizes GMO crops and could hurt demand for food containing those ingredients, but have applauded this law.    Critics like Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, say the bill's vague language and allowance for electronic labels for scanning could limit its scope and create confusion.
""When parents go to the store and purchase food, they have the right to know what is in the food their kids are going to be eating,"" Sanders said on the floor of the Senate ahead of the vote.He said at a news conference this week that major food manufacturers have already begun labeling products with GMO ingredients to meet the new law in his home state.Another opponent of the bill, Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, said it would institute weak federal requirements making it virtually impossible for consumers to access information about GMOs.
LOOPHOLES
Food ingredients like beet sugar and soybean oil, which can be derived from genetically-engineered crops but contain next to no genetic material by the time they are processed, may not fall under the law's definition of a bioengineered food, critics say.GMO corn may also be excluded thanks to ambiguous language, some said.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) raised concerns about the involvement of the USDA in a list of worries sent in a June 27 memo to the Senate Agriculture Committee.
In a letter to Stabenow last week, the USDA's general counsel tried to quell those worries, saying it would include commercially-grown GMO corn, soybeans, sugar and canola crops.The vast majority of corn, soybeans and sugar crops in the United States are produced from genetically-engineered seeds. The domestic sugar market has been strained by rising demand for non-GMO ingredients like cane sugar.The United States is the world's largest market for foods made with genetically altered ingredients. Many popular processed foods are made with soybeans, corn and other biotech crops whose genetic traits have been manipulated, often to make them resistant to insects and pesticides.""It's fair to say that it's not the ideal bill, but it is certainly the bill that can pass, which is the most important right now,"" said American Soybean Association's (ASA) director of policy communications Patrick Delaney.The association was part of the Coalition for Safe and Affordable Food, which lobbied for what labeling supporters termed the Deny Americans the Right to Know, or DARK Act, that would have made labeling voluntary. It was blocked by the Senate in March.

By Julia Edwards and David Alexander
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON FBI Director James Comey told U.S. lawmakers on Thursday that FBI employees who mishandled classified material in the way Hillary Clinton did as secretary of state could be subject to dismissal or loss of security clearance.  Comey addressed the issue at a House of Representatives committee hearing that lasted nearly five hours after House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a letter to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper that Clinton should be denied classified briefings during her campaign for the presidency.Comey, who said on Tuesday he would not recommend that the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee face criminal charges, was asked at the hearing if Clinton should face administrative punishment for the way she handled her email. ""I don't think that's for me to recommend,"" he said.Comey did say his employees in the Federal Bureau of Investigation would face discipline for the same behavior.""They might get fired, they might lose their clearance, it might get suspended for 30 days,"" Comey said. ""There would be some discipline.""Presidential candidates normally get access to classified information once they are formally nominated. As director of the FBI, Comey does not have the authority to revoke Clinton's security privileges.A group of Republican senators on Thursday asked the State Department to immediately suspend clearances for Clinton and several current and former aides based on the agency's findings. The State Department said on Thursday it would conduct an internal review of Clinton's handling of the emails now that the FBI investigation was over. The department said in April it had suspended plans for a review at the FBI's request.""I cannot provide specific information about the Department's review, including what information we are evaluating. We will aim to be as expeditious as possible, but we will not put artificial deadlines on the process,"" State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement.A Clinton spokesman on Thursday criticized the congressional hearing for its ""partisan motivations,"" and expressed confidence that Comey's testimony had shut down any lingering ""conspiracy theories"" on the matter. 
""Director Comey's testimony clearly knocked down a number of false Republican talking points and reconciled apparent contradictions between his previous remarks and Hillary Clinton's public statements,"" spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement. The issue of Clinton's use of private email servers has cast a cloud over her campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election, raising questions among voters about her trustworthiness and judgment and giving her Republican presidential rival, Donald Trump, an avenue of attack. 'APOLITICAL, PROFESSIONAL' INVESTIGATION 
Comey's testimony marked the first time he took questions publicly since his announcement the FBI was not recommending charges against Clinton. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch accepted the FBI recommendation and was to appear at another hearing next Tuesday. Comey had disappointed some Republicans by only rebuking Clinton, not recommending charges against her, for what he called her ""extremely careless"" handling of classified information while using private email servers. 
Under persistent questioning at the hearing of the House Oversight Committee, Comey said Clinton did not break the law.""The question I always look at is, is there evidence that would establish beyond a reasonable doubt that somebody engaged in conduct that violated a criminal statute. And my judgment here is there is not,"" Comey said.   Comey also said Clinton knew her email server at her home in Chappaqua, New York, was not authorized to receive classified information.But Clinton may not have had sufficiently sophisticated understanding to know the emails that passed through her personal server were classified, Comey said. Only three of the FBI-reviewed emails were explicitly marked as classified and those were marked with a ""C"" in the body of the email, not in the header, he said.Comey said his FBI team conducted its investigation of Clinton ""in an apolitical and professional way"" and he had no reason to believe she had lied to the FBI. Clinton had said publicly she never sent or received any classified information.
'IF YOUR NAME ISN'T CLINTON'
""I think there is a legitimate concern that there is a double standard, if your name isn't Clinton or you are not part of the powerful elite that Lady Justice will act differently,"" U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said to Comey at the beginning of the hearing.A Democratic member of the committee, Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, defended Comey's actions by saying: ""I firmly believe your decision was based on conviction, not convenience.""Comey, a Republican who was appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama and also served in the administration of former Republican President George W. Bush, has built a reputation as a straight shooter who does not bend to pressure from either party.He has differed sharply with the Obama administration, including over the case of General David Petraeus, who pleaded guilty after he knowingly shared classified information with his biographer and lover. Comey recommended Petraeus be charged with a felony, but then-Attorney General Eric Holder downgraded the charge to a misdemeanor.The hearing took place as Trump met with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill to get them behind his candidacy, discussing a variety of issues, including his campaign style.""I'm going to make you proud,"" Trump told House Republicans, according to a participant, Representative Bill Flores.

By Susan Cornwell and Emily Stephenson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Donald Trump endured some blunt exchanges when he met Republican members of Congress on Thursday but several lawmakers, including past critics, emerged with encouraging words about their presumptive White House nominee.Republican aides cited good attendance from both houses of Congress at the two closed-door meetings, even though some lawmakers made a point of staying away, citing previous commitments.The New York businessman-turned-politician has sought in speeches and meetings in recent weeks to unite the party behind his unorthodox candidacy and to reassure Republican leaders about his conservative credentials.In a Miami speech on Friday, Trump will say the economic policies of Democrats like President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the party's presumptive nominee, have harmed minorities, said Steve Moore, a Trump economic policy adviser.  Trump drew 41 of 54 Republican senators to the U.S. Senate meeting where he called out three senators who had been critical of his candidacy, according to Republican aides familiar with the meeting.Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort said the meetings with lawmakers were positive and productive, adding characterizations of discord ""attributed to unnamed sources, are wholly inaccurate.""  Trump also met privately with Senator Ted Cruz, his former rival for the Republican nomination. They did not discuss an endorsement but Cruz did accept Trump's invitation to speak at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland the week of July 18, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said.'I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU PROUD'
At the first session on Thursday, with members of the House of Representatives, Trump shared a hug with House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican who has often criticized Trump even while endorsing him, lawmakers said.They joked a bit about some of their past exchanges during an hour-long session, and Trump took questions.
""I'm going to make you proud,"" Representative Bill Flores quoted Trump as saying.Trump won grassroots support during months of state-by-state nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election with a pledge to ban Muslims temporarily from entering the United States and to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. He regularly annoys party leaders with inflammatory remarks.Flores, a Texan who heads the Republican Study Committee, the largest conservative grouping in Congress, had criticized Trump, including for having questioned a U.S. judge's motives because of his Mexican ethnicity. Flores had said he wanted to see ""more vision and less trash talk"" from the presumptive nominee.After Thursday's session, Flores said he felt better about Trump. ""Based on what I have heard today, I've got the confidence that you are going to see a lot more in terms of visionary messaging,"" Flores said.""Today was extremely positive,"" said New York Republican Peter King, another representative who has criticized Trump. ""There was not one negative moment.""
But not everyone was won over. ""I need to be persuaded,"" said Representative Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania who said he would not support either Trump or  Clinton.TENSIONS IN SENATE MEETING
Trump's session with Republican senators sounded more turbulent.The Washington Post reported details of a combative exchange between Trump and Senator Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who has expressed concern that Trump's comments on immigration will cause Hispanic voters in the state to reject him.When Flake stood up and introduced himself, Trump told him, ""You've been very critical of me,"" the Post said.
""Yes, I'm the other senator from Arizona -- the one who didn't get captured -- and I want to talk to you about statements like that,"" Flake responded, referring to Trump's past dismissal of Senator John McCain's record as a prisoner during the Vietnam war.The senator urged Trump to stop attacking Mexicans; Trump predicted that Flake would lose his re-election, at which point Flake informed Trump that Flake was not up for re-election this year.Flake's spokesman Jason Samuels said the Post account was accurate.Trump also turned to Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who has refused to endorse him, and ""said something along the lines of 'Surely you don't want Clinton,'"" one Republican aide said of the session.Trump said he would win also in Illinois, the home state of a third Republican critic, Senator Mark Kirk, who is in a tight re-election race and recently withdrew his endorsement of Trump.""He's wrong,"" Kirk told reporters several hours later.""I think Trump is going to get a vote like Alan Keyes got, which is about 28 percent,"" Kirk said, referring to the Republican who ran unsuccessfully for senator against Obama in Illinois in 2004.  Trump's Twitter posting as he left Washington showed no sign of discord. ""Very interesting day! These are people who love our country!"" he tweeted.

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The White House and congressional Democrats pressured Republicans on Thursday for bipartisan Zika-funding legislation, saying the public health battle against the mosquito-borne virus is being undercut by efforts to ram through a bill with less funding.But there was no sign that Republicans would abandon their $1.1 billion measure, raising the chance that Congress will leave the growing health crisis unattended until September. In a conference call, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the lack of funding has made it difficult for the health agency to ramp up mosquito-control and diagnostic testing and pursue new research.President Barack Obama asked the Republican-controlled Congress in February for $1.9 billion in emergency funding to fight Zika. But as lawmakers prepare to leave for a seven-week recess on July 15, Senate Democrats who defeated the Republican measure last week predict it will only fail again.""We are at the 11th hour and 59th minute before Congress is gone all summer,"" said Democratic Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, which is among a number of southern U.S. states likely to be hard-hit by the Zika virus.U.S. health officials say Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. Over the past few days, Obama has urged Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democrats to adopt a bipartisan approach. On Thursday, Democrats called on McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan to revive a bipartisan measure that passed the Senate in May.
McConnell has said he would stick with the current legislation, which was agreed by House and Senate negotiators and has already passed the House. A senior Senate Republican aide dismissed the call for change as ""cover"" for Democratic efforts to block the Republican measure. A Ryan spokeswoman said: ""We hope Senate Democrats do the right thing and end their filibuster.""Even some Democratic aides expressed skepticism that McConnell or Ryan would change course.       The CDC is monitoring 320 pregnant U.S. women with laboratory evidence of Zika infection. In Puerto Rico, where Zika has been rampant for months, as many as 50 pregnant women are infected every day, CDC Director Thomas Frieden said.
Altogether, there are more than 1,130 Zika cases in the United States, the CDC said. All contracted the virus outside the United States, in a lab or through unprotected sex. Frieden said the CDC has spent most of the $222 million it has received for Zika in the United States on state and municipal efforts, funding, staffing and equipment.""It's frankly difficult to navigate with so many unknowns,"" Frieden said. ""That's why we haven't been able to do things like begin ramping up centers of excellence to improve the performance of diagnostic tests, of mosquito control and to begin some of the really in-depth studies.""
Additional funding would also aid vaccine research and help community health centers in areas with the highest Zika transmission rates. The Republican measure failed in the Senate on June 28 when Democrats objected to Republican provisions, including one to prevent Planned Parenthood from receiving funds to combat what can be sexually transmitted infection.The legislation would also take money from battling the Ebola virus and from funds set aside to implement the Obamacare health insurance program in U.S. territories.""They'll force yet another failed vote on this cynical legislation and then pack their bags for the longest Senate vacation since 1954,"" Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said.The World Health Organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults. The connection between Zika and microcephaly first came to light last fall in Brazil, which has now confirmed more than 1,600 cases of microcephaly that it considers to be related to Zika infections in the mothers.
