By Sharon Bernstein and Rory Carroll

Authorities in Philadelphia will station prosecutors throughout the city on election day to respond to any reports of voter intimidation or other illegal activity after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump claimed that polling might be ""rigged"" in this mostly minority city.Philadelphia is one of many U.S. municipalities wrestling with how to respond to Trump's call for supporters to ""watch"" polling places, and corresponding promises from civil rights groups that they will send their own backers to the polls.""All of our election judges will be provided with cell phones that have direct access to the district attorney's office of Philadelphia,"" said Tim Dowling, chief deputy to City Commissioner Lisa Deeley. ""As soon as you cross the line, you're going to be dealing with law enforcement.""The Nov. 8 presidential election has been among the most contentious in the nation's history. Trump, whose campaign has been shaken by allegations that he groped numerous women after a video surfaced in which he made lewd comments about groping women, has refused to promise that he will accept the results of the election if he loses to Democrat Hillary Clinton.This week, Trump told supporters to ""watch"" polling places in such cities as Philadelphia, St. Louis and Chicago - all with large minority populations. As Trump has slipped in the polls, he has repeatedly said the election is ""rigged"" against him.Fearing that to be true, voters in Denver have been calling officials seeking reassurance, said Amber McReynolds, the city's director of elections. ""Voters will call in and say, 'Is the election rigged?' McReynolds said. ""We try to explain how the process works. ... Rigging an election is pretty much impossible.""
Various election experts, including Republicans, have said that it is virtually impossible to rig a presidential election, and numerous studies have shown that voter fraud in U.S. elections is very rare.In Arizona, a traditionally Republican state where polls have recently begun to show an increase in support for Clinton, poll workers are being trained to deal with an expected onslaught of observers, said Elizabeth Bartholomew, spokeswoman for elections officials in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located.In North Carolina, where a local Republican party headquarters was badly damaged on Sunday in an unsolved arson attack, state elections officials are taking extra steps to address poll security.On Wednesday, the state elections board's executive director, Kim Strach, sent county elections officials a memo outlining examples of prohibited behavior at polling places and emphasizing that state and federals laws bar intimidation and coercion at the polls.
In Philadelphia, teams from the district attorney's office will be stationed throughout the city, ready to respond at a moment's notice, Dowling said. The city is also increasing security at polling places, demanding for the first time identification even from credentialed poll-watchers sent by political parties.The city has activated such teams in previous elections, but this year there are more, and they will be set up at police stations.""Because of all the rhetoric, we're erring on the side of caution,"" Dowling said.Despite the high-profile nature of the claims, fears about intimidation at polling places may be overblown. Some of Trump's supporters have distanced themselves from his remarks about watching the polls.
Many jurisdictions allow poll watchers, but they generally have to be credentialed and their numbers are limited. Several elections officials said they had so far not received an unusually high number of requests for poll-watcher credentials.In Leon County, Florida, for example, where the state capital of Tallahassee is located, 55 people affiliated with the Democratic Party had registered as poll watchers to observe early voting, which begins Monday. Two had signed up on behalf of Trump, and none for the Republican Party, Ion Sancho, supervisor of elections for the county.""We don't believe there will be any problems at the polls,"" he said.Florida civil rights activist Becca Guerra said she is not worried about voter intimidation inside polling places because of rules on electioneering and on poll watchers, but voters may have trouble outside in the parking lot.""We are training our folks to be the eyes and ears,"" she said.

By Lizbeth Diaz
| MEXICO CITY

MEXICO CITY Supporters of U.S. Republican candidate Donald Trump unwittingly helped pick up the tab for a booze-up in Mexico City on Thursday, after they were duped into buying cleverly concealed anti-Trump t-shirts designed by a local brewery.Trump, who has labeled Mexicans rapists and drug runners, has caused outrage south of the border with his vow to build a border wall that Mexico will pay for - a pledge that inspired brewer Cerveza Cucapa's ingenious scheme to get Trump supporters to cough up for Mexicans' brews.""It's amazing that we can have a party paid for by Donald Trump!"" said 54-year-old Leticia Villanueva, cradling her free beer at the event which had attracted a few hundred people.  Late last month, Cucapa, an artisanal brewery from the northern border state of Baja California, posted a video in which representatives went to the United States to hawk blue t-shirts with Trump's face that ostensibly say ""I support Donald.""
However, unbeknown to the buyer, when they put on the t-shirt, their body temperature adds a clown's nose to Trump's face and alters the message to read ""Donald: El que lo Lea,"" a traditional message meaning ""Whoever reads this is Donald.""Proceeds from the tongue-in-cheek publicity stunt helped fund the event on Thursday in Mexico City, where a well-heeled crowd of young boozers in bright yellow Trump wigs took cheer from the property mogul's recent collapse in the polls. ""His campaign is garbage, and the only good thing he's ever done is get us drunk,"" said 21-year-old Ivan Grajeda. ""It's great that he's losing ... that's a triumph for Mexico.""
Others hoped that their family in the United States would turn out and vote in the Nov. 8 election for Hillary Clinton, who has strengthened her lead against Trump in recent weeks after her Republican rival faced a string of groping allegations.""I ask my family members over there to vote for Hillary, as it's not in their interests for Trump to win,"" said Jose Ramon Trevino, 28. "" I have family in Chicago and they are hard-working people, who don't go looking for problems or beg for money in the street.""
Esteban Pacheco, a 26-year-old Cucapa employee, said the aim of the brewer's campaign was to build bridges between the two countries. ""We want to unite the people with these types of activities,"" he said. (Writing by Gabriel Stargardter; Editing by Michael Perry)"	['Trump']	[]

By Ginger Gibson and Grant Smith
| WASHINGTON/NEW YORK

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Republican Donald Trump could go down as the least well-funded presidential candidate in recent campaigns - entering the final month of the election still without the cash to match the level of staff and advertising that has helped power the campaign of his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.With less than three weeks until the election, it is too late for Trump to amass the amount of cash he would need to unleash a spending assault that might turn his hobbled campaign around. Through the end of September, Trump raised a total of $163 million - a far cry from Clinton's $449 million.Trump, a New York real estate developer who has boasted about his wealth, pledged to use millions of his personal assets to fund his campaign. In addition to the $163 million raised, he put in $47.5 million during the primary and then added another $8.6 million.Trump's fundraising deficit has resulted from a series of campaign crises that made wealthy donors reluctant to contribute to his campaign and reflects that he does not enjoy working the fundraising circuit or calling large-dollar donors to ask them to write checks.That's a big disadvantage for Trump. And it shows in how he has been outspent trying to win the Nov. 8 election for the White House, particularly in the two largest spending categories: staff and television commercials.When it comes to staff, Trump has spent $5 million, compared with Clinton's spending of about $38 million. Trump had 168 people on his payroll in September, more than doubling the 82 he had on staff in July. Additionally, Trump spent $5 million on field consultants, part-time workers who are not part of the main staff.
Clinton had 815 people on her staff in September. On advertising, Trump has spent $48.7 million while Clinton has spent $204 million - allowing her to blanket the airwaves with a deluge of advertisements.It has also allowed Clinton to inject more money into states that have become closer as Election Day nears. Earlier this week, Clinton's campaign announced it was spending an additional $2 million in Arizona, a late-game decision to try to win a traditionally Republican state that now appears within her grasp.Overall, Trump has spent about $190 million by the end of September, compared with Clinton's $401 million. 
Trump and Clinton can collect donations up to $5,400 from a single individual, but can also collect larger checks that are then divided between the campaign and joint fundraisers with the national and state parties. The funds that candidates raise for the national and state political parties are still used for the common effort of hiring staff and getting voters to turn out to the polls. But those funds cannot be used in the most direct parts of running a campaign, like buying television ads or hiring staff that report to the campaign manager.Trump's campaign struggled to get organized and build out the infrastructure that is needed to be competitive in the key battleground states. Instead, Trump has been dependent on the infrastructure built by the Republican Party.Trump has raised $244 million through joint fundraising committees with the national parties, of which he got $71 million. 
By comparison, Clinton has raised $415 million through joint fundraisers, of which $117 million went to her campaign.Since 2008, major party presidential candidates have stopped accepting public funding for their general election campaigns - which placed limits on the amount a candidate could raise and spend.But even the last candidate to accept public funds, Senator John McCain in 2008, raised more that year than Trump did this election. McCain raised more than $300 million. That same year, Barack Obama, in his first presidential race, raised $607 million.In 2012, Mitt Romney raised more than $337 million at this point in the campaign. And Obama had raised $564 million.

By David Rohde and Mark Hosenball

U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to Russia's intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud.The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election.But hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said.They said that they did not have specific evidence of such a plan, but state and local election authorities had been warned to be vigilant for hacking attempts.On Oct. 7, the U.S. government formally accused Russia for the first time of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations to interfere with the election process.
U.S. officials familiar with hacking directed against American voting systems said evidence indicates that suspected Russian government-backed hackers have so far tried to attack voter registration databases operated by more than 20 states. Tracing the attacks can be difficult but breaches of only two such databases have been confirmed, they said.The officials said there is no evidence that any hackers have succeeded in accessing equipment or databases used to record votes. Many states use systems that would be difficult to hack or defraud, including paper ballots which initially are tallied by machines.U.S. elections are run by state and local officials, not the federal government. On Nov. 8, votes will be cast in hundreds of thousands of polling stations in 9,000 different jurisdictions, according to the National Association of Secretaries of State.
The U.S. officials declined to comment on Republican candidate Donald Trump's contention that the election is being ""rigged."" Trump said in the third and final presidential debate with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton on Wednesday night that he would not say until the election results were known whether or not he would accept the outcome.Trump and his campaign officials have repeatedly said that the potential for voter fraud remains high but they have not provided any evidence.
On Thursday, Trump said he would accept the results of the election ""if I win."" He said he reserved the ""right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result.""  Clinton supporters said Trump is unwittingly aiding an effort by Russian President Vladimir Putin to undercut the credibility of the vote. Washington and Moscow are at odds over several issues, from Russian involvement in the Ukraine conflict, the war in Syria and cyber attacks. ""Trump does not even know he is being manipulated,"" said Michael Morell, a former deputy CIA director who has endorsed Clinton. ""Trump is an unwitting agent of Putin.""

By David Schwartz
| PHOENIX

PHOENIX Embattled Arizona lawman Joe Arpaio, whose get-tough policies to fight illegal immigration and praise of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump brought him nationwide attention, trails his opponent in this year's election by nearly 15 percentage points, according to a Thursday poll.The poll, conducted by The Arizona Republic/Morrison/Cronkite News, shows Democratic challenger Paul Penzone has the support of nearly 45.9 percent of those surveyed as he attempts to unseat the six-term Maricopa County sheriff. Arpaio garnered 31.1 percent.Roughly one-fifth of those surveyed said they were still undecided on the Nov. 8 race for the top law enforcement job in the state's most populous county. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 5.6 percent.The poll was taken as federal prosecutors announced that the U.S. Justice Department would seek a criminal contempt charge against Arpaio for violating a court order in a 2007 racial profiling case.The charges center on unlawful traffic stops and detentions by deputies of Latino drivers for 18 months after the judge ordered them to cease.
Arpaio, who has denied any intentional wrongdoing, has already been cited for civil contempt stemming from his actions in the case.Political observers have said prospects of a criminal prosecution for the 84-year-old hardline sheriff seem to have raised the ante in recent days in what already promised to be Arpaio's sternest election test.Arpaio campaign manager Chad Willems disputed the poll results, saying that the campaign's own survey has the sheriff leading Penzone by 7.5 points.
""The recent 'poll' by the Arizona Republic is a complete joke,"" said Willems in a statement to Reuters, adding that Democrats were disproportionately included in the survey's sample size.""The numbers in NO way accurately depict the electorate of Maricopa County, Arizona,"" he said. ""Why they chose to conduct their survey this way is beyond any comprehension.""
A Penzone campaign official could not immediately be reached for comment.Arpaio has continued to play on a national stage during his tenure as sheriff despite his legal battles. His calls for a crackdown on undocumented immigrants, opening a tent city to house inmates and making them wear pink underwear all have proved popular.He also has appeared for Trump, praising the Republican nominee's border policies, including building a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border.

5	5	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-turnout-analysis-idUSKCN12K0II	Rigged elections? Nasty woman? Trump's scorched earth tactics have little upside	"


By James Oliphant and Chris Kahn

Republican Donald Trump had one last chance at a nationally televised debate to reach out to the undecided voters he badly needs to keep his presidential campaign viable. He passed on the opportunity. Instead, he chose on Wednesday to stay with the strategy he has employed during recent weeks: Pump up his hard-core supporters and hope that's enough to win. He suggested he might not accept the election result if his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton wins on Nov. 8, called her a ""nasty woman,"" and repeated hard-line conservative positions on issues such as abortion and immigration. While that kind of rhetoric was catnip to his passionate, anti-establishment base, it is unlikely to have appealed to independent voters and women who have yet to choose a candidate.""When you're trailing in the polls, you don't need a headline the next morning saying that you're not going to accept the election results,"" said Ford O'Connell, a Republican strategist who supports Trump.With less than three weeks left in the race, Trump is behind Clinton in most battleground states and is underperforming in almost every demographic voter group compared to the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, four years ago. Party strategists had said before the debate that he needed to use the event to draw in voters beyond his hard-core supporters. Trump didn't listen or perhaps didn't care.STRATEGY MAY BACKFIRE

His debate was a continuation of his apparent strategy to ensure his most fervent supporters show up on Election Day, while betting that his attacks on Clinton's character and truthfulness will discourage voting by already skeptical young and liberal Democrats.But experts who study voter behavior warned that his attacks on Clinton may backfire, saying he may instead awaken Democratic voters who have so far been uninspired by Clinton.""The risk he faces by engaging in a scorched-earth policy is that he activates people rather than turning them off,"" said Michael McDonald, who runs the U.S. Election Project at the University of Florida.McDonald, who tracks early voting returns and absentee ballot requests, said he is seeing larger than expected surges of support for Clinton in southeastern states such as Virginia, North Carolina, and Florida.
The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project, which uses a massive online opinion poll to project election outcomes in all 50 states, estimates that Clinton has a 95 percent chance of winning the election by about 118 votes in the Electoral College if it were held today.It is against this backdrop that Trump has apparently decided to double down on energizing his base rather than broadening it. But the poll results cast doubt on the wisdom of that strategy.If Trump's core white, male, working class supporters vote at high rates, as expected, that likely won't be enough to win. Trump, for example, already does well with white men who are at retirement age. Nine out of 10 of them are already expected to vote, according to the polling results, so, there is little room to squeeze out more votes.RIGGED ELECTION

Voting rights activists have accused Trump of trying to suppress voter turnout by claiming, without evidence, that the election has been rigged against him. He has also said his supporters need to monitor polling stations to ensure a fair vote, which the activists decry as an act of intimidation. Should Trump's comments succeed in discouraging some Democratic voters from turning out, that may also not be enough to help him secure the White House. He still loses under what could be considered a dream scenario for the Republican nominee: white men show up in greater numbers than expected, while turnout among racial minorities is lower than expected.In this scenario, the States of the Nation project estimates that Trump would win the battleground states of Ohio and North Carolina, and he would have a shot at winning Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Colorado. Even then, Clinton would still have an 82 percent chance of winning the election.There's yet another risk to Trump's strategy. By claiming the election is rigged, he could be unintentionally signaling to his supporters that voting no longer matters.Michael Sopko, 63, a mortgage broker from Denver and a Trump backer, said before the debate that he sees his vote as pointless.""They have already been corrupted,"" he said of voting machines, speaking ahead of a Trump rally in Colorado Springs. ""I think the results are already cast."" (Reporting by James Oliphant, Chris Kahn, and Emily Stephenson, editing by Paul Thomasch and Ross Colvin)"	['Paul', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Ross']	['abortion']

By Laila Kearney
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK T-shirts inspired by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's ""such a nasty woman"" comment on Democrat Hillary Clinton in Wednesday night's debate were flying off internet retailers' shelves, offering a possible hint on the Nov. 8 election result. Sellers said on Thursday that demand came swiftly and was unrivaled minutes after the final debate ended.""I have had nonstop orders since last night,"" Pennsylvania part-time graphic designer Naheed Snyder said of her T-shirt, designed simply with the words ""Nasty women vote,"" selling on Etsy. ""It's unbelievable how well this one has done... there's no comparison."" Merchandise retailers typically see a profit boost during election season as voters on both sides seek to wear support for their candidates, particularly around conventions, voting and this year, debates. Traffic to Teespring.com, a website that allows users to create, sell and buy personalized T-shirts, spiked 40 percent during the second presidential debate and 120 percent in the third debate, the company said. Merchandise promoting the Republican candidate was steadily higher earlier in the race, said Maheesh Jain, co-founder of online customizable merchandise retailer CafePress. Some of the most popular items included the slogans ""I am a deplorable"" and ""Hillary for prison."" 
At a fundraiser in September, Clinton said Trump had given voice to hateful rhetoric through his behavior as a candidate, and that ""you can put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the 'basket of deplorables.'"" The following day she said she regretted saying ""half"" and that she had been ""grossly generalistic."" In the last two weeks, after the release of Trump's 2005 lewd remarks toward women and an onslaught of women accusing him of sexual harassment or assault, the items have declined in popularity, Jain said. Trump has apologized for the remarks and denied the accusations.""Right now, we're definitely seeing a lot more Hillary merchandise selling than Trump merchandise,"" said Jain.Sales of pro-Clinton merchandise last week were 53.5 percent higher than for Trump, Jain said.
After the third and final presidential debate on Wednesday, Trump's ""nasty woman"" comment gave life to a new merchandise line aimed at assailing him.""If Hillary Clinton is a nasty woman for being most likely our next president, maybe that's not such a bad thing,"" said Amanda Brinkman, who runs the online feminist-centered accessory shop Google Ghost. ""Maybe that's something you should wear as a badge of honor.""Brinkman's ""Nasty Woman"" T-shirt, featuring the phrase with a heart around it, sold more than 6,000 times since she designed and posted it during Wednesday's debate. The second most-popular item in her store's history, a pen, at its peak garnered 25 sales in a single day.
Brinkman, from New Orleans, said she is donating half of the proceeds to reproductive healthcare provider Planned Parenthood, which Trump opposes because it offers abortions.""I thought it only made sense to use his own words to sell a product that would then benefit Planned Parenthood,"" Brinkman said.In past elections, Jain said, her company had seen a direct link between the most merchandise sold and the candidate that won the election.""Typically, whoever is winning in the sales column will win the election,"" Jain said. ""Right now, we're seeing Clinton winning the election."" (Reporting by Laila Kearney; Editing by Dan Grebler)"	['Snyder', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	['healthcare']

By Jill Serjeant

An estimated 71.6 million people watched the final debate between White House contenders Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on TV on Wednesday, below the audience for their first encounter but the third-largest total ever recorded.  The data supplied by the Nielsen ratings agency on Thursday covered people who watched Wednesday night's debate on the four main U.S. broadcast networks plus nine cable and public television channels.The first Clinton-Trump face-off in September attracted a total TV audience of 84 million, the largest in the history of U.S. presidential debates.Last week's second debate, which was broadcast opposite popular ""Sunday Night Football,"" was seen by 66.5 million.
Wednesday's audience ranked as the third-highest for a U.S.  presidential debate since Nielsen started collecting TV viewership figures for the encounters in 1976. A 1980 debate between Democratic President Jimmy Carter and Republican challenger Ronald Reagan drew 80.6 million viewers.Nielsen data reflects only those who watched the debate on TV at home and did not include millions more who watched online, through social media or in bars and restaurants.
The third debate ahead of the Nov. 8 election was marked by Trump's refusal to commit to accepting the outcome of the election if the Republican candidate loses to his Democratic rival, challenging a cornerstone of American democracy.The presidential election debate, held in Las Vegas, was moderated for the first time by a journalist from Fox News, Chris Wallace. It gave Fox News cable channel  the lead in number of viewers for the debate at 11.2 million, followed by broadcasters ABC and NBC with more than 10 million viewers each.
Second and third presidential debates have generally attracted smaller TV audiences because many voters have already made up their minds after a presidential campaign lasting more than a year.

By Roberta Rampton
| MIAMI

MIAMI President Barack Obama said on Thursday that his departure from office in January might be what it takes to begin to heal the political scars over Obamacare and allow for needed fixes to his signature healthcare law.The 2010 Affordable Care Act tipped off a long and bitter political and legal battle between the White House and Republicans in the U.S. Congress who said the 2010 law creates unwarranted government intervention in personal healthcare and private industry.Republicans have been quick to highlight a recent barrage of negative headlines about rising health insurance premiums and shrinking doctor networks for people participating in subsidized insurance plans offered under the law.Obama acknowledged the law is not working perfectly, but said the problems could be fixed by legislation, encouraging lawmakers to create a government-run health insurance option to help U.S. states where there is little or no competition among private insurers.""Maybe now that I'm leaving office, maybe Republicans can stop with the 60-something repeal votes they've taken and stop pretending that they have a serious alternative ... and just work with the next president to smooth out the kinks,"" he said in a speech at Miami Dade College.""They can even change the name of the law to Reagancare, or Paul Ryan care,"" Obama said, evoking the name of the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives. ""I don't care. I just want it to work.""But Ryan, in a written response, said he would continue to seek to repeal and replace the law. ""At this point, one thing is clear: this law can't be fixed,"" Ryan said.Obama was later slated to headline a rally in Florida, a battleground election state, for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election. Clinton has said she would add a public option and expand tax incentives for healthcare costs. Republican nominee Donald Trump has pledged to repeal and replace the law.
The government forecasts 13.8 million people will sign up for Obamacare plans in 2017, up 1.1 million from 2016.There are 10.7 million uninsured people who are eligible for the exchanges but have not enrolled, and about 40 percent of those are young, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said on Wednesday.Obama said that nationwide, not enough young and healthy people have signed up to provide a revenue stream that offsets the costs of covering members with serious illnesses.As a result, several big insurers, including UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N), Aetna Inc (AET.N) and Humana Inc (HUM.N), are pulling out of the online marketplaces selling the subsidized plans, citing bigger-than-expected financial losses.
Monthly premium prices have climbed, which further discourages some people from signing up.""Next year will tell whether those are growing pains, or they are more serious issues,"" Drew Altman, chief executive of the Kaiser Family Foundation, said in an interview.Analysis conducted by the nonpartisan foundation suggests at least 16 million people need to enroll before the online Obamacare insurance marketplaces stabilize.Obama said expanding insurance coverage for millions of people and reforming the healthcare system was a key reason he ran for office. He said he gets letters from Americans every day thanking him for the difference it has made in their lives.
The law cut the number of uninsured Americans from 49 million in 2010 to 29 million in 2015.Much of the decline is due to the law's provision allowing states to expand Medicaid health coverage for the poor.The law also prohibited insurance companies from denying coverage to Americans for existing medical problems, and allowed parents to keep children insured on their health plans until age 26.Some health policy experts on both the political left and right say Congress may be more receptive to bipartisan efforts to fix the Affordable Care Act after Obama leaves office. Some Republican governors who refused to expand Medicaid may also be more willing to do so after the election - a change that would expand coverage for about 4 million people.""I think the piece of Obamacare that people don't like is Obama,"" Kathleen Sebelius, Obama's former Health and Human Services secretary, who oversaw the program's launch, said in an interview. ""This has become a very personal battle about this president, which is I think really unfortunate.""

9	9	http://reuters.com/article/us-virginia-election-idUSKCN12K289	U.S. judge orders Virginia to extend voter registration through Friday	"


By Scott Malone

A federal judge on Thursday ordered Virginia to reopen its voter registration window and allow residents to continue to sign up through midnight Friday, after its online registration portal was unavailable to many users earlier this week.U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton's order came in response to a lawsuit filed on Tuesday by the activist New Virginia Education Fund, which complained that the state's online voter registration portal had worked erratically in the days leading up to the state's initial Monday deadline to register.The lawsuit argued that the problems risked illegally denying thousands of people the right to vote in the Nov. 8 election.Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe this year restored the right to vote to thousands of ex-felons, a move seen as potentially tipping what had been a traditional Republican stronghold in Democrats' favor.
""I am pleased that the court has agreed with the request to extend Virginia's voter registration period after unprecedented web traffic prevented many people from completing their registrations online before the original deadline,"" McAuliffe, a Democrat, said in a statement on Thursday. ""The Commonwealth will fully comply with the court's order and extend our registration process online, in person and through the mail.""
State law gives the power to extend voting registration to the legislature, so McAuliffe had been unable to act until the judge's ruling, noted Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond School of Law. The Republican-controlled legislature had declined to take any action following the flurry of complaints on Monday.""The real question is if this leaves enough time to get the word out to people who had been blocked from registering and may not know that the issue has been resolved,"" Tobias added.
Shortly after the judge's decision was handed down in an Alexandria courtroom, the state's Department of Elections updated its Web site to show the new deadline.Representatives of the New Virginia fund did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Recent polls show Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton leading Republican New York real estate developer Donald Trump in the state.The decision comes the week after a judge in North Carolina gave residents in counties hard hit by Hurricane Matthew additional time to register to vote. Similar steps were also taken in parts of Georgia, South Carolina and Florida following the storm."	['Richmond', 'McAuliffe', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]
