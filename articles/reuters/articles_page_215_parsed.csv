By Timothy Gardner
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama commuted the prison terms of 42 non-violent drug offenders, nearly half of whom were serving life sentences, in his latest batch of clemency decisions, the White House said on Friday.The individuals ""have more than repaid their debt to society and earned this second chance,"" Neil Eggleston, the White House counsel, wrote in a blog. They were convicted under drug sentencing laws put on the books before Obama became president that were ""outdated and unduly harsh,"" Eggleston wrote. Obama has worked to reform the U.S. criminal justice system to reduce the number of people serving long sentences for drug crimes. It is one of the few areas in which the Democratic president has received support from Republican lawmakers. Many of the convicts had been serving time for crack cocaine charges. Crack offenders have for years faced stiffer penalties than offenders of powder cocaine, even though the two substances are molecularly similar. Critics have said the disparity has unfairly hurt minority communities. 
Obama announced the most ambitious clemency program in 40 years in April, 2014. The program has struggled under a deluge of thousands of unprocessed cases. Some legal experts, including Rachel Barkow, faculty director at the Center on the Administration of Criminal Law at New York University, have urged Obama to move faster on the program, saying unless he does, the program will remain a ""lottery"" for thousands of other convicts.
Friday's commutations bring the total to 348, more than granted by the previous seven presidents combined, the White House said. George W. Bush commuted the sentences of 11 individuals, Bill Clinton granted clemency to 61 and George H.W. Bush granted clemency to three people, the White House said. ""We are confident that there will be many more commutations in the months"" before Obama leaves office in January next year,  Sally Yates, the deputy attorney general, said in a release.
The White House also said Obama is committed to strengthening drug rehabilitation programs. (Reporting by Timothy Gardner Editing by G Crosse and James Dalgleish)"	['Clinton', 'Gardner', 'Obama']	[]

By Yeganeh Torbati and Arshad Mohammed
| PARIS/WASHINGTON

PARIS/WASHINGTON It was stupid, clumsy and inappropriate for someone to edit the video of a State Department briefing in 2013, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Friday as two U.S. lawmakers demanded information about the incident. A Republican congressman asked the State Department inspector general to investigate why part of a public briefing that dealt with Iran nuclear talks was cut before it was posted online while another demanded documents about the incident.The excised portion of the Dec. 2, 2013, briefing included a question about whether an earlier spokeswoman for the department had misled reporters about whether the United States was holding secret direct nuclear talks with Iran.The spokeswoman had denied there were such talks, which were later made public. The State Department this week said she did not know about the secret talks when she denied their existence.Speaking to reporters in Paris, Kerry sounded chagrined about the episode, which has drawn Republican criticism.
""Whatever happened was both clumsy and stupid and inappropriate,"" Kerry said. Asked if he wanted people who tampered with the historical record working for him, he replied: ""Of course not. I just said, it's inappropriate.""The State Department initially said it believed a ""glitch"" caused the gap but on Wednesday said an internal inquiry found it was a deliberate omission. However, it said no rules were broken because none existed governing the integrity of the briefing video. Rules are now being put in place.
U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the technician who excised part of the video told investigators she got a call asking her to do so, discussed the request with her supervisor and concluded it came from a ""level of credibility and authority"" high enough that they should act on the request.The State Department has said the technician does not remember who called her. On Friday the department said it cannot use internal phone records to trace who requested the cut to the briefing video because it keeps such data for only 24 hours.Top officials in the Bureau of Public Affairs in late 2013, including former Assistant Secretary Doug Frantz, former spokeswoman Jen Psaki, former deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf, and deputy assistant secretaries Dana Smith, Valerie Fowler and Moira Whelan have all denied asking for the video to be excised.
""In tampering with this video, the Bureau of Public Affairs has undermined its mission to 'communicate timely and accurate information with the goal of furthering U.S. foreign policy',"" House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce said in a letter released by his office that asked the department's inspector general, Steve Linick, to investigate the matter.Separately, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, also a Republican, on Tuesday wrote to Secretary of State John Kerry asking for documents related to the edited video to be turned over to his panel by Wednesday.

By Dustin Volz and Jason Lange
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A U.S. congressional committee has launched an investigation into the Federal Reserve's cyber security practices after a Reuters report revealed more than 50 cyber breaches at the U.S. central bank between 2011 and 2015.The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology on Friday sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to express ""serious concerns"" over the central bank's ability to protect sensitive financial information.The letter cited the Reuters report, which was based on heavily redacted internal Fed records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. The redacted records did not say who hacked the bank's systems or whether they accessed sensitive information or stole money.""These reports raise serious concerns about the Federal Reserve's cyber security posture, including its ability to prevent threats from compromising highly sensitive financial information housed on the agency's systems,"" said the letter, signed by House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, and Barry Loudermilk, a Georgia Republican and chairman of the panel's oversight subcommittee.A Fed spokesperson said the central bank had received the panel's letter and ""will respond to it.""
The panel asked the Fed's national cyber security team - the National Incident Response Team - to turn over all cyber incident reports in unredacted form from Jan. 1, 2009, to the present. It also asked for incident reports from the Fed's local incident response teams.Global policymakers, regulators and financial institutions have become increasingly concerned about the security of the international banking system after a string of cyber attacks against banks in Bangladesh, Vietnam and elsewhere linked to fraudulent transaction messages sent across the global financial platform SWIFT.The probe into the Fed's security practices followed a separate inquiry by the same committee into the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's handling of the cyber theft of $81 million from one of its accounts held by the central bank of Bangladesh.
The committee said it has jurisdiction over the Fed's cyber security because the panel is tasked with oversight of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, an agency responsible for developing federal cyber security standards and guidelines, under a 2014 federal information technology law.The panel also requested a ""detailed description of all confirmed cyber security incidents"" from 2009 to the present, all documents and communications referring or relating to ""higher impact cases"" handled by the Fed's NIRT team, all documents and communications with the Fed's Office of Inspector General related to confirmed cyber incidents, and an organizational chart detailing the Fed's top cyber security personnel.The committee requested a response to its inquiry by June 17. (Click here to read the letter: tmsnrt.rs/1VBXvSz)
The Fed's computer systems hold confidential information on discussions about monetary policy that drives financial markets. The central bank's staff suspected hackers or spies were behind many of the breaches, the records obtained by Reuters show. The Fed had declined to comment on the records, which represent only a slice of all cyber attacks on the central bank because they include only cases involving the Washington-based Board of Governors, a federal agency that is subject to public records laws.(For a graphic on the Fed security breaches, see: tmsnrt.rs/1TxSu8R) (Reporting by Dustin Volz and Jason Lange; Editing by David Chance and Tiffany Wu)"	[]	[]

By Amanda Becker
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton lambasted  Donald Trump's foreign policy platform as ""dangerously incoherent"" in a speech on Thursday that cast her Republican rival as both a frightening and laughable figure.In remarks that at times resembled a comedy roast, Clinton unleashed a torrent of polished zingers and one-liners to attack Trump's policies and character, suggesting Trump might start a nuclear war if elected to the White House simply because ""somebody got under his very thin skin."" ""Donald Trump's ideas are not just different, they are dangerously incoherent,"" she said to a room of supporters in San Diego, California. ""They're not even really ideas, just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and outright lies.""Clinton, the front-runner in the race to become the Democratic presidential nominee, delivered her speech as she seeks to shift her attention to the Nov. 8 election against likely rival Trump and away from Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, who is continuing his long-shot bid for the nomination.Clinton was speaking in San Diego ahead of California's June 7 primary election.Democratic Party leaders have fretted about how to best oppose Trump, who managed to knock out all 16 rivals for the Republican nomination in part with his uninhibited style of assailing them with personal insults. Trump revels in referring to Clinton as ""Crooked Hillary"" and dredging up the infidelities of her husband, Bill Clinton, the former president.Clinton's remarks were intended in part to show she would not be cowed and that she could go toe-to-toe with him in scornful put-downs.""He says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia,"" she said as the crowd guffawed, and she suggested Trump would run the U.S. economy ""like one of his casinos.""During her speech, Clinton predicted Trump, who has been deeply critical of Clinton's foreign policy record, would take to his Twitter account to insult her, and he did.""Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton!"" ran one posting during the speech, which included a typo. ""Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn't even look presidential!""
Trump has said previously that Clinton is distorting his actual policies.TWO VISIONS
Amid the laugh lines, Clinton cited her own experience as secretary of state, in particular her role advising President Barack Obama during the mission to kill al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, to suggest her approach to foreign policy was the more serious.
""He praises dictators like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our friends, including the British prime minister, the mayor of London, the German chancellor, the president of Mexico and the pope,"" Clinton said, listing some of the allies with whom Trump has verbally sparred in the last year.Obama, who has also been repeatedly mocked by Trump, has criticized Trump as being ignorant or cavalier about world affairs and has said that Trump's rise has ""rattled"" foreign leaders.Trump has talked tough on foreign policy. He has said he would bring back waterboarding and other brutal interrogation techniques for terrorism suspects that are widely regarded as torture and were discontinued by Obama.Trump has also vowed to renegotiate trade deals, called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, and said he would ask members of the 28-nation NATO alliance to ""pay up"" or ""get out."" He has said he would sit down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program.Clinton derided these and other positions, promising she would do a better job keeping the United States safe. Standing in front of a backdrop of 19 large U.S. flags, an unusual abundance even by the standards of presidential campaign events, Clinton painted the election as a choice between ""two very different visions.""
""One that's angry, afraid and based on the idea that America is fundamentally weak and in decline,"" she said, summing up Trumpism. ""The other is hopeful, generous and confident in the knowledge that America is great, just like we always have been.""Trump has criticized Clinton for her handling of foreign policy during her 2009-2013 stint as secretary of state, including the Sept. 11, 2012, attack by Islamist militants on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.He cites Clinton's support for the war in Iraq, launched by former Republican President George W. Bush, as another example of her shortcomings.Democratic challenger Sanders echoed Clinton's concerns about Trump after her speech, though he also criticized Clinton's foreign policy. ""I agree ... that Donald Trump's foreign policy ideas are incredibly reckless and irresponsible,"" Sanders said in a statement.In criticizing Clinton, Sanders cited her vote for the war in Iraq, calling it ""the worst foreign policy blunder in modern American history,"" and said ""she has been a proponent of regime change, as in Libya, without thinking through the consequences.""In assailing each other's suitability for the White House, Clinton and Trump are reflecting a negative voter mood ahead of next month's party conventions that will choose the presidential nominees.Both Clinton and Trump are facing record-low favorability ratings. A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken Friday through Tuesday shows half of Trump supporters say the primary reason they are going to vote for him is ""I don't want Hillary Clinton to win,"" while 41 percent of Clinton supporters cite their primary reason as not wanting Trump to win.

By Marius Zaharia
| SINGAPORE

SINGAPORE NATO's top military officer, General Petr Pavel, denounced U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump on Friday for criticizing the alliance as obsolete and said such comments played to the hands of its opponents.In unusual criticism of a presidential candidate, Pavel, chairman of the NATO Military Committee, said in an interview that Russian ""President (Vladimir) Putin and some others may be pleased by this approach"".""To take such an approach would be a great mistake,"" he said.Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, has criticized the decades-old NATO alliance with mainly European nations - a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy - as obsolete and too costly for the United States.The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was set up in a different era, Trump has said, when the main threat to the West was the Soviet Union. It was ill-suited to fighting terrorism.Pavel, a former Czech Republic army chief, said the NATO alliance formed in 1949 was not perfect but it had great potential as well as the chance to be improved.""Statements like these are not necessarily damaging, but they are not useful,"" Pavel said in Singapore on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's biggest security summit.
On Thursday, Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton also lambasted Trump's foreign policy platform as ""dangerously incoherent"".Trump's emergence as a strong presidential candidate has been a talking point at the Shangri-La Dialogue. Carl Thayer, an Australian security expert, said the prospect of Trump in office would have to be dealt with realistically.Australia's experience had shown that ""you damn well have to work with the U.S. president"", he told a news conference.
FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION
At the meeting, Pavel was to discuss regional issues, including rival claims in the South China Sea and rising tension in Northeast Asia, where North Korea has been stepping up its testing of nuclear capabilities.China and the United States have traded accusations of militarizing the South China Sea, which is claimed almost entirely by Beijing. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam have claims to parts of the waters, through which trade worth trillions of dollars is shipped every year.""Freedom of navigation in this region, through the South China Sea, is crucial for any further development in the region and it's difficult to imagine that without this freedom, there will be stability and peace in this region,"" Pavel said.
NATO could not act on the issue using military means, but mainly political means, he added.North Korea, which conducted its fourth nuclear test in January and followed that with a satellite launch and tests of various missiles, was a great concern for NATO, Pavel said.Western sanctions have not been successful in deterring Pyongyang from developing its nuclear capabilities.""The only country which may change the equation is China,"" Pavel said, pointing to the fact that 90 percent of North Korea's trade is with its big neighbor.Pavel also said he hoped an upcoming NATO summit in Warsaw would agree cyber as an operational domain of war, along with air, sea, land and space.

Michigan lawmakers on Thursday approved paying off a $467 million deficit incurred by Detroit Public Schools and to fund costs associated with creating a new school system, online legislative records showed and local media reported. The state's Republican-controlled House of Representatives approved the bill package, sending the legislation to the state Senate which could take up the legislation when it convenes on Tuesday, according to online records. ""This plan saves Detroit's school system and returns local control to the city, preventing a disastrous bankruptcy that would have affected every community in the state,"" House Speaker Kevin Cotter, a Republican, said in a statement. The legislation has the state paying off $467 million in operating deficit incurred by the cash-strapped school system and providing $125 million to create a new debt-free school district, the news website MLive.com reported. 
The Detroit public school system, or DPS, has nearly 46,000 students. It has been under state control since 2009 because of a financial emergency. Thursday's legislation comes less than a month before DPS was expected to run out of money to pay employees. House Democrats said in a statement that the legislation would force the closing of DPS schools and allow failing charter schools to ""proliferate.""
""House Republicans are playing games with the Detroit Public Schools, and the children of Detroit are the ones who will lose,"" House Democratic Leader Tim Greimel said. 
Democrats also opposed the legislation because it does not include a Detroit Education Commission, a body that would work to prevent low-performing schools from opening and ensure schools are placed in underserved areas, MLive.com reported.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday escalated his attacks on the federal judge presiding over lawsuits against Trump University, saying the judge had ""an absolute conflict"" because of his Mexican heritage, the Wall Street Journal reported.Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, is fighting lawsuits that accuse his school venture of misleading thousands of people who paid up to $35,000 for seminars to learn about the billionaire's real estate investment strategies.In an interview with the newspaper, Trump said U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel had ""an absolute conflict"" in presiding over the litigation given that he was ""of Mexican heritage"" and a member of a Latino lawyers' association.Trump said the background of the judge, who was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrants, was relevant because of his campaign stance against illegal immigration and his pledge to seal the southern U.S. border, the Journal said.""I'm building a wall. It's an inherent conflict of interest,"" Trump said, according to the newspaper.The New York businessman also alleged the judge was a former colleague and friend of one of the Trump University plaintiffs' lawyers, the newspaper said.The judge and the lawyer once worked together as federal prosecutors, but the lawyer, Jason Forge, in an interview with the Journal, said he had never seen the judge socially.
""Neither Judge Curiel's ethnicity nor the fact that we crossed paths as prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office well over a decade ago is to blame"" for Trump's actions, Forge told the Journal.An assistant in Curiel's chambers said he was not commenting on the matter, the newspaper said.At a rally in San Diego last week, Trump lashed out at Curiel. 
""I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump. A hater. He's a hater,"" Trump said. ""We're in front of a very hostile judge. The judge was appointed by Barack Obama,"" Trump said, adding he believed Curiel was Mexican.Legal scholars said Trump could face consequences for slamming the judge, although many have speculated that Curiel was unlikely to sanction him formally.Trump has drawn criticism for his comments about immigrants from Mexico, some of whom he has said were criminals and rapists.
He has proposed building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico to prevent illegal immigration and requiring Mexico to pay for it. (Writing by Eric Beech in Washington; Editing by Peter Cooney)"	['Trump']	[]

By Nick Carey
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Rhetoric against free trade from both likely U.S. presidential nominees poses a risk to the economy and consumers who would lose out if international trade is restrained, the chief executive of the largest U.S. railroad said on Thursday.""Global trade is not getting a fair shake in the dialogue,"" Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N) CEO Lance Fritz said during a discussion with Reuters journalists. ""We've devolved to a form of populism in the rhetoric and that strikes me as having a lot of negative consequences.""Free trade agreements and their impact on U.S. workers have been a major theme in the 2016 campaign for the presidential election on Nov. 8.Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and promised to rip up the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, has criticized the partnership deal, which was signed in February but has not yet won congressional approval. Omaha, Nebraska-based Union Pacific has a growing business serving cross-border trade with Mexico, and over the past decade has reported increased shipments of containers full of consumer goods, many of which come from Asia.Fritz said both candidates are arguing that NAFTA is ""a bad thing,"" even though Trump has been more vocal than Clinton in warning about losing jobs to foreign competition and threatening to slap tariffs on imported goods.
""That's concerning to me,"" Fritz said. ""That's telling the U.S. public that free trade is a bad idea, and that's patently not in the interest of the U.S. consumer.""""We are worried and thinking about what-ifs,"" Fritz said when asked how his company would deal with a Trump or Clinton administration. ""What I'm hoping is we get a little more clarity as we get closer (to the election) and it starts making sense and we can plan around it.""Fritz, who has served as Union Pacific CEO since February 2015, also noted that despite low fuel prices, U.S. consumers still have not taken up the slack in the broader economy.
""We haven't seen a strong consumer in a little while,"" he said.Fritz said he did not know when the railroad would meet its target of an operating ratio, a measure of efficiency, of 55 percent. The ratio expresses operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, so the lower the figure the better. ""We're going to get there as soon as we can in a reasonable fashion,"" he said. Union Pacific posted a first-quarter operating ratio of 65.1 percent.
U.S. railroads generally have a significantly higher operating ratio than the 58.9 percent reported in the first quarter by Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (CP.TO) and Canadian National Railway Co (CNR.TO).Fritz also said Union Pacific would have an anti-collision system mandated by Congress in place by the deadline of 2018. But the company would need the two one-year extensions allowed to ""debug"" the Positive Train Control (PTC) system, he added.Last year, Congress extended the deadline for the system's implementation beyond 2015, despite opposition from some lawmakers following a fatal Amtrak crash in Pennsylvania in May 2015.

Activists have filed a federal lawsuit asking for a new primary election in Baltimore, alleging irregularities during the tight April 26 mayoral vote.The lawsuit was filed by Voters Organized for the Integrity of City Elections, or VOICE, late on Wednesday against the city and state election boards. It asks the U.S. District Court to declare the primary election results invalid, order a new election and appoint federal observers to oversee the procedure.State Senator Catherine Pugh narrowly won the Democratic mayoral primary, defeating former Mayor Sheila Dixon. Pugh had backed law enforcement reform as Baltimore recovers from unrest in April 2015 sparked by a black man's death from an injury suffered while in police custody.
An investigation by the state election board found that Pugh won the nomination by 2,400 votes. About 1,700 ballots cast in the primary were handled improperly, the probe found.Dixon said on Wednesday that she would not file a lawsuit challenging the election outcome. Spokesmen for the two election boards did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The lawsuit alleged improper handling of the ballots. It also alleged that voters were hampered by polling places that opened late and by a letter mistakenly sent by election officials to ex-offenders saying they might not be able to vote because of their convictions.
