WASHINGTON U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's estimated net worth is $3.7 billion, $800 million less than a year ago, Forbes magazine reported on Wednesday, attributing the loss largely to New York's softening real estate market. The magazine probed 28 assets or asset classes owned by the New York businessman and found 18 had declined in value,  including Trump Tower in Manhattan and his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida. The value of his 40 Wall Street property in downtown New York had also declined, according to Forbes, which said it has been tracking Trump's wealth for 34 years. At the same time, one asset remained steady while seven others - including 555 California Street, the second tallest building in San Francisco - saw their value increase, it reported. Representatives for the Trump campaign could not be immediately reached for comment. 
The report comes as Trump, known as a reality television star as well as for his real estate business, heads into the final stretch of campaigning for the Nov. 8 election.Trump, seeking elected office for the first time, has touted his business acumen in pressing for change in Washington. He has vowed to rip up trade deals, negotiate with allies to make them pay more for their U.S. defense protection, and have Mexico pay for a wall he has proposed along the southern U.S. border. If elected, he would be the first billionaire to serve as president, according to Forbes. Details of Trump's wealth are not publicly known because, bucking a decades-old tradition of U.S. presidential candidates, he has refused to release his tax returns. His Democratic rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, earned $10.75 million in 2015 alongside her husband, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, their tax filing showed.
Clinton and others, including some prominent Republicans, have pressed Trump to release his returns. They have also raised questions about his net worth as well as his charitable contributions and business ties. Forbes said its analysis did not place any value on Trump's brand. It also disputed Trump's assertion in Monday night's  presidential debate that he reported $694 million in income from last year to the Federal Election Commission. Forbes said Trump mixed revenue and income in the document.
Trump has so far given $54 million to his presidential campaign. His campaign has also paid his companies for office space in Trump Tower and use of his private airline, among other expenses, federal election filings have shown. Politico reported separately on Wednesday that Trump is considering giving more money to his campaign to fund an advertising blitz, citing three sources close to him.Amid the campaign, Trump made just one real estate deal in the past year: purchasing a Charleston, South Carolina, warehouse that was in foreclosure, Forbes said.

| SACRAMENTO, Calif.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. California Governor Jerry Brown on Wednesday signed a bill to end the statute of limitations for rape, a measure inspired by accusations against comedian Bill Cosby, some of which surfaced decades after alleged crimes occurred.Cosby, who built a long career on family friendly comedy, including his long-running NBC sitcom ""The Cosby Show,"" has steadfastly denied ever assaulting anyone and has insisted that all his sexual encounters were consensual.He is charged in Pennsylvania with drugging and sexually assaulting a former Temple University employee, Andrea Constand, at his home in 2004. In California, he faces a civil suit by a woman now in her 50s who alleges that Cosby plied her with alcohol and molested her in 1974 at the Playboy Mansion when she was aged 15.Existing California law generally limits prosecution of a felony sexual offense to 10 years after the offense is committed.
Only two in 100 rapists will be convicted of a felony and spend any time in prison, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. ""Governor Jerry Brown's signature of SB 813 tells every rape and sexual assault victim in California that they matter and that, regardless of when they are ready to come forward, they will always have an opportunity to seek justice in a court of law,"" said bill author Senator Connie Leyva. 
""Rapists should never be able to evade legal consequences simply because an arbitrary time limit has expired,"" she said.The bill will not work retroactively and will not help some of Cosby's accusers, according to Gloria Allred, an attorney who represents several of the comedian's alleged victims. 
The governors of Nevada and Colorado have signed similar bills extending the statute of limitations to 20 years  for rape cases into law. The California law takes effect on Jan. 1, 2017.

| NEWARK, N.J.

NEWARK, N.J. In December 2013, as the ""Bridgegate"" scandal was unraveling, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's chief spokesman learned the truth: that lanes had been closed at the George Washington Bridge to punish a local mayor for political reasons.That was the testimony from former Port Authority of New York and New Jersey executive David Wildstein on Wednesday, who told jurors in Newark federal court he informed Christie's press secretary Michael Drewniak that he executed the scheme with the approval of Christie aides.Wildstein has said several key figures in Christie's inner circle knew about the plot as it was occurring or soon afterward - including Christie himself, who was told of the closures by Wildstein as they unfolded in September 2013, according to Wildstein's testimony on Tuesday.Christie, who is not accused of wrongdoing, has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the plot at the time, but Wildstein's testimony has bolstered the government's assertion the governor knew about the scandal earlier than he has acknowledged. The scandal helped derail Christie's bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and could endanger his best chance at a political future: a role in Donald Trump's administration should the Republican presidential candidate win a Nov. 8 election.
The governor's former deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, and a former Port Authority executive, Bill Baroni, are charged with deliberately creating gridlock in Fort Lee, New Jersey, after the town's mayor declined to endorse Christie's 2013 re-election bid.Wildstein said on Wednesday he met with Drewniak on Dec. 4 and offered to resign.""I told him the stories were out of control,"" Wildstein said. ""This wasn't going away.""
Drewniak has previously confirmed that Wildstein told him of the closures, but has denied knowing it was political payback.Wildstein also said he met with Christie's chief counsel, Charlie McKenna, two days later and told him about the scheme, though he did not say whether he disclosed the motivation for the plot.Wildstein previously said he informed Michael DuHaime, a Christie adviser, in November. He has also testified that Christie's campaign manager, Bill Stepien; David Samson, the chairman of the Port Authority; and a board member, Pat Schuber, were aware of the plot beforehand.
Stepien's lawyer has said he had no role in the scheme, while Samson and Schuber have denied advance knowledge.Defense lawyers began questioning Wildstein on Wednesday and sought to portray him as the true mastermind of the scheme, even though Baroni was nominally his superior.Michael Baldassare, a lawyer for Baroni, also suggested Wildstein's testimony was biased because he is seeking a reduced sentence after pleading guilty to two counts of conspiracy.

By Scott Malone
| BOSTON

BOSTON A 2014 New Hampshire law prohibiting voters from taking selfies with their ballots on election day is an unconstitutional infringement on the right to free speech, a federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday.The New England state had banned the practice, which has become a popular way for voters to show support for favored candidates, claiming that it would set the stage for a return of the vote-buying scandals that rocked many U.S. states in the 19th century.Three New Hampshire citizens, including a man who wrote in the name of his dog to express dismay at his choices in the 2014 Republican primary for the U.S. Senate, sued the state that year claiming the measure violated their rights to free expression, as protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.A federal court in New Hampshire sided with them, but the state appealed, making its case in Boston just two weeks ago. The appeals court swiftly rejected its arguments.
""The statute's purposes cannot justify the restrictions it imposes on speech,"" Circuit Judge Sandra Lynch wrote in the court's decision.New Hampshire's argument that ballot selfies could lead to people selling their votes or being compelled by their employers to vote in a certain way fell short in no small part because the state had no evidence of that actually happening, Lynch wrote.
""The legislative history of the bill does not contain any corroborated evidence of vote buying or voter coercion in New Hampshire during the 20th and 21st centuries,"" she wrote. ""Digital photography, the internet, and social media are not unknown quantities -- they have been ubiquitous for several election cycles, without being shown to have the effect of furthering vote buying or voter intimidation.""Lynch also noted that several federal and state laws in effect in New Hampshire already make it illegal to buy or sell a vote, which would allow prosecutors to take on allegations of election tampering even in an environment where selfies were permitted.
Other states, including nearby Rhode Island, have passed laws explicitly allowing ballot selfies, partly reasoning that the trend has helped younger voters show their enthusiasm for the democratic process. (Reporting by Scott Malone; Editing by Tom Brown)"

By Timothy Mclaughlin
| CHICAGO

CHICAGO Underperforming schools in the cash-strapped city of Detroit can be closed this school year, Michigan's Attorney General said in a legal opinion issued Wednesday to clarify an existing state law. The position is the latest development in a battle between the state's Republican and Democratic lawmakers over how best to address Detroit's struggling school system.   Attorney General Bill Schuette, a Republican, said schools operated by the Detroit Public School Community District that are among the lowest achieving 5 percent of all public schools during the three preceding school years can be shuttered by the state's School Reform Officer (SRO).Republican Governor Rick Snyder, who in June approved a dramatic restructuring of Detroit's school system, previously accepted the opinion of an outside law firm that the SRO could not close schools until 2019, according to the Detroit Free Press.  ""The law is clear: Michigan parents and their children do not have to be stuck indefinitely in a failing school,"" Schuette said in a statement on Wednesday. ""Detroit students and parents deserve accountability and high performing schools. If a child can't spell opportunity, they won't have opportunity."" 
Some Democrats argue that the newly restructured school district needs additional time to re-evaluate the performance of schools and integrate best learning practices. Schuette's opinion said the SRO could issue a mandatory notice of closure to a school, which would then determine the best time to close before the end of the current school term.  If a school is closed, students will be re-assigned to another school. 
The Detroit public school system, which has nearly 46,000 students, has been under state control since 2009 because of a financial emergency. Of the 124 worst-performing schools in the state, 47 are Detroit public schools, according to a list released by the SRO earlier this month. The recent restructuring of the school system splits it into two distinct parts in an effort to improve the academically and financially struggling system. 
Ari Adler, a spokesman for Snyder's office, said on Wednesday that the governor's office was reviewing Schuette's legal opinion. Republican House Speaker Kevin Cotter, who asked for a clarification of the law from Schuette welcomed the decision on Wednesday. ""Detroit students need a final decision, and this opinion provides one,"" Cotter said in a statement. State Representative Sherry Gay-Dagnogo, a Democrat representing northwest Detroit, slammed Schuette's opinion, describing the attorney general as ""totally out of touch with the needs of our community.""

CHICAGO The Illinois Attorney General has appealed a federal judge ruling that blocks same-day registration at polling places in the state's most populous counties, a spokeswoman for the office said on Wednesday. The appeal submitted by the state's Attorney General, Lisa Madigan, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, seeks to reverse a ruling that bars Election Day voter registration at polling places in counties with populations of 100,000 or more. Such registrations were allowed under a state law enacted last year.The appeal was filed on Tuesday evening, according to court documents and Maura Possley, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General's Office. The ruling, issued Tuesday by Judge Samuel Der-Yeghiayan of the Northern District of Illinois, resulted from a federal court lawsuit brought in August against the state law by a group aligned with a conservative think tank and came six weeks before the Nov. 8 election.[nL2N1C321W]
The Chicago-based Liberty Justice Center, which filed the lawsuit, argued that the population threshold unconstitutionally discriminated against voters in less populated counties and boosted Democrats in heavily Democratic Cook County, where Chicago is located.In his ruling, Der-Yeghiayan wrote that the law provided an advantage to urban voters over their rural counterparts.
The law, passed in late 2014 by the Democratic-led legislature and signed into law in early 2015 by former Democratic Governor Pat Quinn, allowed Election Day voter registration for the first time, including at polling places.
But the section of the law regarding polling place registration pertained only to counties with populations of 100,000 or more. (Reporting by Timothy Mclaughlin; Editing by Frances Kerry)"

Earnest said some lawmakers had only recently been informed about potential drawbacks to approving the legislation.
""For those senators to then move forward in overriding the president's veto that would prevent those negative consequences is an abdication of their basic responsibilities as elected representatives of the American people,"" he said.

CHICAGO Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday sought to allay the concerns of Polish-Americans who questioned him about his commitment to Poland given his tough stance on NATO and talk of working with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Trump, at a small roundtable meeting with Polish-American leaders, heard their concerns about his demand that NATO nations bear more of the financial burden of their defense and his words of praise for Putin.""As president I will honor Poland's sacrifices for freedom. We're committed to a strong Poland, very committed, totally committed, and a strong Eastern Europe as a bulwark for freedom and security,"" Trump said.Trump has rattled NATO allies and many U.S. national security experts by saying that if elected on Nov. 8, he would demand that NATO members pay up their defense contributions of 2 percent of GDP or else have to pay for their own security.
Many nations in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have lagged in their defense spending, to the frustration of U.S. leaders, but there has never been a move to cut them out of the U.S. security umbrella because of this.In Chicago, Trump hailed Poland as being up to date with its defense contributions.
""We want NATO to be strong which means we want more nations to follow the example of Poland,"" Trump said. ""If all made the same contributions as Poland, all our allies would be more secure.""There are an estimated 9.5 million Americans of Polish descent in the United States, many of them clustered in Midwestern states that may play an important role in deciding who wins the election.
Tim Kuzma, president of a group called the Polish Falcons of America, told Reuters that during the small roundtable event Trump was asked about whether he would be a strong friend to Poland.The message to Trump was ""Would a Trump administration support Poland?"" Kuzma said. ""Would a Trump administration honor the commitments to NATO? And he was very affirmative that he would and that he believes in a strong NATO.""

BOSTON The Washington Post on Wednesday called on Maine Governor Paul LePage to resign, following a series of incidents in which the two-term Republican made racially charged statements and threatened a Democratic lawmaker in an obscenity-laden email.LePage, whose term extends through 2018, last month lashed out at a state lawmaker who criticized his comments blaming black and Hispanic people from out of state for the heroin trade in Maine.In an editorial titled ""Maine's unhinged governor,"" the newspaper wrote ""LePage threatens to remake his state's image from a vacation paradise of surreal natural beauty to a hotbed of hatred.""LePage had told reporters he had collected a three-ring binder of people arrested for trafficking drugs in the state and that 90 percent of those in it were black or Hispanic. The governor released the binder this week and a review by local media found that closer to one in three arrestees in it matched LePage's description.
Maine legislative leaders last month briefly considered convening a special session to reprimand LePage for the outburst, but the effort collapsed with the two parties unable to agree on whether they wanted to censure him or pursue impeachment.A spokeswoman for the governor dismissed the editorial as biased.
""The Post did not contact anyone from the governor's office to fact-check this biased piece of propaganda,"" spokeswoman Adrienne Bennett said in an email. ""Clearly, the Post editorial board is exempt from reporting facts.""Asked about what factual inaccuracies in the editorial concerned the governor, Bennett challenged the Post's description of LePage declining to attend a 2011 Martin Luther King Jr. Day event hosted by the state's NAACP chapter, noting that he had instead attended a Rotary Club event honoring the slain civil rights activist.
At the time that he declined the NAACP's invitation, in his first month as governor, LePage said that critics of his decision could ""kiss my butt."" (Reporting by Scott Malone; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Lisa Shumaker)"
