WASHINGTON Democrat Bernie Sanders is expected to endorse presidential rival Hillary Clinton on Tuesday at a campaign event in New Hampshire, The New York Times reported on Thursday.Citing three Democrats who have been involved in the planning, the Times said the endorsement was partly the result of daily talks between the candidates' campaign managers about bringing them together and advancing Sanders' policy priorities.The Sanders campaign declined to comment.Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, has resisted endorsing Clinton in a show of party unity since she clinched the Democratic nomination last month. Sanders chose to continue his campaign as leverage to win concessions on his liberal policy agenda and reforms to the Democratic Party nominating process.
In a speech to supporters last month, Sanders vowed to help Clinton defeat Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election but did not end his campaign.Sanders risked being left behind, however, as other prominent Democrats have rallied around Clinton, including President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a favorite of the party's liberal wing.
Clinton, who shifted to the left under pressure from Sanders during the campaign, adopted another of his issues on Wednesday when she proposed eliminating tuition at public colleges and universities for in-state students whose families earn less than $125,000 annually.
Sanders' endorsement is expected to ensure he has a prominent speaking slot at the Democratic convention later this month, the Times quoted the three Democrats as saying. (Writing by John Whitesides; Editing by Mohammad Zargham and Leslie Adler)"

MOSCOW A foreign-policy adviser to U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump avoided all questions about how the United States should shape its policy toward Russia on a visit to Moscow on Thursday.Carter Page said at a lecture he gave to students and business figures organized by Moscow's New Economic School that he did not want to comment on the U.S. election campaign.Page declined to say whether he was planning to meet anyone from the Kremlin, the Russian government or Foreign Ministry during his visit.Trump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination for the U.S. presidential election, has made contradictory comments about Russia but made headlines with warm words for President Vladimir Putin. Putin called Trump ""very talented"", fuelling speculation the Kremlin would be pleased to see Trump in the White House, but later rowed back from those comments.
In his lecture on Thursday, Trump's adviser Page said Western governments had often had a hypocritical focus on democratization, corruption and inequality in the post-Soviet world.He also accused the United States and its partners of ""proactive steps to encourage regime change overseas"".
""This may understandably advance a certain level of insecurity,"" Page said.Relations between the United States and Russia have deteriorated sharply under U.S. leader Barack Obama, undermined by disagreements over the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria.
The Obama administration imposed sanctions on Russia in 2014 over Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and fights on the opposing side of the five-year-old Syrian civil war.Page worked in Russia for U.S. investment bank Merrill Lynch in the mid-2000s and said in an interview with Bloomberg in March that he was an investor in Russian gas producer Gazprom.

| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. lawmakers sharply criticized President Barack Obama's administration on Thursday over the disappearance of a former Guantanamo detainee, calling for an end to transfers from the prison because of fears former prisoners could launch attacks on Americans.They also raised concerns about reports that Jihad Diyab, a Syrian among six detainees resettled in Uruguay in December 2014, has disappeared and may now be in Brazil.Obama is working to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, where terrorism suspects have been held for 15 years, by transferring detainees not considered security threats to foreign countries.Republican lawmakers worry that the Obama administration is so eager to close the prison before he leaves office in January that it is sending detainees to countries that cannot ensure they will not return to the battlefield by joining militant groups that target Americans and U.S. allies.""You're talking about detainees who have every intent of killing American families,"" Republican Representative Joe Wilson of South Carolina said at a House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. The administration has considered sending Guantanamo detainees to a prison in South Carolina.The New York Times reported that Diyab said last month he was going on a religious retreat that would last into next week, and would be unreachable by telephone or email.Since then, some Uruguayan officials said they lost track of him and suggested he may have traveled to Brazil, the newspaper reported.""Many countries just aren't up to the job,"" said Republican Representative Ed Royce, the committee's chairman. ""... Yet the administration has sent Guantanamo terrorists to these countries anyway.""
Republican and some Democratic committee members sharply questioned Lee Wolosky, the State Department's special envoy for closing the Guantanamo detention center, and Paul Lewis, his Pentagon counterpart.Representative Jeff Duncan, another South Carolina Republican, said Diyab, charged with forging passports for al Qaeda, could pose a threat to the upcoming Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, if he were indeed at large in that country.The committee's ranking Democrat, Representative Eliot Engel, who backs the closure of the detention center in Cuba, said it was important to keep the issue in perspective.""Under no circumstances, in my opinion, is the Obama administration simply opening the gate and releasing dangerous terrorists onto the street,"" Engel said.  
FEW RETURN TO BATTLEFIELD
Lewis and Wolosky said only 5 percent of detainees transferred since Obama became president have been confirmed to have returned to the battlefield. The percentage was higher for the over 500 released under President George W. Bush.There are currently 79 detainees at Guantanamo, of whom 29 are eligible for transfer.
Wolosky acknowledged Diyab had been ""difficult"" from the time he was transferred to Uruguay. According to the Times, Diyab's friends and supporters say he is off praying and will re-emerge soon.Obama has been trying to make good on his 2009 pledge to close the facility. But Congress has passed laws making it more difficult to do so, chiefly by barring transfers to U.S. prisons.Lawmakers are unlikely to lift those restrictions, especially in an election year. They have proposed even tighter controls on transfers in a fiscal 2017 defense policy bill, one reason Obama has threatened a veto.Guantanamo opponents say holding prisoners for years without charge or trial goes against fundamental U.S. values and since they are Muslims, is a recruiting tool for Islamist militants.Many Republicans insist the prison is an essential tool for handling suspects who threaten the United States. Donald Trump, the party's presumptive 2016 presidential nominee, has called for the prison's expansion. (Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)"

WASHINGTON U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday ""all options"" were being considered over the possible discipline of House Democrats for protests they held on the House floor to call for action on gun-control measures.With Democrats already rejecting a Republican gun bill and warning of further protests, the Republican-controlled House appeared to be heading for renewed discord over gun restrictions following the June 12 mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.Ryan, who was speaking at a news conference, had previously said the House would vote this week on a measure intended to keep guns out of the hands of people the government suspects of involvement in violent extremism. But it is no longer clear when a vote might be held.
Democrats say the Republican-backed legislation is inadequate because authorities would have only three days to convince a judge that a gun sale should be blocked.

WASHINGTON International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde warned in an interview published on Thursday that anti-trade policies like those championed by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump risked a protectionist movement that could severely damage global growth.Lagarde told the Financial Times that with Britain's vote to leave the European Union already casting a shadow over global growth, the imposition of new trade barriers in another larger economy could have ""disastrous"" effects.""I think it would be quite disastrous, actually. Well I don't think I should say disastrous because that is an excessive word and I should refrain from excessive words. But it would certainly have a negative impact on global growth,"" she told the FT in response to a question about such policies.The newspaper said that while Lagarde made clear her negative views of anti-trade rhetoric and policies, she refrained from referring to Trump by name or singling out any politician.
Lagarde also told the FT that she doubted that a prolonged period of uncertainty over Britain's exit, without triggering formal separation negotiations, would be politically sustainable.""We want to see clarity sooner rather than later because we think that a lack of clarity feeds uncertainty, which itself undermines investment appetites and decision making,"" Lagarde told the newspaper.
In a separate interview with Agence France Presse, Lagarde said Brexit was unlikely to cause a world recession, adding that the immediate effects would hurt the UK, with some spillover to the euro area.
She told AFP that proposals in Britain to cut corporate tax rates to 15 percent from 20 percent to counter the damage caused by the UK's EU divorce was a ""race to the bottom"" that would hurt other economies. (Reporting By David Lawder; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)"

By Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Top Republicans in the U.S. Congress pressed for sanctions on Thursday against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified information, with House Speaker Paul Ryan formally asking she be denied such information during the campaign.Ryan, the top Republican in the House of Representatives, sent a letter to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper saying denying Clinton access to classified information would be an appropriate sanction for her mishandling of classified data while she was secretary of state.Ten Republican senators said on Thursday they had written Secretary of State John Kerry asking that the State Department immediately suspend security clearances of Clinton and aides Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills, Jake Sullivan and other former State Department employees for security violations.The calls for sanctions against Clinton come after FBI Director James Comey rebuked her on Tuesday for ""extremely careless"" handling of classified information while using private email servers for business while secretary of state during President Barack Obama's first term.
Comey recommended no criminal charges be filed but indicated administrative sanctions could be taken against Clinton or her aides. Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Wednesday accepted Comey's recommendation that no criminal charges were warranted and closed the case.Republican lawmakers and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump have expressed outrage that the case was not being pursued.Ryan, in a letter dated Wednesday, formally asked Clapper to ""refrain from providing any classified information to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the duration of her candidacy for president"" because of the FBI's findings. The letter was obtained by Reuters from a source familiar with the matter.
Ryan, a Republican vice presidential candidate in 2012, said he was aware Clinton would begin receiving classified intelligence briefings after the Democratic National Convention if she is formally nominated as expected. Presidential candidates are customarily provided such briefings.""Given the FBI's findings, denying Secretary Clinton access to classified information certainly constitutes appropriate sanctions,"" Ryan said in the letter.
Republican senators, including former Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio, said in their letter to Kerry that it was clear from Comey's comments on Tuesday that Clinton and her aides should have their security clearances immediately suspended if they still have them.""There is simply no excuse for Hillary Clinton's decision to set up a home-cooked email system which left sensitive and classified national security information vulnerable to theft and exploitation by America's enemies,"" the letter said.

By Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of private email while secretary of state is closed, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on Wednesday, removing a legal cloud that threatened the presumptive Democratic nominee's presidential bid.  Lynch said she accepted the Federal Bureau of Investigation's recommendations that no charges be brought in the probe, as Republicans made clear they would not let Clinton's email headaches fade away easily.""I received and accepted their unanimous recommendation that the thorough, year-long investigation be closed and that no charges be brought against any individuals within the scope of the investigation,"" Lynch said in a statement.With the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential and congressional elections beginning to heat up, Republicans called on the administration to make public key documents in the Clinton email case.Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, speaking at a campaign rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, accused Clinton, his likely Democratic opponent, of bribing Lynch to decide not to press charges.He was referring to reports, including in the New York Times this week, that Clinton, if elected president, might ask Lynch to stay on as attorney general.""She said she's going to reappoint the attorney general and the attorney general is waiting to make a determination as to whether or not she's guilty. And boy was that a fast determination, wow,"" Trump said, adding, ""That's bribery folks.""On Capitol Hill, Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 3 House of Representatives Republican, reacted to Lynch's announcement by proclaiming: ""Secretary Clinton broke the law and lied about it.""
Senior Senate Republicans insisted that the FBI's investigation be made available to the public, including a transcript of the more than three hours Clinton spent last Saturday in an interview conducted by the agency.Shortly before Lynch's announcement, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters, ""I think the next step...is to compare what Hillary Clinton said to the FBI with what Hillary Clinton's been saying to all of us over the last couple of years during this controversy.""In a blistering attack on Clinton, John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican, said on the Senate floor: ""The bottom line is Secretary Clinton actively sought out ways to hide her actions as much as possible"" by using a private email account while heading the State Department. ""And in so doing, she put our country at risk"" by leaving those emails vulnerable to computer hackers.Democrats have questioned Republicans' motives and accused them of squandering taxpayer dollars with lengthy investigations that have failed to uncover illegal activities.
""Republicans are in such desperate shape because of Trump (that) they would seize upon anything"" to divert attention, said Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid.And Senator Patrick Leahy, the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement following Lynch's announcement: ""This investigation is closed and that should be the end of this matter.""On Tuesday, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, had been ""extremely careless"" in her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, but he recommended no criminal charges be filed in the case.Comey, who was deputy attorney general during the George W. Bush administration before becoming FBI director in 2013, is scheduled to testify on Thursday before a House committee, where Republicans and Democrats are expected to press him on his findings in the Clinton case.Lynch said she met on Wednesday afternoon with Comey and the career prosecutors and agents who had investigated whether Clinton broke the law as result of email servers kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home. One question is whether she mishandled classified information.
House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, said on Wednesday it appeared Clinton received preferential treatment from the FBI.Asked whether a special prosecutor should be named to investigate the matter, Ryan said the House would not ""foreclose any options.""But Ryan did say that because of her messy handling of emails while serving as secretary of state, Clinton should be denied access to classified information during the campaign.Presidential candidates normally get such briefings once they are formally nominated. McConnell, Ryan's Senate counterpart, stopped short of calling for such action.Clinton's campaign was anxious to move on after Comey's announcement, saying in a statement on Tuesday it was pleased with the FBI decision.

NEW YORK Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Thursday will unveil proposals to help small businesses fight fraudulent practices by larger firms, tactics her campaign will compare to the business record of her Republican rival, Donald Trump.  The plan would enhance legal protections for small businesses when large firms don't pay their bills, increase federal regulatory enforcement, and expand working capital for small businesses, according to a Clinton official.The proposal comes a day after Clinton, in Atlantic City, lambasted Trump for what she described as profiting from exploiting workers in the slumping seaside town.A Reuters special report last year found Trump sometimes refuses to pay bills from contractors he has hired and then forces them to negotiate the final figure down.
The new plan from the former secretary of state highlights a major division in the Democratic and Republican campaigns for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Trump, a New York real estate developer, often highlights his businesses as among his biggest qualifications for office, promising to do for the country what he says he has done for his companies. 
But Clinton and others have harshly criticized Trump's business practices and argue that running a country is a far different proposition from running a private enterprise. 
Clinton and several campaign surrogates will take her new small business proposal to 10 states, including key election battlegrounds of Florida and Nevada, pointing to Donald Trump's Atlantic City casino bankruptcies as a warning sign for voters.
