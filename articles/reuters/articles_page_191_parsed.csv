By Amanda Becker
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democrat Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday that if Republican rival Donald Trump wins the White House, it will be a disaster for the U.S. economy, predicting a ""Trump recession.""""Now I don't say this because of typical political disagreements - liberals and conservatives say Trump's ideas would be disastrous,"" Clinton said. ""Economists on the right, the left and the center all agree Trump would throw us back into recession.""Clinton's speech in Columbus, Ohio, a state that will be a battleground in the Nov. 8 election, was the second in which she has argued the wealthy businessman is ""temperamentally unfit"" to lead the country. The first was on foreign relations and national security.""Donald Trump has said he is qualified to be president because of his business record,"" Clinton said.""So let's take a look at what he did for his businesses: He's written a lot of books about business. They all seem to end at Chapter 11; go figure,"" Clinton said, in a jab referring to Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
Clinton then said Trump, a self-described ""king of debt,"" had allowed businesses to amass huge debts and declare bankruptcy, leaving hundreds of people without jobs and wiping out shareholders.Allowing the United States to accrue similar debt would rattle investors and could lead to economic catastrophe, she added.On Twitter during Clinton's speech, Trump said, ""I am 'the king of debt.' That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U.S.""
Clinton also said the likely Republican nominee's tax plan - which aims to simplify the tax code, along with slashing the top corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent - would benefit the wealthy over working families. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimated the plan would increase the federal deficit by $9.5 trillion over the next decade.The former secretary of state also said Trump's plan to scrap trade deals could start ""trade wars"" and that the agreements should instead be renegotiated if they do not benefit American workers.
 Clinton said Trump's plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and deport undocumented immigrants would shake the workforce and prove disastrous for the U.S. economy, creating a ""Trump recession.""The tussle over the economy came as the two continued preparing for what is expected to be a fierce campaign. Trump was slated to give a speech criticizing Clinton in New York on Wednesday.As the presumptive Democratic nominee spoke on Tuesday, Trump's campaign tested what appeared to be a more active rapid-response operation, sending emails saying Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, had backed bad trade deals and that her immigration plan would lower wages.

WASHINGTON The American Bar Association issued a glowing evaluation of President Barack Obama's U.S. Supreme Court nominee on Tuesday, giving Merrick Garland its highest rating even as Senate Republicans stood firm in their blockade of his appointment.The influential lawyers association, which has evaluated the qualifications of nominees to the federal judiciary since 1953, deemed Garland ""well qualified,"" the highest of its three ratings, for a lifetime job on America's highest court.""The unanimous consensus of everyone we interviewed was  that Judge Garland is superbly competent to serve on the United  States Supreme Court,"" the ABA panel that conducted the evaluation said in a report.Obama nominated Garland, 63, on March 16 to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13. Garland is a centrist jurist with two decades as a federal appeals court judge.A nominee's ABA rating typically is considered when the Senate acts on a judicial appointment.Republicans were unswayed. In an emailed statement, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office pointed out that Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, when they were senators, tried to block the 2006 Supreme Court confirmation of conservative Samuel Alito, even though he also earned the ABA's highest rating. 
Supreme Court nominations require Senate confirmation, and the Republicans who control the chamber have denied Garland customary hearings and a confirmation vote. Senate Republican leaders have vowed not to act on any Supreme Court nominee put forward by Obama, arguing that the next president, to be elected on Nov. 8 and take office on Jan. 20, should fill Scalia's vacancy.Obama has accused Senate Republicans of abdicating their constitutional duties. The court is now split 4-4 between conservatives and liberals, meaning Scalia's successor could influence its ideological direction for years to come.
The White House renewed its demand that the Senate act on Garland. Spokesman Josh Earnest said ""it is such a shame he has been treated so unfairly by the United States Senate"" in an ""unprecedented partisan action.""The Republicans are hoping their presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, wins the presidency and nominates a conservative to the court.""This significant point warrants repeating,"" the ABA panel wrote.
""All of the experienced, dedicated and knowledgeable sitting judges, several former solicitor generals from both political parties, legal scholars from top law schools across the country,  and lawyers who have worked with or against the nominee in private practice, government or within the judiciary describe  the nominee as outstanding in all respects and cite specific evidence in support of that view.""

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he is willing to tap into his personal funds to cover any fundraising deficit he faces against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, after finishing May more than $40 million behind her in cash. ""If need be, there could be unlimited 'cash on hand' as I would put up my own money, as I have already done through the primaries, spending over $50 million,"" Trump said in a statement. ""Our campaign is leaner and more efficient, like our government should be.""

WASHINGTON The U.S. military will not provide details on specific cases of American service members injured in Iraq and Syria because it could give information to Islamic State militants, a Pentagon spokesman said on TuesdayThe spokesman, Peter Cook, was responding to a question at a Pentagon press briefing seeking confirmation that four Americans had been wounded in Syria earlier this month. Cook said there had been no a change in policy and aggregate numbers would still be provided.""Our policy is not to identify wounded service members for a variety of reasons, including operational security, including privacy reasons,"" Cook said. 
""Also, we do not want to provide additional information to the enemy that might enhance their own assessment on the battlefield situation,"" he said.However, the Pentagon has released such information in the past and responded to queries, and it was unclear how Cook's comments were consistent with previous disclosures.
Last month a spokesman said two U.S. service member had been injured, one each in Iraq and Syria, during the last weekend in May. Captain Jeff Davis said the incident in Iraq took place in the north, near Erbil, while the injury in Syria was north of Raqqa, Islamic State's de facto capital.According to Pentagon data, there have been 16 American service members wounded in action since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve, the military's name for an operation targeting Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria which started in 2014. 
Cook's comments came the same day that President Barack Obama visited Walter Reed National Military Medical Center; he has visited wounded U.S. service members there throughout his presidency.  (Reporting by Idrees Ali; Editing by Leslie Adler)"	['Cook', 'Obama']	[]

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on Tuesday proposed overhauling the state's education funding formula to provide all public school districts with a flat rate of $6,599 per student.Calling it his ""Fairness Formula"" in policy statements on Tuesday, Christie said aid for special needs students would continue even with any potential formula change.Schools are funded through property taxes, which in New Jersey are some of the highest in the nation because of the state's ""unaffordable and broken school funding formula propped up by special interests and misguided Supreme Court precedent,"" Christie said in a statement.He said he would traverse the state this summer to talk about the proposal. The amount of state aid school districts receive now varies widely, with some getting less than $3,000 per pupil and others getting as much as $28,000
Such a change would be an uphill battle, as it would need approval from a Democrat-led legislature that has already rejected previous education formula changes from Christie, a Republican.
""Governor Christie's idea is unconstitutional and harmful to our most vulnerable children,"" Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that Christie still hasn't fully funded schools under the existing formula.Currently, poorer districts receive more state aid under a formula based on a 1990 New Jersey Supreme Court decision called     Abbott v. Burke II, which ruled the state's education funding was unfair and that low-income ""Abbott districts"" must be funded on par with wealthier ones.

By Sarah Young
| DORKING, England

DORKING, England A man charged with trying to attack Donald Trump with a policeman's gun found it hard to cope with life but did not have political views and was never violent, his father told British media on Tuesday.   Michael Sandford was arrested after trying to grab a police officer's side arm at a Trump rally in Las Vegas on Saturday. When asked why, he told police: ""To shoot and kill Trump,"" according to U.S. court papers. ""He's never shown any violent tendencies before. He's never been a bad person,"" his father, Paul Davey, was quoted as saying by the MailOnline website which put Sandford's age as 20. U.S. prosecutors have said he is 19.  ""He's a nice kid and literally wouldn't hurt a fly - he used to tell us not to use fly spray because he didn't want any flies to die.""The Mirror newspaper's website quoted Davey as saying his son had Asperger's Syndrome and had left school at the age of 15 ""because he couldn't cope with it all"". He went to the United States 18 months ago after an American girl he had met returned home, something that had made him ""quite down and depressed,"" Davey said.""He's been refusing to come back and we were worried about him, we were in contact with the American Embassy ... (but) the American authorities said 'he's over 18 we can't do anything.'""
Davey said someone must have coerced or ""radicalised"" his son into attacking the presidential candidate.""He has never mentioned Donald Trump. The reason it is such a shock is because he shows no interest in anything like that ... I doubt he would even know who the president of the United States is.""Sandford lived on his own in Dorking, a commuter town near London, in a flat in a large white house.
A local who knew Sandford's mother, who did not want to be named, told Reuters Sandford had autism and obsessive-compulsive disorder. ""He was one of those guys who just stays in his room that's it, wouldn't come out,"" the man said. The U.S. court documents said Sandford had been planning to kill Trump for about a year. He had visited a gun range the day before the rally to fire a weapon for the first time. Last week, a British member of parliament was shot and stabbed to death in the street - an incident that has shocked a country that has strict gun controls and where attacks on public figures are rare.
Media reported that Sandford and his mother had taken part in a ""Robot Wars"" competition where contestants operate robots trying to destroy their opponents' machine.A web page for the Fighting Robots Association listed Michael and Lynne Sandford and Paul Davey as owners of a number of robots, including machines named 'Mr Nasty', 'X-Terminator' and 'Steel Avenger'. ""He was quite active in the robot community for a while - buying famous robots from the show ... I then got them working for him because he had absolutely no idea about robots,"" John Findlay, director of the company behind Robot Wars, told the Mirror newspaper.  ""He was calm, very quiet, a little bit weird and reserved."" (Writing by William James; Editing by Robin Pomeroy)"	['Paul', 'Trump']	[]

By Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama's nominee to lead the U.S. military in Africa on Tuesday backed the idea of gaining greater power to strike Islamic State, including in Libya, which he described as the group's Plan B as it loses territory in Iraq and Syria.Marine Lieutenant General Thomas Waldhauser told his Senate confirmation hearing that the U.S. military was making preparations for possible military strikes in Libya against the militants.But Waldhauser noted limitations on the current commander's ability to order strikes against the group in Libya, which require adhering to White House guidance. That differs from the rules of engagement in Iraq or Syria.Asked by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham whether it would be wise for Obama to give the commander of the Africa Command the authority to go after Islamic State targets in Africa ""on your own,"" Waldhauser said: ""It would be wise.""""It would certainly contribute to what we're trying to do inside Libya,"" he responded.
Islamic State established a presence in several parts of the country from 2014, and has been active between Benghazi and the militant group's coastal stronghold of Sirte, about 380 km (240 miles) to the west.In recent weeks, however, the ultra-hardline group has retreated into the center of Sirte after forces aligned with Libya's U.N.-backed unity government advanced from the western city of Misrata.One reason Islamic State established itself in Sirte, Waldhauser told the Senate Armed Services Committee, was ""to be kind of a backup if Iraq and Syria fail,"" he said. 
Waldhauser estimated that Islamic State faced between 3,000 and 4,000 opponents fighting the group around Sirte, drawn from the Mirsratan militia forces and the Petroleum Facilities Guard Central Branch. But he cautioned that alliances can shift among the Libyan militia, driven by everything from tribal ties and religious beliefs to material gain.
""The unpredictable nature of paramilitary group patronage will most likely remain a significant obstacle to the GNA's efforts to establish sovereignty,"" he said in written testimony.For months, the United States has had a small number of U.S. forces rotating in and out of Libya, establishing contact with fighters inside the country. Waldhauser said they were acting in an advisory role to support the unity government, and said no more U.S. troops were needed in the country at this time.

By Grant Smith, Michelle Conlin and Ginger Gibson
| NEW YORK/WASHINGTON

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump's campaign raised $3.1 million from donors in May, more than doubling previous monthly hauls as he began soliciting donations to battle Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.But with spending that outpaced inflows, the New York real estate magnate's campaign began June with just $1.29 million in cash, putting it well-behind Clinton's $42 million war chest, according to federal disclosures filed late on Monday. Clinton's campaign raised $26 million in May. The figures underscore the huge money advantage Clinton is hoping to enjoy leading into the Nov. 8 election, one that could allow her a large staff and millions of dollars of television and digital ads in battleground states.Trump, who has self-funded most of his campaign and only held his first general election fundraiser on May 25, is betting he can run a race that builds on his low-spending, insurgent primary operation.Trump's surrogates, however, have said the cash is now ""pouring in"" for the general election. For months the biggest cash injections into Trump's campaign coffers were from his personal bank accounts. He has loaned his campaign $46 million since launching last year.
Trump may still have several hurdles to cross before convincing deep-pocketed donors to write the kind of checks that would make him competitive with Clinton's campaign bank account.Trump donors, allies and other Republican operatives continue to express concerns about his campaign operation, which has been dogged by internal battles, a threadbare campaign infrastructure of about 30 paid staffers, and a barely existent fundraising apparatus.On Monday, Trump fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who had been tasked with overseeing the campaign's fundraising arm. 
The primary Super PAC supporting Trump, Great America PAC, reported raising $1.4 million in May - accounting for most of the $2.5 million the group has raised this year. The PAC had $500,971 cash remaining at the beginning of June.Clinton's cash advantage has been fueled in part by the Super PAC supporting her. Priorities USA raised $12 million in the last month, ending May with a $52 million in cash. Three unions, AFT Solidarity, Liuna Building America and International Union of Operating Engineers, each gave $1 million.The group has largely been tasked with attacking Trump. And so far, they have spent more than $5.7 million this year on television ads alone attacking the Republican.
