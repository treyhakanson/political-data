By Mike Blake
| LOS ANGELES

LOS ANGELES Hillary Clinton fought on two fronts in California on Saturday as she sought to wrap up her battle with Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination, taking aim at him and at Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, with attacks on their immigration stances.Both Clinton and Sanders campaigned across California, stopping in immigrant communities, big cities and the agricultural heartland on the final weekend before Tuesday's primary in the nation's biggest state.Clinton used a stop at a Los Angeles-area college to criticize Trump for making ""hateful, very prejudicial"" statements about immigrants and Sanders for voting against a 2007 comprehensive immigration reform bill.""I was in the Senate then, so was President Obama and so was Senator Sanders. President Obama and I voted for it, Senator Sanders voted against it. And that ended it,"" Clinton said.""It was heartbreaking,"" she added.Latinos comprise almost 40 percent of California's population of roughly 39 million.Clinton, also a former secretary of state, is expected to sew up the party nomination on Tuesday, when California is one of six state holding nominating contests. Except for Washington, D.C., those states are holding the last Democratic nominating contests before the party's July convention. Clinton needs a win in heavily Democratic California to begin unifying her party.
Though Sanders, a U.S. senator of Vermont, faces nearly insurmountable odds to become the Democratic nominee, he has invested heavily in California, where a win could pressure the party to adopt some of the populist policies that have driven his campaign.Polls show Sanders has chipped away at Clinton's lead in the state, where Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have built a vast network of supporters, including increasingly powerful Hispanic voters.Recent tracking polls showed Clinton having a 2 to 10 percentage point lead over Sanders in California.At a town hall in Los Angeles, Sanders promised to fight for comprehensive immigration reform and said that trade deals, over which he and Clinton have frequently sparred, funnel ""cheap corn"" into Mexico and ""drive small family farmers off their land.""
California is home to one-fourth of the immigrant population in the United States, at around 10 million people, and also home to one-fourth of the 11.3 million illegal immigrants in the country.Clinton, with 2,312 delegates, needs 71 more to reach the required 2,383 for the Democratic nomination. Sanders has 1,545. California, the most populous U.S. state, has 548 delegates who are awarded proportionately to the popular vote.The other states holding nominating contests on June 7 are Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota.
Clinton also slammed Trump on immigration at a rally in Oxnard, a city of about 200,000 located northwest of Los Angeles that is almost 75 percent Hispanic.Trump on Friday escalated his attacks on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over a lawsuit involving fraud at a failed Trump business, Trump University. Trump suggested that Curiel's Mexican-American heritage was influencing his opinion on the lawsuit. Curiel was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrants.""This is not just another outlandish insulting comment from Donald Trump and it is not normal politics, this is something much, much more dangerous,"" Clinton said.""Judge Curiel is just as much of an American as I am and just as much of an American as Donald Trump is,"" Clinton said.The New York billionaire businessman has vowed to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and deport millions of undocumented immigrants.

By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton has opened up a double-digit lead over Republican rival Donald Trump, regaining ground after the New York billionaire briefly tied her last month, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday.The shift in support comes as Clinton steps up her attacks on the real estate mogul's policy positions, and as Trump fends off criticisms of his eponymous university and the pace at which he doled out money that he raised for U.S. veterans.Some 46 percent of likely voters said they supported Clinton, while 35 percent said they supported Trump, and another 19 percent said they would not support either, according to the survey of 1,421 people conducted between May 30 and June 3.Trump had briefly tied Clinton in support among likely U.S. voters in mid-May, raising expectations for a tight race between the two likely contenders in November's presidential election.

Trump has all but sealed the Republican nod after a string of big wins in state nominating contests forced his party rivals to drop out, while Clinton is still fending off a long-shot bid for the Democratic spot on the ballot by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Clinton is hoping to seal the nomination next week, when a slew of big states including New Jersey and California will hold primaries, allowing her to consolidate her party's support ahead of a general election matchup against Trump.
Clinton's polling surge comes as Trump is been harangued by criticisms over his Trump University, the target of a trio of lawsuits that claim it misled thousands of people who paid up to $35,000 for seminars to learn about Trump's investment strategies. Trump has defended the school and said he will relaunch it once the litigation ends.Trump this week also outlined the recipients of millions of dollars in donations he raised at an event in January for veterans' groups, in a bid to end speculation that he had not yet handed over all of the money.
On Thursday, Clinton used a foreign policy speech in California to paint Trump's policy platform as ""dangerously incoherent"" and cast her Republican rival as both a frightening and laughable figure.Trump responded by saying she lied about his positions and by ripping her record as secretary of state, which he says was marred her handling of government emails and the death of a U.S. ambassador in Libya.

By David Brunnstrom and Greg Torode
| SINGAPORE

SINGAPORE The United States stepped up pressure on China on Saturday to rein in its actions in the South China Sea, with top defense officials underlining Washington's military superiority and vowing to remain the main guarantor of Asian security for decades to come.Defense Secretary Ash Carter said the U.S. approach to the Asia-Pacific remained ""one of commitment, strength and inclusion"", but he also warned China against provocative behavior in the South China Sea.Any action by China to reclaim land in the Scarborough Shoal, an outcrop in the disputed sea, would have consequences, Carter said.""I hope that this development doesn't occur, because it will result in actions being taken by the both United States and ... by others in the region which would have the effect of not only increasing tensions but isolating China,"" Carter told the Shangri-La Dialogue, a regional security forum in Singapore.""The United States will remain the most powerful military and main underwriter of security in the region for decades to come - and there should be no doubt about that.""The South China Sea has become a flashpoint between the United States, which increased its focus on the Asia-Pacific under President Barack Obama's ""pivot"", and China, which is projecting ever greater economic, political and military power in the region.Carter however said he would welcome China's participation in a ""principled security network"" for Asia.""Forward thinking statesmen and leaders must ... come together to ensure a positive principled future,"" he said, adding that the network he envisaged could also help protect against ""Russia's worrying actions"" and the growing strategic impact of climate change.The deputy head of China's delegation to the forum said the United States should reduce its provocative exercises and patrols in the region and said any attempts to isolate China would fail.""This is a time of cooperation and common security,"" Rear Admiral Guan Youfei told reporters. ""The U.S. action to take sides is not agreed by many countries. We hope the U.S. will also listen to the other countries.""
REGIONAL WORRIES
Other Asian leaders said the situation in the South China Sea was viewed with concern across the region.""All countries in the region need to recognize that our shared prosperities and the enviable rate of growth that this region enjoys over past decades will be put at risk by aggressive behavior or actions by any one of us,"" Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar told the forum. Japanese Defence Minister Gen Nakatani said his country would help Southeast Asian nations build their security capabilities to deal with what he called unilateral, dangerous and coercive actions in the South China Sea.
""In the South China Sea, we have been witnessing large-scale and rapid land reclamation, building of outposts and utilization of them for military purposes,"" Nakatani said. ""No country can be an outsider of this issue.""A Chinese official responded by saying Japan should be careful ""not to interfere and stir up problems"" in the waterway, while China's foreign ministry also weighed in regarding the U.S. and Japanese comments.""Counties outside the region should stick to their promises and not make thoughtless remarks about issues of territorial sovereignty,"" the ministry said in a statement.Trillions of dollars of trade a year passes through the South China Sea, which is home to rich oil, gas and fishing resources. Besides China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have claims in the area, and rising tensions have been fuelling increasing security spending in the region.""The uncertainty of China's future trajectory is arguably the main driving concern about possible military competition now and in the future,"" Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said.
Carter said that for decades some critics had been predicting an impending U.S. withdrawal from the region, but this would not happen.""That's because this region, which is home to nearly half the world's population and nearly half the global economy,  remains the most consequential for America's own security and prosperity.""TRUMP COUNTER
In an apparent counter to ""America-first"" policies expounded by prospective Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, including suggestions that U.S. troops should be withdrawn from Asia, Carter stressed bipartisan support for continued engagement.The Shangri-La Dialogue is being held ahead of a significant ruling expected in coming weeks on a case filed by the Philippines in the International Court of Arbitration challenging China's South China Sea claims, which Beijing has vowed to ignore.The United States has been lobbying Asian and other countries to back the judges' statement that their ruling must be binding, a call echoed by Japan on Saturday.China has lobbied on the other side for support for its position that the court lacks jurisdiction in the case.

By Greg Torode
| SINGAPORE

SINGAPORE The recent lifting of the U.S. arms embargo against Vietnam boosted trust between the former enemies, but significant weapons purchases are some way off, a senior Vietnamese military official said on Saturday.Deputy Defence Minister Nguyen Chi Vinh told Reuters possible weapons buys were part of a long-planned strengthening of Vietnamese-U.S. relations across economic, political, cultural and security fronts.""We are not sure what we can buy from the U.S. or what we want to buy,"" Vinh said in some of the first public comments from a Vietnamese defense official since U.S. President Barack Obama lifted the embargo in Hanoi last month.""It is at a very, very first step, I should stress,"" he said.""The removal of the embargo is not just significant in terms of trade, but also in terms of improving high-level trust and confidence.""
An evolving military relationship between the United States and Vietnam is being closely watched across the region as Hanoi seeks to deter its giant neighbor China over its more asserted stance on claims in the disputed South China Sea.The United States is eyeing closer military relations with Hanoi as it seeks to expand its so-called strategic pivot back to Asia amid concern over China's rising power in the region.Vietnam has rapidly increased military spending over the last decade, relying on its Cold War-era patron Moscow for purchases of state-of-the-art submarines, jet fighters and advanced missile systems.  
U.S. weapons manufacturers are eager to tap a new market in Vietnam but regional security experts believe Hanoi will move only gradually in easing its dependence on Moscow. The relatively high cost of U.S. weapons is another factor but regional military sources believe Vietnam is keen to first acquire improved surveillance and communications equipment to help it keep a better watch on China.This could include maritime patrol aircraft.
Speaking privately, U.S. officials say Vietnam has yet to start detailed discussions with Washington about its specific needs and gaps in its capabilities, a factor which they believe reflects decades of habitual secrecy.Speaking on the sidelines of the Shangri-la Dialogue security summit in Singapore, Vinh did not detail Vietnam's first planned U.S. procurements but repeatedly stated Vietnam's military improvements were defensive.Vietnam, like China and Taiwan, claims all the Paracel and Spratlys archipelagos in the South China Sea and Hanoi officials say privately that rising tensions in the South China Sea have complicated otherwise solid relations with Beijing.

SINGAPORE Japanese Defence Minister Gen Nakatani said on Saturday that Japan and South Korea agreed to expand an emergency communication system between their defense ministries, including adding a new direct line between defense ministers.Tensions have been high in the region since early January when North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test. It has followed that with a satellite launch and tests of various missiles, most recently a failed launch on Tuesday.""What it means is that we will make use of phones for emergency communication, when security-related emergencies such as a missile launch occur, and communication and coordination between the defense authorities of the two countries are needed,"" Nakatani told reporters at the Shangri-La Dialogue, a regional security forum in Singapore.He said such emergency phone lines would be expanded to include a new direct link between the two countries' defense ministers. Nakatani said talks would continue on sharing and safeguarding sensitive information on Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs. 
Under the framework, South Korea would pass relevant information to the United States, with which Seoul already has a legally-binding pact to share and safeguard intelligence called General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA). The United States would then pass the information on to Japan.It would work similarly the other way around since the United States has also signed a GSOMIA with Japan. 
Some South Koreans have voiced concerns about signing a security pact with Japan, their one-time colonial ruler. Besides historical issues stemming from Japan's annexation of the Korean peninsula that ended in 1945, ties have been chilled by a long-running territorial dispute over a group of tiny islets.

By David Lawder
| SEOUL

SEOUL U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said on Friday China would see ""very bad consequences"" for its economy and bilateral U.S. relations if it backs away from its stated goals to open its markets and rebalance its economy toward consumer-led growth.Lew, in an interview with Reuters in Seoul, said he would ""keep the pressure"" on Chinese officials during talks in Beijing next week to stick to their reform commitments and execute pledges to reduce excess industrial capacity that is distorting world markets.China faces diminished economic prospects in the medium and long term if it fails to continue its reforms, Lew said.""Frankly, if China takes a time-out or a step back on the reform agenda, that will have very bad consequences for China's economy and it will flow over and not be good in terms of our bilateral economic relations,"" Lew said.The U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue meetings on June 6-7 in Beijing come at a time of increasing trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.The U.S. Commerce Department has recently imposed steep anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on a wide-range of Chinese steel products, while U.S. business groups have complained about new Chinese regulations they say favor local firms.Meanwhile, the Chinese yuan is plumbing five-year lows against the dollar, raising concerns about the potential for another devaluation as the Federal Reserve prepares to resume interest rate increases after pausing for the past few months.
Lew said China had largely been keeping its G20 commitments to avoid competitive currency devaluations, adding that its action in recent months to spend reserves to support the yuan, also known as the renminbi or RMB, have been consistent with those commitments.  ""China's intervention in the last year has not been to devalue but it's been largely to support the RMB,"" Lew said. ""I think the test of whether China's moved decisively in an orderly way to a more market-oriented exchange rate is whether they're willing to tolerate movement in both directions.""Likewise, Lew said South Korea also needed to resist temptations to intervene in currency markets when there is upward pressure on the won. He said Seoul had refrained from active interventions for the past six to nine months.
""We have made it clear that we've recognized that. But we've also said that that has to be a durable policy. It has to be a policy that can withstand pressure when markets are going in both directions,"" he said.He said South Korea's interest in joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade bloc, assuming the deal is ratified,  would provide an incentive to improve its exchange rate policy. A currency side-agreement to the TPP would require transparency in interventions and commitments to avoid interventions to gain trade advantages.The U.S.-China economic and foreign policy talks in Beijing will also provide a forum to air U.S. business groups' concerns about regulations in China that they say favor domestic firms.For example, foreign insurers have raised concerns about new cyber security regulations that require ""secure and controllable"" information technology.
""Whether it's an anti-monopoly law, or a national security law, if it's being either designed or implemented in a way that's designed to create undue burdens on foreign competition, that's problematic,"" Lew said.Lew said it was important for the next U.S. president to continue the Strategic and Economic Dialogue because otherwise such disputes may not be discussed on a bilateral basis.At a separate meeting on Friday with South Korean Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho, Lew said that coordinated global action was needed to increase pressure on North Korea to drop its pursuit of nuclear weapons.A senior Treasury official said that this would require additional actions by China to adhere to new sanctions aimed at cutting off North Korea from the international financial system until it changes its behavior.

By Julia Love
| REDDING, Calif.

REDDING, Calif. Presumptive Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump on Friday denounced protesters in California as ""thugs"" a day after another demonstration outside one of his political rallies turned violent ahead of the state's presidential primary.Demonstrators traded blows on Thursday evening in the street outside the San Jose Convention Center, videos posted to Twitter and online by media showed. Hundreds of protesters waved Mexican flags, chanted anti-Trump slogans and burned Trump hats and at least one U.S. flag.Speaking before a packed crowd in the northern California city of Redding on Friday, Trump described the previous night's rally as ""a love fest inside. No problems whatsoever."" But then his supporters ""walked out and they got accosted by a bunch of thugs,"" he said.The protesters, many angry over Trump's rhetoric against illegal immigration, have gathered at Trump rallies for months. Trump, now the Republican Party's likely presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election, canceled a rally in Chicago in March after clashes broke out between his supporters and protesters.The San Jose Police Department reported 300 to 400 protesters had gathered outside the Trump rally on Thursday, where police formed lines to protect attendants exiting the convention center.A number of the skirmishes occurred beyond police lines on nearby streets and at a parking garage, a Reuters photographer said. One sergeant suffered minor injuries after a protester struck him with a metal object. Police reported four arrests.Over 250 officers staffed the ""all-hands on deck event,"" said San Jose Police Chief Eddie Garcia.""In hindsight, we'd say that wasn't enough,"" said Garcia. For future events of that scope, ""we would need more officers with an absolute, number one goal of keeping both parties separate as much as we can.""
San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo, a Democrat, told the Associated Press that Trump needs to take responsibility for his supporters' conduct at the rallies.But Trump, speaking in Redding on Friday, made light of the mayor's concerns.""You know what I say when we have a protestor, which isn't very often, I say, 'Be very gentle, please don't hurt him ... If he punches you in the face, smile,'"" Trump said.Violence has peppered Trump's recent rallies in New Mexico and California, the U.S. state with the largest immigrant population, in advance of primary elections there on Tuesday.The latest violence followed Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton's scorching critique of Trump in a speech on Thursday in which she derided the real estate developer as a dangerous man with an angry, fearful world view.
Clinton told CNN on Friday that Trump had set a ""low bar"" regarding violence at political events. ""Now is it a surprise that people who don't like him are stepping over that bar? I don't think it is,"" Clinton said.But Friday afternoon's rally was peaceful as supporters from Redding and neighboring towns gathered as early as 8 a.m. local time (1500 GMT) to catch a glimpse of the candidate, many wearing hats emblazoned with Trump's signature slogan: ""Make America Great Again.""Despite the unrest in San Jose, attendees said they felt at ease at Friday's event.""We're both retired law enforcement,"" Heather Jimenez, a 45-year-old Cottonwood resident, said of herself and her husband. ""No worries.""
Although no formal protests broke out in Redding, the event attracted some who disapprove of Trump, but wanted to witness his high-flying campaign style in person.""We've been hearing his nonsense,"" said Rachel Ochoa, a 57-year-old Redding resident who teaches English as a second language. ""All we hear is him attacking the opponents and others.""Trump has accused Mexico of sending drug dealers and rapists across the U.S. border and has promised to build a wall between the two neighboring countries and make Mexico pay for it.""We're gonna build that wall, folks,"" Trump said on Friday as the crowd chanted its support.Trump also lamented the loss of American jobs to other countries, a key theme in his campaign. The message resonated in Redding, which residents say has been hit hard by the economic downturn.""We've got a lot of people here out of work,"" said Joyce Tausch, a 78-year-old retiree who lives in Redding. ""Trump is gonna do things for us.""

MIAMI President Barack Obama warned Democrats on Friday that they need to work hard to defeat likely Republican nominee Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election but must avoid violence like that at a rally in California this week.""Strange things can happen in an election like this if we're not working hard, if we're not engaged, if we're not participating,"" Obama told donors at a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee.""I want us to run scared the whole time,"" he said.Obama decried the clashes between supporters of likely Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and protesters on Thursday at a rally in San Jose, California.
""We saw in San Jose these protesters starting to pelt stuff at Trump supporters; that's not what our democracy's about,"" Obama said.""There's no room for violence. There's no room for shouting. There's no room for a politics that fails to at least listen to the other side, even if you vehemently disagree,"" he said.Obama spoke to about 90 people who paid $10,000 to $30,000 for the dinner at the home of Robert Rubenstein, a personal injury lawyer.
He noted the ""constant"" television coverage of Trump, saying ""celebrity and fame is such a driver in this culture.""Obama said Republicans have ""no coherent economic theory.""
""Rather it is feeding resentments and looking for a 'they' to blame for whatever frustrations people understandably feel at any given point in time,"" he said.""Being able to say it's immigrants or it's gays or it's somebody that is taking something away from you - that's the essence of the message that the Republican nominee is delivering,"" he said.

8	8	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-idUSKCN0YP26B	Trump seizes on U.S. jobs report to target Democratic economic policies	"


By Amanda Becker and Emily Stephenson

WASHINGTON - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said a U.S. jobs report on Friday that showed the weakest hiring in more than five years proved that Democratic economic policies are pushing the country in the wrong direction.The report gave Trump his biggest opening yet to target Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on the economy, after months of mostly solid economic indicators.""It's going the wrong way folks. They've been kidding themselves, they're playing games. It's going the wrong way,"" Trump told a rally in Redding, California.Clinton, the front-runner to be the Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 election, has credited President Barack Obama for reviving the U.S. economy after the 2008 recession but has also said that the recovery is not over.In a CNN interview, Clinton acknowledged the figures were ""disappointing to anybody.""""I think President Obama inherited a terrible situation and I've said that repeatedly over the past year and we've come a long way out of the ditch we were dropped into by failed Republican policies,"" Clinton told CNN's Jake Tapper.The unemployment rate in May fell three-tenths of a percentage point to 4.7 percent, the lowest level since November 2007, but that was in part due to people dropping out of the labor force. Overall, nonfarm payrolls increased by only 38,000 jobs in May. If disappointing jobs reports continue, Trump could use Clinton's pledge to build on Obama's work against her to woo working-class voters in states such as Ohio. The state has lost well-paying manufacturing jobs and is also a key presidential battleground - closely competitive because it does not lean heavily Republican or Democratic.
CLINTON LEADS IN POLL
Clinton, a former secretary of state, is likely to finally clinch the Democratic nomination over challenger Bernie Sanders on Tuesday when six states hold nominating contests. One is California, the most populous U.S. state, with the most Democratic delegates of any other state and where both candidates have been campaigning heavily.In a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday, some 46 percent of likely voters said they supported Clinton, while 35 percent said they supported Trump, and another 19 percent said they would not support either. The survey of 1,421 people was conducted between May 30 and June 3.
Trump, a real estate developer, has already sewn up the Republican nomination. In the general election campaign, job creation plans are expected to be a priority, particularly in states that have been hit hard by manufacturing-sector job losses. Trump has promised to toss out international trade deals to revive U.S. manufacturing and sweep away a slew of environmental regulations to bolster the ailing energy sector. Job creation in the manufacturing and construction sectors fell sharply in May, according to Friday's jobs report. Trump has already begun working economic numbers into his stump speeches. He has said he could put 15 states that have voted for Democratic presidents in recent elections in play, including Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, which have all lost manufacturing-sector jobs.
Peter Morici, a conservative economist and professor in the business school at the University of Maryland, said the poor jobs numbers reflected trends that have driven voter frustration and fueled the populist campaigns of both Trump and Sanders. He said Trump needed to add detail to his economic policies, such as detailing changes to social programs like Medicaid, which provides healthcare for the poor. ""We can't just turn around and cut income taxes without doing something about those things,"" Morici said.Republican strategists agreed that Friday's jobs report created an opportunity for Trump to differentiate his policies from Obama's or Clinton's.""It allows Donald Trump to tout how he would do things differently as president and focus on some of the job-creation plans that he has,"" Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said, adding it would also allow Trump to talk about his record as a businessman.    Trump has been fleshing out his foreign policy ideas and has released a tax plan, but he has been light on other details, such as how he would oversee the U.S. financial system.

9	9	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-idUSKCN0YP2ND	Trump defends attacks on Mexican-American U.S. federal judge	"


By Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump defended his attacks on a Mexican-American judge on Friday, resisting pressure from top Republicans to moderate his tone out of concern he is hurting his chances to win the White House.Trump's bomb-throwing rhetoric helped him defeat 16 Republican rivals for the party's nomination for the Nov. 8 election. But facing a tough fight with expected Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, many Republicans want him to present a more disciplined image.Feeling confident his method has been a winner, Trump so far has waved off some of the advice from Republicans who support him but want less loose talk.In a CNN interview, Trump escalated his attacks on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, the son of Mexican immigrants who is the presiding judge in lawsuits involving fraud allegations against Trump University, the New York businessman's defunct real estate training school.Trump suggested Curiel's Mexican heritage was influencing the judge's opinion about the case because Trump has campaigned on a platform of building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico to stop illegal immigration.""He's proud of his heritage,"" Trump said.""He's a Mexican. We're building a wall between here and Mexico. The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can't even believe. This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment,"" Trump said. The judge a week ago unsealed documents related to the case.Comments from the two top elected U.S. Republicans, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, reflected continued worries among establishment Republicans about Trump.
'OUT OF LEFT FIELD'
Ryan, who endorsed Trump on Thursday, said the comments from Trump about the judge were ""out of left field.""""He clearly says and does things I don't agree with. And I've had to speak up ... (from) time to time when that has occurred. And I'll continue to do that if that's necessary. I hope it's not,"" Ryan told a Milwaukee radio station.McConnell, speaking on MSNBC, raised concerns about Trump's criticism of New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez, a rising star in the Republican Party who can appeal to Hispanic voters. After attacking her record last week, Trump on Thursday moderated his tone and said he would like her endorsement.
""We ought to be trying to unify, he ought to be trying to unify the party behind him,"" McConnell said of Trump. ""Most of us are committed to supporting him and trying to bring the party together, and I think he needs to play his role on all of that as well."" Trump received 32 percent support from Latino voters in an NBC News/Survey Monkey poll this week, a respectable number given his critical comments throughout the campaign about illegal immigrants, most of whom come from Mexico and other Latin American countries.But the specter of Trump as the nominee has worried some Hispanic Republicans.This week, Ruth Guerra, who is a Mexican-American, resigned as the Republican National Committee's chief of Hispanic media relations. A source familiar with her departure said she was not comfortable with Trump as the nominee.
More broadly, Reince Preibus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, has been trying to persuade Trump to moderate his tone as a way to heal fissures in the party, at a time when Trump will need to rely on deep-pocketed Republican loyalists to finance a $1 billion campaign.""He needs one thing and one thing only: discipline,"" said a senior party official, speaking on condition of anonymity.But if a Trump rally in Redding, California, was any indication, the candidate feels his method is working.""Temperament is a very important word,"" Trump said, referring to Clinton's charge that he is temperamentally unfit for the White House. ""We need toughness in tone. We need toughness in temperament.""Stung by attacks on him from Clinton on Thursday, Trump dredged up scandals from the 1990s to hit her and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, saying they are dishonest. He cited Bill Clinton's affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.""First of all, she's always got problems: Whitewater (a controversial real estate deal), impeachment, lies. He 'didn't have sex with that woman,'"" Trump said. ""These are lying people. We don't need, folks, another four years of the Clintons.""
