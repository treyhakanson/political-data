By Ann Saphir and Lindsay Dunsmuir
| SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON

SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON Donald Trump's rise to de-facto Republican nominee for president poses an unusually high level of uncertainty for investors and businesses, potentially weighing on the economy and the Federal Reserve's plan to raise interest rates this year.Uncertainty is always present in elections and the Fed has hiked rates during past campaign seasons. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1rD6A1u)But the possibility of the firebrand New York real estate mogul occupying the White House presents a step up in risk because of the unconventional policies he has proposed and a lack of detail on how they will be achieved, economists say.Promising to ""make America great again"", Trump has raised fears of a trade war by saying he would slap steep tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports. He has also vowed to deport all 11 million undocumented migrants in the United States, and suggested, though later retracted, a partial default on U.S. debt.Fed officials say they avoid discussion of domestic politics at rate-setting meetings. Transcripts from previous election-year policy discussions show that political uncertainty is a factor in their thinking, though there is no clear pattern of a loosening or tightening bias in the run-up to elections.In recent comments, some Fed officials have acknowledged that campaign rhetoric could spill over into the economy.""If consumers, because of political rhetoric, are slowing their spending or just pausing a little bit, or capex is slowing down...that I've got to take into account,"" Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan told Reuters last Thursday. Asked his view of Trump's policy proposals, he said, ""If I have one, you'll never know what that is. I will never allow that to seep into my work."" Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said that it was fair to say the election ""could be a factor in this year's economy.""The Fed kept rates on hold at 0.25-0.5 percent last month and signaled it was in no rush to raise them again soon, citing slowing economic activity despite an improved labor market. Fed policymakers in March forecast two rate hikes this year after raising them last December for the first time in nearly a decade.A Reuters poll of economists released on Thursday showed they have pushed back their expectations for the Fed to raise interest rates again to September from June.
FED KEEPS EYE ON UNCERTAINTY
Fed Chair Janet Yellen and other Fed policymakers have often cited uncertainty over the economic, financial and policy outlook as a factor in their interest-rate decisions. The VIX measure of stock-market volatility is one approach to measuring uncertainty; querying influential business owners is another. The exact mix of measures the Fed uses is not known.Stanford University professor Nick Bloom's economic policy uncertainty index, which he presented to Yellen and economists at recently as April last year, is another approach that the Fed considers.The index analyzes newspaper coverage of policy-related economic uncertainty and divergence between economic forecasters' predictions on the U.S. outlook among other factors.  ""When uncertainty is high, firms put on pause hiring and investment decisions,"" Bloom said in an interview. ""If Trump looks like a serious contender and is still making 'Mexican Wall' and 'Trade Rape' comments we will have the mother of all policy uncertainty spikes running up to the election."" Trump has said he would build a wall on the Mexico-U.S. border and accused China of ""raping"" the U.S. with unfair trade policies. 
A rise in the index, Bloom said, would foreshadow declines in production, investment, and employment. Policymakers pay close attention to financial market volatility as well as economic data. The Fed delayed an expected hike last September after China's sharp economic slowdown caused stock market drops and a tightening in financial conditions.A strong Trump candidacy could similarly upset markets, economists say. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday showed Trump running nearly even with Democrat Hillary Clinton among likely U.S. voters, a dramatic turnaround since he became his party's presumptive nominee.Traders see a 36.5 percent chance of a Republican taking the presidency, according to futures prices on the Iowa Electronic Market. ""If Trump gains in the polls and the market reacts poorly, that (market turmoil) would be a good argument for the Fed to stay on hold,"" said Cornerstone Macro economist Roberto Perli, a former Fed board staffer.China and Mexico are the second and third largest trading partners of the United States, respectively.
""The trade stuff is anti-growth and harmful to the U.S. outlook,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of conservative think tank the American Action Forum and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.""He's an utterly unpredictable political element at this point,"" added Holtz-Eakin, who was also chief economic policy adviser to Senator John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. Trump, who says his policies will boost U.S. jobs and business interests, has said he likes low rates, but has also said he would replace Yellen when her term expires in 2018 if he wins the presidency.  So far there's little indication Bloom's uncertainty index is about to spike. It fell to a reading of 98.39 in April, just above where it was in November ahead of the Fed's well-telegraphed rate hike. Other readings of uncertainty, like the VIX, look similarly benign. Voters go to the polls on Nov. 8.Historically, Bloom's index jumps just ahead of tight presidential ballots, as well as during times of other policy uncertainty, such as the U.S. debt ceiling debate in 2011. A surge of 90 points in the index could presage a one percent decline in production and declines in employment and investment of about a half a percent each, based on Bloom's models. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Graphic showing past Fed rate moves in election years    tmsnrt.rs/1rD6A1u)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> (Reporting by Ann Saphir and Lindsay Dunsmuir; Editing by David Chance and Stuart Grudgings)"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

GENEVA People travelling to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro should avoid visiting impoverished and overcrowded urban areas to prevent catching the mosquito-borne Zika virus, which has been linked to birth defects, the World Health Organization said on Thursday.Athletes and visitors should also consult a health worker before travelling, use insect repellent and clothing on as much of their body as possible, and practice safe sex or abstain during their stay and for at least four weeks after their return, it said.
They should also choose air-conditioned accommodation. Pregnant women should avoid travelling to areas with Zika transmission, including Rio de Janeiro, the WHO said.

By Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Senate negotiators on Wednesday tried to reach a deal to provide more than $1 billion to battle the Zika virus that is feared will creep north into the United States with the onset of warmer weather, which breeds mosquitoes that could carry the disease.Senior Senate Democratic aides said details were still being worked out, but votes could come by next week on whether to approve the new money.In February, President Barack Obama requested $1.9 billion in emergency funds, but Republicans balked, with some arguing that $1.1 billion is more in line with what is needed. Many Republicans also want any Zika funds to be offset with spending cuts elsewhere.These are among the details that still have to be worked out, according to aides.
Republican Senator Roy Blunt from Missouri and Democratic Senator Patty Murray from Washington, the two senior senators on an appropriations panel that oversees healthcare spending, have been trying to hammer out a deal.An aide to Murray said in a statement: ""Senator Murray is having conversations with Chairman Blunt and others about the path forward on emergency funding to respond to Zika.""The aide said Murray still supports Obama's $1.9 billion request.
Amid congressional inaction, the Obama administration shifted $589 million to help federal agencies prepare for Zika. Most of that money came from a fund to fight the Ebola virus and will have to be replenished, according to officials.Senator Marco Rubio, however, is one Republican pushing for both immediate, emergency funding and longer-term money to be made available starting on Oct. 1 to battle the disease that can cause severe brain deformities in babies born of infected mothers and other illnesses.
""This is going to be an ongoing issue beyond this year,"" Rubio said, adding, ""We need to jump on it now.""There are fears that Rubio's home state of Florida could be the first place in the continental United States to get hit hard by Zika because of its tropical climate.""For the first time, I've seen high-level conversations about a way forward here in the Senate and that's a positive development,"" Rubio said in a brief hallway interview with Reuters.Republicans in the House of Representatives are still deeply divided over new funding for Zika, according to two senior aides."

 (This version of the May 11 story, corrects figure in second paragraph to 100.)WASHINGTON A senior U.S. Republican filed legislation on Wednesday seeking to rein in the White House's National Security Council, saying it has grown too large and seeks to play too big a role in foreign policy.Representative Mac Thornberry said his measure would increase oversight of the NSC, capping it at 100 people or allowing it to be larger but subjecting the National Security adviser to confirmation by the Senate.Thornberry estimated the NSC currently has 400 staff.""All of President (Barack) Obama's former Defense Secretaries have complained about micromanagement by the NSC,"" Thornberry, chairman of the powerful House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. ""I have personally heard from troops on the frontlines who have received intimidating calls from junior White House staffers.
""Now we hear reports of NSC staffers running misinformation campaigns targeted at Congress and the press,"" Thornberry said. He was referring to a recent New York Times profile in which a deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, discussed ways the administration had communicated about last year's Iran nuclear deal to the Washington press corps.Administration officials have dismissed proposals like Thornberry's as political ploys.
Ned Price, a spokesman for the NSC, commented that the White House has already taken steps to trim staff and streamline procedures.Thornberry introduced his legislation as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, a must-pass annual defense bill.
To become law, a version of the NDAA including Thornberry's amendment would have to pass both the House and Senate and be signed into law by Obama. (Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Additional reporting by Roberta Rampton; Editing by Leslie Adler)"	['Thornberry', 'Obama']	[]

BERLIN The European Union would not simply carry on as before should Britain vote to leave the bloc, Germany's foreign minister said on Thursday, pointing to Northern Ireland as one potential trouble spot.Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he hoped Britain would vote to stay in the 28-member bloc in a referendum on June 23.""Should the British decide otherwise, then the European Union won't just carry on as 28 minus one,"" Steinmeier told a conference on Europe in his ministry.As an example of one area where old troubles could flare up, he pointed to Northern Ireland and its border with EU member Ireland, which is open and where the situation is largely calm.
""At the moment that the United Kingdom leaves (the EU), we have a border again between Ireland and Northern Ireland. That has at least the potential to allow completely calmed conflicts to flare up again,"" Steinmeier said.
A 1998 peace deal, brokered after more than 3,600 had died, has largely ended the conflict that pitted mostly Catholics, who wanted a united Ireland, against Unionists, mostly Protestants, who wanted it to remain part of the United Kingdom.
