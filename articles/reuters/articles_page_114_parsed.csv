By Maurice Tamman and Chris Kahn

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has pulled into an effective tie with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, erasing a substantial deficit as he consolidated support among his party's likely voters in recent weeks, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll released Friday.The poll showed 40 percent of likely voters supporting Trump and 39 percent backing Clinton for the week of Aug. 26 to Sept. 1. Clinton's support has dropped steadily in the weekly tracking poll since Aug. 25, eliminating what had been a eight-point lead for her.Trump's gains came as Republican support for their party's candidate jumped by six percentage points over the past two weeks, to about 78 percent. That is still below the 85 percent support Republican nominee Mitt Romney enjoyed in the summer of 2012, but the improvement helps explain Trump's rise in the poll.The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English in all 50 states. The latest poll surveyed 1,804 likely voters over the course of the week; it had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of three percent.Different polls have produced widely different results over the course of the campaign. In part that's because some, like Reuters/Ipsos, have attempted to measure the preferences of who's likely to vote, while others have surveyed the larger pool of all registered voters. And even those that survey likely voters have different ways of estimating who is likely to cast a ballot. Polling aggregators, which calculate averages of major polls, have shown that Clinton's lead has been shrinking for the past few weeks. Those averages put her advantage over Trump at between three and six percentage points. Some of the more recent individual polls, however, have the race even tighter.
Voters don't elect the American president directly, of course, but through the Electoral College, an assembly representing each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia based on the number of legislators they have in Congress. As of last Friday, the separate Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation polling project estimated Clinton was on track to win the Electoral College, by about 332 votes to 206. Those numbers were scheduled to be updated later Friday.In recent weeks, Clinton has come under renewed criticism over her handling of classified information while serving as U.S. secretary of state, and her family's charitable foundation has come under fresh scrutiny for the donations it accepted while Clinton served in the Obama administration. Meanwhile, Clinton hasn't been campaigning as actively as Trump.TRUMP'S BUMP

Trump, meanwhile, has reshuffled his campaign leadership and sought to broaden his appeal to moderate Republicans and minorities. He recently suggested that he would be a better president than Clinton for African Americans, and has taken steps, including a meeting this week with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, to reach out to immigrants. It remains to be seen whether those efforts will click.Clinton has led Trump through most of the campaign for the November election, though neither candidate appears to have inspired America. In the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, more than 20 percent of likely voters opted for a choice other than the two major nominees, whether an alternative candidate, ""would not vote"" or ""unsure."" That figure is significantly higher than the 10 percent to 14 percent of respondents who answered similarly at this point in the 2012 campaign. Both President Barack Obama and Republican rival Mitt Romney enjoyed substantially stronger support at this point in the summer of 2012 than either Trump or Clinton does now.
And while Trump has consolidated his support among Republicans, likely voters are expressing an increasingly sour view of Clinton: The share of likely voters with an unfavorable view of the former secretary of state has grown to 57 percent, compared with Trump's 54 percent, her worst showing on that metric in a month.Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said he remains convinced Clinton is ahead, somewhere in the range seen among the polling aggregators.""There has been a closing that's completely natural,"" Sabato said. ""Every four years, you have two national party conventions that produce a bounce of varying sizes. Clinton got a substantial bounce this year that lasted for a full month. It's usually gone around Labor Day, and by then we'll be where we should be, which is right around four to five points"" for Clinton.In a separate question in the Reuters/Ipsos poll that included alternative-party candidates, Clinton and Trump were tied at 39 percent. Seven percent supported Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, and two percent supported Jill Stein of the Green Party. (Edited by Michael Williams)"	['Clinton', 'Romney', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

By Hilary Russ
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK New Jersey Governor Christie said on Friday the state would begin taxing income earned by people who work in New Jersey but live in Pennsylvania, ending a long-standing arrangement with the neighboring state.Pulling out of the nearly 40-year old ""reciprocity"" agreement would allow New Jersey to raise more revenue starting Jan. 1.Christie, a close ally of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, said in a statement that he was forced to act because the Democrat-controlled legislature created a $250 million budget hole in June by relying on public employee health insurance cuts they have not yet made.If lawmakers come back next week and cut health costs, Christie could consider ""revising"" his termination of the reciprocal tax pact.
""I will not raise state taxes, cut property tax relief, reduce aid to education or our hospitals, or reduce the state's record pension payment to cover for this blunder by the legislature,"" Christie said. Jeff Sheridan, press secretary to Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, said Christie ""erred significantly in his decision to unnecessarily punish 125,000 Pennsylvanians and cost the commonwealth $5 million annually.""He said Wolf, a Democrat, was hopeful Christie would change his mind. However, Christie seems committed to making Pennsylvania ""suffer the consequences of his failure to enact a responsible budget in a bipartisan way,"" Sheridan said.
Pennsylvanians pay a flat 3.07 percent income tax rate with no personal exemptions. New Jerseyans pay higher rates the more they make, with progressive rates increasing from 1.4 percent to 8.97 percent.The reciprocal agreement is advantageous for high-income Pennsylvania residents who work in New Jersey, because they pay their state's lower tax rate. It is also good for low-income New Jerseyans who work across the border because of New Jersey's progressive tax system.
New Jersey Senate President Steve Sweeney said in a statement that ending the scheme is ""the wrong decision for our state"" and that more than 100,000 New Jersey residents will pay almost $1,000 per year in additional income tax. ""The burden falls completely on working families in New Jersey, especially those in South Jersey who work in Philadelphia, and will have a very real impact on their quality of life,"" he said.

By Dave Graham
| MEXICO CITY

MEXICO CITY A Mexican senator is proposing legislation to empower the government to retaliate if a U.S. administration led by Donald Trump inflicts expropriations or economic losses on his country to make it pay for a border wall.Republican presidential nominee Trump has vowed to have Mexico fund the planned wall to keep out illegal immigrants if he is elected, and threatened to fund it by blocking remittances sent home by Mexicans living in the United States.Armando Rios Piter, an opposition senator for the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), will next week present the initiative he hopes will protect Mexicans, and highlight the risks of targeting them economically.The plan offers a taste of the kind of tit-for-tat measures that could gain traction between the two heavily-integrated economies if Trump wins the presidency at the Nov. 8 election.In a preliminary summary of the proposal, which also foresees giving the Senate the power to disavow international treaties when the interests of Mexico or its companies are threatened by other signatories, it states:
""In cases where the property/assets of (our) fellow citizens or companies are affected by a foreign government, as Donald Trump has threatened, the Mexican government should proportionally expropriate assets and properties of foreigners from that country on our territory.""Total remittances to Mexico from abroad - most of which come from the United States - were worth nearly $25 billion last year, according to the central bank. Bilateral trade between the two nations is worth about half a trillion dollars a year.Trump has also threatened to tear up a trade deal with Mexico if it is not recast in the United States' favor. He met President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico City this week, sparking fierce criticism in Mexico of the government for hosting him.
Afterwards, Trump repeated his pledge to make Mexico foot the bill for the wall. Mexico says it will not pay.It is yet to be established how such expropriations could work, nor is it clear what chance the bill could have of passing. The PRD and other leftist parties hold less than a quarter of the 128 seats in Mexico's Senate.
Rios Piter said his aim was to counter threats by Trump to target Mexicans in the United States and to stress that the economic welfare of both nations is at stake.""At a time like this, it's vital for us to understand why this relationship benefits both. We're neighbors, we're friends, we're partners,"" he said. ""He's putting (that) at risk.""The initiative also seeks to protect Mexico against unilateral changes to the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which Trump has threatened to ditch.

By Amanda Becker and Ransdell Pierson
| WASHINGTON/NEW YORK

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Hillary Clinton said on Friday that if elected to the White House she would create an oversight panel to protect U.S. consumers from large price hikes on long-available, lifesaving drugs and to import alternative treatments if necessary, adding to her pledges to rein in overall drug prices.Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, would seek to give the panel an ""aggressive new set of enforcement tools,"" including the ability to levy fines and impose penalties on manufacturers when there has been an ""unjustified, outlier price increase"" on a long-available or generic drug, her campaign said.""Over the past year, we've seen far too many examples of drug companies raising prices excessively for long-standing, life-saving treatments with little or no new innovation or R&D,"" Clinton said in a statement.If Clinton defeats Republican rival Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election, she would need the support of the U.S. Congress to implement key measures of her proposal, which follows a broader plan to rein in drug prices that she announced a year ago.Even though her latest plan would likely affect a small number of companies, it could be difficult to get Republican lawmakers on board, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said, adding that a ""Republican Congress would push back hard on this.""Clinton's campaign cited Turing Pharmaceuticals LLC's raising the price of its AIDS drug Daraprim (pyrimethamine) and Mylan NV's repeated steep price increases on EpiPen for severe allergy sufferers as ""troubling"" examples of price hikes that have attracted bipartisan congressional scrutiny.Conover said Clinton's plan to address unjustified price hikes is less of a concern to the drug industry than her pledge last year to reduce drug prices overall.Drugmakers have said that lowering or limiting drug prices would hamper their ability to invest in research and lead to fewer new therapies.The ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large U.S. and European drugmakers rose 0.30 percent on Friday, in line with gains for the broad stock market. Shares of Mylan fell 4.6 percent to $40.00 on the Nasdaq.
The Nasdaq biotech index slipped 0.40 percent. The decline was slight compared to the more than 4.7 percent drop in the index seen on Sept. 21, 2015, when Clinton blasted ""price gouging"" in the specialty drug market on Twitter, responding to reports that Turing had acquired Daraprim, an older antibiotic, and then hiked its price by 5,000 percent. Soon afterward, Clinton presented a general plan to lower prescription drug costs, including allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and demand higher rebates for prescription drugs. Her plan would also include caps on monthly and annual out-of-pocket costs for patients with chronic or serious health conditions. It aims to prohibit manufacturers from paying generic drugmakers to delay launching their cheaper products, and would eliminate corporate writeoffs for direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising.A ""BOLD IDEA""

Dr. Peter Bach, the director of a nonpartisan health policy research group at New York's Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said Clinton's announcement on Friday was a ""flag"" for drug manufacturers that her administration would notice and respond to steep price hikes.""It's a response to the broader industry phenomenon of generating added profits by raising the price of drugs for which there is no competition,"" Bach said, saying the campaign was focusing on a ""sub-category"" of manufacturers that had not invested heavily in developing a drug.Bach said he was contacted by the Clinton campaign about his work on drug pricing but had not advised the campaign in a formal capacity.The oversight panel would be made up of representatives from existing public health and consumer protection agencies who convene to examine the scope of a drug price increase, the manufacturer's production cost and the treatment's relative value to patients and public health, Clinton's campaign said.Terry Haines, head of political analysis for Evercore ISI, said Clinton's proposed panel had little hope of getting through Congress. 
But Clinton, if elected, might be able to achieve price reform via changes to Medicare's prescription drug benefit, known as Medicare Part D, if she works with Congress to reform the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, Haines said.In that event, Haines said shares of pharmaceutical and biotech companies could come ""under sustained headline risk in 2017 as ACA reforms are discussed.""        In cases where a price hike determined to be unjustified is accompanied by insufficient market competition, Clinton's administration would intervene to purchase alternative drugs from comparably regulated markets or assist manufacturers in bringing the product to market in the United States.Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, called it a ""bold idea"" to get the federal government ""involved in helping stabilizing some of these generic drug markets.""Until recently, there was a lengthy wait for generic drug approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Although the wait time has shortened, there is often not enough consistent demand for manufacturers to enter the U.S. market, Kesselheim said.""Having the government get involved as a long-term purchaser of these products creates a stockpile to stabilize the market,"" he said.Kesselheim has testified before Congress about high-cost generic and long-available drugs and spoke to Clinton's campaign about his research as it developed its proposals.

By Scott Malone
| BOSTON

BOSTON (Editor's note: This story contains language in the second paragraph that may offend readers)The president of Maine's state Senate on Friday said he would not pursue a special session to censure Governor Paul LePage for leaving a profanity-laden voicemail message for a lawmaker amid a dispute about the governor's comments on race and drug dealing.Senator Michael Thibodeau, who like LePage is a Republican, earlier in the week had said he was interested in a one-day special session to officially reprimand the two-term governor for calling a Democratic state legislator a ""little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker.""But on Friday he said he would not follow the lead of state House Speaker Mark Eves, who began polling lawmakers in his chamber as to whether they were ready to call a special session ""to take action regarding the Governor's conduct.""
""He is unfit to serve as Governor and must resign or be removed from office,"" Eves said of LePage in a statement on Friday.That query, Thibodeau said, went further than Senate Republicans were willing to go, adding that his party had been ready to vote for a one-day session to vote on an official censure of LePage, whose current term extends through 2018.""We're not interested in coming back for impeachment,"" Thibodeau told reporters.
The state House and Senate both adjourned in April and are not due to meet again until after the November elections.LePage has faced a flurry of criticism over the past week for saying that members of minority groups from out of state were responsible for the lion's share of the heroin trade in Maine. He drew further criticism after leaving a profane and widely circulated voicemail for a lawmaker that he believed had called him a racist.
Earlier in the week he mused during a 15-minute radio interview about the idea of not finishing out his term, only to come back a day later to say that he would not resign.Earlier this year a group of lawmakers started an effort to impeach him, contending the governor overstepped his authority by threatening to withhold funds from a nonprofit group that hired a political rival, but that effort collapsed before making it to the full House.Under Maine's constitution, Thibodeau would have been first in line to succeed LePage if he stepped down or was removed from office.

By Michelle Conlin and Grant Smith
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has run an unusually cheap campaign in part by not paying at least 10 top staffers, consultants and advisers, some of whom are no longer with the campaign, according to a review of federal campaign finance filings.   Those who have so far not been paid, the filings show, include recently departed campaign manager Paul Manafort, California state director Tim Clark, communications director Michael Caputo and a pair of senior aides who left the campaign in June to immediately go to work for a Trump Super PAC. The New York real estate magnate and his allies have touted his campaign's frugality, saying it is evidence of his management skills. His campaign's spending has totaled $89.5 million so far, about a third of what Democratic rival Hillary Clinton's campaign has spent.But not compensating top people in a presidential campaign is a departure from campaign finance norms. Many of the positions involved might typically come with six-figure annual paychecks in other campaigns.""It's unprecedented for a presidential campaign to rely so heavily on volunteers for top management positions,"" said Paul Ryan, an election lawyer with the campaign finance reform advocacy group Campaign Legal Center.The Trump campaign said the Reuters' reporting was ""sloppy at best"" but declined to elaborate.One of the 10 who were unpaid, Michael Caputo, told a Buffalo radio station in June after he resigned from the campaign, that he was not volunteering. Rather, he said he just had not gotten paid. Caputo confirmed to Reuters on Thursday that the Trump campaign has still not paid his invoices. In another instance, two high-level former Trump campaign advisers, former Chris Christie campaign manager Ken McKay and Manafort lobbying associate Laurance Gay, departed the Trump campaign in June and went to work for the Trump-backed Super PAC, Rebuilding America Now. In June, the Super PAC paid each of them $60,000, the filings show.  
Federal campaign law stipulates that people working for campaigns, who may possess strategic knowledge of a campaign or work as a campaign's agents, must wait for 120 days before going to work for a Super PAC, a political spending group that can accept unlimited sums of money from wealthy donors so long as it does not coordinate with a campaign. Through a spokesperson, McKay and Gay said they were volunteering for Trump and did not possess strategic information so the rule did not apply to them. LOW PAYROLL

Another example of free labor is Rick Gates, who was Manafort's deputy. According to two former high-level Trump staffers, Gates essentially functioned as the Trump campaign manager for more than two months, all while not collecting a paycheck. By contrast, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook earned roughly $10,000 in July, the same amount as President Barack Obama's campaign manager Jim Messina did in 2012. That same year, Republican nominee Mitt Romney's campaign manager, Matt Rhoades, was making nearly $7,000 bi-monthly.Others who, according to the FEC filings, have not been paid include finance chairman Steven Mnuchin, national political director Rick Wiley and senior adviser Barry Bennett, who were not available for comment. Nor were Manafort, Gates and Clark.Many campaigns have volunteers who work as low-level ground troops, knocking on voters' doors and passing out campaign buttons. There are instances in other campaigns of senior staff opting not to draw a paycheck. For example, John Podesta, a longtime adviser to Clinton who is now her campaign chairman, considers his role honorary and does not draw a salary.
What is unusual, however, is for a campaign to have such a large group of people in top positions who are unpaid. After Manafort resigned in August, Trump promoted his senior adviser and top pollster, Kellyanne Conway, to become his new campaign manager. Before then, Conway ran a Super PAC affiliated with Texas Senator and Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz. For work from June 2015 to June 2016, the Super PAC paid the firm she owns more than $700,000.She officially joined the Trump campaign July 1. But so far, according to campaign finance reports that detail spending through July 31, Conway has not been paid by the Trump campaign.She did not respond to a request for comment.

By Emily Stephenson and Mark Hosenball
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The Clinton Foundation on multiple occasions during Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state asked senior U.S. government officials to vet her husband's contacts with potentially controversial international figures, according to emails released by the State Department.The emails, reviewed by Reuters, were part of a batch of nearly 400 messages recently released by the State Department after requests from the conservative group Citizens United, a group that has long been critical of the Clintons.The exchanges show a top foreign policy adviser to the foundation sought guidance from the State Department on former President Bill Clinton's interactions with people including Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Russian government officials and business leaders, and Gulnara Karimova, the socialite daughter of Uzbekistan's late president.The emails offer a glimpse of the intricate relationship between a private charity with a broad global mission and the State Department under the leadership of a secretary who is married to a former president.Former government officials reached by Reuters said there was nothing inappropriate in the interactions of the foundation with the State Department over the potential meetings, some of which did not occur.The latest batch of emails likely represents only a partial view of all the exchanges between the State Department and the foundation. It is unclear how frequently the foundation sought advice from the State Department on meetings involving Bill Clinton.In one instance, the emails show Amitabh Desai, a foreign policy adviser to the foundation and to Bill Clinton, raised the possibility in 2009 of a meeting between Bill Clinton and Syrian President Assad. At the time, Assad wanted better ties with the West.""Would this be concerning for State?"" Desai wrote in an email alerting Hillary Clinton aide Jake Sullivan to the possible meeting.
""The Syrians expressed a keen interest in facilitating this,"" Desai said in an email a few days later.The Syria visit was proposed to be tacked onto a forum Bill Clinton was invited to attend in Israel in November 2009, according to the emails. The meeting never happened, according to Martin Indyk, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel who helped  to organize the trip.The State Department sometimes communicates with charities, such as about circumstances that might involve the safety of Americans or highly sensitive diplomatic situations, but it typically does not vet their contacts with foreign leaders to this extent. State Department spokesman Elizabeth Trudeau said officials occasionally provide talking points and briefings to ex-presidents.Much of Bill Clinton's communications with the State Department stemmed from an ethics agreement that was put in place when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009. The agreement was aimed at avoiding conflicts of interests stemming from contributions to the foundation and Bill Clinton's paid speeches and consulting. Trudeau said these were ""voluntary steps"" taken to avoid ""even the appearance of a conflict of interest.""Angel Urena, press secretary for Bill Clinton, said the requests for State Department input on potential meetings, talking points and other information ""was done in order to inform the administration of President Clinton's interactions with foreign governments and dignitaries, so that the administration could in turn offer advice or voice any concerns."" Urena said Bill Clinton had sought advice on his activities since he left office in 2001.
The Clinton Foundation referred questions to Urena. Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign declined to comment.CHARITY QUESTIONS LINGER
Clinton's campaign to win the Nov. 8 presidential election has been dogged by criticism of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, a global philanthropic organization.
The foundation has said it will stop accepting at least some foreign and corporate donations if Hillary Clinton becomes president and that Bill Clinton would resign from the foundation's board.In one previously unreported email exchange, Desai wrote to the State Department in May 2012 informing officials that Bill Clinton would travel to Monaco to raise money for the foundation at an event where he might cross paths with the elder daughter of the Uzbekistan president.Gulnara Karimova, a businesswoman and pop star, was described in a 2005 cable from a U.S. embassy official as the ""single most hated person in Uzbekistan"" because of her flamboyant lifestyle in an authoritarian country. She has since come under investigation in an international bribery scandal.Ahead of the event in Monaco, Desai wrote that the organizers had invited Karimova to be one of the event's sponsors ""apparently without our approval.""The Uzbekistan president's daughter ""will be listed in the program and will see (Bill Clinton),"" he said. ""Would (the U.S. government) have concerns? If so, we can go back to organizer and ask them to return her sponsorship and disinvite her, however I assume that would ruffle some feathers,"" Desai said.The emails released to Citizens United don't contain a reply to Desai's inquiry. However, a collection of photos from the Monaco event posted on the internet show Karimova attended it. They do not show any pictures of her with Bill Clinton.

By Jonathan Allen
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation will shut down its fundraising affiliates in Sweden and the United Kingdom if Hillary Clinton wins the U.S. presidency in November, a spokesman for the global charity said this week.The foundation has in recent weeks begun announcing planned new donor restrictions to allay criticism that wealthy supporters might be expecting special treatment from the U.S. government in return.Both the William J. Clinton Foundation UK in London and the Clinton Foundation Insamlingsstiftelse in Stockholm will close if Clinton becomes president because of their acceptance of foreign funding, Brian Cookstra, a spokesman for the Clinton Foundation in New York, said in one of a series of emails responding to questions from Reuters.Both organizations exist to receive donations overseas, neither have any employees, and they are overseen by board members of the main Clinton Foundation in the United States, their financial statements show.Some of the foundation's foreign outposts have drawn extra scrutiny because donors can give money anonymously. The foundation said last month it would no longer accept foreign funding for at least some of its work if Clinton is elected, although Donald Trump, Clinton's Republican rival for the presidency, continues to accuse Clinton of being corrupted by foreign donors. She has dismissed this as a political smear.
In order to become President Barack Obama's secretary of state in 2009, Clinton signed an ethics agreement promising to annually publish the names of all donors to her family's philanthropy, including foreign governments that have collectively given tens of millions of dollars. Clinton also promised that her charities would seek prior approval from the State Department's ethics office before accepting new donations from foreign governments.The charities have since conceded they did not keep these promises, blaming oversights. (reut.rs/2c7iqgk)The foundation's outpost in Stockholm has received nearly 270 million Swedish crowns, about $30 million, since it was established in 2011, while Clinton was still secretary of state. 
Most of this money was given by the Swedish Postcode Lottery and the Dutch Postcode Lottery, according to the Clinton Foundation Insamlingsstiftelse's website.About $6 million came from other donors that are not disclosed by the Clinton Foundation Insamlingsstiftelse. Cookstra said those donors were included in the donor list published on the main Clinton Foundation's website but declined to identify them or say why they were donating in Sweden rather than the United States.The foundation also declined to explain a discrepancy in donations in records from 2012. The Swedish Postcode Lottery Foundation said it donated 6.6 million crowns (about $1 million) that year, but the Clinton Foundation reported this amount as 19.7 million crowns (about $3 million).
Cookstra also declined to say whether the foundation has other fundraising arms set up in foreign countries besides the United Kingdom and Sweden.The British arm of the Clinton Foundation has raised at least $400,000 since 2007, according to records held by the British government's Charity Commission.The State Department says it has no record of being notified about the foundation's overseas outposts during Clinton's tenure.""The State Department was not responsible for monitoring or approving the organization and operation of the Clinton Foundation or its offshoots,"" Elizabeth Trudeau, a department spokeswoman, said in a statement. ""The Department reviewed all information submitted to it. You would need to ask the Foundation whether there were additional matters that it should have submitted for State Department review.""

WASHINGTON Journalists from NBC, ABC, CNN and Fox News will moderate the three scheduled debates between U.S. presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ahead of the Nov. 8 election, the nonpartisan group organizing the events said on Friday.NBC anchor Lester Holt will ask questions at the first debate on Sept. 26 in New York, while ABC global affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz and CNN anchor Anderson Cooper will co-moderate the Oct. 9 ""town meeting"" style debate in St. Louis, the Commission on Presidential Debates said. Fox News anchor Chris Wallace will moderate on Oct. 19 in Las Vegas, it said in a statement.CBS journalist Elaine Quijano will moderate the single vice presidential debate on Oct. 4 between Republican Indiana Governor Mike Pence and his Democratic rival, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, the commission said. C-SPAN's Steve Scully will be a back-up moderator for all four of the debates, it added.Trump, the Republican candidate, has said he will take part in the three debates but wants to see the conditions. Representatives for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday's announcement.
The New York businessman, who has never held elected office, has had repeated run-ins with the media since launching his campaign last year, charging networks like CNN with ""phony reporting,"" sparring with MSNBC hosts and insulting Fox News journalist Megyn Kelly. His campaign has also black-listed several reporters and news outlets.Clinton, the Democratic candidate, has said she will participate in all three debates as scheduled. Separately, NBC has said Trump and Clinton will participate in a ""commander-in-chief"" forum focused on military issues on Sept. 7 in New York, appearing separately.
On Friday, Trump's son Eric raised questions about ties between the anchor for that event, Matt Lauer, and the Clinton Foundation and said NBC and its cable offshoot MSNBC have been against his father.""Obviously, there's a lot of speculation because of his involvement with the foundation,"" Eric Trump told Fox News in an interview. ""I hope he'll be fair.""
Representatives for NBC said Lauer was not a member of the foundation and that he had interviewed former President Bill Clinton for the network's ""Today"" show, not on behalf of the foundation.Trump's reality television show, ""The Apprentice,"" debuted on NBC in 2004. NBC later cut other ties with the businessman, dropping his ""Miss USA"" and ""Miss Universe"" pageants, and Trump sued.NBC is a unit of Comcast Corp.. Fox News is part of the Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, ABC News is owned by Walt Disney Co, while Time Warner Inc owns CNN. CBS Corp is also publicly traded.

By Emily Stephenson and Amanda Becker
| WILMINGTON, Ohio/WASHINGTON

WILMINGTON, Ohio/WASHINGTON Some of Donald Trump's Hispanic backers distanced themselves from the Republican nominee on Thursday for standing by a hardline approach to illegal immigration in a key speech after indicating for weeks that he may soften his approach.Trump tried to clarify confusion about immigration, his signature policy issue, in a speech on Wednesday. He said the only way undocumented foreigners could live in the United States legally if he is elected on Nov. 8 would be to leave the country and apply for re-entry.But the businessman, trailing Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in opinion polls, did back away from earlier promises to deport immediately the 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally and said he would prioritize those with criminal records.While polls show a large majority of Hispanic voters oppose Trump, the withdrawal of support from among his small group of Latino backers underscores how difficult it is for Trump to broaden his support with minorities and moderate voters.    Alfonso Aguilar, who recently organized a support letter on behalf of Trump, said he felt ""disappointed and misled"" by the fiery speech and withdrew his backing. ""For the last two months he said he was not going to deport people without criminal records. He actually said that he was going to treat undocumented immigrants without criminal records in a humane and compassionate way,"" Aguilar told CNN. He is the president of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles group.  Trump used his Wednesday appearance in Phoenix to clarify his stance on illegal immigration. But instead of moderating his message as many expected, Trump returned to the hardline rhetoric that powered him to victory in the Republican presidential nomination race over 16 rivals, heartening conservatives drawn to Trump by the issue.      Some members of a council Trump formed last month to advise him on Hispanic issues expressed reservations about or cut ties to the New York real estate developer's candidacy after the Phoenix speech.
Jacob Monty, a Texas attorney and member of the group, said he was withdrawing his support and would not vote in the election.""There was nothing pro-business in that speech,"" Monty told MSNBC. ""We were hoping for some glimmer of the Donald Trump that we met with a week and half ago, but it never came.""""SCAM""
Panel member Ramiro Pena, a Baptist pastor in Texas who spoke at the Republican National Convention in July, wrote in an email to party leaders that he believed Trump would lose the election and that the advisory panel was a ""scam."" 
But other Latino advisers, including Florida pastor Mario Bramnick and Kentucky State Senator Ralph Alvardo, said they would continue working with the Trump campaign.Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus downplayed the fallout from Trump's speech, telling CNN that the nominee made clear he first wants to build the border wall and deal with criminal elements, then have a ""humane conversation"" about other illegal immigrants.""Somehow or another no one is talking about that piece,"" Priebus said. At a campaign rally on Thursday in Wilmington, Ohio, Trump said his immigration plan would treat everyone with ""dignity, respect and compassion"" but prioritize compassion for American citizens and include some kind of ideological screening. 
""We only want to admit those into our country who share our values and love our people,"" Trump said.     Trump gave his Phoenix address, which was flagged as a major policy speech, just hours after he met with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico City. At a joint press conference after the meeting, Trump said the pair discussed his campaign promise to build a border wall but not which country would pay for it. Pena Nieto said on Twitter on Wednesday night he had ""made it clear"" Mexico would not be paying for the wall.Trump supporters at the Wilmington rally said they approved of the candidate's immigration policies but moderate Republicans in Arizona, where Latinos make up more than 30 percent of the population, told Reuters they were less swayed by his message.Clinton's campaign called Trump's immigration speech a ""disaster"" and said it would begin running advertisements in Arizona, a sign it sees a chance of winning a state that has long backed Republican presidential candidates.Clinton raised about $143 million in August for her presidential bid and the Democratic Party, her campaign announced. Trump has not yet released his fundraising totals for the month of August.
