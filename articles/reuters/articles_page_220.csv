WASHINGTON The United States plans to use upcoming talks with top Chinese officials to discuss ways to bring greater pressure to bear on North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions, a senior U.S. official said on Tuesday.""The outcome that we're looking for is North Korean agreement to negotiate the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,"" Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel told reporters.
""We have a vastly improved chance of getting that with China's full cooperation, and we intend to use the (U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue) to game out how we can speed up the outcome that we're both working to achieve,"" he said.

By Julia Edwards
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday filed an emergency motion to stop sanctions imposed by a federal judge in Texas that  included mandated ethics classes for federal prosecutors, as part of ongoing litigation over immigration policy.The sanctions were ordered on May 19 by District Judge Andrew Hanen, who ruled in February 2015 that President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration were outside the bounds of the president's authority.Hanen also ordered the Department of Homeland Security to prepare a state-by-state review of immigrants who were given three years of safeguards from deportation under Obama's previous immigration action instead of two. The case has been brought before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
The Justice Department asked Hanen to put a hold on the sanctions while it seeks a review from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.The Justice Department will ask the Fifth Circuit for an appeal of the decision, a mandamus order or both to block the sanction order. 
In the court filing, in Houston, the Justice Department said it ""takes with utmost seriousness the public trust committed to it to represent the interests of the American people in the courts of the United States, and insists that its attorneys adhere to the high standards of ethical conduct and professionalism required to carry out that critical mission.""    ""The court's order to turn over immigration records would undermine trust in the Department of Homeland Security's ability to maintain the confidentiality of personal information, which is essential to its mission,"" said Patrick Rodenbush, a spokesman for the Justice Department, in connection with the review ordered by Hanen.

WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a union's appeal of a lower court's ruling that allowed Atlantic City's Trump Taj Mahal casino, founded by Donald Trump but now owned by billionaire investor Carl Icahn, to break its contract with union workers to secure a bankruptcy rescue deal.The high court's decision not to hear the appeal by Unite Here Local 54 leaves in place a January decision by the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that cleared the way for the casino to exit Chapter 11 bankruptcy.The struggling casino has since emerged from bankruptcy and is now owned by Icahn Enterprises LP. It was the New Jersey city's largest casino when Trump opened it in 1990 but it later fell on hard times along with other Atlantic City casinos.
Trump, the billionaire real estate developer and presumptive Republican U.S. presidential nominee, founded the casino and it bears his name, but he has said he no longer has a stake in it.In 2014, the casino's owner, Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc, filed for bankruptcy. Last year, it convinced a U.S. bankruptcy judge that it had to impose a new lower-cost contract on unionized workers in order to secure Icahn's rescue deal.
The union appealed, arguing that because the collective bargaining agreement expired before the bankruptcy, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction.
The appeals court sided with Trump Entertainment, saying a bankruptcy judge must be free to evaluate a labor contract that may determine the fate of a business. (Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)"

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to hear an appeal asserting that the death penalty violates the U.S. Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment filed by a Louisiana man convicted of fatally shooting his pregnant former girlfriend.Two of the eight justices, liberals Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, said they would have accepted the case, repeating concerns about the death penalty's constitutionality they raised in a different case last year.The justices, who have sharply disagreed among themselves over capital punishment, declined to consider the appeal brought by Lamondre Tucker, who was sentenced to death for the 2008 murder of 18-year-old Tavia Sills in Shreveport. Sills, nearly five months pregnant, was shot three times and her body was dumped in a pond.Tucker, who is black, had argued in part that black males had an increased likelihood of being convicted of murder and sentenced to death in Louisiana's Caddo Parish due to endemic racism.At the time of Tucker's conviction, a Confederate flag, symbol of the pro-slavery Southern states that lost the U.S. Civil War that ended in 1865, flew outside the county courthouse, his lawyers said in court filings.
Breyer wrote that Tucker ""may well have received the death penalty not because of the comparative egregiousness of his crime, but because of an arbitrary feature of his case, namely geography.""""One could reasonably believe that if Tucker had committed the same crime just across the Red River in, say, Bossier Parish, he would not now be on death row,"" Breyer said.Breyer's comments echoed similar remarks he made in June 2015 when the court upheld Oklahoma's lethal injection procedures. 
The shorthanded court has steered clear of taking major cases since the February death of Justice Antonin Scalia, but even at full strength may not have accepted this one.There is no indication the court is any closer to taking a case that would challenge the death penalty directly, with the court's two other liberals, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, not joining Breyer's opinion. Four votes are needed for the justices to hear a case. 
The pregnant Sills had told Tucker she believed he was the father. Later testing showed Tucker, 18 at the time of the murder, was not the father. The fetus did not survive.The Supreme Court left in place a September 2015 Louisiana Supreme Court ruling that rejected Tucker's legal arguments and upheld his conviction and death sentence.In the United States, 31 states have the death penalty and 19 do not.

WASHINGTON U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday joined a chorus of Republican stalwarts publicly urging Marco Rubio to run for a second Senate term in Florida, as the party faces an uphill fight to maintain its control of the Senate.""We're doing everything to encourage him to run,"" McConnell said during an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" program.Some political strategists and Senate Republican aides see a potentially weak field of Republican candidates for the Florida Senate seat and think Rubio could help Republicans hold their Senate majority if he entered the race.He has until June 24 to decide if he wants to run in the Aug. 30 Republican primary.Josh Holmes, a former McConnell chief of staff, said in a telephone interview that unlike many of the current Republican candidates for the seat, Rubio ""still enjoys pretty high favorability and very high name ID ratings in Florida and the ability to raise a lot of money.""
Republicans now hold 54 of the chamber's 100 seats. There are 44 Democrats and two independents who align themselves with the Democrats.McConnell is trying to hold onto his job as Senate majority leader but with 24 Republican seats up for grabs in the Nov. 8 elections and only 10 Democratic seats in play, it will be a difficult bid.
Last week, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker said in a statement that he had ""strongly encouraged"" Rubio to enter the race.Rubio, a freshman senator elected in 2010, decided to retire from the Senate and instead seek the U.S. presidency.But his effort came to an end in March after he was soundly defeated in the Florida Republican primary by Donald Trump, now the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election.
In a CNN ""State of the Union"" interview that aired on Sunday, Rubio was asked he if would ever seek public office in the future. ""I think that's a safe assumption,"" he said, without elaborating.During the interview, Rubio also said he would like to become commissioner of the National Football League.

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear an appeal by State Farm contesting a jury finding that the insurance company defrauded the federal government when assessing damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 along the Gulf of Mexico coast.The court will review a 2015 ruling by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upholding the verdict in a suit brought under the federal False Claims Act, which lets people sue over allegations that the government has been defrauded.The court will consider a lawsuit brought by sisters Cori and Kerri Rigsby, former claims adjusters who worked with State Farm after the hurricane. People win a portion of the damages if such a False Claims Act suit is successful.The jury found that the U.S. government had been defrauded of $250,000 over a house that had sustained Katrina-related damage in Biloxi, Mississippi.
The Rigsbys said the damage was caused by wind, which would be covered by the owners' policy with State Farm. But State Farm concluded that the damage was flood-related, which was covered by the federal government's flood insurance program.The court said State Farm would have to pay $758,000 in damages. The Rigsbys were awarded $227,000 under the False Claims Act.
State Farm argued in part that the lawsuit should have been thrown out because the Rigsbys' former lawyer, Dickie Scruggs, had distributed information about the lawsuit to members of the media. False Claims Act lawsuits are required to be filed under seal and remain private for 60 days.In 2008, Scruggs was convicted of conspiring to bribe a judge in a different case. He was sentenced to five years in prison.
The court will hear oral arguments and issue a ruling in the case during its next term, which begins in October and ends in June 2017. (Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)"

WASHINGTON California Governor Jerry Brown on Tuesday endorsed Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, saying it was the only way to keep Republican Donald Trump out of the White House.""I have decided to cast my vote for Hillary Clinton because I believe this is the only path forward to win the presidency and stop the dangerous candidacy of Donald Trump,"" Brown said in a letter to California Democrats and independents posted online.Brown, a popular Democrat who has steered the nation's most populous state on a centrist path, praised Clinton's rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, but noted that she had won about 3 million more votes and hundreds more delegates.""In other words, Clinton's lead is insurmountable and Democrats have shown - by millions of votes - that they want her as their nominee.""California is the biggest prize of the six states that hold presidential nominating contests on June 7, with 475 delegates.
Clinton has secured 2,310 delegates, 73 short of the number needed to clinch her party's nomination for the Nov. 8 election. As he noted in his letter, Brown himself waged a populist presidential campaign in 1992, losing to then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, with themes similar to many espoused by Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist.
Running on the slogan ""We the People,"" Brown railed against the influence of money in Washington and said politicians were ""bought and paid for.""But Brown said Democrats need to stop fighting each other so they can focus on beating Trump, who he said presents a danger to immigrants, the environment and world peace.
""The stakes couldn't be higher. Our country faces an existential threat from climate change and the spread of nuclear weapons. A new Cold War is on the horizon,"" Brown wrote. ""Hillary Clinton, with her long experience, especially as secretary of state, has a firm grasp of the issues and will be prepared to lead our country on day one.""

CHICAGO Chicago will be able to spread out state-mandated higher payments to its police and fire pensions after the Illinois Legislature on Monday overrode the governor's veto of a bill that became entangled in a political impasse.The Senate voted 39-19 and the House voted 72-43 to undo Republican Governor Bruce Rauner's veto on Friday that the city claimed would lead to a $300 million property tax hike.The bill gives Chicago short-term budget relief but will add to the city's big pension funding gap. The override bolsters Democrats, who control the legislature, as they battle with Rauner over state assistance for Chicago and its public school system, which is seeking state money for its teachers' pensions. The political impasse had left Illinois without a complete budget 11 months into fiscal 2016.Rauner called the bill ""terrible policy,"" while Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel accused him of using the city as a political pawn.
Rauner's spokeswoman Catherine Kelly released a statement reiterating the governor's contention that the measure would end up costing Chicago taxpayers $18.6 billion over time.The measure alters a 2010 state law that boosted Chicago's payments to its public safety workers' pensions in order to reach a 90 percent funded level by 2040. Under that law, Chicago's contribution will jump to nearly $834 million this year from $290.4 million in 2015, according to city figures.The new law reduces the payment to $619 million and allows for smaller increases through 2020 than under the 2010 law. It also gives the police and fire funds until 2055 to become 90 percent funded. The police system is 26 percent funded and the fire system 23 percent funded.
Chicago's fiscal 2016 budget assumed the bill's enactment by lowering the city's contribution to police and fire pensions by about $220 million. The city council also approved a $543 million phased-in property tax to exclusively cover higher contributions to the two retirement systems.House Speaker Michael Madigan was clearly delighted as he addressed reporters after budget talks with Rauner.
""I think it was interesting the governor had nothing to say about the override. I was raised not to cause embarrassment for people so I didn't raise it,"" Madigan said.The city must still deal with underfunding problems for its municipal and laborers' retirement systems after the Illinois Supreme Court in March tossed out a 2014 law that cut benefits and increased contributions to keep the pension funds from insolvency.

At least five animal rights activists on Monday rushed the stage as presidential candidate Bernie Sanders spoke at a rally in Oakland, video posted online showed.The protesters were led away by several Secret Service agents before they were able to reach the Democrat, whose speech was briefly interrupted by the disturbance, a video posted by CNN showed.A Secret Service agent rushed to Sanders' side, grabbed him and wrapped his arms around the presidential candidate during the ruckus.   ""We don't get intimidated easily,"" said Sanders, as he resumed his speech.
Animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere claimed responsibility for the protest, saying in a statement that it hoped to persuade Sanders to take a tough stance against factory farms. ""Bernie Sanders claims to support the 'good' farms,"" activist Rachel Ziegler said in the statement. ""But as our repeated investigations have shown, even the 'good' farms are horrific."" 
The organization posted a video online showing at least five protesters being led away by security personnel after they climbed onto the stage.  Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is running far behind Hillary Clinton in the race for the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election.
