MOSCOW Russian President Vladimir Putin said he did not know who was behind the hacking of U.S. Democratic Party organizations but the information uncovered was important, Bloomberg news agency reported on Friday.In an interview two days before a G20 meeting in China with U.S. President Barack Obama and other world leaders, Putin said it might be impossible to establish who engineered the release of sensitive Democratic Party emails but it was not done by the Russian government.""Does it even matter who hacked this data?"" Putin said. ""The important thing is the content that was given to the public.""""There's no need to distract the public's attention from the essence of the problem by raising some minor issues connected with the search for who did it,"" he added. ""But I want to tell you again, I don't know anything about it, and on a state level Russia has never done this.""The hacked emails, released by activist group WikiLeaks in July, appeared to show favoritism within the Democratic National Committee (DNC) for presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and prompted the resignation of the body's chairwoman.A computer network used by Clinton's campaign, and the party's fundraising committee for the U.S. House of Representatives were also hacked.
Clinton, who polls show as leading Donald Trump in the campaign for the U.S. presidential election in November, has said Russian intelligence services conducted a cyber attack against her party. Some officials have suggested Moscow is trying to influence the U.S. election.Putin dismissed the allegations. ""We have never interfered, are not interfering and do not intend to interfere in domestic politics,"" he said. ""We will carefully watch what happens and wait for the election results. Then we are ready to work with any American administration, if they want to themselves.""
Relations between Russia and United States hit a post-Cold War low in 2014 over the Ukraine crisis, and Washington and Moscow have since clashed over diverging policies in Syria.Obama said in August he would discuss the cyber attack with Putin if Russia was responsible, but it would not ""wildly"" alter the two countries' relationship.The U.S. election contest has been hard fought and frequently dominated by both candidates' attitudes toward Russia.
Clinton has rounded on her Republican rival Trump for his perceived praise of Putin and what she says is an ""absolute allegiance"" to Russia's foreign policy aims. Trump, in return, has said Clinton's own close ties to the Russian president deserve greater scrutiny.Putin said both candidates were using shock tactics and that playing ""the anti-Russian card"" was short-sighted.""I wouldn't like for us to follow their example,"" he said. ""I don't think they are setting the best example."" (Reporting by Katya Golubkova,; Writing by Jack Stubbs,; Editing by Angus MacSwan and Mark Trevelyan)"

| MIDWAY ATOLL

MIDWAY ATOLL President Barack Obama snorkeled on Thursday in the electric-blue water off Midway Atoll, a remote coral reef that serves as a reminder of both modern global climate challenges and the United State's dominance in the Pacific since its World War Two victory there.The journey was aimed at sending a message about the need to protect vulnerable species and spaces from the ravages of climate change.But it was also timed as Obama makes his way to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and other world leaders in his last visit to Asia, having sought to refocus U.S. defense and trade policy on the region.""It's a signal, it's a message saying the United States is committed to staying in the Pacific, and not sort of backing away,"" said naval historian Tom Hone, who has studied the Battle of Midway.Zipping around the island in an 18-golf-cart motorcade filled with Secret Service, aides and camera crews, Obama stopped to see several endangered green sea turtles lazily paddle in to bask on the white sand beach.""When I grew up, we'd see these turtles all the time. You almost never see them beaching like this, just basking in the sun,"" said Obama, who grew up in Hawaii, more than 1,100 nautical miles to the southeast.Obama, whose presidency comes to an end in five months, has tried to use his time in office to make Americans more passionate about climate change.Less than 5 percent of American voters say the environment is the most important issue facing the country, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling between July 24 and Aug. 21, and 35 percent say climate change will not affect the way they vote in the Nov. 8 election to pick Obama's successor.
The island visit bookends Obama's trip last year to Alaska, where he hiked on a shrinking glacier.""These aren't 'photo ops' - I think these are real opportunities to help the American people understand,"" said Carol Browner, a former head of the Environmental Protection Agency who advised Obama on climate issues in his first term.""He can get a level of attention that nobody else can get,"" Browner said.Last week, Obama quadrupled the size of Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument to create the world's largest marine monument, protecting the area off the coast of Hawaii from commercial fishing and drilling.
""This is going to be a precious resource for generations to come,"" said Obama, his dress shirt undone an extra button in the sauna-like heat.""This is hallowed ground,"" he said near a beach where young soldiers hunkered down under pillboxes, awaiting Japanese fighter planes during the World War Two Battle of Midway, one of the most-studied battles in military history.""Had it not been for the courage and the bravery of those airmen, we might have not seen the tide turn in the battle of the Pacific,"" he said.In June 1942, U.S. forces, tipped by code-breakers that the Japanese navy was planning an attack, sank four Japanese aircraft carriers and a heavy cruiser in a giant air and sea battle.
Obama's golf cart motorcade bumped over a tarmac pock-marked by shrapnel from the battle, passing old hangars and a ""bone yard"" of scrap metal, old office chairs, and broken appliances.Massive bags held some of the 20 tons of plastic ocean garbage that land on the island each year, 5 tons of which come from the bellies of albatrosses, which feed the plastic to their young, often fatally.Curious tern fledglings checked out his entourage, which tripled the island's average population of about 35 humans.""Watch the burrow!"" called Miel Corbett, a Fish and Wildlife Services spokeswoman, as a visitor narrowly avoided stomping the underground home of the bonin petrel. About a million of the birds swoop out of their nests each night at dusk.Vestiges of the island's former life as a large naval base remain, although many have fallen into decay. Visitors have not been allowed since 2012 because of tight budgets. Reporters wrote their stories in a still-working 1970s bowling alley, just down the way from barber shop.

By Roberta Rampton
| ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE

ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE Barack Obama starts his last trip to Asia on Saturday as U.S. president, aiming to put a final stamp on his signature policy shift toward the Pacific but distracted by crises ranging from Brexit to the battle against Islamic State.With the clock ticking down on his presidency, Obama will attend a G20 summit in China, a visit that will underscore the challenges he has faced with a rising world power that is both an economic partner and strategic rival.His final meetings in the region with Chinese President Xi Jinping could set the tone for his White House successor, who will be elected in November and take office in January.Obama will seek to highlight his legacy of stronger ties with Southeast Asia, particularly during the first-ever U.S. presidential visit to Laos, and his success in elevating the issue of climate change on the world stage.But there will be few bright spots in talks with fellow world leaders, who are grappling with the sagging global economy, fallout from Britain's vote to leave the European Union, increasing suspicion of globalization, the fight against Islamic State militants and territorial disputes in East Asia.During his past nine trips to Asia, Obama has sometimes been distracted by other international developments from the emphasis he sought to place on boosting U.S. military and economic ties to the fast-growing region, leading critics to doubt whether the U.S. commitment will last.  The latest visit coincides with the race to succeed Obama in the Nov. 8 presidential election, where Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of state and co-architect of his Asia strategy, has opposed his Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, raising concerns among the 12 nations in the pact.Republican nominee Donald Trump has alarmed allies like Japan and South Korea by suggesting they should pay more for their security and even develop their own nuclear weapons to protect against the threat posed by North Korea.Derek Chollet, a former defense adviser to Obama, said one of the challenges the United States faces is reassuring  governments in Asia that the United States means what it says when it comes to rebalancing towards the region.
""Asia partners are suspicious that even if we really mean it, that we're easily sidetracked,"" said Chollet, author of ""The Long Game,"" a book about Obama's foreign policy.LOW EXPECTATIONS FOR OBAMA-XI TALKS
Obama will start his visit on Saturday with China's Xi. The leaders have forged cooperation on combating climate change and curbing Iran's nuclear drive but have failed to narrow their countries' main differences. 
Irritants include U.S. accusations of Chinese cyber hacking, disputes over trade and Beijing's pursuit of contested claims in the South China Sea.Michael Green, a top Asia adviser to former Republican President George W. Bush, said he did not expect the Obama-Xi meeting to yield much. ""No grand joint declaration as we saw early in the administration, no celebration - perhaps some agreements on climate change - but a pretty rough and scratchy relationship,"" Green said.Obama faces another tricky meeting when he holds talks with NATO ally Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, with relations strained over strategy on Syria's civil war and concerns about Erdogan's crackdown on opponents after July's failed coup.White House aides have left open the prospect of an informal encounter with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which whom Obama is sharply at odds over Syria and Ukraine.China will closely watch Obama's first meeting with brash new Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, slated for Tuesday at an East Asia summit in Laos. In July, the Philippines, with U.S. backing, won a challenge against China's South China Sea claims at an international arbitration court.
Despite the longtime U.S.-Philippines alliance, Duterte recently insulted the U.S. ambassador, calling him a ""gay son of a whore."" Evan Medeiros, Obama's former top Asia adviser, said such comments plus Duterte's skepticism about the U.S. relationship meant that trust needed to be rebuilt. The White House has said Obama will not pull his punches over human rights concerns, which include thousands of extra-judicial killings since Duterte took office two months ago, according to date released this week. Strains with Duterte could add to Obama's difficulties in forging a united front on the South China Sea with Southeast Asian partners.China may see an opportunity to ""drive a wedge"" between the United States and Philippines as Beijing seeks a bilateral arrangement with Manila over the South China Sea, Medeiros said.Western diplomats in Beijing, however, said the Chinese government had its own difficulties reading Duterte.""He seems to change his mind every 24 hours,"" said one senior Western envoy, referring to Duterte's China policy.

By Dustin Volz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A Romanian hacker nicknamed ""Guccifer"" who helped expose the existence of a private email domain Hillary Clinton used when she was U.S. secretary of state was sentenced on Thursday to 52 months in prison by a federal court in Alexandria, Virginia.Marcel Lazar, 44, who used the alias online, had pleaded guilty in May to charges including unauthorized access to a protected computer and aggravated identity theft after being extradited from Romania. Lazar's public defender, Shannon Quill, was not immediately available for comment.Lazar has said in interviews he breached Clinton's private server at her home in Chappaqua, New York, but law enforcement and national security officials say that claim is meritless.
Lazar is believed to have hacked into email accounts of about 100 victims between 2012 and 2014.They include prominent political figures such as former Secretary of State Colin Powell, a relative of former President George W. Bush and Sidney Blumenthal, a former Clinton White House aide and an unofficial adviser to Clinton. Clinton is now the Democratic nominee for president.
Lazar leaked online memos Blumenthal sent Clinton that were addressed to her private email account, which was used during her time as secretary of state to conduct both personal and work business in lieu of a government account. Clinton's email arrangement, which became the subject of an FBI investigation, has drawn intense scrutiny from Republicans attempting to sow doubt about her honesty ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election.
An entity calling itself ""Guccifer 2.0"" and claiming to be a Romanian hacker emerged in June and began taking credit for data breaches at the Democratic National Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.U.S. intelligence officials and cyber security experts believe Guccifer 2.0 is a front for Russian intelligence services intended to spread confusion about the hacks against the Democratic Party.

By Ginger Gibson and Michelle Conlin

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's effort to clarify his position on illegal immigration during visits to both sides of the U.S.-Mexico frontier on Wednesday did little to sway moderate Republicans near the border, a dozen voters in Arizona told Reuters on Thursday.They were either unaware of his whirlwind tour or found that his uncharacteristically diplomatic demeanor during a visit with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico City was overshadowed by his return to his usual fiery rhetoric when back on U.S. soil a few hours later.""I hope that he does really, in his heart, have a little more compassion than what he spouts out,"" said Dave Mitchell, 58, of Surprise, Arizona, a self-described moderate who says he is begrudgingly planning to vote for Trump.Arizona, a reliably Republican state in past elections, could prove to be a close race in the battle between Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project, which is based on a national online opinion poll, found Trump leading Clinton by only 3 percentage points in the state as of Aug. 26. Trump's last-minute visit on Wednesday to Mexico was designed to appeal to moderate voters, including those most affected by illegal immigration, who are worried that the real estate mogul and former reality TV star lacks the temperament to engage in international diplomacy. Pena Nieto had on Wednesday afternoon hailed the impromptu meeting with Trump as ""open and constructive."" Trump later referred to the Mexican leader as his friend and a ""wonderful"" president.But only hours after leaving Mexico, Trump delivered a speech in Phoenix, Arizona, in which he again emphasized his desire to build a wall along the southern border and deport millions of people who had entered the United States illegally. 
Pena Nieto later rebuked Trump as a threat to his country.Trump launched his campaign last year on a promise to build a wall along the Mexican border to stop illegal immigration, and accused Mexico of sending rapists and drug dealers into the United States.Clinton's campaign announced on Wednesday night it would begin running TV commercials in Arizona, a sign it sees a chance of winning there on Nov. 8.
TONE PROBLEM
For many moderate Republicans in Arizona, Trump's efforts on Wednesday fell flat.Linda Yaeger, a 62-year-old retired Air Force officer who teaches at a community college in Glendale, said she watched Trump's appearance in Mexico on her tablet between classes. She said she had hoped Trump would take a more moderate tone after the meeting with the Mexican president, but was disappointed by his speech later that day in her home state.""Being a moderate Republican means (being) an endangered species right now,"" Yaeger said, explaining that she felt the party had moved too far to the right.  
Lois Pidde, 70, an office manager in Casa Grande, said she agreed with Trump that immigration is a problem, but opposed his proposed solutions, such as the need for a border wall or a suspension of Muslim immigration to shore up national security. ""I used to be able to turn him off when he was on 'The Apprentice' and I'd like to keep it that way,"" she said, referring to Trump's reality TV show. She said she was likely to vote for New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate.Josh Jensen, 35, a Border Patrol agent from southeastern Arizona, said he thinks Trump's plan to build a wall is ill-conceived and is voting for Johnson too.""I was thinking maybe Hillary over Trump,"" Jensen said. ""But I can't vote for either one of the two candidates.""April Chase, 58, of Arizona, was aware of Trump's trip to Mexico but did not watch it. A moderate Republican, she plans to write in U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont - who lost the Democratic primary campaign to Clinton. She said she felt Trump was dishonest, ""so I kind of steered away from that.""

NEW YORK In a speech on Wednesday in Phoenix, Arizona, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump outlined his plan for reforming the U.S. immigration system.The New York businessman has made immigration a central issue of his bid for the White House, taking a harder line than his Democratic rival, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, ahead of the Nov. 8 election.Trump's plan includes:1. Building a wall along the border between the United States and Mexico. Trump emphasized that this would be a physical wall, albeit bolstered by technology.2. Ending ""catch and release,"" a term often broadly used to refer to practices under which not everyone apprehended by immigration agents is necessarily deported.3. Immediate deportation of undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes. Trump has promised to begin these deportations on his first day in office. Going forward, undocumented immigrants arrested for committing a crime would be placed into immediate deportation proceedings.
4. Blocking funding for ""sanctuary cities,"" places that limit, to differing extents and through different methods, how much they help immigration officials in the apprehension and deportation of undocumented immigrants.5. Cancellation of executive orders and enforcement of immigration laws. This point would particularly hit two of President Barack Obama's executive actions, known by their abbreviations: DACA and DAPA. The actions gave a certain legal status to certain undocumented immigrants, such as those brought to the United States as children or those who now have American children. 
6. Suspending visas to immigrants from parts of the world where screening procedures are deemed inadequate. Trump singled out Syria and Libya as two countries from which immigration would be suspended.7. Ensuring that other countries take back their citizens when the United States moves to deport those immigrants. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that these people cannot be detained indefinitely, but without a country to which to return they often are simply released from detention. Trump said he would force the immigrants' home countries to take them back.8. Completing a biometric entry-exit visa tracking system. Many undocumented immigrants enter the country legally, and then overstay their visas. In those cases, this kind of system would be more effective than a border wall. While such a system has been discussed for years, the logistics remain a major challenge. Putting in such a system would likely require major overhauls of U.S. points of entry, such as airports and ports. 
9. Making it harder for undocumented immigrants to get jobs and benefits. Trump specifically cited the E-verify system as part of this. That system allows employers to check whether their employees are legally eligible to work in the United States. Trump also mentioned ending access to benefit programs such as public housing or food stamps.10. Serving the best interests of American workers. Trump's final point serves as something of a catch-all for his immigration proposal. But he also mentioned a few specific goals here, such as limiting immigration. He also talked about being more selective about who gets to enter the country, for example limiting immigration to people who can be financially self-sufficient.

By Ginger Gibson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Democrat Hillary Clinton raised about $143 million in August for her presidential bid and the Democratic Party, the her campaign announced on Thursday. Of the total, about $62 million was raised for the candidate's White House run and about $81 million was raised for the Democratic National Committee and state parties.Clinton spend most of the month of August working the Democratic fundraising circuit and trying to amass a war chest to use against Republican Donald Trump. The August hauls included a lucrative two-week swing of high-dollar events in the moneyed East Coast vacation spots of Martha's Vineyard and the Hamptons, along with star-studded luncheons in Los Angeles and gatherings with high-tech leaders in Silicon Valley.A three-day, $19 million fundraising trip to California included a stop at the home of former basketball star Magic Johnson, lunch at the home of musician Justin Timberlake and actress Jessica Biel and an afternoon event in Northern California with Apple's Tim Cook. 
Twenty people paid at least $200,000 each to attend a nighttime event at the estate where Laurene Powell Jobs is building a dream home designed by her late husband, Steve Jobs.Clinton has already saturated the airwaves in key states with television ads, while Trump has spent almost nothing on the general election.Trump has struggled to raise large sums of cash. Instead, much of his campaign has been self-funded, using his personal wealth to fuel his shoestring primary campaign. 
But supporters of Trump have warned that a general election requires more to be spent on expensive television ads and requires outside fundraising. Trump has not yet released his fundraising totals for the month of August.
Clinton's campaign has already announced plans to spend $77 million in swing state advertising before the Nov. 8 election. Her campaign said the average donation in March was $50, a signal that she is drawing from small-dollar donors and not just those who write checks worth thousands of dollars. ""Thanks to the 2.3 million people who have contributed to our campaign, we are heading into the final two months of the race with the resources we need to organize and mobilize millions of voters across the country,"" campaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement.

MEXICO CITY Donald Trump's pledge to make Mexico pay for a border wall is ""outrageous,"" its government said on Thursday, one day after the Republican presidential candidate visited Mexico City for talks with President Enrique Pena Nieto.""The proposal to build the wall, and to believe that Mexico could and would pay for it, is outrageous,"" presidential spokesman Eduardo Sanchez told local radio, after Trump's rapid, impromptu visit to Mexico on Wednesday.""What I know is that Mexico will not pay a single cent if they want to build a wall on that side of the border,"" he added.On Twitter early on Thursday, Trump wrote, ""Mexico will pay for the wall!""That prompted a Twitter reply from Pena Nieto later in the day: ""I repeat what I told you personally Mr Trump, Mexico would never pay for a wall.""Trump has sparked anger in Mexico with accusations on the campaign trail that the country sends rapists and drug runners to the United States, as well as his threats to tear up trade deals and make Mexico fund his planned wall.
At a news conference after their 70-minute meeting, Trump said he and Pena Nieto had not discussed who would pay for the wall he wants to prevent illegal immigrants from crossing the border.A few hours later, Pena Nieto contradicted Trump, saying he had told the American that Mexico would not foot the bill.
However, Trump told a cheering crowd of supporters in Arizona later on Wednesday that Mexico would pay for the wall ""100 percent.""After Trump had left Mexico, Pena Nieto was at pains to stress how he had brought home to the New York businessman the offense his comments have caused, calling his proposals a threat to the country.""I was very clear - in private and in public - in stressing that in Mexico we feel offended and hurt by his pronouncements about Mexicans,"" Pena Nieto wrote in a piece in the newspaper El Universal on Thursday entitled ""Why did I meet Donald Trump?""
""In his campaign speeches, Trump has not treated us like partners, nor as allies, based on a distorted picture of Mexico and its people,"" he went on, saying he had told Trump future cooperation between the two nations must be based on mutual respect.""Donald Trump's reaction was positive,"" he said.

By Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Senate Democrats would not agree to postponing completion of this year's spending legislation until 2017, the chamber's top Democrat said on Thursday, warning the majority Republicans against considering such an approach when Congress returns next week.Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid spoke after some conservative groups outside Congress earlier this week said it would be better for lawmakers not to finish a government appropriations bills until early 2017, when there will be a new president who could work out a deal with a newly elected Congress.The lawmakers return to work next week from a lengthy recess with appropriations bills unfinished for the coming fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. By law, lawmakers must act by Sept. 30 to approve the spending bills, or the government shuts down, as it did for two weeks in 2013 when appropriations bills had not been enacted in time.In a conference call with reporters, Reid said he worried that ""we're headed straight for another unnecessary government shutdown"" unless action is taken. Congress could pass a stop-gap continuing resolution that would keep the government running at current spending levels until next year, postponing final appropriations decisions until then without shutting down the government.
Reid said Democrats favored approving a shorter stop-gap bill that would let lawmakers return to Washington later this year - presumably after the Nov. 8 election - to finish spending bills.""But we are not doing anything into next year,"" he said. ""And the Republicans should be made aware of that right now."" Reid said he had met with President Barack Obama on Wednesday, implying Obama endorsed his stance.
Although Democrats are in the minority in both the Senate and House, rules requiring a supermajority for many Senate actions give Democrats significant leverage.More than two dozen conservative groups wrote to lawmakers this week saying they were worried that Congress would use what is called a ""lame duck"" session immediately after the election to tack on additional spending and corporate welfare provisions to the appropriations bills.
Among other things, Congress has not been able to decide how much to spend to fight the mosquito-borne Zika virus.The Republican leadership has not announced its plans for finishing work on spending bills.Staff members for both Republican leaders in the House and Senate said they would discuss the issue next week.
