By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Nearly half of American adults are ""very concerned"" about two issues that have hounded Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign this year: her use of a private email server to conduct government business and donations to her family's charitable foundation, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Wednesday. Both issues stem from Clinton's tenure between 2009 and 2013 as secretary of state, during President Barack Obama's first term. During that time, she used an unauthorized private email server to conduct government business - something that the Federal Bureau of Investigation earlier this summer criticized as ""extremely careless."" The Clinton Foundation's acceptance of donations from foreign governments and corporations while Clinton herself was secretary of state has drawn criticism about possible conflicts of interest. In August, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called on the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate whether Clinton granted any special favors in exchange for those donations.The Sept. 2-11 online poll found that 46 percent of American adults said they were ""very concerned"" about Clinton's use of a personal email account, while 47 percent said the same about donations from foreign governments or corporations to the Clinton Foundation.The public appears to have mostly responded to these issues along party lines, with nearly twice as many Republicans expressing concern as Democrats. However, a considerable portion of Democrats appear to be just as rattled by the reports.   
Among Democrats, 21 percent were very concerned about Clinton's emails, and 22 percent were very concerned about the Clinton Foundation donations. Among Clinton supporters, 14 percent said they are very concerned about the emails, and the same proportion said they are concerned about donations.The issues, which have drawn wide attention by the media and by her opponents, may have eroded Clinton's popularity, but it is not clear whether they have made a lasting impact on her level of support in the presidential race against Trump, where she holds a small lead.  
Since the beginning of August, a growing portion of Americans have expressed a negative view of Clinton. Yet, when asked to pick between her and Trump for president, Americans have given a small, but consistent advantage to Clinton.According to the poll, among the respondents who said they were concerned about the emails, 52 percent said the main reason was because the emails might contain classified information that was vulnerable to hackers. Another 40 percent were mostly concerned that Clinton had violated State Department policies. Among those who said they were concerned about donations to the Clinton Foundation, 48 percent said they were generally concerned about foreign money being contributed to organizations run by high-ranking politicians, while 38 percent said they were specifically concerned that donors had more access to Clinton while she was serving in the Obama administration.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It asked questions only to those respondents who were aware of the email and the Clinton Foundation issues. There were 2,745 respondents for the email questions, including 1,070 registered Democrats and 944 registered Republicans. There were  2,116 respondents for the Foundation questions, including 817 registered Democrats and 801 registered Republicans. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points for the entire sample, and 4 points for the Democrats and Republicans.

Members of Mana, the Spanish-language pop band, are embarking on what they hope will be their most influential series of performances - the U.S. ""Latino Power Tour"" - seeking to encourage Latinos to use their power at the polls in the Nov. 8 presidential election.""We are so proud, on one hand 'Latino Power Tour,' it's a celebration, but we're also suggesting for Latinos to use their power with their vote. They can change history in this country,"" said vocalist Fher Olvera.The tour opened in San Diego on Sept. 9 and is scheduled to end in Los Angeles on Nov. 13. The band, sometimes referred to  as ""the U2 of Spanish rock,"" will perform in 18 major arenas across the United States.The band from Guadalajara, Mexico, has always been vocal about denouncing violence and corruption in its home country. Now, in the wake of some unfavorable comments about Mexicans by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump - who has also threatened to expel millions of Mexicans - Mana feels its influence can make a difference in the United States as well.
""Latinos can move the scale of history in the United States, they can rewrite history and I believe they deserve a lot more than what has been given to them, and they have the power,"" Olvera said in an interview.For the ""Latino Power Tour,"" Mana will perform a career-spanning set including greatest hits and songs from its ninth studio album, ""Cama Incendiada"" (Bed on Fire). It has also partnered with organizations including Voto Latino and local advocates to provide both inspiration and information Latinos might need to make their voices heard in the upcoming election.
""More than anything, it's a huge celebration of the Latino community,"" said drummer Alex Gonzalez. ""You know, the Latino community has given so much and has worked so hard here in the United States, developed the country, especially economically. On the other hand also, this tour is to emphasize Latinos to go out and vote."" Mana has earned four Grammy Awards, eight Latin Grammy Awards and sold more than 40 million albums.

By Jonathan Allen
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation would spin off its flagship health project into a ""completely independent"" charity if Hillary Clinton were to win the U.S. presidency in November, the charity announced on Wednesday.The Clinton Health Access Initiative, which has focused on reducing the cost of HIV medicine in sub-Saharan Africa, currently accounts for about two thirds of the foundation's annual income and expenses, according to disclosures online. The promise to carve it out of the foundation aims to quash concerns that donors might try to seek special access in a Clinton White House. Bill and Chelsea Clinton, Hillary Clinton's husband and daughter, would step down from the health project's board and the project would no longer use the Clinton name and instead would go by its acronym, CHAI, if the family returned to the White House next year, the announcement said.Clinton has defended her family's philanthropic organizations against accusations by Donald Trump, her Republican rival, and others that wealthy donors, abroad and at home, might expect favorable treatment from the U.S. government. She has said no donor ever received inappropriate favors, but her staff have said she recognizes reorganization would be necessary to avoid any appearance of conflicts of interests. 
On Tuesday, New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said his office had opened an inquiry into the Donald J. Trump Foundation to ensure the Republican presidential nominee's charity was complying with state laws governing nonprofits.The inquiry followed reports by The Washington Post regarding Trump's Foundation and his contributions to the charity. He has refused to release his tax returns, which would show charitable giving.
Long-time Clinton associates Bruce Lindsey, Ira Magaziner and Maggie Williams would also step down from CHAI's board, and the remaining board members would replace all five in consultation with global health experts, the charity said. Magaziner, who has been friends with Bill Clinton since they were students at Oxford University, would remain as the project's chief executive. The board would draft a ""succession plan"" by the end of the year, the announcement said.""If Secretary Clinton is elected president, the changes outlined here will be implemented and CHAI would become an organization completely independent of the Clinton Foundation,"" the statement said.
Bill Clinton set up the foundation as he prepared to leave the White House in 2001. Hillary Clinton joined its board after  leaving the U.S. State Department in 2013 but stepped down last year to seek the presidency. The foundation announced last month that it would no longer accept donations from foreigners or corporations for its other work besides CHAI, and said it would close overseas fundraising arms in Sweden and the United Kingdom.

The release came during a presentation on Tuesday from a person speaking on behalf of Guccifer 2.0 at a London cyber security conference, Politico reported.Reuters could not immediately access the documents. ""There's one person who stands to benefit from these criminal acts, and that's (Republican presidential nominee) Donald Trump,"" DNC interim Chair Donna Brazile said in a statement.
""Not only has Trump embraced (Russian President Vladimir)Putin, he publicly encouraged further Russian espionage to help his campaign,"" she said.Trump in July invited Russia to dig up emails from Clinton's time as secretary of state, prompting Democrats to accuse him of urging foreigners to spy on Americans. He later said he was speaking sarcastically.The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned as DNC chair on the eve of July's Democratic National Convention after WikiLeaks published an earlier trove of hacked DNC emails that showed party officials favoring eventual nominee Hillary Clinton over U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders during the party's nominating contests. Three other senior officials also stepped down from the DNC after the leak.""We have been anticipating that an additional batch of documents stolen by Russian agents would be released,"" said Brazile, who took over from Wasserman Schultz on an interim basis.
Democratic Party sources said the party and Clinton's presidential campaign were deeply concerned about possible publication by WikiLeaks or other hackers of a new torrent of potentially embarrassing party information ahead of the Nov. 8 election.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said on Tuesday he had opened an inquiry into the Donald J. Trump Foundation to ensure the Republican presidential nominee's charity was complying with state laws governing nonprofits.Schneiderman, a supporter of Trump's Democratic rival in the presidential race, Hillary Clinton, sued the real estate mogul and his now defunct Trump University for fraud in 2013, seeking $40 million in restitution plus penalties and other costs.In a CNN interview on Tuesday, Schneiderman said his office had now brought Trump's charitable foundation under scrutiny.""My interest in this issue really is in my capacity as regulator of nonprofits in New York state. And we have been concerned that the Trump Foundation may have engaged in some impropriety from that point of view,"" the elected Democratic official said.He added: ""We have been looking into the Trump Foundation to make sure it's complying with the laws that govern charities in New York."" He did not elaborate on what wrongdoing Trump's nonprofit might have committed.Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung dismissed Schneiderman's assertions as entirely motivated by presidential politics, calling the attorney general a ""partisan hack who has turned a blind eye to the Clinton Foundation for years.""
Cheung called Schneiderman's comments ""nothing more than another left-wing hit job designed to distract"" attention from Clinton's recent missteps on the campaign trail.Trump has accused Clinton of being corrupted by donors to the Clinton Foundation global charity founded by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, while she was U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.
Clinton has dismissed Trump's allegation as a political smear. There has been no evidence that foreign donors to the foundation obtained favors from the State Department while Clinton headed the agency.Schneiderman made his remarks when asked on CNN about calls from Democrats in Congress for a federal investigation of a $25,000 donation in 2013 from the Trump Foundation to a political committee supporting Florida's Republican attorney general, Pam Bondi. Democrats have cited an Associated Press report that Bondi solicited the donation personally, around the time her office was debating whether to join New York state's investigation into Trump's real estate training school in Florida. According to the AP, Bondi, who was seeking re-election at the time, broke off the lawsuit deliberations after the check arrived.
Bondi, who has endorsed Trump, has called the AP report misleading. (Additional reporting by Mohammad Zargham in Washington)"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

WASHINGTON Mylan NL Chief Executive Officer Heather Bresch will appear at a Sept. 21 congressional hearing over price increases for its EpiPen emergency allergy treatment, the U.S. House of Representatives Oversight Committee said in a statement on Wednesday.Mylan has been widely criticized, including by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, for sharply raising the price of EpiPens, which are carried by people with life-threatening allergies.Mylan, which acquired the product in 2007, recently raised the list price for a pair of EpiPen auto-injectors to $600. The price has been rising from a cost of about $100 in 2008. Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin confirmed that Bresch will attend the hearing.""Heather is very good at being able to give an answer without offering much information,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat, adding that he will be watching for any other issues that might be raised by the Committee. A probe into EpiPen pricing by a U.S. Senate subcommittee was announced on Sept. 7.
Bresch is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia.The House panel co-chairmen, Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz and Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings, noted there is ""... justified outrage from families and schools across the country struggling to afford the high cost of EpiPens.""
The committee planned to look at how to spur competition in the EpiPen market and speed approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of generic alternatives, according to the statement.In response to the furor, Mylan last month said it would sell its own generic version of EpiPen for $300.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, which for years has been working on developing a generic alternative to EpiPen, said last week that it hopes to gain U.S. approval by late 2017 or early 20018.
EpiPen, which has annual sales of about $1 billion, delivers a potentially life-saving dose of epinephrine by injection into the thigh to counter dangerous allergic reactions, including to peanuts and bee stings. Mylan owns 94 percent of the market for such auto-injected devices.The committee said it also planned to call as a witness Dr Doug Throckmorton, the FDA's deputy director at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.

By Dustin Volz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Delaying or blocking a planned transition of oversight of the Internet's technical management from the U.S. to a global community of stakeholders would be a ""gift to Russia"" and other authoritarian regimes, a senior Obama administration official said Wednesday.The comments before a congressional panel came as several Republican lawmakers are attempting to thwart the changeover, due to occur on Oct. 1, arguing it would stifle online freedom and has not been appropriately vetted.    ""I urge you: Do not give a gift to Russia and other authoritarian nations by blocking this transition,"" Lawrence Strickling, administrator of the U.S. Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration, told a Senate subcommittee.The plan, announced in March 2014, to transfer oversight of the nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, is expected to go forward unless Congress votes to block the handover. The California-based corporation operates the database for domain names such as .com and .net and their corresponding numeric addresses that allow computers to connect.
The U.S. Commerce Department currently oversees the Internet's management largely because it was invented in the United States. Its contract with ICANN will lapse on October 1.Senator John Thune, a senior Republican from South Dakota, told reporters Tuesday he expected lawmakers would add language to delay the Internet transition to a bill to fund the government past the end of September.Strickling's testimony were an attempt to rebut concerns raised by Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who convened and chaired Wednesday's hearing on the Internet, and other Republicans who have argued in recent weeks that the transition would be a ""giveaway"" of Internet control to Russia, China, and other governments that censor Internet content.
""When ICANN escapes from government authority, ICANN escapes from ... having to worry about protecting your rights or my rights,"" Cruz said.ICANN does not have the ability to censor the Internet, the corporation's CEO Goran Marby said during the hearing.
Tech companies, technical experts, academics, have said the transition is overdue and necessary to keep the Internet open and globally oriented, and that the proposal includes safeguards against any potential abuse by any one country.Delaying the transition to the multistakeholder global community may also weaken U.S. credibility in future international negotiations at the United Nations and elsewhere about Internet standards and security, thus empowering countries like Russia and China, experts have said.

By James Oliphant
| COLUMBUS, Ohio

COLUMBUS, Ohio Donald Trump's presidential candidacy has triggered anguished soul searching among many college-educated and affluent Republicans who must decide whether to back him, sit out the election, or do the unthinkable: vote for his opponent, Hillary Clinton.With less than two months to go before the Nov. 8 election, rural, white voters who lack a college degree have flocked to Trump. But his brash style and lack of experience in government are a much tougher sell among well-off Republicans who have long been a backbone of the party, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling and interviews with Republican-leaning white collar professionals.Trump's hopes of capturing the White House may rest on whether he can win over enough of these voters in battleground states such as Ohio, Virginia and Colorado to offset Clinton's overwhelming advantages with minority voters, young people, urban voters and women.""If you had told me two years ago that I would be voting for Hillary Clinton, I would have said, 'No freaking way,'"" said Michael Sheehan, chief operating officer of a Columbus-based apparel firm.Sheehan is now leaning toward Clinton, the Democratic nominee, because he worries Trump would damage U.S. relations abroad.Reuters/Ipsos polling shows that Clinton is doing better among affluent and college-educated voters than President Barack Obama did four years ago, even among Republicans. It's a warning  signal for Trump, who has been shunned by blacks, Latinos and millennial voters.In 2012, nearly nine out of every 10 Republicans with a college degree and annual income over $100,000 supported then Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Now, about seven in 10 support Trump.Romney won college-educated voters over Obama by 4 percentage points in 2012, but the Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll showed Clinton with a 48-28 percent advantage among those same voters last month. The same gap is playing out in key swing states. In Ohio, Clinton has a 47-36 percent edge among the college educated, according to a Monmouth University poll in August. ""It's amazing how few Trump supporters I've run into,"" said James King, a partner in a prominent Columbus law firm who backed Romney in 2012 but who likely will vote for Clinton.
Marsha Blackburn, a congresswoman from Tennessee who is one of Trump's biggest supporters in Washington, said Trump's proposal this week for a child-care tax credit was an example of policies that can appeal to more affluent Republicans. Trump still needs to ""keep pushing his economic message, keep talking about national security, keep talking about these issues that are so important to moms, these working-family issues,"" she told Reuters.ROMNEY REPUBLICANS
Ohio, with its 18 electoral votes, is crucial for Trump and he has campaigned intensively in the state. But in populous, largely suburban central Ohio, Trump has a tougher task than in the rural counties that surround it.
The local economy skews toward white-collar workers and professionals and does not depend on the manufacturing revival Trump has promised in his ""Make America Great Again"" message.Romney, the scion of a wealthy family and former private equity fund manager, was a more natural fit with many Republicans in the area. He epitomized what sometimes has been called the ""country club Republicans."" They favor smaller government, less intrusive regulations and put less weight on conservative social values.Trump, the real-estate magnate from Manhattan, would seem similar, but some Republican professionals in central Ohio can't get past his temperament and comments like the one suggesting illegal immigrants from Mexico are rapists and murderers. Romney himself has been a fierce critic of Trump.""There's no way I could ever vote for that guy,"" said King, the law firm partner, adding that Trump's criticism of the family of a Muslim soldier, Humayun Khan, who was killed in action, soured him on Trump for good.An NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll of registered voters last month showed Clinton ahead among white, college-educated voters in Colorado, where she held a 55-23 percent edge; in North Carolina, where she held a 47-40 percent advantage; and in Virginia, where she held a 43-37 percent edge. 
Bradley Barbin, a white-collar criminal defense lawyer in Columbus, has decorated the walls of his office with Republican memorabilia stretching back a century. He faults Trump for stirring resentment and for encouraging violence at his rallies.Trump has denied there is significant violence at his events and has blamed the media for exaggerating scuffles with protesters.Barbin said he likely won't back Clinton. ""Do I know exactly what I am going to do? No. But I do know that Trump's the bigger problem,"" he said.Among affluent Republicans who do support Trump, several said that whatever reservations they may have about him as a candidate, it was more important to keep Clinton from the presidency.""I think she's a bad person,"" said William Bay, a retired nephrologist who lives in Hilliard, a suburb of Columbus, who lauded Trump as an agent of change.Trump's campaign has long contended there exists a swath of Trump voters who won't talk to the press or pollsters for fear of being demonized, but who will show up at the polls in November.But it's also possible that some Republicans, once in the privacy of the voting booth, will go with Clinton because of their concerns about Trump. Barbin, the Columbus defense lawyer, said that's the takeaway from conversations with his peers.""We all know,"" he said, ""that there are certain people you just cannot give that kind of unfettered power to. You just can't."" (Additional reporting by Chris Kahn and Grant Smith; Editing by Caren Bohan and Ross Colvin)"	['Romney', 'Obama', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Ross']	[]
