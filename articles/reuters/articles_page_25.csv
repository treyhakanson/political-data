By Robin Emmott
| BRUSSELS

BRUSSELS NATO promised on Wednesday to defend all allies despite election victor Donald Trump's call to set conditions for U.S. help, as the alliance braced for a more impulsive leader some fear could withdraw funding to deter Russia.During the presidential election campaign Trump threatened to abandon U.S. allies in Europe if they do not spend enough on defence, comments that were particularly unnerving for the ex-Soviet Baltic states on Russia's border which fear Moscow might try a repeat of its 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said NATO's promise to defend any ally under attack was an unconditional guarantee set out in the Western alliance's founding treaty in 1949.""All allies have made a solemn commitment to defend each other and this is something which is absolute and unconditioned,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference, saying he would try to speak to Trump by telephone as soon as possible and would welcome him to a NATO summit in Brussels next year.""The U.S. commitment to NATO and the collective defence of Europe has been rock solid for almost 70 years and I am absolutely confident that it will still be the case,"" Stoltenberg said, noting that two world wars had shown the importance of stability in Europe to the United States.Trump's suggestion of making the United States' defence of its Western allies conditional was the first time a leading presidential candidate had raised the idea, putting him directly at odds with NATO's 27 other member states.  Diplomats questioned how long NATO's chief would be able to maintain a ""business as usual"" tone with a new U.S. leader who has expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, condemned by the West for his actions in Ukraine.""The idea that Trump's presidency is not going to create problems for NATO is delusional,"" said Dana Allin, a U.S. foreign policy expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation was founded around the central promise that an armed attack against one ally is an attack against all, whether it be on land, in the air or on the seas. NATO leaders in July added the area of cyberspace to that list of war fighting domains, although allies have to request NATO's help and decisions are on a case-by-case basis.Trump, a Republican who had never previously run for office, assumes the presidency on Jan. 20 after defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton in Tuesday's U.S. election.In one demonstration that not all U.S. Republicans share Trump's scepticism about NATO, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday he believes the NATO alliance ""is every bit as important today as it ever was.""
""I think Article 5 (of the NATO treaty) means something: you attack any member of NATO, you have us to deal with. I want the Russians to understand that fully,"" McConnell said in Washington when a reporter asked him if he shared Trump's attitude toward the alliance and Russia. One of NATO's top commanders stressed that the debate about the alliance's role was not a theoretical one, given the powerful Russian air defence systems in the Baltic region, in Crimea and in Syria that could limit NATO's freedom of movement.Allies need to build up a sophisticated air deterrent that can counter Russian long-range missiles, said General Denise Mercer, whose brief is to focus on future threats. DEFENCE SPENDING

After the fall of the Soviet Union a quarter of a century ago, NATO's European allies cut defence spending to historic lows, leaving the United States to make up around three quarters of the alliance's military expenditure. A newly assertive Russia under Putin has begun to change that and Europe is again spending more on defence. But Britain, Poland, Greece and Estonia are the only European nations to meet a NATO goal of spending at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defence. Germany, Europe's biggest economy, spends far less than 2 percent of its GDP on defence.Asked if she would now seek more funding for Germany's military, Defence Minister Ursula von derv Leyden told Reuters: ""I have to make it clear (to German lawmakers) what our posture is, what we need and that is the right way to proceed.""Stoltenberg said he expected an overall 3 percent real increase in European defence spending in 2016. He said if all European allies and Canada reached the 2 percent spending target it would generate an additional $100 billion for NATO. On financial markets, shares in European defence companies rose as investors bet arms spending would rise in response to Trump's calls for Europe to pay more for its security.A first sign of Trump's tough stance could come as early as next year, when the United States is due to deploy troops and heavy combat equipment to eastern Europe under a $3.4 billion U.S. spending plan for Europe to deter Russia.
Trump could scale back President Barack Obama's plan to quadruple funding under the European Reassurance Initiative (ERR) from just under $800 million - a significant investment in Europe after decades of cutting its presence in Europe. ""MUST RISE TO CHALLENGE""
France saw an opportunity to strengthen European defence.""Donald Trump said he wanted to ... stop paying for NATO, so countries like Poland need to ask themselves (what this means),"" Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Assault said. ""Rather than lowering our heads, we must rise to the challenge.""Trump has also threatened to withdraw U.S. forces from Europe if allies fail to pay more for U.S. protection, although U.S. ambassador to NATO Douglas Lute sought to reassure allies, saying: ""NATO has always been a bipartisan venture for the United States.""Trump has said NATO could become obsolete if it does not focus more on Isla mist militant groups hostile to the West, an area that is not traditionally a core focus of the alliance.Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister whose own country borders Russia, sought to remind the new president-elect that the only time NATO has activated its Article 5 commitment was following the Septa. 11 attacks in 2001.

By Mica Rosenberg and Susan Heavey
| NEW YORK/WASHINGTON

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON Republican President-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager on Wednesday said there has been no discussion of an appointment of a prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton's past practices while serving as President Barack Obama's secretary of state, a threat Trump made in an election debate.Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence are ""looking to unify the country, but we haven't discussed that in recent days, and I think that it's all in due time,"" campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on MSNBC when asked about the appointment of a prosecutor. Real estate developer and former reality TV host Trump stunned the world by defeating Democrat Clinton in Tuesday's U.S. presidential election. His four-year term starts on Jan. 20. Asked on CNN about the possibility of a special prosecutor, Conway said: ""We didn't discuss that last night, and he did not discuss that with Hillary Clinton on the phone."" Clinton called Trump to concede the race.During his victory speech in the early hours of Wednesday morning, Trump said it was ""time for American to bind the wounds of division."" Given Trump's promise to bring the country together, pursuing a case against Clinton could be a risky political strategy, said Katy Harriger, a political science professor from Wake Forest University in North Carolina.""I can't imagine anything more divisive than going after someone who may have won the popular vote,"" said Harriger, whose work focuses on the role of special prosecutors in U.S. politics.The White House on Wednesday also pointed to the nation's long history of not jailing political rivals in retribution. Appointing a prosecutor would also mean going against the recommendations of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The agency, which had been investigating Clinton's email practices, cleared her just two days ahead of the election and stood by its earlier finding that criminal charges were not warranted.During his second debate with Clinton on Oct. 9, Trump vowed to put Clinton in jail, attacking her for operating a private email server during her tenure as chief diplomat under Obama from 2009 to 2013, saying she had endangered national security. 
Trump said, ""If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation. Because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.""Under U.S. government regulations in place since 1999, the attorney general can appoint a special counsel because of a conflict of interest or because of ""other extraordinary circumstances."" Clinton, who has apologized over her use of a private server, defended herself at the St. Louis debate.If Trump chose to pursue an investigation, his appointee for attorney general would have ""broad discretion"" to assign a special counsel to the case, said Devin Schindler, a professor at Western Michigan University's Cooley Law School. 
REVENGE
The White House, asked about Trump's pledge to jail Clinton, said such a move would be unprecedented.""We've got a long tradition in this country of ... people in power not using the criminal justice system to exact political revenge. In fact, we go to great lengths to insulate our criminal justice system from partisan politics,"" Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters at a daily news briefing. ""That commitment has served our country very well for more than two centuries. And the president is hopeful that it will continue,"" he added. Obama does have the ability to issue a pre-emptive pardon of Clinton that would shield her from prosecution, even though no charges have been filed against her, said legal experts. 
Asked about such a possibility, Earnest said he could not speculate about any hypothetical pardons.After taking office, President Gerald Ford pardoned his predecessor, Richard Nixon, who had not been charged with a crime in the Watergate scandal, in an effort to move past the country's polarization.But Obama might be hesitant to issue a pardon, and Clinton to accept one, because under U.S. Supreme Court precedent, ""the acceptance of a pardon is the functional equivalent of admitting guilt,"" said Schindler.Peter Zeidenberg, who served as deputy special counsel in the investigation of former Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff and national security adviser, Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby, over government leaks during the George W. Bush administration, said a special prosecutor would have to take evidence to a grand jury overseen by a judge.Given what is known about Clinton's conduct, it is a ""nothingburger"" of a case, he said.Despite chants from Trump supporters at his campaign rallies to ""Lock her up,"" including at his election night victory party,  Zeidenberg and other legal experts said Trump may go back on his pledge to appoint a special prosecutor. ""It sounds good at the time, so he says it,"" said  Zeidenberg. ""But he has changed his position so many times he is like a weathervane in a windstorm.""

By Ingrid Melander
| BORDEAUX, France

BORDEAUX, France ""The French never vote like the Americans,"" a politician told a rally for presidential favorite Alain Juppe on Wednesday as France wondered if it would be the next country to prove the opinion polls wrong.Juppe, mayor of the southwest city of Bordeaux and a former prime minister, has topped the polls for months. Surveys predict he will win both a primary later in November to be the center-right's candidate and the presidential election in six months.But after pollsters failed to predict U.S. voters would make Donald Trump their country's 45th president, like their British colleagues who got the United Kingdom's vote to leave the EU wrong, France has started bracing for a possible surprise next year.""Juppe is ahead in polls and he will also win. The French are not like the Americans, we're not crazy,"" Juppe supporter Mbacoye Balde, 35, told Reuters at the Bordeaux rally.Nearby, another Juppe supporter carried a banner reading ""Ne vous Trumpez pas"" a French play on words with Trump's name  that meant ""Don't make a mistake."" 
""We've always been cautious about polls, we've always said one should not get carried away and it was not in the bag,"" Virginie Calmels, Juppe's deputy in Bordeaux and one of his campaign spokespersons, said of his strong ratings.    But she added: ""It's not quite the same in France and in the United States."" Unlike in the United States for the Trump vote, pollsters in France have recently tended to overestimate support for the anti-immigration National Front (FN), she said.The far-right party won no region in last year's local elections, despite forecasts it would get at least one. 
But its leader Marine Le Pen is another strong candidate in the presidential election and is expected to be one of the two contestants to make it into the runoff round - possibly against Juppe himself.Juppe told the rally that, if elected, he would ""obviously be available for dialogue with President Trump"" but spent much of his speech warning against populism, saying inclusiveness and hope were the answer.  
Juppe is campaigning on a moderate platform more to the center than the law-and-order strategy of main rival Nicolas Sarkozy, who was France's president in 2007-2012 and has courted controversy with his hard line on immigration and Islam.Without mentioning Sarkozy by name, Juppe said: ""Beware the false answers and bad solutions ... I say 'no' to divisiveness, 'no' to demagoguery that pit the French against one another."" ""I want the optimistic France to lift up the sad France,"" he said, just days ahead of the two-round primary on November 20 and 27 where he will compete against Sarkozy and five other candidates for the center-right's nomination.

By Amanda Becker
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Hillary Clinton walked onto the ballroom stage Wednesday morning to do what many had considered unthinkable: thank her campaign staff after failing in her bid to become the first woman elected U.S. president, instead of the anticipated victory speech under a symbolic glass ceiling.Hundreds of staffers and supporters gathered at the New Yorker Hotel in midtown Manhattan to hear Clinton speak publicly for the first time after her bruising loss to New York real estate magnate Donald Trump in the early hours of the morning.Many wore the same clothes as the night before, having stayed up all night after leaving the glass-ceilinged Jacob J. Javits Convention Center, where Clinton's final rally never materialized.Campaign Chairman John Podesta told the distraught crowd just after 2 a.m. to go home and expect to ultimately ""bring this home."" Shortly after, news broke that Clinton had telephoned Trump to concede. As staffers and supporters filed into the ballroom, there were tears, hugs, and disbelief that Clinton, a former secretary of state, U.S senator and first lady, had again failed to shatter what she called the ""highest and hardest glass ceiling"" after her first attempt at the presidency in 2008, when she lost in her bid for the Democratic nomination.This time, Clinton won the Democratic primary race, becoming the first women to secure a major party's nomination in her race against U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. But in the final contest for the White House, she lost to Trump, the unorthodox Republican nominee.
""We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought, but I still believe in America and I always will, and if you do then we must accept this result and then look to the future,"" Clinton said, with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, daughter Chelsea Clinton and Chelsea's husband, Marc Mezvinsky, at her side.Also on the stage were Clinton's vice presidential pick, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton.Clinton wore a black suit with purple lapels - the color created by combining blue and red, the colors that symbolize the two major U.S. political parties - and not the suffragette white that many expected Tuesday night. Bill Clinton wore a matching tie.Clinton urged her backers to seek unity in the wake of defeat.
""Donald Trump is going to be our president, we owe him an open mind and the chance to lead,"" she said.Likely facing her last opportunity for a presidential run, Clinton, 69, acknowledged the bitter sting of an election defeat in which initial results show she won the popular vote but came up short in the Electoral College vote that ultimately decides the race.Clinton had been leading Trump in public opinion polls for months, and in the final week of her campaign, her staff celebrated a drawn-out campaign marked with vitriol at star-studded rallies with performers such as Jon Bon Jovi, Jay Z and Beyonce. 
But as election returns came in, Trump pulled off major upsets in key states including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida that Clinton's campaign expected to win. Aides appeared visibly shaken as Tuesday night turned into Wednesday morning. ""Hate trumps love, I guess,"" a supporter in the ballroom on Wednesday said, flipping the phrase Clinton had used to close her rallies.Clinton thanked her supporters - women and young people in particular - and urged them to never give up.""I've had successes, and I've had setbacks, sometimes really painful ones. Many of you are at the beginning of your professional, public, political careers. You will have successes and setbacks too. This setback hurts, but please never stop believing that fighting for what is right is worth it,"" she said.

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican Donald Trump's presidential election victory all but dooms major Obama administration initiatives that are already tied up in legal challenges and gives him the chance to appoint a pivotal fifth conservative justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.Democratic President Barack Obama's signature 2010 healthcare law, his plan to combat climate change, his executive action on immigration, his transgender rights policy and other issues were challenged in court by Republicans and industry groups. (For a graphic on legal challenges to major Obama initiatives click tmsnrt.rs/2eznafM)A Trump administration could decide no longer to defend the policies in court after Trump takes office on Jan. 20. In addition, Trump and the incoming Republican-led Congress could simply repeal or rescind Obama's policies, as they have promised.Trump's Supreme Court appointment, possibly the first of multiple picks, would allow him to restore the decades-long conservative majority on the bench, which looked under threat when conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died in February. The shorthanded court currently is split with four conservatives and four liberals.Conservative activists may be emboldened to bring cases urging the court to support gun rights, uphold abortion restrictions and rule for religious rights.""If you have a conservative court, you are going to have more conservative decisions,"" said Kerri Kupec, a lawyer with the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group involved in religious rights cases.One issue the court could take up in the near term is whether business owners who oppose same-sex marriage can object on religious grounds to providing services to gay couples. One dispute concerns a baker in Colorado, while another involves a florist in Washington state.In the labor context, the high court could also revisit whether states can force nonunion workers to pay unions for collective bargaining activities. The court split 4-4 on the issue in March, just after Scalia's death, in a loss for conservative groups challenging the practice.Liberal hopes of gaining a majority on the Supreme Court for the first time in decades lasted almost nine months, from Scalia's death on Feb. 13 to Tuesday night.
In a vindication of Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell's decision, with little precedent in U.S. history, to take no action on Obama's nominee to replace Scalia, appeals court judge Merrick Garland, Trump is now poised to nominate a new justice as soon as he takes office.His nominee would be considered for confirmation by a Republican-controlled Senate under McConnell.Trump may also be able to make further appointments to the court, with three justices 78 or older, including 83-year-old liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whom Trump called on to resign in July after she called him a ""faker"" and speculated about the possibility of moving to New Zealand if he won the White House.Fellow liberal Stephen Breyer is 78, while conservative Anthony Kennedy is 80.If Trump is able to replace Ginsburg or another liberal justice during his presidency, the court's conservative wing would be further strengthened.
Such a majority ""could be a threat to important rights that have been protected in the past by the Supreme Court,"" said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a liberal legal group. She cited abortion rights and efforts at ensuring racial equality as examples.A conservative court, as it was with Scalia on the bench,  would likely be favorable toward gun rights, skeptical of abortion and supportive of the death penalty. If Democrat Hillary Clinton had won Tuesday's election, liberals may have been emboldened to challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and seek gun restrictions and limits on campaign spending, among other things. TRUMP'S LIST

Trump has already issued a list of 21 judges, mainly federal judges appointed by President George W. Bush and state court judges, he said he would consider to fill Scalia's vacancy. All have conservative credentials on such issues as abortion, birth control and gun rights.The case that could be affected soonest by Trump's win  involves transgender rights. The court on Oct. 28 took up a case concerning a female-born transgender high school student named Gavin Grimm, who identifies as male and sued in 2015 to win the right to use the school's boys' bathroom. Grimm is backed by the Obama administration.No date has been set for the argument in the case. The court could potentially delay acting until it has nine justices.A ruling could resolve similar litigation around the country over an Obama administration directive saying schools should allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their choosing.Trump has said he would rescind the Obama directive. He also has said he would rescind Obama's executive action to protect millions of immigrants in the country illegally from deportation and give them work permits, which was put on hold by the courts while the administration fights to revive it.Trump would be expected to overturn major regulations put in place under Obama, including the Clean Power Plan to curb greenhouse emissions mainly from coal-fired power plants. That process takes time, meaning the Supreme Court could potentially rule on a legal challenge to the Clean Power Plan before Trump can dump it. The case is pending before an appeals court in Washington.The Republican Congress under Trump could now seek to repeal Obama's signature healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act, but even if it does not, a Republican legal challenge that could cripple the law is pending before a federal appeals court in Washington.

| WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory's campaign criticized his Democratic challenger on Wednesday for claiming victory in the state's neck-and-neck gubernatorial race, saying tens of thousands of votes had yet to be tallied.Roy Cooper, the state's attorney general, declared victory after unofficial election results showed him leading the Republican incumbent by fewer than 5,000 votes in the largest of the 12 U.S. states that elected governors on Tuesday.If Cooper's advantage holds, it would be the only governorship pick-up for Democrats nationally, while Republicans extended their dominance over state executive offices by flipping seats in New Hampshire, Missouri and Vermont.McCrory's campaign, however, said the outcome of the North Carolina race will not be known until outstanding absentee, military and provisional ballots are counted, a process expected to extend into next week.""Claiming an outcome before the process has concluded is irresponsible and disrespectful to the voters of North Carolina whose voices have yet to be heard,"" McCrory campaign strategist Chris LaCivita said in a statement.
The campaign and state Republican Party signaled that a legal fight could be ahead, calling into question why some 90,000 early votes in heavily Democratic Durham County were not uploaded until late Tuesday.LaCivita said Republicans had ""grave concerns over potential irregularities"" in that county. North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Robin Hayes said dozens of lawyers would be deployed across the state to ensure the validity of every vote cast.Democrats said they expected Cooper to maintain his lead.
""Last night, the people of North Carolina chose a new governor with new priorities,"" Cooper's campaign spokesman Ford Porter said.The race in North Carolina was seen as effectively serving as a referendum on a state law that bans transgender people from using government-run restrooms that correspond with their gender identity and limits protections for gays and lesbians.McCrory signed the law, known as House Bill 2, and steadfastly supported its bathroom provision despite the economic backlash against the state after it passed in March.
Cooper called the measure discriminatory and said it should be repealed.County elections boards will certify Tuesday's results on Nov. 18, state election officials said. If the race is decided by 10,000 or fewer votes, a candidate may request a recount. (Reporting by Colleen Jenkins; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"

By Andrew Osborn and Christian Lowe
| MOSCOW

MOSCOW For all their mutual praise, Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump are likely to disagree on many things.But Trump's election win could hand Moscow an elusive prize - the lifting or easing of Western sanctions.Rolling back those sanctions, imposed by the United States and the European Union to punish Moscow for its 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, could spur investment in Russia's flat-lining economy.That might make it even easier for Putin, who is trying to plug holes in the state budget inflicted by low oil prices and sanctions, to win a fourth presidential term in 2018 by allowing him to show he has returned the economy to growth. ""Clearly the chances of sanctions being lifted on Russia have risen substantially,"" Charles Robertson, Renaissance Capital's global chief economist, said. ""That would improve the investment climate for Russia.""Russia's rouble currency and stocks gained on the Trump election victory. Ukraine's dollar-denominated bonds tumbled to multi-month lows, reflecting pessimism about what a Trump presidency means for the divided and indebted country.The Kremlin had been bracing for fraught relations if the White House had been won by Hillary Clinton - a politician Putin once accused of stirring up protests against him and who state media portrayed as an anti-Russian warmonger.Trump was portrayed in a more positive light. Putin described him as ""very talented"" and in Kremlin-backed media he was cast as a plucky political maverick.Still, few in Moscow had believed the Republican candidate would win, apart from a group of Trump-supporting nationalists who gathered in a Moscow bar decorated with a triptych of Putin, Trump and French Front National leader Marine Le Pen.Once it became clear he had won, Russia's parliament erupted in applause and Putin told foreign ambassadors he was ready to fully restore ties with Washington.State TV ran a clip of a Russian doppelganger of Trump taunting a cowed Clinton lookalike and Margarita Simonyan, the boss of RT, the Kremlin's English-language TV news channel, said she would drive around Moscow with a U.S. flag to celebrate.But Russian glee was tempered by a recognition that Trump's pre-election promises might be diluted and that deep contradictions between Moscow and Washington would remain, even if Trump and Putin adopt a friendly tone in public.EASING SANCTIONS
Trump's attempts to ease restrictions on doing business with Russia could also be constrained by Congress, which has shown it has little patience for the Kremlin's military adventures.
Executives with Western firms say the biggest obstacle to deals with Russia is not the sanctions themselves but the prospect that more could be imposed and the zeal with which existing sanctions are enforced.If a Trump White House were to send a signal to businesses that it was taking a more lax approach, investments could start flowing again with sanctions still in place.A softer U.S. stance could also weaken European sanctions resolve.The bloc's measures have already started to look wobbly, with some member states finding ways to circumvent them, others saying it is time to discuss moving on, and some business groups in countries such as Germany lobbying against them.Until now, Washington has helped stiffen European resolve. When Russia placed a Eurobond in May this year, many European banks decided not to take part because they did not want to fall foul of U.S. financial regulators.""America was the leader there and amazingly has been able to hold Europe together (on sanctions),"" political analyst Masha Lipman told Reuters. ""With Donald Trump in the White House I think there may be changes, something that might be beneficial for Russia.""Putin needs sanctions lifted as they risk hurting his re-election prospects.
Russia's central bank is forecasting economic growth of up to 1 percent next year, well below the level Russian households have come to expect. After previous slumps, recoveries have been driven by foreign lending and investment.There are already some signs that the economy is hurting support for Putin, a trend that is only likely to grow in the 18 months until the Russian presidential election.HARD BARGAIN
Kremlin-watchers said that, even if U.S.-relations were less antagonistic with Trump in the White House, any deal would involve hard bargaining on both sides.Russia is seeking formal recognition from the world that Crimea, part of Ukraine, is now Russian territory, something it has only got so far apart from a handful of nations. It also wants Kiev to do more to implement a peace deal covering eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists hold sway.In Syria, where Russia is helping President Bashar al-Assad fight a war with air strikes and military assistance, Moscow wants the West to drop ideas about changing the government, abandon help for what it says are hardline Islamists, and drop talk of possible no-fly zones.One possibility is a quid pro quo, with Russia making concessions on Syria in exchange for the United States ceding ground on Ukraine and sanctions.
""For Russia the key point is Ukraine. If Trump says that America does not care about Ukraine, then that is all that Russia wants to hear right now,"" Georgy Bovt, editor of the Russkiy Mir magazine, told Reuters.""On Syria it will be easier to reach a deal. I think that on Assad, Russia will be willing to compromise because Ukraine is more important for Russia.""PERSONALITIES
Much has been made in Russian and Western media of the perceived similarities and differences between Putin and Trump, who have never met.Both are fond of tough talking and some Russian politicians have suggested the pair might be able to forge a close working relationship similar to the one the Russian leader enjoyed with former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Trump has said he might even meet Putin before his inauguration. Putin's spokesman said there were currently no plans for such a meeting.  People familiar with both men's leadership styles advised caution however, saying both were relatively thin-skinned when it came to criticism.Andrey Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a think-tank close to the Foreign Ministry, told Reuters the fact that Trump was an untested politician would also be a worry for the Kremlin.""He's a loose cannon and you never know what to expect from him,"" he said.There were also concerns the two men might be too alike. ""The problem is that both of them, Putin and Trump, are macho,"" Sergei Markov, a Kremlin-connected analyst and former pro-Putin lawmaker, told Reuters. ""They could try to take the measure of each other. We can't let that happen.""

| MARRAKESH, Morocco/CHICAGO

MARRAKESH, Morocco/CHICAGO The prospect of an abrupt shift in U.S. climate policy under President-elect Donald Trump lifted the shares of U.S. mining equipment giant Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), North American railroads and other companies tied to fossil fuels, and slammed shares of renewable energy firms.Trump has called climate change a hoax, said he would rip up the Paris climate treaty and promised to revive the U.S. coal sector. His victory caused dismay at a climate policy conference in Morocco on Wednesday.In the United States, the prospect of a sharp turn in U.S. environmental policy helped boost Caterpillar shares by more than 7 percent on Wednesday on hopes that a Trump administration would reinvigorate coal mining and investment in infrastructure. A mining slump has depressed Caterpillar's profits and forced rounds of layoffs.   The Obama administration has pursued emissions rules designed to discourage coal-fired power plants, while Trump has said he would revive the coal industry and roll back regulation.""There is bountiful evidence that free trade, tax reform, infrastructure investment and smart regulation are critically important to manufacturers' success,"" Caterpillar said in a statement. Shares in farm and equipment maker Deere & Co (DE.N) and truck makers Paccar Inc (PCAR.O) and Navistar International Corp (NAV.N) also rose, as did oil stocks. Railroads Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC.N) and Union Pacific Corp rose 3.3 percent and 4 percent respectively. U.S. railroads have suffered as coal shipments have declined. ""Obviously this is good news for fossil energy and coal in particularly,"" said National Mining Association spokesperson Luke Popovich. ""We will have a profound shift in policy. And hopefully spur development in low emission and higher efficiency technologies which make coal cleaner to use."" 
Regulation and federal policies are not the only challenge for coal. ""A new administration may result in less regulatory pressure for utilities, the competition offered by natural gas doesn't change,"" said Michael Trevino, spokesman for No. 2 U.S. railroad BNSF, which is owned by Berkshire Hathaway Inc(BRKa.N).

Trump's victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton cast a dark cloud over delegates attending a 200-nation meeting in Marrakesh being held from Nov. 7-18 to celebrate the start of the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming last Friday. Some delegates expressed concern that Trump could cause other nations to reconsider their position on global warming. Trump has said climate change was an invention by China and wants instead to promote jobs in the U.S. fossil fuel industry.""We will have a lot more hurdles,"" said Ian Fry, head of the delegation of Tuvalu, a Pacific island state which fears rising sea levels, adding Trump's victory could have a ""domino effect on other nations"".The Paris Agreement allows all nations to set national targets to slow climate change and some could scale those back. There are no sanctions for non-compliance. Many nations vowed to push ahead despite Trump with the sweeping plan to phase out net global greenhouse gas emissions between 2050 and 2100 by shifting from coal and oil to cleaner energies such as wind or solar power.
Still, Trump's victory drove down renewable energy stocks. Shares in Vestas (VWS.CO), the world's biggest wind turbine maker, were down 6.2 percent in mid-morning, while German peer Nordex (NDXG.DE) traded 6.6 percent lower.In the United States, Silicon Valley electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc(TSLA.O) sank 3.4 percent to its lowest price since February. Tesla benefits from federal tax breaks for electric vehicles and selling credits generated under a California electric vehicle policy.Other renewable shares were also hit. Spain's Gamesa (GAM.MC), which is being merged with Siemens (SIEGn.DE), and Portugal's EDP Renovaveis (EDPR.LS) traded 2.4 and 5.2 percent lower, respectively.Stephanie Pfeifer, CEO of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, a European forum for 128 investors with more than 13 trillion euros in assets, said changes towards greener growth were ""irreversible"".""Renewables have already overtaken coal as a global power source, electric vehicles are the growth segment of the auto industry and jobs are being created in clean energy sectors faster than any other,"" she said.
