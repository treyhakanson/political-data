NEW YORK Donald Trump appeared to change tack on Tuesday about his future ties with British Prime Minister David Cameron, saying he expects them to have ""a good relationship"" if he becomes the U.S. president, after predicting the opposite in an interview aired just the day before in response to criticism from the UK leader.""He's got plenty of problems, and I think he was inappropriate. So that's fine. ... I'm sure I'll have a good relationship with him,"" Trump told Reuters in an interview.On Monday, in an interview broadcast on Britain's ITV television station, Trump said, ""It looks like we're not going to have a very good relationship, who knows?"" when asked how ties would fare if he won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8.
Cameron criticized Trump in the British parliament over his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, calling him ""divisive, stupid and wrong."" The prime minister suggested that the New York billionaire, who is now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, would unite Britain against him if he visited.
Asked which foreign leader he would like to meet first, Trump told Reuters: ""I have no preference in terms of timing. I'll meet them, we'll have a better relationship with foreign countries than we have right now. We don't have a good relationship. Every one of them rips us off but we still don't have a good relationship.""

By Emily Flitter and Steve Holland
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Tuesday that sweeping financial reforms put in place under President Barack Obama were harming the economy and he would dismantle nearly all of them.Trump told Reuters in an interview that he would release a plan in about two weeks for overhauling the 2010 financial regulatory law known as Dodd-Frank.""Dodd-Frank has made it impossible for bankers to function,"" the presumptive Republican nominee said. ""It makes it very hard for bankers to loan money for people to create jobs, for people with businesses to create jobs. And that has to stop.""Pressed on the extent of the changes he wanted to make, Trump said, ""it will be close to dismantling of Dodd-Frank.""Reacting on Twitter to Trump's comment, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton called it a ""reckless idea"" that would ""leave middle-class families out to dry.""Dodd-Frank, passed in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, forced U.S. banks to reduce their reliance on debt for funding and to craft ""living wills,"" or blueprints for winding them down in a crisis.The law created a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to oversee consumer financial products such as mortgages and gave regulators new powers over large non-bank financial companies.
INDUSTRY PRESSES FOR TWEAKS
Republicans in Congress have pushed to ease the requirements on small- and medium-sized banks and to make it more difficult for regulators to introduce new rules. They have also argued for getting rid of the consumer financial protection agency.Banks and other financial firms have spent six years and millions of dollars adjusting their operations to comply with the law. Bank lobbyists have generally pushed for changes to make complying easier, rather than a wholesale rewrite.
""Every law can be improved, and Dodd-Frank is no exception. Sometimes there are drafting errors. Sometimes a good idea in theory turns out to be unworkable after a closer look in the light of day,"" said John Hall, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association.Alison Hawkins, a spokesman for the Financial Services Roundtable, a Washington-based financial industry trade group, said the group wanted to know more about Trump's plan, and added ""some fixes to Dodd-Frank will benefit consumers and the economy.""On Capitol Hill, Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, plans to release his own financial regulation plan in the coming weeks, according to his spokeswoman, Sarah Rozier.""Mr. Trump is right, Dodd-Frank isn't working,"" Rozier said. She added that Hensarling, who has endorsed Trump, has not discussed his plan with any of the presidential candidates.
But Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets, a group that favors tighter regulation of Wall Street, said Trump's plan would be ""a slap in the face to the American people who have suffered so much from the 2008 crash.""Trump declined to offer specifics on his plan, but said it would address whether institutions should separate commercial banking activities from investment banking. He said even under the new plan, the banking system would not be perfect. ""Will there be bad loans made? Yes. But there are bad loans made now with Dodd-Frank,"" Trump said.Trump was reluctant to discuss specifics on his ideas for the economy before his upcoming speech, but he praised Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen, saying he approved of her decision to keep interest rates low. Trump has said in the past he would replace Yellen once her term as Fed chair ended.""I'm not a person that thinks Janet Yellen is doing a bad job,"" he told Reuters. ""I would rather have a Republican in the position but I am not the enemy of Janet Yellen.""

WASHINGTON Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton on Tuesday released her personal financial disclosure form, covering Jan. 1, 2015, to the present, with a call to Republican Donald Trump to make available his income tax returns.   ""The true test for Donald Trump is whether he will adhere to the precedent followed by every presidential candidate in the modern era and make his tax returns available, as Hillary Clinton has done,"" spokeswoman Christina Reynolds said in a statement. Clinton's own disclosure form showed more than $5 million in royalties from her memoir ""Hard Choices.""
Trump earlier in the day announced that he had filed his personal financial disclosure to the Federal Election Commission on Monday.

WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate unanimously backed President Barack Obama's nomination of Eric Fanning as secretary of the Army on Tuesday, making him the first openly gay leader of a U.S. military service branch.Fanning was previously undersecretary of the Air Force and chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter.Fanning was confirmed by unanimous voice vote, eight months following his nomination, after Senator Pat Roberts said Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work told him that it was now too late for the administration to transfer prisoners from the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to Roberts' home state, Kansas.Work did not confirm Roberts' account of that conversation, saying that no option was off the table.""I explained to Senator Roberts that we are trying to achieve the goal of closure with the support of Congress and we recognize that there is limited time left to achieve that support, both in terms of lifting Congressional restrictions and winning approval of funds to execute closure,"" Work said in a statement. Roberts had held up Fanning's nomination for months to  underscore his opposition to any possible transfer of detainees.
His opposition had frustrated fellow Republican John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a strong supporter of Fanning's nomination.On Tuesday, McCain and Roberts appeared in the Senate together as Roberts announced that he had released his ""hold"" on Fanning and spoken to Fanning.McCain noted that this year's National Defense Authorization Act ensures that the Obama administration does not have the authority to release or transfer Guantanamo detainees to the U.S. mainland.
Roberts said Work told him during a meeting last week that he would be unable to fulfill an order to move Guantanamo detainees to the United States before Obama leaves office in January 2017.""The clock has run out for the president,"" Roberts said.

WASHINGTON An aide to U.S. Democrat Hillary Clinton criticized Donald Trump's foreign policy as making ""no sense for the rest of us"" after the Republican presidential candidate said he would hold talks with North Korea's Kim Jong Un. ""Let me get this straight: Donald Trump insults the leader of our closest ally, then turns around and says he'd love to talk to Kim Jong Un?"" senior foreign policy adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement. ""I suppose that makes sense for him, since he also praised Kim Jong Un for executing his uncle and seems to have a bizarre fascination with foreign strongmen like Putin and Kim. His approach to foreign policy makes no sense for the rest of us.""

By Karen Freifeld
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK A New York appeals court issued a ruling on Tuesday that apparently made it highly unlikely that a state fraud case against Trump University, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's venture, will be heard before the Nov. 8 general election.The mid-level appeals court ruled that Trump's lawyers can argue to the state's highest court that the fraud claims against Trump University brought by the state attorney general should be dismissed. Trump suffered a legal setback in the case in March when the appeals court allowed multimillion-dollar fraud claims against the now-defunct venture to proceed. The claims are part of a state lawsuit filed in 2013 that accuses Trump University of misleading thousands of people who paid up to $35,000 for seminars to learn the billionaire businessman's real estate investment strategies.The trial judge in the case had been waiting to hear whether the mid-level appeals court, the Appellate Division, First Department, in Manhattan, would give Trump permission to go to the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals.
""It's no surprise that Donald Trump is using every legal option to avoid standing trial for operating a sham for-profit university,"" New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement responding to the ruling. ""As our lawsuit makes clear, Mr. Trump's phony university defrauded thousands of students through an illicit scheme that cost them millions of dollars,"" Schneiderman continued. ""I am confident that the Court of Appeals will agree with the lower court's unanimous decision to reject virtually all of Mr. Trump's claims.""Alan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization, said, ""We are pleased with the court's decision and look forward to going to the Court of Appeals.""
Garten has said the claims are ""without merit and baseless"" and that almost all those who participated in the programs filled out written surveys giving the seminars high ratings.Class actions are pending in California on similar claims by Trump University students. One of those cases is scheduled for trial on Nov. 28.The fraud claims against Trump University were an issue early in the Republican primary campaign. 
With Trump allowed to appeal the pretrial rulings to the state's highest court, it is very unlikely the New York case will be resolved before November's election.It takes an average of 12 months from the time an appeal is allowed for the Court of Appeals to hear oral arguments in a case, according to court spokesman Gary Spencer. A decision on whether or not the fraud claims can proceed would normally take another month and, if not dismissed, the case would then go back to the trial court. In the March decision, Schneiderman was allowed to proceed on fraud claims that require proof of intent to defraud and those that do not. The court also ruled that the statute of limitations for the claims stretches back to 2007 instead of 2010. The program stopped taking students in 2010.

By Ginger Gibson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Donald Trump has filed a new personal financial disclosure form that details a net worth of more than $10 billion, the Republican presidential candidate's campaign said on Tuesday.The party's presumptive nominee has refused so far to release his income tax statements, which are normally released by presidential candidates. That decision has drawn criticism from likely Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. 
The personal disclosure form is identical to one Trump filed shortly after announcing his candidacy last year. Critics have said the billionaire real estate developer is inflating his net worth in the forms and that his tax documents would provide a more accurate depiction of how much money he has.
""I have built an incredible company and have accumulated one of the greatest portfolios of real estate assets, many of which are considered to be among the finest and most iconic properties in the world,"" Trump said in a statement about his disclosure.

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The House of Representatives stripped a requirement that women register for the military draft from a sweeping annual defense policy bill on Tuesday, but supporters of the provision said they would keep pushing for its passage.Democrats accused the committee's Republican leaders of using an underhanded ploy to undercut the House Armed Services Committee, which had approved the amendment, and avoid what could be a difficult vote for some party members.""They don't want to subject their members to a vote on equality for women,"" Representative Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, told reporters.Republican Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said the amendment was removed because it violated House budget rules due to the cost of  registering women. He said it was replaced with an amendment calling for a broad review of the Selective Service.The House Rules Committee set up removal of the amendment from the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, during a meeting late on Monday. It was taken out of the bill via a procedural vote on Tuesday afternoon.
But the effort is not dead. The Senate Armed Services Committee included a similar amendment in its version of the NDAA, and it has bipartisan support in the Senate.The Senate's Republican Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, said he believed women should register, although he did not expect the country to reinstate the draft.
""Given where we are today with women in the military performing virtually all kinds of functions, I personally think it would be appropriate for them to register just like men do,"" McConnell told a news conference.Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced last year that all combat positions would be open to women, which immediately prompted calls that women also should be required to register. That worried some social conservatives uncomfortable with the blurring of men's and women's traditional roles in society.The U.S. military has been an all-volunteer force since the 1970s, but young men have been required to sign up for the Selective Service in case the draft is reactivated.    
To become law as part of the NDAA, a version of the defense bill with the amendment would have to be approved by the full House and Senate, and signed by President Barack Obama. (Additional reporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Dan Grebler)"	['McConnell', 'Obama']	[]
9	9	http://reuters.com/article/us-philippines-politics-usa-obama-idUSKCN0Y82BZ	Obama speaks to Philippines' president-elect, stresses human rights	"

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama called incoming Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday to congratulate him on his election win, stressing that their countries' alliance was based on a commitment to human rights and the rule of law, the White House said.U.S. officials have signaled that Washington is ready to work with Duterte despite allegations of human rights abuses in the city he led as mayor for over two decades.Obama's deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, told a Washington seminar earlier on Tuesday that the U.S. administration was aware there was some ""controversy"" surrounding Duterte and ""statements that drew attention in the past,"" but he did not elaborate.Obama offered his congratulations to Duterte as the ""presumptive president-elect.""He won the largest share of the votes in a May 9 presidential election, according to an unofficial count by a poll watchdog, although the official result has yet to be confirmed.Obama ""highlighted the enduring values that underpin our thriving alliance ... and the longstanding ties between our two peoples, including our shared commitments to democracy, human rights, rule of law, and inclusive economic growth,"" the White House said.
Washington hoped ""to build on progress made with the last administration"" in the Philippines, Rhodes said.""This is a new government and we'll want to hear from them directly what their priorities are,"" he said when asked about the election, adding that Washington wanted to see continued efforts to respect the rule of law and combat corruption.Duterte has been criticized for allowing a spree of vigilante killings under his administration in Davao city, and critics fear he could let them happen on a larger scale as president.
He has denied ordering any of the killings, but has not condemned them.Washington has steered clear of the controversy, however, which analysts say reflects the reality of U.S. national security interests given China's increasingly assertive stance in Asia and maritime disputes in the South China Sea.Duterte's vows to restore law and order resonated with voters, but his incendiary rhetoric and advocacy of extrajudicial killings to stamp out crime and drugs have alarmed many people.
Rhodes noted U.S. support for Manila efforts to resolve its territorial dispute with China in the South China Sea through international arbitration, and a recent deal allowing a greater U.S. military presence in the Philippines. ""We believe that now as much as ever it's important that the U.S. and Philippines are seen working together,"" he said.The U.S. stance on Duterte could echo its approach toward India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi. At one point, Modi was unable to obtain a U.S. visa because of concerns about sectarian riots in the state of Gujarat when he was chief minister, but was later invited to the White House when he became prime minister.
