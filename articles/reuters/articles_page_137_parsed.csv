By David Morgan and Ayesha Rascoe
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama on Thursday said it was time for Congress to lay aside politics and to act to provide additional money to combat the Zika virus before government funding dries up.""Our experts at the CDC, the folks on the front lines have been doing their best in making due by moving funds from other areas, but now the money we need to fight Zika is rapidly running out,"" Obama said at a press conference at the Pentagon.He warned that development of a vaccine for the virus could be delayed if Congress does not provide any more money and urged Americans to contact lawmakers to pressure them to take up the issue.Concern over the threat from Zika, which can cause a birth defect called microcephaly marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies, has risen since Florida authorities last week detected the first signs of local transmission in the continental United States.Zika funding remains stalled six months after Obama asked the Republican-led Congress to approve $1.9 billion in emergency funds.
Forty-one Democratic U.S. senators on Thursday sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan urging them to summon lawmakers back from their summer recess to vote on emergency funding to fight the virus.But, Ryan accused Democrats of obstructing the funding and said the Obama administration has failed to spend existing funds to prevent the spread of the mosquito-borne virus.Congress has interrupted its own recesses at least eight times since 1998, most recently in 2013 when lawmakers returned early to debate the use of military force in Syria, according to congressional records.
The latest round of finger-pointing indicated there was little chance lawmakers would cut short their seven-week summer break to vote on Zika funding.A $1.1 billion compromise failed after House Republicans attached language that would place restrictions on abortion and defund part of Obama's signature 2010 healthcare law.
Senate Democrats, who blocked the measure twice before Congress left Washington last month, want Republicans to agree on a new funding measure that drops those provisions, a step Republicans reject.""We need the White House and Senate Democrats to drop politics and put the public's health first. We hope for a change of heart, and soon,"" Ryan wrote in an opinion piece in the USA Today newspaper.McConnell spokesman Don Stewart invited Democrats to allow the current bill to pass by unanimous consent at a perfunctory session on Friday.

By Steve Holland and Emily Stephenson
| DETROIT/WASHINGTON

DETROIT/WASHINGTON Republican Donald Trump sought to regain momentum for his White House campaign on Monday by proposing sweeping tax breaks, cuts to federal regulations and a revival of the stalled Keystone XL oil pipeline project.The New York businessman used a speech on the economy in Detroit to try to turn the page after a week of missteps in which he came under heavy criticism, including from some in his own party, and rival Democrat Hillary Clinton surged ahead in opinion polls three months ahead of the Nov. 8 election.""I want to jump-start America,"" Trump said, ""and it won't even be that hard.""Trump stuck to prepared remarks rather than the freewheeling style that often produces controversial comments at rallies. He kept his cool as some 14 protesters jumped to their feet and shouted at coordinated intervals as he spoke at the Detroit Economic Club. Trump's remarks, which were repeatedly cheered by the crowd, appeared targeted at both an affluent business community and working people, in particular those who have suffered from a decline in U.S. manufacturing in cities such as Detroit. He dismissed Clinton as representing ""the tired voices of the past."" ""We now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for America,"" Trump said. ""It's a conversation about how to make America great again for everyone ... especially for those who have the very least.""Much of the speech reflected Republican talking points and critics said his proposals lacked detail. But Republican operatives and others who saw the speech praised Trump for turning his focus to policy and contrasting his ideas with Clinton's.The question for Trump now is whether he will be able to keep his campaign on message as Republicans want him to do.Trump pitched a tax plan that mirrored traditional Republican thinking that lowering taxes and slashing regulation generates economic growth and jobs. He proposed lowering individual and corporate rates and a discounted 10 percent levy for businesses that bring back profits held overseas.Trump's plan to create new tax deductions for childcare costs raised questions from economists about whether lower-income families would benefit. Many Republicans remain frustrated with his trade vision, which bucks party orthodoxy by calling for a rewrite of major agreements.""My response is good, bad and ugly,"" said Lanhee Chen, who was policy director for the 2012 presidential campaign of Republican Mitt Romney.""I think the trade position remains pretty ugly,"" he said. ""But I understand why they did it. I think it's a strong effort, at least, to meld elements of conservative economic policy with Trump's more populist thinking.""
SHIFT FOCUS
Trump's effort to shift focus came after what was widely seen as the worst week of his campaign, in which he sparred with party leaders and got entangled in a dispute with the parents of a Muslim U.S. soldier who was killed in the Iraq war.Republican Senator Susan Collins added her name on Monday to a growing list of Republican lawmakers who say they will not vote for Trump.Some frustrated Republicans plan to back a conservative alternative, former CIA officer Evan McMullin.On Monday, Trump waited for the frequent disruptions by protesters to end, smiling and refraining from his practice at campaign rallies of asking security to ""get them out of here.""A group called the Michigan People's Campaign took credit for the protests, which they said were aimed at Trump's recent comments about sexual harassment.
Clinton will outline her economic vision in Michigan on Thursday. In a statement issued before Trump's speech, her campaign said his plan would give tax breaks to the wealthy and big companies and would hurt working families. At a rally on Monday in St. Petersburg, Florida, she derided a list of economic advisers Trump released last week as ""six guys named Steve.""""Now, they tried to make his old, tired ideas sound new,"" Clinton said. ""He wants to basically just repackage trickle-down economics.""MORE DETAILS PLEASE
Trump's rough week took its toll in opinion polls. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released on Sunday gave Clinton an eight-point lead, 50 percent to 42 percent. Trump, a real estate developer who has never held elected public office, touts his practical experience and potential to create jobs, blaming President Barack Obama for what he calls a weak recovery from the economic recession. On Monday, he said Clinton would rely on policies that have not worked.
""She is the candidate of the past,"" Trump said. ""Ours is the campaign of the future.""Reaction from the crowd in Detroit was mixed. ""I think he laid out a good bullet point on how he's going to solve the economic problems with his trade policies,"" said insurance executive Sal Giammursta.Others wanted more details. ""People were looking for more substance,"" said lawyer Al Rogalski.Trump called for a temporary moratorium on new regulations and repeated his pledges to rewrite the landmark North American trade deal that President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton's husband, signed in 1994, and to withdraw from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership deal backed by Obama.But much of the reaction was to Trump's tax plan. He again proposed lowering the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from the current 35 percent. And he proposed lowering income-based individual tax brackets to 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent.In 2015, Trump proposed a lower top rate of 25 percent. After criticism from budget experts who said such low rates would balloon deficits, he tweaked his proposal to be more in line with policies supported by Republicans in Congress.""It's encouraging that Donald Trump appears to be modifying his tax plan,"" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the anti-debt Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.The research group Tax Policy Center estimated in December that Trump's original plan would reduce federal tax revenues by $9.5 trillion in the first decade. Steve Moore, an adviser to Trump, said the campaign believes it has made changes to bring the plan's cost down to $2 trillion to $3 trillion. A campaign aide said Trump would give more detail in a later speech. (Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Paul Tait)"	['Romney', 'Paul', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

By Jonathan Landay
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Fifty prominent Republican national security officials, including a former CIA director, on Monday called party nominee Donald Trump unqualified to lead the country and said he would be ""the most reckless president in American history.""The statement was the latest repudiation of Trump's candidacy by veteran Republican national security specialists, and was remarkable for the harshness of its language.""Mr. Trump lacks the character, values, and experience to be president. He weakens U.S. moral authority as the leader of the free world. He appears to lack basic knowledge about and belief in the U.S. Constitution, U.S. laws and U.S. institutions, including religious tolerance, freedom of the press, and an independent judiciary,"" the statement said.""None of us will vote for Donald Trump,"" said the statement, which noted that some signatories also have doubts about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.""From a foreign policy perspective, Donald Trump is not qualified to be president and commander in chief,"" said the statement, which was first reported in the New York Times. ""Indeed, we are convinced that he would be a dangerous president and would put at risk our country's national security and well-being.""The signatories, some of whom worked for more than one Republican president, included former Central Intelligence Agency Director Michael Hayden, who also headed the National Security Agency; former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff; former Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte; and two former U.S. trade representatives, Carla Hills and Robert Zoelick.Other signatories included former senior State Department, Pentagon and National Security Council officials who helped plan and oversee the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. Trump has harshly criticized the Iraq operation, although when radio host Howard Stern asked him in 2002 if he favored invading Iraq, Trump said he guessed he did.
The statement was organized by Philip Zelikow, who served as a top adviser to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.Trump responded with a statement deriding the signatories as members of ""the failed Washington elite"" who ""deserve the blame for making the world such a dangerous place.""""These insiders - along with Hillary Clinton - are the owners of the disastrous decisions to invade Iraq, allow Americans to die in Benghazi, and they are the ones who allowed the rise of ISIS,"" he continued, using an acronym for the Islamic State militant group.RESPONSE TO TRUMP'S REMARKS

The statement did not cite specific comments by Trump, but it clearly was a response to a series of remarks he has made questioning the need for NATO, expressing admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling for a temporary ban on immigration by Muslims, and inviting Russia to hack Clinton's private email server - which he later said was a joke.Many of the signatories had declined to sign an open letter disputing Trump's national security qualifications that was published in March.The statement said many Americans are frustrated with the federal government's failure to solve domestic and international problems.
""But Donald Trump is not the answer to America's daunting challenges and to this crucial election,"" the statement said. ""We are convinced that in the Oval Office, he would be the most reckless President in American history.Some Democratic foreign policy experts called the statement a reminder of the divisions the New York real estate developer's nomination has sown within the Republican Party.""This letter is signed by those who remain in the internationalist wing of the party - many were former advisors to candidates who lost the primary fight to Trump,"" said Brian Katulis, a fellow at the Center for American Progress and a Clinton campaign adviser.""Calling Trump unqualified to be commander in chief is tough, but also asserting that he's lacking in character and understanding of our basic values is really pretty amazing,"" said Tommy Vietor, a former National Security Council spokesman in Democratic President Barack Obama's administration. ""That said, I think it's unlikely to influence many voters, but it could give cover to Republican members of Congress and donors who want to cut the cord and move on from Trump.""(For the complete statement go to: here) (Reporting by Jonathan Landay; Additional reporting by Jim Oliphant; Editing by John Walcott and Jonathan Oatis)"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

By Dave McKinney
| CHICAGO

CHICAGO A vanquished challenger to Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan filed a federal lawsuit on Monday against the longtime Democratic leader, accusing him of using dirty tactics to beat him in a March primary election.Chicago Democrat Jason Gonzales accused Madigan of defaming him and crowding the primary with ""phony"" candidates to dilute his opposition.Gonzalez named the 45-year incumbent, the speaker's political funds, a top aide and his two other opponents, among others, in a 39-count lawsuit over an alleged scheme to swing the four-way race in the speaker's favor. ""Madigan won because he engaged in dirty, illegal, fraudulent tactics,"" Gonzales, who finished second in his bid to topple Madigan with 27 percent of the vote, said in a telephone interview. Madigan received slightly more than 65 percent.Madigan said in a statement that the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago, was ""without merit."" 
""Voters of my district soundly re-nominated me based on my strong record of service, giving me more than 65 percent of the vote, and they emphatically rejected Jason Gonzales because they knew he couldn't be trusted,"" said Madigan, who is Illinois' longest-serving officeholder, representing Chicago's southwest side since 1971.Neither Grasiela Rodriguez nor Joe Barboza, the two other candidates named in Gonzales' lawsuit, could be reached for comment.Gonzales accused Madigan of falsely calling him a felon on television commercials and in political mailers based on several arrests and criminal convictions between 1991 and 1994, including the use of stolen credit cards as an 18-year-old.
Gonzales alleged that Madigan improperly publicized those criminal records, which should not have been made public after former Democratic Governor Pat Quinn granted a pardon and expunged Gonzales' criminal record in January 2015.""Madigan's defamatory statement was one that harmed Gonzales' reputation to the extent it lowered Gonzales in the eyes of the community and deterred the community from associating with him,"" his lawsuit alleged.""As a direct and proximate result of the foregoing acts and/or omissions by Madigan, Gonzales suffered injuries of a personal and pecuniary nature, including emotional distress, damage to reputation and further punishment despite being granted full pardons,"" the lawsuit said.
Gonzales also accused Madigan and his aides of diluting the Hispanic vote in a legislative district that is about 70 percent Latino by planting two opponents with Hispanic surnames on the ballot. Neither of the candidates, who collectively received nearly 8 percent of the vote, actively campaigned.Gonzales' case is being handled by Tony Peraica, a former Republican member of the Cook County board.""I couldn't find a Democratic lawyer who was wiling to take the case,"" Gonzalez told Reuters. ""Everybody was scared of Madigan."" (Reporting by Dave McKinney; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"	['Cook']	[]
6	6	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-republicans-mcmullin-idUSKCN10J1IN	A disenchanted Republican, fearing Trump, launches third-party run	"


By Ginger Gibson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A former CIA officer and congressional staffer on Monday launched a long-shot bid for president, a Republican billing himself as a conservative alternative to Donald Trump who disenchanted voters can rally around.There is virtually no chance that the newly announced candidate, Evan McMullin, could win and only a slight chance he will even be able to get his name on the ballots of key states. McMullin has no name recognition across the country and was not even well known in the Capitol where until Monday he was the chief policy director for the organizational body of all Republicans in the House of Representatives.But that will not stop some conservatives from pitching him as an option in the Nov. 8 election for those who never warmed to Trump and remain adamantly opposed to Democrat Hillary Clinton.""Donald Trump appeals to the worst fears of Americans at a time we need unity, not division,"" McMullin wrote in a letter announcing his candidacy. ""With the stakes so high for our nation and at this late stage in the process, I can no longer stand on the sidelines."" McMullin's campaign was first reported by MSNBC and BuzzFeed. He could not be immediately reached for comment.
Trump was formally anointed his party's nominee last month after beating 16 rivals in the state-by-state primary contests. But many Republicans have been concerned about Trump's policies, such as his proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country, and his free-wheeling, often insulting rhetoric.McMullin has never held public office. In addition to lacking a quick source of campaign cash, he will face immediate hurdles to try to get his name on enough ballot papers to make himself a serious candidate.Texas, for example, requires third-party candidates to get more than 79,000 signatures from residents who did not vote in either the Republican or Democratic primary. And the deadline for that was in early May. 
Deadlines to get on the ballots have also lapsed for North Carolina, Illinois and Florida, all large states that also could be pivotal in the election.The best McMullin could likely hope for would be to simply play spoiler to Trump in a handful of states, eating away at the New York real estate developer's ability to win states that are generally reliably Republican.McMullin would join two other third-party hopefuls - Gary Johnson, who was nominated by the Libertarian Party, and Jill Stein, who will represent the Green Party. In recent polls that included Trump, Clinton, Stein and Trump, the two third-party candidates have both struggled to get above 10 percentage points in the polls.
McMullin, who according to his LinkedIn profile worked in Congress since 2013, has been a frequent critic of Trump on social media, calling him an authoritarian and criticizing his stance on civil rights as well as his refusal to release his tax returns.Prior to working in Congress, McMullin spent 11 years as an operations officer for the Central Intelligence Agency. Trump, meanwhile, was seeking to reset his campaign with a big economy policy speech on Monday after a rough patch last week. He was widely criticized, including by some senior Republicans, for engaging in a public dispute with the parents of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq.

By Lawrence Delevingne
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Billionaire hedge fund manager Seth Klarman said on Wednesday he would work to get Hillary Clinton elected president of the United States because he finds recent comments by Donald Trump ""shockingly unacceptable."" ""His words and actions over the last several days are so shockingly unacceptable in our diverse and democratic society that it is simply unthinkable that Donald Trump could become our president,"" Klarman said of the Republican presidential nominee.The president and chief executive of The Baupost Group told Reuters in an emailed statement that Trump's suggestion ""that the election will be rigged is particularly dangerous."" ""I will continue to find ways to support Hillary Clinton and defeat Donald Trump,"" he said.  On Monday, Trump told a town hall event in Columbus, Ohio, that he thought the November election might be ""rigged."" Trump's attacks on the Muslim parents of a decorated American soldier, Captain Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq, have drawn sharp rebukes since Khizr Khan and Ghazala Khan appeared at last week's Democratic convention.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Klarman, whose Boston-based investment firm manages $29 billion, is registered as an independent voter. But a review of filings showed that his political giving has largely benefited Republicans over the years, including donations this election cycle to political action committees that supported primary candidates Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and Marco Rubio.
He has also given to the campaigns of Democrats, including now-U.S. Senators Cory Booker and Mark Warner, according to the filings. He contributed $4,600 to Hillary Clinton's 2007 presidential race, while also giving to the campaigns of Republicans John McCain and Rudy Giuliani.In June, Klarman gave $5,400 to Clinton's campaign.""He is completely unqualified for the highest office in the land,"" Klarman said in his statement, without specifying how he would further support Clinton.
