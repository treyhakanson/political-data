By Grant Smith and Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump trailed Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by 12 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday, making him the clear underdog ahead of next week's Republican National Convention.Forty-five percent of likely voters supported former Secretary of State Clinton, 33 percent supported Trump, the wealthy businessman, and the remainder supported neither, according to the July 11-15 online poll.The survey showed little change from Tuesday, when Clinton had led Trump by 13 percentage points.Clinton has been ahead in the poll since early January. Trump only approached her level of support in May, after his last two remaining rivals quit the race and he became the presumptive Republican nominee.Trump's favorability has dropped since then, as his campaign began to focus on the Nov. 8 general election.
Trump has faced criticism in recent weeks over his now-defunct Trump University venture, which is accused of making false promises, and over his anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric.The poll results were mostly gathered before Thursday night's deadly truck attack in Nice, France, and before Trump's announcement on Friday that Indiana Governor Mike Pence would be his vice presidential running mate.The poll results suggest that Clinton's use of personal email for government business while secretary of state and her handling of classified information have not damaged her support among likely voters. 
But other polls show a closer race. The CBS News/NY Times telephone poll has the candidates tied at 40 percent each, while a McClatchy/Marist telephone poll has Clinton leading by just 3 percentage points, 42 percent to Trump's 39 percent. 
Trump may get a bump in the polls following next week's convention in Cleveland, where the party is expected to rally behind him as the nominee. In 2012, support for Republican nominee Mitt Romney rose about 5 percentage points following the convention that year. The Democratic convention is set for the following week, opening July 25 in Philadelphia.The Reuters/Ipsos poll surveyed 1,186 likely voters across the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points. (Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Jonathan Oatis)"	['Pence', 'Romney', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Congress on Friday released a long-classified section of the official report on the Sept. 11 attacks describing an array of potential links between some of the hijackers and officials in Saudi Arabia.The 28 pages of the report on the 2002 investigation focus on potential Saudi government ties to the 2001 aircraft attacks on the United States, in which nearly 3,000 people died.The report said the alleged links had not been independently verified.The pages were released by the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee after years of wrangling in Washington between Congress and different administrations, Republicans and Democrats, and urging by families of those killed.""The matter is now finished,"" Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told a news conference in Washington. Asked whether the report exonerated the kingdom, he replied: ""Absolutely.""The release of the previously classified pages is unlikely to end the controversy over the role of Saudi Arabia, an important U.S. partner in the Middle East. Many U.S. officials who opposed their release had worried they would damage diplomatic relations.Fifteen of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers were Saudi citizens.""According to various FBI documents and CIA memorandum, some of the September 11 hijackers, while in the United States, apparently had contacts with individuals who may be connected to the Saudi Government,"" the report said, giving a catalog of alleged links.
They included reported contacts between Saudis in California, money possibly sent from the Saudi royal family to the hijackers and even a statement that a reported Saudi Interior Ministry official stayed at the same Virginia hotel as one hijacker in September 2001.One section said Omar al-Bayoumi, said to be a Saudi intelligence officer, met with two hijackers at a public place after they arrived in San Diego. Citing Federal Bureau of Investigation files, it said his salary rose to $3,700 a month from $465 two months after two of the hijackers arrived in California.Another described how two of the hijackers asked flight attendants technical questions during a trip in 1999 from Phoenix to Washington to attend a party at the Saudi embassy. One tried twice to enter the cockpit. The plane made an emergency landing and the FBI investigated, but did not prosecute.The newly declassified pages also say a telephone number found in a telephone book of Abu Zubaydah, a Saudi-born al Qaeda operative captured in Pakistan, was for a Colorado corporation that managed the affairs of the residence of Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the former Saudi ambassador to Washington. 
LAWSUITS AHEAD?
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said its agreement to the release is not an indication that the intelligence community agrees with the pages' accuracy or concurs with the information it contains.The office also on Friday released a declassified summary of an assessment of whether Riyadh may have supported al Qaeda before and after the attacks, saying the Saudi government and many of its agencies had been infiltrated and exploited by individuals associated with or sympathetic to Osama bin Laden's militant network.Several members of Congress said they were pleased the pages had finally been released. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the intelligence panel, said he hoped the release would quiet rumors.
""The Intelligence Community and the 9/11 Commission, which followed the Joint Inquiry that produced these so-called 28 pages, investigated the questions they raised and was never able to find sufficient evidence to support them,"" he said.Legislation that would allow families of Sept. 11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia, was passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate and is making its way through the House, despite President Barack Obama's veto threat.""While the pages do not reach a conclusion regarding Saudi involvement in the 9/11 attacks, they provide more than enough evidence to raise serious concerns,"" said Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. His state was home to many people killed when planes hit the World Trade Center in neighboring New York.Sept. 11 families made clear the pages' release would not stop their push for the legislation. ""Congress has to stand up for the interests of the thousands of innocent Americans who lost loved ones on 9/11,"" one group said in a statement.White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters before the pages were released that they would show no evidence of Saudi complicity.The Obama administration sent a declassified version of the 28 pages, with many lines and sentences blacked out to protect intelligence sources and methods, to Congress on Friday morning. The House intelligence panel released it a few hours later.

WASHINGTON Saudi Arabia welcomed on Friday the release of classified pages of the official report on the Sept. 11 attacks, and hoped their release would clear up suspicions about Riyadh's actions, intentions or long-term friendship with the United States.""Since 2002, the 9/11 Commission and several government agencies, including the CIA and the FBI, have investigated the contents of the '28 Pages' and have confirmed that neither the Saudi government, nor senior Saudi officials, nor any person acting on behalf of the Saudi government provided any support or encouragement for these attacks,"" Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States, Abdullah al-Saud, said in a statement.

By Ginger Gibson and Emily Stephenson
| CLEVELAND/WASHINGTON

CLEVELAND/WASHINGTON Donald Trump's choice of Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate has irked some Republican activists who see the Indiana governor's years of opposition to gay rights initiatives as a setback to efforts to broaden the party's appeal.The pick could bolster Trump's support among religious conservatives, but it also opens up a new line of attack for Democrats and liberals seeking to paint the New York businessman as a divisive candidate, putting at risk his efforts to woo moderate voters ahead of the Nov. 8 election against Democrat Hillary Clinton.[nL1N1A10HR]Rachel Hoff, the first openly gay member of the Republican Party's platform committee, has spent time in Cleveland ahead of next week's party convention trying repeatedly to get the party to change its official position on gay marriage and adoption by gay couples. She was dismayed by the choice of Pence.""After the Pence announcement, I think the question is - is Trump really moderate on gay rights issues? It seems more likely his rhetoric has been a smoke screen,"" Hoff said. ""There's no substance behind it. By picking Pence, Trump is signaling his administration may not be any friendlier to the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community.""Megan Robertson, a Republican strategist in Indiana who has pushed for the party to be more open to gay members, was similarly disappointed.""Picking Pence shows that he maybe doesn't care about that community as much as he tried to profess that he did,"" she said of Trump.Clinton's campaign seized on the announcement to attack Pence's record on gay rights issues, saying it ""embarrassed"" the people of Indiana. Clinton has previously called Trump the most divisive candidate ""in our lifetimes,"" referring to his calls to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country and to deport millions of undocumented immigrants.In 2015, Pence found himself at the center of a national uproar when he signed a bill that he said was meant to protect religious liberty, but which critics countered would allow business owners to deny services to gay people. 
After intense pressure from liberal groups and large corporations, he asked lawmakers to clarify that businesses could not deny services on the basis of sexual orientation, calling it a ""subject of great misunderstanding.""He has also fought against same-sex marriage and allowing gay people to serve openly in the military. A U.S. Supreme Court ruing last year legalized gay marriage nationwide and the Pentagon in 2011 ended the ban on openly gay and lesbian people serving in the military.In 2009, while a member of the U.S. Congress, Pence argued against expanding the definition of a hate crime to include sexual orientation, calling it an attempt to ""advance a radical social agenda."" The federal hate crimes law was expanded to make this inclusion.DIVIDED PARTY   

Gay supporters of Trump are hopeful Pence will have little influence on a potential Trump administration. Trump has declared himself the most gay-friendly candidate in the election. He expressed support for the gay community after a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando in June that killed 49 people, and broke from his party during an argument  about transgender bathroom usage, saying people could use the bathroom of their choosing at his office building Trump Tower in New York.That has cheered moderate Republicans who have been seeking to appeal to younger, more liberal voters.""Donald Trump is the nominee of the party and Donald Trump is going to set policy,"" said Chris Barron, who has launched LGBTrump, a group seeking to encourage gays to vote for Trump.
Pence, 57, comes from a different wing of the divided Republican Party than Trump, one that is dominated by evangelicals in southern and midwestern states. Conservatives were elated with his selection.""It's the best conservatives could possibly want,"" said Brent Bozell, a conservative leader. The pro-gay rights group Log Cabin Republicans said it would seek to pressure the Republican Party at the Cleveland national convention to adopt a more gay-friendly policy platform, including by running a full-page ad in a local paper.The party's platform committee met early in the week to draft official policy positions on myriad issues. The document, which carries little significance beyond the symbolic, calls for a constitutional amendment to reverse the Supreme Court's decision legalizing gay marriage and included a veiled acceptance of gay conversion therapy, a practice that has widely been criticized as harmful to children.Despite the disappointment that gay rights activists are feeling, Log Cabin Republican president Gregory Angelo said he thinks voters are going to look at Trump's past statement on gay rights and not where Pence stands. Trump has spent little time talking about social issues and has instead focused on immigration and economic issues. ""Donald Trump rose to stardom as our presumptive nominee because he showcased an opposition to illegal immigration and unfair trade deals. That's what's resonating with the Republican electorate this year,"" he said.

By Philip Blenkinsop
| BRUSSELS

BRUSSELS EU and U.S. negotiators said on Friday that they still needed to overcome large differences for a transatlantic free trade deal to be sealed this year, and factor in the impending exit from the European Union of Britain, one of the United States' biggest export markets.The two sides are trying to agree on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which supporters say could boost each economy by some $100 billion at a time when growth in China and emerging markets is slowing.Chief EU negotiator Ignacio Garcia Bercero and U.S. counterpart Dan Mullaney told a news conference after a 14th round of talks that both sides were committed to sealing a deal before U.S. President Barack Obama leaves office at the turn of the year.The partners have made progress on tariff elimination and on regulatory cooperation.However, they are stuck over EU demands including greater access to public sector tenders; Garcia Bercero described the U.S. offer as a serious cause of concern.Likewise, Washington is unhappy with the EU offer on services. 
""Given the importance of this sector to both of our economies ... progress here has been noticeably and painfully slow,"" said Mullaney.He also said that, while the economic rationale for TTIP remained strong, Britain's exit from the European Union would force a rethink as it was the largest market anywhere for U.S. services, and took 25 percent of U.S. exports to the EU.""Imagine if the United States said, for instance, 'Well, maybe TTIP will not apply to California'. There is a certain reflection that the parties need to have on those kind of developments.""
The two sides had previously planned to produce a single consolidated TTIP text by the end of July. Garcia Bercero said that was now more likely to come by the end of September after further meetings between U.S. trade chief Michael Froman and EU commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom.Garcia Bercero acknowledged that the political environment was becoming more challenging. The environmental group Greenpeace echoed the view of many anti-TTIP campaigners on Friday by saying that it was time to hit the 'Stop' button.But the EU negotiator said TTIP was instead a positive response to concerns about globalization.
""If we want to have a shot at shaping globalization, we need a like-minded partner that shares largely our views,"" he said.Mullaney talked of a ""unique window of opportunity"" to complete TTIP this year that should not be allowed to slip away.""After this year, with one political transition after another over the next few years, it could be quite a while before we pick up negotiations again.""

By Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican Donald Trump neared the end of his vice presidential search on Thursday and appeared to be leaning toward Indiana Governor Mike Pence, a conservative with the potential to unify divided Republicans.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee tweeted on Wednesday night that he would announce his choice on Friday at 11 a.m. (1500 GMT) in Manhattan.The New York businessman is to be formally nominated as the party's candidate for the Nov. 8 election at the Republican National Convention next week in Cleveland. Traditionally, the vice presidential choice is used to build enthusiasm among party loyalists.Trump's choice of running mate is seen as critical because his defeat of 16 rivals in the Republican primary race left the party divided and some party leaders are still uneasy about some of his campaign positions, and his style.Sources familiar with campaign operations cautioned that while Pence and former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich were finalists, Trump could always have a last-minute change of heart and choose someone else from his short list.
A source close to the campaign said Trump appeared to be  leaning toward Pence but could easily change his mind.Gingrich told an ABC News correspondent he expected to hear Trump's decision after 1 p.m. EDT and would not be surprised if Trump chooses Pence. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, 53, a former rival to Trump in the presidential race, is also high on the list of potential running mates and provides the kind of counterpunch to Democratic rival Hillary Clinton that Republicans like.
Pence, 57, a former congressman, is seen as a safe choice, not too flashy but popular among conservatives, with Midwestern appeal and the ability to rally more party faithful behind Trump.Gingrich, 73, is a close adviser to Trump with a wealth of ideas and deep experience in the legislative process from his time as speaker of the House of Representatives in the 1990s.In what has been an unusually public process, Trump, 70, sat down with both Pence and Gingrich separately in Indianapolis on Wednesday.
He also met with a fourth potential No. 2, U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions, 69, of Alabama, who has been one of Trump's closest advisers.The New York businessman had dinner with Pence on Tuesday night after they appeared together at a rally. Trump, joined by daughter Ivanka and sons Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, had breakfast with Pence and his wife, Karen, on Wednesday at the governor's residence in Indianapolis.Trump adviser Ed Brookover told CNN that Trump ""first and foremost"" wants a running mate who he has good chemistry with and someone who can help him govern best.

By Emily Flitter and Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Many Americans view Islam unfavorably, and supporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump are more than twice as likely to view the religion negatively as those backing Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, according to a Reuters/Ipsos online poll of more than 7,000 Americans.It shows that 37 percent of American adults have a ""somewhat unfavorable"" or ""very unfavorable"" view of Islam. This includes 58 percent of Trump supporters and 24 percent of Clinton supporters, a contrast largely mirrored by the breakdown between Republicans and Democrats.By comparison, respondents overall had an equally unfavorable view of atheism at 38 percent, compared with 21 percent for Hinduism, 16 percent for Judaism and 8 percent for Christianity. Spokespeople for Trump and Clinton declined to comment.The poll took place before an attacker on Thursday drove his truck into a holiday crowd in Nice, France, killing more than 80 people in what President Francois Hollande called a terrorist act. Police sources said the driver, while linked to common crimes, was not on a watch list of intelligence services and no Islamist militant group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.The race for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election has put a spotlight on Americans' views of Muslims with Trump proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. He repeated the proposal after Omar Mateen, a New York-born Muslim armed with an assault rifle, killed 49 people in an attack on a Florida gay nightclub last month. The ideological divide between Trump and Clinton supporters is set against a backdrop of increasing violence and discrimination against Muslims in the United States.
The poll shows 78 percent of Trump supporters and 36 percent of Clinton supporters said that when compared to other religions, Islam was more likely to encourage acts of terrorism. Trump supporters were also about twice as likely as Clinton supporters to say that Islam was more encouraging of violence toward Americans, women and gay people. Polling on none of the other belief systems and their perceived connection to terrorism or violence came close to matching those numbers.Clinton has called for a more inclusive environment within American society and for a joint effort between the U.S. government and Muslim countries to battle the spread of Islamist militancy. She has criticized Trump's harsh statements about Muslims and Mexicans while Trump has bemoaned what he calls American society's devotion to political correctness.
Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/29IPJ6lTRUMP, REPUBLICANS ALIGNED
Party affiliation accounted for the deepest division among Americans where their views on Muslims were concerned. Respondents' status as rich or poor, young or old, or male or female did not offer as pronounced an overall view as did their identification as Democrats or Republicans. 
""If it was true that Trump did not represent Republicans broadly defined, you would think Republicans would look different; they don't,"" said Douglas McAdam, a sociology professor at Stanford University who studies American politics.""It goes against the claims of the (former presidential candidate) Mitt Romneys of the world, that Trump is not really a Republican, that he doesn't represent the Republican party. He seems to be resonating with Republicans generally.""According to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights group, attacks on American Muslims and on mosques in the United States rose in 2015 to their highest level ever recorded. The group said 31 incidents of damage or destruction of mosques were reported; there were 11 incidents in which a Muslim person was the target of a slur or another kind of harassment. The Reuters/Ipsos poll ran in all 50 states from June 14 to July 6. It included 7,473 American adults and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 1 percentage point.

By Valerie Volcovici and Grant Smith
| WASHINGTON/NEW YORK

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Republican Donald Trump's selection of Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate cheered the U.S. energy industry and dismayed green advocates, with both sides citing Pence's support for coal mining and defiance of President Barack Obama's climate-change agenda.Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has called climate change a hoax and promised to gut U.S. environmental regulations in order to help the ailing oil and coal sectors. A Trump-Pence ticket will quash any expectation that the New York businessman might soften that stance heading into the Nov. 8 election.""Governor Pence has been a vocal opponent of the administration's Clean Power Plan,"" said Laura Sheehan, spokeswoman for the Washington-based lobby group American Council on Clean Coal Electricity.  ""We would hope to see a continuation,"" she said.Trump announced Pence as his running mate in a Twitter post on Friday morning, ending days of speculation over the choice ahead of the party's national convention in Cleveland next week. [nL1N1A10HR]Pence, 57, is listed on Obama's ""call out the climate change deniers"" website for arguing that the science behind climate change has not yet been resolved.In June 2015, Pence wrote to Obama saying that Indiana, America's eighth largest coal-producing state, would not comply with the Clean Power Plan regulating power plant emissions, calling it ""ill-advised."" Indiana is one of more than 25 states that have challenged the centerpiece of the Democratic president's environmental agenda.
In 2014, Pence alarmed local environmental groups by overturning an energy efficiency program enacted by his Republican predecessor, Mitch Daniels, saying it was too expensive for the state's manufacturers. The Indiana Public Utility Commission had estimated the program would create more than 18,600 jobs.""The choice of Pence shows Trump has little interest in appealing to anyone outside of his extremist base and Big Polluters,"" said Clay Schroers, a director at the League of Conservation Voters environmental group.    
SUPPORT FOR TRADITIONAL ENERGY
Trump has long signaled his support of traditional energy production - part of his broader appeal to blue-collar American voters. He outlined plans in May to sweep away environmental regulations ushered in by Obama, scrap the Paris Climate Accord, and revive the Keystone XL pipeline proposal - moves that would reverse years of gains by the green movement.Trump's Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in contrast, has promised more stringent regulation of the energy sector, efforts to boost renewable fuels use, and a commitment to join other nations to combat global climate change.
Pence ran for governor in 2012 after serving in the U.S. Congress. His campaign for governor received more than $850,000 from the energy sector, about 3 percent of the total, according to campaign finance disclosures.More than $300,000 of that came from the billionaire Koch brothers, strong advocates of small government and fiscal conservatism who took a liking to Pence.Both David and Charles Koch have said they will not support the Trump ticket. Trump has alarmed many Republican establishment figures with his fiery rhetoric on immigration and trade. But a former high-ranking operative in the Koch political organization who is close to both brothers said Pence could help make the donor network more receptive to Trump's campaign.
