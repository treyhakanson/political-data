By Dustin Volz and Emily Stephenson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A committee that raises money for Democratic candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives confirmed on Friday it had been hacked in an intrusion possibly linked to Russian hackers, similar to an earlier breach targeting another Democratic Party group.In an incident that escalated concerns about the potential for Russian meddling in U.S. politics, Reuters first reported on Thursday that the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing the hack at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC.The intrusion took place from at least June 19 to June 27, though it may have been longer, according to analysis conducted by U.S. network security company FireEye. The committee said in a statement it has hired cyber security firm CrowdStrike to investigate. ""We have taken and are continuing to take steps to enhance the security of our network,"" the committee said. ""We are cooperating with federal law enforcement with respect to their ongoing investigation.""The DCCC hack may be related to an earlier hack against the Democratic National Committee, which raises money and sets strategy for Democratic candidates nationwide. The DNC and DCCC occupy the same office building in Washington.Potential links to Russian hackers in both incidents were likely to heighten accusations, so far unproven, that Moscow is trying to meddle in the U.S. presidential election campaign to help Republican nominee Donald Trump.The Kremlin denied involvement in the DNC cyber attack.In June, a bogus website was registered with a name resembling a DCCC donation site. For some time, donation-related internet traffic that was supposed to go to a donation-processing firm instead went to the fake site.The DCCC intrusion may have been used to compromise the computer systems of donors who visited the spoof site, rather than to collect their personal information, said John Hultquist, manager of cyber espionage analysis at FireEye.
Several major Democratic donors contacted by Reuters on Friday said they had not been notified of the hack and were not concerned about their information being accessed. ""I'm less concerned about that than I am about my Amex being hacked,"" said John Morgan, 60, a Florida attorney.Cindy Miscikowski, 68, a California donor, said she would be upset if hackers got her bank information, but otherwise she was not worried because donations are disclosed publicly.   
RUSSIAN TIES
The timeframe of the DCCC hack would place it days after the DNC went public with its breach and said the hackers had been kicked out of its systems. Sources said the numerical Internet address of the spurious DCCC site resembled one used by a Russian government-linked hacking group, one of two suspected in the DNC breach.Rich Barger, co-founder of security intelligence firm ThreatConnect Inc, said his analysis of the fake donation site tied it to the group linked to Russian military intelligence. He said the web domain name was set up through a service that accepts bitcoin, with a contact email address that had been used to set up websites involved in a major German hack, which also was attributed to the Russian group.
Cyber experts and U.S. officials said this week there was evidence that Russia engineered the DNC hack to release sensitive party emails and influence U.S. politics.The DNC hack raised concerns among Democrats at the party's convention in Philadelphia, where Hillary Clinton was nominated as the party's candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election.The new hack at the DCCC could add pressure on the Obama administration to make a public accusation or retaliate. The Justice Department and other agencies have said it is important for deterrence to ""name and shame"" cyber adversaries.""Any efforts on a nation state's part to interfere with U.S. politics through cyber attacks would appear to cross a line that would demand a response from the U.S. government,"" said D.J. Rosenthal, a former Justice Department and National Security Council official.A former White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said any formal accusation would require overwhelmingly certain evidence.Staffers for the Republican National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said separately that those campaign organizing groups had not been hacked.

By Roberta Rampton
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON During a visit from Singapore's prime minister on Tuesday, President Barack Obama will extol the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal and commit to getting the deal done, a top White House official said on Friday, even though Obama's fellow Democrats panned it at their convention this week. Obama wants the U.S. Congress to approve the 12-nation trade deal, which he sees as a central part of his economic and foreign policy legacy, before he leaves the White House on Jan. 20.Free trade deals have been blamed for U.S. manufacturing plant closures, job losses and stagnant wages. Obama has cast the TPP as righting the wrongs of past trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. Both countries also are part of the TPP.Both Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump oppose the TPP, and it has become a hot-button issue in the campaign to replace Obama.Congressional leaders have been pessimistic about the odds of ratifying the deal either during the short session in September, or during the brief ""lame duck"" session after the Nov. 8 election.When Obama rolls out the red carpet for Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Tuesday, one of the main goals will be ""lifting up the benefits"" of the TPP, said Daniel Kritenbrink, top Asia policy adviser at the White House National Security Council.
""I predict he will also once again say to the prime minister that he's committed to getting TPP done and doing so before the end of his term,"" Kritenbrink told reporters on Friday.""TPP is going to be great for the American economy, for American workers and American companies,"" Kritenbrink said, noting Singapore, a signatory to the deal, strongly supports it.Trump has argued vociferously against multinational trade deals like TPP, saying he would prefer instead to have deals with specific countries one on one. On Thursday night at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Trump said TPP should be rejected.
""I like trade where the United States makes a lot of money,"" he said.Trump has been critical of Clinton, Obama's former secretary of state, and her vice presidential running mate Tim Kaine, for shifting their positions to oppose the trade deal.Signs protesting the deal were prominent during the Democratic convention, which wrapped up on Thursday.
Kaine, a Democratic senator who had praised the TPP deal until he joined Clinton's ticket, told CNN on Friday that he was concerned the deal gives corporations the power to challenge trade practices, but not unions or environmental groups.""The deal is going to come up for a vote and I can't vote for it with these secret courts that are open to the companies only,"" Kaine said in the interview.Obama is ""acutely aware"" of the difficult election year politics for the TPP but that will not stop him from forging ahead, White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters on Friday.""The president absolutely believes this deal should pass this year,"" Schultz said.

They can either cede that ground to China - the president believes that is the wrong approach, that we have the opportunity, we're in the catbird seat to write the rules of the road for trade right now and we should absolutely do that,"" White House spokesman Eric Schultz said.

WASHINGTON/HAVANA The United States and Cuba have concluded a ""substantive"" second round of talks on multibillion-dollar claims against one another in Washington and agreed to hold more regular meetings on the matter, a State Department Official said on Friday.The former Cold War foes had a first meeting outlining their respective claims in December in Havana as part of a deepening detente.The issue is one of the key and complex obstacles to normalization of relations between the two countries.""The second meeting was more substantive both in exploring more details about claims that need to be resolved but also in reviewing the practices of both countries in solving claims,"" the State Department official told reporters on condition of anonymity.""Both sides agreed they would have more regular meetings.""There is no set date yet for the next meeting, which will place in Havana, in accordance with bilateral protocol, the official said.
Cuba wants at least $121 billion in reparations for economic damages caused by the U.S. trade embargo and at least $181 billion for ""human damages.""The United States has awarded its firms and individuals $1.9 billion worth of claims against Cuba for factories, farms, homes and other assets that were nationalized on the island after Fidel Castro's rebels came to power in 1959.
Those claims are now roughly worth $8 billion when including 6 percent annual interest. The Cuban government has reached settlements with other countries for expropriated assets but it cut off negotiations with the United States when bilateral relations soured in the 1960s.Many of the nationalized companies no longer exist and individual claims have been passed to heirs.
The State Department official said the United States also is claiming $2.2 billion for court judgments outstanding against Cuba and hundreds of millions for former government mining interests on the island.Cuba's Foreign Ministry said in a statement the two countries had continued sharing information on their respective claims ""with the aim of preparing the process of negotiation.""

4	4	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll-reutersipsos-idUSKCN10910T	The year of 'Neither': Why Reuters/Ipsos is tweaking its U.S. presidential poll	"


By Maurice Tamman
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK In a presidential campaign notable for its negativity, the option of ""Neither"" candidate appears to be an appealing alternative, at least to participants in the Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll.Many voters on both sides have been ambivalent in their support for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump, complicating the task of the pollsters trying to track the race.That sentiment may help explain an apparent skew that recently emerged in the Reuters/Ipsos poll results. Given the choice, a relatively large group of voters opted for ""Neither/Other"" candidate compared with other major polls, leading to an underreporting of several percentage points for one or other of the two major contenders at times in the race.As a result, Reuters/Ipsos is amending the wording of the choice and eliminating the word ""Neither,"" bringing the option in line with other polls.The amended Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll will be published later Friday, available at polling.reuters.com.MORE FROM REUTERS
Another Democratic group hackedSan Diego police say officer fatally shot, another woundedBreakingviews: Oracle-NetSuite deal may be sweetest for EllisonWhy Russian pump prices rise as oil prices fallGAPS FOR TRUMP, CLINTON
From the beginning of June until the middle of July, the Reuters/Ipsos survey showed consistently lower support for Trump than other polls were capturing. At times, the Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Clinton with a lead over Trump as wide as about 12 percentage points among registered voters - five percentage points higher than Clinton's lead in some other comparable polls.To determine the cause, the pollsters examined what made the Reuters/Ipsos poll different. Their conclusion: By giving respondents the option of ""Neither/Other,"" the survey appears to have captured greater numbers of ambivalent voters unwilling to commit to either candidate than other major polls, which only offer the choice of ""Other.""
During the period analyzed, the historically high antipathy for both major candidates, paired with the option of selecting ""Neither/Other,"" meant the Reuters/Ipsos poll probably underreported Trump's support before the Republican convention, perhaps by 3 to 5 percentage points.More recently, the ""Neither/Other"" option appeared to lead to an underreporting of Clinton's support in the run-up to the Democratic convention, said Cliff Young, pollster and president of Ipsos Public Affairs, which partners with Reuters on the poll. The pollsters estimated the Clinton shortfall at 2 to 4 percentage points.Tom W. Smith, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Society at the University of Chicago, said the earlier Trump numbers in the Reuters/Ipsos poll could have indicated a softness of support for Trump among a relatively small group of conservative voters who had yet to come to terms with his candidacy. It is plausible that a similar effect among Democratic voters may be hitting Clinton now when presented with the option of ""Neither,"" he said.And the skews displayed by the ""Neither"" phenomenon may indicate there is a chance for some gains among alternative party candidates, Smith said.Tim Mclheny, a 47-year-old civil servant from Vermont who describes himself as a moderate Republican, is a case in point. When asked in the Reuters/Ipsos poll who he will vote for in November, he skipped both Trump and Clinton and opted for ""Neither/Other.""
""It is the lesser of two evils,"" Mclheny said. He said he will cast his ballot for the candidate he believes will do the best for civil servants. Ultimately, however, he said he may well grudgingly opt for Trump come November. THE 'NEITHER' SKEWHere's how the pollsters reviewed their methodology and decided to drop ""Neither.""Ipsos tested three alternate versions of the presidential preference questions on different groups in a survey and compared those results to the outcome of the established version of the tracking poll. That test found eliminating the word ""Neither"" from the ""Neither/Other"" response increased Trump support by between 3 to 5 percentage points on any given day leading up to the Republican convention. It also increased Clinton's support, but by a smaller margin. hereSince the convention, however, Trump's support seems to have solidified among wary supporters. Now, the ""Neither"" issue appears to be affecting Clinton in the survey.
On Tuesday, for example, the established tracking poll had the candidates tied at 38 percent each. A 13-point lead for Clinton on July 14 had vanished in two weeks. (polling.reuters.com/#poll/TM651Y15_13/filters/PD1:1/dates/20160701-20160726/type/smallest)But eliminating ""Neither"" from the ""Neither/Other"" answer produced a different result. In that case, Clinton was ahead, 40 percent to 36 percent, on Tuesday.When asked the question in the new way, 11 percent of voters opted for ""Other."" By comparison, 14 percent opted for ""Neither/Other"" in the version of the survey that showed the race tied. The three-point gap suggests the ""Neither"" phenomenon was now working against Clinton.In the nearly five years Reuters/Ipsos has been offering the ""Neither/Other"" option to respondents in presidential polling, it has never yielded such a skew.The results highlight how poll designs and methodologies can yield significantly differing results, and how important differences can emerge from the way a question is framed.The Economist/YouGov poll, like the Reuters/Ipsos survey, is conducted online. It uses a similar battery of questions, but does not offer the ""Neither/Other"" option, just ""Other."" In Economist/YouGov's July 17 poll, Clinton was ahead by 4 percentage points among registered voters, with Trump at 41 percent.The NBC News/SurveyMonkey online poll gives three options: Clinton, Trump, or ""No Answer,"" which more firmly prods respondents to make a choice. In their July 17 poll, Clinton led Trump by one point, 46 to 45, among registered voters.Telephone polls tend to ask voter preference as an open-ended question, or just offer respondents the choice of the Democratic and Republican candidates.Among phone polls, such as the ABC News/Washington Post and NBC/Wall Street Journal surveys, Clinton recently led by four to five points. The CBS/New York Times telephone poll of registered voters had the race tied at 40 percent each.The Reuters/Ipsos presidential-preference poll result and other results in the survey are updated twice a week.

By Joseph Menn, Dustin Volz and Mark Hosenball
| SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON

SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON The FBI is investigating a cyber attack against another U.S. Democratic Party group, which may be related to an earlier hack against the Democratic National Committee, four people familiar with the matter told Reuters.The previously unreported incident at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC, and its potential ties to Russian hackers are likely to heighten accusations, so far unproven, that Moscow is trying to meddle in the U.S. presidential election campaign to help Republican nominee Donald Trump.DON'T MISS: Alphabet and Amazon wind up 'smokin'' quarter for big techWhy Russian pump prices rise as oil prices fallDemocratic campaign group for Congress confirms computer hackThe Kremlin denied involvement in the DCCC cyber-attack. Hacking of the party's emails caused discord among Democrats at the party's convention in Philadelphia to nominate Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate.The newly disclosed breach at the DCCC may have been intended to gather information about donors, rather than to steal money, the sources said on Thursday.It was not clear what data was exposed, although donors typically submit a variety of personal information including names, email addresses and credit card details when making a contribution. It was also unclear if stolen information was used to hack into other systems.The DCCC raises money for Democrats running for seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. The intrusion at the group could have begun as recently as June, two of the sources told Reuters.That was when a bogus website was registered with a name closely resembling that of a main donation site connected to the DCCC. For some time, internet traffic associated with donations that was supposed to go to a company that processes campaign donations instead went to the bogus site, two sources said.The sources said the Internet Protocol address of the spurious site resembled one used by Russian government-linked hackers suspected in the breach of the DNC, the body that sets strategy and raises money for the Democratic Party nationwide.
Cyber security experts and U.S. officials have said there was evidence that Russia engineered the DNC hack to release sensitive party emails in order to influence the U.S. presidential election.""I have concerns that an agency of foreign intelligence is hacking and interfering with a U.S. election,"" said Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, who added he had not seen news of the DCCC attack.Asked by Reuters to comment on whether Russia played a role in a cyber-attack on the DCCC, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""We don't see the point any more in repeating yet again that this is silliness.""The release of the DNC emails by activist group WikiLeaks caused uproar in the party because they appeared to show favoritism within the DNC for Clinton over U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who ran a close race for the nomination for the Nov. 8 election. The committee is supposed to be neutral.The DNC and the DCCC share the same office space on South Capitol Street in Washington.The DCCC and donation processing company ActBlue had no comment on Thursday. CrowdStrike, the California-based cyber security firm that investigated the DNC breach, declined to comment.
Justin Harvey, chief security officer at Fidelis Cybersecurity company, said the suspect website in the hack was affiliated with others that host sophisticated malware undetected by the vast majority of antivirus providers.""It's really rare malware,"" which would be more likely to be wielded by government hackers than ordinary criminals, he said. GREAT CONCERN
Russian officials have dismissed allegations of Moscow's involvement in hacks of U.S. political groups. ""It is so absurd it borders on total stupidity,"" Kremlin spokesman Peskov said on Thursday.Some Democratic officials have accused Russia of hacking the DNC emails in order to help Trump win the race for the White House.
""It's no coincidence someone is hacking into Democratic Party computers. It's almost sounding like a repeat of Watergate,"" Gilberto Hinojosa, the chairman of the Texas Democrats said, after Reuters reported the DCCC hacking.""This is just the kind of dirty politics we expect from Donald Trump. I have no doubt Donald Trump is behind it,"" he said, citing the businessman's praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin and recent remarks about Russia and Clinton's deleted emails.Trump angered Democrats this week by inviting Russia to unearth tens of thousands of emails from rival Clinton's tenure as U.S. secretary of state. Trump said on Thursday his comment was meant to be sarcastic.Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist who once worked for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, said the possibility of the DCCC being hacked was cause for great concern.""Until proven otherwise, I would suggest that everyone involved with the campaign committee operate under the assumption Russians have access to everything in their computer systems,"" Manley said.The Federal Bureau of Investigation referred questions about the DCCC attack to a statement it made on Monday about the DNC hack:""The FBI is investigating a cyber intrusion involving the DNC and are working to determine the nature and scope of the matter. A compromise of this nature is something we take very seriously, and the FBI will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace.""Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said on Thursday the U.S. intelligence community was not ready to ""make the call on attribution"" as to who was responsible for the DNC hack.Clapper, speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, acknowledged: ""There's just a few usual suspects out there"" who might be responsible for the cyber intrusion, suggesting it was the work of a state actor rather than an independent hacking group.Clapper said in May he was aware of attempted hacks on campaigns and related groups and he expected to see more as the November election neared. The last two U.S. presidential cycles in 2008 and 2012 witnessed a barrage of cyber attacks from a range of adversaries targeting President Barack Obama's campaign and the campaigns of his Republican foes, officials have said.

By Mitra Taj
| LIMA

LIMA Failure to ratify the U.S.-led sweeping trade pact TPP would hand China ""the keys to the castle"" on globalization and do nothing to solve the real problems underlying American anxiety over jobs, the top U.S. trade official said Thursday.The tariff-slashing Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) has turned into a hot-button topic in the run-up to the Nov. 8 U.S. election, threatening to dampen support from lawmakers needed to pass a deal critics condemn as a job-killer.U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said he was still optimistic Congress would pass the 12-member TPP, in part because China has been moving ahead with a trade deal of its own, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), that would boost its exports and let it set labor and environmental standards in the fast-growing Asia Pacific region.""We're one vote away from either cementing our leadership in this region and in the global trading system or ceding it to China,"" Froman told reporters in Lima after attending the inauguration of Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. ""At the end of the day I don't think Congress wants to be responsible for handing the keys to the castle to China.""
Froman's defense of the TPP follows weeks of heated attacks on the deal as anti-TPP chants and signs have peppered the Republican and Democratic conventions.Republican nominee Donald Trump has called the TPP a ""death blow"" for manufacturing jobs and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has firmed up her opposition to it in recent days.
Froman declined to comment on the candidates but said the TPP had become a ""scapegoat"" for legitimate concerns over income inequality, stagnant wages and jobs lost to automation. ""You don't get to vote on the next generation of robots,"" he said, ""you get to vote on trade agreements"".But the debate over TPP has also helped broaden support for domestic policies, such as infrastructure development and educational programs, to help Americans adapt to rapid economic change, Froman said.U.S. President Barack Obama wants the TPP passed this year.
Froman ruled out renegotiating the ""carefully balanced"" text, but said issues were being solved by working on country implementation plans. He cited pork producers, dairy farmers and financial services as once-reluctant stakeholders that now back the TPP.""The last major issue outstanding has to do with biologics and intellectual property rights,"" Froman said. ""We're having good constructive conversations"" with members of Congress. (Reporting by Mitra Taj; Editing by Alison Williams)"	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

By Alana Wise
| PHILADELPHIA

PHILADELPHIA Chelsea Clinton took the stage of the Democratic National Convention on Thursday to portray her mother Hillary Clinton as a loving, smart and playful woman qualified to be elected president of the United States.  In a 12-minute introduction received warmly in a packed Philadelphia arena, Chelsea Clinton countered criticism that her mother is an untrustworthy politician who struggles to show compassion in front of American voters.""She's a woman driven by compassion, by faith, by a fierce sense of justice and a heart full of love,"" the only child of presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton and former U.S. President Bill Clinton told the crowd.Hillary Clinton took the stage minutes later to become the first woman to accept the presidential nomination of a major U.S. party. Chelsea Clinton, a 36-year-old mother of two, was the last in a series of speakers at the four-day gathering who sought to cast Hillary Clinton in a familial light ahead of the Nov. 8 election against Republican Donald Trump.
She called her mother a ""wonderful, thoughtful, hilarious"" person who made time during her childhood to attend dance and piano recitals, and to gaze at the sky with her to find ""shapes in the clouds"".""That feeling of being valued and loved, that's what my mom wants for every child. It is the calling of her life,"" Chelsea Clinton said.President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden had also given speeches supporting Clinton, casting her as qualified for the Oval Office because of her experience as a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady, but also because of her loyalty and passion.
Chelsea Clinton, who has been in the public eye since her childhood in the White House, took a low profile after her father left office in 2001. She married investment banker Marc Mezvinsky and served as vice chair of the Clinton Foundation charity.After her mother's presidential bid she re-entered public life to hit the campaign trail, endearing herself to supporters with stories of Clinton as a mother and grandmother to her children, Charlotte, aged 2 come September, and Aidan, born in June.
Trump has also relied on his children to soften his image.His eldest daughter Ivanka spoke at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland last week, depicting the New York businessman as ""color-blind and gender-neutral"" to counter critics who have called his comments about immigrants and women bigoted and callous.Both candidates' children say they are friends, a relationship they struck up before their parents launched campaigns for the White House.

By James Oliphant and Jonathan Allen
| PHILADELPHIA

PHILADELPHIA Twelve years ago, Barack Obama's electrifying speech at the Democratic National Convention brought tears to Andrew Gillum's eyes.Now mayor of Tallahassee, Florida, and viewed as a rising star in that state, Gillum did not hesitate when asked to name his political role model. ""Elizabeth Warren,"" he replied, referring to the firebrand U.S. senator from Massachusetts. That the 37-year-old African-American mayor of a Southern U.S. city identifies Warren as his political lodestar speaks volumes about the Democratic Party's progressive shift, even as Hillary Clinton officially became its presidential nominee after a quarter-century in the public eye.With the party in transition, Clinton's 1990s-era brand of Democratic centrism is slowly being eclipsed by a wave of progressivism personified by Warren and by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, a rival of Clinton's until he endorsed her this month.Although Sanders' insurgent presidential bid fell short, leaving his supporters bitterly disappointed, a new crop of Democratic candidates seems determined to carry on his work, with Warren, 67, as their putative leader. Like Obama in 2004, Gillum and many others at the Philadelphia convention sought to boost their profiles, raise cash and network with fellow Democrats, buoyed by the adoption of the most progressive platform in party history, with planks for debt-free college, expanded Social Security benefits and a tax on carbon emissions.Clinton, too, has moved to the left, embracing many of these causes, separating herself from a more moderate brand of Democratic politics personified by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who was pro-free trade, friendlier to Wall Street and emphasized budget discipline. She appealed to Sanders supporters during her speech accepting the party's presidential nomination on Thursday, pledging to work with him on progressive issues. ""Let's go out there and make it happen together,"" Clinton said. Sarah Lloyd, 44, a congressional candidate in Wisconsin who supported Sanders, said, ""There is an energy that's coming from the folks that were brought to the process by the Sanders campaign.... That can only be a positive thing for the party.""
TAKING THE LEAD
More than Sanders, Warren has taken the lead in shaping the Democrats' next generation. Formerly a professor of law, Warren conceived and set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau formed in 2011 under President Obama.She launched a political action committee to back Democratic candidates and inspired other advocacy groups, such as the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, to solicit donations to a bloc it terms the party's ""Warren wing.""A speaker at the convention, Florida's Gillum was frustrated by Sanders because he seemed disinterested in helping other Democratic candidates, in contrast with Warren. ""Senator Sanders was content to be a movement by himself,"" Gillum said. ""It's a revolution when you bring people along with you."" 
Warren's committee has donated to the campaigns of U.S. Senate hopefuls such as Kamala Harris, 51, of California, Jason Kander, 35, of Missouri, and Catherine Cortez Masto, 52, of Nevada. They and Wisconsin's Lloyd oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the global trade deal that has split the progressive and moderate elements of the party.The PCCC's slate of ""Warren wing"" candidates supports a $15-an-hour minimum wage, campaign-finance reform and tighter rules for Wall Street. One of those on the slate is Zephyr Teachout, a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in New York, who has campaigned in a T-shirt that reads, ""I'm from the Elizabeth Warren wing of the party"" and who has been endorsed by Sanders. ""There is a rising and very important populism, talking about money in politics, talking about trade, talking about economic issues,"" Teachout, 44, told Reuters. ""Within the party, and across the board, there has been a serious rethinking of trade, rethinking of big banks, rethinking of monopolies that have too much power.""Tulsi Gabbard, a U.S. representative from Hawaii, is often mentioned by Sanders supporters as one who could assume his mantle. A cable-news regular, Gabbard, 35, was one of a few Sanders supporters offered a convention speaking slot. Onstage she formally nominated Sanders for president, saying he had become a ""voice for millions, connecting seamlessly with laborers in the Rust Belt and environmentalists in the West.""Other rising Democratic progressives frequently cited by strategists include Julian Castro, 41, the U.S. housing secretary, and his twin brother, Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas, former Ohio state senator Nina Turner, 48, U.S. Senate candidate Pramila Jayapal, 50, of Washington, and former South Carolina lawmaker Bakari Sellers, 31.
BRIGHTER THAN THE REST?
Harris might be the one to shine the brightest. As California's attorney general, Harris has been mentioned as a potential U.S. presidential candidate or U.S. Supreme Court justice should she win her Senate race in November.She enjoys the support of Warren, Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and former New York City Mayor, Michael Bloomberg, a Republican-turned-independent, suggesting she can appeal to both the party's liberal and moderate flanks. She joined forces with Bloomberg in his crusade for tighter gun laws, bonded with Warren over helping homeowners struggling through the foreclosure crisis of the late 2000s and joined Obama's efforts to overhaul a criminal justice system that tends to treat black citizens more harshly than white ones.In one campaign ad, Warren is viewed saying, ""Kamala Harris was fearless.""Harris, in turn, has backed Clinton. In an interview, she rejected the idea that the party is leaving Clinton behind even as it nominates her for president. ""I strongly believe that these two generations have much more in common than what separates them in terms of fundamental values,"" Harris said.

PHILADELPHIA There is the Democratic convention unfolding onstage in Philadelphia this week, broadcast to millions on television. Then there is a second convention that exists largely hidden from public view in the smartphones of Bernie Sanders' delegates.Using various messaging apps and secret Facebook groups, many of the delegates pledged to the U.S. senator and runner-up in the party's presidential nomination contest have been coordinating among themselves in Philadelphia. This is where they debate how to show their opposition to Hillary Clinton, who will formally accept her nomination on Thursday as the Democratic Party's candidate for the Nov. 8 election but who is viewed by many left-leaning Sanders' supporters as too moderate.There are arguments, flashes of paranoia and conspiracy as well. The messages often fly around too quickly to track.""It makes your head explode, all these different apps,"" said Jessica Chambers, a Sanders delegate from Wyoming. She added one group using the Slack messaging app had more than 600 delegates. She poked at her iPhone, which had overheated and blacked out.The clearest sign of the networks' power came on Tuesday evening, when at least 100 Sanders delegates quietly walked out in protest at Clinton becoming the nominee, after word of the plan spread through smartphones about an hour in advance.At the time, Chambers was sitting near her Clinton-supporting friend Shelby Read, who said she is amused by the secrecy of the Sanders crew but supportive of their dissent. 
""I never know what they're doing,"" Read told her friend later. ""I thought people were going out to get food.""Many of the smartphone debates revolve around the question: What Would Bernie Do? But even when Sanders himself has weighed in, sending a mass text and email to his delegates on Monday evening urging against booing and back-turning, it is not always seen as an authoritative answer.    ""Ignore that message,"" one skeptical recipient wrote in a message. ""Bernie did not write it. Express yourselves freely."" 
The dissent in Philadelphia was fueled by leaked emails last week that showed the Democratic Party leadership tried to undermine Sanders during the primary campaign. In the streets of Philadelphia, thousands of angry left-wing protesters, including Sanders supporters, have marched, with some burning flags.As hails of boos grew from the convention floor on Monday evening, despite Sanders' call for decorum, one delegate sent a warning around: ""Stop booing and 'misrepresenting' Bernie and the campaign,"" it read.The replies bristled. ""We don't tell each other what to do,"" ran one.        Secrecy is encouraged among the members of the smartphone chat groups, and so delegates who showed messages to Reuters did so on condition of anonymity. They are wary of the party or security officials thwarting their plans.
The closest thing to a leadership structure is Coalition of 57, a small group of delegates that came together in the weeks before the convention. Members say they are in contact with officials in the Sanders campaign, but remain independent.Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, said he was not in contact with Coalition of 57, but otherwise declined to discuss the delegates' networks. Coalition of 57 delegates were among those who, with mixed results, sought to tamp down the boos this week, suggesting instead to withhold cheers and applause, or wordlessly hold up protest signs during certain speakers.""Let the silence be deafening,"" Dani Pellett, a coalition member for the Texas delegation, said.
