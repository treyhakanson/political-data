By Roberta Rampton
| SEATTLE

SEATTLE The financial and political fallout from Britain's vote to leave the European Union has added to a string of setbacks for President Barack Obama as he works to burnish his legacy before his presidency ends in January 2017.The Brexit decision came after a deadlock in the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday effectively ended Obama's push to overhaul immigration rules, and the week after the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history.For Obama, the reversals heighten pressure on him and fellow Democrats to work harder for the Nov. 8 elections - particularly for the party's presumptive presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, who represents his best shot at making sure more of his policies are not rolled back.Speaking at two fundraising events in Seattle on Friday night, at the end of an arduous day that saw global markets plunge after the Brexit vote, Obama acknowledged the shifting political winds four months from the vote.""If you didn't think the stakes were high before, you should think the stakes are pretty high right now,"" Obama said at an intimate fundraising dinner at the home of tech executive Steve Singh. Guests, arranged in two long tables, paid $10,000 to $66,800 per couple.Obama has argued technology and globalization can increase opportunities for all, but conceded that recent events show many people are frightened by global competition and feel left behind.Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and political novice, has tapped into those concerns about the economy, trade and immigration - fears that also figured into the UK campaign to leave the EU.
""Unfortunately, when people are anxious and scared, there are going to be politicians out there who try to prey on that frustration to get themselves headlines and to get themselves votes,"" Obama told about 3,000 people who paid $250 and up to attend a campaign-style event on Friday for Washington State's Democratic Governor Jay Inslee.Clinton regained a double-digit lead over Trump this week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday that showed 46.6 percent of likely American voters supported Clinton while 33.3 percent backed Trump.'THE NINTH INNING'

In April, Obama had taken the unusual step of traveling to London to help the ""Remain"" camp of the referendum for his friend and ally, Prime Minister David Cameron, who will now leave office before Obama does.The financial uncertainty from Brexit threatens to weigh on the strong U.S. economy and undo some of the recovery seen since Obama took office in early 2009 at the height of the financial crisis.Earlier this week, Obama's plan to remove the specter of deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants was quashed when the Supreme Court deadlocked over lifting a hold on the action.
And two weeks ago, the nation's worst mass shooting in modern history, at a gay nightclub in Orlando, raised questions about how Obama is dealing with home-grown extremism - and served as a reminder of his failure to convince the U.S. Congress to tighten gun laws.The setbacks show the limits of action that any president can take unilaterally, said Justin Vaughn, a political scientist at Boise State University.""I don't think Obama's legacy has taken a hit so much as it came back to earth,"" Vaughn said.Still, the impression that his administration is unable to control its own political destiny could weigh on how history views Obama's time at the White House, said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political scientist at University of Houston.    ""Presidents are often judged by what happens in the ninth inning, so President Obama's last few months in office are important to cementing and enhancing his legacy,"" Rottinghaus said.

| TURNBERRY, Scotland

TURNBERRY, Scotland U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump thrust himself into the heart of Britain's vote to leave the European Union on Friday, calling it a ""great"" development and drawing parallels to his own insurgent campaign.In Scotland to reopen a golf resort he owns, the wealthy New York businessman wasted no time interpreting the outcome of the ""Brexit"" vote as an example of a global uprising against the established order. It's an argument he said fit in with his own campaign to shake up Washington by renegotiating free trade deals and stopping illegal immigration.""People want to take their country back. They want to have independence in a sense. You see it with Europe, all over Europe,"" Trump, 70, the presumptive Republican nominee, told a news conference at the Trump Turnberry golf course. He said the economic shock from the vote would ebb over time and that more European countries might want to break with the 28-nation European Union. Americans, he said, would have a chance ""to re-declare their independence"" and ""reject today's rule by the global elite"" when they vote on Nov. 8.""So I think you're going to have this happen more and more. I really believe that, and I think that it's happening in the United States. It's happening by the fact that I've done so well in the polls,"" he said.Trump's rival, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, said in a statement: ""This time of uncertainty only underscores the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House to protect Americans' pocketbooks and livelihoods, to support our friends and allies, to stand up to our adversaries, and to defend our interests.  ""It also underscores the need for us to pull together to solve our challenges as a country, not tear each other down,"" said Clinton, 68, a former U.S. secretary of state, who had openly favored Britain's remaining in the EU.    More than half a million Britons signed a petition earlier this year to bar Trump from entering Britain, where he has business interests, in response to his call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.British lawmakers decided against a ban as a violation of free speech.
TRUMP ASSAILS OBAMA
Trump assailed as inappropriate Democratic President Barack Obama's open appeals to Britain not to split off. Shaking off a tradition of not commenting on U.S. politics from foreign soil, Trump said Obama had been embarrassed.""It's something he shouldn't have done. It's not his country. It's not his part of the world. He shouldn't have done it. And I actually think that his recommendation perhaps caused it to fail,"" Trump said.Democrats and Republicans both took stock of a decision that seemed to indicate Trump's campaign had tapped into a global wave that might be hard to contain.Joined by his sons Don Jr. and Eric and daughter Ivanka, who help manage his business affairs, Trump arrived in his signature helicopter near his clubhouse resort, a Scottish flag blowing in the wind.
The candidate praised his children's business acumen, his Scottish-born mother and the golf course itself, dismissing complaints from Republicans that he should have stuck to the campaign trail at home.As it happened, by turning up when he did, Trump drew global televised attention to his views on the Brexit vote within hours of Britons waking up to the surprising result.""I said this was going to happen and I think that it's a great thing,"" said Trump, who weeks ago said he would be inclined to leave the EU.Trump had exchanged insults with British Prime Minister David Cameron, who supported staying in the EU and said on Friday after the vote he would resign by October. Cameron had called Trump's anti-immigrant policy ideas divisive and wrong.""I think David Cameron is a good man. He was wrong on this.  He didn't get the mood of his country right. He was surprised,"" Trump said, predicting that Britain and the United States would remain ""great allies.""
'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN'
Wearing a white hat emblazoned with his ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan, Trump walked up to the news conference with bagpipers heralding his arrival.His visit to Turnberry, to be followed by a stop at his resort in Aberdeen on Saturday, coincided with a vote that exposed deep divisions in Britain and dealt the biggest blow to the European project of greater unity since World War Two.Some Scots who are Turnberry members and who sat in the front row at Trump's news conference muttered ""no"" whenever the subject of Scotland leaving the EU came up.Scotland voted by a margin of 62 percent to 38 percent to remain in the EU, a result sharply at odds with Britain as a whole, which voted 52 percent to 48 percent to leave.Trump, who has yet to hold public office and rates unfavorably with 70 percent of Americans in an opinion poll, defeated a crowded field of opponents for the Republican nomination while weathering one controversy after another. The latest was over the firing of his campaign manager this week, a month before the party convention.Trump invested $290 million in renovating the resort and golf course on Scotland's west coast, 85 km (53 miles) southwest of Glasgow.

By Kouichi Shirayanagi
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders said on Friday he would vote for Hillary Clinton to stop Republican Donald Trump from winning the White House, a lukewarm show of support that his campaign said was not a formal endorsement.Sanders' comments come after weeks of pressure from Democratic Party officials to throw his weight behind Clinton, the presumptive nominee. She locked up the required number of delegates this month with a string of wins in state-by-state primary contests.Clinton, the former U.S. secretary of state, senator, and first lady, needs Sanders' supporters to boost her chances against Trump in the Nov. 8 election. Only 40 percent of them say they would vote for her, with the rest undecided or divided between Trump, a third-party candidate and staying home, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. Asked if he would vote for Clinton in November, Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, told MSNBC television: ""Yes. The issue right here is I'm going to do everything I can to defeat Donald Trump. I think Trump in so many ways would be a disaster for this country if he were elected president.""""We do not need a president whose cornerstone of his campaign is bigotry, who is insulting Mexicans and Latinos and Muslims and women, who does not believe in the reality of climate change,"" he continued.
A spokeswoman for Sanders said his comments on MSNBC did not amount to an endorsement of Clinton, adding that ""Senator Sanders is also still an active candidate.""Trump has angered minority groups with his hard line on immigration, including calls to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country, deport millions of undocumented immigrants, and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border if he is elected. A spokeswoman for Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The wealthy New York businessman has rejected accusations his proposals are bigoted, and has said his policies would help minorities by bolstering the economy and creating jobs.
Trump has also called climate change a hoax by the Chinese to hurt business in the United States.      Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, managed to turn his long-shot run into a mass movement with proposals to combat wealth inequality, increase access to healthcare and education, and defend the environment.
His challenge to Clinton, one of the best-known figures in U.S. politics, lasted far longer than expected, running for four months and across 50 states and yielding record numbers of small donations to his campaign.Sanders has said he will continue to push for a liberal agenda heading into the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia from July 25-28, when Clinton's nomination is expected to become official. He has also made clear he does not want his presence to hurt the party's chances of holding onto the White House. Three-quarters of likely Democratic voters in the general election say Sanders should have a ""major role"" in shaping the party's positions, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted June 17-21. Nearly two-thirds also said that Sanders should endorse Clinton.  (Additional reporting by Chris Kahn in New York; Richard Valdmanis in Boston; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Jonathan Oatis)"

U.S. President Barack Obama said on Friday that he had spoken with British Prime Minister David Cameron about Britain's decision to leave the European Union and that he was confident the United Kingdom was committed to an orderly transition.""While the UK's relationship with the EU will change, one thing that will not change is special relationship that exists between our two nations,"" Obama said in a speech at a global entrepreneurs conference at Stanford University.

WASHINGTON Henry Paulson, a Republican who was U.S. Treasury secretary during the 2008 financial meltdown, on Friday called a Donald Trump presidency ""unthinkable"" and said he will vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton.Paulson joins a growing list of establishment Republicans who say they will not cast a ballot in the Nov. 8 election for Trump, the party's presumptive nominee and a political neophyte whose populist rhetoric runs counter to many long-held Republican principles.""When it comes to the presidency, I will not vote for Donald Trump,"" Paulson, who was chief executive of Goldman Sachs before becoming Treasury chief under Republican President George W. Bush, wrote in an opinion piece in the Washington Post.""I'll be voting for Hillary Clinton, with the hope that she can bring Americans together to do the things necessary to strengthen our economy, our environment and our place in the world,"" he said.Paulson accused Trump, who has touted his business acumen as a real estate developer during his campaign, of taking ""imprudent risk"" and then disavowing his debts when ventures fail.
He also took aim at Trump's opposition to trade agreements, which Paulson said have created U.S. jobs and fostered innovation and competitiveness.""Simply put, a Trump presidency is unthinkable,"" Paulson said.
The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Brent Scowcroft, a national security adviser to two Republican presidents, endorsed Clinton on Wednesday, and Richard Armitage, a deputy secretary of state under George W. Bush, said last week he would support her.
Paulson, who helped steer a $700 billion bailout of the financial system through Congress during the financial meltdown, said Trump is a ""phony"" who is unfit to be president.""I can't help but think what would have happened if a divisive character such as Trump were president during the 2008 financial crisis, at a time when leadership, compromise and careful analysis were critical,"" he said.

By Ayesha Rascoe
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday said the United States remains committed to bringing home Americans held captive overseas and helping their families, a year after the administration promised to overhaul its handling of hostage situations.""We will not stop until we can bring our fellow citizens back to their families,"" Obama said in a statement on the anniversary of the White House's policy review.Obama specifically named journalist Austin Tice who disappeared in Syria in 2012, Caitlan Coleman held in Afghanistan, and retired FBI agent Robert Levinson, who went missing in Iran more than nine years ago.Earlier this week, the families of four Americans killed by Islamic State urged Obama to do everything possible to bring home Tice, the only U.S. journalist known to be held in war-torn Syria.
The parents of the slain hostages criticized Obama for not personally naming Tice in his remarks at this year's White House Correspondents' Association Dinner when Obama said that he would ""fight for the release of American hostages held against their will."" They said Tice's return would be a test of the of the success of the administration's new policy.The White House undertook a six-month review of its hostage policies after complaints from families that their initiatives to free relatives captured abroad had been discouraged and sometimes blocked by government officials.
As part of the overhaul, Obama named James O'Brien special presidential envoy for hostage affairs at the State Department to help coordinate the efforts of law enforcement and diplomats.""But I know our work will not be done until our fellow Americans who are held against their will, and whose families mark their calendars by the days since they've held their loved ones, are reunited,"" Obama said.

By Terry Wade
| HOUSTON

HOUSTON With a number of U.S. states proceeding with investigations of Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) record on climate change, the attorney general of Massachusetts and investment funds of the Rockefeller family on Friday told a Congressional committee it lacked powers to oversee those probes.The pushback is the latest chapter in a high-stakes fight between the world's largest publicly traded oil company and a coalition of state attorneys general who have said they would go after Exxon to try and force action to tackle climate change.   The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology last week reiterated demands that state attorneys general hand over any records of consultations the prosecutors had with outside environmental groups before their probes were opened.Republicans on the committee have said about 20 state officials overreached when they jointly said in March they would participate in inquiries into whether Exxon executives misled the public by contradicting research from company scientists that spelled out the threats of climate change.
State officials have said the committee has no right to get involved.""The Committee lacks authority to interfere with an investigation by the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office into possible violations of Massachusetts law by ExxonMobil,"" said a letter to the committee from the office of Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey that was seen by Reuters.
In another letter to the House panel seen by Reuters, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Rockefeller Family Fund, two investment funds that have been critical of fossil fuels linked to climate change, said the committee's request ""imperiled the funds' First Amendment rights"" and said ""Congress's investigatory power is not unlimited.""Last week, Exxon asked a federal court to throw out a subpoena that would force it to hand over decades of documents on climate change to Healey's office.
Both sides in the standoff have sought to use the First Amendment of the Constitution, which guarantees freedom speech and freedom of assembly, among other protections, to press their cases. The House committee has complained the inquiries risk stifling free speech and scientific inquiry, and that state officials were coordinating with special interest groups.Exxon, which declined to comment on Friday, has repeatedly said that it has acknowledged the reality of climate change for years and communicated this to investors."

By Ayesha Rascoe
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama on Friday designated the site of a watershed event in the history of U.S. gay rights, the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, as a national monument, the first to honor the contributions of gay Americans.The Stonewall Inn gay bar in Manhattan's Greenwich Village was the scene of a police raid that triggered riots and ignited a long struggle to bring lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people into the American mainstream and guarantee their rights.""Welcome to the family,"" the National Park Service said in a  tweet welcoming its 412th site.LGBT rights advocacy groups hailed the national recognition, saying it will help highlight the gay communities' continued struggles, especially in the aftermath of the June 12 mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Florida that killed 49 people.""This new national monument will be a source of inspiration to a new generation of Americans across the country standing up for equality and uniting to show the world that love conquers hate,"" Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said.The move was the latest of several steps Obama has take on  gay rights during his presidency. 
In 2010, he signed a law repealing a policy that had banned gays from serving openly in the U.S. military. In 2012, he became the first president to support gay marriage, a stance he has admitted took time to evolve. His administration also supported the legal challenge that led to the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage nationwide.""There is important distance yet to travel, but through political engagement and litigation, as well as individual acts of courage and acceptance, this movement has made tremendous progress toward securing equal rights and equal dignity,"" Obama said in a proclamation officially designating the historic site.The events of late June and early July 1969 in New York helped start the modern American gay rights movement.
A week of violent clashes on Christopher Street between patrons of the Stonewall Inn and police, who had periodically raided the bar, arresting gays under morals laws of the era, became known as the Stonewall riots.The crackdown was also tied up in a dispute between the Mafia, which owned the bar, and corrupt police officers seeking payoffs for protection. But it unleashed a year of protests, culminating with the first gay pride parade in 1970.This year's weekend LGBT pride festivities started in New York on Friday with a street fair and were to culminate with Sunday's parade through Lower Manhattan. Events were scheduled across the country in San Francisco, Minneapolis, Oklahoma City and elsewhere.
Obama's designation protects about 7.7 acres (3.1 hectares) of land, including the Stonewall Inn and nearby Christopher Park. U.S. lawmakers representing New York, in a statement, called the site ""a beacon for liberation.""It drew renewed attention in the wake of this month's massacre in Orlando at another gay venue, a nightclub called Pulse. Mourners in New York flocked to the inn and created a makeshift memorial after the shooting, the worst such attack in modern U.S. history. In honor of the new monument, the White House will release a video that will be played on billboards in New York's Times Square on Saturday. U.S. officials will also hold a designation ceremony at Stonewall on Monday. (Reporting by Ayesha Rascoe and Susan Heavey; Editing by Will Dunham and Dan Grebler)"

By John Whitesides and Luciana Lopez
| WASHINGTON/NEW YORK

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Britain's stunning vote to leave the European Union, buoyed by a frenzy of nationalism and populist anger, was a crushing rejection of the political elite. Republican Donald Trump hopes it is also a preview of November's U.S. presidential election.The referendum result reverberated immediately in a U.S. presidential campaign dominated by Trump's rapid rise to capture the nomination, fueled by a similar brew of anti-establishment and anti-globalization sentiment.The vote in Britain reinforced the notion that the insurgent campaign launched by the wealthy real estate developer had tapped into a global political movement that might be hard to stop.""This is a protest vote against globalization and there is one presidential candidate who won the nomination who has put globalization in his crosshairs - and that's Donald Trump,"" Republican strategist John Feehery said.Trump, who has spent much of his campaign warning of the dangers posed by immigrants who illegally enter from Mexico and proposing a temporary ban on U.S. entry for Muslims, has matched the global mood with his rhetoric.""There are swaths of the population around the world who are struggling economically in the current economy, and groping for targets of blame,"" said Katherine Cramer, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.""Trump and the Brexit vote offer up tangible targets, and it is not surprising that people grab onto them. The vote yesterday is a reminder that Trump could very well win the presidential election,"" she said.A Brexit supporter, Trump was happy to note the parallels to his own campaign when he reopened his golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, on Friday. Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton bemoaned the result.
The referendum, which most British opinion polls had predicted was headed to defeat, was a wake-up call for Democrats who have been heartened by Clinton's lead over Trump in opinion polls of late.""I woke up this morning a little dismayed,"" said Democratic strategist Dane Strother. ""The question is whether Trump is similarly underperforming in the polls here. If that under-polled anger was present in Britain, as a Democrat you have to hope it isn't mirrored here.""Global stock markets wobbled immediately after the vote, which experts warned could trigger a global recession and weaken the U.S. economy.CAUTIONARY TALE

British Prime Minister David Cameron, who said after the vote he could step down by October, presents a cautionary lesson for Clinton as she prepares to face Trump. British voters ignored repeated warnings from Cameron about the dire consequences of a departure from the European Union.Clinton can take advantage of the unsettled global mood without indulging in predictions of doom or the over-the-top rhetoric that sometimes has set back Trump, Republican strategist Rich Galen said.""She can reflect some of the same sentiment that Trump and the Brexit forces tapped into but use it to her advantage,"" Galen said. ""She is not going to, and doesn't want to, out-Trump Trump, but the idea is to say, 'I understand these concerns.'""Clinton adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters after the vote that she has ""a real confidence that Americans are generous, tolerant, big-hearted people"" who believe that the country is stronger together.
""They're going to watch what impact (the Brexit vote) ends up having on the U.K. and on the British economy and come November, they are going to make their own decision about the kind of leadership that they're looking for,"" he said.Differences between the electorates in the United Kingdom and the United States are one reason the Brexit sentiment may not translate fully into success for Trump. About 30 million votes were cast in the last British general election in 2015, with about 10 percent of those cast by minority voters. Polling in the UK ahead of the Brexit vote suggested broad support for staying in the EU among those voters.By contrast, according to the Pew Research Center, nonwhite voters constituted 26 percent of all voters in the 2012 U.S. general election -- and by a huge margin they backed Democratic President Barack Obama. Pew projects that by November, nearly one in three voters will be a minority, and opinion polls show Trump struggling with those blocs.Just being more mature, experienced and sympathetic than Trump may not be enough for Clinton.""The argument is you need a responsible grownup, but a large part of the world doesn't want a responsible grownup,"" said Tom Rath, a New Hampshire-based Republican strategist. ""I don't think it's enough to say I know all the stuff he doesn't or he's rash, because right now people aren't filtering that through.""

By David Lawder
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Britain's looming exit from the European Union is another huge setback for negotiations on a massive U.S.-EU free trade deal that were already stalled by deeply entrenched differences and growing anti-trade sentiment on both sides of the Atlantic. The historic divorce launched by Thursday's vote will almost certainly further delay substantial progress in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) talks as the remaining 27 EU states sort out their own new relationship with Britain, trade experts said on Friday. With French and German officials increasingly voicing skepticism about TTIP's chances for success, the United Kingdom's departure from the deal could sink hopes of a deal before President Barack Obama leaves office in January.""This is yet another reason why TTIP will likely be postponed,"" said Heather Conley, European program director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington.""But to be honest, TTIP isn't going anywhere, I believe, before 2018 at the earliest,"" she said.U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said in a statement on Friday that he was evaluating the UK decision's impact on TTIP, but would continue to engage with both European and UK counterparts.    ""The importance of trade and investment is indisputable in our relationships with both the European Union and the United Kingdom,"" Froman said. ""The economic and strategic rationale for T-TIP remains strong.""
TTIP negotiators are still expected to meet in Brussels in mid-July as scheduled, but those talks were aimed at focusing on less controversial issues while leaving the thorniest disagreements for U.S. and EU political leaders to resolve. And it is unclear when Britain will launch formal separation proceedings, which will take at least two years.But analysts said both sides have been reluctant to put their best offers on the table with a new U.S. president due to take office in January and French and German leadership elections nearing in 2017.The Brexit also will preoccupy EU officials in coming months as they launch their own negotiations with London over the future terms of UK-EU trade, and sort out their post-Brexit priorities, said Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy, a Brussels-based think tank.    Britain's departure could leave U.S. negotiators facing a European side that is more dug-in on some issues, said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank in Washington.
""As the UK is part of the coalition of liberal trading economies in the EU, the U.S. is losing one of the more like-minded countries from the group in Brussels sitting on the other side of the negotiating table,"" said Bown, a former World Bank economist.However, Lee-Makiyama, who also sees little chance of a deal before 2018, said Britain's departure could eliminate one source of disagreement because the UK has insisted on a financial services chapter in the trade deal.""The only real proponent of banking regulation in TTIP is the UK. Germany and France are probably willing to let it go,"" he said. ""It still leaves about 20 outstanding issues at nearly the same level of difficulty.""
The TTIP negotiations, which started three years ago, have unable to settle major differences over agriculture, where the EU side has shown little willingness to alter food safety rules that prohibit American beef raised with hormones or genetically modified foods, or open its closely guarded geographical food naming rules, such as for Asiago and feta cheeses.European negotiators have complained that the United States has offered too little to open up its vast federal, state and local government procurement markets to European vendors with ""Buy American"" preferences in place.Europe also wants access to key U.S. sectors such as maritime transport and aviation, while American negotiators have been frustrated over lack of access to some 200 European sectors ranging from healthcare to education.The two sides also are far apart on how to resolve disputes. The U.S. side favors a traditional binding arbitration approach, while the Europeans want a court-like system that allows for appeals.More progress has been made on harmonizing regulations for things like car seat belt anchors, clothes labeling and pharmaceutical inspections.
