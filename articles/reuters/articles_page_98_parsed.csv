By Dan Levine
| SAN FRANCISCO

SAN FRANCISCO California Governor Jerry Brown on Friday signed a bill to allow businesses across the state to carry epinephrine auto-injectors, but sharply admonished drugmaker Mylan NL over its recent price increases.Mylan has been widely criticized, including by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, for raising the price of EpiPens, which are carried by people with life-threatening allergies.The company, which acquired the product in 2007, recently raised the list price for a pair of EpiPen auto-injectors to $600. The price has been rising from a cost of about $100 in 2008. A probe into EpiPen pricing by a U.S. Senate subcommittee was announced on Sept. 7.Brown's decision on Friday highlights the predicament facing allergy advocates, who strongly support epinephrine access legislation but have criticized Mylan's pricing. 
Over two dozen U.S. states have passed laws similar to California's authorizing businesses to stock epinephrine, according to advocacy group Food Allergy Research & Education. Brown said he was signing the bill because EpiPens save lives, but that he strongly objected to Mylan's pricing.
""State government cannot stop unconscionable price increases, but it can shed light on such rapacious corporate behavior,"" Brown said in a statement.A Mylan representative could not immediately be reached for comment.
EpiPen, which has annual sales of about $1 billion, delivers a potentially life-saving dose of epinephrine by injection into the thigh to counter dangerous allergic reactions, including to peanuts and bee stings. Mylan owns 94 percent of the market for such auto-injected devices.    In response to the furor over pricing, Mylan last month said it would sell its own generic version of EpiPen for $300.

By Joseph Ax
| PHILADELPHIA

PHILADELPHIA As he seeks re-election to his U.S. Senate seat this November, Pennsylvania's Pat Toomey can make an unusual claim. He is the sole Republican nationwide running with the endorsement of top U.S. gun control advocates Gabby Giffords and Michael Bloomberg.That pair of endorsements could give the first-term senator an edge over Democratic challenger Katie McGinty, a former environmental official in the White House and the Pennsylvania governor's office. The race is one of a handful of close contests on Nov. 8 that could determine whether Republicans, currently with a 54-46 majority, maintain control of the Senate.Both candidates are targeting educated moderate voters, particularly in the Philadelphia suburbs, many of whom may be turned off by the rhetoric of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, according to political analysts in Pennsylvania.McGinty, who calls her support of gun control measures stronger than Toomey's, is working hard to dismiss his endorsements from Giffords and Bloomberg, and has touted her own endorsement by a Pennsylvania anti-gun violence group.Giffords, considered a hero by many gun control advocates, is a Democratic former U.S. congresswoman from Arizona who survived being shot in a 2011 assassination attempt and has become an activist for gun restrictions. Bloomberg is the billionaire former New York City mayor who considered a run for the presidency this year and, since leaving office, has focused much of his energy on gun control.McGinty has called Toomey's commitment to gun safety ""paper thin"" and notes that the Republican incumbent received an ""A"" rating from the influential National Rifle Association gun rights lobbying group during his first Senate run in 2010.The issue of gun rights is potent in a nation where the right to ""keep and bear arms"" is enshrined in Constitution's Second Amendment. The NRA opposes candidates who support gun control efforts including restricting the types of firearms people can own or expanding background checks required for gun buyers. Many Republicans side with the NRA, while many Democrats support gun control.Opinion polls show Toomey's race as virtually tied, even as Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leads Trump by several percentage points in a state that has voted Democratic in the past six presidential contests, starting in 1992.Pennsylvania is home both to rural communities where hunting is a popular pastime and big cities including Philadelphia and Pittsburgh where crime and gun violence are major concerns. Shifting attitudes on guns in the state have emboldened both parties in Pennsylvania to distance themselves from the NRA's stance opposing almost any effort to restrict gun rights.The state's law mandating background checks for private handgun sales already goes beyond federal law, said Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin & Marshall College Poll in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
""Pennsylvania has a very substantial hunting and fishing culture,"" Madonna said. ""But hunters aren't opposed to that.""'HARD THING TO DO'
Toomey's position on guns sets him apart from most of his Republican U.S. Senate counterparts, as he tries to attract moderates while keeping conservative voters in his column.In a telephone interview, Toomey said the Giffords and Bloomberg endorsements recognized ""that what I did was a very hard thing to do politically."" He also emphasized his belief that most gun owners share his position.
""I'm a strong Second Amendment supporter,"" Toomey said. ""I see no contradiction between that support and insisting on background checks, so that people who've got no right to the Second Amendment because they're dangerous criminals or they're dangerously mentally ill or they're terrorists, should be denied a firearm any way we can.""Giffords has also endorsed Illinois Senator Mark Kirk, another Republican running for re-election, though Bloomberg has not weighed in on that race.In an email, McGinty told Reuters Toomey is ""no moderate"" when it comes to gun violence.""Time and again, he has sided with the gun lobby instead of doing what's right to keep communities safe,"" McGinty said. ""Pat Toomey has completely run away from legislation to expand background checks, since it failed to pass the Senate three years ago.""Toomey made headlines in 2013 following an elementary school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, when he and Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia introduced legislation to expand background checks for gun buyers nationwide.
That legislation, fiercely opposed by the NRA, failed in the Senate, but Toomey gained praise from Democrats for bucking the majority of his party.He voted for a similar bill after the mass shooting last year in San Bernardino, California, and supported Republican-backed legislation in Congress this year following the Orlando nightclub shooting to restrict access to firearms for people on official ""terrorism watch lists.""McGinty backed a stricter Democratic-backed version. None of the measures passed.McGinty, who called Toomey's gun control positions weak, favors more sweeping restrictions such as bans on military-style ""assault weapons"" and high-capacity ammunition clips that Toomey opposes.In a recent television ad, McGinty used a clip of Toomey telling voters this summer that he had a ""perfect record"" with the NRA. The NRA has not yet released ratings or issued an endorsement in the race.Toomey called McGinty a ""political opportunist"" and again pointed to his support from Giffords and Bloomberg.""The idea that somehow they've all got it wrong and Katie McGinty, my opponent, has it right is just laughable,"" he said.(This story corrects Senator Mark Kirk's home state to Illinois from Ohio in 15th paragraph.)

By John Whitesides
| LINCOLN PARK, Ga.

LINCOLN PARK, Ga. Louis Brooks, 87, has walked to cast a vote at his neighborhood polling place in Georgia's predominantly black Lincoln Park neighborhood for five decades. But not this year.Brooks says he will not vote in the presidential election for the first time he can remember after local officials moved the polling station more than 2 miles (3 km) away as part of a plan to cut the number of voting sites in Upson County.""I can't get there. I can't drive, and it's too far to walk,"" said Brooks, a black retired mill worker and long-time Democratic Party supporter. He said he does not know how to vote by mail and doesn't know anyone who can give him a ride.A Reuters survey found local governments in nearly a dozen, mostly Republican-dominated counties in Georgia have adopted plans to reduce the number of voting stations, citing cost savings and efficiency.In seven of those counties, African-Americans, who traditionally back Democrats, comprised at least a quarter of the population, and in several counties the changes will disproportionately affect black voters. At least three other counties in Georgia dropped consolidation plans under public pressure.While polling place cutbacks are on the rise across the country, including in some Democratic-run areas, the South's history of racial discrimination has made the region a focus of concern for voting rights advocates.Activists see the voting place reductions as another front in the fight over Republican-sponsored statewide voting laws such as stricter ID requirements that disproportionately affect minority and poorer voters who tend to vote for the Democratic Party.Several of these have recently been struck down by courts that ruled they were designed to hinder minority voting. ""There is a history in those states of using different strategies to cut voting in minority communities,"" said Leah Aden, senior counsel at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Legal Defense and Education Fund.""Hogwash,"" said Robert Haney, chairman of the Upson County Board of Elections, denying that race was a factor in his board's decision.""Nobody is trying to keep anybody from voting,"" said Haney, adding that officials would send a ballot to the home of anyone who needed it. He said the cut in polling sites from nine to four was designed to increase efficiency by closing low-turnout sites, saving about $20,000.The Nov. 8 election will be the first presidential contest since the Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that Georgia and all or parts of 14 other states with a history of racial discrimination no longer need federal approval for election law changes like polling place consolidations.Since the court ruling, the Reuters survey found, more than two dozen local governments in eight of those states have implemented new cuts in polling places. Two thirds of those were met with public opposition.
Four of the states - Arizona, Georgia, Florida and North Carolina - could be election battlegrounds in the fight for the White House and control of the U.S. Senate.    
""IMPACT CAN BE DISASTROUS""
""This is part of the story of voting in the South,"" said Willie Williams, a black small business owner from Daphne, Alabama, where polling stations were cut to two from five during last month's municipal elections over the objections of black voters.Williams, who still keeps his father's receipt for his poll tax - the tax some blacks in the South had to pay to qualify to vote before civil rights laws in the 1960s eliminated it - says the reduction was ""just another tool in the tool kit for shaving off minority votes.""Daphne city officials denied any racial motivation, saying the changes were meant to improve safety and create better access and parking for voters.Still, Isela Gutierrez, a research director at the liberal group Democracy North Carolina, says the effects of such cutbacks can be wide ranging. ""The elections boards aren't lying when they say some of these locations have low turnout and it makes better administrative sense to close them - but the impact can be disastrous.""
Numerous academic studies have found people are less likely to vote the farther they must travel and the longer they must wait in line, which becomes more likely with fewer voting sites.""Some of these changes individually may affect only a small number of voters, but in the aggregate across the country it will be a very large number of voters,"" said Danielle Lang, voting rights counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, a Washington-based voting rights and campaign finance group.The issue gained prominence in a March primary in Arizona's Maricopa County, where more than 30 percent of residents are Hispanic. A decision to slash polling places left voters in lines for up to five hours. Republican county officials said they misjudged turnout.CONSOLIDATIONS 
Georgia has been an epicenter for efforts to reduce polling places since the Supreme Court decision. And in that state, which has not backed a Democrat in a presidential election since 1992, polls show Republican Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in a close battle for the presidency that could be decided by turnout of minority voters.
""If you want to restrict voter turnout in minority and disadvantaged communities, a good way is to move a polling place somewhere they can't get to,"" said Stacey Abrams, Democratic leader in the Georgia state legislature.Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said race was being unfairly inserted into the debate on polling place changes.""It's election officials making adjustments based on the changing ways people are voting,"" he said.    A Reuters analysis, using voter registration lists for 2012 and 2016, found at least two Georgia counties where the changes disproportionately affect blacks.A consolidation plan in Macon-Bibb County closed six polling places in black-majority neighborhoods, and only two in white majority areas. McDuffie County's decision to eliminate three polling places means two-thirds of the county's black voters, and one-third of its white voters, will now vote in one location.Other changes have had little impact on minority voters. In Georgia's Lumpkin County, for example, where blacks are just 2 percent of the population, officials consolidated seven polling locations into one to make the county compliant with federal disability laws.Voting rights groups in several states have tried to form patchwork networks to track the changes, which are not well publicized, and then fight back where necessary with threats of lawsuits, petition drives or complaints to federal officials.In Upson County, Haney said, the elections board dropped a proposal to close a polling site in heavily black Salem, a sparsely populated rural area, after residents pointed out the hardship of traveling an extra 10 miles (16 km) or more.But the Lincoln Park site, which had just 230 voters cast a ballot in person on Election Day 2012, was more easily combined with a polling place in the center of the nearby town of Thomaston, he said.Kay King, the only African-American member of the elections board in Upson County and the only one to vote against the voting site closures, said she knew it meant some Lincoln Park residents would not be able to vote.""They walk to the store, they walk to church - when you don't have transportation to get to something like this, it makes you not want to do it, you just throw your hands up,"" she said.

| CHICAGO

CHICAGO London's first Muslim mayor, Sadiq Khan, voiced support for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Thursday, warning that anti-Muslim views like those espoused by Republican Donald Trump ""plays into the hands"" of Islamic State.During a stop in Chicago on his first visit to the United States, Khan said he was ""a big fan"" of Clinton and hoped she would win the presidential election in November.""She's arguably the most experienced candidate to run to be the president,"" Khan told reporters following a speech to more than 250 academics, diplomats and business people.""As the father of two daughters, I think the message it sends when the most powerful politician in the world is a woman is phenomenal, and hope she wins,"" said Khan, who as mayor of London is arguably one the most influential member of his faith in western Europe.
Immediately after taking office in May, Khan tangled with Trump over his proposed ban on allowing Muslim immigrants and refugees into America, deriding his plan as ""ignorant.""During his roughly 45-minute speech before the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Khan did not mention Trump by name but attacked the positions the New York developer has staked, such as tightening Muslim immigration into the United States.
""I think to suggest somehow that Muslims aren't welcome in the U.S.A., to suggest somehow that being a Muslim isn't compatible with being western, unintentionally plays into the hands of daesh or so-called ISIS,"" Khan said.Trump has offered an evolving stance on Muslim immigration into the United States since his original December 2015 call for a ban on Muslims entering the country.
Earlier this summer, he voiced support for limiting the ban to only countries with known terrorist links. Last month, he appeared to moderate somewhat on an outright ban by touting the idea of the United States undertaking ""extreme vetting"" of incoming Muslim immigrants, refugees or visitors.

By Emily Stephenson and Alana Wise

 (The September 15 story was refiled to correct to $4.4 trillion tax cut, not cost of plan in third paragraph)By Emily Stephenson and Alana WiseRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump unveiled a plan on Thursday for $4.4 trillion in tax cuts, offering less generous tax breaks than his original $10 trillion plan but proposing to cut the current top rate for the wealthiest taxpayers.Trump's proposal, which he detailed in a speech in New York, would reduce the top individual rate to 33 percent from the current 39.6 percent. It would raise the standard deduction and cap itemized deductions, which he said would reduce tax loopholes. Trump said his plan would not add to the federal deficit.Trump said the $4.4 trillion tax cut would actually cost less, about $2.6 trillion, under a mechanism known as dynamic scoring, which assumes that tax cuts will lead to faster growth, which in turn would allow at least some of the tax breaks to pay for themselves.Trump also offered a ""Penny Plan"" for cutting federal spending. He said he would shrink government programs outside of defense by 1 percent each year. But entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare would be shielded from any cuts.The original tax plan laid out by the New York businessman last September was criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike for its costly price tag. Democrat Hillary Clinton, who will face Trump in the Nov. 8 election, denounced it as catering to the very wealthy and ignoring the working class.Some economists also questioned the assumptions underpinning the plan he outlined on Thursday.
In his speech to the Economic Club of New York, Trump predicted his updated package to reduce taxes, curb government regulation and take a tougher stance on negotiating trade agreements would produce annual economic growth of 3.5 percent.""Everything that is broken today can be fixed, and every failure can be turned into a great success,"" Trump said.He added the plan would create 25 million jobs over a decade. Trump set 4 percent as a goal for economic growth, in a message reminiscent of that of his former Republican rival Jeb Bush.
The U.S. economy last achieved 4 percent growth during the administration of Democratic President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. The economy grew 2.4 percent last year.'IT DOESN'T SQUARE'
Oren Cass, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute and domestic policy director of Republican Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential bid, said the plan for 1 percent cuts in some programs would not be enough to pay for Trump's proposals.
""It doesn't square,"" Cass said. ""The penny plan is an idea that's been out there for a while, but it does touch entitlement spending as well.""Maya MacGuineas, president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, welcomed the scaling back of Trump's original tax-cut proposals but said the plan would still leave the country on an unsustainable budget path.""He's moving in the right direction by pursuing a less costly tax plan and identifying some spending cuts to help pay for it. But the plan appears to rely on rosy assumptions and murky policy changes,"" she said in a statement.Other groups have predicted more adverse effects from Trump's policies. Earlier this week, global economic research firm Oxford Economics projected the U.S. economy could be $1 trillion smaller than otherwise expected in 2021 if Trump becomes president.

By Jason Lange
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Apple Inc and other U.S. multinationals will face new curbs on tax loopholes under a rule imposed by Washington on Thursday, part of a scramble among governments worldwide to bolster their corporate tax bases.Acting shortly after a European Union grab for billions of dollars in back taxes from Apple, the U.S. Treasury said it was tightening restrictions on companies' use of foreign tax credits to reduce what they owe in U.S. taxes.""We are closing another tax loophole that contributes to the erosion of our tax base,"" Treasury Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy Mark Mazur said in a statement. The fight for multinational tax revenues escalated on Aug. 30 when the EU ruled Ireland was giving improper state aid to Apple in the form of a deal for low taxes. The EU ordered Apple to pay Ireland 13 billion euros ($14.6 billion) in back taxes, prompting U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to express concern the EU ruling could undermine the U.S. tax base.Analysts have speculated whether Apple would be able to cut its U.S. tax bill by claiming foreign tax credits for its extra tax bill in Ireland. 
Under normal circumstances, U.S. companies can reduce the taxes they owe the U.S. government by the value of the tax credits they claim for taxes paid abroad on foreign profits. No U.S. tax is due on those profits until they are brought into the United States, or repatriated.The new rule will prevent companies faced with back tax bills from ""splitting,"" a strategy that allows companies to bring foreign tax credits into the United States without repatriating the income from which they were derived.
Apple had no comment on Treasury's tax notice. The technology giant is not the only U.S. company in the crosshairs of EU state aid investigations.Starbucks Corp has been ordered to pay up to 30 million euros ($33 million) to the Dutch state, while Amazon.com Inc and McDonald's Corp are under investigation by the EU's executive arm.The new rule was likely to ratchet up transatlantic tensions over corporate taxes while eliminating one more strategy U.S. companies can use to cushion the blow from increasingly aggressive EU tax collection efforts.
The tax notice specifically cited European Union state aid investigations as a risk to U.S. revenues.The Treasury had no comment on whether its notice would have an impact on Apple directly, but a spokesperson said the notice applies to all companies required by a foreign government to pay additional taxes, including those hit by state-aid cases.

By Patrick Graham
| LONDON

LONDON If the fallout from a huge EU tax bill handed to Apple includes a push to encourage U.S. firms to bring more profits onshore, recent history suggests the impact for the dollar can only be positive. U.S. presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have both promised to take steps that would encourage major companies to bring home more of the estimated $2.1 trillion in as-yet-untaxed income they hold offshore. That amount compares to the roughly $300 billion brought back in 2005 under George W. Bush's Homeland Investment Act (HIA), which slashed the effective tax rate on repatriated funds from 35 percent to 5.25 percent. As this graphic tmsnrt.rs/2cymacf shows, the dollar rose around 10 percent that year against both the euro and the basket of currencies that measures its broader strength, even if analysts still argue about how far that move was driven by the tax scheme. Against the yen in the same period it rose 15 percent.  ""The fact that U.S. corporations hold larger cash piles offshore than ever is a reason why a new repatriation tax holiday could be a bigger boost for the dollar than in 2005,"" Morgan Stanley said in a report in July. ""Though we stress the headline number for offshore earnings overstates the unhedged foreign currency amount, which is relevant for FX markets.""
EURO HAVENS
The U.S. bank also lays out tables of data that it says show where the most money has accumulated. Some 56 percent of funds have been reinvested in Europe, including 12 and 19 percent in Ireland and the Netherlands respectively, compared to 7 percent each in traditional tax havens like Bermuda or Singapore.But a trawl through the accounts of the biggest U.S. corporate holders of funds oversees suggests that much of these funds are held in dollars - meaning little or no money would have to be exchanged from, say, euros into dollars. 
Apple, for example, said last year its $186.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were ""generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings"". As of June 30, 92 percent of Microsoft's $113 billion was in U.S. government and agency securities, corporate debt or mortgage-backed securities.Given that in 2004 only around $300 billion of an estimated $500 billion in untaxed offshore funds were brought home, that suggests many firms' repatriations might not involve any foreign exchange at all.
Citigroup chief currency strategist Steven Englander said that even the simple return of dollars to the United States is likely to have a big impact on the currency. ""The dollar money would come back into U.S. equity markets quicker than the non-dollar cash,"" he said. ""It would be very good for U.S. equity markets and would probably attract foreign money into the U.S., pushing up U.S. yields in a risk-friendly way. It would be very dollar-positive.""Englander, who also studied the issue in detail the last time a new repatriation act was being talked up in 2011, says the figure for the amount currently being held abroad is something like $2.5 trillion. Converting even a small share of that huge sum from foreign currencies could be significant.""No one knows the currency breakdown for sure. 80 percent in dollars sounds reasonable. So 20 percent of $2.5 trillion is a big number,"" he added. (Additional reporting by Jamie McGeever; Graphic by Nigel Stephenson; Editing by Catherine Evans)"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

WASHINGTON Five Democratic U.S. Senators have asked Wells Fargo if it plans to take back bonuses and other compensation to executives linked to the 2 million phony bank accounts that employees created to meet sales quotas.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators announced last week that they had reached a $185 million settlement with the bank over the scam.""...We write to ask whether the Board of Directors will invoke Wells Fargo's clawback authority to recover any of the compensation the company has provided to its senior executives, including Carrie Tolstedt, the former senior executive vice president of community banking,"" they wrote in a letter dated Thursday and released on Friday.The five - Massachusetts' Elizabeth Warren, Ohio's Sherrod Brown, Rhode Island's Jack Reed, New Jersey's Robert Menendez, and Oregon's Jeff Merkley - said Wells Fargo has cause to claw back money under a policy it instituted after the 2007-09 financial crisis.
