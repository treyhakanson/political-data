Several women have accused U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump of sexual advances and groping. Among his accusers are a Miss Utah beauty pageant winner, a businesswoman, a reporter and a receptionist. He has denied the accusations.In a 2005 video that emerged on Oct. 7, Trump boasted about grabbing women by the genitals and kissing them without their consent. In a U.S. presidential debate on Oct. 9, he said he was embarrassed by what he called locker-room talk but had not engaged in the conduct he described in the video. Trump has called ""absolutely false"" allegations by several women of groping and other misconduct, reported by The New York Times and other media. He has called the women ""sick,"" and at Wednesday night's final presidential debate, he alleged that the women were either controlled by Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton's campaign or seeking ""their 10 minutes of fame."" Following are some of the allegations against Trump: Jill Harth Houraney, a former Trump beauty pageant business associate, filed a $125 million lawsuit in 1997 against Trump alleging that on Jan. 24, 1993, at Trump's Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, Trump ""forcibly removed plaintiff to a bedroom, whereupon defendant subjected plaintiff to defendant's unwanted sexual advances."" A Trump representative was quoted on Oct. 7 in The New York Times as saying, ""Mr. Trump denies each and every statement made by Ms. Harth."" The lawsuit was dropped in May 1997.Temple Taggart McDowell, a former Miss Utah, was quoted by The New York Times in a report published on May 15 as saying that Trump ""kissed me directly on the lips"" when the two were introduced in 1997, when she was 21. Taggart told the Times, ""I thought, 'Oh my God, gross.'"" The Times story said Trump disputed the report and added that Trump said ""he is reluctant to kiss strangers on the lips.""
Jessica Leeds, 74, recounted in an video interview posted on The New York Times website on Oct. 12 that Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt on a flight to New York in or around 1980 when she was a 38-year-old traveling businesswoman. In a tweet and in a later speech on Oct. 13, Trump called the Times story a total fabrication.Rachel Crooks, formerly a receptionist at a real estate firm, told The New York Times in a report published on Oct. 12   that Trump ""kissed me directly on the mouth"" in 2005 at Trump Tower in Manhattan when she was 22. In a tweet and in a later speech on Oct. 13, Trump called the Times story a total fabrication.
Natasha Stoynoff, a reporter, wrote a first-person account that described Trump kissing her without her consent in December 2005 at Trump's Florida home, Mar-a-Lago, while she was working on an article about him and his third wife, Melania, for People magazine. In the account published by People on Oct. 12, Stoynoff said ""he was pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat."" In a tweet and in a later speech on Oct. 13, Trump said the episode described did not happen.Mindy McGillivray was cited in an article published in The Palm Beach Post on Oct. 12 that while she was a 23-year-old   photographer's assistant at a Jan. 24, 2003, event at Mar-a-Lago, Trump had grabbed her buttocks. The Palm Beach Post cited a Trump spokesperson as saying, ""This allegation lacks any merit or veracity.""
Summer Zervos, who was a contestant on Trump's reality TV show ""The Apprentice"" in 2006, said at a news conference on Oct. 14 in Las Vegas that Trump tried to get her to lie down on a bed with him when she met him in 2007 to discuss a possible job. Zervos said she complied with a request to sit next to Trump, and, ""He then grabbed my shoulder and began kissing me very aggressively and placed his hand on my breast."" Trump at a rally in North Carolina this month denounced the allegations made by a series of women, calling them fabrications.Kristin Anderson, in a video posted on the website of The Washington Post on Oct. 14, said Trump put his hand up her skirt in a crowded New York nightclub in the early 1990s in an unwanted advance, when she had never even met him. ""He did touch my vagina through my underwear, absolutely,"" Anderson said in the video interview. Trump's campaign did not respond to requests for comments on the allegations at the time they were made public.  Yoga instructor Karena Virginia, at a news conference in New York City on Thursday, said Trump approached her outside the U.S. Open tennis tournament in 1998. They had never met, and she was 27 years old, she said. She alleged that Trump commented on her legs and then touched her breast before she was able to get into a car and be driven away. Trump campaign spokeswoman Jessica Ditto said the accusation was a publicity-seeking attack coordinated with Clinton, and added: ""Voters are tired of these circus-like antics and reject these fictional stories.""

By Steve Holland
| WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. Donald Trump assailed as ""absolutely false"" the allegations by several women that he groped them, and accused Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, the media and lobbyists of engaging in an effort to stop him from winning the White House.With his numbers dropping in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 8 election, the Republican U.S. presidential nominee told supporters at a rally in Florida that his campaign was engaged in ""a struggle for the survival of our nation.""Trump said accusations that he groped women in a series of incidents going back to the 1980s were part of a coordinated attempt to keep him from the Oval Office.    ""These vicious claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false,"" he said, adding that ""the Clintons know it."" He said he would make public at some point evidence to dispute the charges.""I've never met these people. I don't even know who they are. They're made-up stories,"" Trump said later on Thursday during a speech in Ohio. Trump spoke after The New York Times reported that two women said they had endured sexual aggression from him, and several other women made similar allegations in other media outlets.The New York businessman's campaign was already struggling to contain a crisis after a video surfaced last week showing him bragging in 2005 about groping women and making unwanted sexual advances.First lady Michelle Obama criticized Trump in scathing terms in a campaign speech for Clinton in New Hampshire on Thursday.Her voice close to cracking with emotion, Obama said, ""This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior, and actually bragging about kissing and groping women, using language so obscene that many of us were worried about our children hearing it when we turn on the TV.""""It's one of countless examples of how he has treated women his whole life,"" she added. ""... The shameful comments about our bodies, the disrespect of our ambitions and intellect, the belief that you can do anything you want to a woman -- it is cruel.""One woman, Jessica Leeds, appeared on camera on The New York Times website to recount how Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt on a flight from the Midwest to New York in or around 1980. (nyti.ms/2dx8k5R)Leeds told CNN on Thursday that Trump also kissed her face in an incident that lasted about 15 minutes. ""That's long enough,"" she said.The second woman, Rachel Crooks, described how Trump ""kissed me directly on the mouth"" in an unwanted advance in 2005 at Trump Tower in Manhattan, where she was a receptionist at a real estate firm.
Reuters could not independently verify the incidents. Leeds and Crooks did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters.The New York Times said on Thursday it stood by its story and rejected charges the article was libelous after a lawyer for Trump threatened legal action and demanded a retraction.        SLUMP IN POLLS
Trump has slumped in opinion polls in recent days as the uproar over the video threatened to engulf his White House campaign in a way that his earlier controversies had not.A Reuters/Ipsos survey showed one in five Republicans thought Trump's comments about groping women disqualified him from the presidency. The poll showed him 8 percentage points behind Clinton among likely voters. Trump trailed Clinton by up to 11 percentage points in other polls. 
Establishment Republicans have struggled to get behind Trump, alarmed by both his style and some of his policy proposals.Within hours of The New York Times report, several other media outlets published similar reports. People magazine published a detailed first-person account from one of its reporters, Natasha Stoynoff. (bit.ly/2dTm90D)Stoynoff said Trump pinned her against a wall at his Florida estate in 2005 and kissed her as she struggled to get away. ""I turned around, and within seconds, he was pushing me against the wall, and forcing his tongue down my throat,"" Stoynoff said. Trump, 70, denied the People story in a Twitter message and in his speech in Florida on Thursday, and mocked the writer.""I ask her a simple question. Why wasn't it part of the story that appeared 12 years ago? Why didn't they make it part of the story ... if she had added that, it would have been the headline.""
""Look at her and look at her words,"" he said. ""You tell me what you think. I don't think so.""Trump's wife, Melania, on Thursday posted on Twitter a letter from her attorney to People that said details in the story were false, pointing to Stoynoff's recollection in the piece that she later ran into Melania Trump and spoke to her in New York City. The attorney, Charles Harder, said in the letter that Stoynoff and Melania Trump ""were never friends or even friendly"" and demanded that People ""print a prominent retraction and apology.""The Palm Beach Post reported an allegation by Mindy McGillivray, 36, a woman in South Florida, that Trump had grabbed her bottom 13 years ago while she was working at his Mar-a-Lago estate as a photographer's assistant.""There is no truth to this whatsoever,"" Trump's spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, told the Post.McGillivray could not be reached for comment.At the Florida rally on Thursday, Trump said he had been prepared for attacks, but ""I never knew it would be this vile, that it would be this bad, that it would be this vicious."" He said the ""corrupt political establishment"" was trying to stop him so it could carry out a program of ""radical globalization and the disenfranchisement of working people.""    ""Our great civilization, here in America and across the civilized world has come upon a moment of reckoning,"" he said. In the 2005 video, Trump bragged about groping women, kissing them without permission, and trying to seduce a married woman. He said during a presidential debate on Sunday that he had not actually done the things he had boasted about, and apologized for his remarks, which he called private ""locker room talk.""The Washington Post endorsed Clinton on Thursday. ""In the gloom and ugliness of this political season, one encouraging truth is often overlooked: There is a well-qualified, well-prepared candidate on the ballot ... we endorse her without hesitation,"" it said.

By Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Barbara Comstock is trying to untether herself from Donald Trump in her re-election bid for the U.S. Congress, but the Virginia Republican's struggles show how difficult that can be.Comstock represents a wealthy House of Representatives district in northern Virginia where Trump has become a burden, one that her opponent is wrapping around Comstock's neck.In local campaign ads, Democratic challenger LuAnn Bennett takes every opportunity to tie Comstock to the New York real estate developer and Republican presidential nominee.The strategy may be working. The Cook Political Report, a non-partisan election tipsheet, moved the Comstock-Bennett race from ""lean Republican"" to ""toss up"" on Wednesday, citing Trump's unpopularity in much of the district.This is despite Comstock's months-long effort to jettison Trump. In April, the former lobbyist and state legislator said Trump was actually a Democrat who knows ""nothing"" about the economy.She said in December that his plan to ban Muslim immigrants was ""un-American"" and ""a silly idea."" In March, she gave campaign donations she got from Trump to charity.Earlier this month, she said Trump's boasts about groping women, revealed in a video tape, were ""vile."" She said she would not vote for him and urged Trump to drop out of the race against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.But it may be too late to undo the damage, political analysts said, with just 19 days remaining until Election Day.
""In a normal year, Comstock would be a clear favorite, but right now her front runner status is in question because of Trump,"" said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the Virginia Center for Politics.    ""He (Trump) was a gift"" to her campaign, said Bennett, a 63-year-old real estate executive.Bennett said Comstock, 57, waited too late in her re-election campaign to announce she would not vote for Trump, and argued that Comstock's views on immigration, abortion and climate change are ""shockingly similar"" to Trump's.Asked on Wednesday about voters' view of her repudiation of Trump, Comstock said Bennett, if elected to the House, would be a ""rubber stamp"" for Clinton.
""I'm the only one of the two of us who ... has a record of speaking out against people, whether it's in my own party or not,"" Comstock, a Georgetown University-educated lawyer, told reporters after a debate with Bennett.""I've made clear that I'm going to be my own woman.""Stretching from suburban Washington to the Shenandoah valley and the West Virginia border, Comstock's district is home to thousands of government workers, as well as many well-heeled lobbyists and what Trump might call the Washington ""elites."" The area has been represented by a Republican in Congress since 1981, but has been a swing district in presidential years.
Bennett said Democrats expect about 140,000 more voters to turn out in the district in this presidential election year than when Comstock was elected in a mid-term election two years ago.""We have a growing Latino community, we have a growing Asian community, and those communities are very unsettled by the rhetoric they've heard on the Republican side of the fence, and really worried about where this country is going,"" she said.Kondik said, ""This is one of the most highly educated districts in the country, and it's filled with the kinds of Republicans that Trump could very well turn off.""A recent poll by the Wason Center for Public Policy in Newport News, Virginia, showed Clinton leading Trump by 55 percent to 21 percent in northern Virginia.That suggests that for Comstock to win, some Clinton backers will need to ""split"" their tickets to vote for Comstock, who made a name for herself in the 1990s as a congressional staffer dedicated to investigating members of the Clinton administration.Stephen Farnsworth, professor of political science and international affairs at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia, said: ""With the lewd tape, Trump went from being a drag on the Comstock campaign to an anchor.""

Asked on Wednesday at his final debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton if he would accept a losing outcome, Trump said he would ""keep you in suspense.""

By Amy Tennery
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump stirred social media ire on Wednesday after he said: ""We have some bad hombres here"" and referred to Democratic rival Hillary Clinton as ""such a nasty woman.""The remarks during the third and final presidential debate came as Trump struggles to attract support from Latinos and women ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election.During the face-off in Las Vegas, Trump repeated his call for tougher security at the Mexican border, saying: ""We have to keep the drugs out of our country."" Adding he would also go after major drug dealers in the United States, he said: ""We have some bad hombres here and we're going to get them out.""Social media users quickly seized on the remark.""This #BadHombres is the first of his family to graduate from college, did Americorps & taught in public schools,"" tweeted Jose N Miranda.""Sometimes I forget this is a presidential debate and not an SNL (Saturday Night Live) skit #badhombres,"" wrote Twitter user Ian Mayberry.The term ""Bad Hombres"" became one of the most-discussed topics of the night on U.S. social media and was tweeted out about 134,000 times during and immediately after the debate, according to digital marketing technology company Amobee.
Trump has aroused criticism for inflammatory comments about Mexican illegal immigrants during his presidential bid. During a speech to kick off his campaign in June 2015, Trump accused Mexico of sending rapists and other criminals to the United States.In late August, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto met with the Republican nominee and said later that Trump's policies ""could represent a huge threat to Mexico.""'SUCH A NASTY WOMAN'

Later in the debate, Trump interjected as Clinton said she would raise taxes on the wealthy to help fund the U.S. government's Social Security retirement program and that Trump would be paying higher taxes too unless he could get out of it.""Such a nasty woman,"" he said. The comment struck many online as sexist, with over 300,000 tweeting the phrase ""nasty woman"" by the early hours of Thursday.
""Calling someone a 'nasty woman' on live television is so deeply and unbelievably offensive,"" tweeted Danielle Suchet. ""'What a nasty woman.' That was the viscerally, awful, genuine part,"" wrote Jake Swanton.Trump's campaign was shaken by the recent release of a 2005 tape in which he boasted of kissing and touching women without their consent. Several women have since charged that he groped them, allegations he has described as ""absolutely false.""(This version of the story has been refiled to clarify Amobee company role) (Reporting by Amy Tennery; Editing by Peter Cooney)"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

By Ami Miyazaki and J.R. Wu
| TOKYO/TAIPEI

TOKYO/TAIPEI Women in the Asia-Pacific region expressed dismay on Thursday about the U.S. presidential campaign's focus on the emotional topic of sexual harassment, saying it shows both democracy and the rights of women in America have some way to go.In a fiery final debate on Wednesday night in Las Vegas, Republican nominee Donald Trump accused Democrat rival Hillary Clinton's campaign of orchestrating a series of accusations by women who said the businessman had made unwanted sexual advances. Clinton, who would be America's first female president, said the women came forward after Trump said he had never made unwanted advances on women. His denial came after a 2005 video surfaced earlier this month in which he was recorded bragging about groping women against their will.Hsiao Bi-khim, a lawmaker from Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party, said she found it ""rather incredible"" Trump had survived politically in the face of the allegations.If a candidate in Taiwan was caught on tape making similar remarks, ""I don't think such a person would survive a presidential campaign,"" she said.Taiwan in January elected its first woman president, Tsai Ing-wen, and on gender equality at least, appears more advanced politically than the United States, she said.""Not only have we elected a woman president, but we have a higher percentage of women who are independently involved in politics and in leadership positions,"" Hsiao said.BREAKING GLASS CEILING
Japan's former minister for gender equality, Kuniko Inoguchi, said the rest of the world has been dismayed to see the U.S. campaign devolve into ""a downgraded debate on women's issues"" and it wouldn't be happening if Clinton were a man running for president.""So when the glass ceiling breaks, there are a lot of injuries that a woman must bear,"" Inoguchi said.Mari Miura, a Sophia University political science professor specializing in women's issues, said Japanese politicians have also sparked outrage for comments demeaning women in the past.
""We hear such comments constantly from Japanese conservative men,"" she said. ""There are so many incidents that people get used to it and it's easier to let it go.""A study commissioned by Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, published in March, found 28.7 percent of women had experienced some form of sexual harassment, and 40 percent of those said they had experienced unwanted touching.'TRAGEDY FOR WOMEN EVERYWHERE'
South Korea, which in 2012 elected its first woman president, Park Geun-hye, has slowly become more accepting of women politicians, said Park Young-sun, a female senior member of the Democratic Party of Korea, which has a majority in parliament.Park Young-sun said that when she first entered parliament, in 2004, female lawmakers were considered ""decorative items on display"".
""They were given positions within the parties like flowers being placed decoratively here and there. Now it's better."" Nurul Izzah, a Malaysian member of parliament and daughter of jailed opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, said the U.S. campaign debate was ""a tragedy for women everywhere"".Nurul said ""there is a lot of condescension, prejudice"" in Malaysian politics, but ""political attacks are not really focused on gender-specific issues"".A senior female member of Indonesian President Joko Widodo's government said what Trump has been accused of doing with women ""would make him definitely unelectable in Indonesia"".""What shocks me is that many Americans still accept him and make excuses for him.""She said sexual assault is not part of Indonesia's political culture, ""and even if there are instances, it is not tolerated, and it doesn't sit well with either men or women"".
'EVE-TEASING'
India, where sexual harassment and groping on public transport is known as ""Eve-teasing"", went through its own soul-searching over the issue after the death of a young woman who was gang-raped on a moving bus in New Delhi in 2012.""In our climate, a Donald Trump-like figure would have to apologize publicly,"" said Maya Mirchandani, foreign affairs editor at NDTV, a leading news channel.When she started in TV news in the 1990s, young female reporters were called ""soundbite soldiers"", she said. ""Print journalists alleged that we used our bodies to stop politicians and get them to talk to us.""Today, Indian law sets clear guidelines for companies to ensure harassment in the workplace is dealt with, she said.Even Australia, known for its colorful language and no-holds barred political culture, has been shocked by the U.S. presidential campaign, said Ged Kearney, female president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions.The closest Australia has come to anything similar recently was a 'ditch the witch' campaign adopted by supporters of the conservative opposition against former prime minister Julia Gillard, Australia's first prime minister, when she argued for a carbon tax during her time in power from 2010 to 2013.""Personally, I think Donald Trump would definitely be unelectable in Australia,"" Kearney said. ""I don't think there is any place in Australia for that level of misogyny and cheapening of politics.""

By Ginger Gibson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democrat Hillary Clinton accused Republican presidential rival Donald Trump on Wednesday of being a ""puppet"" for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose country has been accused by U.S. intelligence officials of meddling in the U.S. election.Putin has been repeatedly thrust into the campaign for the Nov. 8 U.S. election. Trump has praised him as a stronger leader than U.S. President Barack Obama, drawing criticism from Clinton and some Republicans that he is too cozy with the Russian president. Trump has also refused to concede that Russia was behind the hacking of Democratic Party emails.During Wednesday's presidential debate, Trump said he did not know Putin but would likely get along better with the Russian leader than Clinton, a former secretary of state.""He said nice things about me,"" Trump said. ""He has no respect for her, he has no respect for our president and I'll tell you what, we're in very serious trouble.""Clinton responded: ""Well that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.""
""No, you're the puppet,"" Trump retorted, adding Clinton disliked Putin because he ""has outsmarted her at every step of the way."" Earlier this week, Trump suggested that if elected, his first meeting with a foreign leader would be with Putin.
U.S.-Russian relations have deteriorated in recent years over Moscow's intervention in the Syrian conflict, its annexation of the Crimean region from Ukraine and concerns about cyber attacks.Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who oversees 17 U.S. intelligence agencies, has suggested that recent computer hacks targeting the Democratic Party were perpetrated by Russians, and predicted that cyber attacks would be a pressing challenge for the next president.Putin said on Sunday that Russia did not seek confrontation with the United States and was not trying to influence the U.S. election.

A federal judge in Ohio laid out a plan on Wednesday for the state to restore voting privileges for people who were illegally removed from the state's voter rolls over the past five years.The ruling stems from a case in which the ACLU and other plaintiffs sued, saying Ohio's process for removing people who had died or moved away from voter rolls was illegal because it purged people simply for not voting and not responding to a letter from the state.Voting rights cases have become pivotal battlegrounds ahead of the Nov. 8 election between Democrat Hillary Clinton and  Republican Donald Trump.The American Civil Liberties Union and others have challenged laws in Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina over voting rights issues.In the Ohio case, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati said Ohio's process for removing inactive voters was illegal, reversing an earlier ruling by U.S. District Judge George C. Smith.
In response, Smith on Wednesday ordered the state to allow people who had been removed from the rolls to cast provisional ballots on election day.Those ballots will be checked against voter rolls, and if people were purged in the years 2011, 2013 or 2015, their votes will be counted and their registration restored.
""They'll have to put a provisional ballot which will take a little more time but if they do that, that vote will count,"" said Stuart Naifeh, an attorney with Demos, a voter rights and income inequality advocacy group that was among those suing over the policy.Joshua Eck, a spokesman for Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, said the solution was a workable one because it did not require the wholesale restoration of voting privileges to people who had moved away, died or otherwise become ineligible to vote.

By Jane Ross

LAS VEGAS - As Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump prepared to go head-to-head with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in their third and final debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday, hundreds of hospitality workers and protesters gathered outside the hotel Trump co-owns near the Las Vegas Strip. Demonstrators waved signs and banners next to what organizers called a ""wall"" of taco trucks. That was a reference to Trump's proposal to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico, as well as a riff on comments by Trump supporter Marco Gutierrez who said that without action on immigration reform, ""You're going to have taco trucks on every corner.""""We have fought for our rights and we don't want Donald Trump to take them away from us,"" said Las Vegas resident Miguel Faria. ""If this man gets the presidency then everything will be ruined."" Several protesters wore sashes printed with the phrases ""Miss Piggy"" and ""Miss Housekeeping,"" using the names that Clinton has said Trump called a former beauty queen who had gained weight and who was Latina.The protest was organized by the Culinary Union, which represents about 57,000 workers in Nevada, the majority of whom are Latino.
Luis Hernandez, a musician with the norteno band ""Los Tigres del Norte,"" encouraged Latino voters to head to the polls on Nov. 8. ""We can't just go on hoping someone will vote on our behalf,"" he told Reuters. ""We need to go out and vote because the Hispanic vote is going to make the difference in these elections.""
Among the speakers at the protest was civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who said he hoped the candidates would stick to policies at Wednesday's debate, instead of attacking each other.""We all as Americans live under one big tent. Hillary represents that higher ground. I hope that tonight they will not wallow in snake politics but will fly like eagles and take us all to higher ground,"" Jackson told Reuters. According to Bethany Khan, the Culinary Union's communications director, workers at the Trump International Hotel voted to unionize in December 2015 but still do not have a contract. 
Some protesters blamed that on Trump, who owns 50 percent of the property. ""He says he's the greatest negotiator but he's not coming to the table to support the workers that give him money and make a profit for him,"" said Maria Teresa Liedermann.
