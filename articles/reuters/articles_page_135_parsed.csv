By Amanda Becker and James Oliphant
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Wednesday accused Republican opponent Donald Trump of inciting violence with his call for gun rights activists to stop her from nominating liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices.Clinton's comments added to a growing outcry over Trump's remarks on Tuesday at a North Carolina rally, which some interpreted as a call for violence against his White House rival. His remarks also fueled widespread concerns about his ability to stay on track.""Words matter, my friends,"" the former U.S. secretary of state, who rarely engages in direct back-and-forths with her Republican rival, said at a rally in Des Moines, Iowa. ""And if you are running to be president or you are president of the United States, words can have tremendous consequences.""""Yesterday, we witnessed the latest in a long line of casual comments from Donald Trump that crossed the line,"" she said, citing ""his casual inciting of violence.""Trump insisted in an interview with Fox News that his remarks were a call for political, not physical, action.""There is tremendous political power to save the Second Amendment, tremendous,"" the New York businessman said. ""And you look at the power they have in terms of votes and that's what I was referring to, obviously that's what I was referring to, and everybody knows it.""The U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment guarantees a right to keep and bear arms.""I can't think of anything remotely comparable to it. No one tells a joke about the opponent getting shot. I've never heard it,"" said Bob Shrum, a top aide for Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000 and John Kerry's in 2004.REPUBLICANS SHAKEN
High-profile Republicans and rank-and-file voters appeared shaken on Wednesday after a string of Trump misfires, struggling with how to best reject his divisive candidacy. Some pledged to withhold their endorsement and others backed Clinton. Some, including MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman from Florida, called for party leaders to replace Trump on the ticket.
A new Reuters/Ipsos poll taken Aug. 5-8 - before Trump's latest controversy - showed that nearly one-fifth of 396 registered Republicans said they want Trump to drop out of the race and another 10 percent said they ""don't know"" whether the Republican nominee should or not.Clinton's campaign, seeing an opening, has moved to bring disenchanted Republicans into the fold by announcing an official intraparty outreach effort on behalf of the Democratic nominee.Clinton's campaign now has a website for Republicans and political independents to sign up to pledge their support, listing 50 prominent Republicans and independents who have endorsed her.On Monday, 50 Republican national security officials signed an open letter questioning Trump's temperament, calling him reckless and unqualified to be president.    Other top Republicans, including Senator Susan Collins of Maine this week, have disavowed Trump but said they cannot back Clinton.James Rohrscheib, 74, a registered Republican and retired U.S. Navy officer from Washington state, told Reuters the reality is the Nov. 8 election will be a ""tough one.""""I'm in a quandary as to who I am going to vote for,"" Rohrscheib said.
Trump has dismissed the defections and criticism as an unsurprising reaction of the so-called Washington elite to his drive to change the status quo.One group that appears unswayed is Trump's donors. Reuters interviewed nine major Trump donors on Wednesday, and not one said his Second Amendment comment had given them pause.Trump Texas fundraising co-chair Gaylord Hughey called the interpretation of his remark as condoning violence ""ridiculous"" and ""ludicrous.""""It's just another issue the press has really twisted to make headlines,"" Hughey said.But Mike Smith, a Republican voter and Reuters/Ipsos poll respondent, said the support Trump is still receiving from Republicans ""almost seems obligatory rather than voluntary.""""I'm almost at the point where I think I'm going to vote for Hillary. I don't like her,"" said Smith, a 74-year-old retiree who lives in Clearwater, Florida. ""But Mr. Trump is making me very nervous.""
RESET ABANDONED
Republican strategist and Trump supporter Ford O'Connell said Trump has ""dug himself a deep hole"" with voters and to win the election he will need to ""make it a referendum on Hillary Clinton and the 'rigged system.'""Trump sought to do just that by using an economic policy speech in Detroit on Monday to correct a series of missteps that included a prolonged clash with the parents of a fallen Muslim American soldier. But his remarks Tuesday undermined that effort.""If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks,"" Trump said at the rally in North Carolina. ""Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don't know,"" he continued.A federal official familiar with the matter denied a media report that the U.S. Secret Service, which investigates threats against presidents and candidates, had formally spoken with the Trump campaign about his remark.Trump's comment and the resulting backlash occurred as Reuters/Ipsos polling showed some 44 percent of 1,162 registered voters believe Trump should exit the race, and that as of Tuesday, Clinton led Trump by more than 7 percentage points, up from a 3-point lead late last week.Strategists and Trump detractors agreed that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to remove Trump from the Republican ticket.""It's wishful thinking to believe the Republicans are going to replace its nominee after the convention. People are grasping at straws,"" Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist unaffiliated with Trump, told Reuters.A more likely scenario would be a replay of the 1996 presidential race, when the Republican Party essentially deserted nominee Bob Dole, who was badly trailing President Bill Clinton, to focus on congressional races.

By Steve Holland
| FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday tried to raise ethical questions about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and criticized her for letting the father of the Orlando nightclub shooter sit behind her at a rally.At campaign events in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and earlier in Abingdon, Virginia, Trump sought to rally his campaign after a setback on Tuesday when he appeared to suggest gun rights activists should take action against Clinton.On Wednesday he drew attention to the emergence of emails from Clinton's use of a private server when she was secretary of state during President Barack Obama's first term, from 2009-2013.A conservative watchdog group, Judicial Watch, obtained the release through court order of 44 email exchanges that it said were not previously turned over to the State Department.Among them was a 2009 email in which Doug Band, a former official at the Clinton Foundation charity run by former President Bill Clinton, directed two Hillary Clinton aides to put Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire and Clinton Foundation donor Gilbert Chagoury in touch with a State Department official dealing with Lebanon.The Clinton campaign has dismissed the new emails as having nothing to do with Clinton or the foundation's work.
Trump, who is trailing in many polls with three months to go until the Nov. 8 election, said the new batch of emails suggested a ""pay for play"" scheme.""You're not allowed to do it,"" he said. ""It's illegal.""Trump also called Obama ""the founder of ISIS"" for not leaving U.S. forces in Iraq and said that made Clinton ""the co-founder.""In addition, he had sharp comments about the seating of Seddique Mateen, the father of Omar Mateen, who shot to death 49 people at an Orlando nightclub in June, behind Clinton at a rally in Kissimee, Florida.
""Wasn't it terrible when the father of the animal who killed the wonderful people was sitting with a big smile on his face right behind Hillary Clinton?"" he said.Trump said he believed that people who sit behind the candidate at rallies are close to the campaign.Reporters noticed that sitting behind Trump at the event in Fort Lauderdale was former U.S. Representative Mark Foley, who resigned from Congress in 2006 after allegations surfaced that he had sent suggestive emails and sexually explicit instant messages to teenage boys who had been congressional pages.
Foley told the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel he has been a long-time friend of Trump's and has found him to be ""a different breed of leader and a different breed of candidate.""    Trump sharply criticized the news media for the way it handled a comment he made in Wilmington, North Carolina, on Tuesday suggesting gun rights supporters could take action against Clinton.""I would actually say that the media is almost as crooked as crooked Hillary Clinton,"" Trump said.He drew harsh criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike because some took his remarks on Tuesday to mean he was inciting violence despite Trump's insistence he was only urging more people to rally votes against Clinton.

By Alana Wise
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A federal official on Wednesday said the U.S. Secret Service had not formally spoken with Republican Donald Trump's presidential campaign regarding his suggestion a day earlier that gun rights activists could stop Democratic rival Hillary Clinton from curtailing their access to firearms.Following Trump's comment at a rally on Tuesday in which he suggested that gun rights activists could stop Clinton from appointing liberal anti-gun justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, a federal official familiar with the matter told Reuters that there had been no formal conversations between the Secret Service and the Trump campaign.Earlier CNN had reported that there had been multiple conversations between the campaign and the agency.
""If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks,"" Trump told a North Carolina campaign rally on Tuesday. ""Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don't know,"" he added, leading some critics to believe Trump was referring to gun violence against his rival. The controversy came as the campaign tried to stay on message after a contentious previous week. Trump weathered criticism within his own party for delaying endorsements of fellow Republicans and for a prolonged clash with the family of a fallen Muslim American U.S. Army captain. 
The campaign denied that inciting violence had been the intent of Tuesday's remark, and on Wednesday said there had been no conversations with the Secret Service about it. 
""No such meeting or conversation ever happened,"" Trump wrote on Twitter, accusing CNN of having made up the report.  (Reporting by Alana Wise; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Sandra Maler)"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

By Grant Smith
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Nearly one-fifth of registered Republicans want Donald Trump to drop out of the race for the White House, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday, reflecting the turmoil his candidacy has sown within his party.Some 19 percent think the New York real estate magnate should drop out, 70 percent think he should stay in and 10 percent say they ""don't know,"" according to the Aug. 5-8 poll of 396 registered Republicans. The poll has a confidence interval of six percentage points.Among all registered voters, some 44 percent want Trump to drop out. That is based on a survey of 1,162 registered voters, with a confidence interval of 3 percentage points. That is 9 points higher than his support for the presidency in the latest Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll. The figures underscored deep divisions within the Republican Party over Trump's candidacy. A number of prominent Republicans have declined to endorse him in the Nov. 8 election against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, citing his fiery rhetoric and  policy proposals such as building a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border and temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country.Mike Smith, a 74-year-old retiree from Clearwater, Florida, said he supported Trump for much longer than he should have, but now feels the candidate should drop out of the race. Trump ""has not comported himself as a leader,"" said Smith, adding that he might vote for Clinton over his party's nominee.""His policies don't seem to be well formed, they don't seem to make any sense,"" Smith said. ""The support he has from Republicans almost seems obligatory rather than voluntary.""Trump found himself embroiled in yet another controversy on Tuesday after saying at a rally that gun rights activists could act to stop Clinton from nominating liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices - a comment his campaign said was misinterpreted, but that Clinton's campaign called ""dangerous.""
""If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks,"" Trump said at the rally at the University of North Carolina. ""Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don't know,"" he continued. The U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment guarantees a right to keep and bear arms.Megan MacDonald, 25, is a Republican but did not support Trump through the primary. He has not done anything since to change her mind, and believes he should leave the race. ""I just feel there are so many derogatory things that have come out of his mouth, and he's putting it out there - it's not like someone is finding skeletons in his closet,"" said MacDonald, a stay-at-home mom in Louisiana, who may pick a third-party candidate. ""It feels like he's not even trying to be a decent person who we should look up to.""
Trump had previously stirred criticism for engaging in a spat with the parents of a Muslim U.S. soldier killed in Iraq. In addition, 50 prominent national security experts signed an open letter saying they would not vote for Trump in the fall, saying he ""lacks the character, values, and experience"" to be president. Trump dismissed the group as part of the Washington establishment that he blames for many of the United States' problems.Stacie McDaniel, 42, said Trump's rhetoric has, at times, made her think he should drop out of the race. ""Sometimes I think he has good intentions, but his mouth gets overloaded,"" said McDaniel, a relocation director for a real estate company in Louisiana. ""I think he says things that if he does get elected, he's not going to get anything done.""
Still, she plans to vote for Trump, she said, because she cannot bring herself to support Clinton. ""I dislike Hillary so much,"" she said. ""As the lesser of two evils is why I'm voting for him.""Indeed, neither Trump nor Clinton enjoys great popularity. Some 53 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of Clinton, who has been accused of mishandling her emails as secretary of state, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. Nearly 63 percent have an unfavorable view of Trump.Clinton led Trump by more than 7 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, up from a less than 3-percentage-point lead late last week.

By Joseph Ax
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK A former aide to Chris Christie said in a text message that the New Jersey governor ""flat out lied"" when he said senior staff members were not involved in the ""Bridgegate"" scandal in 2013, according to a court filing on Wednesday.The details were revealed in a document filed in New Jersey federal court by Bill Baroni, former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, who is one of two former Christie allies facing trial next month on Bridgegate-related criminal charges.Speculation has persisted for years about whether Christie or members of his staff were aware of an alleged plot to close two New York City-bound lanes at the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee as retribution against Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat who had refused to back the Republican governor's re-election campaign.Christie addressed the controversy at a Dec. 13, 2013, news conference, a day after the state legislature issued several subpoenas in its investigation of the lane closures.""I've made it very clear to everybody on my senior staff that if anyone had any knowledge about this that they needed to come forward to me and tell me about it, and they've all assured me that they don't,"" Christie said at the time.Christina Renna, former director of Christie's intergovernmental affairs office, immediately sent a text message to Peter Sheridan, a member of Christie's re-election campaign, according to the filing.
""Are you listening? He just flat out lied about senior staff and Stepien not being involved,"" her first text said, referring to Bill Stepien, who managed Christie's two gubernatorial campaigns.In a subsequent text, Renna said ""it could be bad"" if emails were later uncovered through a subpoena or court discovery.Christie would apologize weeks later at another news conference, when he said he was firing his deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, and that he had been ""lied to"" when he told reporters no one on his staff was involved.
He also cut ties with Stepien, saying at the news conference that he had lost confidence in Stepien's judgment. Stepien has not been charged in the case.""The governor's statements have been clear,"" a Christie spokesman, Brian Murray, said on Wednesday. ""Nothing contained in this text message changes that in any way.""A lawyer for Renna, now vice president of the Chamber of Commerce Southern New Jersey, said she would not address the issue until she testifies at the upcoming criminal trial for Baroni and Kelly.
Kevin Marino, a lawyer for Stepien, called the suggestion he might have been involved in Bridgegate ""categorically false and irresponsible.""Sheridan, who works for the state Republican party, did not respond to a request for comment.Jury selection will begin Sept. 12 for Baroni and Kelly, who face charges including conspiracy and fraud. Another former Port Authority official, David Wildstein, has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with federal prosecutors.

A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday suspended a July 19 ruling by a federal judge that struck down parts of Wisconsin's voter ID law, the Department of Justice said.Under the ruling by U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman, Wisconsin voters who did not have photo identification would have been able to vote in the Nov. 8 presidential election.A Justice Department statement said that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit issued a stay concluding ""both that the district court's decision is likely to be reversed on appeal and that disruption of the state's electoral system in the interim will cause irreparable injury.""Wisconsin is one of several Republican-led states that have passed voter ID laws in recent years amid fear of fraudulent voting by illegal immigrants and others. The nine states with the strictest laws, insisting on state-issued photo identification for voters, include Texas, Virginia, Indiana and Georgia.
Republicans say voter ID laws are needed to prevent voter fraud. But Democrats say the laws are really intended to make it more difficult for poor African-Americans and Latinos, who skew Democratic in their politics, to vote.Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, a Republican, called Wednesday's appeals court decision ""a step in the right direction.""
""Voters in Wisconsin support voter ID, and our administration will continue to work to make it easy to vote and hard to cheat,"" Walker said in a statement.In a separate but related case, another federal judge on July 29 struck down a string of Wisconsin voting restrictions passed by the Republican-led legislature and ordered the state to revamp its voter identification rules, finding that they disenfranchised minority voters.
U.S. District Judge James Peterson, ruling in a legal challenge to the laws by two liberal groups, said he could not overturn the entire voter ID law because a federal appeals court had already found such restrictions to be constitutional.

WASHINGTON Donald Trump's call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States does not tarnish the U.S. commitment to religious freedom in the eyes of foreigners, a State Department official said on Wednesday.On Dec. 7, the week after a Muslim couple killed 14 people in San Bernardino, the Republican called for ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.""Speaking as he presented the State Department annual report on religious freedom, David Saperstein, the U.S. ambassador at large for that issue, was asked whether the comments made his job of promoting religious tolerance in foreign nations harder.""Countries across the globe ... they see clearly the basic constitutional, institutional constraints against violations of religious freedom in the United States, and I think see clearly and believe deeply in America's promise to be a model about treating all people equally without regard to religion,"" Saperstein said.
""That is clear and that is not tarnished by the statements here,"" he added. ""No matter who is elected, the institutions and the United States' constitutional constraints will ensure that we continue along the line we have for the last 200 years.""At the time, Trump's comments were condemned by the White House, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and some of the candidates then vying with Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.
More recently, the parents of a Muslim American Army captain killed in Iraq took Trump to task at the Democratic National Convention over his rhetoric on Muslims, prompting a spat that triggered renewed criticism of the Republican candidate.

By Steve Holland
| WILMINGTON, N.C.

WILMINGTON, N.C. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump suggested on Tuesday that gun rights activists could act to stop Democratic rival Hillary Clinton from nominating liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices, igniting yet another fire storm of criticism just as he sought to steer clear of controversy.""If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks,"" Trump said at a rally. ""Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don't know,"" he continued.The U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment guarantees the right to bear firearms.Before the remark, Trump had been emphasizing his case against Clinton, who is leading in national opinion polls in the race for the Nov. 8 election. Some in the audience in North Carolina who were seated behind Trump could be seen wincing when he made the comment.Clinton's campaign called the remark ""dangerous.""""A person seeking to be the president of the United States should not suggest violence in any way,"" it said.  When asked to clarify what Trump meant, his campaign said he was referring to getting supporters of the Second Amendment to rally votes for Trump in the election.""It's called the power of unification - 2nd Amendment people have amazing spirit and are tremendously unified, which gives them great political power,"" the Trump campaign said in its statement.Immediately after Trump made his comment, many on social media accused him of effectively calling for Clinton's assassination. In just three hours, 2nd amendment became the top trending topic on Twitter, with more than 60,000 posts mentioning the term.Introducing Trump later at another rally in North Carolina, in Fayetteville, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani accused the news media of taking the remark out of context to help Clinton get elected.""What he meant by that was you have the power to vote against her,"" Giuliani said to cheers. ""You have the power to speak against her. You know why? Because you're Americans.""
""It proves that most of the press is in the tank for Hillary Clinton,"" he added. ""They are doing everything they can to destroy Donald Trump.""The U.S. Secret Service, which provides security details for both Trump and Clinton and rarely comments on political matters, when asked for a response on Trump, said: ""The Secret Service is aware of the comment.""     Trump later told Fox News Channel's ""Hannity"" program that ""nobody in that room"" thought he meant anything other than to rally support against Clinton.""This is a strong powerful movement, the Second Amendment,"" Trump said. ""Hillary wants to take your guns away. She wants to leave you unprotected in your home.  This is a tremendous political movement.""By day's end, Trump was drawing criticism on several fronts, another chapter in a campaign marked by bitterness and  partisanship.Michael Hayden, a former CIA director who on Monday was among 50 Republican national security experts to denounce Trump in a letter, said on CNN, ""You're not just responsible for what you say. You are responsible for what people hear.""
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a liberal firebrand who loves tweaking Trump, tweeted that the Republican nominee ""makes death threats because he's a pathetic coward who can't handle the fact that he's losing to a girl.""Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway fought back in a tweet of her own, calling Warren a ""disgrace.""GUN RIGHTS AN ISSUE
Gun rights, which have long stirred strong emotions in America, have been a particularly potent issue in the 2016 presidential campaign as violence has convulsed some U.S. cities.Trump has planted himself firmly on the side of gun owners with a ""law and order"" campaign. Before his remark about Clinton on Tuesday, he had said Islamic State militants who killed 130 people in France last year could have been stopped if some of the victims had been armed.
The Clinton campaign has challenged Trump when in the past he has accused her of planning to abolish the Second Amendment if elected president. Clinton, in her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, said, ""I'm not here to repeal the Second Amendment,"" saying she wanted ""common-sense reforms"" to gun laws.Tuesday's speech came on the heels of a discordant week on the campaign trail for Trump, a businessman seeking his first public office. He came under fire from within his party for belatedly endorsing fellow Republicans in re-election races and a prolonged clash with the parents of fallen Muslim American Army captain Humayun Khan.On Monday, Trump seemed to be heeding Republican advice to stick to a message of criticizing Clinton and other Democrats while putting forward economic policy proposals in a speech in Detroit.Trump's vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, asked if he believed Trump was inciting violence toward Clinton, told NBC's Philadelphia affiliate: ""Of course not. No.""But Democrats called Trump's remarks another sign of a candidate unfit for the White House.""Don't treat this as a political misstep. It's an assassination threat, seriously upping the possibility of a national tragedy & crisis,"" U.S. Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, said in a tweet.Overall sentiment on social media posts on Trump's remarks was more negative than positive, at a ratio of 2.5 to 1, according to the social media analytics firm Zoomph. #ProtectHillary was also one of the top trending hashtags on Twitter.The 50 prominent national security officials said in their letter on Monday that Trump would be ""the most reckless president in American history.""""He appears to lack basic knowledge about and belief in the U.S. Constitution, U.S. laws and U.S. institutions, including religious tolerance, freedom of the press, and an independent judiciary,"" their statement said.

BERLIN A series of controversial remarks by U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump show that the world should be concerned if he is elected president, a spokeswoman for German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said on Wednesday.Trump, a billionaire businessman seeking his first public office, has courted controversy with a string of inflammatory statements about women, Mexicans, Muslims and war veterans, among others.Steinmeier, unlike Chancellor Angela Merkel who has said she will not comment on the U.S. election, is not neutral on the issue because he believes it is important to draw attention to the dangers posed by Trump, said spokeswoman Sawsan Chebli.""He is indeed not neutral on this question because he thinks that if you follow what Trump is saying then you need to be really anxious about what could become of this world ... if (he) does in fact become president,"" Chebli told a regular government news conference.
Steinmeier is from the centre-left Social Democrats, the junior partner in Merkel's conservative-led ruling coalition.A spokeswoman for Merkel said the chancellor did not wish to interfere in the U.S. election campaign.
On Monday 50 prominent Republican national security officials, including a former CIA director, described Trump as unqualified to lead the country and said he would be ""the most reckless president in American history"".
