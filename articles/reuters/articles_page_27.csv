Three California cities voted for a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages and another in Colorado was likely to follow suit, unofficial election results showed on Wednesday, as local governments' push to cut soda consumption to stem obesity gathered speed.The votes on so-called soda taxes in San Francisco, Albany and Oakland in California and in Boulder, Colorado, came a month after the World Health Organization recommended governments impose such taxes to battle obesity, diabetes and other diet-related diseases.Tax proponents have recorded a series of victories in the United States this year, after numerous failed attempts.     Opponents argue that the taxes hit lower-income populations hardest, and that it is unfair to single out soda in the battle to fight obesity and diabetes. They also question the effectiveness of such taxes.Larry Tramutola, a California political strategist who  organized the pro-tax campaigns in San Francisco and Oakland, said the victory was ""huge,"" adding: ""This is the start of a national movement.""Philadelphia earlier this year passed a levy on soft drinks, pitched as a way to fill a budget shortfall via a tactic that other politicians and advocates have also adopted.""I'm sure that other cities and states will look at this and put tax measures before their legislatures,"" said Michael Jacobson, co-founder and president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington. ""Legislators will say, 'We get a twofer: balance the budget and improve public health.'""The next soda tax vote is set for Cook County, Illinois, on Thursday.
Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo Inc. and other companies in the roughly $100 billion U.S. soft drink industry are fighting the taxes at a time when soda consumption is falling.They point instead to their efforts to reformulate products and broaden the range of drinks they offer to address consumers' health concerns. More than one-third of U.S. adults are obese.""Our energy remains squarely focused on reducing the sugar consumed from beverages,"" a spokeswoman for the American Beverage Association said in an emailed statement. 
Shares in Pepsi  and Coca Cola  were both down nearly 2 percent, while Dr. Pepper Snapple Group was off 3.4 percent on Wednesday as the Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.9 percent.Spending from both camps has soared this year as billionaire advocates for the tax, including former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, joined the fray.For soda companies, the effects of the taxes on volumes and profits may be muted. In Mexico, which introduced a tax in 2014, per capita consumption dropped after the tax was introduced. But the impact on companies like Pepsi was offset by population growth and strong demand of non-fizzy beverages.""This is more of a headline risk than a fundamental risk. It doesn't have an enormous impact on the companies themselves, as long as the (size of) taxes are within the realm of reason,"" said Ali Dibadj, analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein in New York.
Long-term, the effects could be greater if the taxes are increased and if more jurisdictions introduce them.In San Francisco, Oakland and Albany, the taxes will be a penny per ounce, the same as in neighboring Berkeley, where voters passed a levy in 2014. In Boulder, the vote was for a 2-cent-per-ounce tax.The San Francisco measure passed 62 percent to 38 percent and the Albany measure passed 71 percent to 29 percent. The Oakland measure had 61 percent in favor and 39 percent opposed, and in Boulder the soda tax was passing 54 percent to 46 percent, with over three-quarters of the ballots counted.

| ZURICH

ZURICH Donald Trump's U.S. election victory, on the heels of Britain's vote to exit the European Union, was fuelled by voters who feel neglected and shunned by establishment leaders, prominent Swiss right-winger Christoph Blocher said on Wednesday. Blocher, a top official in the anti-immigration Swiss People's Party who engineered its ascent to become the biggest faction in the Swiss parliament, said Trump's win over Democrat Hillary Clinton was a warning to current world leaders not to go over citizens' heads on issues including immigration.""People feel powerless against those who rule them, and for them, Trump is a release valve,"" Blocher said in an interview. ""The unexpected result ... should give pause to those who are in power around the world."" Next year, the Netherlands, France and Germany - and possibly Italy and Britain too - will hold elections in which debate is likely to be driven by populist parties over issues including immigration. [nL8N1D83Q4]
That was also a central theme in Britain's June 23 ""Brexit"" vote to end 43 years of EU membership. [nU8N1B401J]Non-EU Switzerland is seeking to balance demands by voters in 2014 for immigration quotas for EU workers without torpedoing trade agreements with the bloc.

""When politicians in Berne refuse to take the vote against mass immigration seriously, it will only lead to a shock like it did in America,"" Blocher said.Blocher said Europe's responses to immigration amid violent Islamist attacks in France, Belgium and Germany have helped populist political parties including France's National Front, as well as the Alternative for Germany, gain traction.

By Asad Hashim and Kay Johnson
| ISLAMABAD

ISLAMABAD Donald Trump's surprise election as U.S. president has Pakistanis wary that he may accelerate what they see as a shift in American policy to favor arch-foe India in the long rivalry between nuclear-armed neighbors, analysts said on Wednesday.Historical allies in the region, Islamabad and Washington have seen relations sour over U.S. accusations that Pakistan shelters Islamist militants, a charge Pakistan denies.They hit new lows in May when a U.S. drone killed the leader of the Afghan Taliban movement on Pakistani territory.At the same time, Pakistan's ties with traditional rival India have also deteriorated this year, with India saying Pakistan-based militants killed 19 of its soldiers in a September attack on an army base in the disputed Kashmir region.To many Pakistanis, Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric - he once proposed banning Muslims entering the United States - and business ties to India are signs that his administration could shift further toward New Delhi.""America will not abandon Pakistan, but definitely, Trump will be a tougher president than Hillary Clinton for Pakistan,"" said Hasan Askari Rizvi, Lahore-based foreign policy analyst.""I think India will have a better and smoother interaction compared to Pakistan.""Trump has yet to lay out a detailed policy for South Asia, although he recently offered to mediate between India and Pakistan in their dispute over the divided territory of Kashmir.He also told Fox News in May he would favor keeping nearly 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan ""because it's adjacent and right next to Pakistan which has nuclear weapons.""CONGRATULATIONS, ASSURANCES
On Wednesday, a U.S. diplomat in Pakistan sought to assure the country that Trump's election did not signal a drastic policy change.""Our foreign policy is based on national interest and they don't change when the government changes,"" Grace Shelton, U.S. Consul General in Karachi, told Geo News television.Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif congratulated Trump.
""Your election is indeed the triumph of the American people and their enduring faith in the ideals of democracy, freedom, human rights and free enterprise,"" Sharif said in a statement.Still, the uncertainty of a Trump presidency has many Pakistanis on edge, even if the country has leaned towards China in recent years for investment and diplomatic support.""Trump is a bit of a wild card,"" said Sherry Rehman, a Pakistani senator and former ambassador to the United States.    ""Pakistan obviously cannot rule out engaging with whomever America elects, but his anti-Muslim rhetoric may cast a shadow on relations in times of uncertainty.""INDIA HOPEFUL
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also congratulated Trump on Wednesday. 
""We look forward to working with you closely to take India-US bilateral ties to a new height,"" Modi said in a tweet.Trump has partnered with Indian businessmen on a handful of real estate ventures, but apart from courting the Indian-American vote he has not articulated how he would develop the bilateral relationship.India-U.S. ties have flourished under President Barack Obama and Modi, who came to power in 2014, with the two countries striking key defense agreements this year.Modi's government has also waged a campaign to isolate Pakistan diplomatically.Shaurya Doval, director of the India Foundation, a think-tank close to Modi's government, called Trump's election ""a very positive development"", but added that India and the United States would have continued to grow closer under a Hillary Clinton presidency as well.""My sense is that India-U.S. relations are not dependent on individuals - there are strong institutions and processes there,"" he said.One fringe Hindu nationalist group in India held a victory gathering at New Delhi's speakers' corner on Wednesday.
""He's an American nationalist. We are Indian nationalists. Only he can understand us,"" Rashmi Gupta of the Hindu Sena, or Hindu Army, told Reuters. ""We expect him to support us when it comes to terrorist attacks on India from Pakistan.""AFGHANISTAN WAR
Trump will also have to decide whether to maintain the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan or change the scope of the mission, 15 years after a U.S.-led campaign toppled the hardline Islamist Taliban government.    The United States has spent some $115 billion in aid for Afghanistan since 2002, but the country is still caught in conflict, with a third of the country out of government control and thousands of Afghan civilians, soldiers and police dying every year.Afghan officials have voiced concern that the conflict is being forgotten in Washington, and warned privately that the West will pay a huge price if that continues.    ""The people of Afghanistan are tired of war. We want (Trump) to invest heavily in bringing peace to war-torn Afghanistan and stabilize our region,"" said Umer Daudzai, former Afghan minister of interior.Obama's original aim of pulling out of Afghanistan entirely has been put on hold in the face of mounting gains by Taliban militants, with U.S. air power and special forces still regularly involved in combat.    As recently as last week, two U.S. Green Berets were killed near the northern city of Kunduz.Although Afghan security forces have been fighting largely alone since the end of the main NATO-led combat mission in 2014, their performance has been patchy and they continue to rely heavily on U.S. air power.The Taliban on Wednesday urged Trump to withdraw all U.S. troops.""They should not cause damage to their economy and their military in this failed war,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said of the American government in a statement.

By Ginger Gibson and Grant Smith
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Donald Trump pulled off one of the biggest upsets in American political history when he toppled Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday - and he did it using far less cash than his rival.    Relying heavily on an unorthodox mix of social media, unfiltered rhetoric, and a knack for winning free TV time, the New York real estate businessman likely paid less than $5 per vote during his insurgent White House bid, about half what Clinton paid, according to a Reuters analysis of campaign finance records and voting data. Those figures assume the candidates spent all the funds they raised.    Trump's cost-effective win has upended prevailing concepts about the influence of money in American politics and raised the question of whether a lean, media-savvy campaign can become the new model for winning office in the United States.    Political strategists and academics tend to agree, however, that Trump's performance would be tough to repeat. A household name for his luxury brand resorts, reality TV stardom, and ability to surround himself with non-stop controversy, Trump held advantages that many political candidates lack.    ""I think this is a case where Trump had unique characteristics as a candidate that allowed him to pursue a different type of strategy,"" said Tony Corrado, a professor of government at Colby College in Maine.     In total, Trump raised at least $270 million since launching his campaign in June 2015, a little more than a third of the money that Obama's re-election campaign spent in 2012, according to the most recent filings with the Federal Elections Commission. With vote counting wrapping up in the early hours of Wednesday, Trump had won some 59 million votes nationwide in the general election. That amounts to less than $5 per vote for the $270 million he spent.    
According to data analytics firm mediaQuant, Trump garnered about $5 billion worth of free media coverage during the election campaign, more than twice the amount earned by Clinton, a lifelong politician who served as secretary of state, senator, and first lady at different times in her career.    mediaQuant adds up all the unpaid coverage the candidates earn in newspapers, magazines and social media and then compares the sum to what a comparable amount of coverage, with the same kind of reach, would have cost in advertising.     Trump has also frequently dominated news cycles with provocative rhetoric that breaks taboos, including unabashed insults targeting women he dislikes over Twitter, or unusual policy proscriptions like his call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country to prevent domestic attacks, or to force Mexico to pay for a multi-billion dollar border wall to keep out immigrants.    

    BIG DONORS
    Trump made his self-funding a selling point early in his campaign as he fended off 16 Republican rivals for the party nomination, arguing that by eschewing big donors he was not beholden to special interests.     But once he secured the nomination, Trump changed course and began fundraising in earnest, replicating the small dollar fundraising juggernaut of another insurgent candidate, Democrat Bernie Sanders, along the way.        Clinton raised at least $521 million, according to filings.     
    The former secretary of state stuck to the more traditional campaigning model of launching expensive television ads and funding hundreds of staffers who fanned across the country to work to increase voter turnout on Election Day.     She spent more than $237 million on television ads and more than $42 million on hundreds of staffers.    She also benefited from spending by the Super PACs supporting her candidacy, which are allowed to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money but cannot coordinate directly with the campaign. More than a dozen people, including hedge fund magnate Donald Sussman and global financier George Soros, wrote multi-million checks to Priorities USA, the primary PAC supporting her campaign, according to filings.    Michael Traugott, a political science professor at the University of Michigan, said the traditional U.S. model for picking presidents might seem odd to people in other nations, where campaigns are shorter and require less cash.    ""The system is clearly broken,"" Traugott said. (Additional reporting by Michelle Conlin; Editing by Richard Valdmanis, Alistair Bell and Grant McCool)"
