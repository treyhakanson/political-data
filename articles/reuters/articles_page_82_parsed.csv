By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Congress on Wednesday overwhelmingly rejected President Barack Obama's veto of legislation allowing relatives of the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia, the first veto override of his presidency, just four months before it ends.The House of Representatives voted 348-77 against the veto, hours after the Senate rejected it 97-1, meaning the ""Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act"" will become law.The vote was a blow to Obama as well as to Saudi Arabia, one of the United States' longest-standing allies in the Arab world, and some lawmakers who supported the override already plan to revisit the issue.Obama said he thought the Congress had made a mistake, reiterating his belief that the legislation set a dangerous precedent and indicating that he thought political considerations were behind the vote.""If you're perceived as voting against 9/11 families right before an election, not surprisingly, that's a hard vote for people to take. But it would have been the right thing to do,"" he said on CNN.Obama's 11 previous vetoes were all sustained. But this time almost all his strongest Democratic supporters in Congress joined Republicans to oppose him in one of their last actions before leaving Washington to campaign for the Nov. 8 election.""Overriding a presidential veto is something we don't take lightly, but it was important in this case that the families of the victims of 9/11 be allowed to pursue justice, even if that pursuit causes some diplomatic discomforts,"" Senator Charles Schumer, a top Senate Democrat, said in a statement.Schumer represents New York, site of the World Trade Center and home to many of the nearly 3,000 people killed in the 2001 attacks, survivors and families of victims.The law, known as JASTA, passed the House and Senate without objections earlier this year.Support was fueled by impatience in Congress with Saudi Arabia over its human rights record, promotion of a severe form of Islam tied to militancy and failure to do more to ease the international refugee crisis.
The law grants an exception to the legal principle of sovereign immunity in cases of terrorism on U.S. soil, clearing the way for lawsuits seeking damages from the Saudi government.Riyadh has denied longstanding suspicions that it backed the hijackers who attacked the United States in 2001. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals.Family members had tied their last push for the bill to the 15th anniversary of the attacks this month, demonstrating outside the White House and Capitol. On Wednesday, two fire trucks displayed a giant U.S. flag outside the Senate.""We rejoice in this triumph and look forward to our day in court and a time when we may finally get more answers regarding who was truly behind the attacks,"" Terry Strada, whose husband died in the attacks, said in a statement.
RISK TO TROOPS?
Obama argued that JASTA could expose U.S. companies, troops and officials to lawsuits if other countries passed reciprocal legislation, and may anger important allies.He called Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and wrote a letter to him explaining that he strongly believed enacting JASTA into law would be detrimental to U.S. interests. Reid became the only senator to side with Obama.Some lawmakers said the White House, which has a history of poor relations with Congress, had waited too long to fight the bill.The Sept. 11 families have received more than $7 billion, but bill backers said their intention was to allow lawsuits to punish any government that backs terrorism on U.S. soil.
""This bill was carefully negotiated over more than six years,"" Representative Jerrold Nadler, another New York Democrat, told the House.The issue, however, may not be finished. At least 28 senators signed a letter to JASTA's sponsors, Schumer and Republican Senator John Cornyn, asking that they work with them to mitigate any potential unintended national security and foreign policy consequences.The Saudi government financed an extensive lobbying campaign against the legislation.U.S. corporations including General Electric Co and Dow Chemical Co also opposed it, as did the European Union and other U.S. allies.Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, opposed the bill and CIA Director John Brennan said JASTA had ""grave implications"" for national security.Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton's vice presidential running mate, and Bernie Sanders, an independent and former Democratic White House contender, did not vote.Override opponents in the House included Representative Mac Thornberry, Republican chairman of the Armed Services committee, and Adam Smith, its ranking Democrat, citing concern about U.S. forces overseas.

CHICAGO U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said on Thursday that Republican opponent Donald Trump may have violated U.S. law, following a news report that one of his companies attempted to do business in Cuba.Newsweek said on Thursday that a hotel and casino company controlled by Trump secretly conducted business with Cuba that was illegal under U.S. sanctions in force during Fidel Castro's presidency of the Communist-ruled island.(See the Newsweek article: bit.ly/2dmKH3e) ""Today we learned about his efforts to do business in Cuba which appear to violate U.S. law, certainly flout American foreign policy, and he has consistently misled people in responding to questions about whether he was attempting to do business in Cuba,"" Clinton told reporters on her campaign plane.Clinton and Trump are in a close race ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election.
The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.Newsweek, citing interviews with former Trump executives, internal company records and court filings, said the Trump company spent at least $68,000 for a 1998 trip to Cuba at a time when any corporate expenditure in the Caribbean country was prohibited without U.S. government approval.
The Trump company did not spend the money directly, but funneled the cash for the Cuba trip through an American consulting firm, Newsweek said.Newsweek cited a former Trump executive as saying the goal of the Cuba trip was to give Trump's company a foothold should Washington loosen or lift the restrictions under the U.S. trade embargo.
The former executive said Trump had participated in discussions about the Cuba trip and knew it had taken place, according to Newsweek.""The efforts that Trump is making to get into the Cuba market, putting his business interests ahead of the laws of the United States ... shows that he puts his personal and business interests ahead of the laws and the values and the policies of the United States of America,"" Clinton said.

By Terry Wade
| HOUSTON

HOUSTON Taco trucks in Houston have begun doubling as voter registration sites as Latinos in Texas flex their political muscle before the Nov. 8 presidential election in a state that has long symbolized Mexican immigration to the United States.Riffing on widely ridiculed comments by Marco Gutierrez, a supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, that without action on immigration reform, ""you're going to have taco trucks on every corner,"" the non-partisan civic group Mi Familia Vota is driving the effort to reach first-time voters.""We Latinos have been the group with the most growth in Texas, but this hasn't translated into the political sphere,"" said Houston coordinator Carlos Zamora. ""We want to build political capital.""Although Texas is a Republican stronghold, demographics in the Lone Star State are seen shifting in favor of Democrats with the steady increase in Hispanic voters, who have historically favored the party. In the 2012 election, Latinos nationally voted for Democratic President Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney by 71 percent to 27 percent, according to exit polls.The Pew Research Center estimated this year that 39 percent of Texans were Hispanic and that about 4.8 million Latinos were eligible to vote in the state.
Historically, there has been a voter registration gap. In 2012, about 2.6 million Latinos were registered to vote in Texas, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.In 2012, Romney beat Obama in Texas by about 16 points. In this year's campaign, Trump, whose hardline approach to illegal immigration has alarmed many Hispanics, leads Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state by about 8 points, according to fivethirtyeight.com's average of polls.
Mi Familia Vota did not say how many people it hoped to register in Texas. It said that in the first few days of the campaign, it often had to restock registration brochures at the trucks.At Tacos Tierra Caliente, one of eight taco trucks participating in the registration drive in Houston, posters urging customers to vote hung next to the menu of meat stuffings painted on the side of the truck advertising barbacoa, lengua and pollo.At the metal counter where they pay, customers can fill out  voter registration cards that require no postage when mailed. The group plans to expand its campaign to other taco trucks across the country's fourth most populous city.

By Mica Rosenberg
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Families of Sept. 11 victims and others who may seek to sue foreign governments accused of supporting terrorism in the United States still face significant legal hurdles, despite a boost from passage of a law allowing such cases to proceed. The new Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, grants an exception to the legal principle of sovereign immunity in cases of terrorism on U.S. soil. Passage of the law over a presidential veto could allow relatives and survivors of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to move forward with a case they filed more than a decade ago against Saudi Arabia in New York federal court.Still, it will be hard to prove a foreign nation is responsible for acts of terrorism, said attorneys and professors with expertise in international law, who expected drawn-out legal wrangling.""We may find that at the end of the day, after years of litigation, that the link is not sufficiently established even for Saudi Arabia,"" said Curtis Bradley, a law professor at Duke University. The law says plaintiffs must show the foreign state ""knowingly or recklessly provided material support or resources"" to designated terrorist groups, not that the countries were simply negligent or looked the other way. Congress on Wednesday overwhelming voted to pass the law, overturning President Barack Obama's veto. Before the law, American victims of terrorist acts could only sue countries designated by the U.S. State Department as state-sponsors of terrorism, currently Iran, Syria and Sudan.Now, any country can be sued if there are allegations of support for known terrorists that carry out attacks on U.S. soil. Existing tort law requires plaintiffs to prove that support played a ""substantial factor"" in the victims' injuries, a high bar, said Jimmy Gurule an expert in international criminal law at the University of Notre Dame.   This could be challenging in the Sept. 11 case since an independent commission on the 2001 attacks did not find sufficient evidence of Saudi involvement. Al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attacks and most of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals. 
""We have a high degree of confidence we can meet that burden. The Saudis think we can't,"" said Jack Quinn, co-counsel for more than 2,000 family members of Sept. 11 victims. The families sued Saudi Arabia in 2003, seeking to hold the country responsible. The proceedings have been stalled on the question of Saudi Arabia's immunityQuinn said the plaintiffs will now ask the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider the issue in light of the new law. If the court says the case can move forward, both sides will use discovery to seek documents and take depositions of witnesses and experts. ""We will next attempt to complete the development of evidence and find out what the truth is and on the basis of that, let the chips fall as they may,"" said Quinn.  
LONG BATTLE AHEAD
But even under the new law, the White House can still request a court to halt this and other potential lawsuits.The law allows a court to put a proceeding against a foreign state on hold if the United States says it ""is engaged in good faith discussions"" with the country to resolve the claims. The stay provision and other changes were added to address concerns raised by the White House, Saudi Arabia and companies like General Electric and Dow Chemical Co.
Obama is likely to request such a stay, said Bradley.Stephen Vladeck of the University of Texas School of Law, said this revision and others injected uncertainty into the law and could result in litigation aimed at clarifying the bill's language.""The next step in this is either a whole bunch of lawsuits being placed on indefinite hold or a whole bunch of litigation to figure out the meaning of all these obstacles that Congress snuck back into the bill at the last minute,"" said Vladeck.Even with the revisions, detractors of the new law worried that it could inspire other countries to retaliate by enacting their own statutes that could drag the United States or U.S. companies into court. Some U.S. lawmakers said Congress may revisit the law to narrow it further. Ultimately, though, if the victims of terrorist acts win a court  judgment against a foreign government, other cases have shown that collecting damages can be a slog.A Reuters analysis last year found that in the 10 years following the Sept. 11 attacks, the number of lawsuits filed under the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act and similar laws more than tripled compared to the decade before with plaintiffs winning billions of dollars worth of judgments in U.S. courts. But judgments awarded against organizations or governments are often unenforceable and even when there are assets that can be claimed in the United States, their value often falls short of the award.

By Mark Hosenball
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. government will open the doors next week to a new agency, with stronger data protections, meant to shorten by many weeks the time it takes to vet government workers seeking ""secret"" and ""top secret"" security clearances.The National Background Investigations Bureau will be headed by Charles Phalen, who has worked as a security executive at the CIA, the FBI and defense contractor Northrop Grumman, officials said on Thursday on a conference call with reporters.The bureau will replace an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) clearance system that was hit by hackers who stole potentially sensitive personal data on as many as 22 million people, including government employees and job applicants.Phalen and OPM Director Beth Cobert said a top priority for the bureau will be shortening delays in the clearance process, which can hold up the hiring of government employees for months.
Cobert said that OPM figures show on average the time required to complete an investigation for a ""secret"" level security clearance is now 120 days; for a ""top secret clearance, it is 170 days on average.""These timelines are well too long,"" Phelan acknowledged.
Cobert said the new agency's goal would be to reduce the time for completing a ""secret"" clearance to 40 days and to cut the time for a ""top secret"" investigation to 80 days.Officials said that individual government agencies, rather than the new central investigations bureau, would be responsible for social media checks of security clearance applicants. 
Officials said that the new bureau would still depend on outside contractors, especially for hiring field investigators. The new agency will employ 2,500 government workers and 6,000 contract employees, officials said. (Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Sandra Maler)"	[]	[]

The Kansas Secretary of State and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have reached a temporary agreement over the state's voter registration laws, keeping Kansas' chief elections officer from a contempt of court hearing, according to court documents filed on Thursday.The deal between Secretary of State Kris Kobach and the ACLU comes six weeks before the U.S. presidential election.The two sides have been at odds over a Kansas law requiring people to prove American citizenship if they want to register to vote while applying for a driver's license. Critics say this requirement disenfranchises voters, especially minorities.The deal will allow people who registered at motor vehicle offices or with a federal form without providing citizenship documents to vote in the Nov. 8 election with a standard ballot, rather than be forced to use a provisional one, the ACLU and Kobach said in a status report filed on Thursday.Kobach will also clarify his office's website to help voters find information more easily, according to the report filed to U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson. Robinson had ordered Kobach, a Republican, to explain by Thursday why he should not be held in contempt for failing to obey a federal order issued in May. 
That order required him to register people who applied to vote at motor vehicle offices or with a federal form without proof of citizenship.Robinson canceled the contempt hearing scheduled for Friday, according to her own court filing, citing the ACLU and Kobach's agreement. 
""Our case is ongoing, but this interim agreement is a critical victory for Kansans who want to vote in the November election. It is a shame that voters had to fight so hard to get Kris Kobach to do his job,"" ACLU attorney Orion Danjuma said in a statement.Kobach said he was pleased an agreement had been reached, but criticized the ACLU. ""The ACLU's argument was weak at best. However, at this point the preparations for the November 8, 2016, general election must proceed with rules established to ensure the efficient administration of the election,"" he said in a statement. 
Kansas' law, among the strictest voter identification statutes in the country, is defended by Republicans who say the rules are meant to prevent voter fraud. On Tuesday, a Kansas state judge issued a separate ruling extending voting rights through the Nov. 8 election of about 17,500 people who registered to vote at motor vehicle offices.

By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK A majority of Americans say Democrat Hillary Clinton won Monday night's presidential debate, but her performance doesn't appear to have immediately boosted her support among likely voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll released on Wednesday.The online poll, which gathered responses from more than 2,000 people on Tuesday, found 56 percent of American adults felt that Clinton did a better job than Trump in the first of their three televised debates, compared with 26 percent who felt that Trump did better.Of those who thought Clinton emerged the victor, 85 percent were Democrats and 22 percent were Republicans.


 
U.S. presidential debates have historically been seen as a crucial test of candidates' poise and policies. Monday's was watched by a record 84 million viewers and was billed as a rare prime-time opportunity for two unpopular candidates to convince millions of undecided voters to back them.Afterward, both candidates claimed victory.""""Every single online poll had me winning,"" Trump said at a campaign stop in Council Bluffs, Iowa on Wednesday. ""You sit back and you hear how well she did in the debate. I don't think she did well at all.""Clinton campaign spokesman Jesse Ferguson said the Democrat clearly won the debate as Trump ""was unprepared, became unhinged and was incoherent throughout.""
Among those who are expected to take part in the Nov. 8 general election, 34 percent said they felt that the debate changed their view of Clinton in a positive way, compared with 19 percent who said the same of Trump. DELAYED REACTION

Some 31 percent of likely voters said the debate improved Clinton's chances of winning the White House, while 16 percent said the debate benefited Trump.Even so, Clinton's performance seemed to have little impact on her support among America's likely voters. The poll showed 42 percent supported Clinton while 38 percent supported Trump. Over the past few weeks Clinton has maintained a lead of between 4 and 6 points over Trump.Narrowing the focus to likely voters who watched the debate, Clinton led Trump 44 percent to 39 percent.One possible reason for the lack of movement in her support is that it usually takes several days to measure the full impact of a single event, like a debate, said Donald Green, a political scientist at Columbia University.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted every day in English in all 50 states. Monday's sample of 2,036 American adults included 1,336 people who were considered to be likely voters from their voting record, registration status and stated intention to vote in the election. Among those likely voters, 1,026 said they watched some portion of the debate on live TV, online or in media clips that were circulated after the debate.The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire sample and the sample of likely voters. It has a credibility interval of 4 percentage points for the likely voters who watched the debate.National opinion polls have differed this year in how they measure support for Clinton and Trump. Some polls, like Reuters/Ipsos, try to include only likely voters, while others include all registered voters. The Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll gathers responses every day and reports results twice a week, so it often detects trends in sentiment before most other polls.Polling aggregators, which calculate averages of major polls, have shown that Clinton's lead over Trump has been shrinking this month to about 2 percentage points.

By Amanda Becker
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democratic Party progressives intent on reining in Wall Street are pushing Hillary Clinton to choose people to head the Treasury, SEC and other agencies who will crack down on big banks if she wins the White House on Nov. 8.""Do they have a proven track record of challenging corporate power?"" asked Adam Green of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a grassroots group aligned with U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the party's liberal firebrand.In meetings with Clinton's team, progressive groups are urging that she break sharply with the centrist, pro-business bent of some of the economic leaders who served her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and President Barack Obama.Big U.S. banks are voicing concern about both Clinton and Donald Trump, her Republican rival who has accused corporate America of buying influence in Washington.RASKIN A FAVORITE
Among Democratic progressives, a favorite for Treasury secretary is Sarah Bloom Raskin, now deputy Treasury secretary and a backer of strict enforcement of the Volcker Rule that prohibits banks from making some types of speculative investments.""I view proprietary trading as an activity of low or no real economic value that should not be part of any banking model that has an implicit government backstop,"" Raskin, then a Federal Reserve governor, said in a 2012 speech.Democratic activists, who believe Obama did not go far enough at the height of the 2007-2009 financial crisis to punish bankers and tighten regulation, want to make sure Clinton keeps her campaign promises to defend the 2010 Dodd-Frank reforms and build on them to curb Wall Street's excesses.
Progressive priorities include ensuring the U.S. Justice Department pursues criminal cases against bankers, not just institutions.SANDBERG, BRAINARD
Some Democratic activists are wary of two potential  Treasury candidates - Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, and Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard - because of links to the Bill Clinton and Obama administrations.Sandberg was chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Larry Summers in Bill Clinton's administration and Brainard was a top lieutenant to Timothy Geithner, Obama's first Treasury secretary.     
Locked in a tight race with Trump, Clinton has said little about any future appointments. Her spokesman, Brian Fallon, said any speculation about personnel is ""entirely premature"" as Clinton is focusing on winning the election.She has no obligation to heed the advice of progressives like Warren or Bernie Sanders, who challenged Clinton for the Democratic nomination. But Clinton risks a damaging intraparty rift early in her White House tenure if she ignores them.Kara Stein, a commissioner on the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and co-author of a book warning of the dangers posed by big financial institutions, are progressive favorites for SEC chair.Progressives also favor Gary Gensler, an adviser to Hillary Clinton, for a senior administration role because of his reputation as a tough regulator when he headed the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the Obama administration.
'BROAD FEELING OF REGRET'
Jeff Hauser, director of the Revolving Door Project at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, said progressives have a ""broad feeling of regret"" that they did not exert more pressure on Obama to name officials committed to bold financial regulatory reforms.""It wasn't so much that progressives lost, it's that they didn't understand the stakes at the time and didn't get into the game until it was too late,"" Hauser said.Warren, who would have a big microphone in any potential fight over U.S. Senate confirmation of nominees, in a speech last week at the Center for American Progress, warned Clinton against choosing people who work at big investment banks.""When we talk about personnel, we don't mean advisers who just pay lip service to Hillary's bold agenda, coupled with a sigh, a knowing glance, and a twiddling of thumbs until it's time for the next swing through the revolving door, serving government then going back to the very same industries they regulate,"" she said.The New York-based Roosevelt Institute think tank is seeking lesser-known candidates, some outside Washington, for at least 120 administration jobs. Their potential candidates include state attorneys general who have taken on for-profit colleges and handled large mortgage settlements.
