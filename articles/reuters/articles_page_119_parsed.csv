WASHINGTON Marco Rubio, who dropped out of the Republican presidential race earlier this year, was chosen on Tuesday as the Republican Party nominee for a second U.S. Senate term from Florida, according to the Associated Press.Rubio was projected to win the party nominating contest in Florida over novice politician Carlos Beruff, a wealthy homebuilder. Rubio could face Democratic U.S. Representative Patrick Murphy, who was expected to win his party's nominating contest, in the Nov. 8 election.

WASHINGTON The successful conclusion of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade talks remains the top legislative item for the United States, a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama said on Tuesday.White House National Security Council adviser Christina Segal-Knowles told a news conference ahead of the Sept. 4-5 G20 summit in China that talks on a trade pact with Europe were still in progress, despite comments from France and Germany that they were in doubt.The Asian talks are stalled in Congress and both Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump have said they would not approve the deal in its current form, if elected president in November.
Segal-Knowles said corporate tax issues would be on the G20's agenda in China, although when asked whether the European Union's tax ruling on Apple Inc's deal with Ireland would be discussed, she did not directly address the issue facing the company.

By Dustin Volz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democrats in Congress, including party Senate leader Harry Reid, asked the FBI to investigate concerns that the Russian government may be attempting to undermine the U.S. presidential election through cyber attacks that could include tampering with voting results.""The prospect of a hostile government actively seeking to undermine our free and fair elections represents one of the gravest threats to our democracy since the Cold War,"" Reid said in a letter to FBI Director James Comey.Reid's letter, dated Saturday, was first obtained by The New York Times and shared on its website on Monday.It was followed on Tuesday by a letter from four Democrats asking Comey to assess whether campaign officials working for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump may be colluding with Russian interests to carry out recent hacks against the Democratic National Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in order to ""interfere with the U.S. presidential election.""
That letter was signed by Representatives Elijah Cummings, John Conyers, Elliot Engel and Bennie Thompson, each of whom serves as the top Democrat on a different congressional committee. Republicans control both the House of Representatives and the Senate.Comey, speaking at a cyber security conference on Tuesday, declined to give details about what the Federal Bureau of Investigation was probing in connection with the political hacking but indicated the agency was closely watching what foreign countries are doing.""We take very seriously any effort by any actor, ... especially nation states, that moves beyond the collection of information ... and offers the prospect of an effort to influence the conduct of affairs in our country, whether that is an election or something else,"" he said.
The two letters follow a spate of hacking attacks targeting U.S. political databases, including some that officials and cyber security experts have blamed on hackers working for the Russian government. Kremlin officials have denied that.The FBI examined breaches in voter registration databases in Illinois and Arizona but did not specify who might have been behind it.
Reid said that the threat of Russian government tampering in the election was ""more extensive than widely known and may include the intent to falsify official election results.""He also voiced concerns about possible Russian government efforts to manipulate Trump's campaign ahead of the Nov. 8 election, and to use it as a vehicle to advance the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

A former Virginia politician who was jailed over a sex scandal involving a teenage girl leads a crowded field running for mayor of the state's capital city, a poll showed on Tuesday. Joe Morrissey, 58, holds a commanding lead in the Richmond mayor's race with 28 percent of the vote city-wide, according to the Christopher Newport University poll. The poll showed him about 12 points ahead of the nearest of his seven competitors.Morrissey pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor in December 2014 for his relationship with a receptionist who began working in his office when she was 17. He is now married to the woman and they have two children.Morrissey, who was first elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 2007, was sentenced to six months in jail and resigned from office. He switched from Democrat to run as an independent in the special election to fill his seat.
During a three-month stay in an area jail, Morrissey commuted to the state legislature on work release and also ran his re-election campaign.Morrissey stunned political pundits when he won in January 2015 while serving his jail sentence. He gave up his most recent bid to serve in the state Senate last September, citing health problems.    
The poll was based on 600 live interviews with registered voters Aug. 18 through- 24 and has a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points.
Morrissey also had his license to practice law revoked by the Virginia State Bar Disciplinary Board in 2003.  (Reporting by Curtis Skinner in San Francisco; Editing by Dan Grebler)"	['Richmond']	[]

By Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley opened the door to holding a hearing on President Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland if a majority of senators wish to do so after the Nov. 8 election, in comments posted online Tuesday.Grassley, an Iowa Republican, vowed months ago that the Senate Judiciary Committee he chairs would not act this year to consider Garland's nomination, saying the Republican-majority Senate should not act on a Court nominee until after the new president takes office early next year.But in a town hall meeting Monday in Cherokee, Iowa, Grassley indicated he could be persuaded by a large number of senators to take action in a ""lame duck"" session between the Nov. 8 election and the inauguration of the new president in January.""If we have the election, and there was a majority of the Senate changed their mind about doing it in the lame duck, as opposed to January 20,  I don't feel that I could stand in the way of that. But I don't think I can promote that idea,"" he said in a video of his remarks posted online by the American Bridge 21st Century website, which says it is committed to ""holding Republicans accountable.""
Grassley made a similar point at the Sioux City Iowa Rotary Club, Iowa's Globe Gazette reported.Garland, a federal appeals court judge, was nominated by Obama, a Democrat, on March 16 to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.
Republicans insist that the next president should fill the vacancy, hoping a Republican will win the White House and choose a conservative rather than the centrist Garland. But such an outcome is not assured, with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton currently leading Republican candidate Donald Trump in public opinion polls.A spokeswoman for Grassley, Beth Levine, denied he was shifting his position. She said that in Sioux City Grassley reiterated his stance ""that a Supreme Court nominee wouldn't be considered until after the next president is sworn in so the American people have an opportunity to weigh in on this important issue.""
Senate Republican leaders have vowed not to hold confirmation hearings or an up-or-down vote on any Supreme Court nominee put forward by Obama. ""The Leader has been clear: the next president will make this nomination,"" Don Stewart, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said in an email Tuesday.

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama shortened the prison sentences of 111 convicts serving time for drug-related offenses in his second round of clemency grants this month, the White House said on Tuesday.Obama has now granted a total of 673 commutations during his presidency, more than the number granted by the 10 previous presidents combined, as he seeks to reform the criminal justice system, it said. For some of the convicts, the commutations mean they will serve only half of their original prison sentences. For instance, Sly Stallone Aikens of South Carolina, serving a sentence of 360 months for using and carrying a gun during a drug trafficking crime, will now serve only 180 months.More than one-third of the 673 convicts had been serving life sentences.    
Obama has made reducing the number of people serving long sentences for nonviolent drug offenses a priority. It is one of the rare issues where the president gets support from Republican lawmakers.
He launched the clemency program in 2014, inviting thousands of drug offenders and others to seek early release. It was the most ambitious such program in 40 years, but it has struggled under a flood of thousands of unprocessed cases.The White House counsel, Neil Eggleston, said he expects Obama will continue to grant commutations through the end of his presidency, which ends on Jan. 20. But only legislation passed by Congress can ""achieve the broader reforms needed to ensure our federal sentencing system operates more fairly and effectively,"" Eggleston said.

By Sophie Louet and Philip Blenkinsop
| PARIS/BRUSSELS

PARIS/BRUSSELS France cast serious doubt on Tuesday on the prospects of an EU free trade deal with the United States, adding to opposition within Germany and growing scepticism among Americans.Washington and Brussels are officially committed to sealing the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) before U.S. President Barack Obama leaves office in January, but their chances of doing so are being eroded by approaching elections on both sides of the Atlantic and Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union.""Everything is moving. In this situation it's just not going to happen,"" said Peter van Ham, senior research fellow at Dutch think tank Clingendael and author of a paper on Tuesday called ""TTIP is dead, long live transatlantic trade"".French Trade Minister Matthias Fekl said he would request a halt to TTIP talks at next month's EU trade ministers' meeting in Bratislava after German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel declared at the weekend that talks were ""de facto dead"".Observers say both are responding to public mistrust of a deal that critics say would lower environmental and food standards and allow foreign multinationals to challenge government policies. Stop TTIP campaigns have been particularly vocal in Germany and Austria, which supporters of TTIP say are among the countries most likely to benefit from increased U.S. trade.In the United States, Obama has promoted the accord, saying it would fuel growth. But the public mood is turning increasingly negative, with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump making attacks on international trade deals a cornerstone of his campaign, saying they have cost U.S. jobs. His opponent, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, has also stepped back from her previous support for free trade when she was U.S. Secretary of State, and has questioned whether trade deals hold down U.S. wages.   FRENCH, GERMAN ELECTIONS LOOM 
German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, of Gabriel's Social Democratic Party (SPD), urged diplomats and business chiefs on Tuesday to counter anti-globalization sentiments that are fuelling opposition to free trade deals.
Ahead of elections in France and Germany next year, politicians are keenly aware that TTIP is not a vote winner. The Bertelsmann Foundation poll showed only 17 percent of Germans saw TTIP as a good thing in April, down from 55 percent two years earlier.""There may be an economic rationale, but everyone is scrapping for votes and you lose votes if you support TTIP,"" Van Ham said, adding that any credit from potential free trade gains  would be two to three years away.Supporters say TTIP could boost each economy by $100 billion, creating jobs at a time of economic uncertainty as growth and consumption slow in China and emerging markets. EU leaders backed TTIP talks at a summit in June.Speaking to reporters in Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest admitted ""significant aspects"" of the deal were unresolved, but said U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman would travel to Europe in an effort to push the talks forward.
""I anticipate that when he travels to Europe in mid-September that they'll be engaged in substantive discussions and hopefully will be able to make some additional progress,"" Earnest said.Three years of negotiations have failed to resolve multiple differences, however, including over public procurement and rules to protect foods from particular regions, such as Parma ham, which the EU wants, and greater access to services and for its agricultural products, as demanded by the United States.""Practically there's no real change. It's been stuck for the better part of two years,"" said Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of Brussels-based think tank ECIPE.BREXIT QUESTION 
EU trade chief Cecelia Malmstrom told journalists  negotiations had not failed and that many EU countries had said they still backed TTIP.
They included Italy, whose trade and industry minister said it was essential for Italian exporters that the negotiations bore fruit.Germany's Gabriel is the chairman of the SPD who share power with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives. Merkel backs the talks and her spokesman insisted on Monday that they should continue.  Malmstrom added that it made no sense to suspend talks in September because the two sides could still make advances in regulatory cooperation, agreeing standards that are important to industries such as the auto sector, and that could be picked up by Obama's successor even if a deal was not sealed this year.""The more work we have done, the easier it is to resume,"" she said before a planned video conference with Froman. Froman has said Britain's EU exit will affect TTIP because Britain consumes about a quarter of U.S. exports to the bloc.Trade analysts say that Washington may be preparing for the end of trade talks, which typically conclude with each side holding the other responsible for failure. President Francois Hollande told ambassadors on Tuesday that talks were ""bogged down"" and ""unbalanced"" and it was an illusion to imagine that a deal could be sealed during Obama's term.""Very soon you end in a blame game,"" said Lee-Makiyama. ""But trade negotiations never really die. They just go into a stock-taking phase.""

By Timothy Aeppel
| MUNCIE, Indiana

MUNCIE, Indiana One night a month, retired auto workers shuffle into a former elementary school classroom here to discuss their legal fight against the company that cancelled their health care benefits seven years ago.But the conversation often turns quickly to presidential politics.""It can get pretty heated,"" says Gerald Poor, the group's 77-year-old president, of their political discussions. ""I call it to order if it gets out of hand.""Their anger is understandable. The group is a remnant of a once-powerful United Auto Workers union local, which at its peak in the 1960s represented over 5,000 workers who made transmissions in Muncie for BorgWarner Inc, the global auto parts maker. An American flag drapes the wall at one end of the room, portraits of former labor bosses line the other, salvaged from a union hall that had its own baseball field.For this group of mostly white, working-class men, the last two decades have brought much loss. In this election - with the victory of the populist Donald Trump as the Republican Party nominee and the strong run by the populist Bernie Sanders for the Democratic Party crown - many say they feel they're finally being heard again.


Gerald Poor stands in front of the now shuttered BorgWarner factory, where he worked for over 40 years, in Muncie, Indiana, U.S., August 13, 2016. REUTERS/Chris Bergin
Working-class white men were once a force to be reckoned with in American politics. Many here speak wistfully of how John F. Kennedy stopped at BorgWarner to talk to workers when he campaigned in 1960. For these men, this year's election is a rare taste of the clout they once took for granted.In the primary, Trump received the most votes of any candidate in either party in Delaware County, which encompasses Muncie. Just over 52 percent of Republican voters went for Trump. Democrats picked Sanders over Hillary Clinton by an even wider margin.""Candidates in the past made a lot of promises to the working class in this country and failed to follow through with it,"" says 66-year-old Bruce Reynolds, who followed his father and grandfather into a career at BorgWarner.Gazing through the rusted chain link fence that encircles the sprawling, abandoned factory, where he notes with precision that he worked for ""32 and a half years,"" he says he's still skeptical of both side's promises. THE WHITE SLIDE
Neither Trump nor Clinton was his first choice. Reynolds and his wife voted for Sanders in the primary, he says. Among other things, they couldn't support Clinton: She's the wife of former President Bill Clinton, who signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which many here blame for Muncie's economic decline. They were uneasy with the often fiery rhetoric of Trump, the other side's top candidate.Yet both plan to vote for Trump in November, and Reynolds says they've grown comfortable with the choice.""I know, it sounds like we're confused,"" he says. But they're not.Like many Trump supporters, he glides over the unappealing aspects of the candidate's message to lock onto those that he likes. For Reynolds, it's the hope of bringing back jobs for his children, some of whom still struggle to find decent work.Trump's gloomy world view is often dismissed as hyperbole, such as when he described crime and collapsed economies in America's cities at the Republican National Convention. But for someone in Muncie, that's not far off reality.

An analysis by Reuters found Delaware County is an extreme example of the declining fortunes of America's white working-class men.In 2000, white men with less than a college degree accounted for about three-quarters of all white men living in the county. By 2014, their proportion had dropped by about 5 percentage points, according to the US Census Bureau. But while this group's share of the population held relatively steady, the earnings of white men with full-time jobs had fallen dramatically.In 2000, 47 percent of white men working full time were in the bottom third of earners, with incomes of $50,000 or less, based on 2015 dollars. By 2014, 60 percent of them were in the bottom third.Meanwhile, the percentage of white men in full-time jobs making between $50,000 and $100,000 dropped from 43 percent to 32 percent. And the percentage in the ranks of earners above $100,000 slipped from 11 percent to 8 percent.In essence, white men in Muncie have slid down from every rung of the economic ladder. They have clustered at the bottom, poorer and more isolated than ever before, even as the overall U.S. economy has grown and globalized. 
MUNCIE AS ""MIDDLETOWN""
The same trend is visible in faded industrial pockets from New Jersey and upstate New York to Alabama and Kentucky.According to the data, in about 1,800 counties across the United States--nearly 60 percent of those where data is available--the share of white men in the lowest group of earners has grown over this period. The trend is particularly pronounced in the Rust Belt states of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana.Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at New York University's Stern School of Business, studies how people adopt their political beliefs. ""Trump is the first candidate to speak to--and speak for--working-class white men in a long time,"" Haidt says. That separates him from the last two Republican nominees. Mitt Romney, who lost in 2012, didn't do that, ""and John McCain didn't particularly reach out to that constituency"" in 2008.

As for Trump's extreme positions and outright falsehoods, Haidt notes, ""If your hero says things that are untrue, you'll cut him slack.""Muncie was once the epitome of America's muscular manufacturing economy. After natural gas was discovered here late in the 19th century, the city attracted dozens of energy-intensive glass manufacturers, most notably Ball Corp, which built sprawling factories that churned out millions of mason jars.The auto industry followed, and Muncie became a hub for transmission making. The term ""Muncie transmission"" is still used by hot rod enthusiasts when talking about gearboxes produced here by General Motors Corp in the 1960s. One particularly powerful version is the ""rock crusher,"" used in Corvettes and other muscle cars.BorgWarner, based in Auburn Hills, Michigan, has even deeper roots in Muncie than GM. Warner Gear was founded here in 1901 and merged with other businesses to create what became BorgWarner in the late 1920s. Many former workers here still call it Warner Gear.In the 1920s, a husband-and-wife team of sociologists picked the city to study the values in a typical American community. They called it ""Middletown,"" to conceal the identity of a place they felt was emblematic of the country as a whole. Muncie residents soon figured out it was all about them.The Center for Middletown Studies--at Ball State University--has continued the work, compiling oral histories and, in recent years, focused on the devastation of deindustrialization. James Connolly, a history professor who runs the center, says that more than anything else, Muncie's working-class white men feel a loss of power. When the big factories were humming, the unions were an unstoppable force--not just for getting good paychecks and lush benefits, but a voice in almost everything else. 
UNION POWER
To illustrate this power, he cites a locally famous episode from the 1960s, when waitresses at a big downtown hotel went on strike for higher wages.""A group of police got rough and tried to break up the pickets,"" says Connolly. A local union leader--who had nothing to do with the waitresses, other than knowing about them through community connections--called the then-mayor, who was visiting Washington, and ""ordered him home"" to intervene. The mayor returned and the police backed off.""The strikers weren't union members--but there was a system of connections that gave them a sense of control,"" says Connolly. With the decline of the unions, working-class people ""feel like they've been robbed of that voice.""

And yet unions, which were unable to prevent the factory closures that ravaged the city, are often viewed just as suspiciously here as most national politicians are. That tension is visible at the old school where the BorgWarner retirees meet.The Muncie Delaware County Senior Center was created to give retirees from the big factories--particularly men--a place to go for companionship and activities. One recent day, the room the BorgWarner retirees use was filled with seniors learning line dancing.""Some people don't like the photos"" of the union leaders, says Jim Shields, a janitor, motioning toward the 10 portraits that adorn the front of the room. They feel the images carry an implicitly political, pro-union message. So, there was a fuss the last time the building was used as a polling station, he said. ""We had complaints."" Now, when the BorgWarner retiree group isn't meeting, Shields carefully drapes a long bolt of fabric over the pictures to conceal them.Michael Hicks, a Ball State economist who studies manufacturing, says a mix of exasperation with unions and the political elite created the perfect opening for Trump. ""It's always easier to blame a larger force for your problems, whether that's Mexicans or greedy factory owners,"" he says. ""But these people aren't stupid. They know the jobs aren't coming back."" The bigger concern for many of them, he says, is what will happen to their children.The Reynolds family is a good example. Bruce Reynolds's oldest son, Bruce Jr, is a Baptist pastor and is supporting Trump, albeit reluctantly. ""I don't think any of them can fix it,"" Bruce Jr says of the fallout he sees from economic hardship in his congregation, from growing drug addiction to broken families. FROM FACTORY TO WAREHOUSE

Reynolds's second son, Robert, followed his father into BorgWarner after high school. That job didn't last. After just four years, he was laid off in 1994 during a wave of downsizing. He and his father say it was a trauma from which he never fully recovered.""I make $8 an hour less now than I made 21 years ago,"" says Robert, who enthusiastically backs Trump. After a series of low-paying jobs, including a stint at Wal-Mart and as a manager of a video store, he now works overnight shifts at a warehouse for $18 an hour. He likes the job, he says, although the company recently cut three paid holidays, including the Fourth of July.Robert concedes that he finds the Republican candidate's approach to foreign policy worrisome. ""You wonder if something will upset him and he'll declare war,"" he says. ""That would be awful."" He also doesn't like how race and immigration has become a theme in the campaign. ""This country was built on bring us your tired, your poor--I think we should honor what our forefathers built,"" he says.But he also doesn't believe Trump's message is racist. ""I think he's looking at all the illegal activity going on in the U.S. and how it affects the job market,"" he says. ""He's just not very tactful"" in how he expresses this. Meanwhile, Trump's promise to restore the economy is the draw.To be sure, Muncie has retained some of its smaller factories, and other jobs have come in, including a call center that tracks down delinquent student loans and a Caterpillar Inc locomotive factory that moved into an old plant. But none of these are unionized, and the wages and benefits aren't as high as the old places offered.One frustration for locals is that the statistical measures of the economy don't seem to reflect what they see around them. Muncie's jobless rate is 5.7 percent, less than one percentage point higher than the national rate of 4.9 percent or Indiana's 4.6 percent.But the impact of deindustrialization--including the exodus of over 10,000 factory jobs since 1970 in a city of only 70,000 people--is visible almost everywhere.

Most of the departing companies tore down their factories, leaving lots strewn with weeds and rubble. BorgWarner left a handful of structures--including a 1.2 million-square-foot sprawl of red brick and steel near the edge of town.The city, especially the once-thriving white working-class neighborhoods on the south side, is now dotted with over 2,000 abandoned houses. Some can't be occupied because they were contaminated by chemicals left behind by meth labs. PHOTOGRAPH FROM A HAPPIER TIME
Meanwhile, the FBI recently opened a probe of the city government, which appears to be focused on possible corruption in its blight clearing program and the sanitation district. The FBI wouldn't comment on the investigation, and Mayor Dennis Tyler said he can't talk about it. There have been no indictments in the case, and it's possible no charges will result.Mayor Tyler, a Democrat, notes the jobless rate stood just under 10 percent four years ago, when he took office, so there's been improvement. But he understands working-class frustration.""They feel they've intentionally been left behind by trade agreements this country imposed on them over the last 25 years,"" says Tyler.Trump's appeal here isn't restricted to working-class white men. Another local supporter is Todd Murray, president and CEO of family-owned Mursix Corp, which makes auto parts including tiny switches that go inside door locks and interior lights. His company has grown rapidly in recent years and now employs over 300 people.Murray says he knows some of Trump's trade proposals--such as putting hefty tariffs on goods from Mexico and China--could hit his own business. He exports 60 percent of his output, mostly to Mexico, and operates his own small plant in China. But he insists he's ""not smart enough to know how that would all shake out."" He still strongly favors the Republican standard bearer, who he sees as more pro-business.But the economy alone doesn't explain Trump's appeal. Another family with deep roots at BorgWarner is the Lephart clan. At one point in the 1950s and 1960s, the patriarch and nine of his sons worked there, a fact immortalized in the company magazine by a photo of the group posed on a tall step ladder, each holding a lunch bucket, except for the brother at the top, who holds the family dog.David Lephart, whose father is one of the nine brothers, avoided the decline entirely through shrewd job-hopping and retraining--but he's still a Trump supporter. He commutes to a UAW job as a pipefitter at a GM plant in Marion, Indiana. He earns about $100,000 a year, with overtime, he says, and has put both of his children through college.The 58-year-old says one thing that influenced his transition from Democrat to Republican was talking to his children, whom he describes as part of the ""business world."" His son is now a stockbroker in Indianapolis.""For the first half of my life, I thought Democrat was the only way to be,"" Lephart says. ""There's this belief that you can't be Republican and union--but I don't believe that any more."" (Data reporting by Maurice Tamman.

By Dan Whitcomb
| LOS ANGELES

LOS ANGELES California lawmakers, responding to outrage over the six-month jail term given to a former Stanford University swimmer after his conviction for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman, passed legislation on Monday closing a loophole that allowed the sentence.The bill now goes to Democratic Governor Jerry Brown for his approval. He has not indicated whether he will sign it into law.MORE FROM REUTERS:

The measure was introduced in response to the sentence given to 20-year-old Brock Turner by Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky in June, which was widely condemned as too lenient.Prosecutors had asked that Turner be given six years in state prison. He is scheduled to be released on Friday from jail in Northern California.""Sexually assaulting an unconscious or intoxicated victim is a terrible crime and our laws need to reflect that,"" Democratic Assemblyman Bill Dodd, a co-author of the legislation, said in a written statement following its passage.
Turner was convicted of assault with intent to commit rape, penetration of an intoxicated person and penetration of an unconscious person in the January 2015 attack. Under California law, those charges are not considered rape because they did not involve penile penetration.The uproar over the sentence, fueled in part by the victim's harrowing letter in which she detailed the assault in graphic terms, comes amid growing outrage over sexual assault on U.S. college campuses.""This bill is about more than sentencing, it's about supporting victims and changing the culture on our college campuses to help prevent future crimes,"" Dodd said.
The case has also led to efforts to remove Persky from the bench. Earlier this month, the judge asked for a transfer to civil court.According to the legislators, current California law calls for a mandatory prison term in cases of rape or sexual assault where force is used, but not when the victim is unconscious or severely intoxicated and thus unable to resist.The bill, which faced no serious opposition in the Democratic-controlled legislature, would eliminate a judge's discretion to sentence defendants convicted of such crimes to probation. Under its provisions, Turner would have faced a minimum of three years behind bars.  (Reporting by Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Leslie Adler and Peter Cooney)"	['Turner', 'Trump', 'Rubio']	[]

WASHINGTON The United States and India signed an agreement on Monday governing the use of each other's land, air and naval bases for repair and resupply, a step toward building defense ties as they seek to counter the growing maritime assertiveness of China.The agreement, a relatively mundane one concerning day-to-day military logistics, is nonetheless a milestone in the U.S.-India defense relationship because of the outsized political importance it had taken on in India, where it had touched on domestic sensitivities, experts said. The signing of the agreement will ""make the logistics of joint operations so much easier and so much more efficient,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said in a news briefing with Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar.The agreement will allow the Indian and U.S. navies to have an easier time supporting each other in joint operations and exercises and when providing humanitarian assistance, Parrikar said.Washington's desire for deeper security cooperation with India had been complicated without the signing of the logistics agreement as well as two other pacts that would allow for secure communications and the exchange of nautical and other data. The agreements are considered routine between the United States and its other defense partners.But India has had concerns such an agreement would commit it to hosting U.S. troops at its bases, or draw it into a military alliance with the United States and undermine its traditional autonomy. Carter and Parrikar reached an agreement ""in principle"" in April, but had yet to finalize the details.Carter has made closer military ties with India a priority, and established a special unit within the Pentagon last year to promote cooperation with that country. Parrikar's visit to Washington this week marks the sixth interaction between the two top defense officials.
The signing of the logistics agreement indicates the priority the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi places on a closer defense relationship with the United States, said Benjamin Schwartz, until last year the India country director at the Pentagon. ""For years, there has been tremendous misinformation put out into the Indian press about these agreements,"" said Schwartz, now with the U.S.-India Business Council, which promotes trade ties between the two countries.""What the signing of this shows is that the Modi government is willing to take and suffer the short-term political criticism of signing these things for the longer-term benefit of building the defense relationship with the United States.""Both Carter and Parrikar went to pains on Monday to make clear that the logistics agreement did not allow for basing of U.S. troops in India.
""It's not a basing agreement of any kind,"" Carter said.The debate over the logistics agreement had served as a vehicle for the distrust some of India's political class has towards the United States, said Shane Mason, a research associate at the Stimson Center. The United States had previously imposed sanctions on India related to its 1998 nuclear test, although the sanctions were eased later.""From the U.S. perspective this was kind of a low hanging fruit,"" Mason said. ""We have logistic support agreements with many, many other countries and in most cases it's a relatively uncontroversial thing.""
The U.S. military has made clear it wants to do more with India, especially in countering China, which U.S. officials say is risking stoking conflict through its claims in the South China Sea, a vital trade waterway.Without naming China, both Carter and Parrikar mentioned the importance of the free flow of trade to both countries.""India and the United States have a shared interest in freedom of navigation and overflight and unimpeded commerce as part of rule-based order in (the) Indo-Pacific,"" Parrikar said.China hoped cooperation between India and the United States would be ""constructive and positive"" for the region's peace and stability and development, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters at a regular briefing on Tuesday.""So, we look favorably on this sort of normal relationship between India and the United States,"" Hua said.
