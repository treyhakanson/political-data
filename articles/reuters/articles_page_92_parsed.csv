WASHINGTON New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio warned Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday against embracing the ""stop and frisk"" police tactic that he said would worsen relations between police and community in the country.Trump has praised the anti-crime tactic in which police stop, question and search pedestrians for weapons or contraband and said on Fox News on Thursday it ""massively changed"" the crime statistics in New York City.""Stop and frisk worked,"" Trump said on Fox & Friends on Thursday. He said the crime-ridden city of Chicago needed to adopt the tactic. De Blasio rejected that claim and attributed the sharp drop in crime to another strategy adopted by Bill Bratton, the city's longtime police commissioner who retired less than a week ago.Bratton championed the ""broken windows"" policing strategy that emphasizes pursuit of crimes no matter how minor. In his resignation letter he attributed the decline in crime in New York City, the nation's largest with 8.5 million people, to additional officers and an emphasis on building bonds within neighborhoods. ""Donald Trump talks about stop and frisk like he knows the facts,"" de Blasio said in an interview with CNN. ""He has had no experience with policing, no experience with public safety. 
""He should really be careful because if we reinstitute stop and frisk all over this country, you would see a lot more tension between police and community.""Police tactics and deadly encounters with African-Americans, many of them unarmed, have sparked protests and unrest across the country. A state of emergency was declared in Charlotte, North Carolina, after a second night of unrest sparked by the fatal police shooting of a black man.There have also been protests in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in recent days demanding the arrest of a police officer seen in a video last week fatally shooting an unarmed black man who had his hands in clear view at the time. 
The stop and frisk policy gained traction in New York City under Mayor Rudy Giuliani, now a top Trump supporter. De Blasio promised to end the practice during his 2013 mayoral campaign.De Blasio also credited the continued drop in crime in New York City in recent decades to a crime reduction strategy adopted by Bratton called CompStat, which adopts statistical strategies to achieve more effective policing.
""That's what changed things in New York City,"" de Blasio said, adding crime has gone down in the three years since his administration curtailed the use of stop and frisk.(Fixes ninth paragraph to say protesters demanding arrest, officer not arrested.)

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama intends to veto by Friday evening legislation allowing survivors and families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia, the White House said.White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters the president will veto Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act within the constitutionally mandated 10-day window, which ends Friday evening.
The Obama administration opposed the bill on grounds that other countries could use the law as an excuse to sue U.S. diplomats, service members or companies.

Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump face off on Monday in the first of a series of televised debates that could prove crucial to who wins the White House on Nov. 8.The first debate will take place at Hofstra University on New York state's Long Island. The Commission on Presidential Debates has scheduled two more such presidential matchups and a vice presidential debate in October.The rhetorical contests, which first appeared on television in 1960, have provided some of the most memorable moments and quotations in modern American political history. Here is a look at the highlights over more than five decades.1960: Seventy million viewers watched the first televised American presidential debate, which pitted Republican Vice President Richard Nixon against Democratic nominee John F. Kennedy. Nixon was recovering from a hospital visit and had a 5-o'clock shadow, having refused makeup. In contrast, Kennedy's delivery was smooth and charismatic. Viewers focused on what they saw, not what they heard. Kennedy won the election.1976: In the first TV debate in 16 years, Democrat Jimmy Carter faced off against unelected incumbent President Gerald Ford. This was also the first time vice presidential candidates debated on television, with Republican U.S. Senator Bob Dole squaring off against Democratic U.S. Senator Walter Mondale. Carter benefited when Ford said: ""There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration."" News media played up Ford's remark as a major blunder, and many analysts thought it helped Carter win the  election.1980: Carter appeared only in a second debate with Republican Ronald Reagan after boycotting the first one because it included a third-party candidate, John Anderson. The president accused Reagan of planning to cut Medicare healthcare funding for the elderly. Reagan, who had complained Carter was misrepresenting his stands on any number of issues, said: ""There you go again,"" and chuckled, prompting audience laughter and coining a catchphrase. Reagan won the election. The encounter attracted 80.6 million viewers, the highest number ever for a presidential debate, according to ratings company Nielsen.1984: Reagan, 73, successfully defused the issue of his age during the second debate with Democratic candidate Walter Mondale, 56, when he quipped: ""I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience."" Reagan was re-elected.
1988: The second presidential debate involving Republican Vice President George H.W. Bush and Democratic challenger Michael Dukakis opened with a question to the Massachusetts governor on whether he would favor the death penalty for someone who raped and murdered his wife. The question was posed to bring out the human side of a candidate dubbed ""the Ice Man."" His laborious response on an emotional issue did just the opposite. Bush won the election.The vice presidential debate came alive when U.S. Senator Dan Quayle, Bush's running mate, compared himself politically to John F. Kennedy. Democratic U.S. Senator Lloyd Bentsen replied in quiet, deadly tones: ""Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy."" 1992: This year's three debates became the first time three candidates - Bush, Democrat Bill Clinton, and independent Ross Perot - shared the platform. Clinton won the election.
1996: In the second debate between Republican Bob Dole and Clinton, Dole was asked by a student whether at 73 he was too old to understand the needs of young people. He replied that at his age, intelligence and experience meant he had the advantage of wisdom. Clinton retorted: ""I can only tell you that I don't think Senator Dole is too old to be president. It's the age of his ideas that I question."" Clinton was re-elected.2000: Vice President Al Gore and Republican contender George W. Bush took part in three debates. ""We all make mistakes. I've been known to mangle a syllable or two myself,"" Bush said during the second of the debates, purposely mispronouncing the word ""syllable."" During the first encounter, Gore drew negative reviews for sighing loudly while Bush spoke. The Texas governor and son of George H.W. Bush won the election.2004: The last debate between Bush and Democratic U.S. Senator John Kerry offered voters a stark contrast in styles, with Bush sticking to simple arguments while Kerry released an array of facts to make his case. Bush was re-elected.
2008: The three Obama-John McCain encounters averaged 57.4 million viewers, more than the average for the three debates in 2004, according to Nielsen. Republican U.S. Senator McCain, his back against the wall, turned in his best performance in the last debate, but Democratic U.S. Senator Barack Obama won the White House.The vice presidential debate riveted about 69.9 million Americans, and thus tied as the second most-viewed debate ever.     Republican Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and Democratic U.S. Senator Joe Biden clashed on the economy and Iraq during a lively but polite debate. She frequently displayed a folksy style. At one point, she said: ""Aw, say it ain't so, Joe,"" adding a ""doggone it"" for good measure. Biden and Palin both said they would work to change current U.S. economic policy to make it more friendly to middle-class workers, but Biden said that McCain had called the fundamentals of the economy strong as the financial crisis broke out.2012: Obama stumbled in his first debate with Republican challenger Mitt Romney, surprising and worrying his supporters. But in the second debate, Romney, responding to a question about gender pay equality, said he had ""binders full of women"" as candidates for Cabinet posts. The phrase became a meme on social media, with tweets, original artwork and a Facebook group spoofing the former Massachusetts governor.

By Mica Rosenberg
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK A federal judge threw out a challenge to a North Carolina law that allows government officials to refuse to perform same-sex marriages if they cite religious objections, claiming the couples who brought the suit failed to establish they were harmed by the law.The six plaintiffs, who include gay couples, argued in the suit filed in U.S. District Court in Asheville that the legislation - Senate Bill 2 - allows magistrates and other officials performing marriages to put their personal beliefs before their sworn constitutional duty. The plaintiffs said on Wednesday they would appeal the ruling issued by U.S. District Judge Max Cogburn on Tuesday.Cogburn said the plaintiffs had not argued they were being directly injured by the law, but instead said that their tax dollars were not being used according to the constitution. He said they had not presented enough evidence to prove they had been harmed as taxpayers, although he did add that citizens could potentially suffer ""real or emotional harm"" as a result of the law because the magistrates decision to opt-out is secret. North Carolina's Republican-led legislature passed the law in 2015 as social conservatives nationwide pushed for so-called ""religious freedom bills"" in response to same-sex marriage becoming legal.
State legislators overrode Republican Governor Pat McCrory's veto of the measure the same month the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage across the country.Data from September 2015 showed at least 32 magistrates across the state have thus far exempted themselves as have Register of Deeds employees in five counties, according the Campaign for Southern Equality, which supported the suit.  ""Senate Bill 2 expressly declares that magistrates religious beliefs are superior to their oath of judicial office,"" said attorney Luke Largess from Tin Fulton Walker & Owen, which represented the couples in the case. ""The law spends public money to advance those religious beliefs. That is a straightforward violation of the First Amendment."" 
The office of North Carolina's Attorney General declined to comment on the case, according to spokeswoman Noelle Talley.Magistrates who ask to opt out are barred from performing any marriage, gay or heterosexual, for six months.        The nonprofit group the Liberty Counsel, which represented a magistrate as an intervenor in the case, said both the U.S. Constitution and the North Carolina Constitution require accommodation of religious beliefs even for government officials. 
North Carolina has come under fire for another law passed earlier this year that prohibits people from using public restrooms not corresponding to their biological sex. Major sports organizations including the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the National Basketball Association have moved their competitions from the state to protest the so-called bathroom bill.

By Denis Pinchuk
| MOSCOW

MOSCOW One of Vladimir Putin's closest friends said on Thursday he believed Donald Trump would be the next president of the United States and that Western leaders were no match for the Russian president.Sergei Roldugin, a childhood friend of Putin's and godfather to his eldest daughter, made international headlines earlier this year after his name featured in the leaked Panama Papers as the owner of a sprawling network of offshore accounts.Some Western media said the papers suggested Roldugin, 64, was looking after Putin's money. Putin called such reports ""a provocation"" and said Roldugin, a famous cellist, had done nothing wrong and spent the money he earned from business on buying expensive musical instruments.Speaking to reporters in the Kremlin on Thursday before Putin bestowed a state award on him, Roldugin said:""I know who will win in America. You may check it later. Trump will win."" He went on to say that politicians changed their behavior once they were in power.
""I can't say I feel euphoria about Trump winning because he said he was with Putin and Hillary (Clinton) hasn't said that. Putin has said he will work with either and he's right."" Trump, the Republican candidate, has been criticized by Clinton, his Democratic Party rival, for praising Putin as a strong leader and saying ties with Moscow should be improved at a time when Moscow and Washington are at odds over Syria and Ukraine.
The Kremlin has tried to take a neutral stance on the U.S. election, saying it will respect the choice of the American people, though  Kremlin-backed TV channels have tilted their coverage in favor of Trump, whom Putin called ""very talented.""Roldugin told reporters Putin was a more impressive leader than his various Western counterparts.""The one thing I've always admired about him is that he is not afraid to assume responsibility. He often comes under heavy criticism, but he is not afraid (of that) and says: 'Yes that's what we decided, that's what I decided.'""
""He is not afraid of taking responsibility, unlike many Western politicians and American politicians who, as far as I understand, can't bring themselves to say 'That's what I decided and that's how it will be.'""Roldugin listed German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, and U.S. President Barack Obama as being guilty of not taking responsibility and of concealing the true nature of agreements they had struck.

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate cleared the way for a $1.15 billion sale of tanks and other military equipment to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, defending a frequent partner in the Middle East recently subject to harsh criticism in Congress.The Senate voted 71 to 27 to kill legislation that would have stopped the sale.The overwhelming vote stopped an effort led by Republican Senator Rand Paul and Democratic Senator Chris Murphy to block the deal over concerns including Saudi Arabia's role in the 18-month-long war in Yemen and worries that it might fuel an ongoing regional arms race.The Pentagon announced on Aug. 9 that the State Department had approved the potential sale of more than 130 Abrams battle tanks, 20 armored recovery vehicles and other equipment to Saudi Arabia.The Defense Security Cooperation Agency said General Dynamics Corp would be the principal contractor for the sale.
Paul, Murphy and other opponents of the arms deal were sharply critical of the Riyadh government during debate before the vote, citing Yemen, the kingdom's human rights record and its international support for a conservative form of Islam.""If you're serious about stopping the flow of extremist recruiting across this globe, then you have to be serious that the ... brand of Islam that is spread by Saudi Arabia all over the world, is part of the problem,"" Murphy said.The criticism came days before lawmakers are expected to back another measure seen as anti-Saudi, a bill that would allow lawsuits against the country's government by relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks.
President Barack Obama has promised to veto that bill, but congressional leaders say there is a strong chance that lawmakers will override the veto and let the measure become law. Overriding a presidential veto requires a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate.In Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition is battling Iranian-allied Houthis, the Houthis have accused the United States of arming and supporting the Saudis, who intervened on the side of Yemen's exiled government.
The war has killed over 10,000 people and displaced more than 3 million.But backers of the deal said Saudi Arabia is an important U.S. ally in a war-torn region, deserving of U.S. support.""This motion comes at a singularly unfortunate time and would serve to convince Saudi Arabia and all other observers that the United States does not live up to its commitments,"" Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said.

By Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican Marco Rubio, the failed U.S. presidential contender, is battling to hold on to his U.S. Senate seat from Florida in what is shaping up to be the costliest congressional contest of 2016.More than $33 million has been raised and over $24 million spent so far by both parties in the Florida race, according to the latest U.S. Federal Election Commission data.That high price tag testifies, in part, to Rubio's success in building a national fundraising base as a presidential candidate, even though he was trounced in his own backyard by eventual nominee Donald Trump in the state's Republican presidential nominating contest.It also underscores Republicans' firm belief that if they cannot hold Rubio's seat, they cannot hold the Senate.Rubio's re-election bid, launched late in the game in June, is bolstered by the deep pockets of the Senate Leadership Fund. The group's mission is to protect the Republican Senate majority in the Nov. 8 election. It is run by confidants of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.So far, the group has devoted more money to Florida than any other state, spending $3.4 million to attack Rubio's Democratic opponent, U.S. Representative Patrick Murphy, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog group.The Republican fund is sitting on a mountain of cash - at least $40 million on hand for the closing weeks of Senate campaigns nationwide. That looks to be having an impact. Rubio led Murphy by an average of 5.7 percentage points on Wednesday in RealClear Politics' basket of polls for Aug. 31 to Sept. 19.With that in view, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has decided to scale back its plans for television and internet advertisements for Murphy in Florida to $6 million from $10 million between now and Nov. 8, a DSCC official said.
Even the remaining money is being held back until the final three weeks of the campaign, the official added.Instead, Democrats are redeploying into lower-cost media markets in North Carolina, Missouri and Indiana, according to the DSCC, which works to elect more Democrats to the Senate.MURPHY DOWN, NOT OUT

Until June 22, when Rubio decided he wanted to return to the Senate despite a low attendance record in his first term, Democrats saw Florida as low-hanging fruit. That was because Republicans had fielded a roster of candidates with limited statewide appeal and money-raising ability.Rubio, hoping to remain a rising Republican star with an eye on a 2020 run for president, quickly cleared the field, knocking out his last Republican opponent, a wealthy political novice, and setting up his race against Murphy.As of Aug. 10, Rubio had raised $14.2 million and spent $6.3 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, citing Federal Election Commission figures. Murphy had raised $11.2 million and spent $7.8 million.Despite the money disadvantage, Murphy is by no means vanquished. A Sept. 16-19 poll by Monmouth University had Rubio leading by only 2 percentage points, and showed Murphy enjoying a 14-point lead in Rubio's home base of South Florida.If the numbers improve further for Murphy, the DSCC could readjust and, like a race-track bettor, scurry to plunk down millions of new dollars in a renewed Florida push.
Last week, a Democratic political action committee and the AFSCME labor union announced a $1.8 million anti-Rubio ad campaign as part of a $10 million ad plan.While money plays an outsized role, it is not everything in this freewheeling U.S. election season. For instance, the political fortunes of Republican presidential nominee Trump could benefit other Republicans, including Rubio. Trump has opened a 4-point lead against Democratic presidential nominee  Hillary Clinton in Florida, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos polling.In a Senate hallway interview, Rubio downplayed any Trump effect, even a positive one, saying: ""I always feel like I need to win my own race."" Rubio has endorsed Trump, but clashed sharply with him when they were presidential rivals.U.S. Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, who heads the National Republican Senatorial Committee emphasized the importance of Florida to Republicans' hopes of keeping control of the Senate.Asked about Democrats refocusing resources from Florida to other states, Wicker said: ""If they take their money out and put it someplace else, we'll combat it there,"" adding: ""We are going to stay vigilant in the state of Florida.""

U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday warned Ukraine needs to live up to its promises economic and political reforms or risk seeing the European Union walk away from its sanctions on Russia.""We know that if they give an excuse to the EU, there are at least five countries right now that want to say 'We want out'"" of sanctions against Moscow, Biden said, speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.Europe imposed sanctions after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014. Fighting has continued in the east of the country, despite the so-called Minsk ceasefire agreement, and Western powers fear peace efforts could unravel.In exchange for financial support from the United States and other Western allies, Ukraine promised reforms, but progress has been mixed.
Biden's comments came a day after he met with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko at the United Nations, pushing on reforms in Ukraine's energy and justice sectors, while saying conditions had been met for a third U.S. sovereign loan guarantee of up to $1 billion.Biden said he has spent two to three hours a week on the phone with Ukrainian leaders since the crisis began, urging them to persist with reforms, while also pressuring Germany, France and Italy to hold fast on sanctions.
""There's an overwhelming instinct in Europe to say, 'Hey: before [Poroshenko] became president, this was owned by Russia anyway. They had a puppet there. What difference does it make? What the hell's the difference? Why are you making us engage in these sanctions?'"" Biden said.Noting a crisis of ""self-doubt"" in Europe caused by the United Kingdom's referendum decision to leave the bloc and the Syrian migration crisis, Biden said he has warned Poroshenko to make sure that the failure of the Minsk deal is not blamed on Ukraine.
""I've been the guy on the back of Ukrainians - which was a thoroughly corrupt system when they came in - making the case that, 'You have to understand: everybody's willing to blame the victim, and you better straighten up and fly right,'"" Biden said.

By Jonathan Allen
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Former U.S. President Bill Clinton on Wednesday called running his family's charitable foundation one of the great honors of his life in a passionate defense against criticism of its work as his wife, Hillary Clinton, campaigns to become president.Speaking onstage in a New York City hotel ballroom for about an hour, he told supporters of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation that it had brought about ""a profound advance in the conduct and impact of modern philanthropy."" ""Don't give up what brought you here,"" he said, closing out the 12th and final annual conference organized by the foundation, called the Clinton Global Initiative. ""You have done something good and noble and worthy.""The foundation, which Clinton founded as he prepared to leave the White House in 2001, has come under intense scrutiny brought about by a long presidential campaign. Journalists have scoured newly released email records from Hillary Clinton's tenure running the State Department from 2009 to 2013, which show foundation officials seeking meetings with Clinton or other diplomats on behalf of donors. Donald Trump, Clinton's Republican opponent for the presidency, has called for a special prosecutor to investigate allegations of breaching government ethics rules.
The Clintons have said that even if some of their wealthiest donors, which include corporations and foreign governments with interests before the U.S. government, may have hoped for special favors in return, none were granted.To avert suggestions of conflicts of interest, the foundation has said it will drastically limit its operations if Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, wins the election to succeed Barack Obama on Nov. 8. It would stop accepting money from foreign and corporate donors, foundation officials say, and much of its work would be spun off into independent entities not controlled by the Clintons.
Bill Clinton, 70, has expressed frustration that political journalists covering his wife's campaign have written more about the foundation's donors, which include the government of Saudi Arabia and foreign billionaires, than the charitable programs it runs. He spoke at length about how he had been moved by meeting children with HIV in Cambodia, orphans left behind by the 2004 tsunami that struck Indonesia and victims of the earthquake in Haiti in 2010.He made only oblique references to the 2016 election campaign.
""Everywhere today there is a temptation to say that everything I just told you is wrong, 'Life is a zero-sum game and I'm losing; no, you're wrong, our differences matter more than our common humanity,'"" he said. ""These are not the right choices.""(Refiles to make clear in paragraph 5 that foundation officials were seeking the meetings on behalf of donors.)

By Eric M. Johnson
| SEATTLE

SEATTLE A number of U.S. cities are introducing proposals to mandate community oversight of police use of digital surveillance technology as evidence mounts that black or poor neighborhoods are being more heavily scrutinized than others, civil rights activists said on Wednesday.The legislative measures are being introduced by lawmakers in 11 cities from Seattle to Washington, D.C., and are backed by a coalition of 17 groups led by the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.""(We need) to build the legislative power of local communities to prevent high-tech racial profiling and policing from turning our neighborhoods into open-air prisons,"" Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice, told reporters on a conference call during which the proposals were announced on Wednesday.The coalition said the proposals stemmed from the growing use by departments across the country of high-tech equipment or software, some of which was developed for battlefields, to surreptitiously monitor poor or predominately black neighborhoods, Muslims, or the street-level movements of activists within the Black Lives Matter movement.
The proposed bills would mandate city council approval of the use and purchase of surveillance equipment, and input and oversight from communities on how it is used.""We want to give municipalities the ability to say 'no,'"" Cyril said. 
Proposals were introduced on Wednesday in Miami Beach and Pensacola, Florida, and others were expected in the coming weeks in New York City, Milwaukee, Muskegon, Michigan, and other localities, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said.Palo Alto, California, will vote on its proposal later in September, and Hattiesburg, Mississippi, is introducing legislation in October, the ACLU said.
Police departments across the United States are facing intense scrutiny over the use of excessive force especially against black people, accountability and accusations of racial bias.Police officials have said digital surveillance tools are needed for crime prevention and pointed to reduced crime in some areas where they are used.The coalition said blacks have been disproportionately targeted by automatic license plate readers in Oakland, California, closed-circuit television surveillance in Lansing, Michigan, a 'stingray' that mimics cell phone towers to track a phone user's location in Baltimore, Maryland, and social media monitoring software."
