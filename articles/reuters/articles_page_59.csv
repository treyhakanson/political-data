By Emily Stephenson and Chris Kahn
| NEWTOWN, Pa./NEW YORK

NEWTOWN, Pa./NEW YORK Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gained on his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton among American voters this week, cutting her lead nearly in half, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling released on Friday.The polling data showed Trump's argument that the Nov. 8 election is ""rigged"" against him has resonated with members of his party.""Remember folks, it's a rigged system,"" Trump told a Pennsylvania rally on Friday. ""That's why you've got to get out and vote, you've got to watch. Because this system is totally rigged.""Clinton led Trump 44 percent to 40 percent, according to the Oct. 14-20 Reuters/Ipsos poll, a 4-point lead. That compared with 44 percent for Clinton and 37 percent for Trump in the Oct. 7-13 poll released last week.An average of national opinion polls by RealClearPolitics shows Clinton 6.2 percentage points ahead at 48.1 percent support to Trump's 41.9 percent.Trump is slated to give a speech Saturday in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, best known as the site of a decisive Civil War battle and cemetery, and the place where Republican President Abraham Lincoln delivered his famous address.Aides told reporters on Friday night that Trump would make his closing argument to voters in his speech, and preview what he would do in his first 100 days in the White House.""I think this site is fitting in terms of understanding a positive vision for the Republican party,"" an aide said.Trump's campaign was thrown into crisis after a 2005 video released this month showed him bragging about groping and kissing women. He has since faced accusations - which he has said are ""absolutely false"" - that he made improper sexual advances to women over decades.The Reuters/Ipsos survey found 63 percent of Americans, including a third of Republicans, believe the New York real estate mogul has committed sexual assault in the past.
Reuters contacted a few of the poll respondents who said they felt that Trump had likely ""committed sexual assault"" but were still supporting his candidacy. Their answers were generally the same: Whatever Trump did with women in the past is less important to them than what he may do as president.At a Trump rally in Fletcher, North Carolina, Harold Garren, 75, said he was skeptical of complaints from women about Trump's behavior. ""I don't believe all of this 30 years later, no,"" Garren said.Garren also shrugged off Trump's lewd bragging about women, caught on the 2005 tape. ""I've used that barnyard language myself,"" Garren said, clarifying that it was when he was younger and before he knew better.Both candidates spent Friday in battleground states, where the vote could swing either way. Clinton, 68, campaigned in Ohio, while Trump, 70, was in North Carolina and Pennsylvania.Trump, his voice lacking some of its usual energy in his third rally in one day, told voters in Newtown, Pennsylvania they had to vote or else he would have wasted a lot of ""time, energy and money.""
'RIGGED' MESSAGE FINDS SUPPORT
Trump has been coy about whether he will accept the results of the election should Clinton beat him.The Reuters/Ipsos data showed only half of Republicans would accept Clinton as their president, and nearly 70 percent of them said a Clinton victory would be because of illegal voting or vote rigging.Trump's crowd chanted ""Lock her up!"" at a rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania after he declared Clinton a ""corrupt globalist,"" a reference to campaign documents released by WikiLeaks in which Clinton was quoted advocating free trade and open borders.
After the chant went around the room for several seconds, Trump responded, ""Don't worry, that whole thing will be looked into.""The New York businessman's assertion that the election is being rigged and his refusal to commit to accepting the outcome of the election if he loses has challenged a cornerstone of American democracy and outraged Democrats and many Republicans.Asked if he would commit to a peaceful transition of power during Wednesday's debate, Trump replied: ""What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense. OK?""In Ohio on Friday, Clinton called his refusal unprecedented. ""Now make no mistake: by doing that, he is threatening our democracy,"" she told a rally in Cleveland.""But we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship, right? And the peaceful transition of power is one of the things that sets us apart,"" Clinton said.Trump has offered no widely accepted evidence to back up his claims of vote-rigging. Numerous studies have shown that the U.S. election system, which is run by the states, is sound.Trump told an earlier rally in Fletcher, North Carolina, that he wanted to have no regrets about whether he worked hard enough to win the election, and urged followers to get out to vote.""Win, lose or draw - and I'm almost sure if the people come out, we're going to win - I will be happy with myself,"" he said. ""We have to work, we have to get everybody out there.""

| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Donald Trump has repeatedly called this year's presidential election rigged and has coyly said ""I will keep you in suspense"" on whether he would accept a Hillary Clinton victory, but many Republicans are less circumspect, according to a new poll.Only half of Republicans would accept Clinton, the Democratic nominee, as their president. And if she wins, nearly 70 percent said it would be because of illegal voting or vote rigging, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday.Conversely, seven out of 10 Democrats said they would accept a Trump victory and less than 50 percent would attribute it to illegal voting or vote rigging, the poll showed.The findings come after repeated statements by Trump that the media and the political establishment have rigged the election against him. He also has made a number of statements encouraging his supporters to fan out on Election Day to stop ineligible voters from casting ballots.The U.S. government has accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations and state election systems.Clinton has said she will accept the results of the election no matter the outcome.The poll showed there is broad concern across the political spectrum about voting issues such as ineligible voters casting ballots, voter suppression, and the actual vote count, but Republicans feel that concern more acutely.For example, nearly eight out of 10 Republicans are concerned about the accuracy of the final vote count. And though generally they believe they will be able to cast their ballot, only six out of 10 are confident their vote will be counted accurately.
Among Democrats, about six out of 10 are concerned about the vote count. They, too, believe they wi1l be able to cast their ballot, but eight out of 10 are confident their vote will be counted accurately.""Republicans are just more worried about everything than Democrats,"" said Lonna Atkeson, a professor at the University of New Mexico and head of the Center for the Study of Voting, Elections, and Democracy.FLEE THE COUNTRY?
Additionally, seven out of 10 Republicans are concerned about issues such as vote buying, faulty voting machines, or confusing ballot designs. Six out of 10 Democrats feel the same way.
Nearly eight out of 10 Republicans are concerned that ineligible voters, including non-citizens, will illegally cast ballots. Four out of 10 Democrats feel the same way.Six out of 10 respondents, regardless of party, say they are concerned about issues such as voter intimidation and suppression. Atkeson said the level of concern and mistrust in the system, especially among Republicans, is unprecedented.""I've never seen an election like this. Not in my lifetime. Certainly not in modern history."" The difference, she said, is Trump. ""It has to be the candidate effect."" 
She worries that the lack of trust is dangerous. It is one thing to not trust government, but quite another to doubt the election process. ""Then the entire premise of democracy comes into question,"" she said.About one in five Democrats said they would protest if their candidate loses. Slightly fewer Republicans said they would do the same. Fewer than one in 10 Democrats said they are prepared to take up arms in opposition compared to fewer than one in 20 Republicans.Democrats are also are three times as likely to say they would leave the country.There is one area where there is little disagreement: Most people do not expect the losing candidate to concede the race gracefully. The poll surveyed 1,192 American adults online from Oct. 17 to 21. The results have a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points. The credibility interval for Democrats is 5.1 percentage points; for Republicans it is 5.5 points.(In 4th paragraph corrects to say ""ineligible,"" not ""illegible"") (Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Leslie Adler)"

| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Donald Trump gained on Hillary Clinton among American voters this week, cutting her lead nearly in half despite a string of women accusing him of unwanted sexual advances and the furor over his disputed claims that the election process is rigged, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday.The survey also showed that 63 percent of Americans, including a third of Republicans, believe the New York real estate mogul has committed sexual assault in the past, though the Republican presidential candidate has denied the recent accusations.Clinton, the Democratic former secretary of state, led Trump 44 percent to 40 percent, according to the Oct. 14-20 poll, a 4-point lead, with the Nov. 8 election fast approaching. That compared with 44 percent for Clinton and 37 percent for Trump in the Oct. 7-13 poll released last week.Clinton's lead also shrank in a separate four-way poll that included alternative party candidates: 43 percent supported her, while 39 percent supported Trump, 6 percent supported Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, and 2 percent supported Jill Stein of the Green Party.Support for Clinton had been mostly rising in the seven-day tracking poll since the last week of August, when the candidates were about tied.
The latest reading showed that Trump's deficit narrowed to what it was before a video surfaced on Oct. 7 featuring him bragging about groping and kissing women. Several women have since accused him of making unwanted sexual advances in separate incidents from the early 1980s to 2007.Trump has denied the allegations, calling them ""totally and absolutely false.""The latest poll included a separate series of questions that asked people what they thought of Trump's conduct around women. It found 63 percent of American adults, including 34 percent of likely Republican voters, agreed with the statement ""I believe Donald Trump has committed sexual assault in the past."" 
Reuters contacted a few of the poll respondents who said they felt that Trump had ""committed sexual assault"" but were still supporting his candidacy. Their answers were generally the same: Whatever Trump did with women in the past is less important to them than what he may do as president.""I'm embarrassed that our country can't come up with better candidates, to be honest with you,"" said Evelyn Brendemuhl, 83, of Hope, North Dakota. But ""he'll appoint more conservative judges, and she's (Clinton) pro-abortion, and I'm not for that.""
Gary Taylor, 59, a Republican from Colorado said his support stemmed mostly from a desire to see ""something different than the last eight years"" in the White House.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It included 1,640 people who were considered likely voters, given their voting history, registration status and stated intention to vote. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points, meaning results could vary by that much either way.The poll questions on Trump's unwanted sexual advances scandal were asked of 1,915 American adults, including 546 likely Republican voters. It had a credibility interval of 3 percentage points for all adults and 5 points for Republican voters. (Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Jonathan Oatis)"

By Jon Herskovitz

Oklahoma voting officials have denied a request from the Russian consulate in Houston to monitor the Nov. 8 general elections in the state, saying foreign delegates are not allowed into polling stations, an official said on Friday.The move comes as the U.S. government this month formally accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations to interfere with the U.S. election process.The consul general made similar requests to officials in Texas and Louisiana, local news reports said, and was rebuffed in both states. The Consulate General of the Russian Federation in Houston was not immediately available for comment. The consulate asked to have personnel in Oklahoma to study the Nov. 8 presidential election and was told that state law forbids anyone other than election officials and voters into areas where votes are being cast, said Bryan Dean, spokesman for the Oklahoma State Election Board.
In a letter provided by Oklahoma, Russian Consul General Alexander Zakharov asks to have a consulate officer ""at one of the ballot stations of Oklahoma with the goal of studying the U.S. experience in organization of (the) voting process."" Oklahoma Secretary of State Chris Benge said he hopes the Russian officials can watch the U.S. election process on TV.""It is truly an amazing system,"" he wrote back in a letter provided by the state.
U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing that individual states maintain the authority to approve or deny requests from parties to observe elections.When asked if it was a worry to have the Russian request coming on the heels of the U.S. accusations of the country trying to meddle in the vote, he replied: ""We don't have anything to hide ... and we're confident in the electoral system."" 
U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that the Russian government was conducting or orchestrating cyber attacks against the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, possibly to disrupt or discredit the election, in which Democrat Hillary Clinton faces Republican Donald Trump.A Kremlin spokesman has called the U.S. allegations ""nonsense,"" the Interfax news agency reported.

By Dan Levine
| SAN FRANCISCO

SAN FRANCISCO Donald Trump's attorneys asked a U.S. judge to bar accusations about his personal conduct that have arisen during the presidential election campaign, which would include allegations of sexual misconduct, from the upcoming civil trial over Trump University.Students at Trump University claim they were defrauded by its real estate seminars.Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has faced allegations from women that he inappropriately touched them. Trump denied those accusations.In a court filing late on Thursday, attorneys for Trump said evidence and statements from the election campaign should be barred from trial because they could unfairly prejudice the jury. The trial is set to begin on Nov. 28.Evidence including Trump's campaign speeches, tweets, his tax issues and controversy over his personal charity should not be considered by jurors, the filing said. All audio and video recordings publicized during the campaign should also be barred, the filing said, along with evidence about Trump's beauty pageants, casinos and corporate bankruptcies.
""Before trial begins in this case, prospective members of the jury will have the opportunity to cast their vote for president,"" Trump's lawyers wrote. ""It is in the ballot box where they are free to judge Mr. Trump based on all this and more.""A spokeswoman for the plaintiffs declined to comment. 
Trump's lawyers had argued that the lawsuit, filed in 2013 in a San Diego federal court, should be dismissed because the New York real estate mogul, while personally involved in developing the concept and curriculum, relied on others to manage Trump University by the time the plaintiffs purchased seminars. Trump set off an uproar earlier this year when he accused the judge overseeing the case, U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, of being biased against him because of the Trump's pledge to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico. Curiel was born in Indiana and is of Mexican descent.Trump is trailing in the polls to Democrat Hillary Clinton with less than three weeks until Election Day. 
Trump's lawyers also asked Curiel to exclude evidence about students' finances from the trial, saying the affordability of Trump University was not relevant to the trial.Lawyers for the students asked in separate court filings to bar other evidence, including testimonials attesting to the value of the seminars, partly because they are irrelevant to whether Trump University misrepresented the qualifications of its instructors.

By Ed Cropley
| JOHANNESBURG

JOHANNESBURG If Donald Trump is interested in rigged elections, Zimbabwean opposition leader Tendai Biti says he could teach him a thing or two. Biti was arrested for treason and detained for a month after daring to suggest his party had defeated President Robert Mugabe in a vote in 2008.""They denied me food. They beat me up. They put me in leg irons. They beat me in the private parts,"" Biti, a lawyer who later served as finance minister in an eventual unity government, told Reuters. ""That's real election rigging.""To opposition figures in Africa, and in other parts of the world that lack the 240-year U.S. history of peaceful transitions of power, Trump's assertion that November's U.S. presidential election will be ""rigged"", and his declaration that he may not accept the outcome, are dangerous words.""Donald Trump is a gift to all tin-pot dictators on the African continent. He is giving currency and legitimacy to rigging because if it can exist in America, it can exist anywhere,"" Biti said.""He has no idea what he's talking about, absolutely no idea,"" said Biti, who speaks from the experience of three election defeats to Mugabe, a 92-year-old ex-guerrilla who has run Zimbabwe since independence in 1980. ""It makes us cross because in Africa there's real election rigging.""Long-serving rulers who have faced U.S. criticism in the past are already using Trump's remarks to counter Washington's pro-democracy message.When Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, in power for 30 years, won re-election to his seventh term in February, U.S. officials accused his government of arresting opposition figures, harassing their supporters and intimidating the media.
Trump's comments, said Museveni's spokesman Don Wanyama, ""should be an eye-opener to them. As they sit down to lecture other countries, they should realize that it's not easy.""""Democracy is a process and it really takes time.""HORRIFIED

Trump refused during a debate on Wednesday to say whether he would respect the result of the Nov. 8 poll. That sent a chill down the spine of Musikari Kombo, a former local government minister in Kenya, where 1,500 people were killed in a wave of ethnic bloodletting unleashed by disputes over the result of a 2007 election.""I was shocked. I was horrified,"" Kombo said. ""People in Africa who have always challenged elections will say: 'You see, we are vindicated. Even in the Mother of all Democracies, the presidential candidate is not willing to accept because there is rigging.'""U.S. officials, including state governors from Trump's own Republican Party, say there is no serious vote fraud problem in the United States and the election will be clean.Nevertheless, Trump and some allies have alleged anomalies in the voter roll in cities such as Philadelphia and Chicago that could allow the votes of dead people to be counted on behalf of his opponent, Hillary Clinton.
It is hard to think what they would have made of this year's election in Gabon, where opposition leader Jean Ping cried foul after narrowly losing to President Ali Bongo, whose family have ruled the oil-producing former French colony for half a century. The focus of Ping's concern was the province of Haut-Ogooue, where results showed 95.46 percent of voters backed Bongo on a turnout of 99.9 percent, more than double anywhere else.Gabon's constitutional court - led by the long-time mistress of Bongo's father, Omar - upheld the result.""I would say to Mr. Trump 'Come to Gabon to see what a fake democracy looks like, to see what a stolen election looks like,'"" said Alexandre Barro Chambrier, a senior Ping adviser.""There is no democracy here. There is the rule of one family and one man imposing a dictatorial regime,"" he added. ""Mr Trump is not serious.""

By Amanda Becker and Emily Stephenson
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK U.S. presidential campaign tensions seeped into a high-profile charity dinner on Thursday as Donald Trump joked about sending Hillary Clinton to prison and she alluded to Trump's statements about women by estimating how he might rate the Statue of Liberty's attractiveness a four, maybe a five.The candidates shared the stage at a formal dinner in New York City named for the state's former governor, Alfred E. Smith, less than 24 hours after finishing their third and final presidential debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday.The annual event, which raises money for needy children, typically offers presidential hopefuls a respite from the tension of the campaign trail. But Trump and Clinton opted to instead trade sharpened barbs that reflected the acrimony of the 2016 White House campaign.Trump spoke first and set the room on edge with bitter jabs at his rival, with his label of Clinton as ""corrupt"" drawing boos.""With all of the heated back and forth between my opponent and me at the debate last night, we have proven that we can actually be civil to each other,"" Trump said. ""In fact just before taking the dais, Hillary accidentally bumped into me and she very civilly said, 'Pardon me.'""
""And I very politely replied, 'Let me talk to you about that after I get into office,'"" said Trump, a Republican whose supporters chant ""lock her up"" at rallies.Clinton, whose remarks elicited both polite applause and derision, riffed off Trump's derogatory remarks about women's appearances, such as joking in a 2002 radio interview that they become less attractive after age 35.""Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a four, maybe a five if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair,"" Clinton said of the New York City landmark.
""Come to think of it, you know what would be a good number for a woman? 45,"" Clinton said. The president elected on Nov. 8 will be the 45th in U.S. history.Trump and Clinton sat just a seat apart on the dais, separated by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York. At the event's conclusion, they shook hands - a gesture they avoided at Wednesday's debate. But the tone of both candidates' remarks was a departure from the past, when political figures and presidential candidates have stuck to a largely self-deprecating and good-natured brand of humor.
At one point at the event, which raised $6 million for Catholic charities supporting children, Trump said Clinton was ""pretending not to hate Catholics."" Trump was referring to the apparently hacked personal emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, published by Wikileaks, which show Clinton staffers criticizing high-profile figures for embracing Catholicism as the most ""politically acceptable"" of socially conservative religions.Alfred Smith IV, the evening's host, perhaps best reflected the tension in the room, and the campaign, in his introductory remarks: ""This has been a campaign for the history books,"" he said. ""It has also been a campaign for the psychiatry books.""     (Reporting by Emily Stephenson and Amanda Becker; Editing by Michael Perry)"

By Dan Levine and Mica Rosenberg

If Donald Trump were to challenge the outcome of next month's presidential election, as he has hinted he might, he would face a difficult and expensive fight, according to election attorneys and a review of voting laws in key battleground states.Trump has said he is worried the Nov. 8 election might be rigged in favor of his opponent, Hillary Clinton, and in Wednesday's debate he refused to say he would accept the outcome.But before any court challenge, Trump probably would have to ask for a recount, said Donald Brey, a Republican election lawyer in Ohio. If the campaign did not pursue out-of-court options first, he said, a judge likely would dismiss the case.Recount rules vary from state to state. North Carolina, for example, doesn't allow a presidential candidate to request a recount at all if one candidate has a lead of more than 0.5 percent of the total votes cast.In Wisconsin, the challenging candidate must pay the full expense of a recount if the vote in dispute is more than 0.25 percent, and in Colorado if it is more than 0.5 percent.That can be expensive. Officials in one Wisconsin village put the cost of a local recount, in which about 9,000 votes were cast earlier this year, at nearly $13,000, said Michael Maistelman, a Wisconsin election lawyer who represented the unsuccessful candidate. More than 3 million people voted in the 2012 presidential election in Wisconsin.Deciding where to challenge the election would be complicated. Trump, who trailed Clinton by 7 percentage points nationwide in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week, is fighting tight battles in some key states. In Ohio, for example, an average of major opinion polls reviewed by the RealClearPolitics website found Trump to be leading by less than 1 percentage point. In Iowa, he is leading by nearly 4 percent.In some other battleground states, polls suggest support for Trump has eroded in recent weeks. According to the RealClearPolitics website's poll tally, Clinton has substantial leads in Virginia, Colorado and Wisconsin. She leads Trump by more than 6 percentage points in Pennsylvania, nearly 4 points in Florida and more than two points in North Carolina.To maximize his chances of overturning a Clinton win, Trump might need to challenge the results in several states, said Troy McCurry, a former Republican National Committee lawyer who was part of the party's recount team in 2012.
Trump could try to bring a legal claim without first asking for recount by alleging, for instance, that an abuse of power by an election official, said McCurry, who's law firm represented Ted Cruz in the Republican primary before McCurry joined the practice.But if Trump's lawyers were unable to muster specific facts to support that premise, he said, a judge would dismiss the lawsuit.Any lawsuit that withstood early challenges would face an uncertain future. With the U.S. Supreme Court split 4-to-4 between liberal and conservative justices, state supreme courts or federal appeals courts could well make the final ruling in any election dispute. In Pennsylvania, Colorado and Florida, where a majority of both state and federal appeals court judges have Democratic affiliations, Trump might face a more difficult road.Meanwhile, appeals courts in Ohio, Wisconsin and Iowa are more heavily Republican. 
Ohio election attorney Brey, who said he dislikes but will vote for Trump, believes a challenge in Ohio would be a last-ditch effort for the candidate.""Let's put it this way,"" he said. ""If Ohio is close, Trump's already lost.""Trump also might face obstacles from his own party, attorneys said, because it would be reluctant to challenge results in a state where, say, it lost the presidential race but won a close U.S. senate race.Numerous studies have shown U.S. elections, which are decentralized and run by the states, are basically sound.
""Mr. Trump never mentions what criteria would be necessary for him to make a decision about a challenge,"" said Stephen Zack, an attorney who represented Vice President Al Gore in the case that was brought to the Supreme Court over the election recount in Florida in 2000.""Basically it is left as, 'I'll see what it smells like and then I will surprise you,'"" Zack said. ""There are rule-of-law issues that pertain to elections that separate us from anywhere else in the world.""  Election officials in several states rejected suggestions the balloting might be rigged. Eric Spencer, election director in Arizona, said that while isolated incidents of voter fraud might occur and should be investigated, election workers come from all political parties and work with integrity. ""The notion that the election is rigged is preposterous if not insulting,"" Spencer said.Some election watchers question how serious Trump is about a challenge.""A lot of this is just posturing,"" McCurry said. ""At the end of the day I don't see how this happens.""     (Reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco and Mica Rosenberg in New York; Editing by Sue Horton and Lisa Girion)"

By Patricia Zengerle and Emily Stephenson
| WASHINGTON/DELAWARE, Ohio

WASHINGTON/DELAWARE, Ohio U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Thursday he would accept the result of the Nov. 8 election - ""if I win"" - fueling Republican concerns his stance would make it harder for his party to maintain control of Congress.His refusal to commit to accepting the election outcome was the standout remark of the third and final 2016 presidential debate between Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on Wednesday night. It ratcheted up Trump's allegations the election was being rigged against him, and became the latest flashpoint in an unusually acrimonious race three weeks before voters go to the polls.Clinton called the comment ""horrifying.""President Barack Obama blasted Trump on Thursday at a rally in Miami Gardens, Florida, for Clinton and U.S. Representative Patrick Murphy, who is trying to unseat Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a Trump supporter. ""That is dangerous. Because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people's minds about the legitimacy of the elections, that undermines our democracy. Then you're doing the work of our adversaries for them,"" Obama said.Trump modified his comment at a rally in Ohio on Thursday, but did not back off. ""I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election - if I win,"" he said.He added he would accept ""a clear election result,"" but reserved the right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result.With Trump trailing in opinion polls, the focus ahead of the Nov. 8 vote is shifting to whether Republicans can keep their narrow majority in the Senate or even their larger advantage in the House of Representatives.Senator John McCain of Arizona, who lost the 2008 presidential election to Obama, said accepting the election result was ""the American way.""""I didn't like the outcome of the 2008 election. But I had a duty to concede, and I did so without reluctance,"" McCain, who has opened a poll lead in his Senate re-election race, said in a statement.""A concession isn't just an exercise in graciousness. It is an act of respect for the will of the American people, a respect that is every American leader's first responsibility.""McCain has withdrawn his support for Trump.
Asked on Wednesday night if he would commit to a peaceful transition of power, Trump, a businessman-turned-politician, replied: ""What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense. OK?""TRANSITION OF POWER
Trump's statement, the most provocative in a debate that repeatedly descended into rancor, made headlines across the country and raised questions about his commitment to a peaceful transition of power, a cornerstone of American democracy.Clinton accused Trump of being Russian President Vladimir Putin's puppet. Trump called Clinton a ""nasty woman"" and a criminal who should be barred from running. They did not exchange the customary handshake when the debate ended.On Thursday night the two candidates appeared together at a formal charity dinner in New York and shook hands there after giving speeches intended to roast each other.
""Just before taking the dais, Hillary accidentally bumped into me, and she very civilly said, 'pardon me,'"" Trump joked. ""And I very politely replied, let me talk to you about that after I get into office."" Trump has said Clinton should be imprisoned for her email practices as secretary of state.Clinton spoke after Trump at the dinner, which she joked was remarkable in itself. ""I didn't think he'd be ok with a peaceful transition of power,"" she said.That show of humor was not the norm, however.Democrats jumped to ask Republican candidates whether they agreed with Trump, who is making his first run for public office against Clinton, a former senator and first lady.""Do you agree with Donald Trump to question the results of the election?"" the Nevada Democratic Party asked in a release targeting Republican Joe Heck. Heck is in a tight race with Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto for retiring Democratic leader Harry Reid's Senate seat.Trump's comments did not worry his supporters.Marion Fields, 48, a registered Democrat who backs Trump, said he did not think concession would be an issue because Trump would win. Were he to lose, ""After it's announced, you'd have to be a professional and concede.""
A CNN/ORC snap poll said 52 percent of Americans thought Clinton won the debate, to 39 percent for Trump.Trump donor and energy investor Dan Eberhart said Trump won. He disagreed with his rhetoric, but still backs the candidate.""I think Hillary's policies and track record are not what the country needs leading us forward for the next four years. And that backs me into supporting Trump,"" Eberhart said.Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway sought on Thursday to defend Trump, saying in television interviews he was ""putting people on notice"" about voting irregularities.Trump has not offered specific evidence to back up his vote-rigging claims, and numerous studies have shown that the U.S. election system, which is run by the states, is sound.Trump has stepped up allegations that the election is being rigged against a backdrop of accusations that he had made improper sexual advances to women since a video emerged two weeks ago in which Trump boasted of such behavior.A 10th woman came forward on Thursday at a news conference in Manhattan with attorney Gloria Allred, a Clinton supporter who specializes in representing women in cases of alleged assault.Trump campaign spokeswoman Jessica Ditto called the news conference a ""coordinated, publicity-seeking attack"" by Allred.First lady Michelle Obama, a powerful campaigner for Clinton, renewed her criticism of Trump without naming him during a campaign event in Arizona.""Decent men do not demean women. And we shouldn't tolerate this behavior from any man, let alone a man who wants to be the president,"" she said.
