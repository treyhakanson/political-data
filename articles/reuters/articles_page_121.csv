U.S. representatives Jason Chaffetz and Elijah Cummings of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform sent a letter to Mylan NV Chief Executive Heather Bresch on Monday asking for documents and communications related to the fast-increasing price of allergy auto-injector EpiPens.Mylan said earlier it would launch the first generic version of EpiPen for $300, half the price of the branded product, in the drugmaker's second step in less than a week to counter a backlash over the product's steep price.
Chaffetz and Cummings, the committee's chairman and ranking member respectively, requested documents related to Mylan's revenue from sales of EpiPens since 2007, manufacturing costs and the amount the company receives from federal health care programs.

NEW YORK The Republican National Committee asked the charity of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's family on Monday to produce all correspondence its staff had with the U.S. State Department while Clinton served as America's most senior diplomat. Clinton's campaign to win the Nov. 8 presidential election has been dogged by criticism that donors to the Clinton Foundation may have expected special favors from the U.S. government in return. She says donors to the global charity receive no preferential treatment.    ""The Clinton Foundation can play a vital role in filling important gaps in the public record by demonstrating its commitment to transparency and making public all correspondence its officials had with the State Department during Secretary Clinton's tenure,"" Reince Priebus, the RNC chairman, said in a letter to the foundation's president, Donna Shalala. The RNC provided a copy of the letter to reporters.     Spokesmen for Clinton and the foundation, which is known for its work to widen access to HIV medicines in developing countries, did not respond to a request for comment.
Some emails have already emerged that show Clinton Foundation officials seeking meetings with Clinton and other diplomats on behalf of supporters who have made large donations to the foundation. Foundation officials also sought other favors, including help with visa issues or urging the government to hire certain people, emails show. Spokesmen for Clinton have noted that in several cases the requests from foundation officials were unsuccessful.
Thousands more emails from Clinton's tenure are still in the process of being released as public records. Their release was delayed in part because of Clinton's decision to use an unauthorized private email server for her work without informing record-keeping officials. In his letter, Priebus said the foundation's own records have ""the unique ability"" to establish whether donors received special treatment.    
Clinton promised President Barack Obama that her family's charities would annually disclose all their donors and seek prior approval from the State Department for any additional money given by foreign governments when Obama made her his most senior diplomat in 2009. The charities said last year they failed to comply with the promises, blaming oversights.The foundation has said it will no longer accept foreign or corporate funding for at least some of its work if Clinton is elected. Her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, will remain on the board. (Editing by Alistair Bell)"

By Roberta Rampton
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON When President Barack Obama sets out this week to meet world leaders in China and Laos during his final presidential trip to Asia, he will make an unusual stop along the way.With time running out for more action on climate change during his time in office, Obama will drop in to Midway Atoll, a far-flung and largely uninhabited coral reef that is a refuge for sharks, albatrosses and endangered turtles and seals.The photo-rich stop is aimed at both raising awareness about the threat posed by climate change, and showcasing Obama's decision to protect a larger part of the ocean around Hawaii.But the trip to the middle of the Pacific Ocean will also highlight the high stakes of climate change just before Obama meets world leaders in China.""I think it's going to be an amazing sequence, and one that really matters,"" said Doug McCauley, a conservation biologist from University of California, Santa Barbara.""Suddenly, you're sitting in a room with the leaders who will decide what the fate of that place is going to be,"" McCauley said.The rare trip is both a signal of the importance Obama gives to climate change - and a sign of his focus in bliateral meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
The two leaders have clashed on economic and security issues, but forged common ground on climate, which helped secure a global deal to cut carbon emissions at a Paris conference last year.""We have to recognize that climate change and clean energy cooperation has really helped to create better overall stability in the U.S.-China relationship, writ large,"" said Andrew Light, a former senior climate official in Obama's State Department.Light, now with the World Resources Institute think tank, said he expects Xi and Obama will try to push other G20 leaders to agree to timelines for implementing the Paris agreement and work on cutting other greenhouse gases like methane and hydrofluorocarbons.
Any progress on climate issues could be a rare bright spot in a trip otherwise dominated by concerns about the international economy, anti-globalization sentiments and global security problems.With less than five months left in the White House, Obama is racing to cement his record through actions he can take without help from the gridlocked U.S. Congress.For example, at Obama's final meeting with his Canadian and Mexican counterparts, the leaders set new goals for clean energy production.Republicans in Congress have thwarted Obama's legislative efforts on climate, and mocked him for his focus on an issue they see as less pressing than the economy and defense.
Obama also has faced criticism from environmental groups for not doing more to limit U.S. oil and gas production.""If we're going address the climate crisis or meet our climate commitments, the vast, vast majority of fossil fuels need to remain in the ground,"" said Brendan Cummings, conservation director with the Center for Biological Diversity.But former Environmental Protection Agency director Carol Browner said Obama has done what he could on climate both through leadership on the international stage, and by using existing laws to kick-start the clean energy sector and cut emissions from vehicles and power plants.""Nobody should ever be disappointed with this president on climate change,"" said Browner, who led the White House climate push in Obama's first term.

By David Morgan
| LAS VEGAS

LAS VEGAS Outside political money is pouring into a race in Nevada to replace U.S. Democratic Senator Harry Reid, who is retiring and who told Reuters that the main reason his favored successor isn't winning easily is cash from beyond the state's borders.In a race that underscores the rise of outside money in U.S. campaign finance, as well as a key demographic challenge facing the Republican Party, Catherine Cortez Masto and Joe Heck are in a dead heat to replace the Senate's No. 1 Democrat.Democrat Cortez Masto, 52, was a two-term Nevada attorney general. If she wins, she will be the first Latina elected to the U.S Senate. Republican Heck, 54, is a three-term House of Representatives member, physician and U.S. Army Reserve general.Polls show a tight race, with the two tied at 37 percent of likely voters in a mid-August Suffolk University survey. The seat they are contesting is the only one in the Senate this year that Republicans have a truly good chance of flipping to their control from the Democrats. Doing so would shield Republicans' Senate majority, which is under threat elsewhere.Saying in an interview that Heck's campaign is fueled by outside money, Reid, a former boxer, lashed out at the Koch brothers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Karl Rove.""The Chamber of Commerce is nothing more than a front anymore for the Koch brothers. Karl Rove, he doesn't raise that money. He just goes to the Koch brothers. They're all fronts for the Koch brothers,"" said Reid, 76.""Catherine's going to win. And if the Koch brothers weren't involved, she'd win by 15 points,"" Reid said.Charles and David Koch are wealthy industrialists who spend millions of dollars supporting libertarian-leaning candidates, mostly Republicans, through a network of groups, some operating under a law that lets them keep their donors' identities secret.Reid, who now walks with a cane and often appears in dark sunglasses, has long warred with the Kochs.
""We've certainly seen our fair share of criticism from Senator Reid. But we want to talk about the issues and he moves toward the politics of personal attacks,"" said James Davis, spokesman for the Koch-aligned Freedom Partners Action Fund.OUTSIDERS IN NEVADA
The Supreme Court, in its 2010 Citizens United decision, opened the door to a tidal wave of political spending by corporations and labor unions on political causes and candidates, reshaping U.S. campaign finance. More than 20 political groups, including two Koch-aligned organizations and the Reid-aligned Senate Majority PAC, have poured well over $20 million into the Nevada Senate race so far, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign spending.Overall, the spending favors Heck over Cortez Masto by nearly 2-to-1.
Freedom Partners and another Koch-aligned group, Concerned Veterans for America, have spent nearly $6 million, mostly on ads portraying Cortez Masto as captive to special interests. Rove, formerly an adviser to Republican President George W. Bush, is now a Republican activist. He co-founded Republican Super PAC American Crossroads. Spokesman Ian Prior called Reid's accusations about Rove and the Kochs ""funny.""Prior said, ""Look, if Harry Reid is looking for a bogeyman to star in his dark fantasy movie, he should just cast himself.""The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the largest lobbying group for corporations in Washington and closely aligned with the Republican Party. On Reid's allegations that it is a front for the Kochs, Chamber spokesman Blair Latoff Holmes said, ""This is not true, but it's certainly not the first time Senator Reid has made unsubstantiated allegations.""
DEMOGRAPHIC CHALLENGE
Nevada's biggest city is Las Vegas and nearly three-quarters of the state's population lives in or near the casino capital.Nevada reflects the United States' growing racial diversity. In 1970, Nevadans were 87 percent white and 6 percent Latino; by 2010, that ratio was 54 percent white and 26 percent Latino.Heck, who is white, has managed to get elected to Congress from an ethnically diverse congressional district split evenly between Republicans and Democrats. But Democrats have a 72,000-vote registration advantage over Republicans in Nevada and Latinos helped elect President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has angered many Latinos with his vow to build a wall on the Mexican border and to deport undocumented aliens. Heck has endorsed Trump.While Trump's popularity has crumbled in some other states, he has stayed within 2 percentage points of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in Nevada.Cortez Masto has been keen to link Heck to Trump. She said in an interview that Heck has followed Trump's example of ""mud-slinging, dirty campaigning.""Heck spokesman Brian Baluta said Cortez Masto has distorted  Heck's record. ""She talks about Joe more than she talks about herself and it's always in the most vile and negative way,"" Baluta said. (Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and James Dalgleish)"

By Trevor Hunnicutt
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Nearly a third of U.S. counties likely will be served by only one insurer that participates in an Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace in 2017, according to an analysis published on Sunday by the Kaiser Family Foundation.The 31 percent of U.S. counties that will have just a single option of insurers within the ACA's exchanges would represent an increase from 7 percent this year, the nonpartisan group found. Despite sharing a namesake, the Kaiser Family Foundation is not associated with healthcare provider Kaiser Permanente.UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) and Aetna Inc (AET.N) have decided to largely exit government-run online marketplaces in 2017 that sell subsidized plans created under President Barack Obama's national healthcare reform law, citing low enrollment and high service costs.
The bulk of the decrease in counties with a choice of insurers is due to UnitedHealth's pullback, which was announced in April.The data underscores the degree to which industry retrenchment is curtailing individual's options within the marketplaces. Insurer departures may lead to higher costs within that market, analysts have said.
One county - Pinal County in Arizona - risks having no insurer options at all within the marketplace, the analysis found. The study's authors said another plan offered elsewhere in the state could expand to serve the county.The foundation said it could take more months and more data for the full impact of the changes for 2017 to become clear.
""A number of steps remain before the full picture of this year's Marketplace competition is known but the ACA has greatly expanded the insurance options available to consumers in the individual marketplace,"" said Marjorie Connolly, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in a statement.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia A Bosnian Serb factory on Monday presented two pairs of shoes as a gift for the wife of U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Slovenian-born Melania, in a gesture of support for Trump's White House campaign.Many Serbs in the Balkans back Trump, ill-disposed to rival Hillary Clinton whose husband Bill backed NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions toward the end of the 1992-95 Bosnian war. He also advocated a 1999 NATO bombing of then-Yugolsavia to halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanians. Marinko Umicevic, technical director at the Banja Luka shoe factory Bema, said the gift countered what she called a ""dirty campaign"" against the aspiring First Lady whose homeland, like Bosnia, was a part of Yugoslavia when she was born.
Melania Trump's speech at the Republican National Convention in July ignited controversy, containing a section strikingly similar to words delivered at the Democratic convention in 2008 by President Barack Obama, Michelle.""The shoes for Melania Trump are our response to the dirty comments she has been exposed to as a wife and a mother,"" said Umicevic.
The shoes, to be sent by express post, were displayed for media on a table, set in a display of white roses. One pair was gold-colored, with cushioned soles fashioned, according to Umicevic, to help Melania follow her husband's campaign across America. The others were white stilettos for a triumphant walk into the White House.Umicevic said the shoe moulds were made by a factory in Melania Trump's hometown of Sevnice and designed by Bema's best shoe designers.
""We hope that America will stop being the world policeman,"" Umicevic told Reuters. ""We are hoping a friendship will come in the future from the United States instead of bombs that Serbs got from Bill Clinton,"" he added. (Writing by Maja Zuvela)"

Last week, Trump had said he was ""softening"" on his plan to deport all 11 million illegal immigrants.That stance had aroused criticism from conservatives who wanted him to stand fast after he won the Republican presidential nomination in large part with a hard-line position that called for building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.""I will be making a major speech on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION on Wednesday in the GREAT State of Arizona. Big crowds, looking for a larger venue,"" Trump, who had postponed an immigration speech originally planned for last Thursday in Denver, said in his tweet on Sunday.In another tweet on Sunday night, Trump said both he and Hillary Clinton, his Democratic rival for the Nov. 8 election, should release detailed medical records. ""I have no problem in doing so! Hillary?""
In his speech on Saturday in Iowa, Trump said he would seek to institute a tracking system to ensure illegal immigrants who overstay their visas are quickly removed, and would propose an e-verify system to prevent undocumented residents from gaining access to welfare and other benefits.""If we don't enforce visa expiration dates, then we have an open border - it's as simple as that,"" he said.
Trump said his first priority on taking office next January would be the immediate deportation of thousands of undocumented immigrants who remain in the United States despite having committed crimes.""These international gangs and cartels will be a thing of the past,"" he said. ""Their reign of terror will be over. In this task, we will always err on the side of protecting the American people - we will use immigration law to prevent crimes, and will not wait until some innocent American has been harmed or killed before taking action.""

| DES MOINES, Iowa

DES MOINES, Iowa U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump offered fresh details of how he would tackle illegal immigration on Saturday, saying he would crack down on those who overstay their visas as he sought to quiet criticism from conservatives.In a campaign speech in Des Moines, Iowa, Trump also cited the shooting death of a cousin of NBA star Dwyane Wade to urge African-American voters to rally behind him, calling it an example of violence that has to be addressed.Trump, speaking on the Iowa State Fairgrounds with hay bales stacked behind him, sought to clarify his views on how to overhaul the U.S. immigration system after saying earlier in the week that he was softening on his plan to deport all 11 million illegal immigrants.That stance drew fire from conservatives who wanted him to stand fast after he won the Republican presidential nomination in large part by a hardline stance that would include building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.In his speech, Trump said he would seek to institute a tracking system to ensure illegal immigrants who overstay their visas are quickly removed, and would propose an e-verify system to prevent the illegal community from gaining access to welfare and other benefits.""If we don't enforce visa expiration dates, then we have an open border - it's as simple as that,"" he said.In outlining his views, Trump said addressing illegal immigration is important to helping Americans find jobs.
""Every time an African-American citizen, or any citizen, loses their job to an illegal immigrant, the rights of that American citizen have been violated,"" he said. ""Equal protection under the law must include the consistent application of our immigration laws.""Trump said his first priority upon taking office next January would be the immediate deportation of thousands of illegal immigrants who remain in the United States despite having committed crimes.""These international gangs and cartels will be a thing of the past. Their reign of terror will be over. In this task, we will always err on the side of protecting the American people - we will use immigration law to prevent crimes, and will not wait until some innocent American has been harmed or killed before taking action,"" he said.
He did not explain how his plan would affect many of the illegal community who have been in the United States for decades and obeyed U.S. laws.Trump said the death in Chicago of Wade cousin Nykea Aldridge, 32, a mother of four, was an example of turmoil in U.S. inner cities. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a former chief of staff to Democratic President Barack Obama, has struggled in particular to contain violence in his city.The incident permitted Trump to bring up again his desire to be a ""law and order"" president and underscore his drive to appeal to African-American voters who traditionally vote Democratic and overwhelmingly support Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.""It breaks all of our hearts to see it, it's horrible,"" Trump said. ""And it's only getting worse. This shouldn't happen in our country. This shouldn't happen in America. We send our thoughts and our prayers to the family, and we also promise to fight for a much, much better tomorrow.""
Trump raised the subject after sending out tweets earlier in the day that prompted charges of insensitivity to the death and accusations he sought to exploit it for political purposes.The New York businessman was the headline speaker at ""Joni Ernst's Roast and Ride,"" a charity event for military veterans run by U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a Republican.Ernst and most other speakers offered praise for Trump, a rarity at a time when many Republican political leaders have distanced themselves from his candidacy due to his incendiary rhetoric.

I mean, he meets the clinical definition,"" Plouffe said in an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press"".When challenged, Plouffe acknowledged he had no degree in psychology but rattled off what he said were the New York businessman's symptoms: ""grandiose notion of self-worth; pathological lying; lack of empathy and remorse.""
The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Last week, Clinton accused Trump of fueling America's ""radical fringe"" with racist rhetoric, while Trump said Clinton was letting down black Americans with failed policies and called her a ""bigot who sees people of color only as votes, not as human beings.""Obama has also lambasted Trump, saying of him: ""Somebody who makes those kinds of statements doesn't have the judgment, the temperament, the understanding to occupy the most powerful position in the world.""
