WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate this month will debate legislation that passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives and aims to give Puerto Rico some relief from its $70 billion debt, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday.McConnell's announcement came after some House members briefed fellow Republicans in the Senate on the content of the legislation, which would establish a federal oversight board to restructure Puerto Rican debt.Backers of the House-passed bill are hoping the Senate signs off on the legislation before July 1, when Puerto Rico faces a deadline on a $1.9 billion debt payment.Representative Rob Bishop, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee, which steered the legislation through that chamber, told reporters that Republican senators peppered him with questions about the makeup of the oversight board and its powers. He added that he assured senators the bill is not a taxpayer bailout of Puerto Rico and that it would not have an impact on U.S. states.Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory and some critics of the bill have expressed concerns that a control board appointed by Washington might not have the Caribbean island's best interests in mind.The legislation also got a boost, albeit a tepid one, on Tuesday when Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch offered qualified support for the House bill. He added that he was considering offering changes to the bill but did not elaborate.
Hatch's Finance Committee has oversight of the Puerto Rico debt legislation.Some Senate Democrats also have expressed reservations with the bill and indicated that they could seek amendments, but it was not clear if they actually would.Any changes made by the Senate to the House-passed bill would send it back to the House to accept, reject or make further amendments.
Bishop left open the possibility of July 1 arriving with Congress still working on the Puerto Rico bill.""It's not the end of the world,"" Bishop said of the possibility of Congress putting finishing touches on legislation into July.
""Market forces, as long as they realize we're moving forward to a solution and we're close to it, I think that would mitigate against anything that would be negative that would impact the entire market,"" Bishop added.The Obama administration has voiced its support for the House bill, which passed on a strong, bipartisan vote of 297-127.Puerto Rico, which suffers from a poverty rate of around 45 percent, has been hobbled by its worsening debt problems, with some schools and medical facilities closing and island residents fleeing to the mainland United States where many find jobs, primarily in central Florida.

| ORLANDO, Fla.

ORLANDO, Fla. Orlando nightclub killer Omar Mateen had expressed sympathy for a variety of Islamist extremists, including groups in the Middle East that are sworn enemies, the FBI said on Monday, as a picture began to emerge of the angry, violent man who carried out America's deadliest mass shooting.U.S. authorities said they had found no direct links between Islamic State and Mateen, the U.S.-born son of Afghan immigrants who killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando on Sunday.       Mateen, 29, was shot dead by police who stormed the Pulse club with armored cars after a three-hour siege. In 911 calls during his rampage, the killer expressed allegiance to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.    But Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said Mateen had made comments favorable to multiple armed Islamist movements and people, which ""adds a little bit to the confusion about his motives."" President Barack Obama said Mateen was likely a homegrown extremist. ""So far, we see no indication that this was a plot directed from outside the United States and we see no indication that he was part of any kind of network,"" Comey told reporters in Washington. ""We're highly confident this killer was radicalized at least in some part through the internet.""    Islamic State, which controls territory in Iraq and Syria, reiterated on Monday a claim of responsibility, although it offered no signs to indicate coordination with the gunman.        In calls to authorities on Sunday, Mateen also mentioned support for the Boston Marathon bombers and a Florida man who became a Nusra Front suicide bomber in Syria, Comey said. Nusra is an al Qaeda offshoot which is at odds with Islamic State in Syria's civil war.        Co-workers reported Mateen to the FBI in 2013 after he had made ""inflammatory and contradictory"" statements, including a claim that he had family connections to al Qaeda and membership of Shi'ite militant group Hezbollah, a bitter rival.The FBI's Miami office investigated Mateen for 10 months and interviewed him twice but found no evidence of a crime or connection with a militant group. Comey said the FBI was also ""working to understand what role anti-gay bigotry may have played"" in the attack. The massacre reverberated on the presidential campaign trail, where Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, the two likely opponents in the Nov. 8 election, clashed over how to confront violent Islamist extremists.    Trump proposed suspending immigration to the United States from countries with a history of terrorism against America, Europe or U.S. allies, while Clinton warned against demonizing Muslims and called for tougher gun safety measures.Obama is to visit Orlando on Thursday to pay respects to families of the victims.'NEEDLES IN NATIONWIDE HAYSTACK'

The Orlando killings followed the massacre of 14 people in San Bernardino, California, last year and raised the question of whether the United States will have to confront jihadist attacks in the homeland for years to come. Comey said tracking apparent lone wolf attackers like Mateen was like finding ""needles in a nationwide haystack"" while also trying to work out what kind of people could become radicalized.The Florida shooting spree began early on Sunday when the club was packed with some 350 revelers at a Latin music night. Many fled as the gunman raked the crowd with bullets from an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle and a pistol.An initial wave of officers charged into the club and trapped Mateen in a bathroom, Orlando Police Chief John Mina told reporters. That allowed many patrons to flee, although others were trapped in the restroom with Mateen, leading to a standoff.Police negotiated with Mateen for about three hours before breaking a hole in the wall, which allowed hostages to escape.Mateen also emerged from the hole and was shot dead by officers, police said.Some 53 people were wounded and 29 remain hospitalized at Orlando Regional Medical Center. Michael Cheatham, chief trauma surgeon at the hospital, told Fox News he expects all of the survivors in the hospital to survive. 
DANCING, THEN DEATH 
Amanda Alvear's last Snapchat video post began with a shot of her on the dance floor of the nightclub surrounded by friends. It ended with gunshots ringing out over the music.Alvear, 25, was identified by police as one of those killed at Pulse. Her friend Mercedez Flores, 26, who worked for Target,  was also on the list.Another victim was Edward Sotomayor, 34, a marketing manager at a Florida-based gay-themed travel company. He was a legend in the industry, his boss, Al Ferguson, said. Pastor Deyni Ventura visited a survivor in the hospital, whom she identified only as Norman, who had taken refuge in a handicapped bathroom stall crammed with 30 people.Norman could hear the shooter laughing loudly as he sprayed gunfire over and under the bathroom stall. ""They couldn't see the shooter but they could hear him laughing,"" Ventura said, intimating a loud cackling laugh.Norman, who was shot four times, crawled over the bodies of his friends to safety. Everyone else in the stall died, Ventura said.
Most of the people fatally shot were Latino, more than half of them of Puerto Rican origin and at least three of them Mexican citizens.Hundreds of people attended a vigil on Monday night for the dead in downtown Orlando.        VIOLENT AND ANGRY 
Law enforcement officials searched for clues as to whether anyone had worked with Mateen on the attack, said Lee Bentley, the U.S. attorney for the middle district of Florida.But officials said they believed there had been no other attackers and had no evidence of a threat to the public.Mateen's ex-wife, Sitora Yusifiy, described him as mentally unstable and violent toward her.""He would get mad out of nowhere. That's when I started worrying about my safety and then after a few months he started abusing me physically very often,"" she told reporters. The couple split in 2009 after four months of marriage.    When Mateen met with his father the day before the killing, he betrayed nothing of the rage that would soon erupt. ""I didn't notice anything wrong,"" Seddique Mateen said in an interview. ""He was very slick.""In the close-knit Muslim community of about 100 families in Fort Pierce, Florida, Mateen was known as quiet with few friends.""He wasn't a people person. He was not extremely friendly but he wasn't rude either,"" said Mohammed Jameel, 54, who worshipped at his mosque.    Mateen was an armed guard at a gated retirement community, and had worked for the global security firm G4S (GFS.L) for nine years..         He told the FBI during its investigation of him that he had made pro-Islamist remarks because he was angry at co-workers who he felt were discriminating against him and teasing him for being a Muslim, Comey said.

| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND Three groups planning to demonstrate at the Republican National Convention in July sued the city of Cleveland on Tuesday, seeking immediate changes to security measures due to their ""unacceptable restrictions"" on free speech.Presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump is expected to officially become the Republican Party's candidate for president at the July 18-21 convention, which will attract protesters for various causes who plan to demonstrate outside.Trump campaign events have drawn large and raucous demonstrations, some of which have resulted in clashes between the candidate's supporters and opponents.Led by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the three groups filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, naming the city of Cleveland and Mayor Frank Jackson as defendants.
Dan Williams, a spokesman for the mayor, said in a phone call he had not seen the lawsuit and that the city does not comment on ongoing litigation. He said the city and the ACLU have discussed protester rights and regulations in meetings.    The plaintiffs are Citizens for Trump, a Texas-based group that supports the businessman's campaign; Organize Ohio, a liberal activist group; and Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless, a charitable organization.The lawsuit contends that Cleveland has imposed an unnecessarily large restricted zone of 3.3 square miles (8.5 square km) in the city center where free speech and mobility will be limited.
""The limitations apply far beyond the part of the city where the convention activities will take place. ... These regulations severely limit the opportunities for members of the public to exercise their expressive rights during the convention,"" the lawsuit said.The lawsuit seeks to reduce the size and regulations of the restricted an area and asks the court to immediately address the city's rules for issuing protest permits and what the ACLU called persistent delays in approving those permits. 
""Many of these applications have been pending for months - some as long as four months. The city's continuing refusal to approve or deny these applications leaves the organizers of these activities in limbo,"" the lawsuit said.Protesters need adequate time to make travel arrangements and rent needed materials such as portable toilets and sound stage equipment, the ACLU has said.

WASHINGTON Donald Trump will speak with House of Representatives Republicans on July 7 in what would be the first meeting of the party's presumptive presidential nominee with its entire House caucus, Republican aides said on Tuesday.House Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers announced plans for the meeting in a closed-door gathering of House Republicans on Tuesday, the aides said.Some House Republicans have publicly criticized Trump's inflammatory comments about Muslims, immigrants and women, saying they risked the party's chances of winning the Nov. 8 election.Speaker Paul Ryan, who has endorsed the real estate mogul, this month denounced the candidate's criticism of a Mexican-American judge as textbook racism.
On Tuesday, Ryan said banning Muslims from entering the United States is not in the nation's interest, in contrast to Trump's call to limit Muslim immigration.At the meeting with Trump, members will have a chance to ""share their policy priorities, learn about his plans to unite the party; and get details about his plans to move America forward,"" McMorris Rodgers said, according to an aide.
During his previous visits to Washington, Trump has met with House Republican leaders and a number of lawmakers who support him but not with all members of the caucus.
A Senate Republican aide said there were no schedules yet for Trump to meet with Republican senators. (Reporting by Susan Cornwell; Writing by Mohammad Zargham; Editing by Bill Trott)"	['Paul', 'Trump', 'Rodgers']	[]

| FORT PIERCE, Fla.

FORT PIERCE, Fla. The photo from Omar Mateen's high school yearbook is hardly remarkable - a toothy, dimpled smile with a peach-fuzz mustache below a mop of black hair. His transformation from high school football player to perpetrator of America's worst mass shooting raises questions about whether red flags were missed over the depth of his apparent sympathies with Muslim extremists.As families of the victims grieved and the nation recoiled at the scale of yet another mass shooting, a picture began to emerge of the 29-year-old killer as a quiet, devout person who in recent years displayed a hateful and violent streak.Early on Sunday, he stormed a packed gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, with a handgun and AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, fatally shooting 50 people before police killed him. Fifty-three others were wounded, many critically.His ex-wife, Sitora Yusufiy, described him as ""bipolar,"" and emotionally disturbed with a violent temper. She said she had been beaten and otherwise physically abused by Mateen during outbursts in which he would ""express hatred towards everything"". She was ""rescued"" by family members just four months into a stormy marriage that began in 2009 and ended in divorce, she said.""He would often get into fights with his parents, but as I was the only one in his life most of the violence was directed towards me,"" she told reporters in Boulder, Colorado outside a home where she was staying. She said he aspired to be a police officer and had worked as a correctional officer at a detention center for juvenile delinquents in Fort Pierce, Florida, and had once sought admission to a police academy.In Fort Pierce on Florida's southeast coast, 120 miles (195 km) from the shooting, the imam at the mosque that Mateen attended for nearly 10 years described him as a regular worshipper who was quiet and rarely interacted with the congregation.""He hardly had any friends,"" Syed Shafeeq Rahman, who heads the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce, told Reuters. ""He would come with his little son at night to pray and after he would leave.""Rahman said Mateen never approached him regarding any concerns about homosexuals. He usually prayed at the mosque a few times a week, mostly in evenings and as recently as Friday, but he didn't display signs of radicalism, according to fellow worshippers interviewed by Reuters.Mateen was born in New York of Afghan descent but spent most of his life in Florida, attending Martin County High School in Stuart, a small city about a 20-minute drive from the Fort Pierce condominium where had most recently lived.A classmate described him as a typical teen who played football. A school yearbook image of Mateen was seen by Reuters.  Samuel King, who was one year ahead of Mateen, said the two often spoke after Mateen graduated in 2004. King waited tables at Ruby Tuesday's restaurant at Treasure Coast Square, a mall where Mateen worked at GNC, the nutrition store, he said.King, who is openly gay, said the Mateen he knew until 2009 did not appear to be anti-homosexual.
""What is shocking to me is that the majority of the staff at Ruby Tuesday's when I worked there were gay. He clearly was not anti-(gay) at least not back then. He did not show any hatred to any of us.""While at GNC, Mateen lifted weights and ""got really buff,"" King said, describing Mateen as gregarious and talkative in the immediate years after high school. ""Something must have changed"" since he last saw him, he added.Mateen's father, Mir Seddique, told NBC News the massacre was not related to religion. He said his son turned angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami a couple of months ago. FBI INTERVIEWS
The FBI twice interviewed Mateen for having suspected ties to Islamist militants. The first investigation took place in 2013 when Mateen made inflammatory comments to co-workers that indicated sympathy for militants, FBI special agent in charge Ron Hopper told a news conference in Orlando.At the time, Mateen worked as a security guard at G4S, a British-owned multinational company that is among the world's largest private security firms. 
He joined G4S in September 2007, carried a gun as part of his duties and was employed with the company at the time of the shooting as an armed security officer, the company said. G4S provides security to federal buildings in Florida.Mateen was investigated and interviewed twice but the FBI was ""unable to verify the substance of his comments,"" Hopper said.Daniel Kime, a security guard employed along with Mateen by at G4S in the Fort Pierce area, said he met Mateen briefly three or four times. ""Every time I saw him he never smiled. If you said good morning, he'd just walk right by you, like he had a chip on his shoulder,"" Kime told Reuters.Daniel Gilroy, who said he was a co-worker of Mateen's at G4S, said that Mateen's anger was ""constant.""""Any time a female or a black person would come by he would use horrible words,"" he told Fox News. In 2014, Hopper said, Mateen was investigated and interviewed again, this time for suspected connections to Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, an American citizen who became a suicide bomber in Syria in 2014.
Hopper said Mateen's contact with Abu-Salha was minimal and it was deemed that ""he did not constitute a substantive threat at that time.""'NOT A STABLE PERSON'
Hopper said Mateen was not under investigation or surveillance at the time of Sunday's attack.He said Mateen called during the massacre to pledge allegiance to Islamic State, also known as ISIS, which in recent years declared a caliphate over large swathes of Iraq and Syria. But the depth of that commitment is unclear.Mateen also mentioned the Boston Marathon bombers during the call, which he made 20 minutes into the shootings, authorities said.Mateen's former wife said she met Mateen online about eight years ago and decided to move to Florida to marry him, according to the Washington Post.""He was not a stable person,"" she said. ""He beat me. He would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn't finished or something like that.""Mateen had a Florida firearms license that expired in 2013 and a state permit to work as a security guard, according to public records. He was registered as a Democrat.City, state and federal officials were searching Mateen's apartment in the Woodlands condominium building in Fort Pierce and had told other residents to evacuate.(This story has been refiled to correct headine in June 12 story to remove 'worst') (Additional reporting by Tim Reid in Los Angeles, Yeganeh Torbati and John Walcott in Washington, Bernie Woodall in Detroit and Yara Bayoumy in Fort Pierce.; Writing by Jason Szep.; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Stuart Grudgings)"	['Reid', 'Woodall']	['gay']
