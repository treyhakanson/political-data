| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Six U.S. senators have urged President Barack Obama to prioritize cyber crime at this weekend's Group of 20 summit in China, in the wake of the theft of $81 million from Bangladesh's central bank, according to a letter obtained by Reuters.In the letter sent to the White House ahead of the Sept. 4-5 summit, Sherrod Brown, a senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, and five other Democratic senators say they want the U.S. president to press leaders from the world's 20 biggest economies to commit in joint communiques to a ""coordinated strategy to combat cyber-crime at critical financial institutions.""The letter, dated Monday, suggests that concern among U.S. lawmakers is growing over the February incident in which hackers breached Bangladesh Bank's systems and used the SWIFT banking network to request nearly $1 billion from an account held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Some of the dozens of orders were filled, with much of the lost $81 million disappearing into Philippines casinos - prompting months of international finger-pointing, an ongoing investigation, and several requests from members of Congress for answers from the Fed and from SWIFT, the secure messaging service that banks use to transfer money around the world.""Our financial institutions are connected in order to facilitate global commerce, but cyber criminals - whether independent or state-sponsored - imperil this international system in a way few threats have,"" the senators, headed by Gary Peters of Michigan, wrote in the letter to Obama.""We strongly urge you to work with your counterparts and prioritize this discussion at the G20 leaders level in September,"" it said of the summit to be held in Hangzhou, China, adding that ""executive leadership circles across the globe"" needed to pay more attention to the risks.A senator in the Philippines has said Chinese hackers were likely to have pulled off the Bangladesh Bank heist, citing a network of Chinese people involved in the routing of the stolen funds through Manila.Beijing has dismissed the suggestion.Copies of the letter from the U.S. senators were also sent to Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew.
OBAMA-XI TALKS
The other senators signing the letter were Mark Warner and Martin Heinrich, both members of the Senate's Select Committee on Intelligence; Kirsten Gillibrand and Debbie Stabenow, the ranking Democrat on the Senate's Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.The White House expects G20 members at the summit ""to affirm their commitment to cooperate to fight cybercrime and to enhance confidence and trust in the digital economy,"" a senior administration official said.
Asked generally about cyber security on Monday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at a press conference: ""I would anticipate that this issue more generally will be on the agenda"" when Obama meets Chinese President Xi Jinping, the G20 summit host, later this week. At a November summit, the G20 pledged not to conduct economically motivated cyber espionage, an agreement intended to reduce the estimated hundreds of billions of dollars worth of commercial trade secrets that are stolen by foreign governments seeking to benefit industry in their own countries. Since then, the Bangladesh Bank attack and others that have emerged are only some of the threats posed by cyber criminals, the senators wrote. World regulators should ""erect more robust defenses and collaborative systems to prevent and mitigate the impact of successful attacks,"" the letter said, noting that steps already taken by SWIFT are not enough.Bangladesh said it supported raising the issue at G20.""In most cases, cyber attacks and crimes take place from outside the country,"" said Zunaid Ahmed Palak, a junior government minister for information and communications technology. 
""So while addressing fast growing cyber attacks, there should be a coordinated approach involving global stakeholders."" The Fed and other U.S. regulators said in a letter last week they were focused on cyber risks and controls at banks in the wake of the Bangladesh incident, though they offered few specifics. Peters, a member of the Senate's Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, told Reuters he is considering requesting a committee hearing on the heist.""I am concerned about the response and what steps have been taken to make sure it doesn't happen again,"" he said in an interview. ""You just need more collaboration and sharing of information... because often times all these entities aren't talking to each other.""(This story has been refiled with full name of Bangladesh minister) (Reporting by Jonathan Spicer; Additional reporting by Roberta Rampton and Dustin Volz in Washington and Serajul Quadir in Dhaka; Editing by Bernard Orr, Leslie Adler and Raju Gopalakrishnan)"	['Gillibrand', 'Obama', 'Warner']	[]

By Amanda Becker
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Huma Abedin, one of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's top aides, said on Monday that she was separating from her husband, Anthony Weiner, after a sex scandal similar to an earlier incident that led him to resign from the U.S. Congress.""After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband,"" Huma Abedin said in a statement.  ""Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy,"" Abedin added.Abedin's announcement follows a New York Post report late Sunday that Weiner recently sent photos of his boxer-brief-clad genitals - one while he was in bed with their toddler son - via Twitter to another woman.
The photos were part of a months-long exchange between Weiner and the woman and many of the messages were sexual in nature, according to the Post report.Weiner resigned in June 2011 from Congress, where he represented a New York City district, followed a sexting scandal in which he accidentally posted an explicit photo of himself on his public Twitter timeline instead of via a direct message to a woman, as he had intended.When Weiner made a second unsuccessful run for New York City mayor, explicit photos surfaced in July 2013 that he had recently sent under the pseudonym ""Carlos Danger"" to a young woman in Indiana.
Weiner said he had undergone therapy after the first sexting scandal, according to media reports. In recent months, he has taken care of the couple's toddler son. Abedin often travels with the Clinton campaign.Clinton's Republican rival, Donald Trump, said in a statement, ""Huma is making a very wise decision. I know Anthony Weiner well, and she will be far better off without him.""
Abedin first worked for Clinton in the 1990s as an intern when Clinton was first lady. She was a personal aide to Clinton during her successful 2000 campaign for U.S. Senate. Abedin worked on Clinton's first, unsuccessful White House bid in 2008 and served as her deputy chief of staff at the U.S. State Department. She is now the vice chair of Clinton's presidential campaign. Weiner served in Congress, representing his district in New York City from 1999 to 2011. His first unsuccessful run for New York mayor was in 2005. (Reporting by Amanda Becker; Editing by Caren Bohan and Jonathan Oatis)"	['Clinton']	[]

By Dustin Volz and Jim Finkle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The Federal Bureau of Investigation has found breaches in Illinois and Arizona's voter registration databases and is urging states to increase computer security ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election, according to a U.S. official familiar with the probe.The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Monday that investigators were also seeking evidence of whether other states may have been targeted.The FBI warning in an Aug. 18 flash alert from the agency's Cyber Division did not identify the intruders or the two states targeted.Reuters obtained a copy of the document after Yahoo News first reported the story Monday.Accessing information in a voter database, much of which is publicly accessible, does not necessarily suggest an effort to manipulate the votes themselves. When registering, voters typically provide their names, home addresses, driver's license or identification numbers, and party affiliations. But U.S. intelligence officials have become increasingly worried that hackers sponsored by Russia or other countries may attempt to disrupt the presidential election. Officials and cyber security experts say recent breaches at the Democratic National Committee and elsewhere in the Democratic Party were likely carried out by people within the Russian government. Kremlin officials have denied that. 
An FBI spokeswoman would not comment on the alerts but said the agency ""routinely advises"" on ""various cyber threat indicators observed during the course of our investigations.""The intrusions come amid repeated unsubstantiated claims by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that the U.S. election system is ""rigged.""Trump has cited emails leaked from the DNC that indicated the party leadership favored Hillary Clinton over rival candidate Bernie Sanders as reason to cast doubt on the electoral process in general.
'LARGER ATTACK'?
David Kennedy, chief executive officer of information security consulting company TrustedSec, said the attacks referenced in the FBI alert appeared to be largely exploratory and not especially sophisticated.""It could be a precursor to a larger attack,"" he added.Citing a state election board official, Yahoo News said the Illinois voter registration system was shut down for 10 days in late July after hackers downloaded personal data on up to 200,000 voters.
State voter systems are often targeted by hackers, and 200,000 is a relatively small number compared to other recent incidents. An independent computer security researcher uncovered in December of last year a database on 191 million voters that was exposed on the open Internet due to an incorrect configuration.The Arizona attack was more limited and involved introducing malicious software into one state employee's computer, said Matt Roberts, communications director for the Arizona secretary of state's office. That office publicly reported a cyber incident in June after being contacted by the FBI, which led to it temporarily shutting down its election site to deal with the potential threat. Roberts said he was uncertain if the FBI advisory was in reference to that same June incident, during which investigators found no evidence of any data exfiltration. In that episode, the FBI told Arizona officials the hackers were believed to be Russian and described it as an ""eight out of 10"" on a threat severity scale, Roberts said.Arizona will hold Republican and Democratic primaries for congressional races on Tuesday.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. California would become the first U.S. state to require farmers to pay overtime to field workers and fruit pickers under a bill approved by the legislature on Monday and sent to Democratic Governor Jerry Brown for his approval.The bill, which passed on a mostly party-line vote, would phase in overtime pay for farmworkers from 2019 to 2022. Small farms that employ 25 or fewer workers would have an additional three years to phase in the pay.If signed into law by Brown, California, the largest U.S. agricultural producer, would the first state in the country to require farmers to pay overtime to laborers who work more than eight hours a day or 40 hours a week. The governor has not said if he will sign the measure.The bill is the culmination of decades of lobbying and pressure by the United Farmworkers Union.The Democratic-controlled legislature rejected a version of the same bill earlier this year, but supporters amended it to phase in the overtime rules more slowly.
Opponents said that requiring farmers to pay overtime could damage the state's agricultural economy, where workers toil up to 60 hours a week during the harvest season but can go for months without pay other times of the year.They predicted that farmers would be forced to cut workers' hours to just 40 hours a week to avoid having to pay time-and-a-half or double-time overtime.Supporters, mostly Democrats, said the issue was one of fairness to farmworkers, who are among the few U.S. hourly workers not paid overtime.
""For me, it is a vote about my conscience,"" said Democratic Assemblyman Eduardo Garcia. ""We will be improving the lives of people.""

5	5	http://reuters.com/article/us-eu-usa-ttip-europeancommission-idUSKCN114143	European Commission says 'ball still rolling' on trade deal with U.S.	"

BRUSSELS The European Union's executive said on Monday it had a unanimous mandate from the bloc's 28 members to finalize negotiations on a free trade deal with the United States, a day after Germany's economy minister said the talks had ""de facto failed"".Sigmar Gabriel of Germany, the EU's biggest economy, said on Sunday that negotiations over the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) had failed because Europe rejected some U.S. demands.Asked to comment on Gabriel's remarks, a European Commission spokesman said: ""The ball is still rolling"" on TTIP.""Although trade talks take time, the ball is rolling right now and the Commission is making steady progress in the ongoing TTIP negotiations,"" Margaritis Schinas told a news conference.The White House also disputed Gabriel's contention, saying it was still aiming to reach a deal by the end of the year. ""It's going to require the resolution of some pretty thorny negotiations, but the president and his team are committed to doing that,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters in Washington.In Berlin, Germany's leading industry associations were critical of Gabriel's remarks and urged the German government to show greater commitment to free trade deals.
The head of industry association BDI, Ulrich Grillo, said it was ""astonishing"" that Gabriel, who is also vice chancellor and head of the co-governing Social Democrats, had declared the TTIP talks a failure when negotiations were still going on.Top officials of other industry associations such as VDMA and the Auto Industry Association VDA also spoke out against Gabriel's comments, which highlighted growing divisions within Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition ahead of next year's elections.  Three years of negotiations have failed to resolve multiple differences, including over food and environmental safety, with critics saying the pact would hand too much power to big multinationals at the expense of consumers and workers.
Backers of a sweeping U.S.-EU free trade deal see it bringing economic gains on both sides of the Atlantic. EU trade ministers will discuss the issue in Bratislava on Sept. 22.Schinas said the Commission was still ready to finalize the deal by the end of the year but not at the expense of ""Europe's safety, health, social and data protection standards, or our cultural diversity"".
Commenting separately on Gabriel's remarks, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius said he believed arriving at a deal would benefit both the EU and the United States.""It would be better for all sides to agree,"" he said. ""Of course, not at an expense of our interests. We have to defend our interests, but we also have to negotiate and conclude this agreement. It would be a big boost for economies, jobs, trade.""Britain's June vote to leave the EU has further clouded the picture, although Schinas said Brussels was still negotiating on behalf of all 28 members of the bloc, including London.

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama will have a bilateral meeting with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan during the G20 summit in China next month and is likely to have at least an informal talk with Russia's Vladimir Putin, the White House said on Monday.  Obama wants to talk with Erdogan about events in Turkey after July's attempted coup, the military campaign against Islamic State, and how to promote stability in Syria, Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes told reporters. The White House said it opposes Turkey's push into areas in northern Syria controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, an opposition group the Obama administration supports, as it stands to erode the united front against Islamic State.  The Obama-Erdogan meeting is scheduled for Sunday.
It was not certain whether Obama would hold a formal meeting with the Russian president during the G20 summit of the world's biggest economies, which runs Sept 4-5. But the two leaders often speak on the margins of such summits, Rhodes said. ""We usually try to find an opportunity for the two leaders to try to spend some time together, usually to focus on Syria and Ukraine,"" Rhodes said. The United States is at odds with Russia over the eastern Ukraine conflict and Washington and Moscow have struggled to stop fighting in Syria's civil war.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said a meeting between Putin and Obama has not yet been coordinated, Russian RIA news agency reported. ""We are ready,"" RIA cited Peskov as saying. ""But there is no final agreement yet.""

DETROIT Three Congressional leaders on Monday asked top federal environmental and safety officials to extend by 60 days the public comment period on new vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards.The public and their advocates need more time, beyond the comment period that ends Sept. 26, to absorb more than 1,000 pages of a draft technical assessment report, the three said in a letter to the environmental and safety chiefs.A week ago, U.S. regulators denied a similar request for an extension by major automakers.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a July report that automakers have the technology to meet aggressive mandates to hike fuel efficiency, but improvements will not be as great as the Obama administration once forecast because buyers are switching to pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles from lighter cars.        
When the administration first outlined its goal of boosting average fleet fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon, regulators forecast that 67 percent of vehicles sold in 2025 would be cars.    Since then, gasoline prices have fallen and truck and SUV sales have surged.     
Regulators now estimate the fleet will average 50 to 52.6mpg in 2025.
The letter dated Monday was sent to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Administrator Mark Rosekind. It was signed by three members of the U.S. House of Representatives: Fred Upton, chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce; Ed Whitfield, chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Power; and Michael Burgess, chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade.

By Julia Edwards
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Department of Homeland Security will study whether to discontinue using privately run detention centers, which the Justice Department recently called unsafe, for migrants and shares of private prison operators fell on Monday after the news.Department Secretary Jeh Johnson said he directed his advisory council to evaluate whether the agency should continue to contract with private prison operators and make a recommendation by Nov. 30. Advocates for immigrants have accused the companies of withholding proper mental health and medical care from detainees to boost profits. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a division of DHS, currently uses detention facilities run by Corrections Corp of America (CXW.N) and The GEO Group (GEO.N). Corrections Corp of America's stock slid 9.4 percent and The GEO Group's stock fell 6 percent immediately after news of the review. Both stocks were rebounding later in the afternoon.Corrections Corp of America earned $689 million from ICE contracts since 2008, 12 percent of its revenue from state and federal contracts over that time, according to the website SmartProcure which tracks government contracts. The company currently manages a facility for Central American women and children in Dilley, Texas.The GEO Group runs a similar facility in Karnes City, Texas and has earned $1.18 billion from contracts with ICE since 2008, about 35 percent of its total revenue from government contracts, according SmartProcure data.
The GEO Group said in a statement, ""GEO's facilities under contract with ICE are highly rated and provide high-quality, cost-effective services in safe, secure, and humane residential environments pursuant to strict contractual requirements and the federal government's national standards,"" the statement said. Corrections Corp of America spokesman Steve Owen said,    ""We're proud of the quality and value of the services we provide and look forward to sharing that information.""       Immigration advocates and members of Congress have ramped up pressure on DHS to end its contracts with the private prison companies since the Justice Department announced on Aug. 18 it would do so. 
That was prompted by an inspector general's report that criticized the safety and effectiveness of private prisons. ""Rather than wait for a review and a report from a committee, the president should ensure that the phase-out of private prisons ... is extended to DHS operations immediately,"" said Greg Chen, advocacy director at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Senator Bernie Sanders, former Democratic presidential candidate, and Democratic Representative Raul Grijalva asked DHS in a letter last week to end the practice. 
A Department of Homeland Security official told Reuters on Aug. 19 that ICE needed private prison companies because they offer flexibility to quickly build facilities and adjust detention space as migration flows fluctuate. Both companies also contract with state and local prison systems, which make up about half of their revenue.A Reuters survey of 10 states with the largest contracts with private prison companies, including California and Texas, showed none had immediate plans to drop their contracts.

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to meet with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Sept. 6, and plans to touch on human rights as well as security concerns, the White House said on Monday.""We absolutely expect that the president will raise concerns about some of the recent statements from the president of the Philippines,"" White House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told a media briefing when asked whether inflammatory remarks by Duterte about women, journalists and others would be a topic of discussion.Rhodes said, however, that there were important security issues to cover as well, particularly tensions over navigation in the South China Sea. China has been incensed by a ruling against its claims in the South China Sea by an international court, a case initiated by Manila.
The expected meeting between Obama and Duterte would take place in Laos, where the two leaders will be attending a summit of leaders from Pacific Rim nations.
