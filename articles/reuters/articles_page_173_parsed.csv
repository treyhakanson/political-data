By David Morgan and Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. congressional Republicans on Tuesday resisted Democratic demands for a vote on gun-control measures and warned that some could face punishment for an unusual sit-in last month that tied up the House of Representatives for 25 hours.With Democrats already rejecting a Republican gun bill and warning of further protests, the Republican-controlled House appeared to be heading for renewed discord over gun restrictions following the June 12 mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.House Speaker Paul Ryan met for about 30 minutes on Tuesday with two Democrats who led the sit-in: Representatives John Lewis of Georgia and John Larson of Connecticut. The Democrats said they would ask Ryan for a vote on two Democratic-backed measures but left the meeting without speaking to reporters.""The path ahead ... will be discussed and determined by the majority in the coming days,"" Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said later in a statement.
The measures sought by Democrats would expand background checks for gun purchases and allow the government to block gun sales to suspected extremists without first getting a judge's approval.  Hours before the meeting, Ryan suggested a vote on the Democratic legislation was unlikely, telling a Milwaukee radio station: ""The last thing we are going to do is surrender the floor over to these kinds of tactics when we know it's going to compromise the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens.""
House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said separately that he and Ryan would meet this week with the chamber's top enforcement official to talk about reports that some Democrats at the June 22-23 sit-in engaged in ""intimidation"" while carrying out their protest.Ryan has announced that the House will vote this week on a measure intended to keep guns out of the hands of people the government suspects of involvement in violent extremism. But Democrats say the legislation is inadequate because authorities would have only three days to convince a judge that a gun sale should be blocked.
""Ninety-one people die each day from gun violence in this country and the best Speaker Ryan can muster is a meaningless bill,"" said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi aide Drew Hammill.Six people who said they lost family and loved ones to gun violence were arrested in the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, after a protest demanding Congress reject the Ryan measure and vote on the Democratic measures.

By Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Donald Trump is taking some of his potential vice presidential running mates out for a test drive this week, meeting in private and trotting them out in public as he seeks to make his choice before the Republican National Convention less than two weeks away. Republicans close to the campaign say Trump and his team are considering announcing his running mate pick next week ahead of the convention, to be held July 18-21 in Cleveland, to try to get maximum media buzz from the decision.As his aides vet the people on his short list, Trump is getting an up-close look at some of the candidates and talking about it publicly, dispensing with the usual tradition of keeping secret the process of choosing a running mate.Trump, who is to be formally nominated at the convention as the Republican candidate for the Nov. 8 election, met privately on Tuesday with one possible pick, U.S. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, at Trump Tower in New York. On Tuesday night, the two appeared together at a Trump rally in Raleigh, North Carolina.
Trump introduced Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as ""a great friend of mine, somebody respected by everybody."" Then it was Corker's turn. ""I've figured out the reason why you love him so much,"" the senator told the crowd. ""The reason you love him so much is because he loves you. He loves you and he wants the best for you.""     
On Wednesday, Trump is to be joined for an event in Cincinnati by Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives who is another possible pick by Trump for the No. 2 position. Gingrich has been a close Trump adviser and is well regarded at Trump Tower.On Monday, Trump met on Monday with U.S. Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, another candidate on his short list.
Others on Trump's running mate list include Indiana Governor Mike Pence, who Trump met with on Saturday, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin and U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. Christie, a former Trump rival for the Republican nomination, and Sessions are among Trump's earliest supporters in the party and closest advisers.

A federal judge on Tuesday blocked Kansas Governor Sam Brownback's efforts to remove Planned Parenthood, a U.S. women's healthcare and abortion provider, from a government health insurance program for the poor in the state.U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson issued the 54-page order for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, ruling the state could not cancel Medicaid provider agreements with Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri, or PPKM, and Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, or PPSLR.""It is uncontroverted that PPKM and PPSLR serve hundreds of underprivileged women in the State of Kansas,"" Robinson said in the order. ""It is in the public interest to allow these individuals to be treated by the qualified provider of their choice, and to have that provider reimbursed under Medicaid pending a trial on the merits in this case.""The Republican governor ordered state officials to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood and its affiliates through the state Medicaid program in January, saying the state would not fund an industry that disrespected life.A spokeswoman for Brownback said in a statement on Tuesday: ""The governor will continue the fight to make Kansas a pro-life state. We will review today's preliminary ruling and move forward with the litigation.""
The state sought to cut funding after the release of videos secretly recorded by an anti-abortion group that activists said showed that Planned Parenthood officials in some states had discussed the sale of aborted fetal tissue.Neither of the Planned Parenthood affiliates involved in the case participates in fetal tissue donation or sale, court records show.
""We are thrilled with the judge's ruling. We felt strongly that we were going into this on the right side of the law,"" said Laura McQuade, chief executive of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, formerly Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri.The two organizations, along with three of their patients who are on Medicaid, sued the state in May, arguing Brownback's order would break federal law and violate the U.S. Constitution.
Planned Parenthood has denied taking any illegal payments, calling the videos distortions of fetal-tissue donations. The organization has said it has received only reimbursements for its costs, which are legal under U.S. law.Planned Parenthood said in May that at least two dozen states had cut or tried to slash funding to its clinics since the mid-2015 release of the undercover videos.

By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton widened her lead over likely Republican nominee Donald Trump to 13 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday.The July 1-5 poll included responses gathered mostly over the holiday weekend, before the Federal Bureau of Investigation recommended on Tuesday that no criminal charges be filed against Clinton over her use of private email servers and what it called her ""extremely careless"" handling of classified information while she was U.S. secretary of state.The presumptive Democratic nominee led Trump, a New York businessman, by 9 percentage points in a previous Reuters/Ipsos poll that ran from June 27 to July 1.Tuesday's poll showed that 46 percent of likely voters supported Clinton, while 33 percent backed Trump. Twenty-two percent said they would not support either candidate for the  Nov. 8 election. 
Throughout the campaign, Clinton has been dogged by her use of a personal email server during her years as the nation's top diplomat. Over the past several months, she has handed over thousands of pages of emails to investigators and responded to a number of government inquiries. Clinton has repeatedly said she never sent or received classified documents on her private servers, yet the public appears distrustful of her, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. In early May, 63 percent of Americans, including 36 percent of Democrats, said they did not believe Clinton was ""honest and truthful.""But Clinton has led Trump most of the year among likely voters. Since mid-May, she has maintained a relatively consistent level of support among likely voters, while Trump's popularity has eroded as his campaign wrestled with a variety of issues. 
Republican leaders distanced themselves from Trump after he suggested a federal judge was biased because of his Hispanic heritage and after he doubled down on a pledge to block Muslims from entering the country. On Tuesday, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan criticized a tweet posted by Trump over the weekend that many deemed to be anti-Semitic.Trump's level of support among likely voters was about 10 points below what 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney received in early July 2012.
Among Clinton's supporters, nearly half said they were backing her because ""I don't want Donald Trump to win."" A further 39 percent said they ""agree with her positions,"" and about 13 percent said they ""like her personally."" The online national poll of 1,441 American adults had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.

By Jonathan Stempel

A divided federal appeals court on Tuesday gave the U.S. Department of Justice broad leeway to police password theft under a 1984 anti-hacking law, upholding the conviction of a former Korn/Ferry International executive for stealing confidential client data.The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said David Nosal violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in 2005 when he and two friends, who had also left Korn/Ferry, used an employee's password to access the recruiting firm's computers and obtain information to help start a new firm.Writing for a 2-1 majority, Circuit Judge Margaret McKeown said Nosal acted ""without authorization"" even though the employee, his former secretary, had voluntarily provided her password.The defendant had by then been working as an independent contractor for Korn/Ferry. Nosal and his friends had previously had their own log-in credentials revoked.Nosal's case has been closely watched by digital privacy groups worried that it could make it easier to prosecute people for ordinary password sharing, such as when a husband logs into his wife's Facebook account with her credentials and permission.
""The court is criminalizing conduct that ordinary Americans do every day online,"" Jamie Williams, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which supported overturning Nosal's conviction, said in an interview.Dennis Riordan, a lawyer for Nosal, said in a statement he will ask an 11-judge appeals court panel to review the decision.A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment.
Nosal had been appealing his April 2013 jury conviction and one-year prison sentence for violating the CFAA and for trade secret theft under the Economic Espionage Act.The appeals court on Tuesday upheld Nosal's conviction under the EEA. It also ordered a recalculation of his $827,983 of restitution to Korn/Ferry to reconsider the legal fee component.Circuit Judge Stephen Reinhardt dissented. He said the majority's reasoning could cover the sharing of passwords to devices such as smartphones, laptops and iPads, and transform ""millions of people who engage in this ubiquitous, useful, and generally harmless conduct into unwitting federal criminals.""
McKeown, however, said this approach ignored reality and could enable criminals to escape prosecution after they found obliging employees willing to ""willy-nilly give out passwords.""The appeals court had in April 2012 dismissed other counts accusing Nosal of CFAA violations.The case is U.S. v. Nosal, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-10037. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler and Bill Rigby)"	[]	[]
5	5	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-clinton-comey-factbox-idUSKCN0ZL2N9	Factbox: FBI vs. Clinton - Seven points of contention	"

FBI Director James Comey undercut some of the main arguments Hillary Clinton has made in defense of her use of an unauthorized private email system while she was U.S. secretary of state. The Federal Bureau of Investigation began investigating Clinton's email system after government watchdogs found that some of her messages contained classified government secrets last year.Comey is recommending that Clinton not face criminal charges. But in an unusual step, he used a news conference to give a public rebuttal on Tuesday of the defenses offered by Clinton over the last year. Here are seven times that Comey contradicts Clinton:ON RETURNING WORK EMAILS
Clinton said:Clinton said in March 2015 that she returned ""anything that could be possibly viewed as work related."" She later swore under oath that she returned all her work emails to the State Department in 2014, some 30,000 in all.Comey said:The FBI recovered ""several thousand"" work emails that were not returned to the State Department. Comey has ""reasonable confidence"" that there was no deliberate effort to withhold these messages.  ON CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
Clinton said:Clinton has repeatedly said she did not send or receive any classified information through her private email system, and that emails being released to the public that were now marked classified were being retroactively ""upgraded.""Comey said:The FBI found 110 emails in 52 email chains that contained information that was classified at the time the messages were sent. Eight of those chains contained Top Secret information, the highest level of government classification; another 36 chains contained Secret information, and eight contained confidential information.
ON CLASSIFICATION MARKINGS
Clinton said:Clinton has repeatedly said she did not send or receive any emails that were ""marked"" classified.Comey said:A ""very small number"" of emails were marked as containing classified information. ""But even if information is not marked 'classified' in an email, participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it,"" Comey said.ON SECURITY:
Clinton said:     
The ""security and integrity"" of the email system were taken seriously, and ""robust protections"" were put in place, according to her staff in March 2015.Comey said:The system was ""not even supported by full-time security staff, like those found at departments and agencies of the U.S. government, or even with a commercial service like Gmail.""ON HACKING
Clinton said:Clinton said there is no evidence there was ever a breach of her email system.Comey said: 
It would be unlikely to find ""direct evidence"" of Clinton's email system being hacked, but the FBI believes ""it is possible that hostile actors gained access."" ""Hostile actors"" also gained access to some people Clinton corresponded with on her email system.ON APPROACH TO GOVERNMENT SECRETS
Clinton said:""I'm certainly well aware of the classification requirements,"" Clinton said in March 2015.Comey said:Clinton and her colleagues were ""extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.""ON CONSEQUENCES
Clinton said:Clinton has maintained that her email system was allowed and that she did nothing wrong. She has also said it was a ""mistake"" and apologized for it.Comey said: There is no evidence that Clinton and her colleagues intended to break the law, but people who engage in similar activity are ""often subject to security or administrative sanctions.""

By Jeff Mason
| CHARLOTTE, N.C.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. After months on the sidelines, President Barack Obama joined Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail at a rally in North Carolina on Tuesday, telling voters he was ready to ""pass the baton"" to his former secretary of state.Obama took the microphone in Charlotte, chanting ""Hillary!"" and told the crowd there had never been a candidate as prepared to be president as Clinton, his rival in 2008 for the Democratic nomination.""I've run my last campaign, and I couldn't be prouder of the things we've done together, but I'm ready to pass the baton,"" Obama said, in what was likely to be the first of many trips this year on Clinton's behalf.""I know Hillary Clinton is going to take it, and I know she can run that race,"" he said.Obama was returning the favor after Clinton backed him in 2008's general election. This year, he waited while she battled U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination before endorsing Clinton last month once she became the party's presumptive nominee.In Charlotte, Clinton preceded Obama, saying, ""We're going to build on the vision for America that President Obama has always championed, a vision for a future where we do great things together.""The North Carolina trip came the same day that Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said the agency would not recommend that Clinton face criminal charges over her use of a personal email system while secretary of state.White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama did not get advance notice of Comey's announcement and said the president would not discuss the FBI's investigation with Clinton.
Clinton's campaign welcomed the end of a probe that had cast a cloud over her campaign, but Republicans seized on Comey's criticism of what he termed Clinton's ""extremely careless"" handling of emails. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, who was due to campaign in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Tuesday, criticized FBI recommendation, tweeting, ""As usual, bad judgment."" JOINT APPEARANCE DELAYED

The first joint campaign appearance by Obama and Clinton was initially planned for soon after she clinched the Democratic nomination. But it was postponed following the mass shooting on June 12 at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida.On Tuesday, Obama appeared at ease back on the campaign trail. He mocked Trump's promise to ""Make America Great Again,"" saying, ""America is really great.""And he sought to contrast Clinton's preparedness for the White House and passion for helping working families with Trump, a political neophyte he referred to at times as ""the other guy.""""Everybody can tweet, but nobody actually knows what it takes to do the job until you've sat behind the desk,"" he said, an apparent reference to the wealthy New York businessman's fondness for Twitter.
Clinton hopes to reclaim North Carolina for the Democrats in the Nov. 8 election. Obama won the state in the 2008 general election but lost it narrowly in his 2012 re-election.Obama's appearance with the former first lady closes a circle on a relationship that began cordially when the two were U.S. Senate colleagues, grew tense when they were presidential rivals in 2008, and became close when Clinton served in Obama's Cabinet during his first term.Clinton and her family have played a role in Obama's elections. Clinton and Obama appeared together in Unity, New Hampshire, following their divisive primary fight in 2008, and Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, gave a well-received speech at the 2012 Democratic convention.Obama has focused on what he touts as Clinton's strength of character, in hopes of shoring up support among voters who find her untrustworthy, a weakness Trump has sought to exploit.Clinton needs Obama to woo young and left-leaning voters who backed Sanders and who made up part of the president's voting coalition in 2008 and 2012. Clinton has also campaigned with high-profile liberal U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, and she will appear later this week with Vice President Joe Biden.Clinton and Obama traveled to North Carolina on the presidential plane Air Force One, which Trump characterized as a burden on taxpayers. A Clinton spokesman said the campaign would cover its portion of the travel costs.

By Yeganeh Torbati
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A resolution calling for Iran to release two U.S. citizens imprisoned there for months will be introduced on Wednesday by House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Ed Royce, a Republican, and Democratic Representative Gerry Connolly, their offices said.The resolution will call for Iran to immediately and unconditionally release businessman Siamak Namazi and his father, Baquer Namazi, 80, both of whom have dual citizenship. The text of the resolution was seen by Reuters.It will also call for U.S. President Barack Obama to undertake efforts to secure their release. Siamak Namazi was detained by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in October while visiting relatives and has been barred from leaving Iran since July 2015. His father was arrested in Tehran in February.
""Iran's continued wrongful jailing of Americans is very disturbing,"" Royce said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. ""Siamak and Baquer Namazi deserve to be free and with their families, and this resolution should push President Obama to step up efforts to bring them home.""The resolution ""encourages the President to utilize appropriate measures"" against Iran's government if the Namazis are not released, but it stops short of calling for economic sanctions, a specific request by a representative of the Namazi family, said one source familiar with the resolution who declined to be named.
Siamak Namazi has criticized sanctions against Iran, writing in a 2013 opinion piece in the New York Times that Western sanctions had blocked medicines from reaching the country. U.S. State Department spokesman Sam Werberg said the agency does not comment on resolutions before they have been formally introduced. He added, ""We are not aware of any charges against either Siamak or Baquer and we believe that both reported detentions are unjust."" 
Five American citizens were released from Iranian prisons in January as part of a prisoner swap with the United States. Iran has detained several other dual nationals since that swap, including Homa Hoodfar, a Canadian-Iranian woman, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian woman and project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, and Nazak Afshar, a French-Iranian woman.

WASHINGTON The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday it disagreed with FBI Director James Comey's assessment that the department as a whole has a lax attitude toward security compared to other U.S. government agencies.""We don't share the broad assessment made of our institution that there's a lax culture here when it comes to protecting classified information. We take it very, very seriously,"" State Department spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing.
His comments came after Comey announced some of the results of the FBI's yearlong investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was in office. Comey said the FBI found evidence of a general lack of care for classified information at the State Department.

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday sharply criticized Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's Twitter post depicting Democratic rival Hillary Clinton against a backdrop of cash and a Star of David, saying anti-Semitic images have ""no place in a presidential campaign.""""Candidates should know that,"" Ryan, the highest-ranking elected Republican, said in an interview with radio station WTMJ in Milwaukee, two days before Trump was due to meet House and Senate Republicans in Washington.""I really believe he's got to clean up the way his new media works,"" he said, in a reference to Trump's social media efforts. The presumptive Republican nominee has frequently used Twitter to skewer his opponents and push his proposals.The radio station posted audio from the interview on its website, and the Wisconsin congressman's office provided a transcript of the session.Ryan's comments came a day after Trump defended the tweet, saying he had not meant the six-pointed star to refer to the Star of David, which is a symbol of Judaism.
Rather, he said, the star could have referred to a sheriff's badge, which is shaped similarly except for small circles at the ends of each of its six points, or a ""plain star.""Republican leaders were criticized in the U.S. media for not speaking out forcefully against the image attacking Clinton, which appeared over the U.S. Independence Day holiday weekend.""If I had to stop everything and comment to a ridiculous tweet sent out by this (Trump) campaign, I'd have no time for anything else,"" said Ryan, who supports Trump but has repeatedly spoken out against Trump's rhetoric, including his criticism of a Mexican-American judge.
""My understanding is, this was done by staff not by he himself,"" Ryan said. ""But more importantly, they've got clean this thing up.""Trump is due to meet with House and Senate Republicans in Washington on Thursday. Ryan did not say whether the tweet was likely to come up. 
House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters that the meeting would mainly focus on the newly released Republican agenda, which addresses six types of issue from poverty to tax reform.""But members will be free to talk about all different angles, and ideas, and probably some people will give their opinions and ideas on how to run the campaign,"" McCarthy said.Asked about his comfort level with Trump, the California Republican replied: ""I always look for constant improvement.""
