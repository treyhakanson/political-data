ISLAMABAD U.S. Senator John McCain said on Sunday he would like relations between United States and Pakistan to improve as they have a common enemy in the Islamic State and other radical Islamist groups.Relations between Pakistan and United States have been frayed over the past decade, with U.S. officials frustrated by what they term Islamabad's unwillingness to act against Islamist groups such as the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network.Pakistan rejects harboring militants but says there are limits to how much it can do as it is already fighting multiple Islamist groups and is wary of ""blowback"" in the form of more terror attacks on its soil. McCain, visiting Pakistan as part of a U.S. delegation, said he had an ""excellent meeting"" with Pakistani foreign ministry officials.""We come back with a message that we have a common enemy in ISIS, radical Islam and terrorism, and we look forward to closer relations and resolving the differences we have,"" McCain told Pakistan's national PTV channel.Relations between United States and Pakistan were tested again in May by a U.S. drone strike that killed Afghan Taliban chief Mullah Akhtar Mansour on Pakistani soil. 
As part of the visit, McCain traveled to Miranshah, the capital of the restive North Waziristan region bordering Afghanistan. The region was effectively run Islamists by groups such as the Pakistani Taliban and the Haqqani network until the Pakistani military launched operations against them in 2014.""I was very impressed with the progress (on the ground),"" said McCain, who is the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
""I see us working together in confronting a common challenge - radical Islamic terrorism - and these kinds of meetings are very helpful to both those countries,"" McCain added.The Islamic State has struggled to gain a major foothold in Pakistan, analysts say, but officials worry the group may pose a threat in the future. Pakistan said the country's top foreign policy official Sartaj Aziz had briefed the U.S. delegation - which includes Senators Lindsey Graham, Benjamin Sasse and Joe Donnelly - about faltering peace talks to end the civil war in Afghanistan.
So far China, United States and Pakistan have struggled to persuade the Afghan Taliban to meaningfully embrace the talks.""No country had as much vital stakes in the success of these joint efforts, as Pakistan, (Aziz) remarked,"" Pakistan's foreign ministry said in a statement.

By Sharon Bernstein

SACRAMENTO, Calif. - There is no guarantee California will vote to legalize recreational marijuana in November, but political operative and father of four Daniel Conway has already staked his future on it.Conway left his job as chief of staff to Sacramento's celebrity mayor, former Phoenix Suns NBA basketball star Kevin Johnson, to help start the marijuana investment company Truth Enterprises.He is one of hundreds in the most populous U.S. state already pushing ahead with plans to enter a market experts say will be worth $4 billion by 2020.""I'm someone of an age and of a demographic that sees the legalization and normalization of marijuana as inevitable,"" said Conway, 35. ""This was a chance not just to build companies but to build an industry.""With a population of nearly 40 million people, and a thriving medical marijuana trade legalized 20 years ago, California already has the United States' largest legal marijuana market. Legalization of recreational pot would generate an estimated $1 billion in additional taxes per year.If voters in November approve a measure to legalize and tax marijuana that qualified last Tuesday for the ballot, California would be the fifth U.S. state - and by far the largest - to allow marijuana for recreational use, joining Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska, as well as the District of Columbia.A similar ballot initiative failed in California in 2010, but recent polls show strong support for legalization. The latest effort is backed by mainstream leaders including Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, who helped negotiate the regulations and taxes it would impose.
Eight other states, including Nevada and Maine, also have recreational or medical marijuana proposals headed for their 2016 ballots. California's sheer size as the world's 6th largest economy means a decision by its voters to legalize marijuana could accelerate the trend elsewhere.""I don't believe there will be any precedent in the United States that can compare to it except for maybe the Gold Rush,"" said Leslie Bocskor, whose Nevada-based private equity firm, Electrum Partners, advises and invests in marijuana-related businesses.The lure of wealth in an uncharted industry is so great that thousands of people are jostling for position, said Bocskor.
Since January, 115 new California companies have joined the National Cannabis Industry Association, bringing total membership in the state to 330, said Deputy Director Taylor West.New companies include cultivators, dispensaries, laboratories, law partnerships, accountants, software developers, insurers and more, she said.Their challenge is to set up an infrastructure for a business that is not yet legal. Conway and his business partner, General Hydroponics CEO Ross Haley, for example, recently purchased farmland in Northern California that they hope to use to grow marijuana but would not say where before the measure is passed.Newport Beach-based Terra Tech is trying to prepare for recreational sales while building a legal business within the state's medical marijuana marketplace, which has annual sales of $2.7 billion.
The company spent more than $800,000 designing and remodeling its Oakland dispensary to look more like a high-end lounge than a drab medical clinic, said CEO Derek Peterson. It also developed colorful packaging for its marijuana instead of dispensing it in prescription bottles.Despite such optimism, passage of the California measure is not certain. It is opposed by many of the same law enforcement and health care groups who helped defeat the 2010 initiative.But this time backers have the deep pockets of former Facebook president Sean Parker, support from Newsom - a Democrat expected to run for governor in 2018 - and a switch in attitude among voters who saw legalization come on line in other states.The measure would allow adults age 21 and older to possess up to one ounce of marijuana, cultivate up to six plants and sets rules for commercial cultivation, manufacture and sale. It includes rules aimed at keeping cannabis products from children, preventing impaired driving and requiring licenses for sellers.Newsom said he is backing it as a way to responsibly manage legalization, which he views as inevitable but necessary to handle carefully.""As a guy with four kids, who doesn't like the drug, doesn't like the smell, doesn't want my kids to think it's normalized, this is my number one concern,"" Newsom said."

By Emily Flitter
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK The Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for three and a half hours on Saturday as part of the probe into her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state, her campaign said.The interview at FBI headquarters in Washington followed a week of intense public focus on the investigation and on  Clinton's viability as a presidential candidate, with four months to go to the election. Her campaign has tried for months to downplay the controversy as a distraction.  In an interview broadcast on MSNBC, Clinton said she was happy to do the FBI interview, which her spokesman earlier described as ""voluntary."" ""I've been answering questions for over a year"" regarding the private email server, Clinton said.It was not clear if the questioning of Clinton signaled an imminent conclusion to the investigation in a pivotal time for the presidential race. It does follow FBI interviews of several of Clinton's former staff members, as well as her top aide Huma Abedin. Clinton is expected to be formally nominated as the Democratic candidate for the Nov. 8 presidential election at the party's convention in less than four weeks. ""Timing of FBI interview, between primaries and convention, probably good timing for @HillaryClinton,"" tweeted David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama who served as the chief strategist for his two presidential campaigns. ""Best to get it behind her.""Clinton is currently the front-runner for the White House with polls showing her leading presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.
In a tweet on Saturday, Trump said it was ""impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong!""  He also criticized Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, for meeting privately with Attorney General Loretta Lynch earlier this week, which Lynch later said she regretted, though she said they did not discuss the investigation. ""What Bill did was stupid!"" Trump tweeted.The FBI is investigating whether anyone in Clinton's operation broke the law as result of a personal email server kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. One of the questions is whether they mishandled classified information on the server.  
Clinton and her staff have struggled to respond to accusations that her use of the server in violation of State Department protocol means she is untrustworthy. Trump has said the investigation should disqualify her from being president.""@HillaryClinton campaign statement says She ""voluntarily"" met w @FBI for 3.5 hours this morning - yeah, lots of people volunteer 2 do that,"" tweeted the Republican National Committee's communications director, Sean Spicer.WEEK OF TENSIONS 

FBI Director James Comey said in testimony to Congress in March he felt pressure to complete the investigation quickly. Adding to the uncertainty over Clinton is the FBI's refusal to say who is the target of its investigation.Republican lawmakers have called for an independent investigation, saying they do not trust the Justice Department to handle the inquiry with impartiality. Republicans, including Trump, intensified their criticism of the process on Thursday after news emerged of Lynch's meeting with Bill Clinton. Lynch said she would accept whatever recommendations the career prosecutors working on the case made about whether to prosecute Clinton.The FBI probe and the partisan fight over the server have added an extra layer of uncertainty to one of the most tumultuous presidential races in recent memory. Trump, a political novice once dismissed by the Republican establishment, will likely emerge this month as the party's nominee and has set his sights on Clinton, who he has labeled ""Crooked Hillary."" Clinton held a nine-point lead over Trump in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday. (Editing by Mary Milliken)"	['Trump', 'Clinton', 'Lynch', 'Obama']	[]

By Emily Flitter
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Saturday tweeted an image of rival Hillary Clinton alongside hundred-dollar bills and a Jewish star bearing the words ""most corrupt candidate ever!"", prompting outrage and bafflement on social media.  Two hours after his initial tweet, Trump tweeted a similar image in which the six-pointed Star of David - which appears on Israel's flag and which Jews were forced to wear on their clothing by the Nazis during the Holocaust - was replaced by a circle. The original tweet was deleted.Critics said the image featuring the star harkened back to centuries-old anti-Semitic stereotypes, such as the belief that Jews are greedy.
""Just saw #DonaldTrump's Star of David tweet. I'm impressed by his ability to find a way to insult literally every kind of human being,"" screenwriter Cole Haddon wrote on Twitter.""A Star of David, a pile of cash, and suggestions of corruption. Donald Trump again plays to the white supremacists,"" wrote Erick Erickson, a conservative radio host who has been critical of Trump.
The tweets originated from Trump's account, @realDonaldTrump, and no other users were mentioned in them. It was not clear whether someone inside Trump's campaign made the image or whether he found it somewhere else. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, did not respond to a request for comment.The presumptive Republican nominee has been trying to assuage fears within his own party that he is alienating potential voters with offensive statements about Muslims, Latinos and women. Last month, Trump fired his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and began delivering speeches using a teleprompter, an abrupt change in style that was seen as an attempt to appear more presidential ahead of the Nov. 8 election.
Saturday's tweet was a reminder of the unrestrained side of Trump. The candidate has mocked a disabled newspaper reporter, referred to undocumented immigrants from Mexico as ""rapists"" and recently pointed to a black man in the crowd at one of his rallies and called him ""my African-American.""

By Alex Dobuzinskis

North Carolina lawmakers adjourned for the year on Friday night after leaving mostly intact a law restricting transgender bathroom access that has drawn condemnation and jeopardized the state's efforts to host the NBA All-Star Game, officials said.The law passed in March made North Carolina the first U.S. state to require transgender people to use restrooms in public buildings and schools that match the sex on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity.The National Basketball Association has said it could move its All-Star Game out of Charlotte, North Carolina, and has cited concerns over the law's effects on principles of inclusion and equal protection that league officials say they uphold.  A spokesman for the NBA could not immediately be reached for comment.North Carolina state Representative Chris Sgro, a Democrat who opposes the law, which is known as House Bill 2, said he had hoped lawmakers would vote on Friday on whether to repeal it. But they adjourned for the year without holding that vote, he said.
""It probably means that we're going to have to come back for a special session because we're going to lose the All-Star Game if we don't,"" Sgro, who is executive director of the gay rights group Equality North Carolina, said in a phone interview.The NBA All-Star Game is scheduled for February 2017.President Barack Obama, business leaders, entertainers and some prominent politicians have criticized House Bill 2, saying it is unfair to transgender people.
State lawmakers on Friday addressed one point of controversy over House Bill 2 by restoring the right to sue for wrongful termination in state court on allegations of discrimination based on age, sex, race or other factors, officials said. House Bill 2 had removed that right and required such suits to be filed in federal court.The office of Senate Leader Phil Berger, a Republican, said in a statement the change addressed concerns from the state's governor and others. 
But Berger expressed continued support for House Bill 2.   ""Protecting the safety and privacy of North Carolina families by keeping grown men out of bathrooms, shower facilities and changing rooms with women and young girls has always been our primary objective,"" Berger said in a statement. On Thursday, an NBA statement said no final decision had yet been made regarding the All-Star Game. (Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles; Editing by Nick Macfie)"	[]	['gay']

By Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie top Donald Trump's short list to be his vice presidential running mate, sources said, but the candidate is casting a wide net that also includes several U.S. senators and other governors.With less than three weeks to go until his formal nomination at the Republican National Convention as the party's candidate in the Nov. 8 election, Trump's search for a No. 2 has intensified. The wealthy businessman, a political neophyte, has said he wants a political veteran to help him navigate the power corridors of Washington.Gingrich and Christie, both loyal to Trump at a time when many Republican colleagues want nothing to do with him, would meet his requirement for experience - but would come with minuses as well as pluses.Other names to watch include U.S. Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee, Joni Ernst of Iowa and Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Governors Mike Pence of Indiana and Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, Republicans close to the campaign said this week.    Trump has set up a meeting with Pence this weekend, a spokesman for the governor said on Friday. The New Yorker has also met with Corker and Fallin.""Mr. Trump is meeting with a number of Republican leaders in the run-up to the convention in Cleveland, and he has a good relationship with Gov. Pence,"" Trump spokesman Jason Miller said in an email response to a question from Reuters.An experienced running mate also could help with fundraising. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, raised more than $40 million for her campaign in June and about $28 million for her party. Trump, who largely self-funded his primary run, has not yet released June fundraising numbers. Trump is expected to name his running mate close to the July 18-21 convention. RUNNING MATE PROSPECTS

Gingrich, who was speaker of the House of Representatives in the 1990s and ran for president in 2012, is a popular conservative writer and speaker, and has been an important behind-the-scenes voice in urging Trump to adopt a more presidential demeanor.But because Trump is 70 and Gingrich is 73, they could face difficulty appealing to a younger generation.Christie quickly endorsed Trump after quitting the race early this year. A source said the 53-year-old governor has emerged as a key adviser to Trump and his campaign team. A source said Christie was instrumental in coaxing Trump to be less confrontational with a Mexican-American federal judge overseeing a fraud case involving Trump.One clue to Christie's rising importance came earlier this week when some campaign supporters held a conference call to discuss strategy and talking points for media appearances.A source said that during the call Christie's name was raised as someone who might comment on former President Bill Clinton's meeting earlier this week with Attorney General Loretta Lynch. As a former federal prosecutor, Christie would be a credible voice. 
Monday night's private meeting of Clinton and Lynch, the top U.S. law enforcement officer, has been criticized because Hillary Clinton is under federal investigation for using a private email server when she was Democratic President Barack Obama's secretary of state.The source said campaign associates made clear Christie was not to be used for this purpose.""They're saving him for the general election,"" the source said. ""They don't want to overexpose him.""Still, many Republicans are waiting to see whether Christie is named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a 2014 case involving charges that lanes on the George Washington Bridge were closed in New Jersey for political reasons.
Corker, 63, offers Trump deep foreign policy experience as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and, like Trump, believes the Republican Party needs shaking up. His stock may have gone down, however, because he has not hesitated to criticize the candidate at times.Ernst, a first-term senator and military veteran, could help improve Trump's standing with women. She tacitly supported rival Marco Rubio during the Republican nominating campaign, though she has promised to support the party's nominee.Ernst, who turned 46 on Friday, said earlier this month that the Trump campaign had not contacted her.The same goes for Oklahoma's Fallin, who was among several Republican governors who met jointly with Trump in June.""It's an honor to be mentioned for the office of vice president. I have not had any conversation with Mr. Trump about the vice presidency,"" Fallin, 61, said in a statement.Some Republicans could be considered even if they have not had recent contact with the campaign. Alice Stewart, a former spokeswoman for U.S. Senator Ted Cruz's presidential campaign, said the Texan's running mate, Carly Fiorina, was only told late in the vetting that she might be picked.Trump's vetting is being conducted by Washington lawyer A.B. Culvahouse, a longtime fixture in national Republican politics.

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday introduced a measure intended to prevent gun sales to people on government watch lists, only to draw demands from Democrats for stronger proposals and a warning of possible new protests.A week after Democrats ended a 25-hour sit-in on the House floor to call for gun legislation after the June 12 mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, said lawmakers will vote next week on a measure giving government authorities three days to convince a judge that someone on a terrorism watch list should not be allowed to obtain a firearm.""It is a responsible measure that confronts this threat while protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement.But in a Friday conference call, House Democrats reached ""a clear consensus"" to oppose the measure, calling it the handiwork of the National Rifle Association, an aide said. Similar legislation, backed by the NRA, was blocked by Democrats in the Senate last week. Democrats also called for two amendments: one to allow the U.S. attorney general to decide without court approval whether someone on a watch list could buy a gun and another to expand existing background checks to all commercial gun sales including those at guns shows.
Democratic Representatives John Lewis of Georgia and John Larson of Connecticut, who led last week's sit-in, asked for a meeting with Ryan to request votes on the amendments, which consist of legislation originally sponsored by Republican Peter King of New York. Ryan agreed to meet with the Democrats next Tuesday, Republican and Democratic aides said.""If these amendments are not allowed, then members will have further discussions about possible actions to take in response to this refusal to allow a vote on commonsense gun legislation,"" said another House Democratic aide.AshLee Strong, a Ryan spokeswoman, said the House speaker ""looks forward to meeting with Congressmen Lewis and Larson to discuss the important action the House will take to prevent terrorist attacks.""
The new Republican proposal, which would apply to anyone who has been suspected of violent extremism within the past five years, would require authorities to show probable cause that a would-be buyer ""will commit an act of terrorism"" or violates existing prohibitions on undocumented immigrants, fugitives, convicts and people with mental illness.The gun provisions were tucked into a bill aimed at stepping up efforts against terrorism, including what the legislation referred to as ""radical Islamist terrorism.""
Some Republicans have criticized Democrats for avoiding such terms to describe events like the Orlando shooting, where a gunman pledging allegiance to Islamic State killed 49 people last month.Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said recently that President Barack Obama should resign for not having used ""radical Islam"" in a statement responding to the Orlando massacre, in which police identified the shooter as a U.S. citizen born in New York to Afghan immigrants.The NRA said it was reviewing the legislation, while the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence said the legislation proposed by House Republicans was a publicity stunt.

By Justin Madden
| CHICAGO

CHICAGO With murders and shootings soaring in Chicago this year, the city's police chief and state lawmakers announced on Friday they will push for new laws setting harsher sentences for repeat offenders of gun crimes in Illinois.The law, which would be known as the Violent Gun Offenders Sentencing Act, is in its infant stages and would provide presumptive guidelines that judges would have to follow when ordering repeat criminals to serve jail time. Judges would be required to implement penalties on the higher range of existing sentencing laws.""Part of the goal is to incapacitate, get these violent offenders off the street,"" state Senator Kwame Raoul said at a news conference announcing the proposed legislation.Raoul said he would sponsor the legislation along with Senator Antonio Munoz and Representative Michael Zalewski, all Democrats. 
Chicago, the third-largest U.S. city, has had 307 murders so far this year, up 50 percent from the same period last year, and 1,548 shootings, up 52 percent from the same period last year, according to police statistics.Police have blamed the violence largely on gangs and a proliferation of stolen guns. There were nearly 500 homicides last year, and gun violence is up in 2016, police say.
More than 50 people involved in shootings and murders in Chicago this year would have been in prison at the time of the incident if the proposed tougher sentencing policies were in place, the police department said in a statement on Friday.Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the law is not designed to penalize responsible gun owners, but focus on the individuals ""who tell us 'I don't care.'""
Legislators in the state capital, Springfield, have frequently rejected gun control measures proposed by lawmakers from Chicago.A proposal made in 2013 by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to impose tougher sanctions for illegal gun possession did not get through the state Assembly because of opposition from black lawmakers who said it could lead to higher incarceration rates for blacks in Chicago communities already struggling with high numbers of former inmates who cannot find jobs.

By Hilary Russ

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie ordered a halt to non-essential road, bridge and mass transit projects late Thursday after lawmakers failed to reauthorize the state fund that pays for them.Christie's executive order calls for the state Department of Transportation and New Jersey Transit to devise a plan before midnight Saturday for the ""orderly"" shutdown of projects funded by the Transportation Trust Fund.Federally funded projects will continue, Christie said in his executive order. The state expects to receive an estimated $906 million of federal transportation aid, according to the state treasurer's annual report.New Jersey's ability to borrow for new transportation projects ran out on Friday, the start of the new fiscal year. The trust fund already has about $16 billion of outstanding debt for existing road projects.The fund has roughly $80 million left, said Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman John Wisniewski, who called Christie's executive order ""pure theater.""        
Without new appropriations or bond proceeds, the authority cannot pay vendors for construction. Projects at any stage - procurement, design and construction - are affected by Christie's order, the Department of Transportation said.About a month ago, lawmakers discussed issuing grant anticipation revenue bonds, or so-called GARVEEs, as a stop-gap measure, but the idea was never acted upon, Wisniewski told Reuters.The flow of federal money backing those bonds is often uncertain from year to year.""You can't do an annual capital program on GARVEE bonds,"" he said.
Christie ordered the remaining money in the fund to be held only for the most essential projects ""in order to protect the health, safety and welfare"" of New Jerseyans, he said.Christie had hatched a late-night deal earlier this week with the Assembly to raise the state gasoline tax by 23 cents to 37.5 cents per gallon to replenish the fund.In exchange, the sales tax rate would shrink 1 percentage point to 6 percent, which could lead to an annual $1.7 billion shortfall in future budgets.
But the Senate ended its session on Thursday without replenishing the program, which is expected to run out of money in August. Senators were pushing their own bill, which would have phased out the estate tax on wealthy residents instead of reducing sales taxes.Christie also stripped several items out of the legislature's budget on Thursday, signing a reduced $34.5 billion budget for fiscal 2017 that is just 2.1 percent higher than that for fiscal 2016.
