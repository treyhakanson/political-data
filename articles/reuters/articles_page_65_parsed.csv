U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump are in a tight race ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Following is a weekly roundup of financial market analysts' views on the U.S. elections and the likely implications of a Trump or Clinton win on financial markets.  MORE COVERAGE: bit.ly/2dOgcoESEE RELATED FACTBOX: reut.rs/2d9cl4qDAVID KOSTIN, U.S. PORTFOLIO STRATEGY RESEARCH, GOLDMAN SACHS
""A so-called 'wave election' would occur if one party registers large congressional seat gains and has the potential to implement policy changes... Following six prior 'wave elections,' S&P 500 typically fell during the subsequent 1 and 3 months. Our strategies: buy health care equipment and services/sell pharma and biotech; own firms with high government sales; (and) own high overseas cash.""CHRIS SENYEK, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, WOLFE RESEARCH
""Whether it's Hillary or Trump, the U.S. is unlikely to break out of secular stagnation. With respect to the election, our focus will remain on the impact that the next U.S. president will likely have on fiscal and monetary policies, as well as the global growth outlook. Unfortunately, we don't see either candidate as likely to purse a true 'pro-growth' agenda that will break the U.S. economy out of its current malaise.""  Interest rates: ""We see rising upside risk for longer-term U.S. rates, regardless of the outcome in November. The biggest upside risk for a sustained increase in longer-term rates is rising risk premiums.""Credit growth: ""With Trump's negative comments regarding Dodd-Frank, our sense is a Trump victory could jumpstart lending. We believe a Hillary win would create even stiffer headwinds and more regulation for the financial services industry.""Sector recommendations:
- Buy on Clinton win, sell on Trump win: alternative energy, housing and REITs, hospitals and managed care, exporters and companies with international exposure - Buy on Trump win, sell on Clinton win: exploration and production, banks, big pharma and biotechnology, high tax rate companies- Potential upside in either scenario: infrastructure companies, cash repatriation companies, defense, gun manufacturers ANDREW SHEETS, STRATEGIST, MORGAN STANLEY
Infrastructure spending: ""In a rare example of bipartisan support, both candidates have discussed the need to repair crumbling infrastructure... The correlation between infrastructure spending and equity returns has deteriorated in recent years, but candidates' outsized plans could still be a tailwind for infrastructure-levered stocks."" Names ""overweight""-rated Eaton Corp and ""equal-weight""-rated Pentair preferred plays, given both companies' leverage to infrastructure investments and attractive relative valuation. 
Utilities and clean energy sector: ""Hillary Clinton has been an outspoken advocate of renewable energy and improving resiliency of the electric grid, while Donald Trump has made numerous statements in support of fossil fuels. We see a Trump presidency as largely maintaining the current level of utility infrastructure spend, while a Clinton presidency could result in meaningful upside, particularly in clean energy. Thus, from the standpoint of long-term growth, we see a positive risk/reward for utilities going into the election.""       TONY DWYER, EQUITY STRATEGIST, CANACCORD GENUITY
Market moves: ""In this presidential election, there is no social mandate coming from economic dislocation, nor a likelihood of any party receiving a super majority that would cause major legislative change. As a result, any election-based (market) movement - before and after - should prove temporary. Clearly, there is a lot of rhetoric, but that does not equal legislative success.""SEAN DARBY, CHIEF GLOBAL EQUITY STRATEGISTS, JEFFERIES

Global markets: ""We analyzed equity returns before and after the U.S. election. The Hang Seng tends to do well one month before the election and then performs till the end of the year. The Nikkei 225 tends to do well one month afterwards. Interestingly, the VIX consistently rises one and three months before the election while the dollar tends to strengthen. Bonds tend to do better after the election result going into the year-end.""ROB MARTIN, SENIOR U.S. ECONOMIST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL
Clinton win: ""If elected, we believe that Hillary Clinton would push for expanded trade deals, including a revised or modified TPP-like agreement, albeit these deals would likely include increased protections for US workers, as well as expanded provisions for trade adjustment assistance.""   Trump win: ""Donald Trump, if elected, is likely to actively oppose any expansion of trade, and he plans to withdraw from TPP, direct the Secretary of Commerce and Treasury to identify violations of trade agreements and unfair trade practices, renegotiate NAFTA, and 'use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes'.""

By Emily Stephenson and Alana Wise
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump dug deeper in his efforts to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the U.S. election, saying on Twitter on Sunday that he believed the results were being ""rigged"" at many polling places. His tweet came hours after his vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, said Republicans would accept the outcome of the Nov. 8 contest between Trump and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.""The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD,"" Trump wrote on Twitter, in the latest of a series of comments he has made over the past several days calling into question the fairness of the election.Trump, who is trailing Clinton in opinion polls, did not provide any evidence to back his allegations of impropriety at the voting booth. Early voting and voting by mail have begun in many states.In another tweet later on Sunday, Trump blamed ""animals representing Hillary Clinton"" and Democrats in North Carolina for an overnight attack on a local Republican Party headquarters in that state.Local authorities said the building in Hillsborough, North Carolina, had been struck through a front window with flammable material and an adjacent building wall was spray-painted with a swastika and the words ""Nazi Republicans leave town or else.""""Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning,"" Trump tweeted.Clinton denounced the attack as ""horrific and unacceptable"" in her own tweet, adding: ""Very grateful that everyone is safe.
'COORDINATED EFFORT'
Trump, a New York businessman, who has never held elective office, has often said the electoral process is skewed against him, including during the Republican nominating contests, when he disputed the method for winning delegates to the Republican National Convention.His latest complaint of media bias stems from allegations by women that he groped them or made other unwanted sexual advances, after a 2005 video became public in which Trump was recorded bragging about such behavior. He apologized for the video but has denied each of the accusations.""Election is being rigged by the media, in a coordinated effort with the Clinton campaign, by putting stories that never happened into news!"" Trump tweeted on Sunday, a sentiment he also expressed in posts and during rallies in Maine and New Hampshire on Saturday. The comments raised questions both from  Republicans and Democrats about whether he would accept the outcome should he lose to Clinton.Trump said after the first presidential debate in September that he would ""absolutely"" accept the election outcome. But a few days afterward, he told the New York Times: ""We're going to see what happens."" 
He has also urged his supporters to keep an eye on voting locations to prevent a ""stolen"" election, which some critics interpreted as encouraging them to intimidate voters.Pence said on Sunday he and Trump would respect the will of the voters.""We'll respect the outcome of this election,"" said Pence, the Indiana governor. ""Donald Trump said in the first debate that we'll respect the will of the American people in this election. The peaceful transfer of power is a hallmark of American history.""In a weekend statement quoted by media, a spokeswoman for U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican, said: ""Our democracy relies on confidence in election results, and the speaker is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity."" 
'CONSEQUENCES TO RUSSIA'
On Sunday, Pence for the second time in recent weeks broke from Trump on Russia, this time on that country's possible involvement in email hacks tied to the U.S. election, saying Moscow should face ""severe consequences"" if it has compromised U.S. email security. ""I think there's no question that the evidence continues to point in that direction,"" Pence said. ""There should be severe consequences to Russia or any sovereign nation that is compromising the privacy or the security of the United States of America,"" Pence said on ""Fox News Sunday.""Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week his country was not involved in trying to influence the U.S. election.Trump, who has been criticized for appearing too close to Russia after he publicly praised Putin's governing style, has questioned the reports of Moscow's involvement. ""Maybe there is no hacking,"" he said during last week's second debate with Clinton.Trump also contradicted Pence on Russia during that debate. Pence had said the United States should use military force in Syria if Russia continued air strikes to prop up President Bashar al-Assad, but Trump said he disagreed.The third and final debate between Trump and Clinton will be on Wednesday in Las Vegas.

By Steve Holland and Dan Whitcomb
| CHARLOTTE, N.C./LOS ANGELES

CHARLOTTE, N.C./LOS ANGELES Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump on Friday charged that the women accusing him of sexual misconduct fabricated their stories to damage his campaign after two more women came forward with allegations that he had groped them.The new accusations were made by a contestant on his reality TV show ""The Apprentice,"" who cited a 2007 incident, and by a woman who described an incident from the early 1990s.With the allegations against Trump dominating the campaign, opinion polls show Trump trailing Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll taken Oct. 7-13 and released on Friday showed Trump behind Clinton by 7 percentage points among likely voters in the Nov. 8 election.Trump has spent more and more time at his rallies denying allegations of groping since a video from 2005 became public a week ago showing him bragging about groping and making unwanted sexual advances. On Friday, in addition to his denials, he suggested that he never would have found two of the women who have made allegations attractive.Summer Zervos, who competed on the fifth season of ""The Apprentice"" in 2006, appeared at a news conference with celebrity attorney Gloria Allred in Los Angeles, saying Trump kissed her, touched her breast and tried to get her to lie down on a bed with him during a meeting about a possible job.""He put me in an embrace and I tried to push him away. I pushed his chest to put space between us and I said, 'Come on man, get real.' He repeated my words back to me, 'Get real,' as he began thrusting his genitals,"" Zervos said.Zervos said she thought Trump was going to take her to dinner to discuss a job, but the meeting took place in his bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel.""I wondered if the sexual behavior was some kind of test and whether or not I had passed"" by rejecting it, she said, but Trump later offered her a job at a golf course for half the salary she had requested.Trump released a statement denying her allegations.""I vaguely remember Ms. Zervos as one of the many contestants on 'The Apprentice' over the years. To be clear, I never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago,"" Trump said. ""That is not who I am as a person, and it is not how I've conducted my life.""At his last event of the day on Friday, in Charlotte, Trump suggested that his accusers were fabricating their stories for publicity or to damage his campaign. ""It's not hard to find a small handful of people willing to make false smears,"" he said. Trump said the women may be motivated for financial reasons or political reasons or ""the simple reason they want to stop our movement.""Earlier Friday, the Washington Post published an interview with a woman who said Trump put his hand up her skirt in a crowded New York nightclub in the early 1990s in an unwanted advance.
""He did touch my vagina through my underwear, absolutely,"" Kristin Anderson said in a video interview on the newspaper's website. ""It wasn't a sexual come-on. I don't know why he did it. It was like just to prove that he could do it,"" she told the newspaper. Anderson could not be reached for comment.Trump's White House campaign has been scrambling to recover from the release a week ago of the 2005 video. While Trump said the video was just talk and he had never behaved in that way, several women subsequently went public with allegations of sexual misconduct against the New York real estate magnate going back three decades.National opinion polls have shown that women voters have been fleeing Trump in large numbers, putting his campaign in free-fall.CAMPAIGN PROVIDES WITNESS
Late on Friday, the Trump campaign put forward a British man who disputed the account of one of the accusers, Jessica Leeds. Leeds, who is now 74, said Trump groped her on a flight to New York, in or around 1980. Her account was published in The New York Times earlier this week and she has since been interviewed on CNN.
The New York Post reported that the man, Anthony Gilberthorpe, contacted the Trump campaign after Leeds went public with her story, and said he was sitting near Leeds and Trump in first class on the same flight. ""I was there, I was in a position to know that what she said was wrong, wrong, wrong,"" said Gilberthorpe, who is now 54 and would have been a teenager at the time.Trump had been promising that he would soon provide information showing the allegations against him were false.Gilberthorpe is known in Britain for his claims that he provided underage boys to British politicians for sex parties in the 1980s.Trump, 70, mocked Leeds on Friday. ""Believe me, she would not be my first choice, that I can tell you,"" he said.He called Natasha Stoynoff, a reporter who wrote in People magazine that Trump kissed her and pinned her against a wall, a ""liar"" and told the rally to ""check out her Facebook page, you'll understand.""
""TAKE THE HIGH GROUND""
Many Republicans have sought to distance themselves from Trump. The most senior of them, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, angered Trump when he announced this week he would no longer campaign for Trump or defend him but would focus on trying to preserve the Republican majorities in both the House and the Senate in the election.Ryan gave a campaign speech in Madison, Wisconsin, on Friday without mentioning Trump's name once. He urged college students to look beyond the ""ugliness"" of the presidential campaign to focus on issues such as tax and healthcare reform.""The kind of election we really want to have, it's not the one we're necessarily having right now,"" Ryan said, urging students to ""take the high ground.""Trump on Friday also accused Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, the top shareholder in The New York Times Company, of helping to generate the reports of sexual misconduct.He said Slim, as a donor to the Clinton Foundation charity and who holds a 17.35 percent stake in the Times, has an interest in helping Clinton's White House campaign.Arturo Elias, Slim's spokesman and son-in-law, said Slim had ""absolutely no contact"" with the newspaper's reporters or editors on their Trump campaign coverage and ""zero"" contact with the paper's news operations.New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. said in a statement, ""Carlos Slim is an excellent shareholder who fully respects boundaries regarding the independence of our journalism. He has never sought to influence what we report.""    Trump's allegation about Slim was the latest chapter in a running series of skirmishes he has had with Mexico and Mexicans.Trump kicked off his campaign last year accusing Mexico of sending rapists and drug dealers to the United States, and promised to build a wall along the southern U.S. border and said he would make Mexico pay for.

NEW YORK Silicon Valley heavyweight Peter Thiel will give $1.25 million as his first donation in support of Donald Trump's campaign after endorsing the U.S. Republican presidential candidate earlier this year, a spokesman for the investor said on Sunday.The donation will be made through a combination of political action committee donations and money directly to the campaign, the spokesman said. So far, billionaire Thiel has been the most prominent supporter of Trump from the country's technology hub.
The New York Times first reported news of Thiel's donation.A co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook Inc who sits on that company's board of directors, Thiel offered a full endorsement of Trump while speaking at the Republic National Convention in July. 
Thiel has not made any donations to the campaign of Trump's opponent in the Nov. 8 election, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, the spokesman said.

GOA, India Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday shrugged off new U.S. threats to retaliate against alleged Russian hackers, saying such statements only confirmed that Washington used cyber attacks for political ends.Speaking after a summit of developing economies in India Putin also said he believed that the hacking allegations were mainly election campaign rhetoric by the White House, and that he hoped bilateral ties could improve after the U.S. elections.U.S. Vice President Joe Biden told NBC News television on Friday that ""we are sending a message"" to Putin, and that retaliation for Russia's hacking attacks ""will be at the time of our choosing, and under the circumstances that will have the greatest impact"".The U.S. government this month formally accused Russia for the first time of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election.

By Emily Stephenson and Luciana Lopez

U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's full remarks to several Wall Street audiences appeared to become public on Saturday when the controversial transparency group Wikileaks dumped its latest batch of hacked emails.The documents showed comments by Clinton during question-and-answer sessions with Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and Tim O'Neill, the bank's head of investment management, at three separate events in 2013 in Arizona, New York and South Carolina. Some excerpts of Clinton's speeches had already been released. For more than a week, Wikileaks has published in stages what it says are hacked emails from the account of John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman. Clinton's campaign has declined to verify the emails. Goldman Sachs did not immediately provide any comment on Saturday.
Clinton came under fire for months for not releasing full details of her paid speeches to big business audiences, as opponents accused her of a cozy relationship with bankers and other members of the U.S. financial system.The excerpts that have surfaced so far angered voters who backed Clinton's former Democratic opponent, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who endorsed her after losing the party's primary.
Few of these voters are expected to vote for Republican nominee Donald Trump, who is dealing with his own larger scandal after the release last week of a 2005 video in which he bragged about making unwanted sexual advances toward women.But Democratic strategists worry that disappointment with Clinton could hurt turnout in the Nov. 8 election among liberals and younger voters, posing a potential problem for the former secretary of state.
In the email released on Saturday containing the transcripts, Clinton campaign staff highlighted sections that could pose problems, including saying ""political reasons"" factored into passing the 2010 Dodd-Frank law on Wall Street reforms and, while talking about regulation, saying the people who work in the industry know it best.
