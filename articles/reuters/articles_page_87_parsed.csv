By Melissa Fares
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's probability of winning the White House got a modest bump in online betting markets on Tuesday, a day after her debate with Republican Donald Trump.The price for a contract favoring Clinton on the popular PredictIt betting market was up 2 cents from Monday's post-debate closing and implied a 68 percent probability that she would win the Nov. 8 election. Although during the debate Clinton was as high as 70 percent, her Monday night closing of 66 matched the highest closing number since her health took a stumble on Sept. 11. A pro-Trump contract on Tuesday indicated his probability for victory was 34 percent.Trading in both contracts remained brisk on the heels of the first of three debates. PredictIt contracts are priced from 0 to 100 cents, with the contract price equating to a probability a candidate will win the election.
Initially, the price swings for both candidates were the largest since early August, though a substantial portion of Clinton's gain and Trump's fall had been retraced by early afternoon on Tuesday.The swing following the debate put the brakes on a big Trump price rally on PredictIt that coincided with a tightening in most public opinion polls. On PredictIt, the implied probability of him winning had risen to 38 percent heading into the debate from 28 percent at the end of August. 
Clinton's prospects also showed comparable improvement on betting sites based in Ireland and the United Kingdom. UK-based Betfair called the debate for Clinton based on odds movements on its platform, where more than 3 million pounds were bet during the event. The implied probability of a Clinton win in November climbed to 69 percent on Betfair, the strongest it has been since her prospects took a hit over her pneumonia diagnosis this month. Trump's probability fell to 30 percent from 37 percent.
On Ireland's PaddyPower, Clinton's odds also had shortened, or improved, to 2-to-5 from 1-to-2 in the early moments of Monday's debate. Trump's odds, which initially lengthened following the debate, had shortened modestly to 2-to-1.

Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump traded barbs and accusations on Monday in the first debate ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.Following is a compilation of reaction to the debate from investors, economists and financial market analysts:FACTBOX: Swing states that may determine the election: reut.rs/1UhE642MORE COVERAGE: cpurl://apps.cp./cms/?pageId=us-2016JAMES ATHEY, INVESTMENT MANAGER AT ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT:
""What we're seeing in markets this morning is a small, collective sigh of relief because most commentators, and the few polls that have been released, suggest Clinton won the debate. Equities have undone much of yesterday's weakness and key Trump indicators such as the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar have rallied. This supports the notion once again that Trump is seen as protectionist and anti-globalization.""The reality is that these moves are all fairly insignificant. Polls on voting intentions still show that the race is essentially neck and neck. It will be these polls which truly have the power to drive a genuine re-pricing.""MICHAEL METCALFE, HEAD OF GLOBAL MACRO STRATEGY AT STATE STREET GLOBAL MARKETS, LONDON: 
""In a similar way that sterling became the market proxy for Brexit risk, so moves in the Mexican peso and expected volatility of the Mexican peso appear to have become the main market proxy for expressing the probability of a Trump presidency. ""While there are many weeks of the campaign to run, the market reaction to the first debate does not mean that volatility will dissipate, but it does suggest Trump's recent momentum has been arrested.""""The recent narrowing in the polls means that markets have had to discount more uncertainty, and one debate will not settle that.""KIT JUCKES, FX STRATEGIST AT SOCIETE GENERALE, LONDON: 
""The press verdict on the first U.S. presidential debate is that Hillary Clinton 'won', but Donald Trump didn't lose badly enough to really reduce the uncertainty. The market verdict is that the Mexican peso, the South African rand and the Korean won all won, while the Japanese yen was the loser.""JACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT BMO PRIVATE BANK IN CHICAGO:
""Investors celebrated that Hillary didn't lose. Market trading higher and the peso is strengthening.""""Hillary came through the debate unscathed. Trump spent more time on the defensive.""
BRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO FUNDS MANAGEMENT, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN:
""I'm not sure I learned anything new listening to the debate. Neither candidate imploded, but based on the strengthening of the Mexican peso ... I think this round goes to Clinton.""RANDY FREDERICK, MANAGING DIRECTOR, TRADING AND DERIVATIVES, CHARLES SCHWAB, AUSTIN, TEXAS:
""The positive reaction in the (equities) futures markets probably implies that Hillary Clinton was perceived as the winner. The market is often said to dislike uncertainty, and most experts seem to consider Donald Trump as the more uncertain candidate.""PETER KENNY, SENIOR MARKET STRATEGIST, GLOBAL MARKETS ADVISORY GROUP, NEW YORK:
""Both futures and the Mexican peso are accurate indicators of how markets interpreted the debates. Both moved only modestly but both moved in tandem - higher. I believe that investors pricing in the odds of either candidate winning. Modest positive moves suggest the Clinton campaign both managed expectations and delivered on beating them. The fear for investors was that she would either have some physical issue, look weak or have an excuse for one or both. She looked sharp, on point and clearly delivered on a message and style that reassured markets.""BRIAN BATTLE, DIRECTOR OF TRADING, PERFORMANCE TRUST CAPITAL PARTNERS, CHICAGO:

""Debate really was not outside expectations. Trump was Trump and Clinton kept calm and seemed bemused. ""It was underwhelming on policy and there were no gaffes or revelations. It was a personality debate, not a policy discussion.""AARON JETT, VICE PRESIDENT, GLOBAL EQUITY RESEARCH, BEL AIR INVESTMENT ADVISORS, LOS ANGELES:
""The market wants Hillary to win. The better she does (or the worse Trump does) the better the market will do in the short term. She did well enough to sustain the market for now. She did fine and Trump rambled on at times making her look better. We should gain back some of what we lost on Monday.""J.J. KINAHAN, CHIEF STRATEGIST, TD AMERITRADE, CHICAGO:
""It is interesting that in a debate that was so full of negatives from both sides, the result in the Stock Index Futures was very positive. I guess it does show that some positives can come from an absolute free for all. I don't know that we learned much about the candidates but the market definitely liked it. Don't forget in the middle of this we also had some numbers showing slightly better growth than previously expected and that also helped the last 5 points or so in the futures rally.""After a weak day some of this may just be people covering their risk overnight.""
MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER, ALLIANZ, NEWPORT BEACH, CALIFORNIA: 
""While both candidates spoke to the importance of higher economic growth whose benefits are shared more broadly, the debate highlighted their different approaches to tax policies and what ultimately delivers greater prosperity.""HUGH JOHNSON, CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, HUGH JOHNSON ADVISORS, ALBANY, NEW YORK: 
""Both presented different views on reviving the economy. Secretary Clinton's tax and spending plans were well articulated and well thought out. Trump's thoughts that included significant tax cuts and implicit promises of infrastructure spending were emotionally appealing but not nearly as well thought out or economically sensible. Each will appeal to different sets of voters. A good example of Trump's emotional, yet uninformed, thoughts were his comments (a) that the recovery was the 'worst' ever, (b) that Janet Yellen was political, (c) the rise in stock prices has been a bubble that would 'burst' if interest rates were increased.""""I would be inclined to give Secretary Clinton a modest edge although Trump did a good job presenting himself as the candidate of change.""Her stamina answer was a real good - close to a clincher.""JEFFREY GUNDLACH, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, DOUBLELINE CAPITAL, LOS ANGELES:
""It's the establishment versus the anti-establishment. No one 'wins' a debate in September. Trump did himself a little bit of good and set up the later debates to his advantage.""DAN IVASCYN, GROUP CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, PIMCO, NEWPORT BEACH, CALIFORNIA:

By Michael Martina and Nobuhiro Kubo
| BEIJING/TOKYO

BEIJING/TOKYO Hillary Clinton put Donald Trump on the defensive and showed a better grasp of foreign policy issues, according to a sampling of people across Asia who watched the fiery first U.S. presidential debate.    In China, the debate was streamed live on China's Twitter-like Weibo service and attracted thousands of comments despite the lack of a translation into Chinese. Some called Trump ""a loose cannon"", while others thought that as a businessman he was best qualified to lead the world's largest economy. William Hua, a Chinese lawyer who watched the debate at an American Chamber of Commerce event in Beijing, said he thought Clinton came out on top.He was most concerned, though, about an issue that didn't come up in the debate. ""Donald Trump says Japan and South Korea can develop nuclear weapons? It seems absolutely ridiculous,"" Hua said. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times in March he would consider letting Japan and South Korea build their own nuclear weapons, rather than rely on America for protection against North Korea. Opinion polls have shown the two candidates in a tight race leading up to the debate.A CNN poll of debate watchers released after the event found 62 percent felt Clinton won compared to 27 percent for Trump.  In a sign investors also saw Clinton as the winner, U.S. S&P500 stock futures rose as did Asian shares. ""Markets started to call the debate for Hillary within the first 15 minutes or so, with the Mexican peso surging in what is probably its busiest Asian session in years,"" said Sean Callow, a senior currency analyst at Westpac in Sydney. The Mexican currency has risen and fallen in recent weeks depending on polling numbers for Trump, who has vowed to take trade protectionist measure against the United States' southern neighbor and build a wall across the U.S. border with Mexico to prevent illegal immigration.
CHINA BASHING   
Trump raised eyebrows among a packed crowd watching the debate at The American Club in Singapore when he lashed out against China. ""Look at what China is doing to our country,"" Trump said not long after the debate began. ""They are devaluing their currency and we have nobody in our government to fight them ... They are using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.""Landy Eng, a former employee of the California state government who's been living in Singapore the past 20 years, said he was an undecided voter. ""But Trump's China-bashing is something I'm not particularly in favor of,"" he said. Still, Eng said he does like the  ""disruptive"" factor of Trump's campaign and thinks it is making Clinton a better candidate.Aloysius Lee, a 65-year-old retiree from Hong Kong, who watched the debate at The Foreign Correspondents' Club in the territory, said that Trump was too unpredictable. 
""Hillary is the kind of person you can do business with, at least from my point of view,"" Lee said. With Trump, ""you don't know what's going to happen next, you don't know what he's going to say next"".NORTH ASIA ALLIANCES
South Koreans, watching the debate on TV screens in the lobby of Seoul's central train station, said they were with Clinton on the issues. ""Trump has ideas of withdrawing U.S. forces from our country, and in terms of national security, Trump is a threatening figure,"" said Lee Hyo-jin, 26. ""So I support Hillary,"" she said.Trump during the debate again said if U.S. allies like Japan and South Korea ""don't pay their fair share, they may have to defend themselves or help us out.""
Asked about Trump's comment, Japan's Defence Minister Tomomi Inada told a regularly scheduled news conference on Tuesday the U.S.-Japan military alliance does not just benefit Japan ""but is also in the interests of the United States."" Clinton seemed to have the better temperament during the debate, according to some Asian viewers. Li Jiaoli, 21, an editing intern from China's southwestern province of Sichuan, said Clinton seemed more presidential while Trump's expressions made her laugh. ""Trump's responses were too aggressive. High-level politicians should have more self-control,"" Li said.DEBATE OPTICS 
The debate prompted a storm of tweets around the region, many of them commenting on the optics of the debate.""Trump is looking worked up and angry and sulky and shouty -She looks utterly in control by contrast,"" said Barkha Dutt, news anchor on India's NDTV in a tweet. ""She ignores his barbs & attacks; he gets baited by every one of hers."" Mel Fryer, 30, a waitress at the Mercantile Hotel in Sydney's historic Rocks district said she was ""terrified"" at the prospect of a Trump presidency, while the debate screened to an empty pub. ""But he's going ok,"" she said of his debate performance. ""He uses simple words and simple phrases and gets his point across.""

| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Republican White House candidate Donald Trump stole the social media spotlight during Monday night's U.S. presidential debate on at least one count - what Twitter users branded his #Trumpsniffle. The wealthy businessman sniffed repeatedly as he faced off against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in their first debate, giving rise to the hashtag and a surge of interest on social media what might be causing his nose to run. Parody accounts, Donald's Sinuses (@TrumpsSinuses) and Trump sniff (@TrumpSniff), gained a large following.Trump, 70, told Fox News on Tuesday morning he did not have a cold. ""No, no sniffles, no,"" he said. ""No cold."" He complained he had a faulty microphone and joked that maybe it was picking up breathing.Several tweeters seized on the sniffling to hit back at Trump over his repeated digs at the health and stamina of Clinton, 68, who had pneumonia earlier this month. 
Overall, Twitter said the debate, the first in a series ahead of the Nov. 8 election, was the most tweeted-about political event in the social media company's history. Trump was the focus of 62 percent of the conversation on the social media platform, Twitter said.On Facebook, conversations about Trump made up 79 percent of debate chat, while Clinton's share of the conversation was 21 percent.
However, sentiment appeared to go Clinton's way. Social media analytics firm Zoomph said tweets mentioning Clinton ended at a ratio of about 1.5 to 1, which meant that for every negative mention, there were 1.5 positive mentions, Zoomph said.Sentiment toward Trump fluctuated, but ended nearly flat at a ratio of one positive mention to every negative one.
The most tweeted-about topics were the economy, foreign affairs, energy and the environment, terrorism and guns. (Reporting by Angela Moon; Editing by Howard Goller and Frances Kerry)"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	['guns']

| HEMPSTEAD, New York

HEMPSTEAD, New York Running as an anti-establishment candidate, Donald Trump took the presidential debate stage on Monday night to hammer home his call for sweeping political change and try to win over millions of undecided voters. But the Republican nominee seemed unable to capitalize on his opportunity in front of a television audience that by some estimates may have been 100-million strong. Instead of presenting himself as a change agent, he spent most of the evening trading personal insults with his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.It illustrated the paradox that has plagued Trump's campaign. Polls show an electorate hungry for change, with a majority believing the country is on the wrong track. Yet Trump's brash personality and his tendency to stir up controversy have made him, at times, a poor messenger. Trump started strongly on Monday, sticking to the bread and butter theme of his campaign - the erosion of U.S. manufacturing jobs. But he soon lost his composure, especially when Clinton questioned his success in business and his refusal to release his tax returns and accused him of racism and sexism. When on message Trump paints a bleak picture of a United States that is victimized by China in trade, hemorrhaging jobs to Mexico and blighted by gangs of illegal immigrants roaming the streets of ""warzone"" inner cities committing crimes. Robert Adams, 75, an undecided voter from Boise, Idaho, said he thought Trump's dystopian view of America was correct. ""I think it's hell in the big cities,"" Adams said.But after watching the debate, he viewed both the real estate magnate and Clinton as a ""sad"" choice for American voters and was leaning toward Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson.
Reuters/Ipsos polling shows an electorate in a downcast mood, with 64 percent of Americans believing the country is on the wrong track. That number includes 87 percent of Republicans and 44 percent of Democrats.When Reuters asked voters to pick the first word that comes to mind when thinking about the country, the most popular choice was ""frustration,"" followed by ""fear"" and ""anger."" Some of Trump's strongest moments at Monday's debate were when he categorized Clinton, a former secretary of state and U.S. senator as a ""typical politician,"" accusing her of achieving nothing in her years in Congress and government.
With an electorate yearning for change, Clinton is hamstrung by her long record and her close association with the Obama administration. Rather than proposing wholesale political overhaul, Clinton  offers up a vision of a country headed in the right direction but one that needs some changes to address income inequality and create jobs. Her more optimistic view impressed another undecided voter, Nancy Willhite, 61, of Portland, Oregon. ""She seems more in touch with reality to me,"" she said. A Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Monday found that about half of all likely voters in the United States were looking to the debate to help them make a final decision. 
Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist in Washington, said Trump's performance on Monday would have left many undecided voters with questions about his ability to lead the country.""Donald Trump has to convince them that he is going to be a safe alternative and I think it's open to debate whether he pulled that off,"" Bonjean said. Christopher Devine, a political science professor at the University of Dayton in Ohio said Trump's message on Monday sometimes got lost in a welter of hyperbole that invited mocking responses from Clinton. ""He'll identify a problem people are concerned about, but in that excitement over making that point, he goes overboard and makes claims that don't hold up. It loses its effectiveness at that point."" (Reporting by James Oliphant, Ginger Gibson, and Chris Kahn.

| NEW YORK

NEW YORK U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's probability of winning the White House gained in online betting markets following the first debate of the campaign on Monday night between her and Republican Donald Trump.A Clinton contract on the popular PredictIt betting market gained 6 cents from the previous day's level to 69 cents, while a contract favoring Donald Trump's prospects for victory tumbled 7 cents to 31 cents. Contracts are priced from 0 cents to 100 cents, with the contract price equating to a probability of whether that candidate will win the Nov. 8 election.The price swings for both candidates were the largest since early August, and placed Clinton's lead in that market at the widest in about two weeks.
Clinton's prospects also improved on the Irish betting site Paddy Power. About halfway through Monday's debate, she was shown as a 1-to-2 favorite, and those odds shortened to 4-to-9 in the moments after the debate ended. Trump's odds lengthened to 23-to-10 from 9-to-4.
The swing following the debate put the brakes on a big Trump price rally on PredictIt that coincided with a tightening in most public opinion polls. The implied probability of him winning had risen to 38 cents on Sunday from just 28 cents at the end of August. Bets on Trump fell as low as 5 cents on February but went up as high as 44 cents in May. Bets on Clinton, the persistent favorite in most wagering markets, went as low as 37 cents in January and as high as 79 cents in August. 
The debate on Monday was the first of three scheduled face-offs between the two candidates before the Nov. 8 election. (Reporting by Angela Moon; Writing by Dan Burns; Editing by Peter Cooney)"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

| MINOT AIR FORCE BASE, N.D.

MINOT AIR FORCE BASE, N.D. In this flat, windy expanse just south of the Canadian border, U.S. Air Force pilots fly the same bombers their grandfathers flew, using mid-20th century cables and pulleys.Each spring, the airmen and airwomen must clear melting snow from the steel and concrete doors of the silos that house 150 nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles scattered across thousands of square miles of the upper Great Plains.The U.S. nuclear arsenal, patched, welded, and re-skinned countless times, was built between 25 and 62 years ago when the United States found itself locked in an arms race with a rival superpower, the Soviet Union. Now, its future is an issue in the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election.Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has said she would call for a nuclear posture review, last completed in 2010, as one of her first acts upon taking office. Republican candidate Donald Trump has said he would be open to reversing decades of U.S. policy and allowing allies such as Japan and South Korea to acquire their own nuclear weapons to deter a strike from North Korea, which carried out its fifth and largest nuclear test this month.On Monday, in his first visit to Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota as U.S. Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter said America's nuclear deterrence was the ""bedrock"" of its security, and the Pentagon's No. 1 priority.""If we don't replace these systems, quite simply they will age even more, and become unsafe, unreliable, and ineffective,""  Carter said, speaking at a lectern in front of a B-52 bomber loaded with cruise missiles.""The fact is, most of our nuclear weapon delivery systems have already been extended decades beyond their original expected service lives. So it's not a choice between replacing these platforms or keeping them - it's really a choice between replacing them or losing them,"" Carter said.Russia, he said, had built new nuclear weapons systems, raising questions as to whether its leaders were cautious enough when it came to atomic weapons. And North Korea presents a sustained threat, Carter said.Carter's speech coincides with a growing realization among defense officials and experts that budget constraints almost certainly will force the next president to decide whether and how quickly to proceed with the Obama administration's plans to maintain and modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal.
CRUNCH TIME
The crunch comes in the next decade as American ballistic missile submarines, bombers, and land-based missiles - the three legs of the nuclear triad - reach the end of their useful lives.The Congressional Budget Office estimates the total cost of nuclear forces through 2024 at $348 billion, but that does not include some of the costliest upgrades, scheduled for the latter half of the next decade. Independent estimates have put the cost of maintaining and modernizing the arsenal at about $1 trillion dollars over 30 years.""There's a bipartisan commitment to doing that upgrade, so we have to assume those funds will come through,"" Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz told Reuters on Sept. 20. ""But it will be a significant budget increase, especially in the next decade.""The Energy Department shares responsibility with the Pentagon for the nuclear arsenal, and some of its research and production facilities are 73 years old.The next administration could abandon or delay some aspects of modernization to cut costs. Or it could raise taxes, increase the budget deficit, or cut domestic programs, all unpopular steps with American voters.
The most vulnerable elements of the modernization plans are a long-range standoff weapon, or LRSO - a nuclear-capable cruise missile launched from an aircraft - and new land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).Ten U.S. senators, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, called on President Barack Obama in July to cancel the LRSO, saying it ""would provide an unnecessary capability that could increase the risk of nuclear war.""Some Pentagon officials and defense experts have said the cruise missile would be a hedge against improved air defenses that are difficult for even a stealthy bomber to penetrate.A Clinton or Trump administration also could cut the number of land-based ballistic missiles below the 400 currently planned or delay a new missile by extending the life of the current Minuteman IIIs, which each carry a warhead with an explosive yield of at least 300 kilotons, 20 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, which killed an estimated 140,000 people. The United States is one of five nuclear weapons states allowed to keep a nuclear arsenal under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The others are Russia, Britain, France and China.
The U.S. Air Force has estimated the cost of a new ground-based system - including missiles, command-and-control systems and launch control centers - to be more than $60 billion.    Some former U.S. officials, including former defense secretary William Perry, have argued that land-based missiles are not essential and should be phased out; proponents say they are more important in the face of potential nuclear threats by Russia and North Korea.Much of the planned modernization is nearly locked in  because of the need for new weapons and because some of it is so far along, said Evan Montgomery, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington-based research group.The B-21 long-range strike bomber and the replacement for the Navy's 14 Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines are ""the two most expensive items, and they're arguably the two safest in a lot of ways,"" Montgomery said. The bomber can deliver both conventional and nuclear weapons, and the submarine is considered a priority because it would survive any first strike by an adversary.The Navy plans to replace its Ohio-class submarines, first commissioned in 1981 and armed with up to 24 Trident missiles with multiple independently targeted warheads, with 12 boats costing about $100 billion.In his speech on Monday, Carter said that most people do not realize that spending on the nuclear program is a small percentage of total defense spending. At its peak, nuclear spending would make up about five percent of the Pentagon's budget, which is now around $600 billion annually, defense experts said.Still, the funding gap means that despite the Pentagon's massive budget, the next president will face an unavoidable dilemma.""There's no doubt in my mind that we're tens of billions of dollars short in that time frame from what it takes to execute a global strategy,"" said James Miller, a former undersecretary of defense for policy in the Obama administration. ""It's not a rounding error anymore.""

By Valerie Volcovici and Julia Harte
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday avoided direct mention of a pipeline that has provoked high-profile protests from Native Americans but urged tribal leaders to use the spotlight to continue pushing for recognition even after he leaves office.Obama spoke at his eighth and final Tribal Nations Conference, which he created during his first year in office. Leaders of more than 560 Native American tribes gathered for the Washington event as one of the largest Native American protests in decades continues in North Dakota.In his remarks, Obama acknowledged that Native American tribes have unified around the demonstrations led by the Standing Rock Sioux, a tribe that he visited in 2014.  ""I know that many of you have come together across tribes and across the country to support the community at Standing Rock and together you are making your voices heard,"" he said. ""This moment highlights why it's so important that we redouble our efforts to make sure that every federal agency truly consults and listens and works with you, sovereign to sovereign.""In recent weeks, protests against the Dakota Access pipeline have drawn international attention, prompting the U.S. government to temporarily block its construction on federal land. Tribal leaders say the pipeline will desecrate sacred land and pollute water.When fully connected to existing lines, the 1,100-mile (1,770 km) pipeline would be the first to carry crude oil from the Bakken shale directly to the U.S. Gulf. The $3.7 billion project is being built by the Dakota Access subsidiary of Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP.Obama discussed the progress made by his administration over the last eight years to improve relations with tribal nations, and urged leaders to keep fighting for more visibility and input regardless of who succeeds him in the White House next year.""Our progress depends in part on who sits the in Oval Office, and whether they're setting the right priorities, but lasting progress depends on all of us, not just who the president is.""
Various Obama administration officials unveiled initiatives aimed at upholding Native American sovereignty at the conference.Interior Secretary Sally Jewell announced a forthcoming memorandum from Obama that would require federal agencies to consider Native American treaty rights in decision-making on natural resource projects, hoping to avoid future conflicts with tribes such as the current Dakota Access dispute.The Justice and Interior Departments also announced  settlements with 17 tribes that had sued the U.S. government, accusing them of mismanaging monetary assets and natural resources that the government held in trust for the tribes. The ""vast majority"" of all such disputes have been settled, according to the government, which has paid $1.9 billion to resolve the cases since April 2012.
Those settlements characterize the Obama administration's effort to mend ties ""where we have failed in the past in our trust responsibilities,"" said Lawrence Roberts, assistant secretary for Indian Affairs at the Interior Department, on the sidelines of Monday's conference.Regan Dunn, 15, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, delivered opening remarks at the conference. Dunn said afterward she had never imagined a company might try to build a pipeline through her homeland, but that the wide opposition among various tribes - including some she had not previously heard of - has been ""heartwarming.""Brian Cladoosby, president of the National Congress of American Indians, which represents more than 500 tribes, praised Obama's legacy on Native American issues and warned the assembly that ""there is no guarantee going forward there will be the same commitment from the next administration.""
When the Justice Department, Interior Department and the U.S. Army temporarily blocked the pipeline's construction on Sept. 9, the administration called for ""a serious discussion"" about how tribes are consulted by the government on decisions over major infrastructure projects. The Army, Interior and Justice departments will hold hearings on the shortcomings of the present process on Oct. 11, and formal discussions with tribes in six U.S. regions from Oct. 25 through Nov. 21. The deadline for written comments will be Nov. 30, the agencies announced.On Thursday, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, Dave Archambault, told a House of Representatives panel there was no ""meaningful consultation"" before permits were issued to bring the pipeline through his tribe's territory.Archambault is scheduled to speak on Monday evening at a rally of pipeline opponents.

CANNON BALL, N.D./WASHINGTON Three days after guard dogs attacked Native Americans protesting an oil pipeline project in North Dakota in early September, an unprecedented event took place at the White House.Brian Cladoosby, president of the National Congress of American Indians, which represents more than 500 tribes, spoke to nearly a dozen of President Barack Obama's Cabinet-level advisers at a September 6 meeting of the White House's three-year-old Native American Affairs Council. It was the first time a tribal leader addressed a session of the council, and Cladoosby was invited in his role as the Indian Congress' leader.Cladoosby, a Swinomish Indian from Washington state, spoke twice at the one-hour roundtable. He told Reuters he praised the Obama administration in his opening statement for its track record on Native American issues such as pushing to reform the Indian Health Service.But when Cladoosby gave his closing speech, he delivered an impassioned request to his audience: stand with Native Americans who have united with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and block construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, a 1,100 mile conduit to get oil from North Dakota to Illinois. That plea marked one of the previously unreported turning points in a drama that played out since February and culminated September 9 with an about face by the U.S. government, from giving the pipeline a green light to backing a request from North Dakota's Standing Rock Sioux to halt construction of the pipeline. The tribe fears sacred sites could be destroyed during the line's construction and that a future oil spill would pollute its drinking water.This month's win for the tribe, which could be reversed by regulators, is a rare instance of protests resulting in quick federal action and the triumph of an unusual alliance between environmentalists and Native Americans, who both say they were emboldened by the defeat of the Keystone XL pipeline last fall.It also was the most galvanizing movement in Native American politics in decades, some tribal leaders said, as Crow, Navajo, Sioux and other traditional rivals united to fight what they considered an assault on their way of life.Cladoosby did not play a high-profile role in the early days of the pipeline controversy. But that day he spoke to a high echelon of power, including Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell, White House Domestic Policy Council director Cecilia Munoz, and the heads of the Departments of Energy; Agriculture; Education; Health and Human Services; and the Environmental Protection Agency, according to a senior administration official who asked not to be named and to a photo of attendees seen by Reuters.""The world is watching,"" he said in prepared remarks shared with Reuters.A few days earlier, video of pipeline security personnel in North Dakota armed with guard dogs and mace trying to disperse protesters went viral on social media.One of the first videos was taken and posted on Facebook by Lonnie Favel, a member of Utah's Ute tribe who traveled to North Dakota to support the protests.""I was getting messages of support from New Zealand, from Europe, from all over the world,"" Favel said.Until then, Obama had not weighed in on the Dakota dispute even though he personally had visited  the Standing Rock in June 2014.Just a day after Cladoosby issued his plea to administration officials, Obama attended a young leaders conference in Laos where a Malaysian woman asked him about the Dakota Access pipeline and how he could ensure a clean water supply and protect ancestral land.Obama said he needed to ask his staff for more information, but touted his track record protecting Native Americans' ""ancestral lands, sacred sites, waters and hunting grounds,"" adding, ""this is something that I hope will continue as we go forward.""
A FATEFUL DECISION
In late 2014, pipeline operator Energy Transfer Partners made a fateful decision.Dallas-based ETP chose to route its proposed Dakota Access pipeline away from North Dakota's capital, Bismarck, and southward within half a mile of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe's reservation.Part of its rationale, laid out in a report for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which regulates infrastructure projects that traverse certain inland waterways, was that the route would avoid Bismarck and thus pose no threat to the city's water supply. The Bismarck route also is more populated and thus would require more easements from multiple landowners. Ironically, that 139-page report concluded the Standing Rock route would raise ""no environmental justice issues"" because the pipeline would not cross tribal lands.The Army Corps' decision angered environmental activists and unwittingly introduced a powerful new element into the environmental movement: Indian rights groups, who quickly tapped into an extensive network of green activists forged during five long years of protests against TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline, which Obama formally nixed last November.CAMPAIGN GAINS STEAM
The protest gained steam in February when Standing Rock Sioux leaders asked for legal help from Earthjustice, an environmental law group that had previously helped U.S. tribes and Canadian First Nations fight Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain pipeline, according to Jan Hasselman, an attorney from Earthjustice working on the North Dakota case, and tribal leaders.
Two months later, about 18 tribe members started praying daily near the pipeline's planned route in North Dakota. The participants would grow in size, creating a group called the Sacred Stone Camp.The international environmental movement soon took notice, including, 350.org, an environmentalist group that helped defeat the Keystone XL pipeline. In July, the group sent a delegation to the Sacred Stone Camp to see how they could help.In many ways, the Dakota Access pipeline drew its inspiration from the fight to stop the Keystone XL pipeline, according to organizers from 350 and other environmental groups.""We didn't have to totally reinvent the wheel,"" said Josh Nelson of Credo, a progressive advocacy group.By then the Sacred Stone Camp, located alongside the confluence of the Cannon Ball and Missouri rivers about an hour south of Bismarck, had swollen in size to thousands, forming a de facto town of  tents, teepees and trailers, a school, medic, communal kitchen, horse corrals and a legal clinic.The tribal members and environmentalists agreed to seize on the U.S. Army Corps' ""fast-tracking"" of permits for the pipeline in late July, which they argued was illegal and a violation of tribal rights, 350.org told Reuters. In this case, the Corps had the right to approve pipelines in general and consider specific local concerns, such as Native issues, if appropriate. The Corps said it effectively considered its due diligence requirement met when it green lit the line in July. Later that same month, the tribe filed suit against the Army Corps in federal court.
INTERNAL RIFT
While the government's reversal in September caught most by surprise, a March 29 letter from the Department of the Interior to the Army Corps reviewed by Reuters shows that disagreements within the administration had been percolating for months.The Interior department, which is responsible for protecting Native Americans' welfare, said the Army Corps ""did not adequately justify or otherwise support its conclusion that there would be no significant impacts upon the surrounding environment and community"" from the pipeline.Energy Transfer, the Department of Justice, the Army Corps and the Department of the Interior did not respond to requests for comment.The letter presaged the intra-government fighting ahead of the White House's decision to temporarily block the line.The federal delay of the pipeline ""isn't something that just fell out of the sky,"" Archambault, the tribe's chairman, said in an interview. ""We feed (federal regulators) information all the time on everything that's illegal here.""Archambault declined to discuss responses from federal regulators he received.On September 9, just three days after Cladoosby made his plea at the White House, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg rejected a request from the tribe to block the $3.7 billion project.Minutes after that ruling, the Interior and Justice Departments, along with the Army Corps, suspended construction on a two-mile stretch of federal land below the Missouri River.White House spokesman Josh Earnest said federal regulators, who could still ultimately approve the project, called the pause to make sure the concerns of all parties were taken into account. James Gette, a senior official in the environment and natural resources division of the DOJ, noted in a September 16 hearing that construction was halted mainly because the Dakota Access pipeline didn't have an easement for the area where the tribe gets its drinking water.Protesters have vowed not to leave their camp until the pipeline is scrapped or moved far away from their reservation. Their concerns about potential spills, it turns out, have precedent.An analysis of government data by Reuters shows that Sunoco Logistics, the future operator of the pipeline and a unit of ETP, has had the highest rate of spills since 2010 than any of its competitors. Sunoco told Reuters it has taken measures to reduce its spill rate.Cladoosby admits he ""was really surprised"" by the fast moving events after his strategically-timed entreaty.He will be back at the White House on Monday and Tuesday. Leaders of 567 native American tribes will meet with Obama in Washington to tackle a range of issues facing Native Americans from economic development to environmental protection - including the Dakota Access pipeline.(This version of the story corrects the first name of White House Domestic Policy Council director to Cecilia, not Celia in paragraph 10) (Additional reporting by Mica Rosenberg, Ruthy Munoz, Julia Harte and Timothy Gardner; Writing By Terry Wade and Ernest Scheyder; editing by Eric Effron and Edward Tobin)"	['Nelson', 'Mica', 'Obama']	[]

WASHINGTON Democratic Senator Mark Warner on Monday asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate whether Yahoo (YHOO.O) and its senior executives fulfilled obligations to inform investors and the public about a hacking attack affecting 500 million user accounts.""Disclosure is the foundation of federal securities laws, and public companies are required to disclose material events that shareholders should know about,"" Warner said in a letter to SEC Chairwoman Mary Jo White.Yahoo has faced pointed questions about exactly when it knew about the 2014 cyber attack announced last week that exposed the email credentials of half a billion accounts, a critical issue for the company as it seeks to prevent the breach from affecting a pending takeover of its core business by Verizon Inc (VZ.N).Warner also asked the SEC to probe whether Yahoo has ""made complete and accurate representations"" about the security of its information technology systems, and for the agency to evaluate its current thresholds for how and when companies need to report a material data breach.Although the SEC has longstanding guidance on when publicly traded companies should report hacking incidents, companies that have experienced known breaches often omit those details in regulatory filings, according to a 2012 Reuters investigation.(reut.rs/2dblx5S)
In a Sept. 9 regulatory filing with the SEC, Yahoo stated it did not have knowledge of ""any incidents of, or third party claims alleging ... unauthorized access"" of personal data of its customers that could have a material adverse effect on Verizon's acquisition.Establishing that Yahoo is liable for damages under SEC rules is a ""pretty high bar"" in data breach cases, said Robert Cattanach, a lawyer at Dorsey & Whitney who specializes in cyber security. 
Yahoo is additionally protected from liability given the relative lack of sensitivity of the data compromised, Cattanach said, though he said both the SEC and Federal Trade Commission were likely to open investigations.At least one state, Massachusetts, is also seeking more information from Yahoo about the breach, a spokesperson for the state's attorney general told Reuters on Monday. Yahoo has so far not provided a clear, detailed timeline about when it was made aware of the breach announced Thursday. 
Cyber security services firm Stroz Friedberg has been hired by Yahoo to help investigate the breach, firm spokeswoman Carolyn Vadino said. The FBI is also investigating the hack, which Yahoo has blamed on a ""state-sponsored actor"" although the company has not provided technical information to support that claim.
