 (Editor's note: This story contains language in the second paragraph that may offend readers)BOSTON Maine legislative leaders are set to meet on Thursday to discuss whether to push for the resignation of Governor Paul LePage, a week after he left an obscenity-laden voicemail for a lawmaker who had criticized him for making racially charged comments.The meeting comes a day after LePage, a Republican who earlier in the week discussed the possibility of not finishing his term in a radio interview, said he would seek ""spiritual counseling"" but not resign after calling Democratic State Representative Drew Gattine a ""little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker.""The Democratic speaker of the Maine House, Mark Eves, and the Republican president of Maine Senate, Michael Thibodeau, will be attending the 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT) meeting, according to their representatives, as will several lower-ranking members of the legislative leadership.The state House and Senate both adjourned in April, so the leaders would need to agree on the need for a special session before setting any votes calling for LePage's resignation or censure.
Earlier this year a group of lawmakers started an effort to impeach him, contending the governor overstepped his authority by threatening to withhold funds from a nonprofit group that hired a political rival, but that effort collapsed before making it to the full House.LePage has been in the national spotlight for making repeated statements blaming out-of-state black and Hispanic people for the heroin trade in Maine. He has rejected any allegations of racism, saying his sole concern is saving lives in the state.
The two-term governor, whose current term extends through 2018, has apologized for the language he used in the voicemail.Gattine has joined the chorus of lawmakers calling for LePage to step down.
The minority Republican leadership of the House have backed LePage, saying they accept his apology and want to move on. (Reporting by Scott Malone; Editing by Bill Trott)"

By Emily Stephenson
| PHOENIX

PHOENIX Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed on Wednesday that anyone who is in the United States illegally would be subject to deportation if he is elected, sticking with his hardline position after flirting with a softer approach.In a major speech in the border state of Arizona, Trump took a dim view of the 11 million people who crossed into the United States illegally, a week after saying many were ""great people"" who had lived in the country for years and contributed to American society.He said all people in the United States illegally would have ""only one route"" to gain legal status if Trump were to win the Nov. 8 presidential election: ""To return home and apply for re-entry.""""Our message to the world will be this: You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country,"" Trump said.""People will know you can't just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized,"" he said. ""Those days are over.""Trump again vowed that Mexico would pay for construction of a ""great border wall"" between the two countries. He spoke hours after Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto told Trump in a face-to-face meeting in Mexico City that Mexico would not pay for it.""We will build a great wall along the southern border,"" Trump said. ""And Mexico will pay for the wall - 100 percent. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for the wall.""Trump said at a joint news conference with Pena Nieto that he and the Mexican leader did not discuss who would pay for the wall. Pena Nieto remained silent on the issue at the event, but said later on Twitter he did raise the issue.""At the beginning of the conversation with Donald Trump I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall,"" Pena Nieto said in a tweet.HARDLINE RETURN

Trump used the Phoenix speech to clarify his stance on illegal immigration after prevaricating on the issue last week. He returned to the hardline rhetoric that powered him to the Republican presidential nomination over 16 rivals, heartening those conservatives drawn to Trump by the issue.Ann Coulter, a conservative activist who had fretted that Trump might be softening, tweeted: ""I hear Churchill had a nice turn of phrase, but Trump's immigration speech is the most magnificent speech ever given.""Correct The Record, an organization supporting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the Nov.8 presidential election, slammed Trump.""Tonight confirmed what we knew all along - there is no 'softening',"" Correct The Record spokeswoman Elizabeth Shappell said.Trump's ""America First"" positions are aimed at rallying middle-class people who feel they have lost jobs to illegal immigrants or to the outsourcing of jobs abroad.
However, he may have put himself at risk of limiting his ability to broaden his base of support to include more Hispanic-Americans and more moderate Republican voters who do not think it is possible or practical to crack down on all illegal immigrants. In his speech, Trump emphasized that his priority would be to quickly deport those among the undocumented population who have committed serious crimes.""As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities,"" Trump said. ""Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have a country."" He said he would form a commission to study which regions or countries he would suspend immigration from, saying Syria and Libya would be high on his list. This would be his way of carrying out his proposed ban on Muslims from some countries without getting into their religious affiliation.Trump said he would also establish a ""deportation task force"" to identify criminals subject to deportation, would triple the number of federal deportation officers, and increase the number of border patrol stations.
MILD REBUKE, PROTESTS
Trump is trailing Clinton in opinion polls and the New York businessman's aides hoped the trip would make him look presidential and show he was willing to deal head-on with  thorny issues such as relations with Mexico.Pena Nieto said at the joint news conference with Trump in Mexico City that the many millions of Mexicans in the United States deserved respect. However, he offered only a mild rebuke of Trump for his rhetoric.""The Mexican people has felt aggrieved by comments that have been made, but I was sure his interest in building a relationship is genuine,"" Pena Nieto said.A few dozen demonstrators gathered beneath a monument to Mexican independence in the center of the capital to protest against the visit, some holding placards emblazoned with captions such as: ""You are not Wall-come"" and ""Trump and Pena out.""   Trump has been pilloried in Mexico since he launched his White House campaign last year.Clinton, a former secretary of state, said on Wednesday Trump could not paper over his previous harsh language against Mexico.""It certainly takes more than trying to make up for more than a year of insults and insinuations by dropping in on our neighbors for a few hours and then flying home again,"" she told a convention of the American Legion military veterans' group in Cincinnati.

HONOLULU Preserving natural places will help the world adapt to warming temperatures, U.S. President Barack Obama said on Wednesday as he began a 10-day trip to stress the urgency of curbing climate change and attend a G20 meeting in China.""No nation, not even one as powerful as the United States, is immune from a changing climate,"" Obama said after landing in Hawaii, the Pacific island state where he grew up.Obama, who is racing to cement his legacy on climate change before his presidency ends on Jan. 20, will make a rare visit to Midway Atoll on Thursday, deep inside the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument where he expanded protections last week.The tour leads up to a meeting in China on Saturday with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is hosting the G20 group of leading economies.
Obama and Xi worked together in Paris last year to secure a global deal to cut carbon emissions and are expected to take the next steps soon to help bring that agreement into force.Native Hawaiian student Narrissa Spies said she hoped Obama's trip to Midway would inspire him. Spies, 34, went there in 2010 on a ""life-changing"" marine studies visit.""I saw what my ancestors must have seen on the main Hawaiian Islands 200 years ago,"" said Spies, a PhD candidate now studying coral resistant to stresses like warming water.
Earlier on Wednesday, Obama stopped in to a summit about the health of Lake Tahoe, the deep alpine lake in the Sierra Nevada mountains on the Nevada-California border whose average surface temperature reached an all-time recorded high last year.""The challenges of conservation and combating climate change are connected, they're linked,"" said Obama, who was interrupted by protesters yelling: ""Keep it in the ground,"" a campaign to limit fossil fuel production.
Green groups have urged Obama not to rest on his laurels. The U.S. Supreme Court put his plan to slash carbon emissions from power plants on hold earlier this year.""We're hoping that he will actually withdraw the Arctic from his five-year plan on offshore drilling, like he did with the Atlantic, because it's an even worse place to drill,"" said marine biologist Jackie Savitz of the Oceana conservation group.

By Dave Graham
| MEXICO CITY

MEXICO CITY Mexico's president rebuked Donald Trump as a threat to his country just hours after painting a positive picture of talks the two held on Wednesday to try to defuse tensions over the U.S. presidential hopeful's anti-Mexican campaign rhetoric.President Enrique Pena Nieto had on Wednesday afternoon hailed as ""open and constructive"" the impromptu meeting he held with Trump, who later referred to the Mexican leader as his friend and a ""wonderful"" president.But in a late evening television interview, an angry-looking Pena Nieto sought to defend himself against a broad swathe of criticism for his decision to invite the Republican candidate despite his repeated verbal attacks on Mexico.""His policy stances could represent a huge threat to Mexico, and I am not prepared to keep my arms crossed and do nothing,"" Pena Nieto said. ""That risk, that threat, must be confronted. I told him that is not the way to build a mutually beneficial relationship for both nations.""Trump's quick acceptance of an invitation sent last Friday took Mexico's government by surprise, and his visit to Mexico City came just hours ahead of a keynote speech on immigration as he sought to close the gap on Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.The real estate mogul's accusations that Mexico sends rapists and drug runners to the United States, and his threats to build a border wall and tear up trade deals, have angered the government but his meeting with Pena Nieto on Wednesday gave him a chance to present himself in a more moderate light.He spoke of Mexican-Americans in glowing terms and stressed the areas of common interest between the two countries even as he stuck to his message that he would put up the wall.Pena Nieto had likened Trump to dictators Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini earlier this year. But his government said Trump understood its concerns at the meeting, making Pena Nieto's tense appearance on television the more surprising.
""What we saw was a respectful attitude and discourse from Donald Trump,"" presidential spokesman Eduardo Sanchez had said earlier, arguing that progress was made on the issue of trade after prior threats by Trump to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).""I think there was an advance in general,"" he added.Still, Trump laid out a series of tough policies to tackle illegal immigration when he delivered his speech in Phoenix, Arizona, on Wednesday night.He told a cheering crowd that Mexico would pay for the wall ""100 percent"" and that if he wins the election anyone living illegally in the United States would be sent back to their home country and made to apply for re-entry. 
That would include millions of Mexicans.Opposition politicians in Mexico rounded on Pena Nieto for hosting Trump.""Instead of making him apologize, the government allowed (Trump) to complete the humiliation of the Mexicans,"" Ricardo Anaya, leader of the center-right opposition National Action Party, said on Twitter.
WALL TO WALL
Some Mexican officials also privately expressed reservations about the meeting with one former diplomat saying Pena Nieto had done Trump's campaign a favor.During a joint news conference after their meeting, Trump said he and Pena Nieto had not discussed his demand that Mexico pay for the border wall.But Pena Nieto later contradicted Trump, saying he had told the American that Mexico would not foot the bill, and he bristled during his television interview when asked why he had not made that clear at the news conference.Speaking on condition of anonymity, a Mexican government official said the two men spoke English during the meeting and that Pena Nieto clearly explained to Trump the offense his comments had caused.""He's a candidate that offended a lot of Mexicans, so that's the chemistry there was (between them),"" the official said.

By Scott Malone

Maine Governor Paul LePage said on Wednesday he would not resign and was seeking spiritual advice after unleashing an obscenity-laden voicemail message on a political rival, as state lawmakers mulled whether to vote to censure the Republican.The famously combative two-term governor apologized for the second day straight to the people of Maine and to state Representative Drew Gattine after calling the Democrat a ""little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker"" in a voicemail message that has been widely circulated.""I will not resign,"" LePage told reporters in his office in the state capital, Augusta, a day after discussing the possibility in a radio appearance.LePage's angry voicemail followed an exchange with a newspaper reporter who asked about comments the governor had made blaming black and Hispanic people for the heroin trade in the Northeastern state. The reporter named Gattine as someone who had raised concerns about the comments, although both agree the Democrat never called the governor a racist.The voicemail ended with LePage urging Gattine to share it widely ""because I am after you.""After meeting with Gattine on Wednesday, LePage said: ""He never called me racist. He said I made racially comments. Maybe in my mind it is semantics but in his mind after talking to him it was clear that there was a real difference.""
LePage, whose term runs through 2018, said he ""will be seeking spiritual guidance with my wife and my children.""'GASOLINE ON THAT FIRE'
The Republican-led state Senate is still deliberating whether to call a special session to vote to censure LePage, said Majority Leader Michael Thibodeau.
""We can't continue to have the explosiveness that we've seen and so we're in hopes that he's going to find a way to correct that,"" said Thibodeau, who would take over as governor if LePage stepped down. ""We live in a time in America when racial tensions are high and we don't need to be throwing gasoline on that fire.""Republicans in the state's Democratic-led House of Representatives said they accepted LePage's apology and were ready to move on.But House Speaker Mark Eves, a Democrat, called for a meeting of lawmakers to discuss LePage's resignation or removal from office.
""The governor's comments today do nothing to address his increasingly erratic behavior that demonstrates he is unfit to lead,"" Eves said in a statement.LePage on Tuesday morning mused on stepping down, saying he was not necessarily committed to finishing his term and adding: ""It's one thing not to have one party behind you, it's another thing not to have any party behind you.""Hours later, he changed his tune, paraphrasing Mark Twain as he tweeted: ""The reports of my political demise are greatly exaggerated,"" before trying to change the subject with messages on a visit to a tissue factory.""Maybe my temperament for the poor and the underdog is over the top but I'll live my life that way. I'm comfortable fighting for the underdog,"" LePage said. ""I'm just not a very good politician."" (Reporting by Scott Malone in Boston; Editing by James Dalgleish and Peter Cooney)"

A life-sized nude statue of U.S. Republican presidential contender Donald Trump is going up for auction, with profits from the sale going to an immigrant support group.Julien's Auctions said on Wednesday that the statue, called ""The Emperor Has No Balls,"" is expected to fetch $10,000 to $20,000 at the Oct. 22 auction in Los Angeles.The statue is one of a series that appeared unannounced in public spaces in New York and four other U.S. cities earlier in August. The orange-tinted likeness showed Trump with a massive belly, small fingers and some missing genitals.Most were confiscated or destroyed by local authorities and the Los Angeles statue is the only one remaining, Julien's said.
The statues were created by an anonymous artists collective called INDECLINE. A portion of the auction profits will go to the National Immigration Forum, which campaigns for the rights of immigrants.
Trump has pledged to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico to keep immigrants out and to deport the millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States, should he be elected. He is due to give a speech on Wednesday as he seeks to find a balance in his immigration stance.Trump is not the only politician to be represented in the October auction of street and contemporary art. American pop artist Knowledge Bennett's ""Hillary Clinton Cojones,"" featuring the Democratic White House hopeful wearing a tuxedo, is expected to fetch up to $15,000, Julien's said.

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a bid by North Carolina to reinstate for November's elections several voting restrictions, including a requirement that people show identification at the polls.The eight-justice court, divided in most part 4-4, rejected a request made by Republican Governor Pat McCrory after an appeals court ruled last month that the 2013 law discriminates against minority voters. Five votes are needed for an emergency request to be granted.""We're thrilled. Elections in North Carolina this fall are going to be conducted under a fair and nondiscriminatory election law scheme,"" said Allison Riggs, a lawyer with the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, one of the civil rights groups that challenged the law.The U.S. Justice Department, which has also been involved in fighting the law, did not immediately comment on the decision.
McCrory said in a statement that the state ""has been denied basic voting rights already granted to more than 30 other states to protect the integrity of one person, one vote through a common-sense voter ID law.""The brief order noted that three of the court's conservatives, including Chief Justice John Roberts, would have allowed the voter identification provision and limits on early voting to be in effect for the election. Justice Clarence Thomas agreed on that point, but was the only justice to say he would have also allowed a requirement blocking pre-registration of 16-year-olds to stay in place.McCrory's lawyers said the status quo should be maintained so close to the election, citing court precedent in their favor. 
The Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on July 29 that the law intentionally discriminated against minority voters. The same court refused to put its decision on hold for the Nov. 8 election.Critics say such laws, passed in Republican-governed states, make voting harder for minorities such as African-Americans and Hispanics, who tend to support Democrats. Backers say the laws are necessary to prevent voter fraud.
The court is currently short one justice following the death of conservative Antonin Scalia in February, which likely deprived the conservative justices of the fifth vote they needed to grant the request.The high court could yet be asked to weigh in on other voting restrictions ahead of the election, with several cases pending in lower courts.
