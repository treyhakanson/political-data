By Jonathan Allen

 (This Sept. 13 story corrects bureau's name to Federal Bureau of Investigation in paragraph 6, not Federal Bureau of Information)By Jonathan AllenNEW YORK Two computer technicians declined to answer questions from U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday about the unauthorized private email system that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton used during her tenure as U.S. secretary of state.Paul Combetta and Bill Thornton repeatedly invoked their constitutional right not to incriminate themselves during about 10 minutes of questioning while under oath before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. A third technician, Bryan Pagliano, declined even to appear, despite a subpoena ordering his testimony.The investigation of Clinton's email system has become a troublesome issue for her presidential campaign, with Republican rival Donald Trump saying a recent finding by federal investigators that she mishandled classified government secrets in her email should disqualify her from office.Brian Fallon, a Clinton campaign spokesman, said in a statement it was up to the technicians whether to cooperate, ""but we certainly are not prevailing upon anyone to cooperate with this sham of an inquiry.""Clinton has said she regrets using the system in her New York home's basement for work. Voters have said in surveys the decision contributes to a feeling she is untrustworthy.
Federal Bureau of Investigation director James Comey said in July there was evidence that Clinton and her staff may have broken the law with their ""extremely careless"" handling of classified government secrets, but concluded there were insufficient grounds to prosecute.Combetta and Thornton work for Platte River Networks, the Denver technology firm that managed Clinton's email servers soon after she left the State Department in 2013. They repeatedly invoked their Fifth Amendment protection from self-incrimination to each question from lawmakers. Jason Chaffetz, the committee's Republican chairman, eventually excused them out of what he called ""respect"" for their rights.Elijah Cummings, the committee's most senior Democratic member, expressed sympathy for the technicians, saying the Republicans were only trying to use them to embarrass Clinton.
Chaffetz criticized Pagliano, who was paid by Clinton to manage her server while she was the nation's top diplomat, for not complying with the subpoena and said the committee would decide after the hearing whether to punish him. Pagliano was given a form of immunity from prosecution in 2015 for cooperating with the FBI as it looked into the mishandling of classified information over the server, but has otherwise cited the Fifth Amendment in declining to provide information to lawmakers. His attorney did not respond to questions.A fourth witness, Justin Cooper, testified for more than two hours about his role setting up the email system in 2009 while he worked a Clinton family aide.
Clinton used an AT&T email account while a senator and a presidential candidate in 2008. Cooper said there was ""a desire to change her email address because a number of people had received her email address over the course of those activities.""A summary of the FBI's findings showed Combetta saying he used software called BleachBit to delete an archive of Clinton's work emails around the same time as a conference call with Clinton's lawyers, despite lawmakers seeking the records through a subpoena.

The Obama Administration plans to increase the number of refugees admitted to the United States by 30 percent in fiscal year 2017, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited an annual refugee report submitted to Congress. Secretary of State John Kerry presented the new target of 110,000 in the 2017 fiscal year starting Oct. 1, up from 85,000 in 2016, during a closed session to members of the House and Senate judiciary committees on Tuesday, according to the newspaper. 
Kerry has said repeatedly over the past year that the United States would admit at least 100,000 refugees in fiscal 2017 and try to admit more if it were able.

By Michael Flaherty
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Billionaire investor Carl Icahn continued to throw his support behind the Republican U.S. presidential candidate on Tuesday, saying Donald Trump would reduce the regulation of U.S. companies.Icahn also said that nutrition and weight management company Herbalife would be a strong candidate to go private, saying such a move would allow it to avoid the kind of criticism aimed at it from Pershing Square hedge fund founder William Ackman.""If you look ahead three years, this economy will be a lot better if Trump gets elected"" rather than Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, Icahn said, speaking at the CNBC ""Delivering Alpha"" event in New York.Trump has said that Icahn would be a great U.S. Treasury secretary though whether the 80-year-old hedge fund manager would commit to such a role remains unclear.
Icahn expressed his frustration at U.S. regulators on Tuesday, specifically the Environmental Protection Agency which he says has neglected to speak to him about his concerns regarding ethanol blending requirements for the fuel refineries in his investment portfolio.Icahn said that fear of ""irrational"" government regulations are a main reason why chief executives are not re-investing in their businesses and instead buying back stock. Trump would aim to reduce such regulations, Icahn said. 
Icahn also addressed his ongoing feud with Ackman, who in 2012 claimed Herbalife was running a pyramid scheme, and made a huge wager against the stock. Icahn emerged later as a buyer of the shares.Herbalife settled a probe of its sales practices with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in July. Icahn has continued buying shares, and the feud with Ackman has continued. 
""I think that Herbalife is certainly a candidate to go private. In fact, frankly, wearing my shareholder hat, I think Herbalife is a lot better private and getting away from this Ackman-type criticism,"" Icahn said at the CNBC event. ""Ackman is out there driving everybody crazy, which is his right to do. He's obsessed with this.""An Ackman spokesman did not immediately return an email seeking comment.

MOSCOW The Kremlin said on Wednesday it viewed U.S. President Barack Obama's recent statements on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as anti-Russian and said they were unlikely to improve fragile relations between Russia and the United States.Obama on Tuesday strongly criticized Trump for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin and for appearing on a TV channel, RT, funded by the Russian government.""Unfortunately, we see continued displays of often hard-core Russophobia,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, commenting on Obama's intervention, told a conference call with reporters. ""We can only express regret in this regard.
""This rhetoric, which is being formulated in electoral campaign style ... is unlikely to help fledgling fragile attempts to build at least some sort of mutual trust.""

By Ayesha Rascoe and James Oliphant
| PHILADELPHIA

PHILADELPHIA With Hillary Clinton sidelined by pneumonia, President Barack Obama took up the Democrats' fight against Donald Trump on Tuesday, trying to quash the Republican presidential candidate's bid to appeal to working-class voters.Obama, whose 50 percent job approval rating could help improve the climate for the Democratic ticket in the Nov. 8 election, rallied party faithful against Trump, the 70-year-old New York real estate developer, at an outdoor event in Philadelphia.""This is a guy who spent 70 years on this earth showing no concern for working people. He spent most of his life trying to stay far away from working people. He wasn't going to let you on his golf course,"" Obama said.Obama's campaign appearance was his first as a solo act on behalf of Clinton as he tries to ensure Democrats retain control of the White House once his eight years are over in January.The president lauded new census numbers on income growth as proof that his administration's policies have helped improve the economy, an attempt to undermine Trump's argument that economic woes are deep.""By so many measures, America is stronger and more prosperous than when we started out on this journey together,"" Obama said.Clinton, who was Obama's secretary of state during his first term, rested at her home in the New York City suburb of Chappaqua, as she recovers from pneumonia. She was diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday but she kept it secret until she nearly collapsed on Sunday at a ceremony in Manhattan marking the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.She is to return to the campaign trail on Thursday, her spokesman Nick Merrill said Tuesday evening.Her campaign said in a statement that she will deliver remarks in Greensboro, North Carolina, on Thursday and ""discuss her vision for an America that is stronger together.""
TRUMP ON CHILD CARE
Trump appeared at a campaign event in suburban Philadelphia after Obama departed, touting proposals that would allow families to deduct child-care expenses from their income taxes and establish paid maternity leave for women whose employers do not offer it. The plan, he said, was aimed to bolster working-class and middle-class families. With his daughter Ivanka at his side, Trump also appeared to support equal pay for women, traditionally a core issue for Democrats.  ""We need working mothers to be fairly compensated for their work and have access to affordable quality child care for their work,"" Trump said. 
As he did earlier in the day at a rally in Des Moines, Trump steered clear of mentioning Clinton's illness but stepped up efforts to wring maximum advantage from her controversial comment that his supporters are ""deplorables."" ""While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country,"" said Trump, who has tried to portray the former first lady as out of touch with ordinary Americans.Clinton said in a speech last week that half of Trump's supporters belong ""in a basket of deplorables"" and accused them of being racist and homophobic. She later said she regretted the remark.Trump, who has often bragged about his wealth, has come under fire himself for rhetoric against minorities during his campaign, including describing Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists, suggesting that a judge could not be fair because of his Mexican-American heritage, and proposing a temporary ban on Muslim immigration to the United States.
After struggling in opinion polls in August, Trump has erased most of Clinton's lead in national surveys and is competitive again in many battleground states where the White House race is likely to be decided.    RALLY ARRESTS 
The ""deplorables"" comment featured at a Trump rally in Asheville, North Carolina, on Monday night that saw a resumption of some of the violence that disrupted his events earlier this year. ""Never in history has a major party presidential candidate so viciously demonized the American voter,"" Trump told the crowd. Five people, including a minor, were arrested at the rally and charged with crimes including second degree trespassing and fighting in public, Asheville police said. A man grabbed an anti-Trump protester's neck and punched him during the rally, video from NBC and ABC showed. Police said they also obtained an arrest warrant for the suspect in that incident.

By Curtis Skinner

A British tourist who caused a security scare at a Donald Trump campaign rally in Las Vegas in June by trying to grab a gun from a police officer pleaded guilty on Tuesday to charges of illegal weapon possession and disorderly conduct, court papers showed.Michael Steven Sandford, 20, admitted as part of his plea deal with prosecutors that he had approached a policeman at the event, saying he wanted an autograph from the presidential candidate, then tried to pull the officer's gun from his holster with both hands, the papers said.Sandford, who had by then overstayed his tourist visa by about 10 months, was immediately arrested and removed from the rally.He also acknowledged having visited a Las Vegas gun range the day before the June 18 incident at the Treasure Island casino-hotel, to take shooting lessons with a rented Glock handgun, firing 20 rounds at a paper target, court papers showed.
No mention was made in the plea agreement about whether Sandford intended to harm Trump, then the presumptive Republican nominee in the U.S. presidential race. In the initial June 20 criminal complaint stemming from the incident, prosecutors said Sandford had told a U.S. Secret Service agent he had driven to Las Vegas from California with the aim of shooting Trump.
On June 29, Sandford was charged with felony counts of being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and disrupting government business, but he was not accused of plotting to kill Trump. At Tuesday's hearing in federal court in Las Vegas, Sandford pleaded guilty to those two charges, each of which carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a statement. Sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 13.
Brenda Weksler, one of Sandford's federal public defenders, declined to comment. (Reporting by Curtis Skinner in San Francisco; Editing by Steve Gorman and Richard Chang)"

WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who is recuperating from pneumonia, plans to resume campaigning on Thursday, her spokesman said.Clinton ""has spent the day catching up on reading briefings, making calls"" and watching on television President Barrack Obama's speech at a campaign appearance for the former secretary of state in Philadelphia, spokesman Nick Merrill said on Tuesday.""We will resume campaign travel on Thursday, more details to come,"" he added.
Hours after Clinton, 68, almost collapsed on Sunday at a New York memorial ceremony for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, her doctor said she had been diagnosed with pneumonia two days earlier.Clinton said on Monday that she would rest a few days before resuming her campaign for the Nov. 8 election against Republican Donald Trump.
Clinton said she had ignored doctor's order to rest and had not revealed her diagnosis earlier because ""I just didn't think it was going to be that big a deal.""

NASHVILLE A Tennessee lawmaker was expelled from the state's House of Representatives on Tuesday following accusations of widespread sexual harassment, media reported. Republican state Representative Jeremy Durham was ousted by a vote of 70-2, according to the Tennessean newspaper, which said this was the state's first legislative expulsion since 1980. Durham did not immediately respond to request for comment. The Tennessean reported that Durham said no formal complaint had been filed against him and that he has not been charged with a crime. ""I'm very pleased that the House made the decision it did today. This was good for the taxpayers of the state. It was good for the victims of the state,"" the newspaper quoted House Speaker Beth Harwell as saying.  
A spokeswoman for Harwell's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A report released by Tennessee's attorney general in July accused Durham of inappropriate sexual conduct with 22 women over a four-year period. The report said Durham repeatedly made unwelcome sexual advances toward female legislative staff, interns and lobbyists.
Durham declined to be interviewed by investigators, the report said. His lawyer, Bill Harbison, said at the time that the report was politically motivated and unfair.Harbison could not be immediately reached for comment on Tuesday. 
The chairman of Tennessee's Republican Party, Ryan Haynes, said on Tuesday: ""I am saddened that all of my former colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, have been placed in this terrible position by the reprehensible misbehavior of one individual.""

By Sharon Bernstein
| SACRAMENTO, Calif.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. California Governor Jerry Brown on Tuesday vetoed a bill to end state sales taxes on feminine hygiene products, angering women and advocates who call the taxes unjust.Brown, a Democrat, cited imperatives of fiscal restraint and viable revenue streams in blocking the bipartisan bill, which would have added tampons, sanitary napkins and other menstrual products to a list of necessities such as food and prescription medicines that are exempt from sales tax.Brown also vetoed several similar bills that would have ended certain state taxes for diapers and other items. He said those measures, together with repeal of the tax on feminine hygiene products, would collectively reduce state revenue by $300 million through the coming year.""Each of these bills creates a new tax break or expands an existing tax break,"" Brown said in a statement. ""As I said last year, tax breaks are the same as new spending - they both cost the general fund money.""
State Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia, chief sponsor of the tampon tax relief bill that passed both houses of the state legislature with unanimous support, railed against the veto in a posting on Facebook.""Jerry Brown please #mansplain why it's OK to balance the budget on women's backs?"" she wrote, including a slang portmanteau of ""man"" and ""explain"" that is used to disparage men who talk to women in a manner regarded as condescending or patronizing.
Lawmakers in at least 15 states have introduced measures to abolish their sales taxes on menstrual products. New York repealed its tampon tax in June, joining Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and New Jersey.The movement appeals to Republicans because it would repeal a tax and is favored by Democrats, who say it eliminates an unfair burden on women, especially those living in poverty.
Garcia, the California assemblywoman, said she would press on in seeking repeal, vowing to ""keep pushing until we get it done."" But it was not immediately clear whether a veto override bid was an option.Overriding a veto in California requires a two-thirds vote in both the state Senate and Assembly, and the legislative session ended Aug. 31.
