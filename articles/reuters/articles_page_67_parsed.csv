| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton leads rival Donald Trump by seven percentage points, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national opinion poll taken as the Republican nominee fought off accusations of groping women.The Oct. 7-13 poll released on Friday shows that 44 percent of likely voters support Clinton while 37 percent back Trump.      That was little changed from Tuesday when the Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Trump trailing by eight points. Two more women came forward on Friday with allegations that Trump had groped them, including a contestant on his reality show, ""The Apprentice,"" as the businessman said accusations of sexual misconduct against him were part of a plot to discredit him only weeks from the election.   
Trump's campaign for the Nov. 8 election has been scrambling to recover from the release a week ago of a 2005 video in which he bragged about groping women and making unwanted sexual advances Support for Clinton has been mostly rising in the seven-day tracking poll since the last week of August, when the candidates were drawing about the same level of support.
Since then, Clinton and Trump have faced each other in two heavily watched debates -- contests that Americans believe Clinton won, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll. Former secretary of state Clinton also leads the field in a separate poll question that includes alternative-party candidates. Among likely voters, 44 percent back Clinton, 37 percent support Trump, six percent favor Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and two percent support Jill Stein of the Green Party.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English in all 50 states. The most recent survey includes 2,889 people who are considered likely voters given their registration status, voting history and stated intention to vote. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of two percentage points.National opinion polls have measured support for the candidates in different ways this year, yet most agree that Clinton is leading and that her advantage has strengthened as the election approaches. RealClearPolitics web site, which tracks most major opinion polls, shows Clinton ahead of Trump by an average of seven percentage points.         (Editing by Alistair Bell)"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

By Letitia Stein
| TAMPA, Fla.

TAMPA, Fla. Florida's Supreme Court overturned a new state death penalty law on Friday because it does not require juries to unanimously recommend capital punishment, a ruling with potential implications for ongoing prosecutions and 385 death row inmates.Executions in Florida, home to the nation's second-largest death row, have been on hold since the U.S. Supreme Court in January struck down the state's death penalty sentencing laws.Friday's ruling by Florida's high court marked another step towards death sentence recommendations becoming unanimous jury decisions in all U.S. states. The U.S. Supreme Court's 8-1 ruling invalidated how a judge sentenced Timothy Hurst to death for the 1998 murder of a fried-chicken restaurant manager. It found Florida gave judges powers that juries should wield in determining death eligibility.In response, the Florida legislature this spring rewrote its death sentencing laws, requiring at least 10 of 12 jurors to support capital punishment, instead of a simple majority. 
That law ""is unconstitutional because it requires that only ten jurors recommend death as opposed to the constitutionally required unanimous, twelve-member jury,"" the state's high court found, adding that the law could not be applied to pending prosecutions. ""It's big,"" said Marty McClain, a prominent Florida death penalty attorney involved in one of the cases. ""There is no constitutional death penalty statute in place until it's fixed.""Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi's office said while it is ""reviewing the ruling pending a possible rehearing, juries in current active capital trials must make unanimous decisions in capital cases as to the appropriateness of the death penalty,"" a spokesman said in an email.
Florida's incoming House speaker, Republican Richard Corcoran, said his chamber would consider options and called the ruling an ""effort to subvert the will of the people as expressed by their elected representatives.""Among U.S. states, only Alabama and Delaware also allowed for non-unanimous jury decisions at the time of the high court's ruling. Delaware's top court in August struck down its death penalty statute. The U.S. Supreme Court has directed a review in Alabama.
""This is significant going forward,"" said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, noting that non-unanimous juries in Florida and Alabama imposed a quarter of U.S. death sentences in recent years.Florida's Supreme Court vacated Hurst's death sentence and ordered a new penalty phase hearing. It did not address the retroactivity of its findings for other cases.""There will have to be searching scrutiny in nearly 400 cases,"" Dunham said. (Editing by Bernadette Baum and Andrew Hay)"	[]	[]

By David Brunnstrom
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said in a private speech to bankers three years ago that the United States had warned Beijing it would ""ring China with missile defense"" unless it did more to rein in North Korea's missile program, according to hacked emails.According to a purported Clinton campaign document attached to an email published by Wikileaks, Clinton said in a speech to Goldman Sachs on June 4, 2013, that the message to China had been, ""You either control them, or we're going to have to defend against them.""It was not possible to confirm the authenticity of the leaked email. The Clinton campaign has neither confirmed nor denied the authenticity of hacked emails.The State Department on Friday declined to comment on ""alleged leaked documents."" When asked whether such a message had been delivered to China, an official said it was not department policy to comment publicly on diplomatic discussions.    Although Clinton's reported comments raised a stir in Asia, they are consistent with U.S. efforts to convince China to help restrain North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, which so far have borne little fruit.
According to the hacked email, Clinton said in the speech, which was delivered after she left her position as secretary of state, that Washington could not accept a situation in which North Korea developed an inter-continental ballistic missile able to carry a miniaturized warhead.She said this not only could threaten treaty allies Japan and South Korea, but also theoretically could reach Hawaii and the West Coast of the United States.""We're going to ring China with missile defense. We're going to put more of our fleet in the area,"" Clinton said, according to the email. ""So China, come on. You either control them, or we're going to have to defend against them.""    
China has been angered by plans announced this year by the United States and South Korea to deploy the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system to protect against the threat posed by North Korean missiles.The United States has argued THAAD is not aimed at containing China, but Beijing is concerned that the system's powerful radar would compromise its security.Current U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in February that the United States had made clear that the way to prevent THAAD deployment was to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue.
According to the leaked emails and in other paid speeches, Clinton also praised Chinese leader President Xi Jinping as a ""more worldly, somewhat more experienced"" politician than his predecessor Hu Jintao, and one who had worked to assert his authority over the People's Liberation Army.Clinton said she also told her Chinese counterparts that the United States had as much a claim to the Pacific as China, given that U.S. forces had liberated it in World War Two.China had ""a right to assert themselves,"" but the United States needed to ""push back to create a balance"" to prevent China taking a chokehold on sea lanes and countries bordering the South China Sea, she said.

By Alison Frankel and Dan Levine

 (In this Oct. 13 story, corrects description of legal standard regarding Trump in paragraph 15)By Alison Frankel and Dan LevineDonald Trump hasn't sued a newspaper for libel in three decades, despite the Republican presidential nominee repeatedly threatening to do so over the course of his business career, according to databases of state and federal court records. A lawyer for the New York real estate developer demanded on Wednesday The New York Times retract a story in which two women accused Trump of inappropriately touching them. If the newspaper did not comply, Trump, who says the allegations are fabricated, would ""pursue all available actions and remedies,"" the lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said in a letter. Trump said at a rally on Thursday he was preparing a lawsuit. An attorney for the Times, David McCraw, said the story was of national importance and the paper would ""welcome the opportunity"" to defend it in court.Over the years, media outlets including the Wall Street Journal, the Village Voice, the New York Post and Fortune Magazine have reported receiving similar threats from Trump or his representatives in advance of unflattering articles.However, Trump rarely makes good on those threats, according to a Reuters review of court dockets in the database of online legal research service Westlaw, a unit of Thomson Reuters.      The last time he sued a news organization for libel was apparently in 1984. Trump filed the case after the Chicago Tribune's architecture critic called his proposed 150-story Manhattan skyscraper an ""atrocious, ugly monstrosity.""In 1985, a federal judge in Manhattan dismissed the suit, ruling the critic had a First Amendment right to express his opinion. The skyscraper was never built.In the 32 years since Trump brought that suit, he has not taken similar action against another news organization, although he or his companies have sued at least three individuals and a book publisher. He was successful in one of those cases. 
Book author and former New York Times reporter Timothy O'Brien defeated a Trump libel lawsuit in 2011, after Trump underwent a grueling deposition by O'Brien's lawyers. Trump's suit against O'Brien, which also named O'Brien's publisher, Time Warner Book Group, alleged the author deliberately underestimated the businessman's net worth. A New Jersey state judge found in 2009 that Trump had not established O'Brien's actual malice.""OPENING UP OUR LIBEL LAWS""
    Former Miss Universe contestant Sheena Monnin was hit with a $5 million default judgment after she failed to appear for arbitration in a case in which Trump claimed she falsely denigrated the pageant as ""rigged."" The arbitration judgment was upheld by a federal judge in Manhattan in 2013. The court record indicates the judgment was paid in 2014.
    The same year, a San Diego federal judge ruled Tarla Makaeff, who was lead plaintiff in a class action against Trump University, did not act with malice when she said in letters to her bank and the Better Business Bureau that Trump University engaged in fraudulent business practices. The judge, Gonzalo Curiel, dismissed Trump's defamation claim.    Trump's attorneys, as well as a spokeswoman for his campaign, did not respond to requests for comment on his libel litigation record, including requests for information on any suits the Reuters docket search may have missed.    U.S. courts have routinely deemed Trump a public figure in libel lawsuits. That means he has to show not only that the story is false, but also that the media outlet knew that it was false or published it in ""reckless disregard"" for the truth.If Trump were a private person, he would have to show the paper was negligent in failing to learn the allegations were false, which is a lower standard of proof.The New York Times attorney, David McCraw, wrote that the paper carefully vetted the allegations in the story.
CHANGING LAWS NOT EASY
Any Trump claim will be difficult because Trump's accusers were on the record, said Jane Kirtley, a media law expert at University of Minnesota Law School. That would bolster the newspaper's argument that it didn't act recklessly in publishing their accounts.Trump has vowed to ""open up our libel laws,"" if he wins the presidency on Nov. 8, to make it easier to sue news organizations. In reality, he would not be able to unilaterally change the laws because they are generally governed by individual states and court precedents.Court records show that Trump or his businesses have themselves been sued several times for libel or defamation. Most of those suits, including a complaint by a former tenant of a Trump condominium and another by a former dealer at a Trump casino in Indiana, were dismissed.One defamation suit against Trump survived dismissal, however. Stock analyst Marvin Roffman sued Trump for $2 million in federal court in Philadelphia in 1990, claiming he was fired from his job after publicly predicting the failure of the Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City.Roffman alleged Trump defamed him in critical statements to numerous newspapers and magazines. After a federal judge refused to toss the case, the Trump Organization settled in 1991.An attorney for Roffman declined to comment.

GREENSBORO, N.C. U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Friday accused Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim of trying to help Democrat Hillary Clinton win the Nov. 8 election through his connection to the New York Times.At a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, Trump also again said a variety of women who have accused him of making unwanted sexual advances are making up their stories.Trump said Slim, as a major New York Times shareholder, is helping bankroll what he called the Times' attempt to help Clinton win the presidential election. The Times published a story from two women accusing Trump of groping them.
""They're not journalists,"" Trump said of the Times reporters. ""They're corporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim and foreign corporations.""

MEXICO CITY Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was set to add Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim as a target of his verbal attacks, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. It cited a Trump adviser as saying the candidate would accuse Slim, one of the world's richest people, of helping to generate allegations in the media of sexual misconduct by Trump.Trump will claim that Slim, as a donor to the Clinton Foundation charity and the largest single shareholder in The New York Times, has an interest in helping her White House campaign, the newspaper said.Slim spokesman Arturo Elias told the Journal that the allegations that Mexico's richest man was interfering in the U.S. election were ""totally falseSlim built his multibillion-dollar empire by purchasing troubled companies and turning them around.     Here are some facts about him:* He was born in Mexico on January 28, 1940, the son of a Lebanese immigrant who built a small fortune by purchasing properties at cheap prices during the Mexican Revolution. * He was the world's richest man until a decline in his flagship telephone company America Movil's stock dragged down his fortune. He remains the world's No. 4 billionaire with a fortune of $50 billion, according to Forbes.
* Slim began accumulating New York Times shares in 2008, buying up 6.9 percent. In 2009, he extended a $250 million loan to the paper that was convertible into more shares and he is now the Times' top individual shareholder with 17.35 percent. * Slim is an engineer by profession and graduated from Mexico's public National Autonomous University. He is a die-hard fan of the school's professional league soccer team, Pumas.
* Slim amassed his fortune after buying Mexico's state-run phone monopoly in 1990 and turning it into Latin America's biggest telecommunications company. His investments stretch from banking, mining and media to construction telecoms and oil services.    * In Mexico, where there are strict restrictions on private donations to political campaigns, he has strived to appear neutral in elections. 
* He has made donations to the Clinton's family foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.* Last year, Slim traveled to El Salvador and Peru with Bill Clinton and Canadian mining tycoon Frank Giustra and the three set up a partnership to fund health and employment initiatives. They had launched a $20 million fund to help small businesses in Haiti in 2010.* Slim has lived in the same house for more than 40 years and prefers to drive himself around Mexico City in his old Mercedes.* He is believed to own the largest number of sculptures by Auguste Rodin outside the artist's native France.

By Scott Malone

New Hampshire's Senate race is a dead heat between incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte and Governor Maggie Hassan, polls showed on Friday, with the tight contest showing the limits of the Democrat's attempt to tie her rival to Donald Trump.Hassan at a debate on Friday lashed out at Ayotte for having said for months that she would vote for, but not endorse, Republican presidential nominee Trump, whose White House campaign is struggling to fight off allegations about groping women. Ayotte changed her position following last weekend's release of a video in which Trump made lewd comments about women, saying she could not vote for him.""Senator Ayotte until last Saturday was willing to vote to put Donald Trump in the Situation Room with access to the nuclear codes, and that shows a very concerning lack of judgment,"" Hassan said during a debate on WGIR-AM radio.
""I have renounced Donald Trump's statements on many occasions ... I have clearly stated where I stand on Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. I won't be voting for either of them,"" Ayotte said, adding that she planned to write-in a vote for Trump's running mate, Governor Mike Pence of Indiana.A pair of new polls released Friday and late Thursday showed the New Hampshire race tied.
A MassInc/WBUR poll conducted Monday through Wednesday showed the Republican holding the support of 46 percent of 501 likely voters to Hassan's 45 percent. A UMass Lowell/7 News poll of 517 likely voters found a similarly close result, with Ayotte holding 45 percent support to Hassan's 44 percent. Both gaps were well within the polls' margins of error.But that finding came as the UMass poll showed Clinton extending her lead in the state to a statistically significant 45 percent support ahead of Trump's 39 percent. That poll had a 4.4 percentage point margin of error.
Clinton's stronger lead in a four-way race, which also includes Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green party candidate Jill Stein, suggested that Hassan's effort to tie Ayotte to Trump was proving ineffective with the state's famously independent-minded voters.""Senator Ayotte is a pretty well known commodity and her personality and views are strong,"" said Neil Levesque of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics. ""You have Republicans who don't want to vote for Trump who are going to vote for Hillary but are also going to vote for Kelly Ayotte because they want her as a check and balance on a Clinton presidency.""

By Dustin Volz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A bipartisan group of 48 lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday asked the Obama administration to brief Congress ""as soon as possible"" about a 2015 Yahoo (YHOO.O)  program to scan all of its users' incoming email at the behest of the government.The request comes amid scrutiny by privacy advocates and civil liberties groups about the legal authority and technical nature of the surveillance program, first revealed by Reuters last week. Custom software was installed to search messages to hundreds of millions of accounts under an order issued by the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.""As legislators, it is our responsibility to have accurate information about the intelligence activities conducted by the federal government,"" according to the letter, organized by Republican Representative Justin Amash of Michigan and Democratic Representative Ted Lieu of California.""Accordingly, we request information and a briefing as soon as possible for all members of Congress to resolve the issues raised by these reports.""Investigators searched for messages that contained a single piece of digital content linked to a foreign state sponsor of terrorism, sources have told Reuters, though the nature of the content remains unclear.
Intelligence officials said Yahoo modified existing systems used to stop child pornography and filter spam messages on its email service. But three former Yahoo employees told Reuters the court-ordered search was done by a module buried deep near the core of the company's email server operation system, far below where mail sorting was handled.
The Senate and House intelligence committees were given a copy of the order when it was issued last year, sources said, but other members of Congress have express concern at the scope of the email scanning.Some legal experts have questioned the breadth of the court order and whether it runs afoul of the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches.Half of registered U.S. voters believe the Yahoo program violated the privacy of customers, according to a poll of 1,989 people conducted last week by Morning Consult, a polling and media company.
Twenty-five percent were supportive of the program because of its potential to stop criminal acts, the survey found, while another quarter did not know or had no opinion.The congressional letter is addressed to Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.

SHANGHAI World number one Novak Djokovic hopes Nick Kyrgios can learn some ""life lessons"" after the Australian was fined by the ATP Tour for breaching its code of conduct during a contentious defeat at the Shanghai Masters.The Australian was beaten 6-3 6-1 by Mischa Zverev in a second-round match on Wednesday in which he put in a series of half-hearted serves and appeared to be walking off court before the unseeded German had completed his shot.The 21-year-old, who has had a number of scrapes with tennis authorities over his behavior in the past, also clashed with spectators before being booed off the court and was subsequently fined $16,500 by the ATP for his behavior.Speaking at the same tournament on Thursday, Djokovic described Kyrgios as one of the greatest talents that the game has seen lately, and said he hoped the Australian would stop squandering his gifts.""He's got huge potential, huge game,"" Djokovic added.
""I mean he's been doing well, he's around 15 in the world so you've got to give him credit for that, but on the other hand he obviously has life lessons to learn and he's still relatively young and hopefully that is going to happen.""World number two Andy Murray said he would be happy to mentor Kyrgios.
""If he ever wanted to talk to me or ask me anything, I would obviously be open to that. You don't want to see young guys who are in the spotlight, struggling and making mistakes, doing things that ultimately hurt them,"" the Briton told reporters.A contrite Kyrgios did apologize via Twitter a few hours after his defeat.
