WASHINGTON U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday attacked the decision by FBI Director James Comey to not recommend charges against Democrat Hillary Clinton for use of a private email server, saying it ""defies explanation.""""Declining to prosecute Secretary Clinton for recklessly mishandling and transmitting national security information will set a terrible precedent,"" Ryan, a Republican, said in a statement. ""The findings of this investigation also make clear that Secretary Clinton misled the American people when she was confronted with her criminal actions.""

| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The FBI will recommend to the Justice Department that no charges be filed over Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state, agency Director James Comey said on Tuesday, lifting a cloud of uncertainty looming over her White House campaign.The agency found evidence of ""extremely careless"" handling of emails by Clinton, and that at least 110 emails contained classified information at the time they were sent, said Comey, announcing the result of a yearlong investigation.But the FBI concluded that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring charges against Clinton, he said.""Although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case,"" Comey told reporters in Washington.His recommendation will likely stand. The country's top prosecutor, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, said on Friday she will accept the recommendations of career prosecutors and the FBI director on whether to charge Clinton for mishandling emails. The FBI probe has dogged the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee's campaign for the past year and has contributed to her low poll ratings on honesty and trustworthiness. Republicans pointed to the controversy as evidence that Clinton considered herself above the law.
Donald Trump, Clinton's Republican rival for the Nov. 8 election, has hammered her on the issue, saying the investigation should disqualify Clinton from being president. On Tuesday, he said the FBI decision was unfair.""The system is rigged,"" he said on Twitter. ""As usual, bad judgment.""The FBI has been investigating whether Clinton broke the law as result of a personal email server kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. One of the questions is whether she mishandled classified information on the server.
Clinton has repeatedly said she never sent or received classified information on her private server. She had a  voluntary 3-1/2-hour interview with the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Saturday in Washington.Comey said, however, there was ""evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information."" But he said the FBI did not find that Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate the law, and there was no ""intentional misconduct"" by her lawyers who sorted her emails.
He said her staff should have known the server was in an improper place for her emails.Comey also said there was no evidence that anyone had hacked Clinton's communications, although it was possible.Republican lawmakers have called for an independent investigation, saying they do not trust the Justice Department to handle the inquiry with impartiality.Republican criticism increased after Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, met privately with Lynch last week. Lynch later said she regretted the meeting and the two did not discuss the investigation. (Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Frances Kerry)"

U.S. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Tuesday he was still troubled by Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email server when she was secretary of State, even though the FBI has declined to recommend charges in the matter.""This is still very troubling,"" McCarthy, the No. 2 House Republican, told reporters, adding that there was no way to know whether Clinton's email server was ever successfully hacked.

| LOS ANGELES

LOS ANGELES Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has hired two people with close ties to U.S. organized labor to try to lock down support from union members as Republican candidate Donald Trump makes courting working-class voters central to his campaign.     The two new staffers, Lori D'Orazio and Michele Gilliam, are to be deputy labor campaign directors, according to a campaign aide. D'Orazio is moving to the campaign from the biggest U.S. labor federation, the AFL-CIO. Gilliam is a former staffer for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who was Clinton's fiercest primary competitor.
    Clinton and Sanders battled fiercely over union support during the Democratic primary, with Clinton, the presumptive nominee, ultimately securing the bulk of the national endorsements from labor unions. But she will need to harness the on-the-ground manpower of unions in crucial battleground states ahead of November's general election match-up with the populist presumptive Republican nominee, Trump. The aide said the campaign is counting on D'Orazio and Gilliam to do just that.Although organized labor is a traditionally Democratic constituency, Trump has made a play to win over rank-and-file union members by criticizing international trade deals such as the pending Trans Pacific Partnership, which labor opposes. Even so, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka warned last month when the federation endorsed Clinton that a Trump presidency would be disastrous for U.S. workers and vowed to mobilize the group's resources to defeat him. 
The AFL-CIO is the largest U.S. federation of labor unions that collectively represent more than 12 million workers. Before joining the AFL-CIO, D'Orazio worked for another large U.S. union, the United Auto Workers, and Gilliam once served as an organizer for a local chapter of the Transport Workers Union.

By Emily Flitter
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Monday defended a social media post he made two days earlier that included an image depicting Democratic rival Hillary Clinton against a backdrop of cash and a Star of David, while Clinton called the image anti-Semitic.In a tweet on Monday, Trump said he had not meant the six-pointed star to refer to the Star of David, which is a symbol of Judaism. Rather, he said, the star could have referred to a sheriff's badge, which is shaped similarly except for small circles at the ends of each of its six points, or a ""plain star.""The presumptive Republican nominee later released a statement saying Clinton's criticism of the image was an attempt to distract the public from ""the dishonest behavior of herself and her husband.""He was referring to a heavily criticized private meeting last week between former President Bill Clinton and U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch as an investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state nears a conclusion.His tweet came after Mic News reported on Sunday that the image attacking Clinton - which included the words: ""History made"" and, inside the star, ""most corrupt candidate ever!"" - had been shared on a neo-Nazi web forum called /pol/. Reuters confirmed the image was posted there on June 22 by viewing a link to an archived version of a /pol/ page, although the page has since been updated and the image removed.""Donald Trump's use of a blatantly anti-Semitic image from racist websites to promote his campaign would be disturbing enough, but the fact that it's a part of a pattern should give voters major cause for concern,"" Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said in a statement emailed to reporters on Monday. 
The Nazis forced Jews to wear a Star of David on their clothing to identify themselves during the Holocaust.'DISHONEST MEDIA'

Trump posted and deleted the tweet on Saturday, then tweeted a similar image in which the star was replaced by a circle. On Monday, he lashed out at journalists for continuing to report on the original tweet.""Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star, or plain star!"" Trump wrote on Twitter.Saturday's incident was the latest departure by Trump from a recent effort to appease Republicans worried about his brash public persona by trying to appear more restrained. The Republican convention, where Trump is expected to be named the party's nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, is two weeks away.
In June, Trump fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and began using a teleprompter to make speeches, hoping to show his campaign could be more inclusive after he aroused controversy by referring to some Mexicans crossing the U.S. border illegally as ""rapists,"" and his mocking of a disabled reporter, which Clinton has begun using in attack ads against him.Ed Brookover, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said in an interview on CNN on Monday that the campaign felt it had ""corrected"" the issue about the star by deleting Trump's original tweet. Brookover said the image's earlier appearance on the neo-Nazi forum was irrelevant. ""These images get posted and reposted and reposted on social media on many forums,"" he said. ""There was never any intention of anti-Semitism."" (Reporting by Emily Flitter; Editing by Leslie Adler and Peter Cooney)"

WASHINGTON Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump met with U.S. Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa on Monday, feeding speculation she could be on the short list for consideration as his vice presidential running mate, Fox News reported.Ernst told the network that she and the New York real estate mogul had a ""good conversation.""""I will continue to share my insights with Donald about the need to strengthen our economy, keep our nation safe, and ensure America is always a strong, stabilizing force around the globe,"" she said.Trump had tweeted that he would meet Ernst in New Jersey. ""She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!"" he said.
Trump met with Indiana Governor Mike Pence, also mentioned as a potential running mate, and his wife on Saturday.Republican sources have told Reuters that former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie top Trump's vice presidential short list.
Other names to watch included U.S. Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Governor Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, the sources said.

By Josh Smith
| KABUL

KABUL The international military mission in Afghanistan will fail if troop levels are reduced further, with potentially dangerous repercussions for the rest of the world, a delegation of U.S. lawmakers warned during a visit to Kabul on Monday.Fifteen years after an American-led operation toppled the Taliban in response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, President Barack Obama is considering whether to maintain the current level of 9,800 U.S. troops or reduce it to 5,500 by the end of the year, as current plans call for.""I cannot guarantee success if we keep 9,800, but I can ensure you failure if we go to 5,500,"" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters in Kabul.""I will have a hard time supporting our continued presence here as it's not fair to those left behind... They just can't do the job. If we go to 5,500 this place will fall apart, quickly.""
Graham joined U.S. senators John McCain, Benjamin Sasse, and Joe Donnelly in a visit timed so the bipartisan delegation could visit with troops during the Independence Day holiday.The Obama administration should decide on troop levels ""sooner rather than later,"" McCain said, arguing that reducing the number of troops could lead to a repeat of the disaster in Iraq, where Islamic State militants seized major cities and wide swathes of territory.McCain, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, sharply criticized the White House's decision last year to restrict U.S. forces from targeting Taliban fighters except in self-defense and other limited circumstances.
Those rules were recently relaxed on the recommendation of American commanders in Kabul, but McCain said it was ""almost criminal"" that the restrictions were in place for more than a year.""The rules of engagement were so restrictive that it gave an advantage to the Taliban and other terrorist groups,"" the senator said.
The lawmakers highlighted Afghanistan's history as one of the original havens for al Qaeda terrorists and pleaded for more patience.""Ultimately we're going to win this fight, it's just going to take decades,"" Sasse said. ""The American people well understand that staying partnered with a good ally like the Afghan government is the best way to deny future safe havens to those who would plot jihadi attacks across the globe.""

By Emily Flitter
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Top lawmakers from both major U.S. political parties said on Sunday they trusted the Justice Department to appropriately handle its probe of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's private email server, after a heavily criticized meeting between Clinton's husband and the U.S. attorney general.Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain said on CBS show ""Face the Nation"" that they would respect Attorney General Loretta Lynch's decision on whether to prosecute Clinton, the likely Democratic presidential nominee. Congressman Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, also said he respected the process, though he acknowledged Lynch's private meeting last week at an airport with former President Bill Clinton was unfortunate.""I think both of them wish their airplanes had never come anywhere near each other,"" Schiff said on ""Face the Nation,"" adding that he still had confidence in the DOJ and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to do a thorough investigation of Clinton's email use.""If they say they are going to conduct this investigation by the book, I believe that's what's going to happen,"" said Schiff, who supports Clinton for the party's nomination.
Lynch said on Friday that she would accept whatever recommendations the career prosecutors working on the case made about whether to prosecute Clinton.The lawmakers' endorsement for the process follows Clinton's meeting Saturday with investigators at the FBI's Washington headquarters, where she answered questions for three and a half hours as part of the probe into use of her private email server.The FBI is investigating Clinton's email use and whether laws were broken as a result of a personal email server kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.
Lawmakers and political strategists speculated on Sunday that the FBI's interview of Clinton signaled its investigation could be nearing its end. But the FBI offered no information about the status of the probe or who its targets may be. Clinton has long insisted she is not a target.Clinton herself said in comments to MSNBC on Saturday that she ""was pleased to have the opportunity to assist the department in bringing its review to a conclusion.""Her rival, presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, said it was ""impossible"" for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against her. The two have already begun an acrimonious battle ahead of the presidential election on Nov. 8.
Democrats are hoping the issue will be resolved before their four-day convention in Philadelphia that begins July 25, which is expected to culminate with Clinton's nomination for the presidential race.It is unclear what Democrats would do if Clinton were to be indicted and if any contingency plan exists.  Not all lawmakers said they were confident the Justice Department could maintain impartiality. Tom Cotton, a Republican senator, said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday he thought Lynch's meeting with Bill Clinton ""raises questions about political interference in this investigation.""
