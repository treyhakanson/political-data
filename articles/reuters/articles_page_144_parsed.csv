| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton held a 6- percentage-point lead over Republican rival Donald Trump, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll with new wording that was released on Friday, the day after she formally accepted her party's nomination for the Nov. 8 election.Nearly 41 percent of likely voters favor Clinton, 35 percent favor Trump, and 25 percent picked ""Other,"" according to the new July 25-29 online poll of 1,043 likely voters, which overlapped with the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.The poll has a credibility interval of 4 percentage points.DON'T MISS:McCain slams Trump over attack on dead Muslim soldier's parents

The presidential tracking poll reflects a slight change of wording from previous surveys, replacing the ""Neither/Other"" option given to respondents with just ""Other."" An internal review had found the word ""Neither"" has, at times, siphoned support away from one or the other candidate.Former Secretary of State Clinton delivered an upbeat keynote address at the Democratic convention on Thursday night, as she became the first woman to accept the presidential nomination from a major party.In the biggest speech of her more than 25-year-old career in the public eye, Clinton, 68, cast herself as a steady leader at a ""moment of reckoning"" for the country, and contrasted her character with what she described as Trump's dangerous and volatile temperament.
Trump, a 70-year-old New York businessman and former reality TV show host who has never held political office, responded in a Twitter post late on Thursday that ""Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.""Both candidates were on the campaign trail on Friday, kicking off what is expected to be a hotly contested general election battle.A separate Reuters/Ipsos survey that provided respondents with the option to choose from Clinton, Trump, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, has Clinton and Trump tied at 37 percentage points.Of the alternative party candidates, Johnson came in third with 5 percentage points, followed by Stein at 1 percentage point, according to the July 25-29 survey of 1,426 likely voters, which has a credibility interval of 3 percentage points."

By Amanda Becker

PITTSBURGH, Pa. - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton toured the U.S. Rust Belt on Saturday, promising to reject bad international trade deals during a factory visit and securing the endorsement of investor Mark Cuban at a Pittsburgh rally.The Dallas Mavericks owner, who said as recently as last month that there was a ""good chance"" he would vote for Donald Trump, instead criticized the Republican nominee's leadership in front of an energetic crowd.""Leadership is not yelling and screaming and intimidating,"" Cuban said.""You know what we call a person like that in Pittsburgh? A jagoff!"" Cuban added, using disparaging Pittsburgh slang.Cuban had spoken with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta several times in recent weeks and called him on Thursday to say he was ready to endorse Clinton, a campaign aide said.Clinton, along with her running-mate Tim Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia, is on a three-day tour of Pennsylvania and Ohio after becoming the first woman to accept a major U.S. party's presidential nomination at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia on Thursday.
Pennsylvania and Ohio are two states in the U.S. Rust Belt that are dealing with job losses caused by the decline in U.S. manufacturing. Neither leans heavily in favor of either political party but both voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012. Trump has zeroed in on white, working-class voters in the region as critical to his campaign and plans to visit both states early next week. In a visit earlier on Saturday to Johnstown Wire Technologies in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Clinton told the largely union crowd there that she would create good-paying jobs by investing in infrastructure and reject a pending Asia trade deal that has become a flashpoint in the U.S. presidential campaign.""We are going to say 'no' to unfair trade deals, we're going to stand up to China,"" Clinton said. 
""I feel strongly about this and I need your help,"" she added.The pending Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiated by President Barack Obama has drawn criticism from both Clinton and Trump.Clinton says it does not do enough to protect U.S. workers. Trump has said he would rip it up and questioned whether Clinton would keep her stance if she wins the Nov. 8 presidential election.
Leo Gerard, the president of the United Steelworkers, which represents roughly 200 of the 260 workers employed by Johnstown Wire Technologies, assured the crowd in his introduction of Clinton that Republicans have been ""telling lies"" about Clinton's stance on the deal. Cambria County, where Johnstown Wire Technologies is based, is 94-percent white and has a median household income of $42,000.Clinton and Kaine will continue their jobs-focused tour that began in Philadelphia, continuing on to Youngstown and Columbus. They are trying to contrast their plan to use infrastructure investments to create jobs with that of Trump, whom Clinton said Friday has a ""downbeat vision of America.""""We are visiting places that prove what Americans can do,"" Clinton said in Johnstown. ""This country and our people have what it takes to get ahead and stay ahead if they have the leadership that gives us that chance.""

By Mark Hosenball, Joseph Menn and John Walcott
| WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO

WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO A computer network used by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign was hacked as part of a broad cyber attack on Democratic political organizations, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.The latest attack, which was disclosed to Reuters on Friday, follows two other hacks on the Democratic National Committee, or DNC, and the party's fundraising committee for candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives.A Clinton campaign spokesman said in a statement late on Friday that an analytics data program maintained by the DNC and used by the campaign and a number of other entities ""was accessed as part of the DNC hack.""""Our campaign computer system has been under review by outside cyber security experts. To date, they have found no evidence that our internal systems have been compromised,"" said Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill.Later, a campaign official said hackers had access to the analytics program's server for approximately five days. The analytics data program is one of many systems the campaign accesses to conduct voter analysis, and does not include social security numbers or credit card numbers, the official said.The U.S. Department of Justice national security division is investigating whether cyber attacks on Democratic political organizations threatened U.S. security, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.The involvement of the Justice Department's national security division is a sign that the Obama administration has concluded that the hacking was sponsored by a state, people with knowledge of the investigation said.While it is unclear exactly what material the hackers may have gained access to, the third such attack on sensitive Democratic targets disclosed in the last six weeks has caused alarm in the party and beyond, just over three months before the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.Hackers, whom U.S. intelligence officials have concluded were Russian, gained access to the entire network of the fundraising Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC, said people familiar with the matter, detailing the extent of the breach to Reuters for the first time.Cyber security experts and U.S. officials said earlier this week they had concluded, based on analysis of malware and other aspects of the DNC hack, that Russia engineered the release of hacked Democratic Party emails to influence the U.S. presidential election.The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Friday it was ""aware of media reporting on cyber intrusions involving multiple political entities, and is working to determine the accuracy, nature and scope of these matters.""""The FBI takes seriously any allegations of intrusions, and we will continue to hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace,"" the agency said in an emailed statement.
The hack did not involve the private email system Clinton used while she was secretary of state.Yahoo News reported on Thursday night that the FBI had warned the Clinton campaign last March that it was a target of a cyber attack involving spearphishing and had asked the campaign to turn over sensitive data to help in its investigation, but that campaign lawyers rejected this request as too intrusive. A source familiar with the matter confirmed this account to Reuters. RUSSIAN HACKERS
The new disclosure to Reuters that hackers gained access to the full DCCC network means they would have had access to everything on the network from emails to strategy memos and opposition research prepared to support Democratic candidates in campaigns for the House.The hack of the DCCC, which is based in Washington, was reported first by Reuters on Thursday, ahead of Clinton's speech in Philadelphia accepting the Democratic party's nomination.
Russian officials could not be immediately reached for comment.Several U.S. officials said the Obama administration has avoided publicly attributing the attacks to Russia as that might undermine Secretary of State John Kerry's effort to win Russian cooperation in the war on Islamic State in Syria.The officials said the administration fears Russian President Vladimir Putin might respond to a public move by escalating cyber attacks on U.S. targets, increasing military harassment of U.S. and allied aircraft and warships in the Baltic and Black Seas, and making more aggressive moves in Eastern Europe.Some officials question the approach, arguing that responding more forcefully to Russia would be more effective than remaining silent.The Obama administration announced in an April 2015 executive order that it could apply economic sanctions in response to cyber attacks. 
TRUMP ON EMAILS
The hack on the DNC, made public in June, led to WikiLeaks publishing more than 19,000 emails last weekend, some of them showing favoritism within the DNC for Clinton over U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned on Sunday as a result, creating a rocky start for the party's convention in Philadelphia this week.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday invited Russia to dig up thousands of ""missing"" emails from Clinton's time at the State Department, prompting Democrats to accuse him of urging foreigners to spy on Americans.On Thursday, Trump said his remarks were meant as sarcasm.Earlier in the week, Clinton campaign senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan had criticized Trump and called the hacking ""a national security issue.""Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said on Friday the reported breach showed cyber security is ""a problem wherever Hillary Clinton goes. Hopefully this time there wasn't classified or top secret information that puts American lives at risk.""In Washington, the DCCC said early on Friday it had hired cyber security firm CrowdStrike to investigate. ""We have taken and are continuing to take steps to enhance the security of our network,"" the DCCC said. ""We are cooperating with federal law enforcement with respect to their ongoing investigation.""The DCCC had no additional comment late on Friday. Officials at the DNC did not respond to requests for comment. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat and the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, told CNN on Friday she had not heard about the hack of the Clinton campaign.But she said: ""It wouldn't surprise me. I think it should be pretty clear that both campaigns should be aware that there's a problem out there. Everybody should be cautious.""

By Steve Holland
| COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he was taking the gloves off in his battle against Democrat Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House after taking a scorching from speakers at the Democratic National Convention.Trump wrapped up a five-day, seven-state campaign swing in Colorado on Friday, where for a fifth straight day his supporters chanted ""lock her up"" whenever he brought up Clinton's name.Trump supporters say Clinton deserves to be prosecuted for her handling of U.S. foreign policy as President Barack Obama's first-term secretary of state and for her use of a private email server while in that office.All week Trump has sought to tamp down the chants by stressing that his main goal is to simply beat Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election.But as the crowd chanted the slogan in Colorado Springs, Trump finally relented.""I'm starting to agree with you, frankly,"" he said. ""No more Mr. Nice Guy.""
In Denver later, he changed his tune when he heard the chant.""I'll tell you what I'd rather do, honestly, is just beat her on Nov. 8 at the polls. She would be a disaster,"" he said.Trump was a punching bag at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, which wrapped up Thursday night, as speaker after speaker - including some Republicans - said he lacked the temperament to be president.
Clinton herself said in her acceptance speech that the election represented a ""moment of reckoning"" for the country.In Colorado Springs, Trump got sidetracked by a couple of disputes from last year as he tried to rebut a Clinton campaign ad.That ad uses video clip from Trump's attack on Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly in protest of her questioning of him at a debate of Republican presidential contenders last August when he said afterward that blood was ""coming out of her eyes, coming out of her wherever.""
""I was talking about her nose,"" Trump said in Colorado Springs. ""I wanted to get back on the issue of taxes"" at the debate.Trump also brought up the case of disabled New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, whom Trump seemed to mock publicly in video used by the Clinton ad.Trump said he was depicting the reporter groveling to him.""I didn't know he was disabled. I didn't know it at all. I had no idea,"" he said. (Reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Leslie Adler and Kim Coghill)"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

By Amanda Becker
| HARRISBURG, Pa.

HARRISBURG, Pa. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took her newly energized White House bid on the road on Friday for a tour of crucial ""Rust Belt"" states Pennsylvania and Ohio, but the campaign's focus was clouded by a newly disclosed cyber attack.Reuters on Friday reported that the computer network used by Clinton's campaign, which is based in Brooklyn, had been hacked as part of a broad cyber attack on Democratic political organizations, citing people familiar with the matter.The campaign said a data program maintained by the Democratic National Committee and used by the campaign and other entities was accessed as part of a cyber attack on the DNC. The Clinton campaign said outside experts had found no evidence that its internal systems had been compromised. On Thursday, Reuters reported that the party's fundraising committee for candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives had also been breached, the second such incident after last weekend's leak of DNC emails.Revelations from the DNC emails gave the Democratic convention a rocky start, threatening a bid to reunify the party after a bitter primary campaign.Even so, a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday showed Clinton leading Republican rival Donald Trump by 6 percentage points.Nearly 41 percent of likely voters favor Clinton, 35 percent favor Trump, and 25 percent picked ""other,"" according to the new July 25-29 online poll of 1,043 likely voters, which overlapped with the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.After a speech Thursday night in which she became the first woman to accept a major party's presidential nomination, Clinton launched a three-day bus tour of Ohio and Pennsylvania, which like other Rust Belt states have been hit by the decline in U.S. manufacturing. Clinton and her vice presidential running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, on Friday attended a rally at Philadelphia's Temple University, toured a factory in Hatfield and ended the day in Harrisburg. They will continue onto Ohio on Saturday and Sunday. Clinton is likely to face a tough challenge in such states from Trump, a New York businessman who is trying to win white working-class voters with rhetoric blasting free trade and illegal immigration.
Clinton and Kaine are using the Rust Belt tour to highlight manufacturing successes and discuss how they plan to boost wages for the middle class. In the process they aim to contrast their vision for the country with the one offered by Trump.""If you're looking for a kind of pessimistic, downbeat vision of America, we're not your folks,"" Clinton said in Hatfield. ""We do not buy into that dark, divisive, image that was presented at the Republican convention last week.""Opinion polls show a potentially tight race in Ohio and Pennsylvania, both of which President Barack Obama won in the 2012 election.""The differences are stark,"" Kaine said in Harrisburg.Clinton and Trump are essentially tied in Ohio, where the Republicans held their convention last week, according to an average of polls by RealClearPolitics. Clinton has a lead of 4.4 percentage points in Pennsylvania, the website's average of recent polls showed.Ohio and to a lesser extent Pennsylvania are among a handful of competitive states traditionally viewed as decisive in presidential elections, because they do not lean heavily Democratic or Republican.
TV VIEWERSHIP LOWER FOR CLINTON
In her speech on Thursday, Clinton, 68, a former first lady and U.S. senator, promised to make the United States a country that works for everyone if she is elected.""We are clear-eyed about what our country is up against. But we are not afraid,"" she said. Clinton portrayed Trump as a threat to the country, saying, ""A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.""  Trump, 70, sent out a flurry of comments on Twitter on Friday morning lambasting media coverage of the speech as ""a joke,"" calling the address ""very long and very boring"" and accusing Clinton of wanting to shut down ""coal mines, steel plants and any other remaining manufacturing."" 
He campaigned in another swing state, Colorado, on Friday and was scheduled to visit Ohio next week. The U.S. television audience for Clinton's acceptance speech was smaller than the viewership of Trump's address a week earlier, according to ratings data released on Friday.An estimated 29.8 million people watched Clinton across 10 broadcast and cable networks, Nielsen data showed. Trump drew 32.2 million viewers in his July 21 address at the Republican National Convention.    Economic issues will be crucial as the White House campaign enters its final three-month stretch. The U.S. economy grew by only 1.2 percent in the second quarter, far less than expected, the Commerce Department said on Friday. During the Rust Belt trip, Clinton will detail her pledge to raise wages and create jobs by unveiling a major infrastructure package within the first 100 days of her presidency, and encouraging companies to invest in workers.   The start of the Democratic convention was overshadowed by the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who quit over leaked emails showing party officials favored Clinton over her primary rival Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator of Vermont.Cyber security experts and U.S. officials said on Monday there was evidence that Russia engineered the release of the  emails in order to influence the election. The Kremlin has denied the accusations.Yet another hack came to light on Thursday, when four people familiar with the matter told Reuters that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating a cyber attack against the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which raises money for Democrats running for the U.S. House of Representatives. The DCCC confirmed on Friday that it had been the target of a cyber security incident.

By Dan Whitcomb

A federal judge on Friday struck down a string of Wisconsin voting restrictions passed by the Republican-led legislature and ordered the state to revamp its voter identification rules, finding that they disenfranchised minority voters.U.S. District Judge James Peterson, ruling in a legal challenge to the laws by two liberal groups, said he could not overturn the entire voter ID law because a federal appeals court had already found such restrictions to be constitutional.But Peterson, in his 119-page ruling, said the requirements that Wisconsin voters show either a photo identification or go through a special petition process had unfairly burdened minorities and needed to be reformed or replaced before the November presidential election.""To put it bluntly, Wisconsin's strict version of voter ID law is a cure worse than the disease,"" the judge wrote. Peterson left the voting rules intact for the Aug 9. primary elections for federal, state and local offices, saying to change them less than two weeks in advance would be disruptive. 
But his ruling was expected to impact the November presidential election in Wisconsin, which could prove a crucial battleground state for Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump.Peterson also struck down as unconstitutional limits on in-person absentee voting, residency requirements and a ban on using expired student identification.Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said in a tweet that he was ""disappointed in the decision by an activist federal judge"" and expected to file an appeal.
A spokesman for One Wisconsin Institute, one of the two groups which filed the challenge, hailed Peterson's ruling as ""a huge win not only for the plaintiffs but for democracy itself."" Wisconsin is one of several Republican-led states that have passed such voter ID laws in recent years amid fear of fraudulent voting by illegal immigrants and others. Among the nine states with the strictest laws, insisting on state-issued photo identification for voters, are Georgia, Indiana, Texas and Virginia.
A U.S. appeals court judge earlier this month ruled the Texas law discriminatory. The judge sent the case back to the lower court to examine whether the law had a discriminatory purpose and also asked the court for a short-term fix for the November general election.Republicans say voter ID laws are needed to prevent voter fraud. Democrats say the laws are really intended to make it harder for poor African-Americans and Latinos, who tend to vote Democrat, to vote.

By David Alexander
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Air Force asked industry on Friday for proposals to replace the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile and the nuclear cruise missile as the military moves ahead with a costly modernization of its aging atomic weapons systems.The Air Force said in a statement it expected to award up to two contracts for a new ICBM weapons system, or ground-based strategic deterrent, sometime next summer or fall. It also expected to award up to two contracts in the same time frame for a new nuclear cruise missile, or long-range standoff weapon.Modernization of the U.S. nuclear force is expected to cost more than $350 billion over the next decade as the United States works to replace its aging systems, including bombs, nuclear bombers, missiles and submarines. Some analysts estimate the cost of modernization at $1 trillion over 30 years.The new ICBM system would be a follow-on to the Minuteman missile, whose launch systems and physical infrastructure first became operational in the mid-1960s. The system has been upgraded over the years, but much of the infrastructure is original, the Air Force said.
The most recent versions of the Minuteman III date from the late 1990s and early 2000s and had an intended 20-year life span, the Air Force said. The missile will ""face increased operational and sustainment challenges until it can be replaced,"" it said.""This request for proposals is the next step to ensuring the nation's ICBM leg of the nuclear triad remains safe, secure and effective,"" said Major General Scott Jansson, who leads the Air Force program office for strategic systems.
Opponents of replacing the nuclear cruise missile have argued that its missions could be handled by other legs of the triad. Others say it is an unnecessary expense at a time of shrinking budgets and smaller deployed nuclear arsenals.The military insists the new cruise missile is needed to enable older bombers to deliver nuclear weapons to targets whose air space is heavily defended and difficult to reach with gravity bombs.
The missile is ""needed to replace the aging air launched cruise missile, which has far exceeded its originally planned service life ... and is required to support our B-52 bomber fleet,"" Admiral Cecil Haney, the head of U.S. Strategic Command, told lawmakers earlier this year.

By Jonathan Stempel

A federal appeals court on Friday refused to dismiss a corruption indictment against Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, rejecting the Democrat's claim that the U.S. Constitution shielded him from prosecution.The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said prosecutors could pursue charges that Menendez accepted campaign donations and gifts, including a stay in a Caribbean villa and private jet flights from a wealthy friend, Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, in exchange for using his office to lobby on his behalf.""Members of Congress are not to be 'super-citizens' immune from criminal liability,"" Circuit Judge Thomas Ambro wrote for a three-judge panel of the Philadelphia-based appeals court.Friday's decision means the case could eventually be headed for trial, and could complicate Democrats' efforts to regain control of the U.S. Senate after the Nov. 8 election.If Menendez, 62, were forced to give up the seat he has held since 2006, Governor Chris Christie, a Republican, could under New Jersey law appoint a temporary replacement.The senator has pledged to stay in office while defending himself, but has given up his post as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.Abbe Lowell, Menendez's lawyer, said the senator intends to ask the entire appeals court to review Friday's decision, and, if necessary, appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.The decision is ""another step in the legal process that, at the end of the day, will show that Senator Menendez has always acted in accordance with the law,"" Lowell said in a statement. ""The Senator remains confident that he will be vindicated.""Peter Carr, a U.S. Department of Justice spokesman, declined to comment.
LOBBYING OR POLICYMAKING?
In an indictment unveiled in April 2015, Menendez was accused of accepting bribes from Melgen in exchange for interceding in various matters on his friend's behalf.Prosecutors said these included an $8.9 million Medicare billing dispute, and a contract dispute with the Dominican Republic in which Menendez encouraged the State Department to intervene.Menendez and Melgen have pleaded not guilty to the respective charges they faced in the 22-count indictment.Last September, U.S. District Judge William Walls in Newark, New Jersey, dismissed four bribery counts but left most of the government's case intact.
In his appeal, Menendez argued that his actions were protected by the Constitution's ""speech or debate"" clause, which offers broad protection to members of Congress against prosecution for actions they undertake as legislators.Ambro, however, said Menendez's actions amounted to ""essentially lobbying on behalf of a particular party,"" and thus outside the ""safe harbor"" provided in the Constitution.There is ""a sufficient basis for the district court's conclusion that the predominant purpose of the challenged acts was to pursue a political resolution to Dr. Melgen's disputes,"" Ambro wrote. ""It was not to engage in true legislative oversight or otherwise influence broad matters of policy.""MCDONNELL

Lowell had argued that Walls should have focused on what actually went on at the meetings in question, saying the record reflected that ""high-level policy discussions"" had taken place.Ambro said Menendez remains free to argue that his efforts were directed toward influencing policy, and the government still has the burden at trial of proving otherwise.""The evidence in favor of Senator Menendez will no doubt channel forcefully his position at trial,"" the judge wrote.Friday's decision came one month after the Supreme Court unanimously overturned the bribery convictions of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell.That court said routine political activities such as arranging meetings or reaching out to public officials generally could not form a basis for criminal prosecutions.The 3rd Circuit focused mainly on the speech or debate clause, and did not mention McDonnell. Lowell said that case raised ""important"" issues that need to be addressed.The case is U.S. v. Menendez, 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-3459.
