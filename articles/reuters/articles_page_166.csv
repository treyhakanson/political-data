By Susan Kelly

President Barack Obama on Monday urged Congress to reconsider offering a government-run health insurance option alongside private plans on the exchanges created as part of his national healthcare law. In an article published in the online edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association, Obama said the Affordable Care Act had made much progress toward improving access to healthcare and the quality and affordability of care. Many Republicans fiercely oppose the law saying it has raised health coverage costs for Americans and have tried repeatedly to repeal it in Congress   Obama said several challenges remain. ""Now, based on experience with the ACA, I think Congress should revisit a public plan to compete alongside private insurers in areas of the country where competition is limited,"" the president wrote.    
Public programs like Medicare often deliver care more cost effectively by curtailing administrative overhead and securing better prices from providers, Obama said.Republicans and some Democrats opposed the inclusion of a government-run plan similar to Medicare in the original Obamacare law, and the so-called ""public option"" did not make it into the final legislation.  Since the ACA became law, the uninsured rate has declined  to 9.1 percent in 2015 from 16 percent in 2010. Most enrollees live in counties with at least three policy issuers, which helps keep down costs, Obama said.
However, 12 percent of those enrolled in plans through the exchanges live in areas with only one or two issuers. Adding a public plan in such areas would give consumers more affordable options, he said.Obama also called on Congress to increase financial assistance to purchase coverage, which he said would help middle class families who are stilling struggling with premiums.
Obama said spending on prescription drugs, which rose 12 percent in 2014, remains a problem, and he urged Congress to act on his proposal to increase transparency around manufacturers' production and development costs. He said the federal government should be given the authority to negotiate prices for certain high-priced drugs.Last month, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives unveiled a plan to overhaul the nation's healthcare system that would keep some of Obamacare's more popular provisions, including protections for people with pre-existing conditions and allowing young adults to stay on their parents' coverage until age 26.The proposal, which is not formal legislation, is part of a broader effort by House Speaker Paul Ryan to offer a Republican agenda ahead of the Nov. 8 elections.

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. lawmakers this week will consider three Republican-backed measures targeting the Obama administration's nuclear agreement with Iran, which bitterly divides Washington a year after it was announced and could play a role in November's elections.One bill would impose new sanctions on Iran over any sponsorship of terrorism or human rights violations. Another would bar the purchase from Iran of ""heavy water,"" a non-radioactive byproduct from making nuclear weapons and nuclear energy. The third would block Iran's access to the U.S. financial system, including the use of the dollar.Republican lawmakers, who control the House of Representatives and Senate and unanimously opposed the nuclear deal announced last July 14, have said the measures are necessary to send Iran a strong message that it will face consequences if it violates international agreements.Many, joined by several Democrats, have been especially concerned by Iran's actions since the deal was officially implemented in January, including its test-firing of ballistic missiles in March.""It makes sense to do all we can to check this very dangerous Iranian activity,"" Republican Representative Ed Royce, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told the Rules Committee, which sets up rules for debate of bills headed to the House floor.Thanks in part to the nuclear agreement, Iran has begun to rejoin global politics and economics after more than three decades of isolation. Business and political leaders are visiting the country, which is also hosting trade conferences.In his first report on the deal, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Iran's ballistic missile launches ""are not consistent with the constructive spirit"" of the nuclear deal. He said it was up to the U.N. Security Council to decide if the launches violated the resolution backing the agreement.
However, he also said he was ""encouraged by Iran's implementation of its nuclear commitments.""Republicans worry that President Barack Obama is so eager to preserve the pact as a legacy that his administration will give Tehran too much leeway before he leaves office in January.ELECTION-YEAR POLITICS?

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, backs the nuclear deal. Republican candidate Donald Trump has promised to tear it up if he is elected on Nov. 8.Most of Obama's fellow Democrats in Congress backed the agreement. They say the new legislation is intended to undermine or even derail it.The White House issued a threat on Monday to veto all three bills, saying they would affect the continued viability of the nuclear agreement.The deal ""is critical to ensuring that Iran's nuclear program is and will remain exclusively peaceful, which is profoundly in the national security interest of the United States and the international community,"" it said in a statement.
The bills are not expected to win enough votes to advance in the Senate, even if they pass the House. And if they did pass the Senate, they would lack enough support to override a veto.Backers of the Iran deal said Republicans were trying to appeal to voters just days before the convention where Trump is due to become the party's presidential nominee.Polls show an overwhelming majority of Americans have an unfavorable view of Iran.Dylan Williams, vice president for government affairs at J Street, a pro-Israel group that supported the nuclear deal, said such legislation plays into voters' frustration with what they see as a do-nothing Congress.""This kind of grandstanding not only endangers our security by endangering the deal, it's exactly the type of politics that people are sick of,"" he said.

| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republicans Donald Trump and Chris Christie teamed up on Monday to assail Democratic President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton as weak on domestic security, making the kind of one-two punch possible if Trump picks Christie as his running mate.At a rally in Virginia Beach, Virginia, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, and Christie, the tough-talking New Jersey governor, seized on the Dallas police shootings as examples of why Americans need a ""law and order"" candidate like Trump.Much of the debate about security in the presidential campaign has been about threats abroad. The shooting deaths of five Dallas police officers last week and violence in other cities have shifted the debate back home for now.Trump, a wealthy real estate developer, presented himself as ""the law and order candidate"" and called Clinton weak. He said she has grown out of touch with the plight of ordinary Americans and cited her making paid speeches to corporate interests as a cause.""Perhaps it is easy for politicians to lose touch with reality when they are being paid millions of dollars to read speeches to Wall Street executives, instead of spending time with real people in real pain,"" he said.""The disconnect in America is deep. There are two Americas: the ruling class, and the groups it favors, and then everyone else,"" said Trump.
In the final days of his search for a vice presidential running mate, Trump was introduced at the event by Christie, who is one of Trump's top potential picks to be his vice presidential running mate.Christie, a former rival of Trump for the presidential nomination, showed himself capable of assuming the role of political attack dog, a job the vice presidential nominee usually assumes. He suggested Obama has taken sides against police in the country's debate over race and police brutality.""We need a president who once again will put law and order at the top of the priority of the presidency of this country,"" Christie said. ""Our police officers ... need to understand that the president of the United States and his administration will give them the benefit of the doubt, not always believe that what they have done is somehow wrong.""
Trump has been test-driving his vice presidential possibilities. He campaigned last week with former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, and is to appear with a third No. 2 possibility, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, in Indiana on Tuesday.The New York businessman has appeared most comfortable publicly with Gingrich. Both Gingrich and Christie have been advisers for Trump behind the scenes.Trump is also considering retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn for the job, but told The Washington Post in an interview published on Monday that he is leaning toward a conventional politician.
""I don't need two anti-establishment people,"" Trump said. ""Someone respected by the establishment and liked by the establishment would be good for unification. I do like unification of the Republican Party.""Trump said he would decide on his vice presidential pick in the next three or four days. The Republican National Convention, at which he is to be nominated as the party's candidate, opens in Cleveland next Monday.(This version of the story was refiled to fix typographical error in 4th paragraph to make it ""estate"" instead of ""state"") (Reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"

By Luciana Lopez and Jonathan Allen
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders is set to throw his support behind fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton's bid for the White House on Tuesday, a boost for the former secretary of state as she prepares to face off with Republican rival Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election.An endorsement from Sanders would end a bitterly fought battle for the Democratic nomination that split the party over education, healthcare and climate change, and comes after Clinton offered Sanders a handful of policy concessions on those issues in recent weeks.At a rally in New Hampshire on Tuesday, the pair will appear together to discuss a shared ""commitment to building an America that is stronger together and an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top,"" according to statements released Monday by both campaigns. Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver would not confirm whether Sanders would formally endorse Clinton on Tuesday but said the rally will be the first of many in which Sanders will ""be out there stumping for the Democratic nominee.""Sanders had been under pressure for weeks from Democratic Party officials to throw his weight behind Clinton after she locked up the required number of delegates last month with a string of wins in state-by-state primary contests, but had resisted, citing policy differences.Clinton needs Sanders' supporters to boost her chances against Trump in her run for the White House. Only about 40 percent of Sanders' supporters say they would vote for her, according to recent Reuters/Ipsos polling. 
Weaver said that despite Sanders backing of Clinton, he would likely still press on with his efforts to reform the Democratic Party nominating process after a contentious primary season, pushing to open primaries to independent voters and change the roles of superdelegates, party stalwarts who can support a nominee of their choosing regardless of how people voted in their districts.ROOM FOR FRICTION

In the past few weeks, both camps have been in regular contact on how to bring Clinton closer to some of Sanders' progressive stances on issues like wealth inequality, trade, healthcare, education, and the environment in an effort to unify the party.But some Sanders' supporters are not fully satisfied by Clinton's concessions on the party platform - most of which centered on education and healthcare - suggesting there may be some room for friction at the Democratic National Convention later this month where Clinton is set to be formally nominated.""This is a platform clearly influenced by Bernie Sanders,"" said James Zogby, the president of the Arab American Institute and a Sanders appointee to the party's platform drafting committee.     
But, he added, ""there were several areas where the Clinton campaign lost an opportunity to not only reach out to the Sanders base but to also to make a dramatic statement to the American people in general that would have gone a long way in helping her demonstrate that she will be a different kind of candidate,"" he said. For example, he said, the party could have used stronger language in its policy platform draft to condemn the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which Sanders has argued would hurt American workers and which Clinton has also vocally opposed.Sanders' challenge to Clinton, one of the best-known figures in U.S. politics, lasted far longer than expected, running for four months and across 50 states and yielding record numbers of small donations to his campaign. He has previously vowed to help Clinton defeat Trump but has been reluctant to end his campaign, and has come short of making a formal endorsement even as other prominent Democrats have rallied around her, including President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a favorite of the party's liberal wing. On Monday, the Communications Workers of America endorsed Clinton, after having earlier endorsed Sanders.

WASHINGTON Democrat Baron Hill on Monday announced he was leaving the race for an open U.S. Senate seat in Indiana, clearing the way for a potentially more popular, better-funded Democratic candidate and possibly helping the party's prospects in November's elections.""After consulting with my family, my staff and party leaders, I am withdrawing from the U.S. Senate race and removing my name from the November ballot,"" Hill, a former Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives said in a Facebook post.Media organizations reported that former U.S. Senator Evan Bayh, who also has served as Indiana's governor, would replace Hill on the Democratic ballot in the Nov. 8 election.Bayh was not immediately available for comment, but if he enters the race, he would challenge Representative Todd Young, the Republican nominee.
In announcing his decision, Hill noted that Democrats have a good chance of winning majority control of the Senate, ""especially with a strong nominee who has the money, name identification and resources to win. I do not want to stand in the way of Democrats winning Indiana and the U.S. Senate.""
Bayh, who served two terms in the Senate before retiring in 2010, has nearly $10 million in cash on hand, according to the latest Federal Election Commission filings. According to the FEC, Hill had less than $400,000 cash on hand.

WASHINGTON The Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee said on Monday that President Barack Obama must ask Congress for additional funds to pay the deployment of more troops to Iraq, as Congress and the White House debate defense spending amid mandatory budget cuts.""Added to the President's Afghanistan announcement last week, the United States will now be deploying thousands more troops than we have budgeted for in the President's budget request,"" Representative Mac Thornberry said in a statement.""Those deployments can only be fully supported through a supplemental budget request,"" Thornberry said.
U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced on Monday that Washington would send 560 additional troops to assist Iraqi forces in an expected push on the Islamic State stronghold of Mosul. Obama said on July 6 he would keeping 8,400 troops in Afghanistan through the end of his presidency in January.As the Republican-led Congress and the Democratic administration grapple over spending, Obama has threatened to veto a $602 billion defense policy bill because of its use of special funds for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to avoid mandatory spending limits.
Democrats say the Department of Defense should be subject to the same spending restrictions as non-military programs, but Republicans accuse Democrats of stinting on national security in order to fund pet projects.

By James Oliphant
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The shocking shooting deaths of five Dallas police officers have magnified the challenge that Hillary Clinton faces as she tries to reassure both voters jittery about social unrest and activists angry about law-enforcement abuses that she is on their side.For Clinton, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, the political concerns going forward are two-fold. She can't afford to alienate black and progressive voters she needs to show up in large numbers in the November election by taking too strong a stand against the protests like those recently in Louisiana and Minnesota that resulted in hundreds of arrests. At the same time, Clinton can't allow more moderate voters worried about the violent images on their TV screens to gravitate to her Republican rival, Donald Trump, who has attempted to use the tragedy in Dallas to argue that he is the better law-and-order candidate. Clinton herself recognizes the fine line she is trying to navigate. In remarks Friday following the Dallas sniper attack that left five officers dead, she acknowledged she was sending a mixed message in advocating for reform to curb police misconduct while at the same time praising the honor and bravery of police officers.""I know that, just by saying all these things together, I may upset some people,"" Clinton said in Philadelphia.Polling by Reuters/Ipsos has revealed sharp differences in how Trump and Clinton's supporters view the police when it comes to African-American suspects. Just 24 percent of Trump voters believe that black people are treated worse than whites compared to 55 percent of Clinton voters, according to a poll conducted between May 13 and June 7. African-Americans were also almost twice as likely as whites to describe the police as ""too violent,"" according to Reuters polling.The slain Dallas gunman, Micah Johnson, shot a dozen Dallas officers because he wanted to ""kill white people,"" authorities said.
Prior to the attack, Clinton had tried to demonstrate her solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement after black men were killed by police in a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. ""White people"" need to start listening, she said, ""to the legitimate cries that are coming from our African-American fellow citizens.""Clinton's words were seized upon on Sunday by retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, a top contender to be Trump's vice-presidential pick. Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, called Clinton's comments ""irresponsible"" in an interview with ABC News because she ""talked about white people being to blame.""Trump argued on Twitter Sunday that the United States is a ""divided nation"" due in part to the leadership of Clinton and President Barack Obama. Reports had him now strongly considering Flynn as a running mate in part because of Americans' growing concerns over public safety. 
DEBATE OVER DEATH PENALTY 
But Clinton has also had problems with black activists. Two Black Lives Matter advocates crashed a fundraiser in February, complaining about Clinton's past comments about youth gangs. And in April, protesters sparred with her husband Bill Clinton, the former president, over the 1994 bill he signed into law that put non-violent offenders in prison for longer terms.Clinton has spoken at length about criminal-justice reform and scaling back gun rights, but still is viewed by many progressives, who have increasing sway in the party, as too centrist. Democrats, for example, are expected to formally call for the abolition of the death penalty for the first time at the party's nominating convention later this month. While Clinton has been critical about racial bias in the application of capital punishment, she has come short of saying it should be done away with. Trump has argued the death penalty should be automatic for anyone found guilty of murdering a police officer.
Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist in Florida, said he believes Clinton can find a message that can appease both moderates and liberals on the issue of police violence. ""She can talk to the types of voters who strongly support their local law enforcement, but who also understand there are very troubling stories coming out of certain communities and real issues that need to be addressed,"" he said. Clinton may be able to utilize Vice President Joe Biden, well-liked by law enforcement, as a surrogate to reach out to police groups. Clinton and Biden were scheduled to campaign together Friday, but the event was canceled in the wake of the Dallas incident. However, Biden, as a U.S. senator, was an advocate of the 1994 crime bill that's now the object of scorn among black activists, underscoring the thorny politics of the issue within the party. Trump continues to enjoy the same kind of advantage among white voters that Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, held. The most recent Reuters tracking poll shows Trump leading Clinton among white likely voters by two points, while Trump trails Clinton among all likely voters by 13 points. That makes African-American turnout particularly critical for Clinton. In 2012, Romney won almost 60 percent of the white vote but still lost handily to Obama, who drove minorities to the polls in high numbers.  (Editing by Caren Bohan and Mary Milliken)"
