By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected a request to revive an investigation in Wisconsin into whether Governor Scott Walker's campaign to withstand a union-backed 2012 recall election illegally coordinated with conservative advocacy groups aligned with him.The justices, on the first day of their new term, let stand a 2015 Wisconsin Supreme Court decision to end the probe into whether the Republican governor and conservative groups violated campaign finance laws.The investigation, led by special prosecutor Francis Schmitz, was launched two months after Walker became the first state governor in U.S. history to survive a recall election. Walker last year mounted an unsuccessful bid for his party's presidential nomination.""The United States Supreme Court, the Wisconsin Supreme Court and multiple judges have all reached the same conclusion with every ruling - that this investigation by prosecutors was without merit and thus must be ended,"" Walker said in a statement.Walker last year signed a state law prohibiting prosecutors from using Wisconsin's secret investigation statute, which had been used to convict four of his aides and investigate his campaign, to probe political crimes.
Three Democratic county prosecutors who asked the justices to hear an appeal of the state court ruling expressed disappointment.""The state Supreme Court decision, left intact by today's order, prohibits Wisconsin citizens from enacting laws requiring the full disclosure of disguised contributions to a candidate,"" they said in a statement.That includes money spent by third parties at the direction of a candidate to support that candidate's election, they added.
The investigation focused on possible unlawful coordination between Walker's campaign and conservative groups including the Wisconsin Club for Growth in 2011 and 2012.A federal judge in 2014 initially stopped the probe after the Wisconsin Club for Growth filed a lawsuit accusing investigators of sidelining the group from political activities and violating its rights under the U.S. Constitution to free speech, association and equal protection under the law.A federal appeals court later said the investigation could continue but Wisconsin's high court ultimately stopped it.
Brendan Fischer, a lawyer with the Campaign Legal Center that advocates strong enforcement of campaign finance laws, said the justices' move did not endorse Walker's actions.""Governor Walker secretly told out-of-state donors they could support him by secretly giving to Wisconsin Club for Growth which, he emphasized, could accept corporate contributions without limit,"" Fischer said.""Walker's campaign adviser controlled how Wisconsin Club for Growth spent the money, and after winning re-election, Walker signed legislation advancing the interests of the secret donors.""

WASHINGTON The investigative arm of Congress has agreed to examine whether a panel that oversees foreign investment in the United States has the legal powers it needs to keep up with efforts by state-owned firms in Russia and China to buy strategic U.S. companies.The Government Accountability Office said in a letter to lawmakers released on Monday that it would begin the review in about four months once the staff with the needed expertise were cleared of other duties. The letter was dated Sept. 30.The study is being initiated in response to a request on Sept. 15 by 16 members of Congress, who voiced concern that legislation governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has not been updated enough to ensure the panel can do its job effectively.""Now is an opportune time for GAO to review what has worked well, and where CFIUS authorities may need to be expanded, especially given the rise in state-owned enterprises and state-controlled enterprises from China and Russia, among other designated countries,"" the lawmakers said in their letter.The letter from the lawmakers noted that foreign investment oversight began as an executive order from the president and was only codified by Congress in response to concerns about foreign ownership of defense industries and ports.
The letter said lawmakers were now concerned about recent investments in the telecommunications, media and agriculture sectors that raised questions about ""the degree to which foreign ownership ... may pose a strategic rather than overt national security threat.""It noted that Chinese companies designated by Beijing as ""state champions"" often benefited from illegal subsidies in order to gain strategic access to markets like the United States.
The letter said Congress had raised concerns about China National Chemical Corp's (ChemChina) CNNCC.UL planned $43 billion acquisition of Swiss agricultural seed and pesticides provider Syngenta AG (SYNN.S) and to Dalian Wanda Group's bid for major American movie studios like Legendary Entertainment and Paramount Studios.It said the media acquisitions were particularly concerning because of ""China's efforts to censor topics and exert propaganda controls on American media.""
""These examples raise serious security questions about what authority CFIUS currently has, or may need to be added, to address these concerns,"" the lawmakers said in their letter. (Reporting by David Alexander; Editing by Diane Craft)"

DUBAI Saudi Arabia said on Monday that a U.S. law allowing citizens to sue the kingdom over the Sept. 11 2001 attacks represented a threat to international relations and urged Congress to act to prevent any dangerous consequences from the new legislation.The cabinet, at its weekly meeting in the capital Riyadh, also said that the law, known as JASTA, represented a violation of a leading principle preventing lawsuits against governments that regulated international relations for hundreds of years.""Weakening this sovereign immunity will affect all countries, including the United States,"" the statement by Saudi Information Minister Adel al-Toraifi, carried by Saudi state news agency SPA, said.""(The cabinet) expressed hope that wisdom will prevail and that the U.S. Congress would take the necessary steps to avoid the bad and dangerous consequences that may result from the JASTA legislation,"" it added.
The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly last Wednesday to approve legislation that will allow the families of those killed in the 2001 attacks on the United States to seek damages from the Saudi government.Fifteen out of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals.    Riyadh has always dismissed suspicions that it backed the attackers, who killed nearly 3,000 people under the banner of Islamist militant group al-Qaeda. 
Riyadh is one of Washington's longest-standing and most important allies in the Middle East and part of a U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.The Saudi government lobbied strongly against JASTA, which stands for the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act,  in the run-up to the vote, and warned it would undermine the principle of sovereign immunity.
But Saudi officials stopped short of threatening any specific retaliation if the law was passed. (Reporting by Sami Aboudi; Editing by William Maclean/Jeremy Gaint)"

By Alana Wise
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Donald Trump's decision to take a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax return showed his business acumen and ""genius"" at figuring out how to minimize his tax bill, two of the Republican presidential candidate's advisers said on Sunday.""This is a perfectly legal application of the tax code. And he would have been fool not to take advantage of it,"" said Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor who is one of Trump's advisers.Speaking on the ABC program ""This Week,"" Giuliani said that as a business owner, Trump has a ""fiduciary duty"" to the investors in his real estate company to maximize profits.Giuliani compared Trump's ability to come back from the nearly $1-billion loss to turnarounds made by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and Winston Churchill, the former British prime minister who led the United Kingdom through World War Two.""It shows what a genius he is. It shows he was able to preserve his enterprise, and then he was able to build it,"" Giuliani said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""The New York Times reported on Saturday that it had obtained Trump's 1995 tax records and it quoted experts as saying that the $916 million loss he reported for that year may have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years.
Susanne Craig, one of the Times reporters who was bylined on the story about Trump's tax records, said the tax documents arrived in a manila envelope in her mailbox at the Times with a return address of the Trump Organization.She said a lawyer for Trump had threatened the newspaper with legal action if it decided to publish the documents.The tax benefits outlined in the documents stemmed from financial deals Trump made that went bad in the early 1990s.The Trump campaign, in a statement on Saturday, said the tax document was obtained illegally and accused the New York Times of operating as an extension of the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, Trump's rival in the Nov. 8 election.
""I know our complex tax laws better than anyone who has ever run for president and am the only one who can fix them. #failing@nytimes,"" Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday.Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor and head of Trump's presidential transition team, said that Trump's records showed that the U.S. tax code was an ""absolute mess"" and that Trump was the best person to fix it.""There's no one who has shown more genius in their way to maneuver about the tax code as he rightfully used the laws to do that,"" Christie said on ""Fox News Sunday.""
But Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said the tax writeoff ""shows the colossal scale of his business failures"" and that the wealthy real estate developer operates under a different set of rules than ordinary taxpayers.Clinton has repeatedly called on Trump to release his tax returns, as is standard procedure for modern presidential candidates.Trump has declined to release his tax records, saying he will not do so until an audit of his returns by the Internal Revenue Service is complete.The IRS has said that an audit does not bar an individual from sharing their own tax information.

By Amanda Becker
| CHARLOTTE, N.C.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. Hillary Clinton told a majority-black church in North Carolina on Sunday that she knows her grandchildren are growing up in a different world than many black youth in the U.S. who are concerned about police shootings and gun violence in their communities.The Democratic presidential nominee's remarks at the Little Rock AME Zion Church in Charlotte were a frank acknowledgment of the impact of what she has called ""implicit bias"" in policing can have on black communities.Clinton cited the death of 43-year-old Keith Scott, a black man who was shot by police in front of a Charlotte apartment complex on Sept. 20. She also lamented the death of 40-year-old Terence Crutcher, who was shot days before during a Tulsa traffic stop. Both shootings led to community protests. The Tulsa police officer has pleaded not guilty to a manslaughter charge.""I'm a grandmother, and like every grandmother, I worry about the safety and security of my grandchildren, but my worries are not the same as black grandmothers, who have different and deeper fears about the world that their grandchildren face,"" Clinton said.
Clinton described testimony that Taje Gaddy, 10, and Zianna Oliphant, 9, gave last week before the Charlotte City Council about violence in their community. Clinton later summoned Oliphant to join her on the stage.""I wouldn't be able to stand it if my grandchildren had to be scared and worried the way too many children across our country feel right now. But because my grandchildren are white, because they are the grandchildren of a former president and secretary of state, let's be honest here, they won't face the kind of fear that we heard from the children testifying before the city council,"" Clinton said.
Clinton has made gun violence a focus of her presidential campaign. Mothers who have lost children in shootings have joined her on the campaign trail. Clinton has said police officers should be trained to recognize implicit bias and called for the official police video of the Charlotte shooting to be released.Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, said at a rally after Crutcher's shooting that it looked like he had done ""everything he was supposed to do.""  On Twitter, he criticized Clinton's trip to Charlotte, which was postponed one week at the behest of the city's mayor, as a chance to ""grandstand.""

By Dustin Volz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A senior Democratic lawmaker said Sunday he had ""no doubt"" that Russia was behind recent hacking attempts targeting state election systems, and urged the Obama administration to publicly blame Moscow for trying to undermine confidence in the Nov. 8 presidential contest.The remarks from Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, come amid heightened concerns among U.S. and state officials about the security of voting machines and databases, and unsubstantiated allegations from Republican candidate Donald Trump that the election could be ""rigged.""""I have no doubt [this is Russia]. And I don't think the administration has any doubt,"" Schiff said during an appearance on ABC's ""This Week.""Schiff's call to name and shame the Kremlin came a week after Trump questioned widely held conclusions made privately by the U.S. intelligence community that Russia is responsible for the hacking activity.
""It could be Russia, but it could also be China,"" Trump said during a televised debate with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. ""It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.""On Saturday, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said hackers have probed the voting systems of many U.S. states but there is no sign that they have manipulated any voting data.Schiff said he doubted hackers could falsify vote tallies in a way to affect the election outcome. Officials and experts have said the decentralized and outdated nature of U.S. voting technology makes such hacks more unlikely.
But cyber attacks on voter registration systems could ""sow discord"" on election day, Schiff said. He further added that leaks of doctored emails would be difficult to disprove and could ""be election altering.""The National Security Agency, FBI and DHS all concluded weeks ago that Russian intelligence agencies conducted, directed or coordinated all the major cyberattacks on U.S. political organizations, including the Democratic National Committee, and individuals, a U.S. official who is participating in the investigations said on Sunday.
    However, the official said, White House officials have resisted naming the Russians publicly because doing so could result in escalating cyberattacks, and because it is considered impossible to offer public, unclassified proof of the allegation. Schiff and Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate intelligence committee, said last month they had concluded Russian intelligence agencies were ""making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election.""

| ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE

ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE Pope Francis on Sunday advised U.S. Catholics who feel they are torn between two imperfect candidates for president to study and pray before they vote and to make sure to follow their conscience.During his traditional, freewheeling in-flight news conference with reporters on the plane returning from Azerbaijan, Francis was asked how he would counsel American faithful and what wisdom they should keep in mind.""You have asked me a question that describes a difficult choice because, according to you, there are difficulties with one and difficulties with the other,"" the pope said, without naming Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump.In posing the question, the reporter made allusions to Clinton's support of abortion and Trump's statements vilifying migrants and religious minorities.
""During political campaigns, I never say a word,"" the pope said. ""The people are sovereign. I would only say, study the proposals well, pray and choose with your conscience."" But in the rest of his response, while stressing that he wanted to talk about a ""fictional situation,"" Francis appeared to be saying that the United States was among the countries that had become so politicized that it had effectively lost what he called a culture of politics.""When in any country there are two, three or four candidates who don't satisfy everyone, it means that perhaps the political life of that country has become too politicized and that it does not have much political culture,"" he said.
""People say 'I'm from this party' or 'I'm from that party,' but effectively, they don't have clear thoughts about the basics, about proposals,"" he said.Last February, while returning from Mexico, the pope was asked if U.S. Catholics could vote for someone with Trump's views on immigration, particularly on the candidate's promise to build a wall at the border with Mexico.
He said a person with such views was ""not Christian.""Trump struck back, calling the pope's comments ""disgraceful.""    (Reporting by Philip Pullella; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)"

MANHEIM, Pa. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump closed out a rough week for his campaign on Saturday by escalating personal attacks on Democrat Hillary Clinton, questioning her stamina and saying she should be in prison for her handling of classified emails.After a week in which he drew wide criticism for a public feud with a former beauty queen, Trump sought to rebound with a highly negative attack on his opponent in the Nov. 8 election, with a second presidential debate against her looming in a week.At the same time, the New York Times reported it had obtained records showing Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns, a deduction so large that it may have allowed him to avoid paying any federal income taxes for years.Trump has refused to release his tax records, saying he is under a federal audit.At a rally in Manheim, Pennsylvania, Trump said he did not believe Clinton, who suffered a bout of pneumonia last month, was up to the task of being president. He tried to resurrect a tactic he employed against former Republican rival Jeb Bush, who Trump had derided as ""low energy.""Clinton kept her pneumonia diagnosis private until she was seen nearly collapsing while getting into her vehicle at a ceremony marking the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York.
Ticking off a list of world problems, Trump said, ""She's supposed to fight all of these things and she can't make it 15 feet to her car. Give me a break.""""Folks, we need stamina, we need energy, we need people who are going to turn deals around,"" Trump said.Trump has often told crowds who chant ""lock her up"" over her use of a private email server as U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 to instead help him defeat her.
But on Saturday, Trump told thousands of supporters that Clinton's handling of classified emails and destroying of 33,000 emails that she had deemed of a personal nature meant that ""she should be in prison, let me tell you.""Trump did not stop there. He said he did not believe Clinton would be loyal to her supporters and chuckled, ""I don't even think she's loyal to Bill, to tell you the truth. And why should she be, right? Why should she be?""In 1998, Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, was caught up in a sex scandal involving former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
Trump was widely seen as having lost his first presidential debate with Clinton last Monday although he cites online polls showing he won.In the days since the debate, Trump has been struggling to regain his footing, getting caught up in a back-and-forth with former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who Trump had criticized for gaining weight.

WASHINGTON Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns and the large tax deduction may have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years, the New York Times reported on Saturday.The Trump campaign, in a statement responding to the Times report, said that the tax document was obtained illegally and that the New York Times is operating as an extension of the presidential campaign of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.The Times said it had obtained Trump's 1995 tax records and that they showed he received the large tax benefits from financial deals that went bad in the early 1990s.The newspaper said that tax experts it hired to analyze Trump's records said tax rules which are especially advantageous to wealthy filers would have let Trump use his $916 million loss to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income over an 18-year period.
The Times said that although Trump's taxable income in subsequent years is as yet unknown, a $916 million loss in 1995 would have been large enough to wipe out more than $50 million a year in taxable income over 18 years.Trump has declined to release his tax records, unlike previous presidential nominees in modern history, saying his taxes are under a federal audit. Experts say he could still release them publicly if he wished.
""Mr. Trump is a highly-skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required,"" the Trump campaign statement said.
""That being said, Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes, along with very substantial charitable contributions,"" it said.
