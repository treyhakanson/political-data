WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama formally endorsed fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton for president on Thursday, describing himself as eager to get out and campaign for her, days after she gained the delegates needed to secure the party's White House nomination.""I don't think there has ever been someone so qualified to hold this office,"" Obama said in a video released by the Clinton campaign. ""I'm with her, I'm fired up and I cannot wait to get out there and campaign with Hillary.""

WASHINGTON A bill to slash funding for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Internal Revenue Service and other financial regulators passed a key committee in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday after a long partisan fight.The expansive legislation would also place a halt on the payday lending restrictions that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently proposed.The Appropriations Committee voted 30-17 to approve the bill allocating funds for financial services and general government, which now goes to the full House.One of the committee's senior Democrats, Jose Serrano of New York, warned that the ""bill in its current form will be vetoed."" The Senate must still pass accompanying legislation. After that, both chambers will reconcile their bills into a single piece for President Barack Obama to sign or veto. Congress has tangled over budget laws for years, and federal agencies frequently rely on temporary continuing resolutions for funding.
Republicans cast the bill as a way to streamline agencies and hold them accountable for spending decisions, while saving taxpayer money.Democrats attacked what they called ""riders"" to the bill, such as a measure to stop the Federal Communications Commission's net neutrality rule and one to prevent corporations from being required to disclose political donations. They also said cuts to the SEC would hobble the agency in carrying out its duties and implementing the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.
Earlier this month the CFPB, charged with shielding consumers from financial fraud, proposed rules to limit short-term borrowings known as ""payday"" loans, which can charge interest as high as 390 percent.Critics say the proposal will cut off credit to poor people who may need small loans during emergencies. Representative Steven Palazzo, a Mississippi Republican, proposed an amendment on Thursday to delay implementing the rules until the bureau reports to Congress on their possible effects, saying he was concerned they could force people to turn to loan sharks. 
Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz had been one of the few members of her party to oppose the rules, and had sponsored a bill to delay CFPB rules for two years. Wasserman Schultz, who is also a U.S. representative from Florida, reversed her position in the last week. She told the hearing on Thursday the proposal is ""inarguably a step in the right direction,"" adding, ""I stand with the CFPB in its efforts to protect Americans from predatory lending.""

By Lawrence Hurley

The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that Puerto Rico cannot pursue charges against people for the same crime that federal authorities have already prosecuted them, dealing a blow to the U.S. territory's claim that while it is not a state it should be treated like one.The court ruled 6-2 in favor of defendants Luis Sanchez Valle and Jaime Gomez Vazquez, who were charged with illegally selling guns in 2008 by Puerto Rican authorities as well as federal prosecutors.The two pleaded guilty to the federal charges and then argued that Puerto Rico's indictments should be dismissed because of the double jeopardy clause of the U.S. Constitution that bars people from being prosecuted twice for the same offense.A trial judge dismissed the Puerto Rico charges, but they were reinstated by an appeals court. In a March 2015 ruling, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court ruled against prosecutors, prompting the territory to appeal to the high court.
On its surface, the case was about criminal law. But it also raised questions about the extent to which the Caribbean island, which has been a U.S. territory since 1898, has sovereign powers akin to any of the 50 U.S. states. The double jeopardy clause allows U.S. states and the federal government to prosecute people separately for the same actions because they are separate sovereign entities.The Supreme Court, in a ruling authored by Justice Elena Kagan, said that the original source of power for Puerto Rico's Constitution came from the U.S. Congress, via a 1950 law.""Put simply, Congress conferred the authority to create the Puerto Rico Constitution, which in turn confers the authority to bring criminal charges,"" Kagan wrote.
Liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor, whose parents were from Puerto Rico, and Stephen Breyer dissented.Some experts saw the federal government's argument against treating Puerto Rico as a separate governmental entity as having implications for another issue: how to deal with the territory's debt crisis.
In such a scenario, that argument could help establish a legal precedent that Puerto Rico is not a sovereign entity, possibly to justify imposing a federal control board or some other mechanism to address Puerto Rico's roughly $70 billion in debt. The U.S. Congress is currently considering legislation on the issue.The Supreme Court is expected to rule by the end of the month in another case involving Puerto Rico's bid to revive a law that would allow it to cut billions of dollars in debt at public utilities in a key test in its quest to weather its crisis.

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan unveiled a national security policy featuring stronger defense on Thursday, part of his agenda to unify Republicans after a divisive primary campaign, but softening some of the hard lines taken by the party's presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump.The plan is sharply critical of President Barack Obama, blaming the Democrat for ""eight years of broken promises, concessions, and retreat"" in the Syrian civil war, nuclear deal with Iran, chilly relations with Russia and dealings with a bellicose North Korea.It would overturn or back away from what Obama allies see as his foreign policy achievements, including the Iran deal and his moves toward normal relations with Communist-ruled Cuba. And it criticizes efforts to close the Guantanamo detention center.""It's not too much to say that our enemies no longer fear us and too many of our allies no longer trust us. And I think this is a direct result of the president's foreign policy,"" Ryan said as he and other House Republicans introduced the plan at the Council on Foreign Relations.While not providing figures, the plan also calls for an end to military rollbacks and demands ""adequate, predictable budgets.""Trump, whom Ryan has endorsed in the presidential race, has made a promise to erect a massive wall along the Mexican border - a centerpiece of his campaign. The plan announced on Thursday includes a range of border security measures such as ""high fencing,"" aerial surveillance and radar, but not a large wall.The plan echoes some of Trump's concerns about Muslim immigrants, with calls to tighten refugee screening and discussion of ways to prevent the radicalization of youths.
""We must constantly reassess our defenses in order to find and close security gaps so that Islamist militants cannot slip into our country undetected,"" Ryan's plan said.Representative Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee, said the intention was not to target followers of any one religion, but to do everything possible to not admit those who would attack Americans.""What we have to do is target the threat and make sure that they don't come in,"" said McCaul, one of several Republican committee chairmen who joined Ryan at the report presentation.
NOT ISOLATIONIST
The plan is not isolationist. It takes a strong line on battling militants abroad, saying the United States must keep all options on the table and ""eliminate terrorist sanctuaries."" Trump has been critical of some U.S. alliances. Ryan's plan, in contrast, underscores the importance of NATO. It also includes many standard Republican policy prescriptions, such as strong ties to Israel, advocacy of severe sanctions on Iran and an insistence that Washington should stand up to Russia.It also calls for more trade agreements and says foreign aid programs should make recipient countries self-sufficient.
The plan calls for increased security for diplomats and facilities overseas. In that context, it mentions the 2012 attacks on Benghazi, which many Republicans cite to criticize then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Trump's rival in the White House race.Several of Thursday's speakers criticized Clinton as they blasted Obama's foreign policy, because she was the nation's top diplomat during the first four years of his term. Democrats sought to tie the plan to some of Trump's most controversial statements, including his rejection of alliances like NATO, advocacy of waterboarding and calls for attacks on the families of terrorist suspects.""Perhaps this agenda is light on details because the Republican presidential candidate has offered a truly disturbing vision of America's role in the world,"" Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement.Ryan, the country's highest-ranking elected Republican, has described the agenda as a way to offer voters a coherent policy message for 2017. He unveiled an anti-poverty agenda on Monday. Initiatives on regulation, constitutional authority, healthcare and tax reform are expected in the coming weeks.

WASHINGTON U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders returned to Washington for meetings on Thursday with President Barack Obama and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid as Democrats pressured him to end his presidential campaign and support Hillary Clinton after a hard-fought primary race.Clinton, a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady, secured enough delegates to secure the Democratic nomination this week and become the first woman to lead a major U.S. party as its presidential nominee.Despite Clinton's commanding victories in California and New Jersey in presidential contests on Tuesday, Sanders vowed to carry his populist campaign to the Democratic National Convention in July, when the party's nominee is formally chosen.Obama, who is expected to endorse Clinton soon, was scheduled to meet with Sanders at the White House on Thursday at 11:15 a.m. (1515 GMT). Sanders will meet with Reid, his Senate colleague, in the afternoon.The Sanders campaign, which waged an unexpectedly strong challenge to a better-known and better-funded Democrat, has decried what it called Clinton's anointment by the party establishment and the media.
In an interview taped on Wednesday for broadcast on the NBC's ""Tonight"" show on Thursday, Obama said he hoped that divisions between Democrats would start to heal in coming weeks now that Clinton has clinched the party's nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election.At a fund-raiser in New York City on Wednesday, Obama said he was not too worried about bruised feelings after the primary and said ""it was a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to have a contested primary.""
Obama praised Sanders, the democratic socialist senator from Vermont, for bringing new energy and ideas to the party. ""He pushed the party and challenged them,"" he said. ""I thought it made Hillary a better candidate.""Democrats are striking a delicate balance between the need to unite behind Clinton in the looming battle against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump and not alienating Sanders and his supporters.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, herself a progressive known as a fiery critic of Wall Street, is preparing to endorse Clinton in the coming weeks after staying neutral in the Democratic primary, people familiar with her thinking told Reuters.
