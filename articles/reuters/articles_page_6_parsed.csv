BERLIN Outgoing U.S. President Barack Obama says he plans to come back to Germany at least one more time -- to visit Munich's annual beer-swigging Oktoberfest.""It's wonderful to be back in Berlin. This is my sixth visit to Germany, it will not be my last,"" Obama told a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.""I have somehow continued to miss Oktoberfest so that's probably something that is better for me to do as a former president rather than as president. I'll have more fun,"" he said.Around 7.5 million litres of beer are consumed each year at the Oktoberfest by locals and tourists alike, many decked out in traditional lederhosen and dirndls.

BERLIN U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday said he hoped President-elect Donald Trump could stand up to Russia when needed, and would take a constructive approach to cooperating with Moscow where interests aligned.""In order for us to solve many big problems around the world, it is in our interest to work with Russia,"" Obama told a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.""My hope is that the president-elect coming in takes a similarly constructive approach, finding areas where we can cooperate with Russia where our values and interests align, but that the president-elect also is willing to stand up to Russia when they are deviating from our values and international norms,"" Obama said.
He added it was important for sanctions imposed against Russia over its actions in eastern Ukraine to remain in place until Moscow complied with the Minsk peace agreement.
Obama, asked if he thought Merkel should run for a fourth term as chancellor, said he considered her an outstanding leader and would vote for Merkel, if he were a German citizen.

WASHINGTON Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have decided to pursue a short-term measure to keep the government funded at current levels until March in order to give incoming President-elect Donald Trump more of a say on budget and appropriations issues, lawmakers said on Thursday.The decision, which surfaced as House Republicans prepared to meet Vice President-elect Mike Pence, calls for replacing a funding measure that expires on Dec. 9 with a similar resolution that would run through March 31.Lawmakers said the short-term measure would allow Trump to have greater input on setting funding priorities for the remainder of fiscal year 2017, which ends on Sept 30.""I think the new, incoming government would like to have a say-so on how spending is allocated,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters. ""And so we are working with ... the new Trump administration on the timing of that on the continuing resolution.""Democrats and some Republicans described the decision as a mistake that could lead to a more difficult appropriations task next year.
Representative Hal Rogers, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, expressed disappointment at the decision, which suspends months of work by lawmakers and their staffs on full-scale appropriations bills Congress had intended to enact before year end.""I am extremely hopeful that the new Congress and the new administration will finish these bills,"" Rogers said in a statement, adding that his panel would immediately begin working on the new measure, known as a continuing resolution.Representative Charlie Dent, a Republican member of Rogers' committee, called the decision a mistake following an election in which Democrats were able to increase their Senate minority. 
""It will be harder to pass an omnibus in March,"" Dent said. ""And we'll have a smaller margin in the senate to help us. I'd rather clear the decks for a new administration. But apparently the new administration would like to be able to put their imprint on this.""House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said the continuing resolution would only perpetuate uncertainty about government funding. 
""They're making a big mistake for themselves. They're going to have a kettle of fish in March that they can't even imagine,"" she said.Some conservative House Republicans have sought a continuing resolution that would expire at the same time as the legislative limit on the government debt.

By Idrees Ali
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Officials in the U.S. military's Central Command, which oversees combat operations in the Middle East and South Asia, were much more likely than counterparts elsewhere to believe superiors  distorted or suppressed their analyses, according to a government intelligence survey.    Results of the December 2015 survey are likely to reinforce questions in Congress and elsewhere about whether the administration is pressuring officials to make over-optimistic claims about progress against Islamic State and the Taliban to help U.S. President Barack Obama leave office in January on a high note.    The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)     survey, which had not been reported until now, was one of the main topics of a House intelligence committee hearing on Thursday.    In one of its more striking findings, only 36 percent of  Central Command officials surveyed said they were confident that their mid- and senior-level managers were not deliberately distorting or suppressing their analyses.The average for the other eight U.S. military commands, which include those in the Pacific, Africa and Europe, was 72 percent.Central Command directs the American military missions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and South Asia. Its analysts typically assess intelligence such as potential targets for bombing and an enemy's strength.Asked if ""anyone attempted to distort or suppress analysis on which you were working in the face of persuasive evidence,"" 40 percent of the CENTCOM respondents said yes, compared to an average of 13 percent.
The survey found that when that question was asked, 65 percent of the command's respondents said ""politicization"" was an issue. ""The data suggests respondents from Central Command believe their workplace adheres to objectivity standards relatively less than do workplaces of their IC counterparts,"" the report said, using an acronym for the U.S. intelligence community. SPY CHIEF 

Outgoing Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said the situation at Central Command had improved in the 2016 survey. Clapper told a congressional intelligence hearing on Thursday that CENTCOM objectivity numbers were now similar to those in other combatant commands.""I do think there is, by virtue of the change in commanders and...(there) has been a change in the atmosphere there and so I've been encouraged by the trends particularly this year,"" Clapper said. CENTCOM did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Separately, Clapper told the hearing that he had submitted his letter of resignation but would stay until the end of the Obama administration.The survey has been conducted annually since 2006 and about 4,000 analysts and managers responded to it, including 125 CENTCOM analysts and managers. It cautions, however, that because responses were voluntary, ""care should be taken when broadly interpreting results"" for each command.        
Officials in other U.S. intelligence agencies said the Central Command issues were not the product of pressure from White House or other senior officials, and played a minor role in the administration's public claims of progress against Islamic State and the Taliban, many of which have proved to be overly optimistic.That is true, these officials said, because much of the Central Command analysis consists of daily bomb damage assessments and other situation reports, not strategic intelligence, and constitutes only a small part of the material that finds its way from numerous other intelligence agencies, including the CIA and the National Security Agency, into the President's daily intelligence briefing.Nevertheless, the findings of the survey, which was posted with no notice last month on a remote part of the ODNI website, are likely to raise questions about intelligence assessments provided by Central Command.Earlier this year, a U.S. congressional report said Central Command painted too rosy a picture of the fight against Islamic State in 2014 and 2015 compared with the reality on the ground and grimmer assessments by other analysts.      The Defense Department Inspector General is investigating the findings and is expected to issue a separate report, military officials said.

By Valerie Volcovici
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Senator Bernie Sanders, a former Democratic presidential candidate, said on Thursday he will help rebuild party support outside of Washington and craft a new economic message for all Americans.Sanders, who will become outreach chair on the Senate Democrats leadership team, will try to engage Americans who feel disconnected from the political process. Sanders is an Independent from Vermont but tends to vote with Democrats.   ""The real action to transform America won't take place on Capitol Hill, it will be in the grassroots America among millions struggling economically and young people,"" Sanders said at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.Democrat Charles Schumer of New York, elected the Senate's new minority leader on Wednesday, said Sanders will join his 10-member leadership team. He wants to harness Sanders' popularity with young and working class voters during the hard-fought primary battle with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Democrats are regrouping after the upset victory of Republican Donald Trump and after Republicans gained control of the Senate and House and made big gains in control of state legislatures.Sanders, who will also become the ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, said he will make sure the panel represents the needs of working families, not billionaires.One problem for the Democrats is while they make the point that the economy is better off today than it was eight years ago, it has not improved for the middle class for decades, he said.
""What the Democrats I think too often have ignored is that for the last forty years ... the middle class of this country has been shrinking,"" Sanders told the breakfast, saying that real wages have gone down while income inequality has risen.    Sanders said he supports fresh leadership for the Democratic National Committee, the party's organization and has endorsed Congressman Keith Ellison, of Minnesota, as the new leader of the party. Ellison, who is a progressive and a Muslim, reflects the diversity of the party, Sanders and other Democrats say. 
Sanders also said that Hillary Clinton should play a key role. After her defeat last week, Sanders said he did not talk to her directly, only on a conference call.""She ended up getting more votes that Mr. Trump and it goes without saying that she has a very important role to play about the future of the Democratic party,"" he said.

By Alistair Bell and Ginger Gibson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON One day before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's first meeting with a foreign leader, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japanese officials said they had not finalized when or where in New York it would take place, who would be invited, or in some cases whom to call for answers.Uncertainty over the talks shows the difficulties in turning Trump from a freewheeling businessman into a sitting president with a watertight schedule and a fully functioning administration by his inauguration on Jan. 20.              Japanese and U.S. officials said on Wednesday the State Department had not been involved in planning the meeting, leaving the logistical and protocol details that normally would be settled far in advance still to be determined.""There has been a lot of confusion,"" said one Japanese official. The meeting was only agreed to last week and Trump and his advisers have been busy in meetings at his headquarters in Manhattan's Trump Tower in recent days to work out who gets which job in the new administration. While world leaders sometimes hold loosely planned bilateral meetings at regional summits, it is unusual for foreign leaders to hold high-level diplomatic talks in the United States without detailed planning. Abe is on his way to an Asia-Pacific summit in Peru.State Department spokesman John Kirby said that to his knowledge, Trump's transition team had not been in contact with the department either to discuss the transition of government or to seek information ahead of his meetings with foreign leaders.Trump is expected to use the Abe meeting to reassure Japan and other Asian allies rattled by his campaign rhetoric, advisers to Trump said. But Trump, a brash outsider with no diplomatic or government experience, and Abe, a veteran lawmaker, have differences on policy issues such as free trade.    Several Trump aides did not immediately answer requests on Wednesday for comment about the Abe visit or contact between the transition team and the State Department.   TRANSITION SPECULATION
Speculation about top appointments to the Trump administration has intensified since the head of the team overseeing the transition, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, was removed last week and replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence.Transition team officials said on Wednesday night that Trump planned to announce ""landing teams"" on Thursday that would begin setting up staff in key agencies, like the State and Justice departments.
They added in a conference call with reporters that those who begin working on the teams would have to sign an agreement not to lobby for five years after they leave the administration, keeping with a Trump campaign promise to institute a ban on lobbying for executive branch employees. Trump on Wednesday denounced reports of disorganization in the team, singling out the New York Times for saying world leaders have had trouble getting in touch with him since his upset victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election.    The Republican real estate magnate said on Twitter he had taken ""calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan."" The Times, a frequent target of Trump's Twitter blasts, said on Tuesday that U.S. allies were ""scrambling to figure out how and when to contact Mr. Trump"" and blindly dialing in to Trump Tower to try to reach him.The newspaper said Trump was working without official State Department briefing materials in his dealings with foreign leaders.        ""The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition,"" Trump tweeted, without specifying what it was in the article that was incorrect. ""It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders.""    Trump and Pence had spoken to 29 foreign leaders, the transition team said on Wednesday.
Trump has mostly stuck to normal practice for a U.S. president-elect with the order in which he has spoken to foreign leaders on the phone since his election victory.But some of his contacts have stretched the limits of the usual procedure.     Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, an army general who seized power three years ago, appears to have been the first leader to speak to Trump after the election, ahead of closer allies like the leaders of Britain and Germany.Sisi's office called Trump last Wednesday and the incoming U.S. president told him it was ""the first international call he had received to congratulate him on winning the election."" Australian media reported that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was the second leader Trump spoke to, after the Australian ambassador to the United States got Trump's personal phone number from Australian golfer and Trump friend Greg Norman. Trump also talked on the phone to the leaders of Britain, Germany, Turkey and other allies.  But a phone call on Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which the two men agreed to aim for ""constructive cooperation,"" raised eyebrows among Democrats and traditionalist Republicans worried about a resurgent Moscow.
Trump also met Britain's anti-EU Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage at Trump Tower last weekend, ahead of any meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May.State Department spokesman Kirby said: ""There's been no outreach to date"" from Trump's transition aides. ""But it's not for us to approve or disapprove of conversations that the president-elect is having or may have in the future with foreign leaders.""'ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS'
Despite fevered speculation, Trump has yet to say who will fill Cabinet positions such as secretary of state, treasury secretary or defense secretary. His team said that was not unusual and was in line with the timing of the transition of Democrat Barack Obama to the White House after he won the presidency in 2008. Trump could add son-in-law Jared Kushner as a top White House adviser, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, has been a central adviser during the campaign and transition. The Trump transition team has repeatedly denied it is seeking high-level security clearance for Kushner.A federal anti-nepotism law prohibits a president from hiring family members to serve in his administration, but the Journal said it was not clear if the law applied to a position inside the White House. It added Kushner had indicated he would avoid the issue by not taking pay for any White House work.      Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump aide who served as his campaign manager, said she did not think Kushner was seeking an official role in the White House.""I just hung up the phone with Jared, and we didn't discuss that,"" Conway told reporters on Wednesday night. ""I think he just wants to be incredibly helpful to his father-in-law as he's been all along.""South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley will meet with Trump on Thursday, the transition team said. She emerged on Wednesday as a potential candidate for secretary of state.After speculation emerged that JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon remained a contender for treasury secretary, the bank's stock price dropped.
