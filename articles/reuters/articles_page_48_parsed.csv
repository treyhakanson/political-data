By Alana Wise
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Billionaire technology investor Peter Thiel, a lightning rod for criticism in Silicon Valley for his support of Donald Trump, predicted on Monday that the movement the Republican presidential nominee has created would carry on even if he loses his bid for the White House on Nov. 8.""No matter what happens in this election, what Trump represents isn't crazy, and it's not going away,"" Thiel said in a speech to reporters at the National Press Club in Washington. Thiel, who announced earlier this month he was donating $1.25 million to help Trump get elected, said the New York businessman was laying the groundwork for ""a new Republican Party"" that will go ""beyond the dogmas of Reaganism.""Thiel attacked Washington in his remarks, saying its elite insiders were out of touch with ordinary Americans and that Trump was shaking up a system in need of change.        ""The truth is, no matter how crazy this election seems, it is less crazy than the condition of our country,"" said Thiel.While it is impossible to predict what will happen to Trump and his followers after the election, Thiel is not alone in his view.""This will certainly continue after Nov. 8, whether Donald Trump is leading the movement or not,"" Republican strategist Alice Stewart said on Monday, arguing that the movement surrounding Trump will have lasting effects on the Republican Party.""Without a doubt, Trump has tapped into an electorate that has felt like their voices have not been heard in quite some time,"" she said, adding that the Republican Party old guard would have to work with followers of Trump's newer brand of conservatism, regardless of the outcome of the election, if the party is to survive.
IMPERFECT PEOPLE
Thiel, who was born in Germany and came to the United States as a child, is best known as a co-founder of online payment service PayPal Holdings Inc and an early backer of online social network Facebook Inc.His support for the real estate developer and reality TV star has made him a target for scorn in liberal-leaning tech circles, especially after his full-throated endorsement of Trump at the Republican National Convention in July.
The only major-name Trump backer in Silicon Valley, Thiel has attracted criticism and some have called for Thiel's removal from Facebook's board. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has insisted on Thiel staying, citing the importance of diversity of opinion at the company. Trump's tirades against cross-border trade agreements and immigration run counter to the views of most in the U.S. tech industry, which sells its products worldwide and has leaned heavily on talented programmers coming to the United States from overseas. On Monday, Thiel accused the media of taking too literally many of Trump's more controversial proposals, including imposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country and building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.He also said the comments Trump made about groping and kissing women in a 2005 video that was made public earlier this month were ""clearly offensive and inappropriate."" 
But Thiel said he and other Trump supporters were voting on policy, not personality. He added that both Trump and White House rival Democrat Hillary Clinton were ""imperfect people, to say the least."" On top of his political views, Thiel has faced a backlash in the media for secretly funding a lawsuit against the online publishing company Gawker Media by former professional wrestler Terry Bollea, known professionally as Hulk Hogan, that ultimately led to the bankruptcy and sale of Gawker. Thiel on Monday defended his decision to bankroll the suit against the site, which a decade earlier outed Thiel as gay in an article entitled ""Peter Thiel is totally gay, people."" Thiel said the judicial system was too costly for all but the very rich.""If you're a single-digit millionaire like Hulk Hogan, you have no effective access to the legal system,"" he said.Clinton holds a 5-point lead over Trump in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, with the backing of 44 percent of likely voters compared to Trump with 39 percent.

By Amy Tennery
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK CNN cut ties with political commentator and interim Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile after leaked emails suggested she offered advisers to Hillary Clinton advance information about presidential debate questions, the news network reported on Monday.Brazile came under fire earlier this month after a hacked email published by WikiLeaks showed she may have tipped off the Democratic presidential nominee's campaign about a March CNN town-hall debate question about the death penalty.CNN announced her departure after a subsequent leaked email showed she said she was privy to ""questions in advance"" and offered to ""send a few more."" Brazile had offered the network her resignation earlier this month, CNN reported.Brazile previously denied allegations that she gave the Clinton campaign information about debate questions ahead of time, according to media reports.
Brazile, currently serving as interim head of the DNC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment but posted several tweets on Monday as the news broke.""Thank you @CNN,"" Brazile tweeted. ""Honored to be a Democratic strategist and commentator on the network. Godspeed to all my former colleagues.""Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized CNN, alleging it is biased against his campaign.
A Clinton spokesman said in an email the campaign would not comment ""on the authenticity of any individual emails that have been hacked by the Russian government.""FBI Director James Comey said on Friday the agency was probing more emails that might relate to Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.

By Julia Harte and Mark Hosenball
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch did not order FBI Director James Comey to withhold from Congress the discovery of emails potentially related to the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server, but she made it known that she thought his decision violated department policy, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday.As Comey and Lynch aides debated last Thursday whether alerting Congress about the emails would comply with longstanding Justice Department policy against announcing overt investigative steps that would influence an upcoming election, Comey asked whether he was being explicitly directed not to do so.Lynch never gave Comey the order not to send the emails, a senior government official said.Comey's letter on Friday notifying members of Congress that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had discovered new emails apparently pertinent to the Clinton server probe has upended the presidential race and given new hope to Republican candidate Donald Trump that he can make a comeback and win on Nov. 8.Lynch's office informed the FBI on Thursday that sending the letter conflicted with a memo containing official guidance that is sent to all Justice Department employees during presidential election years, according to the official. 
The memo instructs employees to ""never select the timing of investigative steps... for the purpose of affecting any election."" But the Justice Department made no effort to block the FBI from obtaining a search warrant to review the emails, which the agency received on Sunday. The department is working closely with the FBI on the case.
Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik told several members of Congress in letters on Monday that the Justice Department was dedicating ""all necessary resources"" to work with the FBI on its examination of the newly discovered emails ""as expeditiously as possible.""However, an official familiar with the FBI review said investigators could not predict how long the examination would take.Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, sent Comey a letter on Monday accusing the FBI of keeping ""explosive information"" under wraps about ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.
Reid wrote to the FBI in August, requesting information about those ties, including alleged meetings between a Trump adviser and several high-ranking sanctioned individuals in Russia in July, according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters.The FBI acknowledged that it received the letter and said it had replied to Reid's office. An aide to Reid said he was not aware of any response from Comey to the letter.

By Lisa Lambert
| October 31

October 31 Although the sale of marijuana is a federal crime, the number of U.S. banks working with pot businesses, now sanctioned in many states, is growing, up 45 percent in the last year alone.Still, marijuana merchants say there are not nearly enough banks willing to take their cash. So many dispensaries resort to stashing cash in storage units, back offices and armored vans.Proponents believe the Nov. 8 election could tip the balance in favor of liberalizing federal marijuana laws, a move seen as key to getting risk-averse banks off the sidelines. Measures on ballots in California, Florida and seven other states would bring to 34 the number of states sanctioning pot for medical or recreational use, or both. That could push annual sales, by one estimate, to $23 billion.The prospect for a market of such scale is adding urgency to calls for a national approach to marijuana that expands banking options. Law enforcement and Federal Reserve officials have expressed concern about the fraud and crime associated with un-bankable cash.Nearly 600 dispensary robberies have been reported in Denver since recreational pot was legalized in Colorado three years ago.""There's not a single human being who thinks there is any benefit at all in forcing marijuana business to be conducted on an all-cash basis,"" said Rep. Earl Blumenauer, a Democrat from Oregon who has called for the decriminalization of marijuana since coming to Congress in 1996.MONEY LAUNDERING
The U.S. Justice Department said in 2014 it would not prosecute banks for serving state-sanctioned marijuana businesses. At the same time, the Treasury Department requires banks to report suspected drug crimes.At last count, 301 banks were serving marijuana businesses, according to the Treasury Department. Many more have avoided the sector out of fear that making the wrong call could put them at risk, said Robert Rowe, a vice president at the American Bankers Association.
The National Cannabis Association is pressing Congress for a law that would hold banks harmless for handling pot cash, said Michael Correia, a lobbyist for the trade group. If California legalizes recreational use next week, the nation's biggest Congressional delegation will have a big stake in the issue.In lieu of federal action, some states have tried their own fixes. Colorado created a credit union system for state-sanctioned marijuana businesses. But it fell apart when the Kansas City Federal Reserve denied a Colorado pot credit union access to the national payments system, which distributes currency and clears checks and electronic payments.California has no such plans, said Tom Dresslar, spokesman for the state's Department of Business Oversight.""This was a problem created by federal law,"" Dresslar said, ""and it needs a federal solution.""In northern California, where growers serve state-sanctioned medical dispensaries as well as the black market, the Community Credit Union of Southern Humboldt stopped opening pot business accounts because of the red tape and uncertainty, said senior vice president Janet Sanchez.""We're not being asked to go over to the gun dealer and ask them if they're making appropriate background checks,"" she said.
Dispensary operators unable to find willing banks tell tales of subterfuge, recordkeeping nightmares and armies of security guards. Many open bank accounts and submit credit card charges in ways that obscure their true enterprise, such as ""spa services.""Susana de la Rionda has run a Los Angeles medical marijuana dispensary for 12 years and has had to find a new bank about once a year and submit to tax audits twice as often.""I feel like a gangster,"" she said.Denver Relief dispensary founder Ean Seeb said operators always are trying workarounds to get cash into banks, including washing bills in fabric softener to hide the odor of pot. For a time, he said, one automated teller machine near a Denver mall drew lines every night of marijuana merchants, each depositing the maximum $500 in cash.
WEEDING OUT RISK
Partner Colorado Credit Union began working with state-sanctioned dispensaries two years ago and has developed elaborate protocols to minimize risk, including an initial vetting that can take three weeks. It uses armored trucks to take cash deposits directly from dispensaries to the Denver branch of the Federal Reserve Bank.When the credit union spots a red flag, Chief Executive Sundie Seefried dispatches employees to pay the dispensary a visit, and she has closed two accounts for compliance problems. Seefried encourages operators to visit by keeping fine cigars in her office, and she stays in touch with regulators.""Our program is designed with eyes on the business, eyes on the owner, eyes on the money,"" she said.With 95 dispensary members, Seefried said the credit union is at capacity, and she hopes more bankers will get involved. She fields calls for advice, speaks to industry groups and, earlier this year, shared what she's learned in a book.Despite the safeguards, Seefried said she takes nothing for granted. Every few months, she said she drills her staff to make sure they know what to do in the event of her arrest.""What calls are you going to make?"" she said she asks them.""If you don't have a little fear going into this because of the illegality at the federal level, you're probably not the person to do this job,"" she said.

By Alister Doyle
| OSLO

OSLO Backers of a global accord to fight climate change that formally comes into force on Friday say they are confident the deal can survive any legal challenges by U.S. Republican candidate Donald Trump if he wins next week's presidential election.Trump has threatened to reject the accord negotiated by nearly 200 governments, including that of U.S. President Barack Obama. Trump once tweeted that global warming was a concept invented by the Chinese to harm U.S. industry.By contrast, his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has strongly supported the plan, which enters into force after major greenhouse gas emitters the United States, China and India ratified it. The Paris Agreement aims to phase out man-made greenhouse gases in the second half of the century to avert floods, heatwaves, droughts and rising sea levels.  Delegates from signatory nations meet in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh on Nov. 7-18 to start turning their many promises on tackling climate change into action and draw up a ""rule book"" for the sometimes fuzzily worded accord reached last December.Adding urgency, 2016 is set to be the hottest year since records began in the 19th century.The U.S. election, on Nov. 8, injects a large dose of political uncertainty into the gathering of environment ministers and senior officials in Marrakesh.The relatively speedy ratification of the climate pact, a year before many predictions, was partly driven by Trump's threats to reject the accord. Some delegates played down the risk of a President Trump reneging on the deal.""The momentum is such that it would take a heck of a climate skeptic to back pedal,"" said Tosi Mpanu Mpanu of the Democratic Republic of Congo, who heads the group of 48 Least Developed Countries at the Morocco negotiations.""That's really why we have had this strong mobilization (to ratify). If Trump wins I don't think it will change anything.""'Moroccan Environment Minister Hakima El Haite, who will host the Marrakesh meeting, said he did not expect Trump, if elected,  would challenge the agreement, saying the American people were generally supportive of climate action.
And, as a businessman, ""(Trump) will understand that climate change is an opportunity to create jobs and new technologies"", she told Reuters recently in New York.Its entry into force gives some protection for the Paris Agreement under international law. Its Article 28 says any government wanting to quit has to wait through four years of formalities - the length of a U.S. presidential term.""ASTONISHING PROGRESS""
If he wins, Trump is likely to focus his efforts domestically on undoing Obama's plans to cut U.S. emissions, such as from coal-fired power plants.The Paris Agreement also helped to unlock U.N. accords this year to limit emissions from airlines and from powerful greenhouse gases used in air conditioners and refrigerators.
""There has been astonishing progress"" on climate change after years of deadlock, said Andrew Steer, head of the World Resources Institute think-tank.The global pacts contrast with more nationalist forces that helped Trump to win the U.S. Republican nomination for president and, on the other side of the Atlantic, Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union.The Paris Agreement enters into force after passing a threshold last month of ratification by 55 nations representing 55 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. The tally is now 87 nations representing about 60 percent of emissions.The United States alone accounts for 18 percent of global emissions. Under a Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Trump could not renounce the U.S. share and then argue that the entire entry into force was invalid.""Entry into force only goes one way. It can't be reversed,"" said Elliot Diringer, executive vice-president of the non-partisan Center for Climate and Energy Solutions in Washington. 
But there could be legal challenges. The U.S. Republican Party platform says Obama, a Democrat who used his executive powers to ratify the agreement, should have submitted it to the Senate, where it would almost certainly have been rejected.Governments in Marrakesh will try to bolster the pact, which sets many goals for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 or 2030. Governments are under pressure to spell out what they will do now rather than leave it to their successors.At its core, the Paris Agreement promises to limit global warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. But current pledges for limiting emissions are too weak and will allow temperatures to rise by perhaps 3C (5.4F) or more by 2100.Diplomats expect it will take two years or more to write a rule book for the accord. Among difficulties, the Agreement lets all countries set their own targets for emissions.That free-for-all design helped ensure wide support but is at odds with a need for a central set of rules to monitor and report greenhouse gas emissions from factories, cars, farms and power plants.Irrespective of the rules, the prices of renewable energies are falling sharply, prompting a shift from fossil fuels. U.S. climate envoy Jonathan Pershing said wind and solar energy accounted for two-thirds of all new electricity generating capacity installed in the United States in 2015. ""The U.S. solar industry now employs more people than coal,"" he said.Still, Trump says he will promote the U.S. coal and oil industries to safeguard domestic jobs and national security. He says a shift from fossil fuels would force the United States to be ""begging for oil again"" from Middle East suppliers.

A petition to the White House to halt the U.S. Navy's abolition of sailors' traditional ratings that are more than two centuries old has topped 100,000 signatures, above the number needed for an official response, according to the online petition site.The petition was launched within hours after Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson said on Sept. 29 that the Navy would do away with such ratings as gunner's mate and boatswain's mate.The plan to abolish the 241-year-old job titles system and replace it with one similar to other armed services' occupational specialty codes has sparked outrage among some current and former Navy personnel.""One by one current leadership continues to erode the very things that set the Navy apart from the other services. Mr. President, I and the others signing this petition request you use your authority to restore to our Sailors what they have earned,"" the petition said.
The request topped 100,000 signatures within 30 days, the requirement needed for official action by President Barack Obama's administration. The online site showed a total of 102,597 signatures on Monday.Officials say the switching of titles would allow the Navy to identify sailors' skills more accurately and give them better job opportunities when they leave the Navy.
The changes followed a review this year. The modernization plan will be implemented in multi-year phases, the Navy has said.Opponents have voiced their anger on Richardson's Facebook page. Carrie Herr wrote on Saturday, ""Help our Navy enlisted (personnel) restore the honor and tradition that was taken away from them. Save Navy ratings!""

By Tom Miles
| GENEVA

GENEVA Syria's political opposition hopes Hillary Clinton wins the U.S. presidential election next week because she has a better understanding of the conflict than Donald Trump, according to members of a delegation holding talks at the United Nations.Khaled Khoja and Hind Kabawat, in Geneva on Monday to press for U.N.-led negotiations on the release of Syrian detainees, said they trusted Clinton, a former U.S. Secretary of State, to deliver on the opposition's top priority - protecting civilians.Clinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and ""safe zones"" on the ground in Syria to protect non-combatants. Trump says this could ""lead to World War Three"" due to the potential for conflict with Russia, which is providing military support to President Bashar al-Assad.Kabawat said Trump, who has never held public office and has no foreign policy experience, saw Islamic State, also known as ISIS, as the only alternative to Assad in Syria. ""For us a woman's leadership at this time would be a good thing. Also for many, like Trump and others, they think that the Syrian conflict is comparing Assad with ISIS and they have to take one side or the other, and of course for them Assad will look more prominent than ISIS,"" said Kabawat. ""She (Clinton) knows that is wrong. She knows that there is this moderate opposition that believes in democracy and freedom. This is what we are aiming for, to have a president of the U.S. with good experience who knows the difference between the different oppositions.""
Assad, whose forces have regained much territory against their opponents with the help of Russian warplanes, has branded all those opposed to his rule as ""terrorists"". ISLAMIC STATE
Trump has said defeating Islamic State should be a higher priority than trying to persuade Assad to step aside, a departure from a long-held U.S. policy objective.
Khoja, leading the Syrian opposition delegation in Geneva, disagreed with this viewpoint.""Dealing with only the ISIS issue will not help with solving the crisis in Syria or the region because the root cause of the crisis is the (Assad) regime itself,"" he said.Kabawat, an attorney and a member of the opposition High Negotiations Committee, added that the Syrian political opposition wanted to see women playing an equal role to men in the nation's politics.
The opposition delegation, which has links to the Free Syrian Army but not with Islamic State or al Qaeda-linked groups, is in Geneva this week to revive the issue of prisoner releases, sidelined during months of fruitless peace talks.Khoja said more than 100 armed groups had shown their willingness to cooperate but there had been no sign of cooperation from Assad's government or Russia, adding that the United Nations should form a committee on the matter.""If it's needed, if there is a response from the regime side to release the detainees and stop killings inside Syria, then we can have the representative of the military groups also in this committee, and if the regime wants to send someone to this committee, we can discuss it,"" Khoja said. The Syrian Network of Human Rights has documented more than 90,000 detainees held by the Syrian government, 6,000 held by Islamic State and 2,400 held by the rest of the opposition, but estimates the real numbers are twice as high.
