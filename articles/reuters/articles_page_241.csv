By Colleen Jenkins

Transgender students cheered the Obama administration's directive on Friday requiring U.S. public schools to allow them to use toilets and locker rooms consistent with their gender identity while some school districts said they would not comply.""This is the strongest guidance to date from the federal government to schools instructing them on how they must treat transgender students fairly and without discrimination,"" said Ilona Turner, legal director at the Transgender Law Center in California. ""This will be something that courts will have to give great weight to.""The letter, signed by officials from the U.S. Education and Justice Departments, intensified the debate over balancing equal rights with privacy concerns. The Obama administration told U.S. public schools on Friday that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting Republicans and raising the likelihood of fights over federal funding and legal authority.Transgender student Gavin Grimm, who won a U.S. appeals court ruling in April in his fight over bathroom access at his Virginia high school, said he was happy with the support from the Obama administration.""This guidance would have made a big difference in my life,"" he wrote on Twitter.  Educators are facing scrutiny and legal action over access to toilets and locker rooms based on gender identity versus a student's sex at birth.
The federal government's position is that U.S. laws against sex discrimination in educational programs include gender identity. Friday's directive was the broadest attempt to enforce that stance on a national basis. But North Carolina's Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest said in a statement that the state would ""not stand by and let our locker rooms and high school showers be used for social experimentation at the expense of the privacy and protection of our young boys and girls."" Forest advised schools to reject the policy and said a state law enacted in March restricting bathroom choice for transgender people trumped the administration's ""non-binding directive.""North Carolina is locked in a high-profile legal battle with the federal government over its ""bathroom bill."" On Monday, Republican leaders of the state's legislature said they had sued the U.S. Justice Department over the state's law restricting public bathroom access for transgender people.
That lawsuit came hours after North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory sued the Justice Department, accusing it of overreaching after federal lawyers said the state's law requiring public bathroom use based on birth gender was a civil rights violation.   In Florida, Marion County Public Schools showed no sign of backing down from a resolution passed in April requiring students to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender on their birth certificate.""I don't believe our board will reverse the decision unless it is instructed by the courts,"" the school system's spokesman Kevin Christian said in a telephone interview.Mississippi's Department of Education said it would comply with the federal guidance.
MUNICIPALITIES ACT
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio signed an executive order in March allowing a person of any gender to choose whether to use a men's or women's toilet or locker room in all municipal properties including public parks, pools, and playgrounds. The order requires city agencies to post the policy in conspicuous locations within three months and to train all employees within two years.New York City's action came a week after South Dakota Governor Dennis Daugaard vetoed a bill that would have made the state the first to limit transgender students to bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their birth gender.In November, Houston voters overwhelmingly rejected a measure known as the ""bathroom ordinance"" that would have established non-discrimination protections for gay and transgender people.Nationwide, 22 percent of transgender and gender non-conforming people report being denied access to appropriate bathrooms at work, and 26 percent report being denied access to bathrooms in an educational setting, according to a survey conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.

By Lesley Wroughton, Patricia Zengerle and Matt Spetalnick
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The United States plans to renew the bulk of its sanctions against Myanmar when they expire next week, but will make some  changes aimed at boosting investment and trade, according to several senior U.S. officials and congressional aides.An announcement on extending much of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, could come as soon as Tuesday ahead of a visit to the Southeast Asian nation by Secretary of State John Kerry on May 22, officials said.The U.S. Treasury Department has significantly eased sanctions against Myanmar by issuing general licenses that give companies and investors exemptions to sanctions targeting more than 100 individuals and businesses, including some of Myanmar's biggest business players.U.S. officials began lifting trade and financial sanctions against the country after military leaders launched reforms that led to a civilian government being formed in 2011, beginning its transformation from a half-century as an international pariah.In December, Treasury temporarily relaxed trade restrictions on the country also known as Burma by allowing all shipments to go through its ports and airports for six months.This time, Washington will likely offer more general licenses to specific companies, and take some people off Treasury's list of ""Specially Designated Individuals"" targeted for sanctions, congressional aides and U.S. officials said.Kerry's visit to Myanmar is his first since the party of Aung San Suu Kyi, the country's Nobel laureate, swept to power following a landslide election win in November. A constitution drafted by the country's former military rulers bars her from becoming president.President Barack Obama's opening to Myanmar followed by its peaceful transition to an elected government is seen as one of his foreign policy achievements. He has visited there twice. But the administration also wants to maintain leverage on the country to guard against backsliding on reforms and to press for improvement on human rights.
By renewing the legal framework for sanctions even as it eases some measures, Obama will offer the private sector more breathing room while maintaining pressure on its military, which still holds significant political power. The sanctions had been due to expire on May 20.Washington has deep concerns about human rights conditions in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar, especially violence against ethnic and religious minorities including Rohingya Muslims.'ROAD TO DEMOCRACY'

Members of the U.S. Congress, from both parties, are watching closely and could move to clamp down on Myanmar themselves if they think Obama is moving too quickly.Last month, Senators Cory Gardner and Ben Cardin, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Foreign Relations Asia subcommittee, wrote to Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew expressing concern about rights, and asking the administration to work with Congress to ensure those concerns were addressed. ""Like you, we want to ensure that the U.S. is Burma's strongest supporter on its road to democracy,"" the senators said in the letter, seen by Reuters.U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Aung San Suu Kyi supported the extension of U.S. sanctions with some changes. Discussions with her have focused on how to properly target trade restrictions so they do not hurt Myanmar's overall economy, but keep pressure on military-owned institutions, they said.
""We are looking to take steps to demonstrate our support for the new democratically elected government of Burma ...and that we're taking the necessary steps to ensure that they succeed, that they can carry on economic developments and reforms,"" a senior administration official told Reuters.""At the same time we want to do that in a smart, measured way that gives us a range of options and flexibility to respond appropriately going forward,"" the official added.The United States is eager to expand relations with Myanmar to help counteract China's rise in Asia and take advantage of the opening of one of the world's last ""frontier markets,"" growing but less developed emerging economies.Peter Kucik, a former senior sanctions adviser at the U.S. Treasury, said despite an easing of some banking sanctions by the United States since 2012, transactions with Myanmar were still difficult.""I suspect the changes that get announced all drive at the same end goal: which is to promote and make easier the trade and business relationships between the two countries and encourage continued reform while minding concerns,"" said Kucik.""The details will really indicate where the principal areas of remaining concern are but broadly speaking they are going to be aligned with what we've seen so far,"" he said.

By Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The chairman of the Republican National Committee sought on Friday to tamp down talk among some Republicans about the possibility of running a third-party candidate who would give party supporters a choice beyond Donald Trump.In an interview, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said a third-party candidate would have no hope of actually winning the Nov. 8 presidential election but would instead ensure victory for the Democratic nominee.""They may as well jump off the top floor of a building because that's what we'd be doing by having a third party,"" Priebus said.Priebus has been a vocal advocate for party loyalists to get over their concerns about Trump and support him since he is on track to become the presidential nominee and stands as the only real option for Republicans to win the White House.He brought Trump together with House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan for a meeting in Washington on Thursday to try to ease Ryan's concerns about backing the billionaire. 
Ryan stopped short of endorsing Trump but said the session was productive. Priebus said the two men have opened a dialogue.""My guess is they may even be talking today and through the weekend (on the phone),"" he said.
Priebus said a Democratic victory would allow Democrats to reshape the conservative majority on the Supreme Court. If Republican donors sit on the sidelines, Democrats could also take over control of the U.S. Senate, he said.""If you don't participate in the presidential election you might as well kiss away the Senate as well,"" Priebus said in a message directed at Republican donors unenthusiastic about Trump. ""The Senate goes as the presidential race goes. They're inextricably intertwined.""Some Republicans continue to hold out hope that a leading figure in the party could be persuaded to run for president as a third-party candidate to give party voters uncomfortable with Trump a candidate to rally around.
Some speculation has centered around 2012 nominee Mitt Romney, who has been a frequent critic of Trump. Just this week Romney said Trump should release his tax records, a public disclosure move that Romney made in 2012 but which Trump has been resisting.Some Republicans have been urging Romney to launch an independent bid for the presidency. He discussed the issue last week with William Kristol, editor of the conservative-leaning Weekly Standard magazine, a source close to Romney said.

By Valerie Volcovici
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican presidential contender Donald Trump has asked one of America's most ardent drilling advocates and climate change skeptics to help him draft his energy policy.U.S. Republican Congressman Kevin Cramer of North Dakota - a major oil drilling state - is writing a white paper on energy policy for the New York billionaire, Cramer and sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.Cramer was also among a group of Trump advisers who recently met with lawmakers from western energy states, who hope Trump will open more federal land for drilling, a lawmaker who took part in the meeting said.Cramer said in an interview his paper would emphasize the dangers of foreign ownership of U.S. energy assets, burdensome taxes, and over-regulation. Trump will have an opportunity to float some of the ideas at an energy summit in Bismarck, North Dakota on May 26, Cramer said.A spokeswoman for Trump's campaign did not comment.While the ultimate size and makeup of Trump's energy advisory team is unclear, Cramer's inclusion suggests the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's oil policy could emphasize more drilling, less regulation and taxes, and curbs on efforts to combat climate change.
Cramer has said he believes the Earth is cooling, not warming, and he has opposed efforts by the Obama administration to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.Trump has been light on details of his energy policy so far, though he recently told supporters in West Virginia that the coal industry would thrive if he were in the White House. He has also claimed global warming is a concept ""created by and for the Chinese"" to hurt U.S. business.Trump only recently started building up teams of advisors on the economy, foreign policy and other issues to flesh out his platform for the Nov. 8 presidential election.
Cramer, North Dakota's only congressman and an early Congressional Trump supporter, encountered Trump when they were guests on a radio show last month and Trump spoke about relaxing regulation and expanding drilling. Trump's political team later asked Cramer to write the energy policy paper, the lawmaker said.""The real opportunity for prosperity in this country has been to produce more because you have access to more markets,"" Cramer said, referring to the recent lifting of a decades-old ban on oil exports. ""The last thing we need is more rules.""On foreign ownership of U.S. oil assets, Cramer said: ""One-third of refining capacity is owned by OPEC countries. How does this fit into his (Trump's) America first policy?"" 
OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Venezuela both have large stakes in U.S. refining capacity.Cramer said he expected energy policy to be a vulnerability for Hillary Clinton, the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination, in an election year where energy companies are going broke.Clinton has advocated shifting the country to 50 percent clean energy by 2030, promised heavy regulation of fracking, and said her prospective administration would put coal companies ""out of business.""

By Michelle Conlin
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Supporters of billionaire Donald Trump appear unfazed by his decision to accept money from outside donors, despite his earlier vow to self-fund his presidential campaign and his  criticism of rivals as puppets of wealthy special interests.The vow has been a cornerstone of Trump's election strategy to present himself as an outsider who is not in the pocket of rich donors, even though he has accepted more than $12 million in contributions so far. The strategy paid off last week when the New York businessman emerged as the Republican party's presumptive presidential nominee, after sweeping a series of state nominating contests.Since then, Trump has said he would no longer self-finance and would work with the party to raise more than $1 billion to help him fight his eventual Democratic Party challenger. Critics accused him of flip flopping, but some supporters don't agree.Three dozen of the 40 pro-Trump voters Reuters interviewed said they were not concerned about his reversal. Only four indicated the switch made them uneasy, though all of them said they would still support him.Most of those interviewed applauded the way the celebrity businessman billed himself as a ""blue-collar billionaire"" who didn't need other people's money, but said they understood Trump would need far more resources to compete in the general election.They would have no problem donating to the billionaire, albeit in the same kind of small increments that Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has used to build his nearly $200 million fundraising juggernaut. 
""Even though I'm on welfare, I would donate to Trump,"" said Pamela Thompson, a 46-year-old mother of three school-age kids from Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""And my kids would run a lemonade stand to help elect him.""The supporters interviewed said Trump's pledge to self-finance his campaign was less important to them than his promises to crack down on undocumented workers and ease the pain of mostly white, blue collar towns that have seen manufacturing jobs lost to developing countries.Sharon Jones, a 53-year old Wal-Mart cashier from Coleman County, Alabama, says her anger over undocumented immigrants shopping at her store on welfare benefits is animating her support for Trump, who has promised to deport undocumented workers and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.
""They are doing better than I am on my $9.45 an hour,"" Jones said.The majority of supporters interviewed said they thought Trump's decision to fundraise was strategically wise given that Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, has raised more than $250 million so far. In the 2012 election, Republican nominee Mitt Romney and his Democratic opponent, President Barack Obama, each raised $1 billion.
""You gotta fight fire with fire. Bring it on,"" said Cheryl Ressler Halvorson, a cattle rancher from Williston, North Dakota  whose support for Trump stems mainly from her ire over having to pay $1,100 a month for health insurance with a $13,000 deductible due to the government mandate known as Obamacare.Halvorson is not an outlier. Most Trump supporters have stayed loyal despite the candidate frequently reversing or updating policy positions on key economic and social issues.Trump is not the first U.S. presidential candidate to change his mind about financing his election campaign.In the 2008 election, Obama also did an about-face. He said he would forego public financing of his general election campaign against Republican John McCain. This was a reversal of his earlier stance and it allowed him to pursue a record fund-raising effort. Supporters were unfazed by the shift and Obama went on to win the election.

By Emily Flitter
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK The U.S. Secret Service is investigating presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's former butler over a Facebook post calling for President Barack Obama's assassination.The former butler, Anthony Senecal, 74, said in a Facebook post Obama should be hanged for treason. He made the statement in 2015, and the magazine Mother Jones wrote on Thursday about the post and other similar remarks by Senecal. Senecal worked for decades as a butler at Trump's Palm Beach mansion, Mar-a-Lago.After reports of Senecal's comments began to circulate, the Secret Service said in a statement, ""The U.S. Secret Service is aware of this matter and will conduct the appropriate investigation.""The story broke as Trump, whose proposals to ban Muslims from entering the United States and build a wall along the Mexican border have drawn heavy criticism, concluded a charm offensive on Capitol Hill. He attended a series of meetings there on Thursday with Republican lawmakers to try to win the party establishment's support for his candidacy.
Senecal has not served as a butler to the billionaire candidate since 2009, but he was identified in a March 15 profile in the New York Times as a current employee of Mar-a-Lago, serving as the estate's historian.Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, said in a statement, ""Senecal has not worked at Mar-a-Lago for years, but nevertheless we totally and completely disavow the horrible statements made by him regarding the president.""
She declined to comment on the Times report about Senecal's recent role. Senecal did not respond to a call seeking comment and could not be reached by email. ""It is time for our Military to drag that fraud out of the white mosque and hang his ass for treason and other high crimes against AMERICA !!!!!!!"" Senecal wrote on Sept. 13, 2015, in reference to Obama.
Mother Jones reached Senecal on Thursday. The magazine reported that Senecal said of his Facebook comments, including a private comment on Wednesday in which he said Obama should be shot: ""I wrote that. I believe that.""

By Susan Cornwell and Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump went on a charm offensive on Thursday to try to win the party establishment's support for his insurgent candidacy, but top Republican Paul Ryan stopped short of endorsing him.Trump was on his best behavior on a day of meetings with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill. He listened patiently as they raised concerns about his tone and the need to try to appeal to Hispanic voters.He avoided strident language, like the frequent criticism he has lobbed from the campaign trail that many lawmakers are awestruck by the corridors of power and forget why they were sent to Washington.""The whole discussion was very solid, reasonable and a warm and winning discussion,"" said Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah. ""I think you're going to find he's going to be better and better all the time."" The U.S. budget deficit and debt were among the issues Trump and Ryan discussed, sources familiar with the meeting said.Trump's day in Washington was aimed at laying to rest some of the concerns that persist among Republicans about his incendiary tone and some policy proposals at odds with party doctrine.The New York billionaire, who needs the party behind him to bolster his chances at winning the Nov. 8 election, has vowed to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, deport 11 million illegal immigrants, temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country and impose trade protectionist policies.Trump held an hour-long session with Ryan, who as speaker of the House of Representatives is the top U.S. elected Republican and can hold sway with many establishment Republicans leery of Trump.""This was our first meeting, but it was a very positive step toward unification,"" Ryan and Trump said in a joint statement.Trump told Fox News in an interview that he had a ""very, very good meeting"" with Ryan. ""I think Paul felt the same way and everybody else did also,"" Trump said.
Trump said he and Ryan largely agree on issues of border security, trade and beefing up the U.S. military. Party leaders are normally eager to rally around a presidential nominee to combine forces for the battle leading up to the general election. But Ryan has withheld his endorsement of Trump out of concern over the businessman's conservative credentials.In remarks to reporters after the meeting, the congressman said he was encouraged by the session but that more work will be needed.""There's no secret that Donald Trump and I have had our differences. We talked about those differences today,"" Ryan said at his weekly news conference. ""I do believe we are planting the seeds in getting ourselves unified.""Ryan, who may harbor aspirations of running for president in 2020 or later, noted that he represents a wing of the conservatives and that it is positive that Trump is bringing new voters into the party.
TONE IT DOWN
Despite his problems in winning over senior Republicans, Trump received a boost on Wednesday when a Reuters/Ipsos national poll showed him pulling even with likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The online survey found 41 percent of likely voters supporting Clinton and 40 percent backing Trump.            Later on Thursday, Trump went into a meeting with Senate     Republican leaders, where he posed for photos with them and heard concerns about his campaign rhetoric but appeared to make some progress in tempering concerns about him.""Everyone here wants you to win,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told him at the Senate session, a source said.
Senator Shelly Moore Capito of West Virginia urged Trump to be careful in his tone. Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a former U.S. trade representative, urged caution on his rhetoric against trade deals.""The issue of tone did come up,"" said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who said he gave some advice to Trump on ""the importance of the Hispanic vote and the whole idea of distinguishing between illegal immigration and legal immigration.""In a meeting at a Washington law firm, Trump sat down with James Baker, who served as secretary of state for Republican President George H.W. Bush.Earlier in the day, Baker had testified to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Under questioning from Senator Marco Rubio, a former Republican presidential candidate, Baker said the world ""would be far less stable"" without a strong NATO, a slap at Trump's idea of reconfiguring the Western alliance and getting European nations to foot more of the bill.""Secretary Baker had a meeting with Donald Trump that was requested by his campaign,"" a Baker spokesman said.Even Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina softened a bit. Graham dropped out of the presidential race earlier this year and had said the choice between Trump and rival Ted Cruz was like trying to decide between being ""shot or poisoned.""Graham said he had a ""cordial, pleasant conversation"" on the phone with Trump on Wednesday.""I know Mr. Trump is reaching out to many people, throughout the party and the country, to solicit their advice and opinions.  I believe this is a wise move on his part,"" said Graham.
