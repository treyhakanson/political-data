By Patrick Rucker and Dan Freed

U.S. Senate lawmakers excoriated Wells Fargo & Co's chief on Tuesday for his oversight of the bank as it opened 2 million bogus customer accounts, potentially laying the groundwork for new rules and reviving questions of whether banks are ""too big to fail."" Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday that customers who had bogus accounts opened in their name will be made whole and compensated for any damage to their credit rating, but some Democratic senators called for his resignation.Under fire, Stumpf said he has told his managers to do ""whatever it takes"" to make customers whole, refunding fees or compensating them for damage to their credit ratings. But he stood behind the former executive who ran the unit that oversaw many of the practices, and at times downplayed the scope of the affair.In answer to a question, he declined to commit to setting aside mandatory arbitration agreements that prohibit clients from suing Wells Fargo. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau has proposed a ban on such clauses that prohibit class-action lawsuits.Earlier this month, the lender agreed to pay $190 million in penalties and customer payouts to settle the case involving the creation of credit, savings and other accounts without customers' knowledge. About $5 million will directly go to customers, many of whom might have paid a small fee on the unwanted accounts.The revelations are a severe hit to Wells Fargo's reputation. During the financial crisis, the bank trumpeted itself as conservative, in contrast to its rivals. Besides potential criminal charges against the company and its executives, Wells Fargo may face pressure from shareholders to change its practices on executive pay and governance. The scandal also renewed debate over whether U.S. banks are ""too big to fail"" and need closer government oversight to prevent a massive collapse. Lawmakers could use the fraud settlement as a springboard for new rules on executive pay, including clawbacks of compensation, and limits on forced arbitration.Wells Fargo has said its board will assess whether to cancel or claw back any incentive compensation paid to a now-retired executive at the center of the scandal, Carrie Tolstedt. Democratic Senators Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called for Stumpf to resign, with Warren saying Stumpf should give back his salary and be criminally investigated. 
""You should resign. You should give back the money you took while this scam was going on, and you should be criminally investigated,"" Warren said. The bank's board of directors is examining what action it should take against company executives, Stumpf told the committee.        ""I accept full responsibility for all unethical sales practices,"" Stumpf said, adding later, ""I apologize to all of the American people and our customers, and I will make it right."" Lawmakers said the phony bank accounts might have hurt customer credit ratings, increased the cost of a mortgage or car loan. New credit card applications and consumer borrowing trends can weight on an individual's credit.""WHERE WAS MANAGEMENT?"" 

Wells Fargo has acknowledged bank employees ""inappropriately opened"" the customer accounts and that about 5,300 employees were fired over five years.Former bank employees say they were under intense pressure to add accounts for each customer.    Abuses were found as early as 2011, Stumpf said, but bank executives only realized the scale of the problem early last year.At that time, Stumpf said, managers came to recognize how a pattern of creating phony accounts could be used to boost unwarranted fees.""It never dawned on us that there could be a cycle,"" the CEO said.""It just sort of begs the issue of where was management,"" said Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the panel.
Brown said employees were caught ""forging signatures, and stealing identities, Social Security numbers, and customers' hard-earned cash, so as to hang on to their low-paying jobs and make money for the high-paying executives at Wells Fargo.""Thomas Curry, the Comptroller of the Currency, said the agency is considering action against individual Wells Fargo executives who may have violated laws or regulations. The U.S. Attorney's Offices in Manhattan and in San Francisco are investigating Wells Fargo, a person familiar with the matter said last week. While Democratic lawmakers were the most outspoken in their attacks, Republicans also grilled Stumpf.Louisiana Senator David Vitter pressed the CEO on how  customer fraud could persist for years and thousands of employees could be fired before the head of the bank got involved.""Why isn't this crystal clear proof that an entity as big as Wells is not only too big to fail but it's too big to manage and too big to regulate?"" Vitter asked.Stumpf said the widespread abuse was ""a problem of focus and not of size.""Stumpf appeared before the congressional panel with a bandaged right hand. He suffered an injury playing with his grandchildren, according to the bank. Wells Fargo shares rose 2 percent to $46.94.

WASHINGTON Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took on the Wells Fargo & Co bogus-accounts case in a letter to the bank's customers to be released on Tuesday, when Wells Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf will testify before a Senate committee.Clinton, who faced accusations during her party's primary elections of representing Wall Street's interests, said in the letter that Stumpf ""owes all of you a clear explanation as to how this happened under his watch."" Earlier this month, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators announced a $185 million settlement with the bank for creating 2 million phantom accounts under actual customers' names in a bid to meet internal sales goals.
In the letter sent to customers, Clinton laid out a three-prong plan to address what she called ""the culture of misconduct and recklessness"" in the banking system. It included ""clawing back"" the compensation of individual executives involved in wrongdoing and breaking up big banks that are not managed effectively. She also called for maintaining the CFPB, an agency created in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that Republican lawmakers would like to reorganize.

By Suzanne Barlyn

Wells Fargo & Co customers aiming to sue the bank over bogus accounts opened in their names may be in for an unpleasant surprise: the fine print requires them to take their claims to an arbitrator instead of a court.Mandatory arbitration rules inserted into account-opening agreements prohibit customers from joining class actions or suing the third-largest U.S. bank in court. Instead, the agreements require individual, closed-door arbitration. U.S. senators highlighted the issue on Tuesday as they grilled Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf during a hearing.Asked if he would set aside the mandatory arbitration agreements for customers affected by the phantom accounts, Stumpf demurred.""I'm not an expert in that,"" he said, adding he would talk to his legal team.That was not enough for some lawmakers.
""If we had class action on this in 2010, 2009, 2008, the problem never would have gotten so out of hand,"" Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said later, when questioning regulators about the practice.Class actions can be more affordable for unhappy customers, especially those with limited resources, because they can band together to sue, rather than having to hire lawyers individually. Consumers also complain that target companies often choose the arbitrators; proceedings are confidential; and decisions are hard to appeal.Three Wells Fargo customers filed a lawsuit Friday in a Utah federal court, seeking class action status on behalf of hundreds of thousands of customers nationwide they say were harmed by the San Francisco-based bank's fraud and recklessness.It was unclear whether they could get around the mandatory arbitration clauses, though. Last year, Wells successfully invoked the clauses to defend against a class action suit tied to bogus accounts.
In that case, the judge said customers had to arbitrate because of agreements they signed when opening legitimate accounts at the bank.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a brainchild of Warren, was part of the regulatory group that negotiated a $190 million settlement from Wells Fargo over the bogus accounts.The bureau is considering rules to ban banks, credit card issuers and other companies from forcing customers to submit to arbitration and waive their right to join class action lawsuits.
Under the proposal, companies could still use arbitration, but would have to tell consumers they could join class action lawsuits instead.Mandating arbitration when signing up for financial products has become standard practice after a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court decision validated the practice.Still, the tide may be turning, said Joseph Peiffer, a New Orleans lawyer who has represented investors and others in class action lawsuits. ""Class actions dissuade companies from ripping people off a thousand dollars here and a thousand dollars there,"" Peiffer said. (Reporting by Suzanne Barlyn.

NEW YORK The White House said on Tuesday it is trying to persuade Congress not to press ahead with a bill that would allow survivors and families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue the government of Saudi Arabia for damages, in an apparent effort to avoid having a presidential veto overridden.White House spokesman Josh Earnest, speaking during a press briefing in New York, repeated a promise that President Barack Obama would veto the bill, which has been passed by both houses of Congress, but said there was a push to change legislators' minds about the law. ""White House officials and other senior officials on the president's national security team have engaged members of Congress and their staffs in both parties in both houses,"" Earnest said.Congressional aides have said the measure appeared to have enough support, two-thirds majorities in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, for lawmakers to override an Obama veto for the first time since he took office in January 2009.
The Senate sent the bill to Obama last week, giving him a 10-day window, which ends on Sept. 23, to veto the measure.
""We're going to continue that engagement up to and through the president vetoing this legislation in the hopes that we can find an alternative that preserves the effective response that we've already designed to counter state sponsors of terrorism rather than leaving that designation subject to individual decisions by individual judges,"" Earnest said.     The bill could lead to U.S. diplomats, service members and companies being taken to court all over the world because it would erode the principle of sovereign immunity, he said.

WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate will vote on Wednesday on a measure to block the sale of tanks and other military equipment worth $1.15 billion to Saudi Arabia, but the measure is not expected to pass despite lawmakers' growing frustration with the longtime U.S. ally.The Senate's Republican Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, said on Tuesday he would ""aggressively"" oppose the effort. ""I think it's important to the United States to maintain as good a relationship with Saudi Arabia as possible, and I hope we'll defeat the resolution of disapproval of the arms sale,"" McConnell told reporters, calling Saudi Arabia a good ally.The Pentagon announced on Aug. 9 that the State Department had approved the potential sale of more than 130 Abrams battle tanks, 20 armored recovery vehicles and other equipment to Saudi Arabia. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency said General Dynamics Corp would be the principal contractor for the sale.A bipartisan group of senators, led by Republican Rand Paul and Democrat Chris Murphy, introduced a joint resolution seeking to block the arms deal, expressing concern that Saudi-led air strikes had killed civilians in Yemen, worries that the deal might fuel a regional arms race and concern that Congress was giving up its power to declare war.
""We should be part of the debate over whether or not we go to war. But then we should debate the practicalities of whether or not it's a good idea to be involved in the war in Yemen,"" Paul told Reuters.Paul said the conflict could lead to instability and perhaps the rise of a militant group in Yemen, as Islamic State did in Syria.
The resolution also underscores concerns over what many in Congress see as Riyadh's international promotion of a severe form of Islam they view as hostile to U.S. interests.""We've let them get away with it for years and years. And because they're less bad than other people in the Middle East, we keep giving them weapons,"" Paul said.Democratic Representative Ted Lieu and Republican Representative Mick Mulvaney introduced companion legislation on Tuesday seeking to block the sale in the House of Representatives.
Lieu in August sent a letter signed by 64 lawmakers asking U.S. President Barack Obama to postpone the sale.Separately, Congress could vote this week to override Obama's promised veto of a measure allowing relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue the Saudi government.

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican U.S. lawmakers launched an effort on Tuesday to modify a $38 billion military aid agreement with Israel by providing more money and easing controls on how it is spent, setting up a showdown with President Barack Obama over the package days after it was signed.Senators Lindsey Graham, Kelly Ayotte, John McCain and Ted Cruz told a news conference they had filed a measure to give Israel an additional $1.5 billion in military aid, while renewing U.S. sanctions on Iran.Republican Senators Mark Kirk, Marco Rubio and Roy Blunt also co-sponsored the bill introduced on Tuesday.Ayotte, McCain, Kirk, Rubio and Blunt all face competitive races for re-election on Nov. 8.Arguing that U.S. law gives Congress control of spending, they objected to a provision preventing Israel from asking for additional funds from Congress after the new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), begins at the end of fiscal 2018.
""This is a very dramatic moment in the U.S.-Israel relationship between Congress and the state of Israel. Congress is not going to sit on the sidelines,"" Graham said.The senators also object to Israel's agreement to return any money if Congress tries to send it more than $3.8 billion per year before then.Graham said he would introduce legislation to overturn a provision in the agreement that phased out an arrangement that has allowed Israel to spend 26.3 percent of U.S. military aid on its own defense industry instead of on U.S. weapons.
U.S. and Israeli officials signed the agreement on Wednesday. The 10-year package is the largest in U.S. history. It was reached after nearly 10 months of negotiations that underscored continuing friction between Obama and Israeli Prime  Minister Netanyahu.But Netanyahu decided it would be best to forge a new arrangement with Obama, who leaves office in January, rather than hoping for better terms from the next U.S. administration, according to officials on both sides.The senators insisted that Netanyahu was forced into signing because Israel's arch-enemy Iran is growing stronger as it obtains billions of dollars unfrozen under an international nuclear agreement reached last year.
""Now is not the time to say that we're going to nickel and dime Israel,"" Graham said.Congressional Republicans strongly oppose the nuclear pact. They angered the White House in 2015 by inviting Netanyahu to give an address to Congress opposing it.They have offered several pieces of legislation to overturn or undermine the nuclear deal, and sought to make it an issue in the 2016 U.S. elections.

WASHINGTON Hundreds of top scientists warned on Tuesday against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's vow to pull the United States out of the Paris climate-warming accord if elected in November.The 375 members of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, including 30 Nobel Prize winners, said in an open letter that a U.S. abandonment of the agreement would make it far harder to develop global strategies to lessen the impact of global warming.""Thus it is of great concern that the Republican nominee for President has advocated U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Accord,"" the letter said.""A 'Parexit' would send a clear signal to the rest of the world: 'The United States does not care about the global problem of human-caused climate change. You are on your own.'""Among the signers are biologist E.O. Wilson, physicists Stephen Hawking and Claude Canizares, astrophysicist Simon D.M. White, and Nobel winners Thomas Steitz, Michael Levitt and William Daniel Phillips.
The National Academy of Sciences is a private society of scholars who advise the United States on science and  technological matters. The signers of the letter said they did so as individuals and not on behalf of the Academy or their institutions.In Paris last December, almost 200 countries agreed to slash greenhouse gases and keep global temperature rises to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius. The United States and China, the two largest producers of carbon emissions, ratified the accord this month.
Trump will speak at a natural gas industry conference in Pennsylvania on Thursday. A Trump spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.Trump has dismissed manmade climate change as a hoax invented by the Chinese and says he will abandon the Paris agreement if elected.He has vowed to reverse much of the work the administration of President Barack Obama has done to address climate change, including rules to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
The Republican Party platform also questions the legality of Obama's executive order ratifying the Paris deal.Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is a strong supporter of the Paris accord. (Additional reporting by Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Leslie Adler)"

DALLAS Former U.S. President George W. Bush on Tuesday entered the debate over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, hosting a forum at his presidential library extolling his successor's Asian free trade deal.Bush, who signed several such accords during his two terms in office, met with U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman before the event to promote the strategic benefits of the agreement.President Barack Obama is still pushing for Congress to approve the 12-country TPP following the Nov. 8 presidential election, even though both Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton oppose it. Bush, who has largely stayed out of the campaign - in which Trump's anti-trade rhetoric fueled his rise to the Republican nomination - did not attend the forum at the George W. Bush Institute in Dallas.""I'm very grateful for him welcoming me to this institute and having the institute host this important conversation,"" Froman told the audience of largely business people after his meeting with Bush. ""And I'm very grateful for his support of free trade as well."" 
Ken Hersh, director of the Bush Institute, called TPP ""a no-brainer on a whole host of fronts."" The forum followed a similar event on Monday night in Houston where Froman enlisted the help of another Republican free-trader, James Baker, who served the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush as secretary of the Treasury and secretary of state, respectively.""Both major party candidates for the presidency oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. And guess what? They're both wrong,"" Baker, 86, said at the Rice University institute that bears his name.
""I've often found myself in disagreement with President Obama. But on TPP I am with him, and I am with him 100 percent,"" Baker added.In a speech at the Houston event, Froman emphasized the need for TPP as a counterbalance to China's growing economic and political influence in Asia, citing its own regional trade deal and more assertive stance in the South China Sea.  
""If we don't act, it will create a vacuum. These economies aren't going to stand still. Beijing will step in to fill the void,"" Froman said.  At the Bush Institute, Susan Schwab, who served as George W. Bush's last trade representative, said failure to pass TPP would mark an abdication of U.S. leadership.""There are countries out there that would dearly love to see the United States fall on its face by not enacting, by not ratifying this deal,"" she said.

By Amy Tennery
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK The maker of Skittles candies on Tuesday objected to a social media post by Donald Trump Jr. in which the Republican presidential hopeful's son compared admitting Syrian refugees to the United States to eating poisoned pieces of the brightly colored, fruit-flavored treats.Candidate Donald Trump has opposed letting Syrian refugees enter, while his Democratic rival in the Nov. 8 election, Hillary Clinton, has supported accepting some of those fleeing the war-torn country.In a post on Twitter on Monday accompanied by an image of the candy, Donald Trump Jr. wrote, ""If I had a bowl of Skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem.""A spokeswoman for Skittles maker Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co said the company did not feel Trump's analogy was appropriate.""Skittles are candy. Refugees are people,"" said spokeswoman Michelle Green, adding that the Mars Inc [MARSIW.UL] subsidiary would refrain from further comment, ""as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing.""U.S. admission of Syrian refugees has long been a politically sensitive issue, although the country has admitted far fewer than many close allies. Trump has said violent militants could enter the country posing as refugees.
In 2015, Democratic President Barack Obama announced plans  to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees this year, sparking fierce criticism, mostly from Republicans who said the plan could put Americans at risk. His administration announced in August that it would meet that goal.The younger Trump's tweet drew return fire from the Clinton campaign and many Twitter users.""Thankful my grandfather was allowed into this country and not compared to a poisonous skittle,"" Josh Schwerin, a Clinton spokesman, posted on Monday.Twitter user Neal Rogers on Tuesday, tweeted, ""I'd rather die eating a handful of Skittles than live a single day with @realDonaldTrump as president.""
Trump's running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, hit back at the Skittles criticism in an NBC News interview.""It is remarkable to me to see the level of outrage about a metaphor used by (Donald Trump Jr.) when Hillary Clinton's calling for a 550 percent increase in the Syrian refugee program,"" Pence said.A year ago, Clinton said she supported the admission of 65,000 Syrian refugees. The former U.S. secretary of state has not updated that figure in recent months but says all refugees should be vetted.
The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on Pence's remarks.Trump adviser Jack Kingston, a former U.S. congressman from Georgia, also defended the tweet in an interview with MSNBC.""What he was doing was making an illustration. I don't think he was comparing refugees to candy at all,"" he said.The hashtag #SkittlesWelcome was trending on Twitter in the United States, as social media users mocked the tweet.

NBC did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday about Holt's party affiliation.Trump has said repeatedly the presidential debates will be stacked against him. He said on Fox News on Monday that Holt was a ""professional"" but that he was a Democrat, adding that the NBC News anchor may be under pressure after critics accused fellow NBC journalist Matt Lauer of giving Clinton tougher treatment than Trump during a recent forum on defense issues.    ""Look, it's a phony system. Lester is a Democrat. I mean, they are all Democrats. OK? It's a very unfair system,"" Trump said on the show.
Bill O'Reilly, the Fox News host conducting the interview, said two other debate moderators, ABC's Martha Raddatz and CNN's Anderson Cooper, were also Democrats. 
Cooper is registered in New York with no party affiliation, according to the state elections site, which CNN confirmed. ABC did not respond to a request for comment about Raddatz's registration.The fourth presidential debate moderator, Chris Wallace of Fox News, is a registered Democrat in Washington, D.C., according to the District's elections website. Wallace has said in interviews that he registered with the party so he could vote in primaries in the heavily Democratic District of Columbia.
