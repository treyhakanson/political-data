By Scott Malone

BOSTON Many opinion polls show Democrat Hillary Clinton leading Republican Donald Trump in a tight race for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, but any one of four factors may make the outcome harder to predict.Among the challenges for pollsters: The historic unpopularity of both candidates, the potential Election Day voter response to the polls themselves, the growing abandonment of landlines for cellphones, and the rise of online polling.Some high-profile stumbles worldwide - including opinion polls that missed Colombia's Oct. 2 rejection of a peace deal - underscore how technological, social and cultural shifts have made polling more difficult than ever.An average of polls compiled by RealClearPolitics.com shows former Secretary of State Clinton beating Trump, a businessman, by 5.4 percentage points. Highlighting the difficulties, the range varies from plus-13 for Clinton to a straight tie.Trump has said the election is rigged against him and this week, in a Reuters interview, he accused media organizations of tilting the polls deliberately, but he has yet to offer any widely accepted evidence to back up these claims.Voter turnout in the last few presidential elections has been about 60 percent. But given both candidates' low overall popularity, turnout this year may fall to as low as 52 percent, said Cliff Zukin, a professor emeritus of political science at New Jersey's Rutgers University and a former president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research. That makes it hard to guess who might stay home.""It's always been difficult to simulate a likely electorate and I think that's harder to do in 2016,"" Zukin said.POLLING MAY AFFECT TURNOUT
A second pitfall is the effect of the polling itself on voters. Sociologists believe polls can weaken projected winners by making their supporters more confident of the outcome and, therefore, less likely to vote. The percentage of Trump supporters who expect him to win has dropped to 49 percent in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from Oct. 20-24, down from 74 percent from Sept. 16-20. Clinton supporters' confidence rose at the same time.
If that leads to a higher turnout of Trump supporters than of Clinton supporters, it might affect the election outcome.Pollsters caution, however, that the effect of polls on the electorate can only go so far.    ""If it were showing Clinton up by 2 points, then it's certainly possible that it would be within the margin of error that Trump might win,"" said Douglas Schwartz, director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.""But if you're finding that all of these high-quality polls are showing Clinton consistently ahead, then I think you can trust them,"" he said.CELLPHONES AN ISSUE

One of the biggest factors in polling today is the prevalence of cellphones. About half of Americans have only a cellphone and no landline, according to Federal Communications Commission data, more than double the number who were wireless-only in 2010. This makes it harder and more expensive for pollsters to gather a truly random sample of opinions because U.S. law prohibits computerized auto-dialing (also known as robocalls) to cellphones and there is no central directory for cellphones. Polling cellphones can costs 30 to 50 percent more than polling land lines due to requirements that the numbers be dialed manually, according to Pew Research Center estimates. This has led polling outfits to generally rely on lower sample sizes to come up with results.Calls to cellphones are also more easily screened by their users, and as a result pollsters say they connect with just 10 percent of people they try to contact, down from 80 percent a few decades ago. But Courtney Kennedy, director of survey research at Pew said, ""In terms of data, the quality is better."" Many respondents on cellphones are young and racially diverse, she said.
ONLINE SURVEYS A FACTOR
Others, such as Reuters/Ipsos, conduct surveys online. This allows them to reach large numbers of people at lower cost. But because participants are volunteers in many cases, rather than selected at random, segments of the electorate may be left out.    The lower or skewed response in both cellphone and online polls can pose a challenge with pollsters having to adjust results to match the real world. To accomplish this, they weight more heavily the opinions of types of voters under-represented in their surveys.Pollsters use population statistics, experience and intuition to do this. For instance, if the proportion of men who respond to a survey is lower than their proportion of the overall population, the pollster will adjust the finding to try to even that out.""Then you've built in an assumption that the males that didn't respond are like the males that responded. And that's an unknowable fact,"" said Robert Groves, provost of Georgetown University, a social statistician and author of seven books on polling who served as director of the U.S. Census Bureau from 2009 through 2012.But such modeling can work well in some cases.A study by Columbia University statisticians, published in 2014 in the International Journal of Forecasting, showed that a poll of users of Microsoft Corp's Xbox gaming system could be used to accurately predict the election's outcome.The gamers were far younger, whiter and more male than the U.S. electorate and predicted a sweeping victory for Republican Mitt Romney in 2012. But when the results were weighted according to voters who turned out in 2008, they predicted President Barack Obama's 2012 re-election.Getting the weightings right this time could be a tougher job because Trump has attracted many supporters who historically have voted erratically, or not at all.""We can't apply 2008 and 2012 models to 2016,"" said Ashley Koning, director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University.

By Steve Holland and Jeff Mason

TOLEDO, Ohio; WINSTON SALEM, N.C. U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump criticized Democrat Hillary Clinton on Thursday over her trade policies, saying she would handle trade deals so badly that the country should ""just cancel the election"" and name him the victor. Speaking to supporters in Toledo, Ohio, Trump said the North American Free Trade Agreement signed by Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, had led to the outsourcing of thousands of Ohio jobs to Mexico, a practice he vowed to stop if elected president on Nov. 8.""We should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump, right?"" he said. ""What are we even having it for? Her policies are so bad.""Trump said he believed Clinton would seek passage of the 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership, President Barack Obama's signature Asian trade deal, which she now opposes.Trump's remarks came as the New York businessman tries to steady rocky poll numbers amid a series of controversies and self-inflicted wounds. He has struggled to handle the fallout from the release of a 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" video that showed the then-reality TV star talking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. The video was taped only months after Trump married his third wife, Melania.Trump said on Thursday it was ""certainly illegal"" for NBC to release the tape and he left open the option of seeking legal action against the network after the election.Since the video's release, a series of women have accused Trump of groping them or kissing them without their consent. Trump has called the allegations ""absolutely false.""The latest RealClearPolitics poll average showed Clinton with a nearly 6-point national lead over Trump, fueled by declining support among women for his candidacy.Trump, without evidence, has blamed his sagging poll numbers on a rigged election, and said the media had fixed the opinion polls in order to inflate Clinton's numbers.
Numerous studies have shown that voter fraud in U.S. elections is very rare, and a number of prominent Republicans have denounced Trump's claim that the system is unsound.While Trump campaigned in  Ohio, a plane carrying his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, skidded off the runway after landing at New York City's LaGuardia Airport on Thursday night. There were no injuries, the Pence campaign said.STUMPING WITH FIRST LADY
Clinton on Thursday made her first joint campaign appearance with one of her most powerful supporters, first lady Michelle Obama, at a North Carolina rally to urge young people and women to vote.Clinton, a former first lady who lost the 2008 Democratic nomination to then-U.S. Senator Barack Obama before becoming his secretary of state, praised Michelle Obama for standing up for the rights of girls and women worldwide, drawing a sharp contrast with her Republican rival.
""I wish I didn't have to say this. ... But indeed, dignity and respect for women and girls is also on the ballot in this election,"" Clinton told a crowd of about 11,000. ""And I want to thank our first lady for her eloquent, powerful defense of that basic value.""Michelle Obama's stinging denunciation of Trump after a leaked 2005 video showed him making lewd remarks and bragging about groping women was seen by many as one of the campaign's most striking condemnations of the New York businessman.Without naming Trump, Obama took him to task again in North Carolina, asking the crowd which candidate they wanted to represent their daughters from the White House.""We want a president who takes this job seriously, and has the temperament and maturity to do it well. Someone who is steady. Someone who we can trust with the nuclear codes,"" Obama said. ""I would not be here lying to you: I believe with all of my heart that Hillary Clinton will be that president,"" she said.
Although Michelle Obama was critical of Clinton during the hard-fought 2008 Democratic nominating race, any trace of bitterness appeared long behind them. The two women showed an easy rapport. They embraced and smiled. Obama called Clinton ""my girl"" and made a point of telling the crowd they were tight.""If people wonder: Yes, Hillary Clinton is my friend,"" she said.Clinton promised to take good care of Obama's White House vegetable garden if she won and wistfully praised the athletic first lady's dancing skills. ""One could only hope,"" Clinton said.She also lauded Obama's work for children and military families and in what was perhaps a nod to African-Americans she hopes will vote for her in the state, said Obama had faced challenges she had not as a presidential spouse.""Let's be real. As our first African-American first lady, she's faced pressures I never did, and she's handled them with pure grace,"" Clinton said to applause.Although a sometimes reluctant campaigner, the first lady has thrown herself into the race, and the Clinton campaign has deployed her strategically to increase support among young people and blacks, with whom she is especially popular.

By Anthony Boadle
| BRASILIA

BRASILIA A Brazilian prosecutor investigating potentially corrupt investments made by state pension funds said the real estate company run by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump appears to have benefited ""suspiciously"" from a massive redevelopment of Rio de Janeiro's port ahead of the Olympics.The development, known as Porto Maravilha, or Marvelous Port in Portuguese, cost 8 billion reais ($2.5 billion) and developed run-down docklands into a plaza, museums, corporate and residential real estate. As part of the project, five 38-story buildings were meant to be erected under the Trump brand. Public prosecutor Alselmo Lopes said in a court filing made public on Thursday that he is investigating the Porto Maravilha deal, in which the national employee severance fund FGTS, managed by state-bank Caixa Economica Federal [CEF.UL], paid up-front for building rights which it then sold on.     The structuring of the Porto Maravilha deal ""favored, in a suspicious way, the Trump Organization economic group"", among others, Lopes said. The prosecutor gave no further details and was not immediately reachable for comment. His spokeswoman, Dionne Tiago, said Lopes would not explain the basis for his suspicions until next week. 
None of the five people Lopes sought to charge in the court filing for siphoning off 8 billion reais from the Caixa's pension fund were related to the Trump Organization.  The Trump Organization, which sold naming rights for the Rio towers but did not provide any funding for the project, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A senior executive involved in the Trump Towers Rio dismissed the prosecutor's charge as baseless.
""Any allegations that the Porto Maravilha Investment Fund of Caixa Economica Federal has favored in a suspicious way the Trump Organization economic group are completely unfounded,"" the executive, who asked not to be named, said by email. Not long after plans for the towers were first announced, Donald Trump tweeted in January 2013: ""The Trump Organization is going revolutionize Rio de Janeiro's downtown port area with Trump Towers. Construction begins soon!"" 
Two of the five Trump Towers were supposed to be ready by the Olympics, but ground has yet to be broken. Developers say the project is still going ahead and has not been scrapped.Trump Towers Rio on its website claims it is the first project in Brazil to bear the name of the U.S. real estate magnate and the largest urban office development in the BRICS group of leading emerging market countries.

GENEVA, Ohio Donald Trump shrugged off tough talk from Vice President Joe Biden with a verbal counter punch of his own.At a rally in Geneva, Ohio, the Republican presidential nominee on Thursday night addressed Biden's remark last week that he would like to take Trump ""behind the gym"" to punish him for videotaped remarks in 2005 in which Trump boasted about groping women.""You know what you do with Biden? You go like this,"" Trump said, then turned to the side to blow out a puff of air from his mouth. ""And he'd fall over.""Trump is 70 years old. Biden is 73. Both have been known to delve into hyperbole.
Biden had said at a campaign event for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania that he is frequently asked whether he wished he had been debating Trump. Biden had flirted with running for president this year.""No, I wish we were in high school. I could take him behind the gym. That's what I wish,"" Biden said.
Trump said if he had ever made a statement like that about Biden the news media would be outraged.""Can you imagine if I ever made that statement? 'Donald trump is a bully! He threatened Vice President Biden!' But everybody said 'oh, that was a wonderful statement,'"" Trump said.
""I dream about Biden,"" Trump added. ""Boy, that would be easy. That would be an easy one."" (Reporting By Steve Holland; Editing by Bernard Orr)"

NEW YORK With the U.S. election just days away, Americans can expect to see an occasional ""nasty woman"" and ""basket of deplorables"" knocking on doors this Halloween alongside the usual parade of goblins, ghosts and ghouls.Revelers are planning costumes inspired by the campaign for the Nov. 8 election, seeking catharsis and humor at the end of the often bitterly fought White House race between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton.Ted Wright, a marketing executive from Atlanta, said he and his wife were planning to dress as a ""bad hombre"" and ""nasty woman,"" respectively, references to Trump's much-ridiculed remarks about some Mexican immigrants and Clinton during a presidential debate on Oct. 19.""This is one of those elections where it's very difficult to discuss [it] in polite company,"" said Wright, 49, a Republican who said he would not vote for Trump. ""That is why we're going 'bad hombre' and we're going 'nasty woman.'""Hannah Hemperly, a 22-year-old recent college graduate, said she planned to dress up as a ""nasty woman"" as well.
""When (Trump) was calling (Clinton) a 'nasty woman,' I think I just felt solidarity with Hillary,"" said Hemperly, who lives in Chicago and planned to vote for the Democratic nominee. Jake West, who works at a Chicago-area architecture firm, said he was going to assemble a group of friends to dress as a ""basket of deplorables,"" a reference to Clinton's infamous put-down during a fundraiser of some Trump supporters.West, 43, latched onto the idea ""because that word, that phrase, 'basket of deplorables' has been flying around so much.""
More traditional election-related costumes were also popular ahead of the fancy dress parties and parades planned for the days around Halloween, Oct. 31.Foam Clinton and Trump masks priced at $12.99 were among the top-sellers at Spirit Halloween, according to a spokeswoman for the chain, which specializes in costumes and party supplies. By Wednesday, the Clinton mask had sold out online.
Corey Campbell of Virginia said he would shave his beard to mark a briefly famous moment in the campaign. Campbell planned to dress as Ken Bone, the mustachioed, red sweater-wearing audience member who became a social media sensation after he cut into the campaign acrimony to ask an earnest question about energy policy during a town hall presidential debate on Oct. 9.Campbell, who said he was leaning toward voting for Trump, called Bone ""a bright moment in this crazy campaign cycle.""""I think the only way you could not have a little campaign fatigue after this cycle is if you haven't been paying attention.""

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama on Thursday urged more than 25,000 volunteers and advocates who dialed in to a White House conference call to pull out the stops to boost the number of people signing up for Obamacare health insurance plans.Obama warned it will be challenging to overcome the skepticism about the plans given an onslaught of headlines about surging premium prices, but he said the stakes are high.""I think we're at a critical time where we have to show that this program works for people, if they just see what their options are,"" he told the volunteers, who work in their communities to encourage and assist enrollment.Americans who do not receive health insurance through their employer or through Medicare or Medicaid programs shop online for subsidized insurance plans starting Nov. 1 until the end of January.The average premium for benchmark 2017 plans sold on healthcare.gov rose 25 percent compared with 2016.
Obama said tax credits will help more than seven in 10 shoppers get a plan for less than $75 per month, but said many may not bother looking because they have heard about spiking costs.""We're going to have to clear the bugs off the windshield so people can see the road ahead, and that's where you guys come in,"" Obama said.The law has been fought by Republicans in Congress, who said it creates unwarranted government intervention in personal healthcare and private industry.
Several big insurers, including UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N), Aetna Inc (AET.N) and Humana Inc (HUM.N), are pulling out of the online marketplaces selling the subsidized plans, citing bigger-than-expected financial losses.Aetna Chief Executive Mark Bertolini said on Thursday that the earliest his company may return to the marketplaces would be 2019.
Obama said more young and healthy people need to sign up for plans. That would offset insurers' costs of covering members with serious illnesses.Obama has said there are a series of improvements that could be made to his signature domestic policy achievement - the 2010 Affordable Care Act - if Congress and the next president, who will take office on Jan. 20, can work together.""Part of what we can do this time is to overcome the skeptics, to prove people wrong, and to provide momentum so that when the next administration comes in, they are starting from a position of strength,"" Obama told the conference call.

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama shortened the prison sentences for 98 convicts serving time for drug-related offenses in his latest round of commutations, including for 42 people serving life sentences, the White House said on Thursday.Obama has granted 688 commutations this year, for a total so far of 872 during his presidency, which ends on Jan. 20.""These are individuals - many of whom made mistakes at a young age - who have diligently worked to rehabilitate themselves while incarcerated,"" White House Counsel Neil Eggleston said in a statement.
The commutations are part of Obama's push to reform the criminal justice system to reduce the number of people serving long sentences for non-violent drug offenses.
Obama and a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the U.S. Congress had tried to work on legislation to reduce mandatory minimum sentences, but those efforts stalled ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election.

By Dustin Volz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A bipartisan group of lawmakers in the U.S. Congress on Thursday asked the Justice Department to clarify how a looming rule change to the government's hacking powers could impact privacy rights of innocent Americans.The change, due to take place on December 1, would let judges issue search warrants for remote access to computers located in any jurisdiction, potentially including foreign countries. Magistrate judges can normally only order searches within the jurisdiction of their court, which is typically limited to a few counties.""We are concerned about the full scope of the new authority that would be provided to the Department of Justice,"" 23 senators and representatives wrote to Attorney General Loretta Lynch.The Supreme Court in April approved amendments to Rule 41 of the federal rules of criminal procedure that would allow judges to issue warrants in cases when a suspect uses anonymizing technology to conceal the location of his or her computer or for an investigation into a network of hacked or infected computers, such as a botnet. 
Those amendments will take effect on December 1 of this year unless Congress passes legislation that would reject, amend or postpone the changes. Some lawmakers, led by Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, have introduced legislation that would halt the changes, but it has yet to gain much traction.In their letter, the lawmakers asked how the government would prevent under the expanded rule so-called ""forum shopping,"" where prosecutors seek warrants in districts considered more favorable to law enforcement. 
They also asked how the Justice Department intends to notify users when electronic devices have been searched and whether law enforcement has the authority to disable malicious software on a protected device, including those belonging to innocent Americans, among other questions. The Justice Department has worked on Rule 41 changes for years, arguing they are procedural in nature and necessary to keep pace with criminal threats posed by evolving technology.
Civil liberties groups and some technology companies, including Alphabet Inc's Google, have said the changes could allow for searches that run afoul of privacy rights.The Justice Department is reviewing the lawmakers' letter, which asked for a response within two weeks, spokesman Peter Carr said.

By Gleb Stolyarov
| KRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia

KRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia President Vladimir Putin on Thursday accused American politicians of whipping up hysteria about a mythical Russian threat as a ploy to distract voters from their own failings in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election.Putin, addressing an audience of foreign policy experts gathered in southern Russia, repeatedly lashed out at the Obama administration, saying it did not keep its word on Syria, did not honour deals, and had falsely accused Moscow of all manner of sins.    The U.S. government has formally accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organisations, while Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has accused Republican rival Donald Trump of being a Putin ""puppet"".Putin said he found it hard to believe that anyone seriously thought Moscow was capable of influencing the Nov. 8 election.""Hysteria has been whipped up,"" said Putin. He said that was a ruse to cover up for the fact that the U.S. political elite had nothing to say about serious issues such as the country's national debt or gun control.
U.S. IS ""GREAT POWER""
""It's much simpler to distract people with so-called Russian hackers, spies, and agents of influence. Does anyone really think that Russia could influence the American people's choice in any way? Is America a banana republic or what? America is a great power.""In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest dismissed Putin's remarks as predictable and said the United States stood by its hacking allegations. 
""There's nothing that President Putin had to say today that I find particularly surprising or that in any way undermines the president's confidence in the analysis that's been released by the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence community,"" said Earnest.Russian state TV and some of his past comments have suggested the Russian leader favours Trump, but Putin said he did not back any candidate in the U.S. election and was ready to work with any new U.S. president and to discuss any issue. Asked about Trump, whom he once described as ""very talented,"" Putin said the Republican candidate was deliberately adopting a showy style because he wanted to get his message across and that he represented ordinary voters fed up with the U.S. political elite.""He has chosen a method to get through to voters' hearts,"" said Putin. ""He behaves extravagantly of course, we see this, but I think there's a reason for this.""
Putin dismissed suggestions by some politicians in the West that Russia is poised to attack another country or intervene elsewhere in the Middle East apart from Syria.   Such talk was designed to exaggerate the threat that Russia posed, he said, in order for certain countries to secure higher military spending and talk up their own importance.He said Russia was not planning to attack anyone.But he made clear Russia was in Syria for the long haul and intended to clear the city of Aleppo of what he called ""a nest of terrorists"", while trying to minimise civilian casualties.
