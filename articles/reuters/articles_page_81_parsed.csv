By Chris Michaud
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Veteran actor and frequent host Alec Baldwin returned to ""Saturday Night Live"" on Saturday, debuting his new gig playing a scowling, blustering Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for U.S. president.The late night NBC comedy show, kicking off its 42nd season, opened with an extended sketch featuring Baldwin as Trump facing off with a calculating, cunning and smug Hillary Clinton, with Kate McKinnon reprising her turn as the Democratic nominee.Much of the routine was lifted from the opponents' Monday debate, including references to talk show host and Trump nemesis Rosie O'Donnell, and vocal Trump backer, Fox News' Sean Hannity.Baldwin began his Trump routine promising ""I'm going to be so good tonight,"" before issuing a perfunctory response on jobs and economics.""End of story, I won the debate, I stayed calm just like I promised, and it, is, over. Goodnight,"" he proclaimed before walking away.
Told by the moderator there were still 88 minutes left, ""Trump"" responded, ""My microphone is broken,"" adding ""She broke it. With Obama.""Asked what she thought of Trump's rambling discourse, a smirking McKinnon-as-Clinton replied ""I think I'm going to be president."" The audience for the live show applauded wildly.
After a few more minutes of Baldwin-as-Trump's increasingly bizarre remarks, a swaggering Clinton asks ""Can America vote right now?"" Later, fighting tears, she explained, ""This is going so well. It's going exactly how I always dreamed.""The show's writers made sure to take shots at the Democrat as well, including her referencing beauty queen Alicia Machado as ""a political prop that I almost forgot to mention"".In her closing statement, Clinton said ""Listen America, I get it, you hate me."" She then threatened that ""If you don't elect me, I will continue to run for president until the day I die.""
Baldwin, who has hosted Saturday Night Live more than anyone in its storied history, will be back as Trump until the November election, likely providing a ratings spike for the show that has mined U.S. elections and politics for comic fodder since 1975.Trump himself appeared on the show as host in November 2015, when he was campaigning to win the Republican nomination.

Hackers have probed the voting systems of many U.S. states but there is no sign that they have manipulated any voting data, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on Saturday.National security officials are investigating a number of possible leads suggesting that cyber-criminals are trying to influence the Nov. 8 presidential election, including by hacking into systems run by the Democratic National Committee.Republican candidate Donald Trump has repeatedly charged that the U.S. election system is ""rigged"" and top Democrats in Congress have charged that Russia is behind repeated attempts to access both party data and state voting systems.
""In recent months, malicious cyber actors have been scanning a large number of state systems, which could be a preamble to attempted intrusions,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""In a few cases, we have determined that malicious actors gained access to state voting-related systems. However, we are not aware at this time of any manipulation of data.""The head of the Democratic National Committee, Donna Brazile, last month said the organization had been hacked by Russian state-sponsored agents who were trying to influence the election, when voters will choose between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Trump, a New York real estate developer.
Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned as DNC chair on the eve of July's Democratic National Convention after WikiLeaks published a trove of hacked DNC emails that showed party officials favoring eventual nominee Hillary Clinton over Senator Bernie Sanders during the party's nominating contests.

BERLIN Germany's economy ministry believes a Donald Trump presidency would severely damage the U.S. economy, according to an internal memorandum reported by Der Spiegel magazine on Saturday.The ministry expects ""shrinking gross domestic product, fewer jobs and higher unemployment,"" in the United States if the Republican candidate were to implement his campaign pledges, the magazine cited the memo as saying.Trump, a billionaire businessman seeking his first public office, has proposed tax cuts worth $4.4 trillion and wants to curb government regulation and take a tougher stance on negotiating trade deals.He says his economic plan would produce annual economic growth of 3.5 percent and create 25 million jobs over a decade. But some economists have questioned the assumptions underpinning the plan.
Trump's pledges are ""not feasible"", Spiegel cited the memorandum as saying. Moreover, the plans would violate international or U.S. law and could be ""no basis for a realistic economic policy."" A spokeswoman for the German Economy Ministry declined to comment on the Spiegel report.    
Last month, economic research firm Oxford Economics projected the U.S. economy could be $1 trillion smaller than otherwise expected in 2021 if Trump becomes president.

By Doina Chiacu
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump increased his attacks on a former beauty queen with a vague and unsubstantiated allegation about a sex tape in predawn Twitter posts on Friday, and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton denounced him as ""unhinged.""Trump's refusal to drop his invective against Alicia Machado, the Miss Universe from Venezuela whom he criticized for gaining weight after she won the crown in 1996, threatened to damage his already weak standing among women and Hispanics.With less than six weeks to go until the Nov. 8 election, Trump made reference - without giving evidence - to a sex tape involving Machado, who had publicly denounced him all week as a humiliating bully. His attacks provided critics with new fodder to question his temperament for the White House. ""Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?"" Trump said in his Twitter messages in the early hours of Friday. He did not elaborate on his allegations beyond saying that the Clinton campaign was unaware of the beauty queen's past and had been ""duped"" by her. At a campaign rally in Coral Springs, Florida, Clinton said the episode was evidence that ""a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have the nuclear codes.""""Who gets up at 3 a.m. in the morning to engage in a Twitter attack against a former Miss Universe? I mean he hurled as many insults as he could. Really, why does he do things like that? ""His latest Twitter meltdown is unhinged, even for him. It proves again he is temperamentally unfit to be President of the United States,"" she said.Later on Friday, BuzzFeed said Trump made an appearance in a Playboy softcore pornographic movie from 2000 that it said it had obtained from an online adult video store in New York state.""Trump's role in the porn is relatively benign and centers around him breaking a bottle of champagne on a Playboy-branded limo while several of the playmates are visiting New York City,"" the online media outlet said.""There's been a lot of talk about sex tapes today and in a strange turn of events only one adult film has emerged today and its star is Donald Trump,"" Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told reporters after a campaign event in Florida.
Reuters could not confirm the BuzzFeed report. The Trump campaign did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.Merrill earlier said Clinton called Machado on Friday to thank her for what he said was the courage she has shown.Politico reported that Machado has starred in racy reality TV programs and posed naked for Playboy's Mexican version, but said media outlets have found no evidence that she has starred in pornographic films.Machado, now a U.S. citizen, dismissed the fresh attacks with a message on Instagram, calling them ""cheap lies"" from a man intent on defaming her.""By way of his hate campaign, the Republican candidate insists on discrediting and demoralizing a woman, which is clearly one of his most frightening characteristics,"" she wrote in her post in Spanish, next to a photo of herself draped in an American flag.
AUDIO ISSUE
Clinton raised Trump's treatment of Machado during their  first presidential debate on Monday as an example of how he views women. Clinton said Trump, the former owner of the Miss Universe pageants, had called Machado ""Miss Piggy"" and also ""Miss Housekeeping"" because she was a Latina.Trump attacked Machado the following day in a television interview as he sought to rebound from a debate that Clinton was widely viewed as having won. He also promised to hit Clinton harder in their next debate, on Oct. 9, suggesting he might attack Clinton on the infidelities of her husband, former President Bill Clinton.Speaking to Fox News on Tuesday, Trump said Machado had gained a ""massive amount of weight"" after her pageant win and that it was a ""real problem.""Critics said his offensive this week raised questions about Trump's character. The 70-year-old former reality TV star has never run for office before and his habit of making off-the-cuff insults has alarmed many in the Republican Party establishment.
In taking the bait Clinton dangled on Monday, Trump echoed his August entanglement in a days-long public dispute with the parents of a Muslim Army captain killed in Iraq. That incident caused anguish among many Republican leaders concerned that he had nothing to gain by attacking a grieving family.Trump's remarks on Friday could hurt him further with women and Hispanic voters. Clinton, 68, a former U.S. senator and secretary of state, is the first woman to win the presidential nomination of a major U.S. political party and has led Trump in opinion polls.The latest Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll, released on Friday, showed Clinton leading by 43 percent to Trump's 38 percent among likely voters.Clinton mocked Trump this week after he complained that he had a faulty microphone during Monday's debate.The Commission on Presidential Debates said on Friday that, ""Regarding the first debate, there were issues regarding Donald Trump's audio that affected the sound level in the debate hall."" The sound was not affected for the record-setting audience of 84 million people who tuned into the 90-minute exchange. At a rally in Novi, Michigan, Trump wondered aloud whether the microphone problem was deliberate.""It's difficult, and when you have a situation like that and you know it's bad and you think that 100 million people are watching, what do you do, stop the show? I wonder why it was bad,"" he said.

By Nick Brown
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Puerto Rico's newly created federal oversight board set an Oct. 14 deadline for the island's governor to draft a fiscal turnaround plan on Friday, as its first public meeting was disrupted by angry protesters.The board asked Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla to present a plan laying out his vision for stabilizing Puerto Rico, which is grappling with $70 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and a decade-long recession. The seven-member board, created under the Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA, was appointed on Aug. 31 by President Barack Obama and legislators. It will have broad powers to manage Puerto Rico's finances and facilitate debt restructuring talks with creditors.The board met for the first time on Friday in Manhattan, electing Jose Carrion III as chairman. Carrion, one of four native Puerto Ricans on the panel, is an insurance executive and past chairman of Puerto Rico's Workers Compensation Board.""We're working as quickly as possible, and we're establishing the procedures as transparently as possible,"" Carrion told reporters after the meeting, which lasted less than 30 minutes.
It is unclear what impact Garcia Padilla's fiscal turnaround plan will have. The unpopular governor is not seeking a second term in the Nov. 8 election, and the front-runner for his seat, a member of an opposition party, has different views on how to right Puerto Rico's ship, including by shrinking government and avoiding the debt defaults Garcia Padilla has initiated over the last year. Garcia Padilla, in a statement late on Friday, called Carrion's leadership of the board a positive step.
""In this process, we will try to make the Board understand that, for the recovery to be real, it must deal with the fiscal aspects, while protecting the economic ones,"" Garcia Padilla said.Protesters inside the auditorium interrupted the meeting, shouting profanities and likening the board to a form of ""slavery."" ""Shame on all of you,"" yelled one protester before being thrown out. ""Stop pillaging Puerto Rico."" 
The board on Friday also voted to include most major Puerto Rican entities as ""covered entities"" under its oversight, including Puerto Rico itself, its public pension systems, its highway, water and electric authorities and sales tax authority COFINA. The board voted to request financial information from Garcia Padilla including weekly cash flow reports, monthly reports on revenues and tax collection efforts and monthly payroll reports.

NEW YORK Donald Trump said he believed his assertion last year that Mexicans crossing the border illegally are ""rapists"" bringing crime were ""pretty mainstream"" and should have attracted customers to his new Washington restaurant, according to court records BuzzFeed News published on Friday.""I've tapped into something and I've tapped into illegal immigration,"" the Republican presidential candidate said in a June 16 deposition for a lawsuit against a celebrity chef who dropped out of the restaurant venture at his new hotel.Chef Geoffrey Zakarian pulled out after Trump's June 15, 2015 comments as he announced his bid for the White House.Trump said Zakarian may have missed an opportunity.""If he had the restaurant, it would be helped instead of hurt"" by the comments, Trump said in the deposition.
Zakarian, who has appeared in cooking shows like ""The Next Iron Chef,"" ""Chopped"" and ""Top Chef,"" signed a deal with Trump to open the restaurant in the historic Old Post Office building near the White House, which Trump won the right to lease and renovate from the U.S. government. The project, called the Trump International Hotel, opened on Sept. 12, almost a year after it was originally expected to begin operating.Zakarian backed out in July 2015, after the speech Trump gave on June 16, 2015 announcing his candidacy and bemoaning the flow of people across the southern U.S. border. Zakarian said Trump's comments were out of sync with his ""personal core values.""
Several companies, including Macy's Inc, broadcaster NBC and stock car racing organization NASCAR, also cut ties with Trump after his comments.Trump, through his subsidiary operating the hotel, sued Zakarian, alleging the broken deal cost him more than $10 million. 
In the deposition, Trump also said his comments about Mexicans illegally crossing the border had helped him win the Republican presidential nomination, a sign his views were ""pretty mainstream.""The case is Trump Old Post Office LLC et al v.

By Trevor Hunnicutt
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK An exchange-traded fund focused on Mexico has become a weather vane for Republican Donald Trump's chances winning the U.S. presidential election in November, investors said.Mexico has been a prime target for Trump, who has accused the country of taking away jobs from Americans, focusing particular ire on a landmark 1990s trade agreement with the United States' southern neighbor and Canada. He has said he will renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, commonly known as NAFTA, or pull out of it, and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to curb illegal immigration.Although a range of factors influence all markets, investors said this week that the U.S.-listed iShares MSCI Mexico Capped ETF (EWW) is increasingly being driven by the prospect of the New York businessman's election.It has been a good year for equity investors in emerging markets in general after three years of negative returns. But the $1 billion ETF has underperformed and is now in negative territory for the year as the peso has fallen and Trump's chances of winning the Nov. 8 election have gone up - though predictive models such as FiveThirtyEight and betting markets still forecast a Clinton victory.Short interest in the ETF - essentially bets that it will fall in price - have risen 59 percent since last month as Trump gained steam, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners LLC.Trump's worst relative showing in the past few months was Aug. 9, when a closely watched opinion polling average showed him nearly 8 percentage points behind Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Her lead has tightened to about 3 points, according to the RealClearPolitics average, although it is off lows of less than 1 point earlier this month. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday gave Clinton a 5-point lead over Trump, with 43 percent of likely voters.""Shorting the EWW ETF may be a vehicle to bet on Mr. Trump's success in being elected the next president of the U.S. and his willingness to address the long-standing Mexican trade imbalance,"" Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3 Partners' head of research, said in an email interview. ""In other words, as Trump's popularity rises, the chances of a negative impact on the Mexican economy rises.""
But it is not just shorts. The fund's price has also tended to suffer when polling averages and betting markets forecast Trump doing better. By contrast, the fund has tended to rise with Clinton's prospects, according to a Reuters analysis of market data, the polling averages and PredictIt prediction market data over the last quarter.The ETF saw a mild rebound this week after Clinton was seen by most as besting Trump in their first presidential debate on Monday.Much of the negative performance has been driven by the decline of the peso since last month, which hurt returns for U.S. dollar investors even when Mexican stocks hold their value.
""There's no reason for the peso to go from 18.20 to 19.50 (per dollar) unless it's because Trump has gone from being behind to being dead even with Hillary,"" David Garff, president of Accuvest Global Advisors, which sold its last share of the fund in May, said in a phone interview.Mexico's central bank chief Agustin Carstens said on Friday that ""it was a reality"" that there was a correlation between his country's weakening currency and the Trump campaign. ""I can't deny there's a knee-jerk reaction by the peso when it was perceived (Trump) did badly in the debate,"" said Win Thin, global head of emerging market currency strategy at financial services firm Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, ""but the peso's been weakening for several years even before Trump became the nominee.""""The media has been playing this up a bit, but Mexico's already suffering from low oil prices, sluggish growth,"" he said. ""The peso is often used as a proxy for the wider emerging markets, so there's all these other factors that to me are more important to determining the peso exchange rather than Trump.""
Even if the peso's decline has already come to an end, Accuvest's Garff said Mexican stocks held by the ETF could still be in for pain under a Trump presidency.Four-fifths of Mexico's exports go to the United States, and Garff said Mexican manufacturers could suffer if the United States forces its NAFTA partners to renegotiate the treaty.Central bank chief Carstens, speaking on local radio, said a Trump victory would hit his country like a hurricane, adding that the scenario for Mexico was better with a Clinton win. ""If Trump does try to blow up NAFTA, it will hurt Mexico. No question,"" said Garff, the investor. ""It is a double whammy.""

By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democrat Hillary Clinton has a 5 percentage point lead over Republican Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential race, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Friday, roughly the same advantage she has held all month.The survey result showed little movement following Monday night's presidential debate, the first of three debates before the Nov. 8 election.The Sept. 23-29 national tracking poll showed that likely voters support Clinton over Trump by 43 percent to 38 percent, while another 19 percent said they would not pick either candidate.Clinton has mostly led Trump in the poll this year, and her level of support has been 4-5 percentage points higher than Trump's in each of the last four weeks.
In a separate poll that included alternative party candidates, Clinton led the field by 4 percentage points. Among likely voters, 42 percent supported Clinton, 38 percent supported Trump, 7 percent supported Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and 3 percent supported Jill Stein of the Green Party.Monday's debate was the most watched presidential debate in U.S. history, with an estimated 84 million people tuning in for the 90-minute exchange. Some 56 percent of Americans adults who watched the debate said Clinton won, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday.
Voters appeared to be warming up to both candidates in Friday's poll. Some 48 percent of likely voters said they had an overall favorable view of Clinton, compared with 45 percent in the previous week, while 46 percent said they had a favorable view of Trump, up from 44 percent the week before.The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English in all 50 states. The poll included 2,501 people who were considered likely voters due to their registration status, voting history and stated intention to vote in the election. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points.
National opinion polls have differed this year in how they measure support for Clinton and Trump. Some polls, like Reuters/Ipsos, try to include only likely voters, while others include all registered voters. The Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll also gathers responses every day and reports results twice a week, so it often detects trends in sentiment before most other polls.An average of major opinion polls aggregated by RealClearPolitics showed Clinton ahead of Trump by 2.9 percentage points on Friday, or 47.3 points to 44.4, slightly lower than the previous margin of 3 points on Wednesday, but well up from 0.9 point on Sept. 19.

By Patricia Zengerle and Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. lawmakers expressed doubts on Thursday about Sept. 11 legislation they forced on President Barack Obama, saying the new law allowing lawsuits against Saudi Arabia could be narrowed to ease concerns about its effect on Americans abroad.A day after a rare overwhelming rejection of a presidential veto, the first during Obama's eight years in the White House, the Republican leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives opened the door to fixing the law as they blamed the Democratic president for not consulting them adequately.""I do think it is worth further discussing,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters, acknowledging that there could be ""potential consequences"" of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, known as JASTA. House Speaker Paul Ryan said Congress might have to ""fix"" the legislation to protect U.S. troops in particular.Ryan did not give a time frame, but Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he thought JASTA could be addressed in Congress' ""lame-duck"" session after the Nov. 8 election.The law grants an exception to the legal principle of sovereign immunity in cases of terrorism on U.S. soil, clearing the way for lawsuits seeking damages from the Saudi government. Riyadh denies longstanding suspicions that it backed the hijackers who attacked the United States in 2001.Sept. 11 families lobbied intensely for the bill, getting it passed by the House days before the 15th anniversary of the 2001 attacks earlier this month after years of effort.""We have to understand the political environment we're in right now and the tremendous support the 9/11 victims have in the United States,"" said Robert Jordan, a former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia.
Riyadh is one of Washington's longest-standing and most important allies in the Middle East and part of a U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.SAUDI CONDEMNATION
The Saudis lobbied furiously against JASTA, and the Saudi foreign ministry condemned its passage in a statement on Thursday. ""The erosion of sovereign immunity will have a negative impact on all nations, including the United States,"" said the statement, which was carried on state news agency SPA.Still, the new law is not expected to have a lasting effect on the two countries' strategic relationship.
Saudi-U.S. ties have endured ""multiple times of deep outrage"" over 70 years, said Thomas Lippman of the Middle East Institute. ""The two countries need each other as much today as they did before the day before yesterday,"" he said.White House spokesman Josh Earnest mocked lawmakers for shifting ""within minutes"" from overwhelmingly voting to override Obama's veto to wanting to change the law.""I think what we've seen in the United States Congress is a pretty classic case of rapid onset buyer's remorse,"" Earnest told a White House briefing.Corker said he had tried to work out a compromise with the White House, but Obama administration officials declined a meeting.
Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer, who championed JASTA in the Senate, said he was open to revisiting the legislation. ""I'm willing to look at any proposal they make but not any that hurt the families,"" he said at a news conference. He said he would oppose a suggestion that the measure be narrowed to only apply to the 2001 attacks on Washington and New York. ""You know what that does? It tells the Saudis to go ahead and do it again, and we won't punish you,"" Schumer said.Corker said another suggestion was establishing an international tribunal so experts could determine whether there was culpability. He said the Saudis were been willing to work on a compromise, and denied they had threatened retaliation.Trent Lott, a former Republican Senate Majority Leader now at a Washington law firm lobbying for the Saudis, said attorneys would look carefully at JASTA's language.""I do feel passionately this is a mistake for a variety of reasons, in terms of threats to troops, diplomats, sovereignty, there's serious problems here. Hopefully we can find a way to change the tenor of this,"" Lott said.

RIYADH Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry condemned the passage of a U.S. law that would allow families of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001  attacks to sue the kingdom for damages, calling it a matter of ""great concern"" in a statement on Thursday.The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to approve legislation that will allow the families of those killed in the 2001 attacks on the United States to seek damages from the Saudi government.""The erosion of sovereign immunity will have a negative impact on all nations, including the United States,"" said the Saudi statement, which was carried on state news agency SPA after a day of stony silence from Riyadh.The foreign ministry expressed hope that the U.S. Congress would correct the legislation ""to avoid the serious unintended consequences that may ensue,"" without elaborating on what the consequences might be.Riyadh has always dismissed suspicions that it backed the attackers, who killed nearly 3,000 people under the banner of Islamist militant group al-Qaeda. Fifteen out of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals.The Saudi government financed an extensive lobbying campaign against the ""Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act"", or JASTA, in the run-up to the vote, and warned it would undermine the principle of sovereign immunity.
But Saudi officials who had lobbied against the bill stopped short of threatening any specific retaliation if the law was passed.The Saudi riyal fell against the U.S. dollar in the forward foreign exchange market on Thursday after the law was passed.
Analysts said a successful lawsuit against the Saudi government would be unlikely at best, but speculated that the uncertainty surrounding the legal implications could negatively affect bilateral trade and investment with a major ally.Saudi Arabia's Gulf state neighbor, United Arab Emirates, warned of the long-term grave repercussions of Congress overriding Obama's veto.In a tweet late on Thursday, Anwar Gargash, the UAE's minister of state for foreign  affairs, called the U.S. Congress move ""a dangerous precedent in international law that undermines the principle of sovereign immunity and the future of sovereign investments in the United States"". 
In a later tweet Gargash said his country's reactions on both the legal and investment fronts should not be hasty and that ""easing the damage requires joint action"".  (Reporting by Katie Paul; Editing by Gareth Jones)"	[]	[]
