BOSTON/WASHINGTON U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry criticized presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Friday, warning that isolationist policies would take a toll on the country's well-being.""You are the most diverse class in Northeastern history. In other words, you are Donald Trump's worst nightmare,"" he jokingly told the 2016 graduates of Northeastern University in Boston.While he did not mention the billionaire businessman's name again, Kerry alluded to one of Trump's signature proposals - his call to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.""We will never come out on top if we accept advice from soundbite salesmen and carnival barkers who pretend the most powerful country on Earth can remain great by looking inward and hiding behind walls at a time when technology has made that impossible to do and unwise to even attempt,"" said the former U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, who was the Democratic nominee for president in 2004.
Kerry has generally declined to comment on the race leading up to the Nov. 8 presidential election, though he has noted that foreign leaders have raised concerns about statements made by candidates, particularly Trump.
A spokesman told reporters on Friday that Kerry's remarks in Boston were intended to be lighthearted.""He is not living in a bubble. He is obviously concerned about some of the tone and the effect that is having on foreign leaders,"" department spokesman John Kirby told a press briefing. ""If you're asking me because he enjoyed a light-hearted moment with students today has he changed his calculus to more aggressively jumping into active debates ... the answer is no.""

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama urged the U.S. media and American public on Friday to examine the ""long record"" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and not get distracted by the ""spectacle and the circus"" aspect of the 2016 election campaign.The Democratic president delivered an indirect swipe at the flamboyant, combative Republican primary campaign run by Trump, a former reality television star, and how media have covered it.""It's important for us to take seriously the statements he's made in the past,"" Obama said in remarks to reporters. ""I just want to emphasize the degree to which we are in serious times and this is a really serious job.""This is not entertainment. This is not a reality show. This is a contest for the presidency of the United States.""He said Trump has a long record in public life and that should be closely examined, as should the statements and policy positions of all the candidates.
""If they take a position on international issues that could threaten war or has the potential of upending our critical relationships with other countries, or would potential break the financial system - that needs to be reported on,"" Obama said.Trump received criticism and angered allies with his comments on rethinking NATO and suggesting Japan and South Korea should consider getting nuclear weapons to defend themselves. He is perceived abroad as pursuing isolationist policies at odds with the current U.S. role in the world.
Obama said he would be looking to see the American people are adequately informed about where candidates to replace him in the White House stand on issues, what they believe and whether their budget numbers add up.""What I'm concerned about is the degree to which reporting and information starts emphasizing the spectacle and the circus. Because that's not something we can afford,"" Obama said.

By David Brunnstrom
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Japan's ambassador to the United States weighed in on the U.S. presidential election debate on Friday by arguing against the ""America first"" stance of Republican candidate Donald Trump and stressing the importance of the U.S.-Japan alliance.Without mentioning Trump by name, the envoy, Kenichiro Sasae, told a Washington forum Japan had come up unexpectedly in the election debate, showing that nothing could be taken for granted in terms of the long-standing alliance.""In the presidential elections, there are arguments whether the United States is going for the isolationist stance,"" Sasae said. ""I don't want to see that kind of United States.""I want to see the United States to be strong and come with a strong robust position, not really thinking of the United States only,"" he said.Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, has portrayed Japan, a long-time treaty ally of the United States, as a free-rider on security. He has suggested Tokyo might need nuclear weapons to ease U.S. financial commitment to its defense, anathema to the only country ever attacked by atomic bombs.
Japan's Minister for Regional Revitalization, Shigeru Ishiba, said comments by one candidate, who he said he would not name, were causing ""a lot of concern in Japan.""Ishiba told the forum that if Japan or South Korea chose to develop nuclear weapons regional stability would suffer, and added: ""I don't think it will add to the U.S. interest.""
""No matter who becomes the president, understanding the essence of the alliance, accurately grasping the international environment we have been placed in would lead, I am sure, to proper policies being implemented,"" he added.Sasae said he understood there was a debate about how to make America strong, but added ""the question is whether you could be strong without a proper role around the world."" ""It is important not to undermine ... one, the value of the U.S.-Japan alliance; two, the geopolitical implications of emerging or resurgent powers in the world; three, the capability  and strength of the United States.""
Trump outlined a clear ""America First"" policy in a speech late last month, vowing that if he were elected president, U.S. allies in Europe and Asia would have to fend for themselves if they did not pay more for the U.S. defense umbrella.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Thursday Japan's U.S. alliance was the foundation of Asian peace and prosperity and Tokyo hoped to be able to work with whoever becomes U.S. president.

By Ginger Gibson and Emily Stephenson

Republican lawmakers, operatives and donors grappled with whether to support Donald Trump, who effectively clinched his party's presidential nomination this week after his two remaining rivals, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, dropped out of the White House race.As Trump sought to rally the fractured party behind him, many prominent Republicans got behind the reality TV star and real estate developer, while some weighed their options. Still others said they might vote in the Nov. 8 general election for Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee. Bill Achtmeyer, the Boston-based founder of consulting firm Parthenon Group, was among those considering a possible vote for Clinton, a former secretary of state and former first lady.  ""If she is able to move to the center and think as creatively and thoughtfully as her husband (Bill Clinton) did ... boy, I would have a very hard time, based on what I know today, not voting for Hillary versus what Trump is espousing,"" said Achtmeyer, who has donated $200,000 to Republicans over the last decade.Another Republican donor, David Beightol, a Washington lobbyist who raised money this year for the presidential bid of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, said he was leaning toward voting for Trump because he could not support Clinton.""I'm not there yet, but I don't have a lot of choice,"" Beightol said. In most U.S. elections cycles, party insiders quickly coalesce around candidates once they have effectively sewn up the nomination. But Trump's bombastic rhetoric, unorthodox campaign and his lack of experience in government have left the party divided.
The New York billionaire has vowed to deport illegal immigrants and build a wall along the Mexican border. He has also said he would temporarily bar Muslims from entering the country as a way to combat terrorism.Republican former presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush do not plan to endorse anyone in the White House race this year, their spokesmen told Reuters. The party's presidential nominee in 2012, Mitt Romney, will not attend the Republican National Convention in July, an aide said. The former Massachusetts governor delivered a blistering attack on Trump in March.The party's 2008 nominee, U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona, has said he would support the eventual nominee, ""who is now presumptively Donald Trump,"" said McCain's Senate campaign spokeswoman, Lorna Romero. 
But McCain told supporters in Arizona last month that having Trump at the top of the Republican ticket make his re-election harder, according a recording obtained by Politico. The state has a large Hispanic population.On Wednesday, fresh off the win in Indiana's primary that drove both his rivals out of the race, Trump pledged to unify the party and said he was getting calls from people who had criticized him in the past but who now wanted to back him.Supporters of Trump, who has never held elective office,  said he could ease concerns about his lack of experience by choosing a well-known running mate. Representatives Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee and Chris Collins of New York both suggested former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Rice did not respond to a request for comment.Trump told CNBC on Thursday there was a 40 percent chance his vice presidential pick would be a former Republican presidential rival.
Backers said Trump could mend ties with allies of Cruz, who had been his strongest challenger and had trumpeted himself as a true conservative, by meeting with lawmakers in person after a heated campaign in which Trump dubbed the U.S. senator from Texas ""Lyin' Ted.""Cruz's supporters on Capitol Hill have ties to conservative activists and the Tea Party, groups that could help Trump raise money and turn out voters. DesJarlais said meeting Trump in person would improve their impressions of him.Representative Raul Labrador, a Cruz backer and conservative leader from Idaho, told a radio station that he saw Trump as favoring the political ""establishment"" even though he has run as an outsider. But he said Trump would likely appoint a conservative to the U.S. Supreme Court, a priority for many on the political right.""With Clinton, there is no chance,"" Labrador said. ""In my opinion, there's just no choice between the two.""

WASHINGTON/LONDON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Thursday he thought Britain would be better off out of the European Union, the opposite stance to that taken by his likely rival Hillary Clinton and by many political leaders around the world.Britons will vote in a referendum on June 23 on whether to leave the 28-member EU, a momentous decision with trade, investment, defense and political ramifications that stretch far beyond Britain's borders.""I would say that they're better off without it personally, but I'm not making that as a recommendation - just my feeling,"" Trump said in an interview with Fox News television, adding that he wanted Britons to make their own decision.""I think the migration has been a horrible thing for Europe. A lot of that was pushed by the EU,"" he said, without providing any specifics.Initial reaction to Trump's comments, which went further than what he had previously said on the subject, was muted in Britain where the focus was on the incoming results of local and regional elections.Given Trump's controversial statements and his negative image in the eyes of many Europeans, including Britons, it is not clear whether his endorsement would be good, bad or indifferent for Britain's ""Leave"" campaign.
A spokesman for the campaign declined to comment.U.S. President Barack Obama made a passionate intervention in the EU debate during a visit to London last month, saying EU membership magnified Britain's role in the world and made it more prosperous.Obama warned Britons their country would find itself ""in the back of the queue"" for a trade deal with the United States if they voted to leave the EU.
The ""Remain"" camp, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, has repeatedly said that none of Britain's significant allies wants it to leave the bloc.On Thursday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe became the latest foreign leader to say it would be better for Britain and its allies if it remained in the European club.After Obama's intervention, the ""Remain"" campaign published an advertisement with side-by-side photos of Obama smiling and Trump with a distorted facial expression and a finger in the air. 
The slogan read: ""Obama thinks the UK is stronger in Europe. Trump thinks the UK should leave Europe. Whose side are you on?""The image suggested that the official ""Remain"" campaign viewed Trump as repellent to British voters. A spokesman for the campaign had no immediate comment on Friday.

By Emily Stephenson and Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The top elected Republican, Paul Ryan, said on Thursday he was not ready to endorse Donald Trump, a sign of the challenges the party's presumptive presidential nominee faces rallying the Republican establishment behind his White House bid.Ryan, the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, said conservatives wanted to know if Trump shares their values.""I hope to support our nominee, I hope to support his candidacy fully,"" Ryan said on CNN. ""At this point, I'm just not there right now.""Trump, who has built a huge following with an anti-establishment message, shot back at Ryan in a statement.""I am not ready to support Speaker Ryan's agenda. Perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the American people,"" he said.The Republican National Committee, under pressure to unify the party or face an electoral rout in the Nov. 8 election, said  Ryan and Trump were expected to meet soon. It added that ""only a united Republican Party will be able to beat Hillary Clinton.""""We respect Speaker Ryan's opinion and believe that since the primary ended early we will have time to unify. We anticipate the two meeting soon to begin to help unite the party,"" said RNC spokeswoman Lindsay Walters.Trump's last remaining rivals in the Republican race, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich, dropped out this week, clearing the New York billionaire's path to be picked as the presidential nominee. He will likely face Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, in the Nov. 8 general election.Many Republicans have grappled this week with whether to support Trump, who has deviated from the party line on trade and upset the party establishment with offensive comments about women and immigrants. Trump on Thursday announced a new campaign finance chairman in response to questions about his readiness for a general election race.TAKING ON CLINTON

Trump, speaking to thousands at a rally in Charleston, West Virginia, on Thursday night, sharpened his criticism of Clinton, the kind of tactic that some Republican strategists believe will help unify the party.He blasted Clinton for saying recently she would impose clean-energy policies that would put coal miners out of business. He put on a hard hat presented to him by the state's coal miners' association and made a shoveling motion.""And for those miners, get ready: You're going to be working your asses off,"" he said.In a sign some Republicans are rallying around Trump, Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, whose family has helped bankroll the anti-Trump group Our Principles, is set to endorse Trump on Friday when the candidate visits Omaha.Former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who ran unsuccessfully for the 2016 nomination, told CNN he now supported Trump as well.Ryan criticized Trump in December for proposing to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the United States and knocked him in March for failing to denounce white supremacist groups during a television interview.
The House speaker, who was the running mate of Republican 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, a harsh Trump critic, said he hoped the party would be unified by this summer but that the pressure was on Trump to do that.""He won fair and square,"" Ryan said of Trump, acknowledging his own policy differences with the New York billionaire businessman. He added: ""If we don't unify all wings of the party, we're not going to win this election.""Ryan repeatedly denied interest in running for president this year despite attempts to draft him by some in his party. He has been putting together a policy plan for House Republicans to campaign on, which he says will be released before the convention in July.CAMPAIGN FUNDRAISING

Trump on Thursday began shifting focus from the bruising primary campaign to the general election. He has largely used his own money for his primary fight but plans to follow the more typical path of raising money from outside sources for the general election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama.He named his campaign finance chief on Thursday - Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner who is chief executive of private investment firm Dune Capital Management and with whom Trump worked in a business capacity in the past.Mnuchin has a long history of political donations, including to Clinton. Since 1998, Mnuchin has given about $71,000 to Democrats, compared with about $37,000 to Republicans. Republicans have questioned Trump's loyalty to the party because he also donated to Democratic candidates in the past.U.S. Representative Renee Ellmers, a Republican from North Carolina who has endorsed Trump, told Reuters the campaign would begin raising money for the party.""They are going to start understanding and realizing that in order to grow this operation, they will need to grow funds, not only for him and for the campaign to beat Hillary Clinton, but  for the Republican Party itself,"" Ellmers said. Historically, political parties have depended on their nominees to raise money in order to fund their other operations, including working to elect members of the House of Representatives and Senate.One key worry for Republicans has been that their candidates for Congress and other elective positions could suffer with the divisive figure of Trump at the top of the ticket. Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist, said Ryan gave lawmakers in his party cover to steer clear of Trump in their re-election campaigns.""He is positioning the Republican conference and giving Republicans a message they can hold onto,"" Bonjean said.
