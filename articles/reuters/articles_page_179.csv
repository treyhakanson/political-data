By Yasmeen Abutaleb

As the U.S. presidential campaign heats up, Facebook Inc is going out of its way to show its neutrality - an increasingly urgent matter for the social network as evidence of its power  continues to emerge.Recent studies have shown the site has extraordinary influence. According to research scheduled to be published in August in the Journal of Communication, when people tagged their friends on Facebook in voting reminders, turnout increased by 15 to 24 percent. During U.S. presidential primary elections this year, a Facebook reminder that informed people when their state's voter registration deadline was approaching and provided a link helped produce a surge of nearly 650,000 new voter registrations in California alone, according to Secretary of State Alex Padilla.In the United Kingdom, a Facebook reminder days before the deadline to register to vote on whether the country should exit the European Union led to 186,000 people registering online to vote, according to the government. ""Generally, getting people out to vote could swing a national election,"" said Katherine Haenschen, a PhD student at the University of Texas, Austin and author of the upcoming Journal of Communications study.Facebook is eager to show that its political involvement is limited to seemingly neutral activities such as encouraging voting. The company this week released some of the guidelines that govern its all-important News Feed - the place most people see postings on Facebook - and has pushed back hard against recent allegations of political bias in its ""Trending Topics"" module.
At the same time Facebook has embraced its role as a ""new town hall"" for politics, hosting events and helping candidates more effectively leverage their platforms, said Katie Harbath, Facebook's global politics and government outreach directorHer team helps candidates by answering their questions and providing advice, such as how to use Facebook Live and how to increase engagement on their pages.  ECHO CHAMBER
Still, concerns about Facebook's role in shaping political attitudes are unlikely to abate anytime soon.
Some people object even to voter-registration drives. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, for example, alleged this week that Google and Facebook were trying to encourage a ""remain"" vote in Britain's referendum on European Union membership by encouraging voting, asserting that media users are disproportionately youthful and pro-Europe.   A more common complaint is that Facebook and other social networks serve as an echo chamber of ideas and beliefs, as users decide which people and pages they will follow and customize their News Feed.  A 2015 study in Science showed that Facebook users tended to interact and click on content that was more in line with their ideological views. 
Facebook customer Tom Steinberg wrote in a post this week -one that quickly spread over Twitter - that he had actively looked on Facebook for people celebrating Britain's vote to exit the European Union last week but could not find any. Steinberg, who said he was in favor of remaining in the European Union, urged tech leaders to do more to address the echo chamber on social media. ""To not act on this problem now is tantamount to actively supporting and funding the tearing apart of the fabric of our societies,"" Steinberg wrote. ""We're getting countries where one half just doesn't know anything at all about the other."" Adam Mosseri, vice president of product management for News Feed, said the team tries to help users find new pages to follow, though he did not cite any specific efforts aimed at encouraging people to diversify their feeds.

WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate is aiming to finish its work and vote later on Wednesday on final passage of a relief plan to help Puerto Rico address its $70 billion debt, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said.The bill cleared a critical procedural hurdle in the Senate on Wednesday morning, and has already passed the House of Representatives. Supporters want to send it to President Barack Obama to sign into law by Friday, when Puerto Rico faces a potential default on a chunk of its debt if it cannot make a $1.9 billion payment.

By Toni Clarke
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden on Wednesday announced plans as part of the administration's ""Cancer Moonshot"" initiative, aimed at speeding development of treatments by cutting bureaucracy and easing collaboration between scientists, industry, patients and government.Speaking at a cancer summit at Howard University in Washington, Biden made an impassioned plea for increased urgency in the fight against cancer. The event was part of a national day of action involving hundreds of researchers, patient advocates and data experts across the country.Biden's son Beau died last year at age 46 from brain cancer, something Biden said helps inform his passion for the project. ""I believe we can do in the next five years what would normally take 10 years,"" he said. ""Time matters, days matter, minutes matter.""Among proposals intended to bypass inefficiency at the federal level, he announced the formation of an Oncology Center of Excellence at the Food and Drug Administration, which will coordinate and review all of FDA cancer treatments.
It comes as scientific advances in diagnostics allow for greater tailoring of drugs to an individual's genetic profile. It is the first of four potential centers proposed under a bill moving through Congress.Under the existing review system, companies submit products to different divisions of the agency depending on whether it is a drug, device or biologic, a drug made from living cells. A treatment that combines a drug and a diagnostic device could get reviewed on different timelines.
""We are moving into a very complicated area in oncology where drugs and devices and biologics are going to be used in combination or sequentially,"" Dr. Richard Pazdur, the FDA's cancer drug director, said in an interview.Pazdur will oversee the establishment of the center and act as its director for the next 120 days, with the potential for the position to be renewed. He will report directly to FDA Commissioner Robert Califf.The ""Cancer Moonshot"" initiative was announced by President Barack Obama at his State of the Union address in January.
Biden outlined a slew of other collaborations and initiatives, including making it easier for patients to find and enter clinical trials through the creation of a cancer trials website and making it easier for scientists to focus on research and less on raising money.""We have to change the culture that turns scientists into grant writers,"" he said. ""We have to reward teamwork."" (Reporting by Toni Clarke in Washington and Bill Berkrot in New York; Editing by Bernard Orr and Jonathan Oatis)"

WASHINGTON The Commodity Futures Trading Commission would have stronger policing powers over the derivatives market, along with a boosted budget, under legislation introduced in the U.S. Congress on Wednesday.The bill, introduced by Democrats Elizabeth Warren and Mark Warner in the Senate and Elijah Cummings in the House of Representatives, also would add new tasks to the regulator's rulemaking agenda.""The only way to make sure that derivatives can never lead to a financial crisis and taxpayer bailouts again is to put in place clearer rules and stronger oversight,"" Warren said in a statement. The bill likely will fizzle in the Republican-led Congress. It could also become part of this year's election fights, as the relationship between Wall Street and Washington frequently moves to center stage in presidential and congressional campaigns.  Democrats such as Warren, who is campaigning for her party's presumptive nominee, Hillary Clinton, regard the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law passed after the 2007-09 financial crisis as crucial for preventing another massive meltdown. That law greatly expanded the CFTC's reach, as swaps and derivatives had played a key role in the breakdown of banks and other firms.
They also seek further regulation, saying vulnerabilities persist in the financial system.The presumptive nominee for the Republican Party, real estate developer and television star Donald Trump wants to repeal Dodd-Frank. Many in the party say the law has gone too far, drying up liquidity and freezing capital.The proposed legislation ""gives the CFTC a stable funding stream and the tools necessary to help deter future illegal acts by permitting penalties large enough to impact the bottom lines of even the largest financial firms,"" Cummings said.
The CFTC currently is funded through annual appropriations from Congress, unlike the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is backed by user fees and fines. CFTC Chair Timothy Massad has sought a change, saying millions of dollars more in funds would help the agency keep up with technology advancements in the markets it oversees and with ""high-powered defense teams"" in its enforcement cases.
Republicans in Congress say the funding process keeps the agency accountable to elected leaders.The Democrats' bill would move the CFTC to the same model as the SEC. It would also put certain foreign exchange swaps under CFTC jurisdiction, change how derivatives are treated in bankruptcy, require posting initial margin in inter-affiliate swaps, and require regulators to review derivatives clearinghouses.

WASHINGTON U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, speaking as lawmakers prepared to vote on a bill to address Puerto Rico's financial crisis, warned on Wednesday that failure to pass the legislation by Friday could lead to a taxpayer funded bailout.""This is the best and possibly the only action we can take to help Puerto Rico,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor amid uncertainty over whether the legislation would receive the support needed in a critical procedural vote due at 10:30 a.m. EDT.
""Doing nothing now ... (is) the surest route to both a taxpayer funded bailout of Puerto Rico and a humanitarian crisis for its people,"" he said.

By Susan Cornwell and David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The Obama administration and U.S. Senate Republican leaders scrambled on Tuesday to garner enough support to get a Puerto Rico debt relief bill through a critical procedural vote set for Wednesday which several lawmakers predicted would be close.After months of waiting for Congress to act as Puerto Rico's economic crisis progressively worsened, the Caribbean island appeared to be on the verge of securing a relief plan from Washington aimed at helping it address a hobbling $70 billion debt.The leaders of both political parties in the Senate are on board, but the outcome appeared uncertain.The Obama administration sent Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to try to persuade recalcitrant Democrats, while Republicans heard arguments for the legislation from fellow senators at a closed-door luncheon.""We will win the vote tomorrow,"" said Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, as he left the meeting with Lew.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, told reporters he was ""very much on board,"" and was urging Republicans to back the measure establishing a federal oversight board to be in charge of restructuring the U.S. territory's debt.""I'm hopeful and optimistic that the (Obama) administration will be able to get Democrats on board, and we believe strongly that it's an approach that appeals to most Republicans,"" McConnell said.Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said he would support the bill. The Senate Democratic whip, Dick Durbin of Illinois, a recent convert to the proposal, said he was trying to get a majority of Democrats to back it. 
House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi added that while there is much to the legislation she objected to, she implored her Senate colleagues to adopt the bill. ""Failure to pass this bill would be a tremendous win for the unscrupulous hedge funds that have held this bill up for six months demanding to be first in line over the needs of the people of Puerto Rico,"" she said.""Unless Congress acts, our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico will be plunged into deep economic turmoil in just three days' time.""Puerto Rico's 3.5 million residents are U.S. citizens. The U.S. territory is reeling from a 45 percent poverty rate, a steady flow of outward migration to the U.S. mainland that further shrinks its tax base and the shuttering of essential services.But Durbin predicted ""it will be close"" Wednesday morning, when the Puerto Rico debt relief bill will need a supermajority of 60 senators' votes to stay alive in the Senate. And despite McConnell's expression of optimism, other Republicans said the leadership appeared worried behind the scenes.
""I think leadership is concerned because they're really whipping it,"" said Senator Dean Heller, a Nevada Republican. ""When they whipped me last night, I said 'no'. So they're coming back and asking if I'll reconsider.""JOINING THE FRAY
The White House joined the fray, with spokesman Josh Earnest saying that without action by Congress to help Puerto Rico deal with its debt, the need for a bailout of the U.S. territory will become more likely.
The measure is identical to the plan passed by the House of Representatives earlier this month, as Congress tries to send it to President Barack Obama to sign into law by July 1. That is when Puerto Rico faces a potential default on a chunk of its debt if it cannot make $1.9 billion in payments. If the Wednesday morning procedural vote is successful, it would clear the measure for passage this week. But Republican skeptics of the bill are worried it could constitute a bailout - something its supporters deny - while Democrats have expressed concern about the composition of the oversight board and labor provisions that they say could lower minimum wages for young workers in Puerto Rico.The top Democrat on the Senate Finance committee, Oregon's Ron Wyden, announced Tuesday he would back the legislation. But Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown appeared to be wavering even after meeting with Lew, Wyden and other Democrats in a Senate office building. Brown said he would be more likely to vote ""yes"" in Wednesday's procedural vote if Senate leaders promise him a vote on an unrelated issue - legislation to ensure that the federal government and coal mine operators honor payment of promised pensions and health benefits to retired miners.Lew said he thought there was  ""broad understanding"" of the urgency. ""I just do not believe that we can let three and a half million Americans descend into chaos,"" he said.

By Daniel Trotta
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Dominican-born Adriano Espaillat claimed victory on Tuesday in the U.S. congressional race to succeed longtime Representative Charles Rangel, signaling change in the historically black neighborhood of Harlem that has grown increasingly Hispanic.Nine Democrats ran in the primary to select the party's candidate for November's general election. In a district where Democratic voters heavily outnumber Republicans, Tuesday's winner will have a virtual lock on taking Rangel's vacated seat in the House of Representatives.Espaillat, once an illegal immigrant, would be the first Dominican-American member of Congress.A state senator, Espaillat, held a 3-point lead on state Assemblyman Keith Wright, an African-American who was endorsed by Rangel and benefited from the political machine of a man who held the job for 46 years.With 98 percent of polling places reporting, Espaillat had 36.7 percent of the vote compared with 33.7 percent for Wright, a difference of nearly 1,300 votes.""The voters of the 13th congressional district made history tonight,"" Espaillat, 61, said in a victory speech.
""The voters ... elected a country boy from Santiago de los Caballeros in the Dominican Republic,"" he said, mixing Spanish and English.Wright, however, refused to concede, telling supporters: ""No candidate can declare victory tonight, not until every vote is counted.""The district is dominated by Harlem, long a leading cultural center, home to black political and commercial life, and an incubator for jazz. 
Harlem notably has grown more white with gentrification, but it also has become more Hispanic. Besides Harlem, the district also includes predominantly Latino neighborhoods further to the north where Espaillat has his base.Rangel, 86, a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, won his first congressional election in 1970, and since then Harlem voters routinely returned him to office every two years, even after his 2010 censure for ethics violations. Espaillat tried and failed to unseat Rangel in 2012 and 2014 primary elections.
Gentrification emerged as a leading issue in the campaign, as a decade-long influx of affluent people, many of them white, has transformed Harlem's once-blighted blocks of 19th century brownstone town houses.Change has muted the distinctive black identity of the area, the home of the Apollo Theater, the Cotton Club and other monuments of African-American culture.Once an upscale Dutch neighborhood named after the city near Amsterdam, Harlem drew African-Americans during the northward migration of former slaves in the late 19th Century and again between the world wars. In decades past, affluent New Yorkers avoided venturing too far north, or ""uptown."" But soaring property values have turned Harlem into one of New York's trendiest real estate markets.

By David Shepardson and Joel Schectman
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON German automaker Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) will pay as much as $15.3 billion after admitting it cheated on U.S. diesel emissions tests for years, agreeing to buy back vehicles from consumers and provide funding that could benefit makers of cleaner technologies.The largest-ever automotive buyback offer in the United States came in a deal announced on Tuesday by the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, Environmental Protection Agency and California state regulators. The proposed consent decree confirmed that VW will set aside $10.033 billion to cover buybacks or fixes for diesel cars and sport utility vehicles that used illegal software to defeat government emissions tests.VW admitted in September that it installed secret software that allowed U.S. vehicles to emit up to 40 times legally allowable pollution. VW still may face criminal charges and oversight by an independent monitor, a person briefed on the matter said.A criminal settlement could include measures to ensure VW would not engage in further cheating.Shares of VW rose as much as 5 percent on Tuesday, and closed up 1.7 percent at 107.85 euros.""We didn't follow a multiyear, grind-it-out litigation strategy, which would have been counterproductive for Volkswagen,"" said Robert Giuffra Jr., VW's lead lawyer.  ""We moved with lightning speed to settle with our federal and state regulators and the private plaintiffs.""   Under the Justice Department deal, VW will provide $2 billion over 10 years to fund programs directed by California and EPA to promote construction of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, development of zero-emission ride-sharing fleets and other efforts to boost sales of cars that do not burn petroleum.VW also agreed to put up $2.7 billion over three years to enable government and tribal agencies to replace old buses or to fund infrastructure to reduce diesel emissions.The settlement covers 475,000 2.0-liter diesel Jetta, Beetle, Audi A3, Golf, and Passat vehicles from the 2009-2015 model years.
VW also announced a separate settlement with 44 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico that will cost at least $600 million, bringing the total to as much as $15.3 billion.Deputy U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates said a criminal investigation remained active. ""We're looking at multiple companies and multiple individuals,"" she said.""By duping regulators, Volkswagen turned nearly half a million American drivers into unwitting accomplices in an unprecedented assault on our environment,"" she added.The EPA is investigating other automakers for potential emissions problems. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said the agency ""will be releasing information as it becomes available.""VW still faces criminal investigations in Germany and other countries, and lawsuits from investors around the world.
The company planned a multi-billion-euro investment program to introduce more than 30 fully electric cars by 2025.FIX OR SELL
Owners have until late 2018 to decide whether to sell the vehicles back. 
The deals would move VW close to the 16.2 billion euros ($18 billion) it has set aside to cover costs of the scandal.But spending on buybacks could be much less if regulators approve fixes and owners opt for repairs. Most owners will get $5,100 to $10,000 in compensation, including the pre-scandal value of the cars, documents filed on Tuesday said.The company expects to begin buying back vehicles in October, when a U.S. judge is expected to give final approval to the settlements, and is to start proposing fixes in November. VW cannot resell or export vehicles it buys back unless the EPA approves a fix, the documents said. Volkswagen must repair or buy back 85 percent of the 475,000 vehicles by June 2019 or face penalties of $100 million for every percentage point below that figure.The agreement does not lift a ban on sales by VW of its U.S. 2016 diesel vehicles. Nor does it cover fees for lawyers of owners suing the company or address 80,000 larger polluting 3.0 liter Porsche, Audi and VW diesel cars. VW could also face billions in additional costs if it is forced to buy back the 3.0 liter vehicles. VW will likely face significant yet-to-be determined fines under the U.S. Clean Air Act for emissions violations.The settlement does not resolve lawsuits filed last year by owners against German auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH, which was accused of conspiring with Volkswagen to evade emissions standards.

PHOENIX U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on Tuesday that it was important for the Justice Department to look at individuals in the ongoing criminal investigation into the Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) emissions scandal.Asked whether she would like to see company executives held accountable for the company's wrongdoing, Lynch told Reuters: ""What's important for us in every case, including this case,  is to look at those individuals and see what if anything will be  resolved with regards to them.""

""Certainly it relates to every case, that when it comes to corporate wrongdoing whether it is civil or criminal, that the Department of Justice will be looking at everyone who was involved in making those decisions and in implementing the actions that led to the liability that we have found,"" she said in an interview in Phoenix.
