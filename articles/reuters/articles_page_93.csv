WASHINGTON U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump opposes a long-planned transition of oversight of the internet's technical management from the U.S. government to a global community of stakeholders, his campaign said in a statement on Wednesday.Congress should block the handover, scheduled to occur on Oct. 1, ""or internet freedom will be lost for good, since there will be no way to make it great again once it is lost,"" Stephen Miller, national policy director for the Trump campaign, said in a statement.Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a former presidential primary foe of Trump's who has refused to endorse the real estate developer, has led a movement in Congress to block the transition, arguing it could cede control of the internet itself to authoritarian regimes like Russia and China and threaten online freedom.
Technical experts have said those claims are baseless, and that a delay will backfire by undermining U.S. credibility in future international negotiations over internet standards and security.Publicly proposed in March 2014, the transfer of oversight of the nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, is expected to go forward unless Congress votes to block the move. 
A vote to delay the transition may come as an amendment to a temporary spending bill that Congress must pass by Sept. 30 to prevent much of the federal government from shutting down. Congressional negotiators on Wednesday were working to finalize an agreement on the spending package.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton supports the Obama administration's planned transition to a global community of technologists, civil society groups and internet users, according to policy positions available on her campaign website.

Kansas sought on Wednesday to avoid a court ruling that could force the cash-strapped state to increase school funding by more than $1 billion.Lawyers for the state and for public school districts faced off before the Kansas Supreme Court in the latest chapter of a decades-long battle over equitable and adequate funding.Stephen McAllister, the state's solicitor general, argued that while Kansas may be spending less on education than some other states, student achievement is improving.""Kansas is making excellent use of resources to do pretty well compared to the nation,"" he told the justices.The state spends about $4 billion on schools, but lawyers for the four districts suing the state claim another $430 million to $1.4 billion would be required to meet the state constitution's requirement for adequate funding. 
""We're falling short and we're leaving massive numbers of kids behind,"" said Alan Rupe, an attorney for the districts.He asked the court to declare the system unconstitutional and give the state legislature some direction on achieving constitutionality and a full legislative session to come up with a new system.
The justices did not indicate when they might rule.The adequacy question comes after the court ruled in June that Kansas had complied with its order to resolve inequities in educating students.
Kansas' budget is feeling the effects of actions taken by Republican Governor Sam Brownback and the legislature in recent years to cut corporate and other income taxes in hopes of helping the state compete with bordering Missouri and other states for business development and jobs.The state's fiscal woes led Standard & Poor's to downgrade Kansas' credit rating by one notch to AA-minus in July.

WASHINGTON The U.S. House of Representatives would override any presidential veto of a bill allowing survivors and families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia, Speaker Paul Ryan predicted on Wednesday while also citing concerns with the legislation.""I worry about legal matters. I worry about trial lawyers trying to get rich off of this. And I do worry about the precedence. At the same time, these victims do need to have their day in court,"" Ryan, a Republican, told reporters.Congress has overwhelmingly passed the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act in reaction to long-running suspicions, denied by Saudi Arabia, that hijackers of the four U.S. jetliners that attacked the United States in 2001  were backed by the Saudi government. Obama in coming days is expected to veto the bill on grounds that other countries could use the law as an excuse to sue U.S. diplomats, service members or companies. But Congress could have the last word if the Senate and House of Representatives each override that veto by a two-thirds vote.
""I do think the votes are there for the override,"" Ryan said.When asked by a reporter if U.S. support for Saudi Arabia was ""unconditional,"" Ryan responded that the country ""is a very important and valuable ally"" and is helping Washington in the ""war on terror.""
He noted, however, ""Our support for any country is not unconditional.""

By Michelle Conlin and Grant Smith
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been a hit with small donors, raking in two-thirds of his individual campaign contributions in sums of $200 or less, according to financial disclosures filed on Tuesday. But with the big-money donor class, the players Trump blasted during the primary season as greedy influence peddlers, the celebrity businessman has fallen short of expectations, the disclosures filed with the federal government showed.Trump took in 65 percent of his total $75 million in individual campaign contributions from people who pitched in $200 or less, but Super PAC contributions fell short of expectations. Great America PAC, the pro-Trump Super PAC led by Republican operative Ed Rollins, said in July it expected to pull in more than $20 million by now. Instead, it has raised just $11 million, according to the latest campaign finance disclosures. In a similar fashion, a pro-Trump Super PAC kicked off by Los Angeles real estate investor Tom Barrack, Rebuilding America Now, said in June it had $32 million in fundraising commitments.But it received just over $2 million that month. A spokesperson for the Super PAC says it has now raised $18 million. It will not file its next report until October 15.  The Republican kingmaker who was expected to be Trump's single biggest backer, casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, has scaled back his initial pledge of $100 million, made in a private meeting with Trump in May, to just $5 million, according to two associates close to Adelson familiar with the matter.CLINTON FINANCES

Democrat Hillary Clinton, who will face Trump in the Nov. 8 election, has received about a quarter of her campaign donations from people who contributed $200 or less - $71 million out of a total of $289 million, according to disclosures. Among the biggest backers to the pro-Clinton Super PAC, Priorities USA, were Donald Sussman, president of Paloma Partners Advisors, Inc, George Soros, chairman of Soros Fund Management, and Daniel Abraham, executive at SDA Enterprises.Clinton's money advantage will help her fund ad campaigns and get-out-the-vote efforts in the final stretch the 2016 election. She leads Trump by 4 percentage points nationally, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll.Together, Clinton's campaign and Super PAC have raked in a total of $520 million. By comparison, Trump's campaign and two Super PACs backing him have brought in a combined $200 million.Super PACs can raise unlimited money for candidates as long as they don't directly coordinate with the campaign.
The latest filings, which cover spending through August 31, showed a big increase in Trump's spending, with $30 million in disbursements, more than any month so far.They also provided further insight into the stark differences between the two candidates' operations.STARK DIFFERENCES 

The Clinton campaign's outlays reflect a traditional presidential playbook, spending five times more than Trump's has on television ads and nine times more on payrolls.The Trump campaign has spent $21 million on online advertising and strategy, $11 million on T-shirts, trucker hats and yard signs, and $4 million on field consulting. Trump recently scored a promise of a $1 million donation from the Ricketts family, which had previously backed a Super PAC opposing him, but he has yet to see the flurry of large checks that flowed into the coffers of former Republican White House rivals such as Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz. Instead of plowing money into the Trump campaign, Adelson -  like his fellow top conservative backers, the billionaire industrialist Koch Brothers - will focus his efforts and donations on Senate and House of Representatives races, two sources said.Tuesday night's filings show Adelson and his physician wife Miriam gave $20 million to the Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican Super PAC. The Adelsons plan on giving an additional $20 million to the Super PAC that backs Republican House candidates, the sources said.(Corrects date) (Reporting by Michelle Conlin and Grant Smith; Editing by Caren Bohan and Tom Heneghan)"

By Sarah N. Lynch
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A U.S. congressional committee has launched an examination of the Food and Drug Administration's criminal office, raising questions about the unit's management and handling of cases involving food, drugs and devices.The House Energy and Commerce Committee told FDA Commissioner Robert Califf it is ""examining management concerns"" and ""possible morale concerns with the field offices"" of the Office of Criminal Investigations. The September 20 letter, signed by committee chairman Fred Upton and Tim Murphy, chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, seeks answers to a detailed list of questions by October 12.Among other issues, the House committee questions why George Karavetsos, director of the Rockville, Maryland-based FDA criminal office, is allowed to run the unit from an office in South Florida, near his home.An FDA spokeswoman said the agency received the letter and will respond to the committee directly.The House questions come two weeks after Reuters reported how some FDA agents complain criminal office managers have forced them to pursue cases involving mislabeled foreign-imported injectable drugs, at the expense of cases with more potential to protect the public health.Current and former agents complain they have turned into the ""Botox Police,"" spending thousands of hours chasing doctors who purchased authentic versions of Allergan's anti-wrinkle drug that were labeled for use in other countries.Some agents say their efforts have done little more than protect the pharmaceutical industry's high drug prices in the United States.Those concerns come as the criminal office has had mixed success in bringing cases. From fiscal year 2008-2015, Reuters found, more than half of all opened OCI cases were closed without action.
The House committee asked Califf to explain the process for how criminal cases get opened, and to provide statistics on OCI's arrests, convictions, case initiations and amount of money recovered.Reuters also reported on Karavetsos' relocation to Florida, a move that came less than two years after the FDA paid more than $25,000 to move him to Maryland.Karavetsos, in a prior interview, defended the office's efforts, saying statistics are not a fair measure of OCI's success because public health and safety will ""always trump the criminal investigation."" FDA Regulatory Affairs Associate Commissioner Melinda Plaisier defended Karavetsos' move to Miami, saying it was good for the FDA and his family.
The House committee letter also questions how the FDA responded to two prior reports, from the Government Accountability Office and the Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General, that were critical of the criminal office.The 2012 OIG report cited problems with how the Rockville-based office is run and concluded that field offices ""lack the discretion"" to open cases to address ""food and drug concerns prevalent in their locales.""The report cited a lack of independence within the FDA's criminal office. OCI is housed within the Office of Regulatory Affairs, which is responsible for compliance inspections and helps determine the criminal office's budget. The inspector general recommended structural changes to ""ensure the independence of investigations.""FDA leadership at that time rejected those suggestions.
The criminal office headquarters controls the opening of investigations. Some agents have questioned the office's priorities and say they have, on occasion, been told not to open cases involving other federal agencies.A September 2015 email from Robert West, the recently retired Special Agent in Charge of the Miami field office, is one example.West, in the email, contended agencies including the FBI, the HHS OIG and Homeland Security investigators ""were riding our coattails and were not bringing anything to the table.""Involving those agencies in an investigation from day one, he wrote, ""is unacceptable.""West previously declined interview requests. Reuters could not immediately reach him Tuesday through an FDA spokeswoman. (Editing by Ronnie Greene)"

By Amanda Becker and Emily Flitter
| WASHINGTON/HIGH POINT, N.C.

WASHINGTON/HIGH POINT, N.C. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton consulted national security advisers on Tuesday after weekend bomb blasts renewed fears of domestic attacks, as Republican Donald Trump accused her of pushing policies that made the United States less safe.The two rivals in the Nov. 8 election have been vying to portray themselves as the best equipped to protect the nation. The domestic security issue returned to the forefront after a New York City bomb injured 29 people, a pipe bomb went off and unexploded bombs turned up in separate incidents in New Jersey, and a man stabbed 10 people at a Minnesota mall. Clinton spoke by phone with former Defense Department official Michele Flournoy, former CIA deputy head Mike Morell and other advisers, her campaign said in an email. ""We can't lose our cool and start ranting and waving our arms,"" Clinton said on the call, according to her campaign in an apparent reference to Trump. ""We shouldn't toss around extreme proposals that won't be effective and lose sight of who we are. That's what the terrorists are aiming for.""The call was supposed to be open to news media, but when reporters called in, they could not hear anything. Clinton's campaign provided notes to reporters afterward.Clinton has called for better intelligence, new efforts to counter online recruiting of militants and smashing Islamic State strongholds in the Middle East.She has said Trump's rhetoric against what he calls ""radical Islamic terrorism"" is helping Islamic State recruit more fighters.
At a rally in High Point, North Carolina, Trump countered by saying that Clinton, as Democratic President Barack Obama's first secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, backed policies that made the United States less safe.""I'm much tougher than her on this horrible situation, but she goes around saying it's a recruiting tool,"" Trump said.The New York businessman accused Clinton of supporting policies in Iraq and Syria that he said allowed Islamic State to take root. Trump has pointed to the pullout of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011 - which occurred after the Obama administration and Iraqi leaders could not agree on the withdrawal - and what he has characterized as a push for regime change in Syria. A U.S.-led coalition has conducted air strikes on Islamic State in Iraq and northern Syria.Trump also criticized Clinton for supporting the entry of some Syrian refugees into the United States, reiterating his call for tougher vetting of people seeking admission. He has instead proposed safe zones for refugees, which he says Gulf states would fund.
""There's nothing like doing things with other people's money,"" Trump said at a rally later on Tuesday in Kenansville, North Carolina.On Monday, U.S. authorities arrested Ahmad Khan Rahami following a shootout with police in Linden, New Jersey, in connection with the Saturday night bombing in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. Rahami, 28, is a naturalized American citizen born in Afghanistan.Law enforcement officials were also investigating the stabbings, also on Saturday night, at the St. Cloud, Minnesota, mall as ""an act of terrorism. An off-duty policeman fatally shot the attacker, Dahir Adan, 20, whom an Islamic State news agency claimed as ""a soldier"" of the militant group. Reuters could not verify the claim.Adan came from a Somali family that settled in the United States.
'GRAVY TRAIN'
At the Kenansville rally, Trump said he would dislodge a political establishment that he said ignored working people.""They go to the same restaurants, they go to the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections, they write checks to the same think tanks and produce the same papers, it's a gravy train that never ends,"" Trump said.Democrats, in turn, criticized Trump's business activities. U.S. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid called the real estate developer a ""fraud"" in a speech on the Senate floor, pointing to his multiple bankruptcies and lawsuits.Clinton's campaign repeated its call for Trump to release his tax returns after The Washington Post reported Trump's charitable foundation had spent thousands of dollars to settle lawsuits involving his businesses.

By David Brunnstrom
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK China and the United States will keep developing positive relations no matter who wins November's U.S. presidential election, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told an economic forum in New York on Tuesday.Li declined to comment on which candidate he favored.Republican Donald Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on Chinese goods and push for tougher trade talks if elected. His Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has changed tack on trade, backing away from a Pacific trade pact she previously endorsed.Both candidates have been critical of China's assertive pursuit of territory in the South China Sea, a potential flashpoint in Asia and a cause of significant friction in relations between Washington and Beijing.Li, who was attending the U.N. General Assembly in New York, said the U.S. election was an internal affair for the United States, so what he could say was very limited, but he went on to remark:""No matter who gets elected in the U.S. presidential election, I believe that China-U.S. ties will continue to grow steadily and in a positive direction.""
Li responded to complaints from foreign business leaders about restricted access to the Chinese market by saying that China was open to foreign investment, although some economic sectors were not yet mature.""This process of them becoming more mature is also a process for them to open up and the areas of the Chinese economy open to foreign investment will only increase and China will only open its door even wider. The door will not close,"" he said.Referring to a U.S.-China Bilateral Investment Treaty that has been long in negotiation given disagreements about access to sectors the sides deem sensitive, Li said as long as both countries took a strong and pragmatic approach, they would be able to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
As an example of China's willingness to open up its markets,  Li said China had decided to designate a Chinese investment bank as a clearing bank for renminbi business in New York and welcomed foreign banks in the city which met eligibility requirements to become clearing banks for the currency.He also said China would soon allow imports of beef on the bone from the United States, now that Chinese quarantine procedures had been completed.Li pledged that China would not engineer a devaluation of its currency to boost exports for its economy, which is growing at its slowest rate in two decades. Some critics in Washington have charged that Beijing is still manipulating its currency, although the U.S. Treasury says its assessment is that it is not undervalued.
China's economy will continue its growth momentum this year, Li said.""I can say here that in the third quarter of this year, or until the end of this year, China's economy will maintain this momentum of steady growth."" China's growth target for this year is 6.5 to 7 percent. In the second quarter of this year, the world's second-largest economy grew 6.7 percent from a year ago, according to official data.

| UNITED NATIONS

UNITED NATIONS Both sides would benefit if Israel recognized it cannot permanently occupy Palestinian land and if Palestinians rejected incitement and recognized Israel's legitimacy, U.S. President Barack Obama told the United Nations on Tuesday.Obama's efforts to bring about an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement have failed over the nearly eight years he has been in the White House, with the latest push by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry collapsing in 2014.U.S. officials have held out the possibility Obama could lay out the rough outlines of a deal - ""parameters"" in diplomatic parlance - after the Nov. 8 presidential election and before he leaves office in January, but many analysts doubt this would have much effect.""Surely Israelis and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel ...(and if) Israel recognizes that it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land,"" Obama said.
Speaking at the General Assembly annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations for the last time as president, Obama also said Russia was trying to recover ""lost glory"" through force. He warned Russia that if it ""continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors, it may be popular at home, it may fuel nationalist fervor for a time, but over time it is also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less secure.""
Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014 after months of protests in Kiev ousted pro-Moscow Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich.On the international dispute over the South China Sea, Obama said: ""A peaceful resolution of disputes offered by law will mean far greater stability then the militarization of a few rocks and reefs."" 
China claims almost all of the South China Sea, through which ships carrying about $5 trillion in trade pass every year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims in the sea, which is also believed to be rich in energy resources and fish stocks.In July, an arbitration court in The Hague said China's claims to the waterway were invalid, in a case was brought by the Philippines. Beijing has refused to recognize the ruling. (Additional reporting by Arshad Mohammed and Michelle Nichols; Editing by Howard Goller and Grant McCool)"
