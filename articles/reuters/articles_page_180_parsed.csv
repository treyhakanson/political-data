By Emily Flitter and Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Supporters of U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump are more likely to describe African Americans as ""criminal,"" ""unintelligent,"" ""lazy"" and ""violent"" than voters who backed some Republican rivals in the primaries or who support Democratic contender Hillary Clinton, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll.Ahead of the Nov. 8 election to replace Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, the poll also showed significant numbers of Americans in both the Republican and Democratic parties view blacks more negatively than whites, harbor anxiety about living in diverse neighborhoods and are concerned that affirmative action policies discriminate against whites.Republicans in the survey expressed these concerns to a greater degree than Democrats, with Trump supporters presenting the most critical views of blacks.The poll, conducted between March and June, interviewed 16,000 Americans and included 21 questions on attitudes about race. It sought responses from voters who support Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, and her rival U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. It also surveyed supporters of U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich, the last two Republican candidates to drop out of the race.""Mr. Trump is an egalitarian who believes in supporting and protecting all people equally,"" said Stephen Miller, Trump's senior policy adviser, when asked about the poll. ""This is a stark contrast to Hillary Clinton, whose policies have been a disaster for African-American and Hispanic citizens.""A spokesman for Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the poll. (Graphic on racial attitudes of presidential candidates' supporters tmsnrt.rs/294chjP)CHARACTER TRAITS
Nearly half of Trump's supporters described African Americans as more ""violent"" than whites. The same proportion described African Americans as more ""criminal"" than whites, while 40 percent described them as more ""lazy"" than whites.In smaller, but still significant, numbers, Clinton backers also viewed blacks more critically than whites with regard to certain personality traits. Nearly one-third of Clinton supporters described blacks as more ""violent"" and ""criminal"" than whites, and one-quarter described them as more ""lazy"" than whites.Clinton is relying heavily on black voters to help her win the White House, and her victory over Sanders in the early state nominating contests was due in part to her overwhelming lead among African Americans.
When asked about where they wanted to live, 36 percent of Trump supporters said, ""I prefer to live in a community with people who come from diverse cultures,"" compared with 46 percent of Cruz supporters, 55 percent of Kasich supporters and 70 percent of Clinton supporters.Trump's supporters were more likely to be critical of affirmative action policies that favor minorities in school admissions or in hiring.Some 31 percent of Trump supporters said they ""strongly agree"" that ""social policies, such as affirmative action, discriminate unfairly against white people,"" compared with 21 percent of Cruz supporters, 17 percent of Kasich supporters and 16 percent of Clinton supporters.To be sure, not all Trump supporters expressed negative attitudes about blacks. No more than 50 percent of his supporters rated blacks negatively, relative to whites, on any of the six character traits in the poll.Yet when their answers to the poll questions were compared with responses from supporters of other candidates, Trump supporters were always more critical of blacks on personality traits, analysis of the results showed. 
The trend was consistent in the data, even when the results were filtered to include only white respondents to remove any impact that a different racial mix between Clinton and Trump supporters might play in the poll.The Trump supporters' views on affirmative action and neighborhood diversity do not necessarily reflect racial bias alone, said Michael Traugott, a polling expert and professor emeritus at the University of Michigan, who is not publicly supporting either Trump or Clinton. Rather, the results could also suggest anxieties about economic insecurity and social standing. Trump, whose supporters are mostly white, has promised to return manufacturing jobs to the United States, crack down on illegal immigration and pull out of global trade deals that he says have hurt American workers. ""The support for Trump is indicative of the support for the type of policies he is advocating,"" said Lawrence Brown, a professor at Morgan State University in Baltimore who writes about racism and has supported Sanders.Obama said in May that U.S. race relations have improved over the last three decades but that significant work still needs to be done. The issue of race has assumed great political prominence over the past two years, amid countrywide protests over police treatment of African Americans, economic disparity between blacks and whites, and court challenges to affirmative action and voting rights.
TRUMP FANS VS. CLINTON SUPPORTERS
The Reuters/Ipsos poll asked people to grade whites and blacks on a series of personal traits. The results were then analyzed to compare how each respondent rated whites with how they rated blacks.In nearly every case, Trump supporters were more likely to rate whites higher than blacks when their responses were compared with responses from Clinton supporters. For example, 32 percent of Trump supporters placed whites closer to the top level of ""intelligence"" than they did blacks, compared with 22 percent of Clinton supporters who did the same.About 40 percent of Trump supporters placed whites higher on the ""hardworking"" scale than blacks, while 25 percent of Clinton supporters did the same. And 44 percent of Trump supporters placed whites as more ""well mannered"" than blacks, compared with 30 percent of Clinton supporters.The online poll, which surveyed people over the age of 18 across the United States, was conducted during two periods in the 2016 election cycle.The first ran three weeks in March and April, while Cruz and Kasich were still competing with Trump for the Republican nomination. The second polling period covered nearly four weeks in May and June, after Kasich and Cruz had dropped out.

By Emily Stephenson and Amanda Becker
| MONESSEN, Pennsylvania/WASHINGTON

MONESSEN, Pennsylvania/WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Tuesday vowed to force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate the NAFTA trade agreement with the United States if elected, as part of an effort to protect and restore American jobs.Trump criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement as a U.S. job killer, saying he would be willing to scrap the pact if Canada and Mexico were unwilling to budge. He also tried to link Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to the deal on the eve of a meeting in Ottawa of the ""three amigos,"" the leaders of the three NAFTA signatories: the United States, Mexico and Canada. In his most detailed speech on trade, the presumptive Republican nominee said he would pull the United States out of negotiations for a deal among 12 Pacific Rim nations and promised to use executive power to resolve trade disputes with China.Trump also pledged to revive the U.S. steel and aluminum industry, speaking at an aluminum scrap company in Monessen, Pennsylvania, nearly 30 miles (50 km) south of Pittsburgh, the one-time American steelmaking capital.Trump has identified Pennsylvania as a state he believes he can wrest from the Democrats in the Nov. 8 election. He also campaigned on Tuesday in Ohio, which like Pennsylvania is a Rust Belt state. Democratic President Barack Obama won both states in 2008 and 2012, but manufacturing job losses have led to voter anxiety in the region.""I'm going tell our NAFTA partners that I intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal for our workers. And I don't mean just a little bit better, I mean a lot better,"" Trump said in Pennsylvania.If Canada and Mexico do not agree to renegotiate the pact, Trump said he would notify them under the agreement's terms ""that America intends to withdraw from the deal.""He tried to tie his Democratic rival to the pact, approved in 1993 during the administration of her husband, President Bill Clinton, as he called NAFTA one of the ""worst legacies"" of the Clinton years.On MSNBC after Trump's speech, Clinton spokeswoman Kristina Schake called the wealthy New York businessman the ""king of outsourcing,"" in an apparent reference to Trump-branded products such as suits and ties made overseas. 
""It was full of hypocrisy and misstatements and outright lies,"" Schake said.Trade has been a vulnerability for Clinton, who struggled for white, blue-collar votes in her Democratic primary race against U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who criticized her for supporting trade deals and said she was too close to Wall Street.  TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP
Trump echoed Sanders' criticism on Tuesday, saying Clinton supported the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, while she was secretary of state and only opposed it once she was running for president. Clinton's campaign said she opposed the agreement because it was not strong enough on currency manipulation and other areas.       
Clinton has said she will evaluate each trade deal on its merits but does not believe the TPP is good for U.S. workers.        Sanders now says he will vote for Clinton in November, although he has not formally withdrawn from the race.Trump said he saw no way to fix the TPP, calling it a ""death blow"" for American manufacturing. Although China is not part of the agreement, Trump said Beijing might try to enter it ""through the back door"" later on.Later, during a rally in St. Clairsville, Ohio, Trump said the deal was ""just a continuing rape of our country.""Just hours before Trump spoke, Clinton allies sought to pre-empt the planned trade speech by saying Trump's policies amounted to empty promises.Earlier, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told a trade conference in Washington that ""Trump embodies everything that is wrong with our current trade policy. He has consistently sent American jobs overseas to line his own pockets.""
The AFL-CIO, which collectively represents more than 12 million workers, making it the largest U.S. labor federation, endorsed Clinton this month.POPULIST ANGER
Both Clinton and Trump have acknowledged that Britain's vote to leave the European Union signaled a global economic frustration among working-class voters that could reverberate in the U.S. election.""There is a lot of legitimate anxiety, fear and even anger in many parts of our country because people feel like the economy has failed them,"" Clinton said in Denver on Tuesday. ""I think this is going to be one of the defining issues in this election.""Trump has seized on the historic Brexit vote to bolster his argument that voters are rising up against establishment leaders, saying Americans would reject the ""global elite"" and support his presidential candidacy.But Trump has broken with Republican Party orthodoxy in criticizing trade deals, and has threatened to slap tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports. His rhetoric has drawn criticism from many economists, who say such practices could spark trade wars.As Trump spoke, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is usually in sync with prominent Republicans on trade policy, said on Twitter: ""Under Trump's trade plans, we would see higher prices, fewer jobs, and a weaker economy.""

By Julia Edwards
| PHOENIX

PHOENIX The Obama administration is looking into whether it can challenge the Supreme Court's decision to block President Barack Obama's plan to spare millions of illegal immigrants from deportation, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Tuesday.        ""We will be reviewing the case and seeing what, if anything else, we need to do in court,"" Lynch told Reuters in an interview. Lynch did not say what legal options the Obama administration may pursue following a split decision by the Supreme Court justices last week that left in place a block on the executive action by a lower court. She said any future executive actions Obama may take on immigration would be left to the White House. In a wideranging interview on topics from gun control to the effect of the planned exit of Britain from the European Union, Lynch identified espionage from foreign nationals on U.S. companies as a ""tremendous problem.""The Federal Bureau of Investigation has reported a 53 percent increase in cases of economic espionage between 2014 and 2015 and the majority of cases involve Chinese nationals as culprits. 
Most recently, Xu Jiaqiang, 30, was charged with economic espionage and theft of trade secrets, for stealing software source code from his U.S. employer with the intent of benefiting the Chinese government. ""It is a matter of priority for us,"" Lynch said. ""When companies or industries are preyed upon by others, be they individuals, be they state actors who literally steal the fruit of their intellectual labors, essentially they are stealing from future generations also.""Asked to comment on the impact of Britain's decision at a referendum last week to leave the European Union, Lynch said the law enforcement relationships between the United States and both Britain and the European Union would remain strong. 
""We have very strong and positive relationship with law enforcement in the United Kingdom and, as of now, I do not see that changing in respect to the United Kingdom or the European Union,"" Lynch said. Asked about changes that should be made in the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando on June 12, Lynch did not say if the Justice Department or the Obama administration was working on more executive actions on gun control but would continue research on ""smart-gun"" technology.A smart gun is one that can only be fired by the authorized user, often by requiring a palm print, in order to prevent gun theft or accidental shootings.     
""That's going to be a longer-term project. One of the things that we want to make sure is that people who do own guns lawfully have a way to make sure that their family members are safe in the house with them,""Lynch said the Justice Department is looking to see if the federal government can move smart-gun research forward, including on technology that can be used by the military.Lynch also said that it was important for the Justice Department to look at individuals in the ongoing criminal investigation into the Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) emissions scandal.

By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton posted an 11 percentage point lead over her Republican rival Donald Trump, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, a small decline since late last week.The June 24-28 poll showed that 45.3 percent of likely American voters support Clinton while 34.1 percent support Trump, and another 20.5 percent support neither.Clinton's lead was 14 points on Friday, though she has generally been widening her advantage over the New York real estate magnate since mid-May, when the two were nearly tied.The former secretary of state, senator and first lady was bolstered in recent days by endorsements from members of the Republican establishment, including Henry Paulson, Treasury secretary under former President George W. Bush.
Her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, said last week he would vote for her to stop Trump even though his campaign said this was not a formal endorsement.Clinton is struggling to win over Sanders supporters after a hard-fought campaign for the nomination. Critics have assailed her over her handling of emails and a 2012 attack on a U.S. mission in Libya while secretary of state.
Trump got a brief boost in the days after the June 12 mass shooting in Florida, coming within nine points of Clinton as he fine-tuned a campaign promise to temporarily ban the entry of Muslim immigrants to shore up national security.His level of support so far in June, however, lags behind what his predecessor, Republican White House hopeful Mitt Romney, received in the same period in 2012. 
He has sparred with Republican leaders over his off-the-cuff rhetoric and lagged behind Clinton's campaign organization in both size and fundraising, worrying some of his allies. The poll included 1,099 likely voters and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3.4 percentage points.

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democratic U.S. presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders brought his firebrand rhetoric back to the floor of the Senate on Tuesday to condemn a White House-backed bill on Puerto Rico's financial crisis as ""colonialism at its worst.""Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who turned an unlikely presidential bid into a political movement to combat inequality, warned that legislation due for a crucial Senate vote on Wednesday would subject Puerto Rico to Republican trickle-down economics and favor ""vulture capitalists"" at the expense of the island's increasingly impoverished population.An aide said it was the first time Sanders has spoken in the Senate since December.""Does that sound like the kind of morality that should be passed here in the United States Senate?"" Sanders fumed during an eight-minute appearance to support an hours-long speech by Democratic Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, who opposes the bill.
The Vermont senator used his appearance to rail against details of the legislation, which would put much of Puerto Rico's management in the hands of a seven-member oversight board and require the island to pay $370 million over five years for the board's administration costs even as it cuts funding for education, healthcare and pensions.In an exchange with Menendez, Sanders said, ""How in God's name do you run up an administrative cost of $370 million,"" adding, ""I know this sounds so absurd that people may think I'm misleading them.""
""Would my friend from New Jersey agree that this is colonialism at its worst?"" asked Sanders, who announced last week that he would vote for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in her November election contest against Republican Donald Trump.""Oh absolutely,"" replied Menendez.
The Puerto Rico bill, which has already been passed by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, faces opposition from both sides of the aisle in the Senate. Nevertheless, the Obama administration and Republican leaders are trying to get the bill passed before a July 1 deadline, when the island is scheduled to make a $1.9 billion payment on its $70 billion debt.

By Julia Harte
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican U.S. Senator Ted Cruz on Tuesday accused the Obama administration of under-emphasizing the ""threat of radical Islam"" as he presided over a Senate hearing for the second time since suspending his presidential campaign in early May.President Barack Obama and top Justice Department officials have come under fire from conservatives for avoiding the term ""radical Islam"" when denouncing attacks by violent extremists who claim inspiration from Islamic State, such as the Orlando nightclub shooter. Administration officials have countered that focusing on the use of the phrase is a political distraction and gives fuel to Islamic State propagandists who say the United States has waged war against all of Islam.Absent from Tuesday's hearing before a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee were the two top Justice Department counter-terrorism officials whom Cruz had invited to testify.
""The Obama administration of course has declined to appear and explain its policies,"" Cruz said at the hearing, noting that the officials had not provided any reason for staying away.Justice Department spokesman Marc Raimondi said in an emailed statement that the department is ""focused on aggressively and successfully pursuing terrorist adversaries"" and on denying them ""unchallenged recruiting platforms to spread their messages of hate and intolerance.""
Democratic members of the subcommittee said national security policies more targeted at Muslims, such as presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's call for a ban on Muslim immigrants, would be unconstitutional and counter-productive.""We cannot fight radicalization with further radicalization,"" said Democratic Senator Christopher Coons of Delaware, adding at the end of the hearing that he did not think ""arguing over semantics"" for three hours had helped improve American national security.
Experts from Muslim and Arab advocacy groups as well as former government national security officials testified at the hearing, representing both sides of the debate over whether the administration emphasizes Islam too much or too little in its counter-extremism policies.Protesters with Code Pink, an anti-war advocacy group, offered Cruz packs of gum labeled ""Islamophobin"" as he entered the hearing room, telling him it could cure Islamophobia.
