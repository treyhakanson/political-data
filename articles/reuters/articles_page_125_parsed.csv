By Steve Holland
| JACKSON, Miss.

JACKSON, Miss. Nigel Farage, a key figure in the successful campaign to get Britain out of the European Union, lent his support to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday, saying Trump represented the same type of anti-establishment movement that he masterminded in his own country.Farage appeared with Trump before a cheering crowd of thousands at a rally in Jackson, Mississippi. Farage partly based his Brexit drive on opposition to mass immigration to Britain that he said was leading to rapid change in his country. His appearance came as Trump sought to moderate his own hardline stance against illegal immigration. In remarks broadcast on Wednesday, Trump backed further away from his vow to deport millions of illegal immigrants, saying he would be willing to work with those who have abided by U.S. laws while living in the country.Trump summoned Farage on stage in the middle of his appearance, shook his hand and surrendered the microphone to him.Farage said he would not actually endorse Trump because he did not want to repeat what he called President Barack Obama's meddling in British affairs when Obama urged Britons to vote to stay in the EU.""I cannot possibly tell you how you should vote in this election. But you know I get it, I get it. I'm hearing you. But I will say this, if I was an American citizen I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton if you paid me,"" Farage said.""In fact, I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton if she paid me,"" he added.Trump has sought to align himself with the Brexit movement, noting he had said before the June 23 referendum that Britons should vote to leave. He visited one of his golf courses in Scotland the day after the vote and boasted that he had predicted the outcome and called it a sign his own campaign would be successful.
Trump has since tumbled in national opinion polls and is fighting to remain competitive with Democratic rival Clinton with little more than two months to go until the Nov. 8 election.""November 8 is our chance to redeclare American independence,"" Trump said, borrowing a phrase Farage used during the Brexit campaign.'FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY'
Farage drew parallels between the Brexit movement and the support Trump has received from many Americans who feel left behind by Washington.
""They feel people aren't standing up for them and they have in many cases given up on the whole electoral process and I think you have a fantastic opportunity here with this campaign,"" he said.Trump's comments on immigration came in the second part of an interview conducted on Tuesday with Fox News anchor Sean Hannity. They signaled a further softening in his immigration position as he tries to bolster support among moderate voters and minority groups.Trump, who defeated 16 rivals for the Republican presidential nomination in part based on his opposition to illegal immigrants, said he would not permit American citizenship for the undocumented population and would expel lawbreakers.To qualify to remain in the United States, Trump said, illegal immigrants would have to pay back taxes.
""No citizenship. Let me go a step further - they'll pay back taxes, they have to pay taxes, there's no amnesty, as such, there's no amnesty, but we work with them,"" Trump said.""But when I go through and I meet thousands and thousands of people on this subject, and I've had very strong people come up to me ... and they've said: 'Mr. Trump, I love you, but to take a person who's been here for 15 or 20 years and throw them and their family out, it's so tough, Mr. Trump,'"" Trump said. ""It's a very hard thing.""Trump said he would outline his position soon.""Well, I'm going to announce something over the next two weeks, but it's going to be a very firm policy,"" Trump told WPEC, a CBS affiliate in West Palm Beach, Florida.Trump's new position seemed to resemble in some respects the failed 2007 reform push by former Republican President George W. Bush. That effort offered a way to bring millions ""out of the shadows"" without amnesty and would have required illegal immigrants to pay a fine and take other steps to gain legal status.

WASHINGTON WikiLeaks founder and editor-in-chief Julian Assange said on Wednesday his organization planned to release ""significant"" information linked to the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton before the Nov. 8 election.Asked if the data could be a game-changer in the election, the Australian told Fox News in an interview conducted by satellite: ""I think it's significant. You know, it depends on how it catches fire in the public and in the media.""Assange has been living in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London for five years to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faces sexual assault accusations. He denies the allegations.  WikiLeaks released files in July of what it said were audio recordings pulled from the emails of the Democratic National Committee that were obtained by hacking its servers. 
That release, during the Democratic National Convention where Clinton was officially named the party's presidential nominee, was the second batch in a series that deeply rattled the party and prompted the committee's chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, to step down. 
""I don't want to give the game away, but it's a variety of documents, from different types of institutions that are associated with the election campaign, some quite unexpected angles, some quite interesting, some even entertaining,"" Assange said when asked how the next revelations would compare with those in JulyWikiLeaks publishes leaked material, mostly from governments. In 2010, the organization published classified U.S. military and diplomatic documents in one of the largest information leaks in U.S. history.

By Rory Carroll
| SAN FRANCISCO

SAN FRANCISCO California lawmakers voted to extend the state's climate change fighting efforts out to 2030 on Wednesday, giving a new lease on life to the most ambitious greenhouse gas reduction program in the country.The state Senate voted 25-13 in support of a bill that sets a target of cutting the state's output of heat-trapping emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. The state is currently on track to meet its 2020 goal of reducing emissions back to 1990 levels. The vote came hours after the state Assembly passed a linked bill to increase legislative oversight of the climate change programs run by the California Air Resources Board by a vote of 44-28.Both bills will now go to Governor Jerry Brown, who has said he will sign them. 
Senator Fran Pavley, the author of the 2006 law that set the state's first emission reduction target, said that effort has generated billions of dollars in investment in the state's clean energy sector while creating jobs and reducing emissions. ""Today's action will ensure the state remains on its prosperous and healthy course,"" she said. At a press conference, Brown said the legislation would impact all industries in the state from oil refining and agriculture to building construction and public utilities. 
""It's about the world in which we live becoming decarbonized and sustainable,"" he said. ""These regulations will work to achieve that goal,"" he said. Opponents said the emissions targets have caused job losses in the communities they represent. ""The impacts in my county are immense,"" Senate Republican Leader Jean Fuller, who represents Bakersfield, said prior to the vote on Wednesday. 
She said the current policies have driven hundreds of energy jobs out of her county, which is home to oil producers and manufacturers. ""The changes it has brought to our economy are unforgiveable,"" she said.Lawmakers did not address a central threat to the state's carbon cap-and-trade program from the California Chamber of Commerce, which has filed a lawsuit arguing that the state's quarterly carbon permit auctions amount to an illegal tax on businesses.Both climate bills are silent on the question of what policy mechanisms - such as cap and trade - should be used to achieve the 2030 goal. Brown, a staunch supporter of cap and trade, told reporters all options, including a ballot measure in 2018, were on the table to ensure the future of the carbon market. "	[]	[]

By Ginger Gibson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called on pharmaceutical company Mylan NV to voluntarily drop the price of its severe allergy treatment drug EpiPen, which has increased in price by more than 400 percent in the past decade.""That's outrageous - and it's just the latest troubling example of a company taking advantage of its consumers,"" Clinton said in a statement. ""It's wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients, raising prices without justifying the value behind them.""Clinton frequently said during the primary that she would fight pharmaceutical companies - part of an attempt to counter criticism that she was too closely tied to the insurance industry. She has released a proposal that she says will lower drug costs for consumers.Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin did not respond to inquiries about Clinton's criticism of the company. Mylan acquired the product in 2007, and the price increased from $100 in 2008 to its current cost of $600.Shares of Mylan closed down more than 5 percent at $43.15 on the Nasdaq.""The price of EpiPen is outrageous,"" said Robert Weissman, president of consumer watchdog group Public Citizen. ""Mylan is endangering lives and ripping off the country.""Weissman said EpiPen's U.S. price should be rolled back sharply, noting the product is available for as little as $112 in Canada. Many other drugmakers also routinely raise prices of their prescription drugs by 10 percent or more each year, and U.S. legislation is needed to prevent such ""price spikes,"" he added.
The White House took a more cautious tone in criticizing rising drug costs, refusing to comment on the decisions of an individual company. ""I will observe, however, that pharmaceutical companies that often try to portray themselves as the inventors of life-saving medication often do real damage to their reputation by being greedy and jacking up prices in a way that victimizes,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at a news briefing.    Clinton joins a bipartisan group of lawmakers who are calling for investigations into the price increase of EpiPens, which are preloaded injections of epinephrine (adrenaline) that people use if they are having a dangerous allergic reaction that untreated could result in death. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote Mylan earlier in the week to ask for an explanation of the price change. Senator Amy Klobuchar, the top Democrat on the committee's antitrust subcommittee, called for an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission.
On Wednesday, Republican Senator Susan Collins and Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill requested that Mylan provide a briefing for the Senate to explain the price change.Grassley and Klobuchar, along with Democratic Senators Patrick Leahy and Richard Blumenthal and Republican Senator Ron Johnson, on Wednesday said they had written to the Food and Drug Administration to ask about its approval process for alternatives to the EpiPen.""Given the importance of this topic, it is imperative to understand the FDA's role with respect to EpiPens and its approval of generic equivalents that could help to increase competition and lower prices if introduced,"" the senators said in a statement.  ""We have reached out to every member of Congress who has sent us a letter, and we look forward to meeting with them and responding to their questions as soon as possible,"" Devlin said. 
In January, Clinton admonished Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc, which raised the price of a heart drug. In the wake of a Clinton campaign blog post targeting Valeant, the company's stock fell. In March, she released a campaign ad vowing to target the company specifically. Clinton also criticized Turing Pharmaceuticals in the fall of 2015 when public ire rose after it decided to raise the price of an antiviral medication commonly used by AIDS patients and pregnant women from $13.50 a tablet to $750 each. After a single post by Clinton on the social media website Twitter critical of Turing, the company's stock price tumbled. At that time, Clinton released a comprehensive drug price plan that she says would reduce costs. Her proposal includes capping monthly out-of-pocket costs, expanding generic drug access and allowing Americans to buy pharmaceuticals abroad. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has said little about lowering drug prices. He has proposed increasing the amount of negotiations permitted by Medicare in order to lower prices for those using the program.

By Alexander Winning and Olga Popova
| MOSCOW

MOSCOW When Donald Trump named a little-known U.S. energy consultant as part of his foreign policy team, the adviser's ex-boss was puzzled; how could the relatively junior banker he knew in Moscow a decade ago be qualified to brief a presidential candidate?Carter Page, who worked in Russia at U.S. investment bank Merrill Lynch, paints an impressive picture of his three-year stint from 2004, saying on his company's website that he advised on ""key"" transactions involving some of the country's biggest energy groups.But Sergey Aleksashenko, who became head of the bank's Moscow operation toward the end of Page's assignment, expressed  doubts about whether he has the experience to act as an adviser on Washington's fraught ties with the Kremlin.""For me it was a strange choice,"" said Aleksashenko, who served as a deputy finance minister and deputy central bank governor in the 1990s before running Merrill Russia in 2006-2008. ""Carter was never a person who would discuss foreign policy or U.S.-Russian relations."" The achievements of Page - whom Trump named as an adviser in March - are summarized on the website of New York-based Global Energy Capital LLC, a firm that he founded after leaving Merrill. He did not respond to Reuters questions about his time in Russia and Merrill Lynch declined comment.When contacted by Reuters, Trump's spokeswoman Hope Hicks played down Page's role in the campaign. ""Mr. Page is an informal adviser named as part of a much larger group several months ago. He does not speak for or represent the campaign in any official capacity,"" she said.Trump, who is now the Republican nominee, named Page as being among five foreign policy advisers in an interview with The Washington Post on March 21. Hicks did not answer Reuters questions seeking to clarify what Page had done since then for the campaign and why Trump had picked him.    Aleksashenko, a Kremlin critic, was Page's boss in 2006-07 and is now a nonresident senior fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institution in Washington.  Three other former Merrill employees in Moscow also told Reuters that Page could not have played a leading role in the bank's deals due to his rank, and at the time showed no real interest or expertise in foreign policy.Shortly after Trump named his foreign affairs team,  campaign member Sam Clovis said the aim was to recruit people with ""real-world"" and military experience rather than the retreads that other candidates relied on.""These are people who work for a living,"" the New York Times quoted Clovis as saying. ""If you're looking for show ponies, you're coming to the wrong stable.""Clovis was not immediately available for further comment.FLATTERING COVERAGE

Russia has been a central issue in the U.S. election campaign, with Trump calling President Vladimir Putin a ""strong leader"". Flattering coverage of Trump in Russian state media has left little doubt that he would be the Kremlin's preferred candidate over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Like Trump, Page holds views that contradict the Obama administration's stance on Russia and in recent years he has expressed them, reflecting the Kremlin's views on occasions.In a February 2015 article in the journal Global Policy, he said U.S. policy toward Russia had been ""misguided and provocative"" and blamed the State Department for precipitating the Ukraine conflict.In a speech given in Moscow last month, Page also criticized Western countries for what he said was their ""hypocritical focus on democratization"" in the post-Soviet world. At the event, he did not respond to questions about his time in Russia.Andrey Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, said Trump wanted to show the incompetence and weakness of the foreign policy pursued by the Democrats. Page was useful as his views fit with that aim, added Kortunov, who does not know the Trump adviser personally.""There are people in the U.S. who are bored with Ukraine, who think it is not an American problem that Washington should be involved in,"" said Kortunov, whose think tank is close to the Russian Foreign Ministry but who has also expressed independent views. Despite Hicks's comments, Trump's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told Reuters that when he left the campaign in late June, Page had ""definitely"" been an adviser to Trump.
Another member of the five-strong foreign policy team, Walid Phares, told Reuters on Aug. 19 that Page continued to advise Trump.A MID-TIER BANKER
The Global Energy Capital LLC website says Page was responsible for opening Merrill's Moscow office and that he was ""an advisor on key transactions"" for Russian firms including Gazprom, the world's top gas producer, and RAO UES, a power company that no longer exists.Reuters spoke to four former Merrill employees in Moscow, three of whom overlapped with Page, as well as three Moscow-based bankers who competed with the U.S. bank for business. With the exception of Aleksashenko, none agreed to speak on the record about their recollections which differ from Page's.""Page was a vice president at Merrill, a mid-tier banker who was not originating deals,"" said Aleksashenko. ""Gazprom was a VIP client and in no transaction with such a client could a vice president play a decisive role."" 
In an interview with Bloomberg in March, Page said he advised Gazprom on the purchase of a stake in the Sakhalin energy project in Russia's Far East from Shell.Aleksashenko said Merrill's contribution to that deal was merely to provide a straightforward document saying the transaction was at fair value to Gazprom shareholders, alongside other banks.Gazprom declined comment.Another ex-Merrill banker said: ""Page was a general dogsbody who would have sat in on most meetings and prepared documents.""A third ex-Merrill banker, whose comments were corroborated by Aleksashenko, said Merrill's business with Gazprom when Page worked there involved investor relations work.Page also said he worked on deals in central Asia. Two sources who were involved in the initial public offering of shares in Kazakh firm KazMunaiGas EP in 2006 said although Merrill was one of the IPO's managers, they did not remember Page participating in the deal.CLOSER TO THE COMPANY 
Bankers at rivals when Page worked in Moscow said Merrill was not the main bank Gazprom turned to when it needed to raise capital, although the U.S. bank handled its investor relations. Merrill did act as a manager on two Gazprom Eurobonds when Page worked in Moscow but Tom Adshead at Moscow-based consultancy Macro-Advisory, which helps foreign investors in Russia, said it was not a major player with the energy group.""There are other bankers who were viewed in the market as being closer to the company,"" said Adshead, who worked in Moscow as an analyst and was a fund manager at the time that Page was at Merrill.Merrill Lynch declined to respond to Reuters questions on Page's work with the bank in Moscow.

5	5	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll-exclusive-idUSKCN10Z2MO	Exclusive: Clinton leads Trump in key swing states, would likely win election - poll	"


By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK If the U.S. presidential election were held today, Democrat Hillary Clinton would win the key swing states of Florida, Ohio and Virginia and have a 95 percent chance of beating Republican Donald Trump to become America's first female president, according to the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project.The project, which combines opinion polls with an analysis of voting patterns under different election scenarios, shows Clinton currently beating Trump in the popular vote by six percentage points and ahead in 19 states, including most of the larger-population ones that heavily influence the outcome of the election.At the moment, Clinton would win at least 268 votes in the Electoral College, the body that ultimately chooses the next president, just two shy of what she needs to win the White House. On average, the former secretary of state would win by 108 electoral college votes.Trump would win at least 21 states, many of them with smaller populations, giving him a minimum of 179 electoral votes.The election is still 10 weeks away, and a great deal could change prior to Nov 8. The candidates are running about even in eight states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina, and the polling sample is too small to determine the winner in Alaska, Wyoming and Washington D.C. But Trump would need to win the 21 states currently in his column and sweep all of the remaining ""toss-up"" states to win the presidency.That is a steep challenge for Trump, whose bare-knuckled, anti-establishment campaign helped him win the Republican Party's nomination but has so far failed to build broad support with voters.If Trump cannot draw in far greater numbers of women, moderate Republican voters and minorities, he will almost surely lose the White House race, according to the polling project.Consider, for example, what would be an ideal scenario for Trump: white men with below-average incomes showing up in record numbers on Election Day. This group strongly favors the real-estate mogul, yet even if all of them vote it wouldn't hand Trump any of the states currently slated for Clinton or any of the toss-up states. Clinton would still win the election.
The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project is driven by an online survey that gathers responses from about 16,000 people per week. Respondents answer questions about their demographic background, their party affiliation and their choice for president. Their responses are weighted according to the latest population estimates, and each respondent is ranked according to their likelihood to vote.Once the poll is complete, the project tallies the levels of support and estimated error for both candidates, and then runs multiple election simulations given their respective support. A separate set of simulations is run for each state and Washington D.C. The project runs more than 25 million simulations to determine the chances that one candidate would win.

Representatives from the Clinton and Trump campaigns did not respond to requests for comment on the project. OCTOBER SURPRISE?

A polarizing candidate, Trump has called for a more extensive border wall with Mexico, a ban on Muslim immigrants and a rejection of international trade agreements. His personal attacks, including his criticism of the parents of a Muslim-American soldier killed in action, have undermined his support within the Republican establishment.Still, Clinton is far from guaranteed a victory in November.A majority of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of both Trump and Clinton, and nearly one out of four likely voters says they do not support either of them for president, according to a separate Reuters/Ipsos poll.The candidates are scheduled to square off in a series of televised debates, and a poor showing by either could quickly change the dynamic of the race. A strong showing by a third party candidate could also influence the outcome.
Democratic Party operatives also fear there may be more revelations about ties between wealthy foreign donors to the Clinton family charity, the Clinton Foundation, and the State Department under her stewardship. Clinton has denied any impropriety but Trump has seized on the disclosures as a new line of attack against his rival.""There's always a chance of an October surprise - something definitive and striking about Clinton - that could change the race,"" said Tom Smith, who directs the Center for the Study of Politics and Society at the University of Chicago. ""But, short of any scandals by the Clintons, I just don't see any way that Trump catches up.""If Trump were to rely heavily on support from white voters, he would face an extremely narrow path to victory. Even if all male and female white voters showed up at the polls, and turnout among blacks and Hispanics was half of what it was in 2012, respectively, the project shows Clinton would still be favored to win.It appears that Trump's best chance is to turn out Republican voters in huge numbers and hope that a lot of Democrats stay home.There's only one problem with this: Republicans appear to have turned out as strongly as Democrats only once in presidential elections since at least 1976. That was in 2004, when the electorate was made up of 37 percent of Republicans, 37 percent of Democrats and 26 percent of Independents, according to exit poll data collected by the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at Cornell University.""There's still a lot of this demolition derby of an election to go,"" said Donald Green, a political scientist at Columbia University. ""A lot of people who support Trump don't have a very good record of voter turnout, and who knows if they show up this time.

By Steve Holland
| AUSTIN, Texas

AUSTIN, Texas U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump held out the possibility on Tuesday of a softening of his hardline position on illegal immigration, a move that could help move him to the political center but hurt him with his most ardent supporters.In an immigration town hall event with Fox News anchor Sean Hannity, Trump was asked whether he would be willing to change U.S. law to accommodate those illegal immigrants who have been contributing to American society, obeyed laws and have children.""There certainly can be a softening because we're not looking to hurt people,"" Trump replied, insisting there were some ""great people"" among the immigrant population.It was the latest example of Trump appearing to waver on his long-held stance he would deport all illegal immigrants back to their home countries. His new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told CNN on Sunday that Trump's proposed ""deportation force"" for the 11 million people in the United States illegally was ""to be determined.""Later on Tuesday, at a rally in Austin, Trump appeared to shift his emphasis to dealing with illegal immigrants who commit crimes in the United States. He brought on stage eight mothers whose children were killed by illegal immigrants.Trump ticked off a series of statistics about crimes committed by some illegal immigrants and vowed that would be stopped under his presidency.""Not going to happen, folks,"" he said. ""We're not going to let it happen to our country.""Trump, who postponed an immigration speech originally planned for Thursday in Denver, said he would stop some major cities' practice of providing sanctuary for illegal immigrants and stop immigrants from overstaying their visas.
A move by Trump to modify his stance on immigration could help him attract more support among moderate voters in his uphill drive to win the Nov. 8 election.The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Democrat Hillary Clinton expanding her lead over Trump to 12 points among likely voters, with 45 percent support to 33 percent for Trump.But a change in Trump's position could prove to be dispiriting to some of his strongest supporters. Trump defeated 16 rivals for the Republican presidential nomination and one factor that helped him was being the most hardline candidate on immigration. ""Why would anyone be surprised that Trump has pivoted to becoming the 'amnesty' candidate?"" said Republican strategist Rick Tyler, a former spokesman for U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a conservative. ""When you have no governing philosophy, pivots are par for the course. Guess we won't need Mexico to build that wall.""
'FOLLOW THE LAWS'
At his Austin event, attended by thousands who packed a rodeo arena, some were shouting: ""Build the wall"" long before Trump even showed up, a reference to the New York businessman's oft-stated promise to build a wall along the U.S. with Mexico and make Mexico pay for it.Some of those attending the event, however, liked that Trump might be offering a more expansive view on immigration.""I think he's saying the law needs to be looked at,"" said Barbara Thomas, a Trump supporter from the Austin area. ""I think it would be very hard for all of them to be deported. I think the system needs to be fixed. It has some problems.""
Immigration politics have long divided American voters. Then-President George W. Bush, a Republican, fought for changes to U.S. immigration laws in 2007 but the effort fizzled in the U.S. Congress. Democratic President Barack Obama's attempts have failed to bear fruit amid partisan gridlock.Trump insisted in the Hannity appearance he would ""follow the law.""""We have very strong laws in this country. And you know Bush, and even Obama, sends people back. Now, we can be more aggressive on that but we want to follow the laws,"" he said.His vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike  Pence, said in a CBS News interview that Trump would be ""tough but fair"" in dealing with illegal immigrants.""People who have run afoul of the law gotta leave immediately,"" Pence said. When pressed, he said the details would need to be worked out with Congress. (Reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Peter Cooney)"	['Pence', 'Cruz', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

LONDON Nigel Farage, an anti-immigration politician who was a figurehead of the successful campaign to get Britain out of the European Union, intends to address a Donald Trump rally on Wednesday, a spokesman said.Once dismissed by then-prime minister David Cameron as the leader of a party mostly consisting of ""fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists"", Farage had his revenge when the June 23 Brexit referendum went his way, forcing Cameron to resign. Trump, the U.S. Republican Party's presidential nominee, applauded the Brexit result, seeing the blow to British and EU political elites as a good omen for November when he hopes anti-establishment fervor will send him to the White House.Farage will tell Trump's rally in Mississippi ""the story of the Brexit campaign"", the spokesman said. 
There was no immediate confirmation from the Trump campaign.
Farage's future is unclear. He stepped down as head of the UK Independence Party  (UKIP) after the referendum delivered what he said was the main ambition of his 25-year political career - Britain leaving the EU.Often seen as an abrasive and controversial figure, Farage was marginalized by the official Vote Leave campaign which deemed him too divisive. He instead toured the country in a double-decker bus painted in UKIP's color, purple.

By Mark Hosenball
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is scheduled to receive a pre-election briefing from U.S. intelligence officials on Saturday, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.	Clinton, a former secretary of state, will receive the briefing, an overview of foreign policy and international security issues facing the United States, from career officials in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the source said. CNN reported that the briefing would be given to Clinton at the Federal Bureau of Investigation's field office in White Plains, New York, not far from the Chappaqua, New York, residence she shares with her husband, former President Bill Clinton. 
Representatives for relevant government agencies and Clinton's presidential campaign had no immediate comment.ODNI officials gave Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump his first intelligence briefing last week at the FBI's Manhattan office. A source said that because Trump asked for his briefing to be broken up into more than one session, he is expected to meet again with intelligence briefers.
Questions have been raised about the extent to which either candidate should be trusted with national security secrets, given the controversies surrounding the private email server Clinton used for State Department business and Trump's penchant for spontaneous comments and tweets.
Sources familiar with the content of the briefings said that while they contain information classified at the Top Secret level, they do not contain information about undercover espionage operations or U.S. intelligence sources and methods.
