SAN FRANCISCO Demonstrations protesting the U.S. presidential election victory of Republican Donald Trump entered their second week on Monday, with thousands of students chanting phrases like ""Not My President"" after walking out of classes across the country.The latest protests came as critics slammed Trump's selection of right-wing firebrand Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist, with many fearing the move could lift the white nationalist movement into the top levels of the White House.The Los Angeles Unified School District estimated that  4,000 students walked out of classes across the city in protest of the president-elect, who campaigned on deporting undocumented immigrants and building a wall between the United States and Mexico.Officials with Seattle Public Schools said about 5,000 students walked out of 20 high schools and middle schools on Monday. That figure represented about 10 percent of the district's student body, according to schools spokesman Luke Duecy. Authorities in Portland, Oregon, Montgomery County, Maryland, and the San Francisco Bay Area said hundreds of young people marched in protest as well. 
Tens of thousands of people have marched in cities from New York to Los Angeles in largely peaceful rallies since Trump's upset victory last Tuesday over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump secured enough votes in the 538-member Electoral College to win the presidency despite trailing Clinton in the popular vote.But there have been sporadic bouts of destruction. Demonstrators in Oakland, California, last week threw objects at police in riot gear and smashed storefront windows.
More than 100 people had been arrested following days of protest in Portland, Oregon, police said on Monday. Protesters in that city over the weekend blocked traffic and threw objects at police dressed in riot gear who responded with pepper spray and flash-bang devices.Civil rights groups and police have monitored violence against U.S. minorities since Trump's win, citing reports of attacks on women in Islamic head scarves, of racist graffiti and of bullying of immigrant children.Trump has called for peace and unity and denounced white supremacist groups that supported him. He said on Sunday he was ""so saddened"" to hear about racial slurs and personal threats made against African-Americans, Latinos and gay people by some of his supporters.
""I say, 'Stop it.' If it - if it helps,"" Trump told CBS' ""60 Minutes"" in an interview. (Reporting by Curtis Skinner in San Francisco; Editing by Peter Cooney)"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	['gay']

By Roberta Rampton
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President-elect Donald Trump is in for a quick wake-up call and will have to adjust his temperament when he confronts the realities of his new job on Jan. 20, President Barack Obama said on Monday.In a news conference at the White House, Obama said the freewheeling Trump could not be as outspoken as he was during the long and bitter campaign that ended last week with the Republican's surprise win over Democrat Hillary Clinton.    Subdued and carefully choosing his words, Obama gave what appeared to be dispassionate advice to his successor free of much of the partisan rancor that marked the election campaign.""This office has a way of waking you up,"" Obama said. ""Those aspects of his positions or predispositions that don't match up with reality, he will find shaken up pretty quick because reality has a way of asserting itself.""The two men met in the Oval Office last week to begin the transition of power. Obama said on Monday he believed Trump would be pragmatic in office and not approach the country's problems from an ideological perspective.""There are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well, unless he recognizes them and corrects them,"" Obama said.""Because when you're a candidate and you say something that is inaccurate or controversial it has less impact than it does when you're president of the United States. Everybody around the world is paying attention. Markets move,"" he said.Obama declined to wade into a controversy over Trump's appointment of right-wing firebrand Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist, saying it would ""not be appropriate"" for him to comment on Trump's appointments.But Obama, who criticized Trump's temperament during the campaign, said it was important for Trump to send signals of unity after the hard-fought campaign. He said the political gifts that allowed the Republican to upset Clinton would be put to good use in the White House.""I've been encouraged by his statements on election night about the need for unity, his interest in being president for all people,"" Obama said. ""In an election like this that was so hotly contested and so divided, gestures matter.""GIULIANI TO STATE DEPARTMENT? 

The president-elect, a businessman who has never held public office, and his transition team are working on picking members of his Cabinet and the heads of federal agencies.Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has emerged as a leading candidate for secretary of state, a source familiar with the process said. John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is also being considered for the job of the nation's top diplomat, the source added.Giuliani became one of Trump's closest advisers during the campaign, functioning as his most vocal defender on cable news programs and introducing him at many rallies. Giuliani has also been mentioned as a possible attorney general or homeland security secretary.A Trump transition team official denied media reports on Monday that Trump was seeking security clearance for three of his children and his son-in-law.Such clearance would allow Trump to discuss matters of national security with his daughter Ivanka, sons Eric and Donald Jr. and son-in-law Jared Kushner. Federal law prohibits him from hiring family members to serve in his administration, but all four played key advisory roles through the campaign.Trump has insisted that to avoid conflicts of interest, his children would run his sprawling business operations once he assumed the presidency.
ANGER OVER BANNON
Democrats, civil rights groups and even some Republicans slammed Trump for choosing Bannon as a key aide, saying it would elevate the white nationalist movement into the top levels of the White House.Making his first appointments since last week's upset win, Trump picked Bannon as his chief strategist and counselor, and Washington insider Reince Priebus as his chief of staff on Sunday, saying the two would share the task of steering his administration as ""equal partners.""The choice of Priebus was seen as a conciliatory signal of Trump's willingness to work with Congress. But critics blasted the selection of Bannon, who spearheaded a shift of the Breitbart News website into a forum for the ""alt-right,"" a loose online group of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites.""There should be no sugarcoating the truth here: Donald Trump just invited a white nationalist into the highest reaches of the government,"" said Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley, who called on Trump to rescind the choice.
The Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said Bannon's appointment sent ""an alarming signal that President-elect Trump remains committed to the hateful and divisive vision that defined his campaign.""Even some conservatives and Republicans voiced dismay on Bannon. Evan McMullin, who ran as a conservative independent presidential candidate, wondered on Twitter if any national Republican leaders would condemn the pick of ""anti-Semite"" Bannon.John Weaver, a top strategist for Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich, tweeted that the ""racist, fascist extreme right is represented footsteps from the Oval Office. Be very vigilant America."" Kasich was one of 16 Republican presidential hopefuls Trump defeated in the party primaries. Priebus defended Bannon on Monday, calling him a wise and well-educated former naval officer and saying he had not encountered the sort of extremist or racist views that critics are assailing.""He was a force for good on the campaign,"" Priebus said on Fox News, adding they were in agreement on ""almost everything"" in terms of advising the president-elect.Kellyanne Conway, Trump's former campaign manager and a senior adviser, told reporters in New York she was offended by the reaction to Bannon, describing him as a ""brilliant tactician.""Police in New York on Monday were investigating two cases involving swastikas drawn or painted in public spaces, as civil rights activists said there had been a surge in hate crimes following last week's election.Local media reported hundreds of students walked out of a high school to protest Trump on Monday in Silver Spring, Maryland, and students gathered at the University of Washington in Seattle to protest Trump.

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama's administration said on Monday he would veto legislation seeking to block financial transactions related to the export of passenger aircraft to Iran, saying it would undermine the nuclear deal implemented early this year.The legislation in the House of Representatives is the latest Republican-led effort to stop the sale of aircraft to Iran by Airbus and Boeing Co, allowed under the nuclear deal.The White House said U.S. partners would view the bill, if implemented, as a violation of the nuclear agreement. The United States plus Britain, Russia, France, China and Germany agreed to lift sanctions if Iran would curtail its nuclear program.The deals by Airbus and Boeing to sell or lease over 200 jets to IranAir would help modernize and expand the country's elderly fleet, held together by smuggled or improvised parts after years of sanctions.Some members of Congress have raised concerns that killing the sale could cost jobs. But opponents argue that the passenger aircraft could be used for military purposes such as transporting fighters to battle U.S. troops or allies in Syria.
The measure would bar the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing a transaction by a U.S. financial institution related to the export, or re-export, of commercial aircraft to Iran. And it would revoke any authorities enacted before the bill passed, such as those that allowed the Boeing and Airbus sales.The measure also limits the role of Export-Import Bank financing of sales to Iran.Some banks have been reluctant to finance the aircraft deals, fearing they could fall foul of remaining sanctions prohibiting the use of the U.S. financial system for Iranian business.
The House is expected to take up, and pass, the measure as soon as this week.It is not expected to get through the Senate, where it would need Democratic support to advance.
Lawmakers expect more efforts to stop the aircraft sale, and the broader Iran deal, after Donald Trump becomes U.S. president in January.Trump has been critical of the nuclear agreement, which is seen by Obama supporters as one of the Democratic president's signature foreign policy achievements.

By Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Nancy Pelosi may face a challenge to her 14-year-old role as the leading Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives now that Republicans have captured the White House and maintained their grip on Congress.Representative Tim Ryan, 43, of Ohio, is weighing a run against Pelosi, 76, who is the House minority leader and former speaker of the House, said Ryan's spokesman Michael Zetts. The party vote for minority leader is scheduled for Thursday.""He is concerned that if changes aren't made we will be in the political wilderness for many years to come,"" Zetts said. It was unclear how much support Ryan might have. He has been in the House since 2003.Voters who elected Republican Donald Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8 also gave Democrats a few more seats in the 435-member U.S. House of Representatives and the 100-member Senate, but Republicans held on to their majorities in both. Democrats had expected to do much better; some had predicted double-digit wins in the House.Pelosi, of California, faced calls from Representative Seth Moulton and other Democrats, dismayed by the election results, to postpone the party's leadership election until later in November while a reassessment is made.
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, may have given some ammunition to Pelosi's detractors on Monday when he said, ""I kind of like Pelosi staying around. As long as she's there, I think we stay in the majority.""The new Congress convenes on Jan. 3; Trump will succeed President Barack Obama, a Democrat, on Jan. 20. In the U.S. Senate, New York's Chuck Schumer is expected to replace the retiring fellow Democrat Harry Reid as minority leader.
In the Republican party, no one is challenging Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and House Republicans are expected on Tuesday to nominate Paul Ryan to remain House speaker. Ryan would face an election in January, when all members of the new House, both Democrats and Republicans, vote on a new speaker. Before Trump's win, some Republican conservatives angered by Ryan's tepid support for Trump were talking about trying to block his re-election. Those threats have subsided but not vanished.
An aide to New York Republican Representative Chris Collins said, ""Congressman Collins fully believes Speaker Ryan is a slam dunk to be re-elected as speaker, and looks forward to working with him in the next Congress."" Collins was Trump's first supporter in the House.Some conservative Republicans still have doubts. ""Presently Speaker Ryan does not have my vote, but I will listen to his message tomorrow,"" Representative Tom Massie of Kentucky said in a statement.

WASHINGTON The United States on Monday described as ""troubling"" an Israeli bill supported by a ministerial committee allowing settlers in the occupied West Bank to remain in homes built on private Palestinian land and said it hoped the law does not pass. ""We are deeply concerned about the advancement of legislation that would allow for the legalization of illegal Israeli outposts located on private Palestinian land,"" State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau told a briefing.If the law were enacted it could pave the way for the legalization of dozens of illegal outposts deep in the West Bank, she said, adding:""This would represent an unprecedented and troubling step that's inconsistent with prior Israeli legal opinion and also break longstanding policy of not building on private Palestinian land,"" Trudeau said.
The U.S. believes settlements endangered prospects for a two-state solution and Israeli-Palestinian peace, she said. ""We hope it doesn't become law,"" Trudeau added.
The ministerial committee defied Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and voted on Sunday to back the bill, which will be debated by parliament on Wednesday and is still some distance from becoming law.Israel's attorney-general, Avihai Mandelblit, has called the bill legally flawed in its current form, saying that it contravened private property rights legislation and did not tally with Israel's international law commitments.

By Piya Sinha-Roy
| LOS ANGELES

LOS ANGELES After parleying a professional wrestling career as ""The Rock"" into leading roles in Hollywood, Dwayne Johnson is entertaining the idea of jumping into the political ring, including perhaps even a run for the White House someday.Johnson, 44, who stars in the upcoming Disney animated film ""Moana"" as the voice of demigod Maui, told Reuters the excitement surrounding last week's presidential election had renewed public interest in him running for office.""I love my country, I'm extremely patriotic and I also feel, especially now, leadership is so important, great leadership is so important, respected leadership is so important,"" said Johnson, star of ""The Fast and the Furious"" franchise Asked specifically about a potential White House run, Johnson replied: ""If I felt like I could be an effective leader for us, and surround myself with really high-quality leaders, then sure, I would."" 
It is not the first time Johnson's name has been mentioned in political circles.Earlier this year, Johnson took to Instagram to thank a Washington Post journalist who said he had a ""weirdly plausible path to a political career"" as a mixed-race registered Republican from Florida, a swing state in the presidential election. While Johnson did not specify which office he might seek, when he might run or which party he would represent, he said he thought that running a business as a producer in Hollywood had given him a discipline he hoped he could apply to politics. 
""I've found really good success in being able to galvanize people in a positive way and continued to push them, as I've pushed myself along the way too, because I walk what I talk, daily, which I think is an important quality,"" he said. If Johnson does take on politics, he would be following another pro wrestler, Jesse 'The Body' Ventura, who served as governor of Minnesota, and body builder-turned-action star Arnold Schwarzenegger, who served two terms as Republican governor of California.
Known for his catchphrase: ""Can you smell what The Rock is cooking,"" Johnson still participates in occasional World Wrestling Entertainment matches, alongside producing and starring in HBO's sports dramedy ""Ballers"" and the upcoming ""Baywatch"" film reboot.

8	8	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-issues-factbox-idUSKBN1392LI	Factbox: President-elect Trump's top goals, biggest hurdles	"

Republican Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to shake up Washington and as president the brash real estate mogul will be in a position to dramatically change how the United States handles immigration, trade and a range of other policies.Yet many of his more ambitious proposals will require cooperation from Congress after he takes office on Jan. 20. While he will may enjoy a post-election honeymoon with congressional Republicans, a long-lasting romance is far from guaranteed, given his uneasy relationship with congressional leaders and some basic ideological differences he has with Republican orthodoxy.Following is an overview of Trump's top policy plans:TRADE
In his campaign, Trump argued that international trade agreements had hurt U.S. workers and the country's competitiveness. He has promised to ""get tough"" on China and withdraw from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, which is still not finalized. As president, Trump does have some power to raise tariffs on countries such as China. President Barack Obama's administration has suspended its efforts to win congressional approval for TPP, saying its fate was up to Trump and Republican lawmakers.Trump has also said he would renegotiate or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement, the 1994 free-trade deal with Mexico and Canada. Both Canada and Mexico have indicated they are willing to discuss the agreement with Trump. Canada has indicated it would consider a free-trade agreement that excludes Mexico.Economists have warned that such moves would damage the economy by forcing consumers to pay dramatically higher prices on everything from refrigerators to T-shirts. U.S. exports, such as airplanes and soybeans, would likely suffer as well.     IMMIGRATION
Trump has promised to build a wall along the Mexican border, deport millions of undocumented immigrants and ban immigration from countries that have been ""compromised by terrorism."" Since his election, he has said parts could be a fence instead of a wall, and he would act to deport up to 3 million immigrants in the country illegally who have criminal records. It was unclear where his figure comes from. Think tank Migration Policy Institute estimated in a 2015 report there were 820,000 unauthorized immigrants with criminal records.   Those policies would not come cheap. Trump has estimated the wall would cost $8 billion to $12 billion. Other estimates have run much higher.Politico estimated it would cost at least $166 billion to deport all of those in the country illegally and complete a border wall. While many congressional Republicans support those policies, they might blanch at the cost.Trump has said he would force Mexico to pay for the wall, but he has no power to force another country to spend money on something it does not want. Trump also promised to withhold federal funds from ""sanctuary cities"" such as New York and Los Angeles that shield people who are in the country illegally.    More broadly, Trump could shift the broader debate over immigration, empowering skeptics like Republican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama who want to reduce overall immigration levels and reduce the number of skilled guest workers. That would be a blow to business groups and Hispanic advocates who have sought to relax immigration laws.HEALTHCARE

Trump has promised to repeal President Barack Obama's signature Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, and replace it with a plan that would give states more control over the Medicaid health plan for the poor and allow insurers to sell plans nationally.He would need Congress to act, and Republicans could have difficulty getting the 60 votes needed to advance a repeal effort through the 100-member Senate.Republicans could face a public backlash if they repeal a law that has provided healthcare to millions of Americans who previously had no healthcare.After the election Trump said he would consider retaining parts of Obamacare, including provisions letting parents keep adult children up to age 26 on insurance policies and barring insurers from denying coverage to people with existing conditions.TAXES AND SPENDING
Trump has vowed to make deep tax cuts, while also promising to protect popular health and retirement programs that account for more than a third of U.S. government spending.That combination of policies would massively increase the national debt, according to the nonpartisan Center for a Responsible Budget.He has also proposed increasing spending on the military and infrastructure, but has said he would reduce spending on categories other than health and retirement by 1 percent each year.On taxes, he would get plenty of help from Republicans in Congress, who have been laying the groundwork for a tax-code overhaul that would lower rates and close loopholes. But they will encounter fierce resistance from homeowners, businesses and other interest groups that benefit from current tax breaks.
Trump's promise to protect entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare will rile fiscal conservatives, who worry they will swamp the federal budget in the decades to come. But those programs are popular with the American public.WALL STREET REGULATION
Trump has promised a ""dismantling"" of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law enacted following the financial crisis, but has given few details.Both Trump and the Republican Party have called for reinstating Glass-Steagall, the 1930s-era law that forced the separation of investment banks from deposit-taking institutions.Republican lawmakers have so far been unable to undo many of their most-despised pieces of the Dodd-Frank law, and many in their ranks oppose a return to Glass-Steagall.Trump appears to be leaning toward weakening the law in a manner similar to what was proposed in a bill known as the CHOICE Act this summer by Jeb Hensarling, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee.     ISLAMIC STATE

Trump has offered few details about his plans to fight Islamic State but has said he would ""knock the hell out of"" the militant group. He says he is keeping the details of his strategy a secret so as not to disclose them to the enemy. Trump said that if he won, he would give U.S. generals 30 days after taking office on Jan. 20 to propose their own plans.Trump has said he opposes accepting refugees fleeing violence in Syria, and instead has said he would create ""safe zones"" there, which he says would be funded by Gulf states.Obama has said a safe zone in Syria would require a large U.S. military commitment, something that could prove to be unpopular with Americans weary of lengthy wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.RUSSIA
Trump has said he would have a ""very, very good"" relationship with Russia. Trump has said could work with Russia to combat Islamic State. He also said he would look into recognizing Crimea, seized from Ukraine in 2014, as Russian territory and lifting sanctions on Russia imposed by Western nations for what they called an illegal land grab.Trump has criticized the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, saying some U.S. allies have not met their defense commitments. In July, he said if Russia attacked a NATO member, he would consider whether the country has paid up before providing defense.NATO leaders say the sanctions against Russia are key to persuading it to change that country's behavior in Ukraine, where it has backed ethnic Russian separatists, and that the alliance has long been focused on fighting international terrorism.SUPREME COURT
With one vacancy on the Supreme Court and several more possible in the coming four years, Trump will have a chance to put a conservative stamp on the courts for decades to come.His list of potential nominees has won praise from conservative activists and Republicans in the U.S. Senate, who will be eager to help him in that area.CLIMATE CHANGE
Trump has called global warming a hoax and said he wants to cancel the 2015 Paris Agreement among almost 200 nations that entered into force on Nov. 4. Instead, he says he will push ahead and develop cheap coal, shale and oil. Trump's advisers are considering ways to bypass a theoretical four-year procedure for leaving the accord, according to a source on his transition team.

Trump has indicated he would prioritize a broad mix of policies, including tax cuts, infrastructure spending, the repeal or lessening of Dodd-Frank financial regulation, and changes to global trade arrangements.Decisions made by the new administration and Congress will have ""a significant impact on matters small and large"" for CalPERS and for investors globally, Eliopoulos said during a live Webcast of the meeting, the board's first since the U.S. presidential election last week. 
But it is ""much too early to talk with precision about these implications since we know very little,"" Eliopoulos added. ""We do need to be prepared to address a much different policy environment, new economic and investment challenges and opportunities and be ready to adjust, act, and govern ourselves accordingly,"" said Eliopoulos. 
CalPERS is the nation's largest public pension fund with approximately $300.7 billion of total fund market value.
