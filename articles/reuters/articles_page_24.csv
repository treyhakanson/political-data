By Tim Baysinger

The 2016 election cycle had been a ratings boon for U.S. cable news networks, and Tuesday's stunning U.S. presidential election victory by Republican Donald Trump was no different.Time Warner Inc's CNN led all U.S. TV networks in primetime coverage with 13.3 million viewers, the most-watched Election Night coverage in U.S. cable news history, according to Nielsen data. 21st Century Fox's Fox News came in second with 12.1 million viewers, and Comcast Corp's MSNBC was far behind with just under 6 million.Among adults aged 25 to 54, the demographic most important to advertisers who buy time on news programs, CNN was first as well with 6.7 million viewers. Fox News was second with 4.6 million and MSNBC drew 2.4 million in the demographic. All three posted gains from four years ago.
With many states too close to call, the race was not called for Trump until around 3 a.m. (0800 GMT) on the East Coast. Fox News led cable news with 9.8 million viewers watching between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. (0700 and 0800 GMT), with CNN bringing in 6.5 million and 2.9 million watching on MSNBC. Fox News also led all cable networks with their full coverage from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. (0000 to 0800), with 12.2 million, a network high for an election night. CNN pulled in 11.2 million for the whole night, but topped Fox News in the news demographic with 5.6 million to Fox News' 4.8 million. MSNBC brought up the rear with 5.2 million and 2.1 million in the demographic.
NBC led all the broadcast networks with 11.2 million viewers, with ABC finishing with 9.2 million and CBS pulling in 8.1 million. Fox averaged around 4 million for its two-hour coverage from 8-10 p.m. 
Across 13 U.S. TV networks, election night coverage was watched by 71.42 million viewers, just behind the U.S. record of 71.47 million that watched in 2008. (Reporting by Tim Baysinger in New York; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"

By Daniel Trotta
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Transgender advocates vowed on Wednesday to resist any effort to reverse or slow down an expansion of transgender rights made under President Barack Obama, fearing a rollback of his directives once Donald Trump succeeds him in the White House.During his eight years in the Oval Office, Obama championed lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, and Democrat Hillary Clinton had promised to keep fighting for them if she was elected.Same-sex marriage became legal in 2015, shifting the LGBT discussion to the still-unfinished agenda of transgender rights. Obama has issued regulations prohibiting health insurers from denying coverage based on gender identity and directed public schools to allow transgender students to use the public bathrooms of their choice, among other measures.""We expect that those will disappear,"" said Rachel B. Tiven, chief executive of Lambda Legal, a leading gay rights group. ""Lambda Legal will hold the line when our rights are under attack. We know how to fight the government in the courts.""Trump sent mixed messages on transgender rights during the campaign. But he promised to nominate a conservative justice to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court and could name an attorney general who may enforce hard-line positions Trump outlined during the campaign.
""We're going to fight them on anything they try to undo,"" said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality. ""I'm really worried today for trans Muslims and trans immigrants and trans people with disabilities who have been threatened and denigrated by Mr. Trump. Hopefully, that was all part of some sick performance.""With the U.S. Supreme Court split between four liberals and four conservatives, Trump could appoint a conservative to tip the balance, possibly in time to decide a case involving a transgender boy who has sued to use the male restroom at his public school in Virginia.Shannon Minter, legal director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, called Trump's victory ""a huge wake-up call"" that placed an onus on transgender people to ""explain who we are"" to Trump voters who may be intolerant of or ignorant about transgender people.
""In a very real sense, our lives, our ability to work, to attend school, to obtain health care, are at the mercy of a new administration,"" Minter said.Trump's Justice Department and appointees to the federal bench could also have an impact on two provisions of federal law banning discrimination on the basis of sex - Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which covers employment, and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.
The Obama administration has taken a firm stance that the reference to ""sex"" protects transgender people.The courts have generally agreed, and Jill Gaulding, co-founder and legal director of Gender Justice, said that trend was likely to continue regardless of who is president.""We can never take any rights for granted but I also think it's important to remember how much progress we have made in recent years and decades,"" she said. ""It's not easy to repeal that kind of progress."" (Editing by Frank McGurty and Dan Grebler)"

By Susan Cornwell and Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President-elect Donald Trump will have an early Capitol Hill honeymoon with Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress when he takes office in January, but a long-term romance may be more challenging.A president whose party controls both the Senate and House of Representatives can generally count on getting things done fairly quickly, and Trump likely will not be an exception, despite starting with unusual handicaps.Many Republicans in Congress only backed Trump after he became the candidate. Some never fell in line. He offended and attacked others while running as a Washington outsider, including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who did not campaign with him.On top of that, the New York real estate businessman and former reality television celebrity, who will head the world's most powerful government and largest economy, has no governing experience.On Wednesday, party leaders were quick to back the victor,  and they are expected to find more common ground than differences once he takes office.""Donald Trump will lead a unified Republican government,"" Ryan told a news conference in his home state, Wisconsin, promising to ""work hand in hand.""Ryan said his relationship with Trump ""is fine,"" the transition is under way, and he has already spoken to the president-elect twice, and to his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, a former House member.""Most of the things he's likely to advocate, we're going to be enthusiastically for,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told a news conference on Capitol Hill.OBAMACARE IN CROSSHAIRS
Trump and Republican leaders in Congress agree on one major policy: They want to repeal Democratic President Barack Obama's landmark Obamacare healthcare law, enacted in 2010.Ryan and McConnell both pledged to deal quickly with the law.They will also move quickly to confirm a Trump nominee for the Supreme Court, after McConnell refused to consider any Obama nominee to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February, infuriating the White House and Senate Democrats.
Other issues might be more contentious within the party.While campaigning, Trump spoke extensively about scrapping trade deals and building a wall along the U.S.- Mexico border, but some Republicans are skeptical about both those pledges.The party has long been in favor of free trade, and Trump's wall scheme would bear a $25 billion price tag and anger Mexico, an important ally and trading partner.McConnell said on Wednesday he wanted to achieve border security in whatever way was most effective. And he said the new president was free to negotiate trade pacts.Trump will also have to work with Democrats, who made narrow gains on Tuesday that reduced the size of the Republican majorities in the House and Senate.With some votes still being counted, they won a handful of new seats in the House.
In the Senate, they seemed to secure at least 48 seats, up from 46, on Wednesday when the New Hampshire secretary of state called a close race for New Hampshire Governor Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, over incumbent Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte, although Ayotte had not conceded.Controlling only 52 seats, Republicans will need Democrats to reach the 60 votes needed to advance most legislation in the 100-member Senate.""Trump will have to work with a fair number of Senate Democrats to get things done,"" said William Galston, an expert in governance studies at the Brookings Institution think tank.One of those things could be infrastructure spending, which Trump promised in his victory speech. Spending on infrastructure to fuel job growth is popular with lawmakers from both parties, possibly funded by ending a law that lets corporations hold profits offshore without paying U.S. taxes on them.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Trump Wednesday to say she wanted to work with him on a ""robust infrastructure jobs bill,"" and she told her fellow Democrats that this should be done very fast. ""We're not starting a campaign against the Republicans right now,"" Pelosi told Democratic lawmakers in a conference call, according to a Democratic aide.PARTY UNITY

Trump's Republican critics in Congress said they hoped Trump would work toward party unity, but they would be watching him.""Starting today, I will do everything in my power to hold the President to his promises,"" including fighting to enact term limits and repealing Obamacare, Senator Ben Sasse, who opposed Trump from the start, said in a statement.Repealing Obamacare would shake the U.S. healthcare and insurance industries, which have broadly called for measured reforms, although not for its full-scale elimination.America's Health Insurance Plans, or AHIP, a trade association that represents insurers such as Anthem Inc and Cigna Corp in Washington, said late on Tuesday that it would work with any new administration on the issue.Trump has called Obamacare a ""disaster"" and vowed to repeal and replace it. House Republicans have already voted more than 50 times to repeal all or part of the law.Senate Democrats were certain to fight an Obamacare rollback, but could be outmaneuvered by Republicans at the procedural level with Trump's cooperation.""It would be a tragedy, and I certainly won't in any way cooperate or work with an effort to take health insurance away,"" Senator Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, told CNN. Trump and congressional Republicans will find common ground on taxes. Trump generally sees eye to eye with Republicans in Congress in calling for major tax cuts, including those for the wealthy, although details of their plans are not an exact match.Trump has called for cutting the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 15 percent from the current level of 35 percent; Ryan's tax plan proposes going to 20 percent.Trump has also said he wants to do some things as president, such as ban Muslims from the country and allow torture in the fight against terrorism, that some legal experts say are legally questionable.

By Maurice Tamman and Guy Faulconbridge
| NEW YORK/LONDON

NEW YORK/LONDON Two days ago, pollsters and statisticians gave Hillary Clinton odds of between 75 and 99 percent of winning the U.S. presidential election. How did so many get it so wrong?In hindsight, the polling consensus went astray in two major ways.The media, including Reuters, pumped out two kinds of poll stories. Some were national surveys designed to estimate the entire country's popular vote, but not the outcome in individual states, where the contest is actually decided. These polls actually got the big picture right: Clinton won more overall votes than President-elect Donald Trump - but not by as much as the polling averages predicted, and not where she needed to.News organizations also produced a blizzard of stories meant to calculate the probability of victory for the two candidates. These calculations were predicated on polls of individual states. In hindsight, though, the stories seem to have overstated Clinton's chances for a win by failing to see that a shift in voting patterns in some states could show up in other, similar states. In part, this is because polling analysts got the central metaphor wrong.U.S. presidents are chosen not by the national popular vote, but in the individual Electoral College contests in the 50 states and Washington D.C. In calculating probable outcomes, election predictors generally treated those 51 contests as completely separate events - as unrelated to one another as a series of 51 coin tosses. But that's not how elections work in the United States. Voting trends that appear in one state - such as a larger-than-expected Republican shift among rural voters - tend to show up in other states with similar demographic make-ups. And that's what happened Tuesday: The election models calculated the probabilities of a Clinton win that turned out to be high, because they viewed each state too much in isolation. The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project projected Clinton to win the popular vote 45 percent to 42 percent, and gave her a 90 percent probability of winning the 270 electoral votes needed to secure the election. In the end, Clinton won the popular vote by 47.7 percent to 47.5 percent, by the latest count, and Trump could win the Electoral College by as many as 303 votes to Clinton's 233 when the tally is final.The state races were not akin to a string of coin tosses but more like 51 rolls of a set of weighted dice. In many states, it turned out, the side of the dice representing white voters in suburban and rural counties carried a heavier weight, and the side representing urbanites a lighter one. COMMON MISCALCULATIONS
The problem, said Cliff Young, president of Ipsos Public Affairs US, the polling partner of Reuters, came down to the models the pollsters used to predict who would vote - the so-called likely voters.
The models almost universally miscalculated how turnout was distributed among different demographic groups, Young said. And turnout was lower than expected, a result that generally favors Republican candidates. In 2000, when Republican George W. Bush beat Democrat Al Gore, for example, the turnout was about 60 percent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Eight years later, turnout was 64 percent when Democratic nominee Barack Obama won his first presidential election against Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain.This year, ""whites with lower levels of education came out in greater relative numbers than younger, more-educated and minority voters,"" Young said. ""A point here or a point there can really change an election.""Ultimately, missing that shift in the state polls tripped up the predictions. It also highlights how the otherwise empirical process of polling rests on a subjective foundation.Each pollster must make a decision about turnout. Their decisions are informed by historical voting patterns. But the actual turnout in each state is unknowable before election day.Among the questions pollsters grappled with this year: Will the electorate look like the won that gave Obama his 2008 victory - or George W. Bush in his 2000 victory? Would  black turnout fall after the historically high turnout enjoyed by Obama, the nation's first black president, and by how much? 
""Key for me is turnout in explaining this year's polling miss,"" Young said. The Reuters/Ipsos model anticipated turnout for white men, for example, at around 67 percent, which appears to have been too low, and for black women at 61 percent, which was probably too high. Demographic breakdowns aren't available yet.Drew Linzer, a pollster and creator of the Daily Kos Elections forecasting model, which forecasts the Electoral College result by aggregating large numbers of state polls, said prediction models like his try to estimate the possibility of an unexpected turnout shift. But ultimately, he said, the effectiveness of the models came down to the accuracy of the underlying state polls' likely-voter models. Linzer's model predicted a large win for Clinton in the Electoral College, 323 to 215. And because those polls missed the mark, it created an illusion of a near-certain Clinton win.THE POPULAR VOTE
Beyond the calculations of the candidates' odds of winning the Electoral College, there was a near constant stream so-called ""horse race polls,"" or tracker polls, that focused on the distribution of the national vote between the major candidates.Here, too, pollsters -- and the media that co-sponsored or covered the polls -- stumbled, largely because the popular vote metric itself is of limited utility and cannot, of itself, predict the outcome of the Electoral College.
As of Wednesday morning, Clinton led the popular vote by slightly less than 1 percentage point. The McClatchy-Marist poll released on Nov. 3, for example, had Clinton up by one point - one of the most accurate calls of the popular vote. But even that headline number missed the point a bit, because she lost the election in the Electoral College.A few polls correctly pegged Trump as the winner. The International Business Times/TIPP poll had Trump leading on Nov. 7. That poll put him ahead in the popular vote by two percentage points, which in the end overstated his share by about three points. In one sense, most polls were relatively accurate: The Real Clear Politics average of polls, for example, had Clinton leading by about 3.3 points, little more than two points above the actual outcome. A polling error of two or three percentage points is not uncommon in modern politics.Popular vote polls, however, also exaggerate the influence of massive states, such as New York and California, in the outcome of the election and mask trends that might be occurring outside those left-leaning states. The Electoral College system reduces the influence of big states by distributing a disproportionate number of votes to smaller states. North Dakota, for example, has about a quarter of one percent of the U.S. population but double that proportion of Electoral College votes. Conversely, Californians make up 12 percent of the population but only 10 percent of the Electoral College votes.Young said both pollsters and journalist described the results of the national polls and predictions with a false precision by presenting the result as near absolutes.""The forecasting models, which assign probabilities or chances to candidates, are no better than the polls themselves,"" he said. ""If the polls are off, the forecasting models will be off, too.""The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project website did offer an interactive tool that allowed users to adjust the poll's estimate of turnout and play pollster themselves. It also included one fixed scenario that showed how Trump could win - with a higher-than-expected Republican turnout and a lower-than-forecast Democratic turnout. That scenario, as it happened, better reflected what actually happened Tuesday.""We need to recognize that there can be a range of possibilities,"" said Young. ""The trick of course is how to communicate that with the larger public."" (Edited by Michael Williams)"

By Timothy Aeppel and Daniel Wiessner
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Unions in the United States face sweeping changes to labor law and regulations under a new Republican administration that is expected to tilt policy toward employers.    Republicans will take control of the presidency and both chambers of Congress in Tuesday's elections, after unions failed to deliver key industrial states to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.Clinton's loss could have wide-ranging consequences for unions. Donald Trump and a Republican-led Senate will likely pick the next justice for the Supreme Court, which often hears labor-related cases. ""I think it's going to be a very difficult period,"" said Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, who said he was surprised by the election outcome despite knocking on doors and talking to members in several states. Among his concerns, he listed a Supreme Court case this year in which public-sector unions scored a victory related to funding organized labor - but only because the court deadlocked 4-4. The appointment of a new conservative judge by Trump to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia could change that.Republican nominees will control the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which under Democratic President Barack Obama has sought to make it easier for unions to organize. The NLRB is pursuing litigation to establish that McDonald's Corp is a ""joint employer"" of workers at its franchised restaurants, a determination that could compel the company to bargain with unions representing employees of its independent franchisees. Republicans will control federal agencies that govern the formation of unions, overtime rules and more.
For example, in September the Obama administration finalized an executive order requiring federal contractors to provide sick leave to workers, as well as rules expanding the types of data employers are required to provide on pay. A separate Labor Department rule expanding which employees are eligible for overtime pay is scheduled to take effect next month.Those actions drew criticism from business groups, and all could be reversed under a Trump administration.""We don't have a firewall now,"" said Tom Buffenbarger, a prior president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers who campaigned for Clinton. Trump has expressed support for so-called right-to-work legislation, which allows workers to avoid paying union dues. Republican leaders in Congress have consistently sought such a change at the national level. Labor unions say such laws are aimed at undermining collective bargaining and workers' rights.
William Gould, chair of the NLRB under Democratic President Bill Clinton and now a professor at Stanford Law School, said on Wednesday that Trump was likely to partner with Congress in dismantling a host of administration labor initiatives from Obama. Republicans ""regard unions as first amongst fair game"" because of their support for Clinton, he said.Steven Bernstein, a partner at law firm Fisher Phillips, which represents employers, said the Trump administration and Congress may also target recent NLRB rulings that allowed workers to picket on private property, expanded the type of worker activity protected by federal labor law and gave graduate students the right to unionize.""It's also fair to assume that Trump will be inclined to repeal a host of executive orders supporting unions,"" particularly rules that apply to federal contracts, Bernstein said in a statement.
Organized labor is a key Democratic constituency - contributing everything from volunteers to votes for Democratic candidates. Trump nonetheless carried union-heavy states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio and even Michigan, home to the United Auto Workers (UAW). In Ohio, for example, a Fox exit poll said Trump won 52 percent of union workers. An exit poll from ABC News suggested Clinton got no advantage among union households, even after Obama won those voters by 23 percentage points. (abcn.ws/2eUMxpx) (fxn.ws/2eULxS8)David Lephart, a 58-year-old UAW pipefitter at a General Motors Co plant in Marion, Indiana, voted for Trump. He earns about $100,000 a year, with overtime, he says, and has put both of his kids through college. He said union leaders pressed hard for members to support Clinton, but the union has nOt kept its promises to workers in recent years. ""I don't have a tendency to believe what you tell me -- when you haven't fulfilled the promises you've made,"" he said.UAW President Dennis Williams in a statement on Wednesday said, ""we have high hopes that elected officials heard the American people loud and clear about trade, jobs, education and the inequality in this country.""

By Gabriel Stargardter
| MEXICO CITY

MEXICO CITY Deportations of undocumented Mexican migrants in the United States may start rising when President-elect Donald Trump takes office but the process will not begin soon, Mexico's deputy interior minister for migration said on Wednesday.Trump surged to victory early on Wednesday morning after upsetting pollsters' predictions to beat Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and seize the White House in a campaign that sent the world into uncertainty.The impact of his win was particularly acute in Mexico, where the beleaguered peso currency fell about 10 percent in the aftermath of the vote.
Trump, who will be inaugurated Jan. 20, has vowed to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, fence off Mexico with a border wall and threatened to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement, putting in danger billions of dollars in cross-border trade.""It may well be that deportations of the estimated 6 million undocumented Mexicans increase but we don't think it will be a measure that will take place soon or happen quickly,"" Humberto Roque Villanueva, the deputy interior minister for migration, told Reuters in an interview.
""The Mexicans over there are useful to the North American economy and President Trump, the president-elect, will need to recognize the economic effects of such a campaign promise,"" he said.Roque Villanueva also said Mexico stands ready to lobby the U.S. Congress and use all legal means possible to block Trump's plan for impounding remittances so that Mexico ends up paying for his proposed wall on the southern U.S. border.
""They wouldn't be retaliatory measures. They would be legal responses,"" he said. ""We'll be ready for all the craziness."" (Reporting by Gabriel Stargardter; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Bill Trott)"

By Karen Freifeld and Anthony Lin

Within a few weeks of winning the White House, President-elect Donald Trump could face another group of U.S. citizens, a federal jury in California, courtesy of a lawsuit by former students of his now-defunct Trump University who claim they were defrauded by a series of real-estate seminars.A hearing in federal court in San Diego is set for Thursday, and the trial is scheduled to begin on Nov. 28, barring any delays or if Trump decides to settle the case.   While presidents enjoy immunity from lawsuits arising from their official duties, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that this shield does not extend to acts alleged to have taken place prior to taking office. The 1997 ruling came in the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against President Bill Clinton by Paula Jones, which was settled before it went to trial. Lawyers said they could think of no similar situation like the one now involving Trump.""I'm certain there is nothing comparable to this,"" said    Alan Dershowitz, professor emeritus at Harvard Law School. Lawyers for both Trump and the plaintiffs declined to comment on Wednesday.Dershowitz said the Supreme Court also held that a case cannot be delayed just because the defendant is president, though judges are still free to grant reasonable delays to any party.Miami trial consultant Sandy Marks, who is not involved in the case, said he thought Trump might ask the presiding judge, Gonzalo Curiel, to postpone the trial in an effort to settle the case before taking office.
""I think the judge would be foolhardy not to give him a short (delay),"" said Marks, ""which would give him a chance to resolve the case with all these people and put it behind him.""Trump repeatedly claimed on the campaign trail that he would win the lawsuit, and he accused Curiel of being biased against him because of his campaign promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico. The judge was born in Indiana to Mexican parents.At the hearing on Thursday, lawyers will argue pre-trial motions, including one by Trump to block potential jurors from hearing comments made or publicized during the campaign, such as those about the judge. Lawyers for the students have argued the comments could help jurors assess Trump's credibility as a witness.Trump is listed as defense witness in the case and could be called to testify by the plaintiffs as well. He was previously deposed by the students' lawyers. 
""JURY CONSULTANT'S NIGHTMARE""
Claims against Trump over the seminars date to 2010, with two class actions filed in federal court in San Diego and another case brought by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on behalf of students who claim they were misled into paying as much as $35,000 each to learn worthless real estate investing ""secrets"" from instructors ""hand-picked"" by Trump.Trump has admitted he did not hand-pick instructors, but has argued the claim was marketing language not meant to be taken literally. He claims most students were happy with their courses. 
If the trial goes forward, several legal experts said it would be hard to seat an impartial jury, since so many people already have strong opinions about the president-elect.Parties often hire specialized jury consultants to pick jurors, but New York lawyer Robert Anello said they were not infallible. ""If experienced pollsters can't get it right,"" he said, ""how can a jury consultant who is not spending as much time studying the demographics?""In an interview a day before the election, Jeffrey Goldman, a lawyer for Trump in the New York case, said the media's ""drumbeat of distortion"" about Trump University would make it hard to find impartial jurors.Several experts noted that jurors, who will answer a questionnaire in addition to being questioned by the lawyers and the judge, are generally taken at their word when they say they can be impartial. Boston jury consultant Edward Schwartz said he expects both sides to make an effort to vet jurors by their public social media postings.Dershowitz noted that San Diego, though located in deep-blue California, is not as politically monolithic as, say, San Francisco. It has an ethnically diverse population and also has a large military presence.""This is a jury consultant's nightmare to pick in a case like this,"" said Dershowitz. ""It will be taught in jury consulting school."" (Reporting by Karen Freifeld and Anthony Lin; Editing by Leslie Adler)"

By Luciana Lopez
| MIAMI

MIAMI Latinos angered by Donald Trump's tough stance on immigration could have been the Republican candidate's biggest obstacle on the road to the White House. As it turned out, the brash New York businessman won enough Hispanic votes in Tuesday's election to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton, with some Hispanics who supported him citing everything from ambivalence on immigration to conservative values and job growth.Reuters/Ipsos Election Day polling showed 28 percent of America's Hispanic voters cast ballots for Trump, compared to 66 percent for Clinton, putting him on a par with Republican Mitt Romney's performance with the group in 2012. That outcome helped Trump upset Clinton in the critical battleground state of Florida, where he won 31 percent of Latino voters, while fending off challenges in border states such as Texas and Arizona. Trump's win on Tuesday came as a blow to pro-immigrant advocates who had been hoping that his calls for mass deportations of undocumented foreigners, as well as a massive border wall with Mexico, would drive Latinos to the polls against him in a showcase of rising Hispanic political power.""In our point of view, Latinos did their part to stop Trump,"" said Frank Sharry, executive director of immigrants' rights group America's Voice. But he added: ""There's going to be a lot of finger pointing.""On the streets of Miami overnight Tuesday, celebrations by Latino Trump supporters offered a glimpse of his appeal.""He supports my values,"" said Humberto Quintero, 55, a Venezuelan-American who was among a large crowd celebrating outside Versailles Restaurant in a Cuban neighborhood in Miami, as cars passed honking their horns.He said Trump's promise to restore American manufacturing jobs was also an important issue for him. ""When I was young, everything was made in America,"" Quintero said. ""Now everything is made in China.""He said he also backed Trump's plan for a wall.
""In your house you don't let everybody come inside without your permission,"" he said.Hispanics made up 17.6 of the U.S. population in 2015, up 12 percent from 2012, according to the U.S. Census, making them the country's largest ethnic minority. By 2060, more than one-in-four people in America will be Latino. President Barack Obama won 70 percent of the Latino vote during his 2012 re-election bid while his challenger Romney took 28 percent, the same as Trump this time around.INSULTS HIT A CHORD

Trump's relationship with Hispanic voters started on an awkward footing when he began his campaign in June 2015, calling for tighter borders and accusing Mexico of sending rapists and drug dealers into the United States.He insisted he would force Mexico to pay for a multi-billion-dollar wall along the border to keep unwanted foreigners out of the United States, and vowed to round up and deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country.Those positions, which became a cornerstone of his campaign,  resonated badly on Tuesday with many voters along the U.S. side of the Mexican border.""When he said the Mexicans were rapists and all this, drug dealers and stuff, it did kind of hit a chord,"" said Jazmin Gonzalez, 31, a Mexican-American from the Barrio Logan neighborhood in San Diego who voted for Clinton. ""We know our people.""Miguel Perez, 49, a maintenance engineer in Southern California who came to the United States from Mexico when he was 10, said he also voted for Clinton on Tuesday - mainly just to stop Trump.
""I would have voted for Donald Duck if I had to,"" he said after casting his ballot at San Ysidro High School near the border with Mexico.Clinton had sought to contrast her campaign with Trump's by advocating for a path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants living in the country. She also hired immigrant activists for her campaign and featured undocumented immigrants at rallies.But she and the Democratic Party had at times raised the ire of Latino activists by focusing too heavily on bashing Trump while putting forward less-than-substantive efforts to appeal directly to Latinos, and rejecting pressure to name an Hispanic running mate.Clinton's socially progressive platform, including her support of abortion rights, also may have rankled some religious conservatives within the Hispanic community.Lilian Enriquez, 45, a pastor who voted in Tucson, Arizona, on Tuesday, declined to say who she supported. But she said her vote was based largely on her sense of morality.""The United States is a country that has been cheapened morally, and I do not want to see ... people living a way that goes against the way of God,"" she said.Activist groups wanted to boost turnout among Latinos this year but figures are not yet in. In 2008, less than half of Latinos who were eligible to cast ballots actually did - and the rate dipped in 2012, according to the census. In contrast, the voting rates for white and black voters were both well over 60 percent.

LONDON World leaders offered to work with Donald Trump when he takes over as U.S. president, but expressed anxiety over how he will handle problems from the Middle East to an assertive Russia and whether he will carry out a number of campaign threats.Several authoritarian and right-wing leaders hailed the billionaire businessman and former TV show host, who won the leadership of the world's most powerful country against the odds in Tuesday's election.China, a target of Trump's ire during his campaign, appealed for cooperation. Mexico also struck a conciliatory tone, despite Trump's insults to Mexican migrants and pledges to build a wall to separate the two countries. South Korea urged him not to change policy on North Korea's nuclear tests.Trump, who has no previous political or military experience, said after defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton that he would seek common ground, not conflict, with the United States' allies.In the election campaign, he voiced admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, questioned central tenets of the NATO military alliance and suggested Japan and South Korea should develop nuclear weapons to shoulder their own defense burden.Putin was among the first to send Trump congratulations.Ties between Washington and Moscow have become strained over the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, and allegations of Russian cyber attacks featured in the election campaign.""It is not an easy path, but we are ready to do our part and do everything to return Russian and American relations to a stable path of development,"" said Putin, for whom an easing of U.S. economic sanctions would be a prize.Among other issues causing concern among allies are Trump's vows to undo a global agreement on climate change, ditch trade deals he says have been bad for U.S. workers, and renegotiate the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers which has led to an easing of sanctions on Iran.Iran urged Trump to stay committed to the Iran deal. President Hassan Rouhani said the nuclear accord with six world powers could not be dismissed by one government.UNCERTAINTY
German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- denounced by Trump as ""insane"" for allowing more than 1 million migrants into the country last year -- added a stern note in her message of congratulations which hinted at a certain unease.""Germany and America are bound together by values - democracy, freedom, respecting the rule of law, people's dignity regardless of their origin, the color of their skin, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views,"" Merkel said.
""On the basis of these values, I am offering to work closely with the future President of the United States Donald Trump.""In Britain, where Trump's victory had echoes of June's referendum in which voters showed dissatisfaction with the political establishment by voting to leave the European Union, Prime Minister Theresa May said the ""enduring and special relationship"" between the two countries would remain intact.But Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, who has often expressed distaste for Trump, said many people in the United States and across the world would feel ""a real sense of anxiety.""Nigel Farage, a leader of the Brexit campaign who spoke at a Trump rally during the election campaign, tweeted: ""I hand over the mantle to @RealDonaldTrump! Many congratulations. You have fought a brave campaign.""Some European officials however took the unusual step of openly denouncing the outcome, calling it a worrying signal for liberal democracy and tolerance in the world.""We're realizing now that we have no idea what this American president will do,"" Norbert Roettgen, the head of the German parliament's foreign affairs committee, said.President Francois Hollande said France wanted to begin talks with Trump immediately to clarify his stance on  international affairs.""This American election opens a period of uncertainty,"" Hollande said.
French officials had endorsed Clinton and warned that Trump's ""confused"" foreign policy objectives were alarming for the rest of the world.""The U.S. is a vital partner for France and what's at stake is peace, the fight against terrorism, the situation in the Middle East, economic relations and the preservation of the planet,"" Hollande said.But like-minded right-wing European parties that are hoping to make inroads of their own in 2017 -- a year in which Germany, France and the Netherlands hold elections, and Italy and Britain could also do so -- hailed Trump's victory. France's far-right National Front leader, Marine Le Pen, said she hoped the same kind of upset would happen in France.""The Americans gave themselves a president of their choosing and not the one that the establishment wanted them to rubber-stamp,"" she said. PARTNERS AND ALLIES

Mexican President Pena Nieto, who was criticized for receiving Trump in Mexico during the campaign, said he was ready to work with the president-elect.""Mexico and the United States are friends, partners and allies and we should keep collaborating for the competitiveness and development of North America,"" Pena Nieto said.Trump has said he could tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), saying that it has killed U.S. jobs, and he called Mexican immigrants rapists during his campaign.Sounding conciliatory, Chinese President Xi Jinping said Beijing and Washington shared responsibility for promoting global development and prosperity.""I place great importance on the China-U.S. relationship, and look forward to working with you to uphold the principles of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation,"" Xi told Trump, who had pledged to take on China and to tax Chinese imports to stop currency devaluation.South Korea expressed the hope that Trump would maintain current U.S. policy of pressuring North Korea over its nuclear and missile tests. Seoul was concerned Trump may make unpredictable proposals to North Korea, a ruling party official said, quoting top national security officials.A Japanese government official, speaking before Trump clinched the election, urged him to send a message as soon as possible to reassure the world of the United States' commitment to its allies.""We are certainly concerned about the comments (Trump) has made to date about the alliance and the U.S. role in the Pacific, particularly Japan,"" the Japanese official said. In the Middle East, Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu, who had a poor relationship with President Barack Obama, said he hoped to reach ""new heights"" in bilateral ties under Trump.Obama and Netanyahu sparred over the issue of Israeli  settlements, while Trump has said they should expand.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas also congratulated Trump, but analysts said his rule may be profoundly negative for Palestinian aspirations.And despite Trump's negative rhetoric about Muslims during his campaign, including threats to ban them from the United States, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said he hoped the business magnate's election would breathe new life into U.S.-Egyptian ties.

By Karen Pierog

Republicans will continue to dominate state legislatures in the wake of Tuesday's election, which kept their party in control of Congress and put Donald Trump in the White House, legislative analysts said on Wednesday.After an election in which more than 80 percent of 7,383 state legislative seats nationwide were up for grabs, Republicans and Democrats were likely to control the same number of chambers they had previously, according to the bipartisan National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), which is still compiling voting results.Republicans, who have dominated control of legislatures since the 2010 mid-term election, held the majority in 67 of the country's 98 partisan legislative chambers, while Democrats had 31 going into the election. Nebraska's single chamber is nonpartisan.""Neither party can sort of boast of having a big night down on the state level,"" NCSL elections analyst Tim Storey said. ""Republicans will remain in a dominant position in terms of policy making.""In Kentucky, Republicans took over the House of Representatives for the first time since 1921, while defeating longtime Democratic House Speaker Greg Stumbo, according to the Republican Legislative Campaign Committee.
That result leaves Republicans in control of all 30 legislative chambers in the U.S. South for the first time in history, Storey said.Republicans also wrested control of the Iowa Senate and the Minnesota Senate from Democrats, according to NCSL.Democrats hit their target in the New Mexico House of Representatives, gaining a majority of seats, and took over both chambers of the Nevada Legislature.
In Hawaii, the only Republican in the Senate was ousted, making the Democratic-controlled chamber the first all one-party state legislative chamber since 1980. One chamber, the Connecticut Senate, came out of the election tied.Democrats retained control of the Illinois Legislature but lost their veto-proof majority in the House after Republican Governor Bruce Rauner and his top donors invested tens of millions of dollars in a bid to weaken long-serving Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan.
The control of the New York Senate was still undetermined, NCSL said.Missouri's legislature and governor's office will be totally under Republican control after Eric Greitens won the race to succeed term-limited Democratic Governor Jay Nixon. Vermont will be split with the election of Republican Phil Scott as governor.Republicans extended their majority of U.S. governorships in Tuesday's vote.
