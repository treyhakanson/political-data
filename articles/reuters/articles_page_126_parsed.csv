By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican rival Donald Trump by 12 percentage points among likely voters, her strongest showing this month, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday.The Aug. 18-22 poll showed that 45 percent of voters supported Clinton, while 33 percent backed Trump ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Clinton, the former U.S. secretary of state, has led Trump, a New York businessman, throughout most of the 2016 campaign. But her latest lead represents a stronger level of support than polls indicated over the past few weeks. Earlier in August, Clinton's lead over Trump ranged from 3 to 9 percentage points in the poll. 
The poll also found that about 22 percent of likely voters would not pick either candidate. That lack of support is high compared with how people responded to the poll during the 2012 presidential election between Democratic President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney.""Those who are wavering right now are just as likely to be thinking about supporting a third-party candidate instead, and not between Clinton and Trump,"" said Tom Smith, who directs the Center for the Study of Politics and Society at the University of Chicago.
During the latest polling, Clinton faced renewed scrutiny about her handling of classified emails while serving as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, and Trump's campaign chief, Paul Manafort, resigned after a reshuffle of the candidate's campaign leadership team.      Clinton held a smaller lead in a separate four-way poll that included Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party. Among likely voters, 41 percent supported Clinton, while 33 percent backed Trump. Johnson was backed by 7 percent and Stein by 2 percent.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. Both presidential polls included 1,115 respondents and had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.  (Editing by Peter Cooney)"	['Romney', 'Paul', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

By Keith Coffman
| DENVER

DENVER Kansas on Tuesday asked a U.S. appeals court to reinstate rules requiring proof of U.S. citizenship from people registering to vote, the latest political battle over stringent identification laws enacted in Republican-led states ahead of the 2016 presidential election.The mandate that Kansans present passports, birth certificates or other proof of citizenship when registering to vote while obtaining driver's licenses was challenged by a U.S. District Court judge in May.Her ruling restored the right to vote in the Nov. 8 election for thousands of people who were asked if they wanted to register while at motor vehicle offices, but not required to submit the additional documentation. Judge Julie Robinson ordered those people to be re-registered. She said that Kansas could identify only three non-citizens who voted between 2003 and the onset of the law in 2013.Kansas' law is one of the strictest voter identification statutes in the country, making the state a symbol for mostly Republican Party supporters who say the rules are meant to prevent voter fraud. Opponents, mostly Democrats, say they discriminate against minorities.""Every time a noncitizen votes, it effectively cancels out the vote of a citizen,"" Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach said in court filings ahead of Tuesday's oral arguments.
In arguments before the Denver-based U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, Kobach said, ""We don't need to be authorized by the federal government"" to set up rules to manage state and local elections.Arguing for the lower court's decision to be upheld, the American Civil Liberties Union specifically targeted a portion of Kansas law that deals with people who register to vote at motor vehicle department offices.The ACLU argued that the requirement conflicts with a federal law from 1993 aimed at making it easier for people to register to vote by doing so when they apply for a driver's license.
 Because that law does not require people to bring more documentation than they would need to get a driver's license, Robinson ruled that about 18,000 people whose registration had been invalidated by the state should be re-registered.Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump, who earlier this month said that voters who opposed his candidacy are ""going to vote 10 times,"" is asking supporters to volunteer to be election observers at the polls. He routinely calls Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton ""crooked"" and has said that if he loses, it will be because the system is rigged against him.
Led by lawyers from the ACLU, opponents of the voter identification laws have filed lawsuits in several states, successfully overturning or delaying implementation of some statutes. Last month, a federal judge in Wisconsin ruled that voters who do not have photo identification will be able to vote in the  presidential election, and the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a North Carolina law requiring voters to bring a photo ID to the polls.Seventeen states have put new voting restrictions in place since the last presidential contest, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law.

By Dave McKinney and Karen Pierog
| CHICAGO

CHICAGO Potential action this week by Illinois' biggest public pension fund could put a big dent in the state's already fragile finances, Governor Bruce Rauner's administration warned.A Monday memo from a top Rauner aide said the Teachers' Retirement System (TRS) board could decide at its meeting this week to lower the assumed investment return rate, a move that would automatically boost Illinois' annual pension payment. ""If the (TRS) board were to approve a lower assumed rate of return taxpayers will be automatically and immediately on the hook for potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in higher taxes or reduced services,"" Michael Mahoney, Rauner's senior advisor for revenue and pensions, wrote to the governor's chief of staff, Richard Goldberg.When TRS lowered the investment return rate to 7.5 percent from 8 percent in 2014 the state's pension payment increased by more than $200 million, according to the memo. Illinois' fiscal 2017 pension payment to its five retirement systems was estimated at $7.9 billion, up from $7.617 billion in fiscal 2016 and $6.9 billion in fiscal 2015, according to a March report by a bipartisan legislative commission.
The country's fifth-largest state's unfunded pension liability stood at $111 billion at the end of fiscal 2015, with TRS accounting for more than 55 percent of that gap. The funded ratio was a weak 41.9 percent.An impasse between the Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature left Illinois as the only state without a complete 2016 budget. A six-month fiscal 2017 spending plan was passed in June.
Mahoney cautioned that ""unforeseen and unknown automatic cost increases would have a devastating impact"" on Illinois' ability to fund social services and education.One of Rauner's top Republican legislative allies, Senate Minority Leader Christine Radogno, urged the TRS board to delay a vote Friday to give the public time to weigh in on its possible actions.""This issue is important enough at the very least to put the TRS board on notice we don't want them taking any action that could cost taxpayers $200 to $300 million without appropriate scrutiny,"" she said.
TRS spokesman Dave Urbanek said the pension system was not aware of Mahoney's memo until Tuesday and that Rauner's office had requested ""information about the scenarios under consideration.""He added TRS did not offer ""potential scenarios"" either to the governor's office or legislative leaders and noted the TRS board has not yet discussed the matter.

By Amanda Becker
| LOS ANGELES

LOS ANGELES Democrat Hillary Clinton on Tuesday vowed to make starting a small business in the United States as easy as opening a lemonade stand if elected president, targeting a large economic sector and a significant voting bloc. Her flagship proposal is to establish a standard tax deduction for small businesses, previously only available to individuals, allowing owners to get tax relief without filing additional forms. Clinton would also expand healthcare tax credits in the Affordable Care Act for small businesses that employ up to 50 workers and create new federal incentives for local and state governments to streamline the business licensing process, according to background provided by her campaign.Since launching her campaign in April 2015, Clinton has said she wants to be the ""small business president"" if she wins the Nov. 8 election against businessman Donald Trump, the Republican nominee.Trump has offered lower tax rates for small businesses and cuts to federal regulations to help ""jump-start America.""
Clinton's campaign held a conference call with small business owners on Tuesday to discuss her proposals and offer ways they could help with the former secretary of state's campaign.""You will always have a seat at the table,"" Clinton told business owners on the call, taking questions from entrepreneurs in Virginia and Michigan.Small businesses play a vital economic role in the United States, making up 99.7 percent of U.S. employer firms and providing 49.2 percent of U.S. private-sector jobs, according to the Small Business Administration. 
The proposals announced by Clinton's campaign on Tuesday fill in details on how the Democratic nominee would fulfill promises to improve access to financing and minimize regulatory burdens that make it difficult to start small businesses.""They tell me more dreams die in the parking lots of banks than anywhere in America,"" Clinton said of the feedback she has received from small business owners.
""I'd like to get rid of the unnecessary red tape,"" Clinton said of regulations on credit unions and small banks that make it difficult to lend to would-be entrepreneurs. Clinton's campaign said she also wants to guarantee that small businesses with questions about U.S. government regulations receive an answer within 24 hours.Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, discussed the new proposals during a Tuesday roundtable with small business owners in Colorado, a battleground state.

AUSTIN, Texas Texas and four other states sued the Obama administration on Tuesday over extending its healthcare nondiscrimination law to transgender individuals, saying the move ""represents a radical invasion of the federal bureaucracy into a doctor's medical judgment.""Texas, along with Wisconsin, Nebraska, Kentucky and Kansas sued on behalf three medical organizations, two of which are affiliated with Christian groups. They argue the medical groups would be forced to violate their religious beliefs ""and perform harmful medical transition procedures or else suffer massive financial liability,"" according to the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, named as a defendant in the suit, was not immediately available for comment.
On Sunday, a judge for the same district blocked an Obama administration policy that public schools should allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice, granting a nationwide injunction sought by 13 states, led by Texas.The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, was passed in 2010 and included anti-discrimination provisions to prevent insurers from charging customers more or denying coverage based on age or sex.
That law left some areas open to interpretation and thousands of consumers complain each year about being discriminated against, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said last year.
The U.S. government said in September it would broaden its nondiscrimination law to transgender individuals and require health insurers and medical providers to treat all patients equally, regardless of sex. (Reporting by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Bill Rigby)"	['Obama']	['healthcare']

By Ginger Gibson and Emily Stephenson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON After struggling to find a consistent message and consolidate party support, Donald Trump is honing his attack on Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton and the foundation bearing her family's name in hopes of making it a rallying cry for fellow Republicans.Trump began hammering the Democrat this week over the Clinton Foundation, an organization created by her and her husband former President Bill Clinton that funds aid programs in developing countries. On Monday, Trump called for the foundation to be shut down and for a special prosecutor to be named to investigate it. In particular, he accused Clinton of having turned the charity into a ""pay-for-play"" scheme in which wealthy donors to the organization got favors from the State Department while Clinton was secretary of state from 2009-2013. The Clinton campaign denied that, saying Clinton never took any action because of donations to the foundation.After a primary campaign that left the party bitterly divided, Trump has struggled to find an attack line that fellow Republicans can rally behind. His criticism of the parents of a dead Muslim American soldier who spoke at the Democratic National Convention drew strong rebukes from many in his own party. His attacks on Clinton's health have been dismissed as conspiracy theories. Clinton, who leads in nearly every national and swing state opinion poll ahead of the Nov. 8 election, has largely avoided criticism about the foundation, although there was a spate of media investigations last year after she announced she was running for president. Her main Democratic rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, did not attack her on that front during the primary campaign.The focus on the foundation is likely to build some confidence among Republicans that Trump's campaign is healing internal divisions. Last week, Trump shook up his campaign's top leadership, putting Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway in top jobs. Campaign chairman Paul Manafort resigned.Chris Collins, a Republican member of Congress, said supporters have been urging Trump to focus on Clinton. 
""Anything we can do to put her character forefront in the campaign is going to help Donald Trump,"" Collins said in a phone interview.Republican Chairman Reince Preibus said if Trump continues  to remain ""measured,"" he could be ""tied or ahead"" in the polls by the first week in September. Recent Reuters/Ipsos opinion polls have found Clinton increasing her lead over Trump during August. The latest poll, on Monday, showed Clinton at 45 percent, and Trump at 33 percent.'ABSURD CALL'

Clinton's campaign has pushed back at the attack. Clinton spokesman Robby Mook said the foundation will not shut down given its humanitarian work, and he did not see it hurting Clinton's lead in polls.""This is an absurd call by Donald Trump. It is an act of desperation on his campaign given the turmoil that we've seen from his campaign in recent weeks,"" he told MSNBC.Trump abandoned plans to deliver a policy speech on Thursday about immigration. The postponement came as signs of internal disagreement on his immigration policy became public, but the move also allowed him to focus on what he and his advisers see as a Clinton weakness. The foundation has long been a potential liability for Clinton. The fact it accepted corporate and foreign donations sparked criticism that it represented a conflict of interest while Clinton was secretary of state. On Sunday, the foundation announced it would no longer accept foreign donations if Clinton is elected and that the group is prepared to hand off programs to other charity organizations.
Democrats are hopeful Trump is making an issue of the foundation too late for it to make a difference. Most American voters already have an opinion of Hillary Clinton, said Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist who once worked for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. ""The views are pretty hardened on both sides, and I don't think anything is going to move that needle,"" he said.Both Clinton and Trump have unusually high ""unfavorable"" ratings among voters, although Trump currently scores worse on that score, opinion polls show. The dual controversies over the foundation and over Clinton's use of a private server and email account while secretary of state dovetailed on Monday. Conservative legal group Judicial Watch sought to make the case that previously unreleased emails provide evidence that Clinton offered access to donors to the foundation while she was secretary of state.

A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld an Ohio law passed in 2014 that shortened the state's early voting period and abolished a so-called Golden Week when residents could register and cast ballots in the same week.The 2-1 decision from a panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reverses a May ruling by U.S. District Judge Michael Watson who struck down the law that limited early voting, saying it violated voters' rights.Tuesday's ruling is the latest in a flurry of legal battles over state voting rules ahead of the Nov. 8 election, including stricter voter identification laws in some states and laws on the voting rights of felons in others. . Ohio has long been a battleground swing state in presidential elections where Democrats and Republicans are tightly matched.Ohio's Republican-controlled legislature abolished ""Golden Week"" and shortened early voting to 29 days from 35 days, which critics said directly limited opportunities for minority participation in elections.
Civil rights groups the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People had challenged the law, but their arguments were not accepted by the majority opinion at the appeals court.
In the ruling on an appeal filed by the state government the judges said Ohio is a national leader when it comes to early voting, allowing people to vote early and in person for four weeks. ""This is really quite generous,"" the ruling said.The ruling said the challenged law does not result in injury under the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act and that despite the changes, ""Ohio continues to provide generous, reasonable, and accessible voting options to all Ohioans.""

By Jeff Mason and Gederts Gelzis
| RIGA

RIGA U.S. Vice President Joe Biden told Baltic leaders on Tuesday not to take seriously comments by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump that called into question the U.S. commitment to protect NATO allies in the face of Russian aggression.On a trip to Latvia, Biden suggested Trump, who has never held elected office, did not understand NATO's mutual defense guarantee, known as Article Five.""I want to make it absolutely clear to all the people in Baltic states: we have pledged our sacred honor, the United States of America ... to the NATO treaty and Article Five,"" Biden, a Democrat, said in the Latvian capital.""The fact that you occasionally hear something from a presidential candidate in the other party, it's ... nothing that should be taken seriously,"" Biden said.Biden's visit comes amid heightened tensions with Russia in the region and some nervousness among allies about Trump, who has suggested he might abandon NATO's pledge to defend all alliance members automatically if elected.
Both Democrats and Republicans supported the NATO pledge, said Biden, who made his remarks during an appearance with the leaders of all three Baltic states in Riga.""There is continued overwhelming bipartisan commitment in the United States of America in both political parties to maintain our commitment to NATO,"" he said.Trump is running against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who has also affirmed her commitment to NATO. Clinton is ahead in polls.  
Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, the three Baltic states which regained independence in the early 1990s a half century after being annexed by the Soviet Union, see themselves on the frontline of any potential conflict with Russia.NATO leaders agreed last month to deploy military forces to the Baltic states and eastern Poland for the first time and increase air and sea patrols to reassure allies in the region worried about the threat from Moscow.
""It is important for us that we are ready, all parties, to confirm our strategic partnership ... and we are sure that no matter what changes will be after the elections in (the) United States, their commitments ... to NATO, to (the) Baltic region, will stay,"" said Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite, speaking after Biden.   Russia often depicts NATO as an aggressor whose members are moving troops and military hardware further into former Soviet territory, which it regards as its sphere of influence.On Wednesday, Biden travels to Turkey where he will meet President Tayyip Erdogan and Prime Minister Binali Yildirim before visiting Sweden to discuss Europe's asylum crisis.

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. budget deficit is expected to grow to $590 billion in fiscal year 2016 due to slower than expected growth in revenues and higher spending for programs including Social Security and Medicare, the Congressional Budget Office said on Tuesday.The estimate, which is $56 billion larger than CBO's forecast in March, shows the deficit increasing in relation to economic output for the first time since 2009. CBO said the deficit is expected to be $152 billion higher than in 2015 and will equal 3.2 percent of economic output.The deficit peaked at $1.4 trillion in 2009 and shrank to $485 billion in 2014.
The nonpartisan research agency also said that debt held by the public will amount to nearly 77 percent of gross domestic product by the end of 2016, three percentage points higher than last year and its highest ratio since 1950.The 2016 federal fiscal year ends Sept. 30.
Revenues have increased by less than 1 percent in 2016, while government outlays are predicted to rise by 5 percent as a result of mandatory spending for Social Security and Medicare, the federal retirement and healthcare programs for the elderly.   The CBO said the forecast indicates tepid U.S. economic growth of only 1 percent for the first half of calendar year 2016 but predicted the economy would expand more robustly in coming months and create growth of 2 percent for the year and 2.4 percent for 2017. Faster growth will spur hiring, increase wages and put upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. 
But over the next 10 years, CBO said economic output would be restrained by a relatively slow increase in the U.S. labor supply. (Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Alistair Bell)"	[]	['healthcare']

By Kim Palmer and Susan Cornwell
| COLUMBUS, Ohio/WASHINGTON

COLUMBUS, Ohio/WASHINGTON Rob Portman is largely ignoring Donald Trump, which is hard to do in U.S. politics today, but the strategy seems to be working for the Republican senator in his re-election bid in Ohio.As congressional Republicans across the country grapple with the Trump effect on their home-state campaigns, the mild-mannered Portman, 60, may be pointing the way forward in his race, the nation's most expensive Senate contest so far this year.Last week in Columbus, the state capital, Portman made no mention of Trump in a campaign appearance, though the New York businessman is the Republican presidential nominee and Portman has endorsed him.On Portman's web site, Trump is absent. Portman has hit the campaign trail in Ohio with a Republican who had White House ambitions, but it's the state's Governor John Kasich, not Trump.Kasich lost his bid for the party's nomination to Trump. Since then, Kasich pointedly has not endorsed Trump, a property developer and television personality who has never held elected office and whose smash-mouth politics worries many Republicans who fear he may lose them votes in Senate and House of Representatives races.Those concerns have been compounded by Trump falling behind his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in opinion polls.Portman campaign manager Corey Bliss said his boss has never wavered in his support of Trump and there has been no conscious effort to de-couple Portman from the presidential nominee. 
But a story on the Cleveland.com web site last week reported that Portman, a veteran Washington insider, has yet to appear at a single Trump campaign event, or even in the same photo, with  him.While effectively disconnecting himself from his party's nominee, Portman has led Democratic rival Ted Strickland by five to nine points in various polls since late July. Strickland is a 75-year-old ex-governor of the Midwestern swing state.A Monmouth University Poll on Monday gave Portman a lead of 48 percent to 40 percent over Strickland, while Clinton had 43 percent of likely Ohio voters and Trump had 39 percent.
Portman does not view either presidential nominee as crucial to the Ohio election, Bliss said. ""We are focused on our race and running for U.S. Senate,"" he said. BIG DOLLAR RACE
With the Nov. 8 elections nearing rapidly, the Ohio race is the costliest U.S. Senate show-down in 2016. Candidates, parties and outside groups have spent $45 million, said the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog group.
Portman worked briefly for former President George H.W. Bush, then was elected to the House. He resigned to be U.S. trade representative in 2005-2006, then director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget for President George W. Bush. Strickland, a former Ohio governor, previously represented southeastern Ohio in Congress for 12 years. That region of the state could play a role in the Portman-Strickland fight, but Trump himself is a major factor.Paul Beck, a political science professor emeritus at Ohio State University, said despite distancing himself from Trump, Portman could still be hurt if Republicans are so turned off by the presidential nominee that they decide not to vote at all.""These are real worries, and it's a challenge to Republican candidates all over the country, but particularly to Rob Portman,"" Beck said.
