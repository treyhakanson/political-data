By Mark Hosenball
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A U.S congressional intelligence committee on Thursday issued a scathing report accusing former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden of leaking information that ""caused tremendous damage"" to U.S. national security, lying about his background and feuding with co-workers.In a report endorsed by both its Republican and Democratic leaders, the House intelligence committee said Snowden was ""not a whistleblower"" as he has claimed. Most of the material he stole from the NSA was not about invasions of privacy, but revealed intelligence and defense programs of great interest to America's foreign adversaries, it said.The committee said that while the ""full scope"" of damage caused by Snowden's disclosures remains unknown, a review of materials he allegedly compromised ""makes clear that he handed over secrets that protect American troops overseas and secrets that provide vital defenses against terrorists and nation-states.""    The committee released only a four-page summary of what it said was a 36-page investigative report that remains Top Secret, but the summary contained strong words about Snowden's actions and background.The report contains previously unreported allegations about Snowden and his possible motives for taking government secrets. It alleges that Snowden, who took refuge in Moscow after fleeing to Hong Kong, ""was and remains a serial exaggerator and fabricator.""
It says his official employment records show that while he claimed to have left U.S. Army basic training because of broken legs, in fact he ""washed out because of shin splits."" The report says Snowden claimed to have obtained a high-school graduation equivalent, but in fact never did.It also says he claimed to have worked as a ""senior advisor"" for the CIA when in fact he was an entry-level computer technician.While the report says Snowden ""stole 1.5 million sensitive documents,"" other sources who have examined materials he turned over to media outlets say that the total is between 200,000 and 300,000 documents. 
Some U.S. officials involved in Snowden-related investigations acknowledge that the U.S. government does not know how many documents Snowden downloaded, and that the 1.5 million figure is an estimate.    The report also disputes Snowden's motives for taking and leaking classified information, saying he got into a ""workplace spat"" with NSA managers in June 2012 over how to manage computer updates. It says a contracting officer reprimanded him for failing to follow proper grievance procedures, and he began downloading classified information two weeks later.However, in 2013, Reuters quoted U.S. officials and other sources familiar with the matter as saying that Snowden began downloading such data in April 2012, almost a year earlier than had previously been reported at the time.
The issuance of the House committee report coincided with the release of ""Snowden"", a movie directed by Oliver Stone that portrays him as a whistleblower and hero. On Wednesday, prominent human rights advocates urged President Barack Obama to pardon Snowden before leaving office in January.U.S. officials have said Obama is not considering a pardon for Snowden, who is facing U.S. criminal charges for providing classified information to unauthorized persons.Ben Wizner, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union who represents Snowden, dismissed the House committee report as lacking substance. Wizner said the report's release a day before the Snowden film opens ""is evidence that people in the intelligence community are taking us seriously, that they are concerned that Oliver Stone's movie will help solidify Snowden's image as a true patriot, which he is.""

By Amanda Becker
| GREENSBORO, N.C.

GREENSBORO, N.C. Hillary Clinton got back on the campaign trail on Thursday after taking three days off for pneumonia, and the Democratic presidential candidate faced a more challenging political landscape, with Republican rival Donald Trump rising in opinion polls.Senior Clinton aides said they always expected the race to the Nov. 8 election to be close. But it was clear from a raft of new polls that Trump had halted a summer swoon after taking steps to give a less freewheeling, more polished performance on the stump.Clinton, 68, appeared in good health on a visit to her campaign plane's press cabin while flying to Greensboro, North Carolina, for a rally where she sought to refocus her campaign on the plight of the working class - which has turned out to be a potent theme for Trump.Leaving the stage to the tune of James Brown's ""I feel good,"" Clinton told reporters she kept her pneumonia diagnosis last Friday quiet, telling only senior staff, because she thought she would be able to ""power through"" the illness and keep campaigning.""From my perspective, I thought I was going to be fine and I thought that there was no reason to make a big fuss about it,"" she said.On Sunday, Clinton nearly collapsed while leaving a ceremony marking the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York.Her illness coincided with a mini-surge by Trump, who has drawn even or taken a slight lead in national polls. Polls in battleground states where the race is likely to be decided showed Trump now leading in Iowa, Ohio, Florida and Nevada, and tied in North Carolina.Following her appearance in North Carolina, Clinton was scheduled to appear at a Washington dinner.Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, said the candidate and her aides expected the contest to be close.
""We always expected the race to tighten up, we still feel like we're in a strong position with organizational advantage in Florida and Ohio,"" Podesta told reporters on Thursday. ""They call these states battlegrounds for a reason.""In a speech at the New York Economic Club, Trump stuck to his script, avoiding the more improvisational style that has produced a cornucopia of controversies.Trump pushed a package of tax cuts he said would help power the U.S. economy to an annual growth rate of 3.5 percent.The New York businessman said his goal would be 4 percent growth, a target originally championed by Republican primary rival Jeb Bush. Trump said the growth would generate 25 million new jobs.His economic package resurrected a decades-old debate on whether tax cuts can generate sustainable growth. But the overarching impression left by his speech was one of Trump talking about substantive issues and avoiding the frivolous.
Bob Shrum, a Democratic strategist who managed 2004 candidate John Kerry's unsuccessful campaign, said Clinton remained the favorite to win the White House, with demographic changes favoring her over Trump, who is heavily reliant on white voters.What has hurt Clinton, Shrum said, is not the time taken off from the campaign trail but rather her decision to keep her diagnosis secret until forced to disclose it - which reinforced a perception among voters that she has a penchant for secrecy.""Fairly or unfairly, what this was taken as was more evidence that she was not transparent and that's what hurts her,"" Shrum said. ""She been far more transparent than Trump but she hasn't gotten any credit for it.""Democrats have sought to pressure Trump to release his tax returns, but the Republican has said he will not release them until a federal government audit has been completed. Clinton has released her tax records.With the candidates' health in the spotlight, Trump, 70, on Thursday released details of a recent physical examination, a day after Clinton released specifics on her medical condition.
Trump's campaign said the results of his physical showed the fast-food fan has normal cholesterol with the help of a statin drug, weighs 236 pounds (107 kg) and has normal blood pressure.In a not-so-subtle slap at Clinton, the Trump campaign said his medical report showed he ""has the stamina to endure -- uninterrupted -- the rigors of a punishing and unprecedented presidential campaign and, more importantly, the singularly demanding job of president of the United States.""Trump also appeared on the ""Dr. Oz Show"" to discuss his health in an interview with host Mehmet Oz, a surgeon.Top Clinton aide Jennifer Palmieri said ""one upside"" of Clinton's unplanned break was the chance to ""sharpen the final argument Clinton will present to voters in these closing weeks.""""Our campaign readily admits that running against a candidate as controversial as Donald Trump means it is harder to be heard on what you aspire for the country's future, and it is incumbent on us to work harder,"" Palmieri said in a statement.Trump backers on Capitol Hill said they were heartened by the tightening race after a call on Thursday morning with his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, who mapped out what the campaign was doing. She promised a more policy-driven approach from Trump in the race's final stretch.""The poll numbers are just looking phenomenal as you move away from registered voters to likely voters,"" Republican U.S. Representative Blake Farenthold of Texas said.

By Jeff Mason
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, one of the leaders of the ""birther"" movement that questioned President Barack Obama's U.S. citizenship, believes Obama was born in the United States, the Trump campaign said in a statement on Thursday.In an interview with the Washington Post released earlier in the day, Trump declined to say whether he believed Obama was born in Hawaii.""I'll answer that question at the right time. I just don't want to answer it yet,"" Trump told the newspaper.Those comments drew criticism from Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who expressed dismay at Trump's response during remarks to a gathering of Hispanic leaders in Washington.
""He still wouldn't say Hawaii. He still wouldn't say America. This man wants to be our next president?"" Clinton said. ""When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry? Now he's tried to reset himself and his campaign many times. This is the best he can do. This is who he is,"" she said.
A few years into his presidency, Obama, the first African American to win the White House, released a longer version of his birth certificate to answer those who suggested he was not U.S. born.""In 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate,"" Trump senior communications advisor Jason Miller said in a statement late on Thursday.
""Having successfully obtained President Obama's birth certificate when others could not, Mr. Trump believes that President Obama was born in the United States,"" he said.Trump has been trying to drum up support among black voters, who overwhelmingly supported Obama in his 2008 and 2012 elections. Many African Americans object to Trump's involvement in the ""birther"" movement and the implication that Obama's presidency was illegitimate.

By Chris Prentice
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday appeared to weigh into a debate over a controversial U.S. biofuels program with a proposal that would back the position of billionaire investor Carl Icahn, one of his wealthiest backers.In a factsheet on economic policy, the Trump campaign slammed a system of buying and selling biofuel blending credits that it said was bankrupting smaller oil refiners. The system is a central part of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), the federal program that requires fuel sold in the United States to contain a minimum volume of biofuels, such as ethanol.The comments were later removed from the Trump campaign website. A Trump spokesman said an incorrect version of the factsheet was temporarily placed online. He said Trump remains committed to the Renewable Fuel Standard.It was unclear whether the comments reflected a changed stance from Trump on the country's more than decade-old RFS program, which he has previously voiced support for.
But they echoed the position of Icahn, who recently called on federal regulators to level the playing field in the credits system to favor independent refiners like CVR Energy Inc (CVI.N), in which Icahn is the majority shareholder.Icahn's office did not return an email and call when asked to comment.""These regulations will give Big Oil an oligopoly by destroying the small to mid-size refineries,"" the factsheet on Trump's economic policies said.
""These requirements have turned out to be impossible to meet and are bankrupting many of the small and midsize refineries in this country,"" it added.   The comments underscored a growing schism within the oil sector pitting large oil companies against independent oil refiners. It also touches on a debate between the interests of Big oil and Big Corn, which strongly backs the mandated use of ethanol in fuels and the credit system to make it work. The RFS has hurt independent refiners, who do not always have the ability to mix biofuels into their gasoline and diesel before they send it to gas stations. To sell their gasoline without the required biofuel content, they have to buy credits from oil companies that have blended the fuels.
Those credits have cost the companies billions of dollars, and 2016 looks set to be the most expensive on record to buy the credits, known as RINs.Philadelphia Energy Solutions Inc (PESC.N) said last week that it plans to slash benefits and reduce staff, citing the high cost of buying RINs as one of the principal reasons it needed to make the cuts.Independent refiners are pressing environmental regulators for changes to the program that could increase the amount of credits the larger companies need, industry sources have said.For its part, Big Oil favors a repeal of the whole program, rather than a tweak that may land it with increased costs. Biofuels advocates also are against a change to the program. (Reporting by Chris Prentice,; additional reporting by Emily Stephenson and Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Simon Webb and Andrew Hay)"

By Amanda Becker
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Donald Trump Jr. sought on Thursday to clarify his remark that the media would be ""warming up the gas chamber"" if the Republican Party behaved the same way as the Democrats during the U.S. presidential campaign, saying it was a reference to capital punishment, not the Nazi-led Holocaust.Trump, the son of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, spoke to NBC News after the Anti-Defamation League, which combats anti-Semitism, asked him to retract his statement.""Trivialization of the Holocaust and gas chambers is NEVER okay,"" the Anti-Defamation League tweeted.John Podesta, the chair of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign, told reporters on a call that the wording of Trump's remark was ""extremely insensitive, divisive and probably pretty consistent with the kind of rhetoric he heard around the house when he was growing up.""
""I think it's never acceptable to use language like that,"" Podesta added.Nazis used gas chambers during World War Two to kill millions of Jews imprisoned in European concentration camps.Trump made the ""gas chamber"" remark during an interview with a Philadelphia radio station on Thursday morning to explain how the media would react if the Republican Party had intervened in the nominating contest the way the Democratic Party has been accused of doing to benefit Clinton over former party rival U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders.
""Without the media, this wouldn't even be a contest, but the media has built her up, they've let her slide on every discrepancy, on every lie, on every DNC game, trying to get Bernie Sanders out of the thing,"" Trump said. ""If Republicans were doing that, they'd be warming up the gas chamber right now,"" the nominee's son added.
Trump's campaign said the uproar over the comment was another example of bias among the media covering the presidential campaign.""Don Jr. was clearly referring to capital punishment to make the case that the media continues to take words out of context in order to serve as the propaganda arm of the Hillary Clinton campaign,"" Trump spokesman Jason Miller said in an email.

GREENSBORO, N.C. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said on Thursday the success of the Syrian ceasefire brokered by the United States and Russia depends on whether Moscow decides it is in its interest to follow through with the agreement.""Whether or not this works is really up to the Russians,"" Clinton told reporters after addressing a campaign rally in Greensboro, North Carolina. ""It is up to whether or not Vladimir Putin decides that it's time to do what the Russians can do to bring this conflict into a period where there can be the beginning of political discussions, a hoped-for protective zone for people who are under relentless assault form the air, and a commitment to going after the terrorist groups that pose a threat to everyone.""

WASHINGTON U.S. senators questioned State Department officials closely on Thursday about corruption in Afghanistan and said failure to address it could cause them to rethink the billions of dollars the United States spends there each year.""I don't know what the political will here in the United States will be to continue to support the Afghans in light of what is going on there,"" said Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.Menendez described himself as someone who has been supportive of U.S. Afghanistan policy, but said he would ""have a totally different view"" if the government in Kabul does not act.On Wednesday, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) issued a report that strongly criticized Washington for pouring billions of dollars into Afghanistan with so little oversight that it fueled corruption and undermined the U.S. mission.
The United States spends $5 billion per year in Afghanistan, about $4 billion for defense and national security and another $1 billion in civilian assistance, plus billions more for the cost of the thousands of troops and military contractors there.Richard Olson, the State Department's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, agreed that corruption can undermine governance. But he called Afghan President Ashraf Ghani ""a committed partner"" in fighting corruption.
Ghani, Olson said, has taken steps including addressing the Kabul Bank scandal, canceling a fuel contract and setting up a monitoring and evaluation committee with experts on anti-corruption.
""It is a dramatically different situation from what it was prior to 2014,"" Olson testified.     (Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Bill Rigby)"

By Lisa Lambert
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Concerns about coordinating U.S. derivatives regulation with that of other countries dominated a Senate committee's hearing on Thursday to consider two nominees for seats on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Members of both parties asked the nominees, Chris Brummer, a Georgetown University law professor, and Brian Quintenz, an investment firm founder who once worked for a Republican Representative, about cooperation with other countries during the Agriculture Committee hearing. The committee will vote on the nominations in a separate business meeting. If approved, the nominations then go to the full Senate.The CFTC oversees the U.S. derivatives market and recently gave swap dealers an extra month to comply with a new cross-border rule on collateral for uncleared swaps, after Asia's market froze from uncertainty about the changes. The European Commission announced this summer it was delaying its implementation of similar rules.
Both Brummer and Quintenz spoke of the need to build strong relationships with other countries. But Brummer emphasized the U.S. role in leading rulemaking.""Overall, I think that it's hard...to lead if you don't lead by example. I think if you want to have a cross-border regulatory environment that is high quality then the United States should commit to the highest standards and find those who are like-minded,"" he said.Meanwhile, Quintenz worried firms could exploit timing gaps between different countries' rules implementation for financial gain, calling it ""regulatory arbitrage.""
""Someone does have to go first but I don't believe that's the full analysis,"" he said. ""I believe the full analysis is: after you go first how long will it be until all the jurisdictions move and what is the size of the regulatory arbitrage you're creating? And once other jurisdictions move  will there be regulatory arbitrage going forward?""Republican Senator Thom Tillis said that in the current situation ""it's almost like we're being penalized for good behavior.""
""We're on time. Some of the other key players are not...Our banking industry is suffering as we move forward with regulations that make us globally make us un-competitive,"" he said.Separately, at a speech on Thursday, CFTC Chairman Timothy Massad said he had been assured by European counterparts that their delay in implementing their swaps margin rule would be short and he hoped it would be in place by March 1. He added the CFTC will explore actions it could take if the delay stretches on longer. (Editing by Peter Cooney and Andrew Hay)"

By Ian Simpson

The Virginia Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a Republican bid to have Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe held in contempt for his continued effort to restore voting rights to about 206,000 felons.The high court said it would not require McAuliffe to prove that he is complying with its July 22 ruling that struck down his initial blanket attempt to restore felons' voting rights.The one-page order also said justices would not let Republican legislative leaders seek more documents through a discovery process.
McAuliffe's efforts to restore voting rights to felons is seen as a possible aid in tipping Virginia, a swing state in the Nov. 8 presidential election, toward Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Opinion polls show her leading Republican candidate Donald Trump in the state.Republican legislative leaders this month filed a contempt motion against McAuliffe. It came after McAuliffe said he had restored voting rights to almost 13,000 felons on a case-by-case basis after the state Supreme Court blocked his blanket clemency effort.
In a statement, McAuliffe said he was pleased by the court's decision. ""Restoring these Virginians' civil rights is morally the right thing to do,"" he said.McAuliffe has said his original order would move Virginia away from lifetime disenfranchisement that hits African-Americans particularly hard.
Many of the convicts who benefited were African-Americans or Latinos, two groups that have voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates in the past. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, won Virginia in 2012 and 2008. (Reporting by Ian Simpson in Washington; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)"

Donald Trump knows he could stand to lose a few pounds but otherwise is in great health, campaign adviser Sarah Huckabee Sanders told MSNBC on Wednesday after the Republican presidential candidate filmed a TV segment about his well-being.Trump taped an episode of the ""Dr. Oz Show"" in New York that will air on Thursday, in which he gave host Dr. Mehmet Oz a summary of a physical exam conducted last week. Trump's campaign has said he will also release more medical information to the public.The show released a short clip on Wednesday that did not include any medical information. In it, Trump told Oz he had two letters with him showing results of tests conducted last week. ""May I see them?"" Oz, a cardiothoracic surgeon, asked, sitting in a chair next to the 70-year-old New York businessman.""Yeah, sure,"" Trump said, handing over papers he pulled from his jacket pocket.
Huckabee Sanders said she did not see the summary Trump showed Oz, but said she knew he got a ""great report and is in very good health."" She said Trump's rigorous campaign schedule showed his stamina.""He self-admitted he could lose a few pounds,"" she said. ""I think that's most of America, but otherwise he's in incredibly good health."" 
Trump and Hillary Clinton, 68, the Democrat facing him in the Nov. 8 presidential election, have both promised to release more medical information. Clinton this week took several days off the campaign trail to recuperate from a bout with pneumonia, after she nearly collapsed on Sunday at a memorial ceremony for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Clinton plans to resume campaigning on Thursday, her spokesman said.
Previously, Trump's campaign issued a short letter from his doctor saying he was in excellent health, but without such details as whether he takes any medications. Clinton in 2015 released a two-page letter outlining her own medical condition. (Reporting by Emily Stephenson; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"
