By Ginger Gibson and Emily Stephenson
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND Ted Cruz was recounting to an audience how he had outlasted most of his 16 rivals for the Republican presidential nomination when a plane carrying the man who had won it all, Donald Trump, flew overhead, interrupting him mid-speech.""All right, that was pretty well-orchestrated,"" said Cruz, a Republican U.S. senator from Texas who waged a bitter campaign against Trump.Hours later Cruz would take his revenge, refusing to endorse Trump and urging Republicans to vote their conscience during a prime-time speech on the floor of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. He left the podium to a chorus of boos, and his wife was escorted off the floor as the convention erupted in rancor.Susan Hutchison, chair of the Washington state delegation, said she confronted Cruz after his speech and called him a ""traitor to the party.""So much for party unity.Over three days in Cleveland this week, Republican leaders sought to sell a story of unity. They repeatedly said the party was getting ever closer to rallying behind Trump, who is running on the slogan ""Make America Great Again!"" and whose candidacy has divided many and exposed deep discontent among  Republicans with their leaders. But in a few minutes on Wednesday night that show of unity was blown apart in spectacular fashion.Cruz's non-committal speech infuriated Trump supporters among the thousands of delegates cramming the floor of the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. But their angry jeers triggered recriminations from other delegates.  ""They talk about unity and then they act like that. That is not going to get us to unify,"" said Manette Merrill, a Cruz delegate from Washington state. Trump will get the opportunity to rally the party when he formally accepts its nomination on Thursday night in a speech expected to be watched by millions of Americans, including undecided and independent voters.WINNING OVER SKEPTICS
One of Trump's key goals going into this week's convention was to unite the party after a roughly 18-month primary season that was marked by personal attacks on candidates, sometimes violent rallies, and deep disagreement over what it means to be a Republican.
In public and in private the Trump campaign tried to win over skeptics who feel the New York businessman and celebrity TV star does not represent the party's values. It took a harder stance against opponents, for example shutting down a desperate last-minute bid on the convention floor early in the week to stop his nomination. ""It's like a slow crawl,"" former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said of the unity drive as he made the rounds at the convention. ""You're kind of doing it. You're kind of looking around to see if anyone else is doing it,"" he told Reuters. But almost from the start there were blatant signs of party disunity. Ohio Governor John Kasich, who lost to Trump in the nomination fight and disagrees with Trump on a host of issues, declined to attend the convention held in his own state.Instead, he greeted his supporters at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame close to the convention arena to the blaring tune of The Who's ""Baba O'Riley"" with lyrics like, ""I don't need to fight to prove I'm right.""Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort told reporters that Kasich was ""embarrassing his state"" by refusing to get on the Trump train. His remarks were a reminder of the sort of insults that many Republicans had hoped would disappear after a brutal primary season that was characterized by Trump's often personal attacks on his opponents.
PLEAS FOR UNITY 
The pleas for unity were frequent in Cleveland, led by House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the top elected Republican, who has been slow in warming to Trump.""What do you say that we unify this party at this crucial moment when unity is everything?"" Ryan asked thousands of convention attendees on Tuesday night. It was the biggest applause line of his speech - delegates cheered, clapped and waved signs.But U.S. Senator Mike Lee of Utah, one of the ""never Trump"" holdouts, is still not convinced. ""Federalism and separation of powers - if he focuses on that, he brings along a lot of conservatives like me who haven't been sold yet,"" Lee told Reuters. ""He needs to make that a distinct part of his message.""Trump and his surrogates have offered scant policy details so far at the convention, nor have they been able to put to rest questions about whether they are capable of mounting a sophisticated presidential campaign to take on his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.
The convention has been overshadowed, for example, by controversy surrounding his wife Melania's convention speech - which included lines uttered by first lady Michelle Obama at the Democratic convention in 2008 - and the campaign's initial reluctance to admit the plagiarism.Some Republicans thought it was an unnecessary distraction at a time when the party should be focused on selling itself and its new leader to Americans. Others said that if Trump was really serious about uniting the party he would reach out to his vanquished foes on the campaign trail, including Cruz and Kasich.  Ken Cope, a Texas delegate who had backed Cruz for president but will vote for Trump, said the New York businessman needs to ""swallow his pride"" and stress the contributions his 16 defeated rivals made to the primary process instead of belittling them.""He's a prideful man and he's proud of what he is but we're in a general election campaign and it's going to take all of us pulling on the rope if we're going to pull the ship to the final line,"" Cope said.Still others said Trump needed to be more disciplined.Trump supporter John Whitmer, a delegate from Wichita, Kansas, said Trump made a mistake by going on Fox News on Monday night to rail against Kasich as speakers were lauding his candidacy at the televised convention.""You just stepped on your best act,"" Whitmer said. ""I get that you want to talk about Kasich, but everybody needed to be watching what was going on there.""After Wednesday night, the best hope for the Republican Party to come together may rest on Clinton, who was frequently vilified at the Cleveland convention this week. She will be formally nominated as the Democratic presidential nominee at her party's convention in Philadelphia next week.When asked if the party was unified, former Speaker of the House of Representatives and close Trump adviser, Newt Gingrich, replied: ""No, but we will be by the end of Philadelphia.""""Trump will get us to 90 percent unity. She'll get us the rest of the way.""

STOCKHOLM Sweden's Vattenfall will invest 3 billion Swedish crowns ($349 million) in a Scottish offshore wind farm that U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump tried to stop being built near his luxury golf course in Scotland.State-owned utility Vattenfall, which will take 100 percent ownership of the project from Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group, described its investment as a vote of confidence in Britain after the nation's decision to leave the European Union.""The decision to invest ... comes only a few weeks after the British referendum on leaving the EU and demonstrates Vattenfall's continuing long-term commitment to wind power in Great Britain,"" the company said in a statement.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she would not rule out the possibility of Scotland remaining in the EU.Sturgeon said that a second independence referendum is now a possibility, though she has also emphasized that another vote would not take place until it is clear that most Scots are in favor of breaking from the United Kingdom.
Vattenfall said the wind farm will have capacity of 92.4 megawatts, which could potentially supply about 130,000 households with energy. It will also serve as a center for testing and developing new technologies for offshore wind power.In December last year Britain's top court threw out a bid by Trump to stop the 11-turbine wind farm from being built near his multimillion-dollar resort.
The Trump Organization had denounced the Scottish government as ""foolish, small minded and parochial"". The Scottish National Party's foreign affairs spokesman Alex Salmond replied that Trump was ""three times a loser"".Construction is expected to start in the latter part of 2017, with the wind farm expected to start generating electricity in spring 2018. Onshore construction activity will start later this year.

By Amy Tennery and Ginger Gibson
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND U.S. Senator Ted Cruz refused to endorse Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at the party's convention on Wednesday, drawing angry jeers from Trump supporters and shattering the facade of party unity that has been carefully built up in Cleveland this week.Anti-Trump Republican delegate Ken Cuccinelli told Reuters he escorted Cruz's wife, Heidi, off the floor of the Republican National Convention out of concern for her safety following her husband's speech.For the third day in a row, what was supposed to be a carefully scripted show of unity was thrown into turmoil by unexpected events that have raised questions about whether the party can unite around Trump to defeat the presumptive Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, in the Nov. 8 election. Cruz, who came in a distant second to Trump in the race for the Republican nomination, stopped short of endorsing Trump after a bitter and personal campaign and mentioned him only once, drawing boos and repeated chants of ""We want Trump.""Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general, said: ""When the speech ended, there was an ugly crowd behind us."" A witness said one person shouted: ""Goldman Sachs"" at Heidi Cruz in reference to her employment at the investment bank.Cruz began his speech saying: ""I want to congratulate Donald Trump on winning the nomination last night."" Later in the speech, he urged: ""Please, don't stay home in November. Stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution.""Some critics saw the appeal for people to vote their conscience as a vote of no-confidence in Trump. Republican strategist Eric Fehrnstrom, who is not affiliated with any campaign, tweeted: ""'Vote your conscience' was the rallying cry of the Never Trump movement. For Cruz to bring that message into #RNC hall was a colossal error.""""It's taken me about 30 minutes to calm down and stop shaking with anger,"" said Erik Layton, an alternate delegate from California who had shouted: ""Go home"" at Cruz after his speech. ""I just don't know why Cruz did this. It baffles my mind.""Trump, 70, a businessman and former reality TV star who has never been elected to public office, made his entrance to the convention hall near the end of Cruz's speech, applauding Cruz's remarks but, by his appearance, drawing attention away from his former rival.In a tweet after the convention adjourned for the night, Trump wrote that Cruz broke a promise they both had made to endorse the party's White House choice.""Wow, Ted Cruz got booed off the stage, didn't honor the pledge! I saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway. No big deal!"" Trump wrote.
EXCHANGE OF INSULTS
During the campaign for the party's nomination, Trump insulted Cruz's wife's looks and suggested the Texan's father was with John F. Kennedy's assassin just before the president was shot in Dallas in 1963. Cruz, 45, who as a Tea Party conservative in the U.S. Senate angered many mainstream Republicans in Congress and spearheaded tactics that led to a government shutdown over the federal budget, called Trump a ""serial philanderer"" and a ""narcissist"" during the campaign.A Cruz adviser who asked to remain anonymous said Cruz anticipated a backlash from the crowd if he did not endorse Trump.""We knew people were going to be mad if he didn't say the words, but he congratulated him and called for unity behind common values. He expected people to not be thrilled about this,"" the adviser said. Trump won the party's nomination on Tuesday with 1,725 delegates, followed by Cruz with 475 delegates.
Several delegates were outraged by the reaction to Cruz's speech, saying it could undermine Trump's support among Republicans who had supported the senator from Texas.""I thought it was shameful,"" said Manette Merrill, a Cruz delegate from Washington state, adding she was now confident she would not vote for Trump in November. ""They talk about unity ... and then they act like that. That is not going to get us to unify,"" she said.The drama did not prevent Trump's vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, from receiving a raucous welcome inside the convention hall to end the day's events.Accepting the convention's nomination, Pence spoke of Trump as a friend of the working class who has persevered in the business world. ""He's a doer in a game usually reserved for talkers,"" Pence said.Trump briefly joined Pence on the stage, shook his hand, patted him on the back, gave a thumbs-up and, in a signal to the crowd, pointed at Pence. But the Cruz speech, the latest in a series of disruptions, overshadowed any show of solidarity.CRUZ A TOP SOCIAL MEDIA TOPIC

Cruz swiftly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter and Facebook immediately following his speech, with about 157 tweets mentioning his official Twitter handle @tedcruz posted every minute. The overall immediate sentiment was slightly more positive than negative, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph.The most mentioned moment on Twitter on Wednesday was the crowd's reaction to Trump's arrival at the conclusion of Cruz's speech. Cruz was also the most mentioned speaker of the night, followed by Pence. Cruz was the most searched speaker on Google.In a speech minutes after Cruz finished, former U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich veered from his prepared text to defend Cruz.""I think you misunderstood one paragraph that Ted Cruz, who is a superb orator, said. And I just want to point it out to you. Ted Cruz said you can vote your conscience for anyone who will uphold the Constitution. In this election, there is only one candidate who will uphold the Constitution,"" Gingrich said.""To paraphrase Ted Cruz, if you want to protect the Constitution of the United States, the only possible candidate this fall is the Trump-Pence Republican ticket,"" Gingrich said.The convention, due to end on Thursday with Trump's speech accepting the party's nomination, has been marked by turmoil from Day One. On Monday, chaos erupted when Trump opponents inside his party stormed out of the room and others chanted to vent frustration over a failed attempt to force a vote in opposition to Trump.On Tuesday, similarities between some phrases in a speech by Trump's wife, Melania, and a 2008 speech by first lady Michelle Obama triggered accusations of plagiarism, putting the Trump campaign on the defensive. A staff writer for the Trump Organization on Wednesday took responsibility for the ""chaos"" over the speech.Eminent Republicans such as the party's previous two presidential nominees, Mitt Romney and Senator John McCain, and members of the Bush family that gave the party its last two presidents have stayed away from Cleveland in a show of displeasure at Trump and his rhetoric against illegal immigration and free trade.Opponents brand Trump a bigot with his calls to temporarily ban the entry of Muslims and to build a border wall with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants.Underscoring the problems Trump has faced with U.S. allies abroad, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told Reuters on Wednesday that Trump threatened U.S. and world security with his ""politics of fear and isolation.""

5	5	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-hamm-exclusive-idUSKCN10100Z	Exclusive: Trump considering fracking mogul Harold Hamm as energy secretary - sources	"


By Michelle Conlin
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is considering nominating Oklahoma oil and gas mogul Harold Hamm as energy secretary if elected to the White House on Nov. 8, according to four sources close to Trump's campaign.The chief executive of Continental Resources (CLR.N) would be the first U.S. energy secretary drawn directly from the oil and gas industry since the cabinet position was created in 1977, a move that would jolt environmental advocates but bolster Trump's pro-drilling energy platform. Dan Eberhart, an oil investor and Republican financier, said he had been told by officials in Trump's campaign that Hamm, who has been an informal advisor to Trump on energy policy since at least May, was ""the leading contender"" for the position. Eberhart said he had discussed the possible appointment with  top donors at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this week, where Trump was formally nominated as the party's candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election.Three other sources close to the Trump campaign confirmed Trump was considering Hamm for the post. One of the sources said he first heard that Hamm was a contender from Trump officials on Sunday. None of the sources was aware of who else Trump may be considering for the job.Representatives for Trump and Hamm did not respond to a request for comment. Addressing the convention on Wednesday night, Hamm called for expanded drilling and said too much environmental regulation    threatened to limit U.S. oil production and increase the country's dependence on Middle Eastern oil producers.
""Every time we can't drill a well in America, terrorism is being funded,"" Hamm told the cheering crowd. ""Every onerous regulation puts American lives at risk.""    Hamm, 70, became one of America's wealthiest men during the U.S. oil and gas drilling boom over the past decade, tapping into new hydraulic fracturing drilling technology to access vast deposits in North Dakota's shale fields.Past heads of the U.S. Department of Energy, which is charged with advancing U.S. energy security and technology and dealing with nuclear waste disposal, have typically boasted a political or academic background.This is not the first time Hamm has been in contention for the job.
The Republican Party's presidential nominee in 2012, Mitt Romney, vetted Hamm to be energy secretary but ultimately decided against him because the two men have differing positions on renewable energy sources like wind. He made headlines in 2015 after settling a protracted divorce case and agreeing to pay his ex-wife $975 million - reported to be the biggest divorce settlement in history. His fortune is now estimated at nearly $12 billion.  ""FRACKER-IN-CHIEF""

Trump, who has yet to make any announcements about his prospective cabinet, has already surrounded himself with strong advocates of traditional energy sources like oil, gas, and coal and has promised to gut environmental regulations to boost drilling and mining if elected.He tapped U.S. Congressman Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, a climate skeptic and drilling advocate, to help draw up his campaign energy platform, and picked Indiana Governor Mike Pence, also a climate skeptic, as his running mate. Both moves cheered the energy industry but alarmed environmental activists who say a Trump presidency would set back years of progress on issues like pollution and climate change. ""Given that Hamm's as close as we've got to a fracker-in-chief in this country, it would be an apropos pick for a president who thinks global warming is a hoax manufactured by the Chinese,"" said leading environmental activist Bill McKibben. Trump's Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has promised to bolster regulation and increase use of renewable fuels to combat climate change if elected.

By Michelle Conlin and and Grant Smith
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who gained popularity partly by bashing wealthy donors and vowing to fund his own campaign, raised nearly as much money in June as the campaign of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, according to federal reports filed on Wednesday.In the first month in which the Trump campaign's fundraising machine officially cranked up, Trump raised nearly $20 million from individual donors other than himself, as well as $2 million from donors to his joint fundraising committee with the Republican Party.The reports also showed that Trump converted the nearly $50 million in loans he made to his campaign into donations. He has $20 million in cash in the bank. 
Clinton's campaign brought in $24 million from individual donors during the same period, and a further $11.5 million from donors to her joint fundraising committee. 
Trump's new money dash was also evident at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this week, where two Trump Super PACs - each dueling for supremacy and boasting a roster of marquee donors - held private events.Those in the donor class backing Trump include investor Foster Friess and casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who associates say is considering pouring as much as $100 million into helping Trump get elected.

""We hope relevant parties stop their groundless accusations against China and interference in China's domestic affairs and contribute more to bilateral trust and cooperation,"" it added.The platform, adopted on Monday, says China has been asserting ""preposterous"" claims to the South China Sea to distract its people from economic problems, practices ""cultural genocide"" in Tibet and Xinjiang, and reaffirms a commitment to sell weapons to self-ruled Taiwan.
China's foreign ministry said promoting stable growth in relations serves the interests of both countries and the peace and development of the Asia-Pacific region and the world, and ""both sides should adhere to this right direction"".

By Adam DeRose and Amanda Becker
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democrat Hillary Clinton, who is running against Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election, is expected to announce her running mate as early as Friday.Here are some of the potential vice presidential candidates Clinton is considering, according to U.S. news media:TIM KAINE
The U.S. senator from Virginia is a former Roman Catholic missionary and civil rights lawyer who is fluent in Spanish.Kaine, a former Richmond mayor and former Virginia governor, has served on the Senate's Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees.    He has backed liberal causes such as establishing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. But, like many Republicans and moderate Democrats, he has supported free-trade deals, a stance at odds with many party progressives.TOM VILSACK
The U.S. agriculture secretary is a former governor of Iowa. During the primary, he campaigned enthusiastically for Clinton, speaking about his family's struggles with addiction and mental health. Clinton has promised to address those issues if elected.Vilsack, a Pittsburgh native, was orphaned and adopted as an infant. He settled in his wife's home state of Iowa.CORY BOOKER

New Jersey's first black U.S. senator is a former Newark mayor. He was elected to the Senate in a 2013 special election and won re-election in 2014.Booker campaigned enthusiastically for Clinton, including in the crucial early-voting state of New Hampshire during her primary race against Senator Bernie Sanders.ELIZABETH WARREN
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is a fierce critic of Wall Street who spearheaded the creation of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after the global financial crisis. President Barack Obama tapped her to help set up the agency, but congressional Republicans blocked her appointment.Warren is popular with progressives, and was urged to run for president in 2016 but declined.She endorsed Clinton in June, then joined her on the campaign trail.
JAMES STAVRIDIS
The retired Navy admiral and former supreme allied commander of NATO is the dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University near Boston.Stavridis worked closely with Clinton when he was at NATO and she led the State Department during Obama's first term.Though Stavridis would bring military heft to Clinton's ticket, his role as a senior military official in the George W. Bush administration during the early years of the U.S. occupation of Iraq could provide Trump with a line of attack. Trump has criticized Clinton for, as a U.S. senator, voting for the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. SHERROD BROWN

The U.S. senator from Ohio and former member of the U.S. House of Representatives is one of the Democratic Party's leading progressives.Brown was an early opponent of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement sought by the Obama administration, describing it as a ""giveaway to corporations.""TOM PEREZ
Obama's labor secretary has championed changes in regulations popular with organized labor and progressives. Perez reversed a regulation exempting domestic and home-care workers from overtime pay and extended overtime protections to some salaried workers by lowering the eligibility threshold. Perez has little campaigning experience, however, having only held one term on a county council from 2002 to 2006. JULIAN CASTRO
The Department of Housing and Urban Development secretary is considered a rising Democratic star.Castro has pushed for expanding opportunities while serving as housing secretary, including by broadening internet access across the country. But progressive groups have criticized his agency's sale of mortgage loans to big banks rather than non-profits during his tenure.A former San Antonio mayor, Castro was elected as the city's youngest councilman at the age of 26.
