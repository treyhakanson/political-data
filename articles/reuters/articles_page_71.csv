| GREENSBORO, N.C.

GREENSBORO, N.C. President Barack Obama won two straight elections for the White House, but on Tuesday during a talk with students at a town hall on race and sports he discussed a few times when he did not always come out on top. Obama recounted the fallout from his first presidential debate in his ultimately successful 2012 election race against Republican Mitt Romney.""I had that first debate, which was roundly panned. Everybody said you were terrible,"" Obama said at the town hall hosted by ESPN's The Undefeated at North Carolina A&T State University. ""What is true is that I've always kind of hated these debate formats, so it wasn't my best performance.""He said what really inspired him to ""dig deep"" for the second debate was seeing young volunteers around the country. While they put on a brave face, Obama said he could tell they were worried about the race.
""I just thought to myself these kids are pouring their hearts and souls into making calls and knocking on doors, I'm not going to disappoint them,"" he said. Obama also described his experience losing his first campaign for a U.S. congressional seat in 2000 and how it humbled him. Without that defeat, Obama said he did not believe he would have went on to win his Senate race in 2004. 
""What is true about politics that is similar to sports, though, is when you lose, you lose publicly,"" he said. ""It's a hard feeling. One of the benefits of defeat is to take some of the vanity out of what it is you're trying to achieve.""The issue of race and sports has been in the spotlight recently after NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick of the San Francisco 49ers started a controversial movement when he chose to stay seated, and then later opted to kneel, for the national anthem this season to protest racial injustice. 
Asked about sports and activism, Obama cited two of his childhood sports heroes: boxer Muhammad Ali and tennis player Arthur Ashe. Both had totally different styles, with Obama saying Ali was more outspoken and Ashe more buttoned down. But he said they both brought about change.""How you do it is less important than your commitment to use whatever platforms you have to speak to the issues that matter,"" he said.

By Amanda Becker
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Hillary Clinton's campaign was worried about the ""hard balance"" she would need to strike as the presidential candidate prepared to oppose a Pacific trade pact championed by President Barack Obama that she once supported, according to emails published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks.WikiLeaks released its latest batch of apparently hacked personal emails of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta with exactly four weeks left in the 2016 presidential campaign before the Nov. 8 election.White House hopefuls have made trade a key theme of their campaigns, with the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a prime target for criticism by both Democrat Clinton and Republican opponent Donald Trump. In an Oct. 6, 2015, email the day after the Obama administration finalized the details of the TPP, Clinton speechwriter Dan Schwerin circulated a new draft of a statement the campaign was preparing about Clinton's position, according to WikiLeaks.""This is indeed a hard balance to strike,"" Schwerin wrote in the email to a handful of top advisers, ""since we don't want to invite mockery for being too enthusiastically opposed to a deal she once championed, or over-claiming how bad it is, since it's a very close call on the merits."" The next day, as she campaigned in Iowa, the first state to pick candidates during the nominating contest, the campaign released a statement from Clinton saying the pact did not meet the ""very high"" bar she had set to earn her support.The Clinton campaign declined to verify the authenticity of the latest batch of Podesta emails released by WikiLeaks. Podesta told reporters on Tuesday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation notified him it is investigating the ""criminal"" hack of his emails published by WikiLeaks as part of a broader political hacking probe.The U.S. government last week formally accused Russia of hacking Democratic Party organizations in an effort to influence the presidential election, a charge Russia has denied. As a result, Clinton campaign officials and supporters have warned that such email releases could include fraudulent or misleading documents among genuine emails.  
Clinton's October 2015 announcement on the TPP came just a week before the first debate in her primary race against U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, a vocal opponent of the deal. Key Democratic constituencies, such as progressives and organized labor, have also criticized the pact.Clinton had previously declined to say whether she would support the TPP, a main tenet of Obama's strategic pivot to Asia that began when she was his secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, explaining that she wanted to wait to assess the final negotiated terms.""I accept the position we're taking but she has generally been more pro-trade than anti,"" Clinton strategist Joel Benenson responded to the draft from Schwerin. ""While we're opposing this, don't we want to say something generally about ensuring American manufacturers can compete around the world?""
EARLY WARREN MEETINGS
Clinton's nascent campaign began meeting with advisers to U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren even before Clinton announced her second White House bid, according to the hacked emails.In a January 2015 email sent three months before Clinton officially launched her campaign, Schwerin briefed close aides about a meeting with a longtime policy adviser to Warren, a firebrand leader of the Democratic Party's liberal wing. Warren's team was concerned that Clinton would staff her campaign with economic advisers that were too closely associated with the centrist policies of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, such as those championed by his Treasury secretary, Robert Rubin.
The Warren adviser, Dan Geldon, ""laid out a detailed case against the Bob Rubin school of Democratic policy makers, was very critical of the Obama administration's choices,"" Schwerin wrote.Schwerin said he and Geldon went over a list of recommended hires that Warren had sent to Clinton. Geldon told him they would be ""watching carefully"" to see how Clinton staffed her campaign, Schwerin wrote.""They seem wary - and pretty convinced that the Rubin folks have the inside track with us whether we realize it yet or not,"" Schwerin wrote of Warren's advisers. Geldon declined to comment on the email.Schwerin also added that Geldon expressed ""some flexibility on Glass-Steagall,"" a Depression-era law that prohibited commercial banks from engaging in risky trading activities that was repealed during Bill Clinton's administration. ""Said too big too fail is the bigger issue,"" Schwerin wrote.Many Democratic activists believe that reinstating Glass-Steagall would help prevent future financial crises such as the one that rocked the U.S. economy in 2008. Warren has said that there are two ways to break up too-big banks, either based on size alone or by instituting a modern version of Glass-Steagall. She introduced a bill in the U.S. Senate to reinstate a version of the law.Clinton weighed supporting a new Glass-Steagall law but eventually rejected that route, announcing a risk-based approach for breaking up banks, according to an email WikiLeaks released on Monday.

By Luciana Lopez
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's hardline rhetoric on immigration might not trigger the surge in Latino voter turnout for which many activists are hoping, according to a Pew Research Center survey released on Tuesday.About 89 percent of Latino registered voters who were surveyed said they planned to vote in the Nov. 8 election, down from 91 percent who said in October 2012 that they were planning to vote in that year's election. The decrease was within the survey's plus or minus 4.6 percent margin of error.The Pew report was based on a bilingual telephone survey of 1,507 Latino adults, including 804 registered voters, from Aug. 23 through Sept. 21. In July 2008, four months before the presidential election that year, 94 percent of respondents said they planned to vote.According to previous Pew research, about 81.7 percent of Hispanic registered voters cast ballots in 2012, the year  Democratic President Barack Obama ran successfully against Republican Mitt Romney. That turnout was down from 84 percent in 2008, when Obama ran against Republican John McCain and won.The latest Pew survey found that Democrats continued to maintain an edge as the party ""more concerned"" for Latinos. Hillary Clinton is relying on a coalition of minority voters to help her against Trump, who launched his presidential bid last year by calling some Mexican immigrants rapists and promising to build a wall to stop them entering the United States.
Latinos, a growing segment of the U.S. electorate with rising influence in closely fought states like Florida and Nevada, tend to lean Democratic and favor Clinton heavily over Trump. According to the survey, some 58 percent support Clinton compared to 19 percent for Trump. Another 10 percent favor Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and 6 percent prefer Green candidate Jill Stein.MAKE THE DIFFERENCE
 Turnout among Latinos tends to run well below that of whites and African Americans, blunting their impact in political races. 
A number of civic groups opposed to Trump have been working to ensure Latinos get to the polls. Pew said that 27.3 million Latinos were eligible to vote. However, knowing how many of those people are registered is harder to measure because many states do not capture information such as race or ethnicity along with voter registration information. In 2012 an estimated 11.2 million Latinos voted in the presidential election, according to Pew. In 2008 that figure was 9.7 million Latino voters.While one must be a U.S. citizen to cast a ballot in U.S.  elections, requirements for voter registration can vary by state. 
Immigrants' rights group America's Voice, for example, launched a new Spanish language radio ad in Miami and Orlando for the next two weeks bashing Trump's hardline immigration proposals, which include deporting all undocumented foreigners and making it harder for would-be immigrants to get visas.In Nevada, the Culinary Union, which is heavily Latino, is working to ensure its members get to the polls, helping them with logistics like finding their polling stations and arranging transport.""It could make the difference between a one point loss and a one point win,"" said Yvanna Cancela, the union's political director.Sergio Garcia-Rios, a professor of Latino studies at Cornell University, said Clinton could be missing an opportunity to drive voter turnout further by not engaging Latino voters enough on policy.""We can't just rely on an anger reaction to Donald Trump,"" he said. The challenge is ""to create enthusiasm for Latinos to get out and vote.""   (Reporting by Luciana Lopez; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)"

By David Brunnstrom
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON An adviser to Donald Trump said on Tuesday he could not foresee any circumstances in the short or medium term in which the Republican presidential nominee would meet the leader of North Korea if he became president.The remark appeared to take a step back from Trump's position in May, when he told Reuters he was willing to talk to Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program.Peter Hoekstra, a former Republican congressman and now an adviser to Trump, was asked at a debate on U.S. policy towards North Korea under what conditions Trump would meet Kim.""I can't imagine any set of circumstances, in the short or intermediate future, that would see President Trump in a summit meeting with the leader of North Korea,"" he said.Hoekstra avoided directly repeating suggestions by Trump that U.S. allies Japan and South Korea could be allowed to develop nuclear weapons to defend themselves against North Korea, rather than relying on the U.S. nuclear umbrella.
""That will be decided once South Korea, Japan the United States identify what their objectives are going to be vis-a-vis North Korea and the tactics they are going to put in place to address that objective,"" he said, when asked to clarify where Trump stood on the issue.However, Hoekstra added that it would be ""stated very, very clearly, as we go into those discussions with South Korea and Japan, that everything's on the table.""Former Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia Kurt Campbell, a supporter of Trump's rival Hillary Clinton, said: ""The real issue here is, 'Is this strategically wise?'""
According to Campbell, Trump had said ""maybe in the heat of the campaign ... things that have been deeply unnerving to Asia.""Hoekstra said Trump was not seeking to challenge U.S. friendships in Asia, but it was necessary to sit down with allies to develop a successful North Korea strategy.
Asked about Trump's complaints that Asian allies were freeloading on the United States, he said Trump's business background meant some of his statements came out ""a little bit more coarse than some of us in the political world might be comfortable with.""But allies would be expected to pay their ""fair share"" as U.S. taxpayers could not subsidize the defense of others, he said.Asked if their candidates considered preemptive strikes a conceivable means of dealing with North Korea's nuclear program, both Campbell and Hoekstra said no options were off the table.

By Dave McKinney and Karen Pierog
| CHICAGO

CHICAGO Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel moved this week to bolster his sagging political fortunes, delivering within a few hours both a labor pact with the city's teachers and a no-drama 2017 city budget devoid of any big tax hikes.On Tuesday morning, Emanuel unveiled a $9.8 billion city spending plan for fiscal 2017 that includes $3.7 billion for operations, relying on $82.3 million in revenue growth, savings from efficiencies and a few one-time measures.Since winning re-election last year, the Democratic mayor has been dealing with racially charged fallout from the 2014 police shooting of a black teenager and the pension-driven financial hardships facing the city and its school system.""It is a budget free of an immediate pension crisis, free of the black cloud of insolvency threatening the retirements of city employees and the financial future of Chicago,"" Emanuel told the city council.Twelve hours earlier, he signed off on a four-year tentative contract deal with teachers in the country's third-largest public school system to avert what would have been a third strike in four years. The pact, which still must be ratified by the Chicago Teachers Union, relies on a bigger injection of surplus revenue he controls from the city's development districts.
To be sure, the spate of good news for Emanuel does not mean the mayor is free of political trouble.In 2016, Emanuel reeled from the effects of street protests stemming from the death of unarmed, 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, whom a white police officer shot 16 times. Emanuel's administration kept a police video of the killing under wraps while he ran for re-election last year.More broadly, street violence in Chicago continues unabated, leaving the city with more murders this year than New York City and Los Angeles combined. The city budget Emanuel outlined accommodates the initial phase of a two-year plan to add 970 police positions to address the city's sharp spike in violence.
""Until we see the focus on crime in the city and the policing issue from the mayor in more ways than we saw this summer, which was not a lot of focus until it was absolutely necessary, that's one of the biggest issues in the city,"" said Alderman Scott Waguespack, an Emanuel critic and member of the city council's progressive bloc.Financially, the city has faced a series of credit rating downgrades due to an unfunded pension liability that Moody's Investors Service has said is the highest among U.S. municipalities it rates. That liability stood at $33.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2015 for Chicago's four retirement systems. The mayor last year pushed through a $543 million phased-in property tax increase for police and firefighter retirement systems. The city enacted a new tax on water and sewer usage last month to rescue its largest pension fund for municipal workers from insolvency.
A Chicago-based government finance watchdog group welcomed Emanuel's budget blueprint on Tuesday. ""Generally, our initial reaction to the mayor's plan is this is a good-news budget for the city of Chicago,"" said Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation.Emanuel's top city council ally, Alderman Patrick O'Connor, said the mayor is making solid progress in digging Chicago out of its fiscal and social mess. But no one is saying it yet amounts to a platform for a possible third term in 2019, which the mayor has not yet ruled out.""There are ebbs and flows to popularity. There are ebbs and flows to crisis,"" O'Connor said. ""Who knows what the crisis of the day is going to be a year from now or two years from now?"" (Editing by Matthew Lewis)"

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reiterated his promise in Sunday's debate to kill the ""carried interest"" tax loophole that benefits hedge fund managers and others - but his tax plan offers other goodies for Wall Street, a nonpartisan tax research group said on Tuesday.Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton's tax plans differ like mirror images, especially when it comes to how they treat investment fund managers and other wealthy Americans, according to separate reports by the Tax Policy Center.Trump's tax plan would reduce federal tax revenues by $6.2 trillion over a decade, with about three-quarters of the decrease coming from lower business taxes, the center said. Those with incomes in the top 0.1 percent would see an average tax cut of nearly $1.1 million. Clinton would raise revenue by $1.4 trillion almost entirely through higher taxes on the wealthy, including a 4 percent surcharge on those with incomes of more than $5 million.The Clinton campaign said the analysis showed she would require ""the wealthy, Wall Street and large corporations to pay their fair share.""     
The Trump campaign denounced it as ""a fraudulent analysis"" plagued by software problems.The Wall Street carried interest loophole allows financial managers at private equity, hedge fund and other qualifying firms to pay a capital gains tax rate on their income instead of the higher income tax rate.Clinton would close the loophole with no compensating benefits for those hit, the center said.
Under Trump's proposal, the center said hedge funds and private equity partnerships would qualify for a special 15 percent business tax rate, depending on their size, the center said. That would be well below Trump's proposed top income tax rate of 33 percent and less than the 23.8 percent rate that funds now pay under carried interest rules.""Literally, he is getting rid of carried interest,"" said Eric Toder, co-director of the center, which is a collaboration of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.
""The question is what else is there in the plan that affects hedge funds, and the reduction in the business income tax rate to 15 percent gives them a much better deal,"" Toder said.Large investment fund managers would lose any advantage because the Trump plan would subject them to an additional 20 percent dividend tax, the center said. Analysts said Trump had not said what constitutes a large business.""Our plan has explicit safeguards to keep hedge funds from abusing the business rate - it's Hillary who plans secret benefits for Wall Street, not us,"" Trump national policy director Stephen Miller said in a statement.

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to decide whether to block a lawsuit against former Attorney General John Ashcroft and others by non-U.S. citizens, mainly Muslims, swept up after the Sept. 11 attacks who said they were abused in detention.The senior officials under former President George W. Bush, also including former FBI Director Robert Mueller and Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner James Ziglar, have asked the justices to reverse a 2015 lower court ruling allowing the long-running suit to proceed.The civil rights lawsuit seeks to hold the former officials responsible for racial and religious profiling and abuse in detention that the plaintiffs said they endured after being detained following the 2001 attacks by al Qaeda Islamic militants on the United States.The brief order said two justices, liberals Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, will not participate, meaning only six justices will hear the case. The court remains one justice short following Antonin Scalia's February death.The suit was filed by a group of Muslim, Arab and South Asian non-U.S. citizens who, their lawyers said, were held as terrorism suspects based on their race, religion, ethnicity and immigration status and abused in detention before being deported.
They were charged only with civil immigration violations. But the plaintiffs said they were subjected at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center to 23-hours-a-day solitary confinement, strip searches, sleep deprivation, beatings and other abuses and denied the ability to practice their religion.They said their rights under the U.S. Constitution to due process and equal protection under the law were violated.The plaintiffs include Benamar Benatta, an Algerian Muslim who was seeking refugee status in Canada, and Ahmed Khalifa, an Egyptian Muslim who said he was on vacation.
During the U.S. Justice Department's massive investigation after the 2001 attacks, certain immigrants in the country illegally were detained until being cleared of Sept. 11 involvement.The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Ashcroft, Mueller and Ziglar could be sued, based on a 1971 Supreme Court ruling. In 2013, a judge had dismissed the claims against them but allowed some against detention facility wardens.Ashcroft and Mueller are represented by the Justice Department, which asked the justices to hear the appeal. Government lawyers say there is no proof Ashcroft or Mueller personally condoned any potential unconstitutional actions.
The court will hear arguments and rule by the end of June.In a similar previous case, the Supreme Court in 2009 backed Ashcroft, saying a lawsuit by detainees failed to contain specific details on Ashcroft's involvement. (Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)"
