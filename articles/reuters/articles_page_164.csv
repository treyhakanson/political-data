By Emily Stephenson and Noeleen Walder

Republican White House hopeful Donald Trump is seeking $10 million in damages from a fired former employee, shedding light on a campaign that has at times seen high-profile exits and internal fights spill over into public view.Trump in May started arbitration proceedings against Sam Nunberg, a former adviser who was fired in 2015, accusing him of violating a confidentiality agreement, according to a court filing obtained by Reuters.    ""He has a confidentiality agreement which he has repeatedly breached, and we've taken action to enforce it,"" said Alan Garten, general counsel with the Trump Organization who is representing the campaign in the arbitration. Nunberg did not respond to a request for comment.The flare-up comes after a period in which campaign in-fighting led Trump to fire some top aides, including national political director Rick Wiley and campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Other staffers have separately resigned from Trump's campaign.Trump's legal conflicts, which also include a lawsuit over his Trump University real-estate seminars, have at times distracted public attention from his campaign.
Nunberg in court documents dated Tuesday accused Trump of starting arbitration proceedings to retaliate against him for switching his support to rival presidential hopeful Ted Cruz during the Republican primaries. Cruz dropped out of the race in early May.Garten said the suit was unrelated.Nunberg also said Trump tried to use the arbitration to ""cover up media coverage of an apparent affair"" between two members of his presidential campaign staff.
""The Trump campaign is attempting to bring a frivolous and retaliatory arbitration proceeding against me essentially to punish me and shut me up,"" Nunberg said in an affidavit accompanying his petition to halt the arbitration proceedings. The petition was filed on Tuesday in New York state court in Manhattan. The Trump campaign fired Nunberg in August 2015 after the discovery of Facebook posts that critics deemed racist. Nunberg at the time denied he wrote the posts.He said in the court filings that Trump accused him of being the source for a New York Post story in May that recounted a public argument between Lewandowski, who was then with the campaign, and Hope Hicks, Trump's spokeswoman.
In the affidavit, Nunberg said the argument was part of an ""sordid and apparently illicit affair"" between the two. He denied being the source for the New York Post story, saying the argument occurred in public and others saw it.Garten called the allegation ""categorically untrue"" and said Nunberg had recently asked for his job back.""This is an individual who time and time again has demonstrated that he will say anything that is outrageous, regardless of whether it's factually accurate, to get his name out there and create trouble,"" Garten said.Hicks and Lewandowski did not respond to requests for comment.

WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate on Wednesday approved a bill that would upgrade security at U.S. airports in the aftermath of the Brussels and Istanbul attacks while extending funds for the Federal Aviation Administration for another 14 months.In an 89-to-4 vote, the lawmakers sent the legislation on to the White House for President Barack Obama's signature. The House of Representatives approved the same measure on Monday.It includes provisions that require tougher vetting of aviation workers with access to secure airport areas, expedited security checks to move passengers more quickly from airport areas that are not secured and a larger number of police dogs for security duty in the U.S. transportation system.It extends the current level of federal funding for FAA programs through September 2017.
Congress has been struggling to find agreement on a more comprehensive package to reauthorize the U.S. aviation regulatory agency. A measure that would have provided FAA funding over six years stalled in the House earlier this year, amid disagreement over a proposal to privatize the U.S. air traffic control system.The House later failed to take up a Senate reauthorization bill but added security features from that measure into the legislation approved this week.
House Republicans say they intend to use the time between now and September 2017 to find ways to move the privatization plan forward. 
A Turkish court has jailed seven suspects pending trial on terrorism charges over last month's triple suicide bombing at Istanbul's main airport. The attack killed 45 people. Islamic State suicide bombers killed 16 people at Brussels airport - as well as 16 on a Brussels metro train - on March 22 this year. (Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Alistair Bell)"

WASHINGTON A U.S. House of Representatives panel on Wednesday issued subpoenas to the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts to force them to submit information on their investigations into whether Exxon Mobil misled investors on climate change risks, accusing the attorneys general of having a political agenda. The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology also subpoenaed eight environmental and legal groups.""The attorneys general have appointed themselves to decide what is valid and what is invalid regarding climate change,"" committee Chair Lamar Smith, a Republican of Texas, said.He said the attorneys general are pursuing a political agenda at the expense of scientists' right to free speech.The panel has demanded that state attorneys general hand over any records of consultations the prosecutors had with outside environmental groups before their probes were opened.New York and Massachusetts' top lawyers lead a coalition of 17 state attorneys general who have said they would investigate Exxon and whether its executives misled the public by contradicting research from company scientists that spelled out the threats of global warming.   
Smith and Republican members of the House panel have accused the coalition's members of stifling free speech and scientific inquiry by those who do not believe in manmade climate change.""I don't know what we will find,"" Smith told reporters. ""We might find an intent to intimidate."" So far, New York and Massachusetts have issued subpoenas against Exxon Mobil, one of the world's largest publicly traded companies. 
The House committee twice demanded that the state attorneys general hand over all records of communications between their offices and outside groups about Exxon inquiries.Darin LaHood, a Republican of Illinois on the panel, said on Wednesday that the probe by the attorneys general prohibits free speech in a way ""you would see in a third world country.""Cyndi Roy Gonzalez, the spokeswoman for the Massachusetts attorney general's office, said in a statement that Smith's committee has no right to interfere with ""... a state inquiry into whether a private company violated state laws, and we will continue to fight any and all efforts to stop our investigation.""
Green groups Greenpeace and 350.org made similar criticisms in a letter to Smith.Exxon, which has said that it has acknowledged the reality of climate change for years, called the subpoena unreasonably burdensome and intrusive. It also raised questioned about jurisdiction. The attorneys general and the groups have two weeks to respond. (Reporting by Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Leslie Adler)"

WASHINGTON Republican Donald Trump pulled ahead of Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton in Florida and Pennsylvania in a Quinnipiac Poll released on Wednesday that included responses after the FBI released its findings on Clinton's email use.Clinton lost ground on honesty and moral standards in the poll that showed tight races in Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio, all swing states that could go to either party in November's presidential election.The Quinnipiac Poll, taken from June 30 to July 11, showed Trump competitive in the three states a week before the start of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland that will formally nominate him as the party's presidential candidate for the Nov. 8 election.Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the poll, said there was no definite link between Clinton's drop in Florida from Quinnipiac's June 21 survey and the FBI's findings that she was careless in her handling of government emails while U.S. secretary of state.But he said Clinton lost ground to Trump on questions that measure moral standards and honesty.
Clinton lost an 8-point lead in Florida, where Trump won 42 percent to Clinton's 39 percent, according to the Quinnipiac Poll. In Ohio, the poll showed the candidates tied at 41 percent. In Pennsylvania, the Quinnipiac poll showed Trump with 43 percent to Clinton's 41 percent.A NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released this week showed a very different result in Pennsylvania, with Clinton leading Trump 45 to 36 percent. The July 5-10 poll included 829 registered voters and has a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
Nationally, Clinton leads Trump by 13 percentage points, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday. The online poll showed that 46 percent of likely voters support Clinton while 33 percent support Trump. The July 8-12 included 1,146 likely voters and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.FBI Director James Comey said last week Clinton was ""extremely careless"" in the handling of classified information but the investigation found no evidence she or her colleagues intended to violate laws.
Clinton, a former U.S. senator and first lady, has faced heavy criticism from Republicans for her use of private email servers for government business while she led the State Department from 2009 to 2013.The Quinnipiac poll was conducted by telephone with people who identified as registered voters. It included 1,015 people in Florida, 955 people in Ohio and 982 people in Pennsylvania. The margin of error was around three percentage points in all three states.

Former Democratic Senator and Indiana Governor Evan Bayh announced on Wednesday that he will come out of retirement to run for the U.S. Senate, a move that could determine whether Democrats can take control of the upper chamber in November. ""With the challenges facing Indiana and our country, I can no longer sit on the sidelines and watch as partisan bickering grinds Washington to a halt,"" Bayh said in a statement announcing his candidacy. Bayh served two terms in the Senate before announcing his retirement in 2010. He has maintained a campaign account with more than $9.2 million cash on hand. The Republican candidate, Todd Young, has a campaign account with more than $1 million.
Fellow Democrat Baron Hill cleared the way for Bayh to run on Monday when he announced that he was leaving the Senate race.
The Democratic Party needs a net gain of four Senate seats to take control of the 100-member chamber in the Nov. 8 election.

WASHINGTON U.S. Republican presidential contender Donald Trump called on Wednesday for the resignation of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, describing her as mentally unfit after she lambasted him in a series of media interviews.""Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me,"" Trump said in a Twitter post. ""Her mind is shot - resign!"" The New York billionaire chided Ginsburg, 83, for criticizing him this week and expressing concern for the country's future if he is elected in November.Trump said it was inappropriate for Supreme Court justices to weigh in on political campaigns. He told the New York Times on Tuesday that he thought it was a disgrace to the court and that Ginsburg should apologize to her colleagues on the bench. Trump was not alone in the rebuke. In an editorial on Wednesday, the New York Times urged Ginsburg to uphold the court's tradition of silence in political campaigns.""Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg needs to drop the political punditry and the name-calling,"" the editorial said. The Times said there was no legal requirement that Supreme Court justices keep silent on political campaigns, but it expressed concern that Ginsburg would jeopardize her own commitment to impartiality.
Ginsburg was not immediately available for comment on Trump's remarks and the editorial.In a CNN interview posted on Tuesday, Ginsburg called Trump ""a faker.""""He has no consistency about him,"" she said. ""He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego.

By Ned Parker

The New Black Panther Party, a ""black power"" movement, will carry firearms for self-defense during rallies in Cleveland ahead of next week's Republican convention, if allowed under Ohio law, the group's chairman said. The plan by the group this weekend comes as police in Cleveland brace for an influx of groups that plan demonstrations before and during the presidential nominating convention. During the attack last week in Dallas that killed five police officers, law enforcement officials said demonstrators carrying rifles led them to initially believe they were under attack by multiple shooters.Several other groups, including some supporters of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, have said they will carry weapons in Cleveland.""If it is an open state to carry, we will exercise our second amendment rights because there are other groups threatening to be there that are threatening to do harm to us,"" Hashim Nzinga, chairman of the New Black Panther Party, told Reuters in a telephone interview.  ""If that state allows us to bear arms, the Panthers and the others who can legally bear arms will bear arms.""Nzinga said he condemned the Dallas shootings.Officials in Ohio have said it will be legal for protesters to carry weapons at demonstrations outside the convention under that state's ""open carry"" law, which allows civilians to carry guns in public. 
""Black power"" groups promote defense against racial oppression, with some advocating for the establishment of armed self-defense groups, black social institutions and a self-sufficient economy.The New Black Panther Party has long called for a separate black nation. But Nzinga said the movement was now focused on protecting black Americans' rights.Academics say the New Black Panther Party remains marginal and largely representative of an older generation, in their 30s and 40s, rather than younger activists drawn to groups such as the anti-racism Black Lives Matter movement.The New Black Panther Party was founded in 1989 and adopted a more radical approach than the 1960s Black Panther Party. Members of the original group have denounced the New Black Panther Party as racist, but Nzinga says his movement includes original Black Panthers.The Southern Poverty Law Center, a hate group watchdog, describes the New Black Panther Party as ""a virulently racist and anti-Semitic organization whose leaders have encouraged violence against whites, Jews and law enforcement officers.""
The center tracks years of public statements by the New Black Panther Party and other groups. Nzinga denied the group was racist but said it was a fact that Jews control Hollywood and the U.S. media.The center said the group is not known to have carried out any violent attacks. The black shooter in the Dallas killings ""liked"" the New Black Panthers and other black nationalist groups on Facebook but was not a member.  ""THERE TO PROTECT""

Nzinga said he expected ""a couple hundred"" members of the New Black Panther Party to participate in and protect a black unity rally -- the ""National Convention of the Oppressed"" -- that is scheduled to begin in Cleveland on Thursday evening and end on Monday morning. Nzinga said he and the Panthers plan to leave Cleveland on Sunday, the day before the convention officially opens. ""We are there to protect ... We are not trying to do anything else,"" he said. ""We are going to carry out some of these great legal rights we have -- to assemble, to protest and (to exercise) freedom of speech.""Nzinga says his group has grown amid racial tensions in the wake of a series of high-profile police killings of black men in the past two years. The Southern Poverty Law Center says the number of black militant chapters around the country grew from 113 in 2014 to 180 in 2015. The center says there are 892 hate groups total nationwide. It says white hate groups, such as the Aryan Brotherhood, have a much longer track record of carrying out violent attacks than black nationalist groups.Nzinga said his group has 36 chapters nationwide but declined to reveal membership numbers.""I have people literally calling me saying this is the first time in my life I protested and I loved it."" Nzinga told Reuters. ""They want to be a part of something. They tried to be a part of the system and the system let them down so they want to be part of a rebellion.""

By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton extended her lead over Republican rival Donald Trump to 13 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday, up from 10 points at the end of last week.The July 8-12 poll showed 46 percent of likely voters supported Clinton, the former secretary of state, while 33 percent supported Trump, a celebrity real estate developer. Another 21 percent did not support either candidate.That compared with 45 percent who supported Clinton and 35 percent who supported Trump in the five days to July 8. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has mostly led in the national online poll this year. The last time Trump came close to Clinton's popularity was in early May, when his last two rivals for the Republican nomination dropped out of the race and party leaders started to line up behind his campaign.
Trump, who is expected to become the official Republican nominee at the party's convention next week, has since lost ground in the poll as he struggled to refocus his campaign from the Republican nominating contests to the Nov. 8 general election. Over the past several weeks, Trump has faced criticism for his past business dealings and has quarreled with Republican leaders over his rejection of international trade agreements and his promises to crack down on immigration.Clinton, meanwhile, has been dogged by criticisms of how she handled classified information as secretary of state. 
James Comey, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said last week that Clinton and her staff were ""extremely careless"" with sensitive information but recommended that the government not seek criminal charges against her. Still, Americans have become increasingly positive about Clinton this month, with half of likely voters now saying they have a favorable view of her, according to the poll, up from 46 percent on July 1.
Some 60 percent of likely voters have an unfavorable view of Trump, compared with 58 percent on July 1.The Reuters/Ipsos poll surveyed 1,146 likely voters across the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points. (Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Leslie Adler)"

By Amanda Becker
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign is vetting retired Navy Admiral James Stavridis as a potential vice presidential running mate, a source with knowledge of the process told Reuters on Tuesday.Stavridis is dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University near Boston and a former supreme allied commander of NATO. ""Admiral Stavridis is one of the finest military officers of his generation,"" Michele Flournoy, a former under secretary at the U.S. Department of Defense, told Reuters in a statement.""He is a person of great ability and integrity, and an exceptional leader. He has the talents, experience, judgment and temperament to serve the American people at the highest levels of our government.""The Clinton campaign declined to comment on the vetting of Stavridis. Stavridis likewise declined to comment on the process.Flournoy, who formed a think tank after leaving the Defense Department and is advising the Clinton campaign on foreign policy, also did not comment on the vetting process.
Flournoy is thought to be a probable Clinton pick for defense secretary if the presumptive Democratic nominee wins the White House on Nov. 8.Stavridis and Clinton worked closely together when he was at NATO and she led the U.S. State Department during Democratic President Barack Obama's first term.Introducing Clinton at a 2013 awards dinner, Stavridis said, ""She does the work of two, of 20, of 200 with her energy, with her enthusiasm and with her boundless determination to improve our world,"" and praised her use of ""smart power.""In a 2012 TED talk on global security, Stavridis began by saying: ""My thesis for us today is, instead of building walls to create security, we need to build bridges.""
Clinton has used similar rhetoric about the role of international diplomacy on the campaign trail.Stravidis was senior military assistant to former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in the George W. Bush administration during the early years of the U.S. occupation of Iraq. That could provide presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump with a line of political attack. Trump has throughout the campaign criticized Clinton for, as a U.S. senator, voting in favor of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Trump expressed early concerns about the operation's cost.
Another political millstone could be a 2012 Defense Department inspector general's report that said Stavridis had failed to obtain prior authorization to use a government aircraft during an unofficial trip and submitted improper travel expenses. Stavridis was cleared of misconduct.Stavridis would bring military heft to Clinton's presidential ticket. Trump is considering Michael Flynn, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, for the No. 2 spot.Flynn, a Democrat who is nonetheless fiercely critical of Obama's foreign policy, would be an unconventional choice for Trump. The wealthy New York businessman is formally vetting former U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Other potential vice presidential picks said to be on Clinton's short list are U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tim Kaine of Virginia, according to news reports. Clinton campaigned alongside Warren in Ohio last month and is set to campaign with Kaine in his home state on Thursday. Her campaign has not confirmed that either is being formally vetted.
