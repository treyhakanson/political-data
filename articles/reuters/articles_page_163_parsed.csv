By Andrea Shalal
| FARNBOROUGH, England

FARNBOROUGH, England The U.S. Air Force has developed a new framework for assessing the resilience of its satellites that should allow it to start the acquisition process for more military communication and missile detection satellites this autumn, a senior official said at the Farnborough Airshow this week.Lockheed Martin, Boeing Co, Northrop Grumman Corp and Raytheon Co are keeping a close eye on these satellite programs, which could be worth billions of dollars and represent the first big new business opportunities in the military space market for some time.U.S. officials have grown increasingly concerned about the need to protect their military satellites - which are critical to being able to identify targets, navigate, communicate and operate drones - given the growing use of electronic jammers and other threats.Winston Beauchamp, the U.S. Air Force deputy undersecretary for space, told Reuters that officials had developed a new set of criteria over the past year to help military leaders determine their options for more satellites.
The Air Force had previously looked at the options for follow-on satellites in both programs but until now had not included specific criteria for their resilience, or their ability to operate in the face of ""hostile action or adverse conditions,"" such as electromagnetic interference.Beauchamp said senior Pentagon leaders last week endorsed the work done so far on the framework and further work planned before it is presented to Defense Secretary Ash Carter for approval in the fall.
Once that decision is made, the Air Force hopes to begin the long-awaited acquisition process to buy follow-on satellites for the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system built by Lockheed Martin for protected satellite communications, and new missile warning satellites, also currently built by Lockheed under the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) program.Work was already underway on the acquisition strategy for each of the two programs so they could begin shortly after the resilience decision this autumn, Beauchamp said.
The U.S. Air Force was also focused on increasing coordination and planning among allies for its space operations, as well as more multilateral wargaming and work on developing rules of engagement and joint concepts of operations.""We are thinking more broadly about how to conduct operations in a joint manner,"" Beauchamp said. ""In the past it was tacked on at the end. But we'd like to find a way to shift the planning to the left in a number of areas."" (Editing by Greg Mahlich)"	[]	[]

A Tennessee state lawmaker was accused of inappropriate sexual conduct with 22 women over a four-year period in a state attorney general's report released on Wednesday. Republican Representative Jeremy Durham repeatedly made unwelcomed advances toward female legislative staff, interns and lobbyists since being elected in 2012, according to a report issued to a legislative committee investigating his conduct.Durham declined to be interviewed by investigators, the report said, and he was not immediately available for comment.""The investigation has been a politically motivated, unfair and unconstitutional process,"" said Durham's attorney Bill Harbison in a statement to the Nashville CBS affiliate News Channel 5.
The report details interviews with 22 unnamed women who described numerous occasions when the married legislator flirted and made suggestive sexual comments or physical advances toward them. In one case, Durham had sex with an 20-year-old campaign worker in his legislative office and again in his home. On several occasions, he sent text messages or used social media to make ""inappropriate"" comments to several women. 
One of the women described the messages as ""terribly inappropriate"" while another said his behavior ""creeped her out.""A lobbyist told investigators that Durham suggested he would vote for a bill she was promoting if she entertained his advances. ""I'm for your bill but I'm going to expect something in return,"" he told her according to the report. 
In a memo attached to the report, the committee said it will leave Durham's fate to the voters as he is up for re-election in November.  (Reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee; Editing by Tom Heneghan)"	[]	[]

By Jonathan Landay
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON CIA Director John Brennan said on Wednesday he would resign if the next president ordered his agency to resume waterboarding suspected militants, an apparent reference to comments by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump embracing the banned interrogation method.""I can say that as long as I'm director of CIA, irrespective of what the president says, I'm not going to be the director of CIA that gives that order. They'll have to find another director,"" said Brennan, who did not mention Trump by name.Brennan, who has been director since 2013, tacked his comment to the end of his response to a question about drone strike policy after speaking at the Brookings Institution, a Washington policy institute.Brennan said previously he would refuse to resume the practice, which simulates drowning and was used by the CIA on three suspected militants detained in secret foreign prisons during President George W. Bush's administration.But his pledge to resign if ordered to revive waterboarding was his most emphatic affirmation of his position to date.Trump, set to be formally nominated next week as the Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election, has said he would reauthorize waterboarding immediately if elected, contending that ""torture works.""
At an April 20 rally in Indianapolis, he recalled being asked about waterboarding during a debate the previous week.""They asked me: 'What do you think about waterboarding, Mr. Trump?' I said I love it. I love it, I think it's great. And I said the only thing is, we should make it much tougher than waterboarding,"" he said.Democratic President Barack Obama signed an executive order after taking office in January 2009 that banned waterboarding and other ""enhanced interrogation techniques,"" or EITs. Such executive orders can be rescinded by a president's successors.
Obama, other top U.S. officials, many lawmakers and human rights groups have denounced waterboarding as torture.Some former Bush administration and CIA officials have defended waterboarding and other EITs, denying they are torture and saying they elicited valuable intelligence.
Brennan told his confirmation hearing in 2013 he had not tried to stop harsh interrogation techniques such as waterboarding when he was at the spy agency earlier in his career, but had objected to them privately.A Senate Intelligence Committee study, issued in 2014, concluded that EITs failed to elicit any significant intelligence.Brennan said on Wednesday it was not possible to ""establish cause and effect"" between the use of EITs and the acquisition of reliable information.

By Amanda Becker

In a speech weighted with America's complicated racial history, Democrat Hillary Clinton laced into Republican presidential rival Donald Trump on Wednesday, accusing him of fueling divisions among Americans over race and religion.""His campaign is as divisive as any we have seen in our lifetimes,"" Clinton said at a campaign appearance at the Illinois state house in Springfield. ""It is built on stoking mistrust and pitting American against American. It's there in everything he says and everything he promises to do as president.""Clinton ticked off Trump's proposals to ban Muslims from entering the country, create a database of Muslims already in the country and step up deportations by creating a special deportation force as policies intended to drive Americans apart. She lambasted Trump's decision to re-tweet an image from a neo-Nazi and his statements about women.""We need a president who can help pull us together, not split us apart,"" Clinton said.The two presumptive nominees are heading into July nominating conventions where they are to formally become the Democratic and Republican candidates who will square off in the Nov. 8 presidential election.
Clinton's speech comes a week after a sniper shot and killed five Dallas police officers during a protest of police killings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota. She addressed these incidents and other race-related deaths in Springfield.Clinton's speech on Wednesday carried the echo of history. The state house in the Illinois capital of Springfield was the site where President Abraham Lincoln delivered an anti-slavery speech during his campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1858, warning that ""a house divided against itself cannot stand."" As the 16th president of the United States, he went on to guide the country through most of the Civil War.Clinton acknowledged that while ""the challenges we face today do not approach those of Lincoln's time,"" the country's ""long struggle with race is far from finished."" 
The Illinois state house is also where President Barack Obama, the first African-American to hold the highest office in America, launched his first campaign for president in 2007.Trump spent months ""trying to discredit the citizenship and legitimacy of our first black president,"" Clinton said. 
Trump was loudly fixated on the issue of Obama's birthplace during the 2012 presidential campaign and had also suggested that Obama was a Muslim, despite clear evidence that the president was born in Hawaii and is a Christian.Clinton acknowledged that she has made some missteps on race. She faced early criticism from the Black Lives Matter movement for past statements, such as one in the 1990s, when she was first lady, calling violent minority youth ""super predators."" She told the Washington Post earlier this year that she ""shouldn't have used those words.""""As someone in the middle of a hotly fought political campaign I cannot stand here and claim that my words and actions haven't sometimes fueled the partisanship that often stands in the way of progress, so I recognize I have to do better, too,"" she added.

By Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama will sign legislation passed by Congress aimed at combating a nationwide epidemic of heroin and other opioid addictions, the White House said on Wednesday.After months of wrangling, the Senate voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday, 92-2, to pass the bill that has also been approved by the U.S. House of Representatives.The measure aims to help communities develop treatment and overdose programs at a time when fewer than half the estimated 2.2 million Americans who need help for opioid abuse are receiving it, according to the U.S. Centers for Human and Health Services.The White House said in a statement the bill ""falls far short"" of the necessary funding, but Obama would sign it ""because some action is better than none.""Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a leading proponent of the legislation, said that it marked ""the first time that we've treated addiction like the disease that it is, which will help put an end to the stigma that has surrounded addiction for too long.""While its passage marked a rare bipartisan effort in this election year, Democrats complained that it does not provide  enough resources to effectively address the drug problem.
""This bill is like a Hollywood movie set - something that appears real on the surface but has no substance and no life behind its facade,"" said Senator Charles Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democrat.U.S. deaths from drug overdoses hit a record high in 2014, propelled by abuse of prescription painkillers and heroin, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 28,000 people died from opioid overdose in 2014. At least half, HHS said, of those deaths involved a prescription opioid.
Among the common prescription drugs are oxycodone, hydrocodone, and fentanyl that are used for pain treatment.Heroin-related deaths have also increased sharply, more than tripling since 2010. In 2014, more than 10,500 people died from heroin, the agency said.The bill authorizes $181 million a year for new programs it creates.
Democrats said that with disagreements in Congress over next year's funding for HHS, it was uncertain whether the money contained in the bipartisan bill actually would be delivered. They called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, to back up this legislation with $600 million in immediate emergency funds. Obama has requested $920 million for opioid treatment programs over two years.The bill, if enacted into law, also would provide new training for emergency personnel in administering drugs to reverse opioid overdoses and help communities purchase those drugs.

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The House of Representatives passed legislation on Wednesday to block the purchase of ""heavy water"" from Iran, defying President Barack Obama's veto threat a year after the announcement of the landmark Iran nuclear agreement.The House passed the ""No 2H2O from Iran Act"" by 249-176, with support coming almost exclusively from Republicans, who hold a majority of seats in the chamber.Every congressional Republican, and a few of Obama's fellow Democrats, opposed the nuclear deal between Iran and the United States and other world powers announced last July 14 in which Tehran agreed to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for relief from crippling international sanctions.They argued that Obama was so eager to bolster his foreign policy legacy that he agreed to sanctions relief Iran did not deserve because it lied about its nuclear program, supported militant groups that attack U.S. allies and perpetrated human rights abuses.
Deal opponents have repeatedly introduced legislation that the administration sees as efforts to undermine the international agreement. Deal supporters said the agreement was the best way to defuse a dispute over Iran's nuclear program that threatened further Middle East destabilization.Heavy water is a non-radioactive byproduct from making nuclear weapons and nuclear energy. The Obama administration said in April the United States would buy $8.6 million worth of heavy water from Iran, angering Republicans who called it a subsidy of the country's nuclear program.The White House issued a threat on Monday to veto the bill, and two others the House is due to consider later this week.
Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, denied that the House measure would violate the landmark pact. He said it would deter Iran from producing heavy water by making its sale more difficult.Separately, two Senate Republicans and two Democrats said on Wednesday they would introduce their own Iran-related bill.
The measure introduced by Republicans Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Marco Rubio and Democrats Robert Menendez and Joe Manchin would expand sanctions for Iran's ballistic missile development, sanction transfers of conventional weapons to or from Iran and extend the Iran Sanctions Act.The Iran Sanctions Act, which imposed sanctions over Iran's missile development and support for terrorism, expires at the end of 2016. Lawmakers have been in discussions for months over the best way to address its renewal. (Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Peter Cooney)"	['Rubio', 'Manchin', 'Menendez', 'Deal', 'Obama']	[]

By Marty Graham
| SAN DIEGO

SAN DIEGO U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel said on Wednesday he would take more time to decide whether video excerpts of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump answering questions under oath about his Trump University seminars should be made public.Curiel is overseeing two class-action lawsuits in San Diego over the real estate seminar venture. A separate fraud case by New York state's attorney general is pending.Trump has suggested Curiel is biased against him because of his campaign rhetoric about illegal immigration. Curiel was born in Indiana but is of Mexican descent. 
On Wednesday, Trump's lawyers fought release of the videos, arguing that they would be exploited during the presidential campaign. ""There's all kinds of potential for mischief,"" Daniel Petrocelli, a lawyer for Trump, told Curiel. 
Jason Forge, a lawyer for the students who claim they were misled and defrauded by Trump University, said Petrocelli could not point to any particular harm if the videos are released since transcripts are already public.The lawsuits accuse Trump of bilking students who paid as much as $35,000 each to learn his real estate investment strategies. The students claim they learned little. Trump has claimed a majority of students were satisfied with the seminars.

WASHINGTON A group of conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives has filed a measure aimed at forcing a vote to impeach Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen, a newspaper reported on Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the plans by the House Freedom Caucus.Members of the group had told House Speaker Paul Ryan they would file a privileged resolution, effectively sidestepping leaders in the Republican-dominated chamber, if he did not agree to start impeachment proceedings in the House Judiciary committee, Politico reported. Ryan has declined to do so because of doubts the judiciary panel can make an impeachment case against Koskinen.Politico said Louisiana Representative John Fleming filed the motion.
Koskinen faces allegations from the judiciary panel of ignoring congressional subpoenas and misleading lawmakers. The accusations stem from a 2013 case in which Republican lawmakers said the IRS scrutinized more conservative groups than liberal organizations in applications for tax-exempt status.

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The Obama administration's plan to prevent American companies from shifting their headquarters overseas to avoid U.S. taxes is coming under fire from companies and banks that say it would be costly and cumbersome.At issue are proposed Treasury regulations to combat ""earnings stripping,"" a key goal for companies that carry out tax-avoiding mergers known as ""inversions"" to reincorporate abroad, if only on paper, to cut their taxes.The practice effectively shifts taxable earnings from U.S. operations to the redomiciled former American parent as debt interest payments that are tax deductible in the United States and subject to a lower income tax rate overseas. The Treasury Department is scheduled to hold a public hearing on the proposed changes on Thursday.The administration's proposals, which could be finalized within months, have already dampened interest in global mergers.
The proposals are backed by Democrats in Congress and academics as a responsible step to prevent corporations from exiting the U.S. tax system. Republicans say the measures overstep administration authority and could discourage foreign investment in the United States. Businesses and trade groups representing sectors ranging from bankers and retailers to manufacturers and oil producers said a Treasury proposal to end the deductions by reclassifying the debt as equity would disrupt operations and saddle businesses with new red tape.U.S. multinational Procter & Gamble Co warned Treasury the proposed rules would require countless changes throughout its corporate structure if myriad daily loans between affiliates were recharacterized as equity investments.
""It will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to monitor and administer,"" P&G's Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told the Internal Revenue Service in a letter before the regulatory comment period ended last week. He warned that the company would face pre-tax costs of $220 million to $340 million a year as a result of adverse tax consequences and burdens.
The regulations would also pose challenges for intercompany loans key to the financial services industry, according to Citicorp, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp, which filed a joint comment with the Treasury. ""A financial services group would face the choice between, on the one hand, staggering administrative complexities and a tax burden disproportionate to its true economic profit, and on the other hand, the imposition of crippling constraints on its ordinary business activities,"" said the banks, which seek an industry exemption.A Treasury spokeswoman said officials could respond to the feedback but added the department was moving ""swiftly"" to finalize regulations.
