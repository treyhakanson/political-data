By Alana Wise and David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ratcheted up tensions in his party on Tuesday by denying two leading figures, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator John McCain, support in their re-election bids.Trump told The Washington Post in an interview that he could endorse neither Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican, nor McCain, a U.S. senator from Arizona and a former Republican presidential nominee, as they face challenges in their states' primary contests ahead of the Nov. 8 general election.Both Ryan and McCain had criticized Trump's feud with the family of Army Captain Humayun Khan, who died in the line of duty in Iraq in 2004 and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for bravery after his death.The discord comes just two weeks after the Republican National Convention in Cleveland that formally nominated Trump for president.It is the latest rift in a party already frayed by internal dissent over its standard bearer, seen in stark relief at the convention where McCain was among high-level party members who essentially snubbed Trump by choosing not to attend. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, and former presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush also did not attend the convention.Trump has had a running dispute with Khizr and Ghazala Khan since they took the stage at last week's Democratic convention to cite their son's sacrifice and criticize Trump's proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States.The uproar has led many Republicans to distance themselves from Trump and voice support for the Khan family.   Trump, mirroring the language Ryan used about supporting the nominee before his eventual endorsement, told the newspaper he was ""not quite there yet"" on endorsing Ryan in next Tuesday's Wisconsin primary, and that he had ""never been there"" with McCain, who will be on the ballot in primary elections in Arizona later this month.McCain had a ""very friendly"" meeting with Trump's vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, on Tuesday in Arizona, where Pence was visiting, a McCain spokeswoman said. Trump said Ryan had sought his endorsement, but that as of now he is only ""giving it very serious consideration.""Ryan's campaign office quickly responded that ""neither Speaker Ryan nor anyone on his team has ever asked for Donald Trump's endorsement."" 
""And we are confident in a victory next week regardless,"" campaign spokesman Zack Roday said in a statement.  Ryan is favored to win against primary challenger Paul Nehlen, who Trump praised as running ""a very good campaign."" In a mid-July survey by Harper Polling, Ryan was ahead of Nehlen by nearly 50 points.Trump, a former reality TV star, has troubled many in the Republican establishment with his off-the-cuff, often insulting style, and controversial policies, including the proposed ban on Muslims and his plan to build a wall along the Mexican border to keep out illegal immigrants.President Barack Obama on Tuesday blasted Trump as unfit to be president and questioned why any Republican would support the New York businessman, who is seeking his first public office.""The question I think that they have to ask themselves is, if you are repeatedly having to say in very strong terms that what he has said is unacceptable: Why are you still endorsing him?"" Obama, a Democrat, said at a White House news conference with Singapore's prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong.
CONGRESSMAN ABANDONS TRUMP
The chorus of complaints against Trump grew on Tuesday.Representative Richard Hanna of New York became the first Republican in Congress to endorse Democratic nominee Hillary, although several other Republicans in Congress have said they will not support Trump.Hanna, who is retiring from the House of Representatives rather than seek re-election, said his decision was prompted by Trump's attacks on the Khan family. He called Trump ""deeply flawed in endless ways,"" ""unrepentant"" and ""self-involved.""New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Trump ally once viewed by Trump as a potential running mate, called criticisms of the Khan family ""inappropriate.""
Trump's son Eric told CBS News on Tuesday that his father's comments about the Khans have been ""blown hugely out of proportion.""    Trump has fallen behind Clinton in opinion polls made public since the parties held their nominating conventions last month.Clinton extended her lead over Trump to 8 percentage points, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, from 6 points on Friday. About 43 percent of likely voters favor Clinton, 35 percent favor Trump, and 9 percent picked ""other.""Trump also has trailed Clinton in fundraising. Clinton reported raising nearly $90 million in July for her campaign and the Democratic Party, with more than half the donations coming from new donors.Interviewed on the Fox Business television network, Trump brushed off billionaire investor Warren Buffett's blistering critique of his business acumen.Buffett, chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, scorned Trump's 1995 move to list Trump hotels and casino resorts on the New York Stock Exchange, saying the business lost money for the next decade and that a monkey would have outperformed Trump's company.Trump, who has said his business success qualifies him to lead the country, defended his record running his hotel and casino business in Atlantic City, New Jersey.""I had great timing. I got out,"" after seven years, he told the network  on Tuesday. ""I took a lot of money out of Atlantic City, which is what I'm supposed to do. I'm a businessperson.""

WASHINGTON Representative Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, a Tea Party favorite who often feuded with Republican leaders in the U.S. House, lost his bid for re-election in the party's primary contest, unofficial state results showed on Wednesday.Huelskamp, who was seeking a fourth term, won just 44 percent of Tuesday's vote in losing to political newcomer Roger Marshall, a physician who took 57 percent, according to the Kansas secretary of state's website.Marshall said Huelskamp had become an ineffective player in Washington after losing key committee positions in a stand-off with Republican leaders. Conservative political action committees spent heavily this year to defeat Huelskamp and support Marshall, who also was backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Huelskamp comes from a Kansas farm family and was elected to Congress in 2010 amid a wave of support from the Tea Party movement, which promotes smaller government and reduced federal spending and taxation. He repeatedly tangled with his House Republican leaders in pushing for a more conservative fiscal agenda. 
Huelskamp was a prominent member of the Freedom Caucus of House conservatives who have riled House Republican leadership. His battles with former House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner left him stripped of his House Budget and Agriculture Committee memberships, a blow to his farm-rich state.""Voters are looking for results from their Reps, not obstructionism,"" the Chamber of Commerce's political wing said in a tweet after the vote, calling Marshall an ""effective conservative.""
Huelskamp, in a post on Facebook overnight, said the race showed how big money from ""Washington power brokers"" had defeated Kansas values. ""It is now perfectly clear,"" he wrote, ""that the Establishment wing of the Republican party cannot stand conservatives,"" he wrote.
Marshall will face Libertarian candidate Kerry Burt in the Nov. 8 general election. There is no Democratic candidate, according to the Kansas secretary of state's website. (Reporting by Richard Cowan, Susan Cornwell and Susan Heavey; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Bill Trott)"	['Huelskamp']	[]

By Richard Cowan and David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Republican Donald Trump's presidential campaign appealed to Capitol Hill for support on Monday as his attacks on the Muslim parents of a decorated American soldier killed in Iraq drew sharp rebukes from fellow party members.Trump's criticism of Khizr Khan and Ghazala Khan, who took the stage at last week's Democratic convention, sparked growing concern and dismay from Republican lawmakers responding to the latest Trump outburst to blindside his party colleagues.Republican Senator John McCain, a former prisoner of war and the most prominent veteran in Congress, along with the commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, joined the chorus of condemnation, reflecting the highly regarded place the military and its veterans hold with many in the United States.Trump's dispute with the Khans has dominated the White House campaign in recent days and underlined the uneasy alliance between many leading Republicans and the party's freewheeling, unorthodox nominee for the Nov. 8 election.Rob Wasinger, a onetime congressional candidate who has been working for the Trump camp on congressional outreach, sent an email to senior Senate aides saying, ""We want to get several member statements out today on this, and would really appreciate your help.""A similar appeal was made to Republicans in the House of Representatives, according to a senior aide.Attached to the appeal were talking points lawmakers could use to try to tamp down the controversy growing since last week's appearance at the Democratic convention by the Khans, the parents of U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan, who was killed by a bomb in Iraq 12 years ago.Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, said that the campaign was grateful to have support in Congress and that Republicans are working to keep Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton from winning the presidency. Wasinger refused to comment when contacted by telephone.The appeal did not generate any help for Trump. A senior Senate Republican aide, who asked not to be identified, said Republican senators were pleased with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's statement on Sunday calling Captain Khan ""an American hero"" and noting ""a travel ban on all members of a religion is simply contrary to American values.""At the same time, the aide said the controversy would probably not cause Republican senators to withdraw their endorsements of Trump.In a convention speech delivered with his wife at his side, Khizr Khan showcased his son's military service and criticized Trump's call for a temporary ban on Muslims from entering the United States, holding up a copy of the U.S. Constitution and suggesting Trump read it.Since then, Trump has complained he was ""viciously"" attacked by the couple and suggested Ghazala Khan might not have been ""allowed"" to speak, implying her silence reflected restrictions placed on women by some traditional Muslims. McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential candidate and current chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued a lengthy statement sharply criticizing Trump's comments.
""While our party has bestowed upon him the nomination, it is not accompanied by unfettered license to defame those who are the best among us,"" said McCain, a prisoner of war for five years during the Vietnam War.His counterpart on the House Armed Services Committee, Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas, echoed McCain, saying in a statement he was ""dismayed at the attacks Khizr and Ghazala Khan have endured after they spoke about their son's service and sacrifice.""The head of the 1.7 million-member Veterans of Foreign Wars also said Trump's attack on the Khans went too far. Trump and Clinton spoke to the group's national convention last week.'NO TOLERANCE'
""Election year or not, the VFW will not tolerate anyone berating a Gold Star family member for exercising his or her right of speech or expression,"" said Brian Duffy, the national commander of the country's oldest and largest war veterans organization, referring to families who have lost relatives in wars.
President Barack Obama did not mention Trump by name, but said military families who had lost loved ones in service should be honored for their sacrifice.""No one has given more for our freedom and our security than our Gold Star families,"" Obama said at the Disabled American Veterans national convention in Atlanta. ""Our Gold Star families have made a sacrifice that most of us cannot even begin to imagine. They represent the very best of our country.""In the talking points sent to lawmakers, the Trump campaign said he had been asked about the Khans' comments during the convention and wished them well. The talking points also noted that Trump ""wants to end radical Islamic terror, so that our soldiers like Mr. Khan's son will be safe.""The list also says Trump had not directly compared his sacrifices to the Khans. Trump said over the weekend he had also made sacrifices in his life by working hard, creating jobs and being successful.The Khans bristled at that suggestion and, in numerous television appearances over the weekend, said Trump was ignorant about Islam and about their family's sacrifice.  Trump's off-the-cuff insults and controversial proposals such as the Muslim ban and a plan to keep illegal immigrants out by building a wall along the Mexican border, have made many in the party establishment reluctant backers of his White House bid.On Monday, during a town hall event in Columbus, Ohio, Trump told supporters he thought the November election might be ""rigged."" Later that day, he said former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders ""made a deal with the devil"" when he agreed to back Clinton. ""She's the devil,"" Trump said, referring to Clinton.
In his statement, McCain recalled how Humayun Khan died, saying that when a suicide bomber aimed his vehicle toward a building housing hundreds of U.S. soldiers, the captain told his subordinates to stay away, then ran toward it.McCain thanked the Khans for coming to America, saying ""your son was the best of America, and the memory of his sacrifice will make us a better nation - and he will never be forgotten."" In a remarks to television networks on Monday, Khizr Khan said Trump lacked the empathy to be a leader and chided him for throwing the first salvo in their exchange.Trump has tried to shift focus from the Khans.""This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!"" Trump said Monday on Twitter.Ghazala Khan wrote an opinion piece in The Washington Post on Sunday saying she had remained silent during her husband's remarks to cope with making her grief public during the convention.On Sunday, Democratic rival Clinton said Trump had scapegoated the parents. In addition to Senate Majority Leader McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan issued a statement supporting the family. Trump drew similar opprobrium a year ago when he said McCain, who as a naval aviator was shot down and taken prisoner during the Vietnam War, was not a hero because he had been captured.In an open letter, 23 Gold Star families said Trump cheapened their sacrifice and called for an apology.""This goes beyond politics. It is about a sense of decency,"" it said. ""That kind decency you mock as 'political correctness.'""

By Jeff Mason and Doina Chiacu
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama issued a scathing attack of Donald Trump on Tuesday for criticizing a Muslim family whose U.S. Army captain son was killed in Iraq, and he challenged Republican leaders to withdraw support for their ""unfit"" nominee.Obama's comments added to a growing number of statements from Republicans and Democrats lambasting Trump for his criticism of Khizr and Ghazala Khan, who appeared at the Democratic National Convention last week.Trump questioned whether Mrs. Khan did not speak at the convention because she was prevented from doing so by her religion and he characterized Mr. Khan's criticism of him as ""vicious.""Families who lose sons or daughters who serve in the U.S. military are called Gold Star families.""The notion that he would attack a Gold Star family that had made such extraordinary sacrifices on behalf or our country, the fact that he doesn't appear to have basic knowledge around critical issues in Europe, in the Middle East, in Asia means that he's woefully unprepared to do this job,"" Obama said of Trump during a White House news conference.
The Democratic president noted that leading Republicans, including Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, and one-time Republican presidential nominee John McCain, a U.S. senator from Arizona, had criticized Trump for his remarks but have stood by their endorsements of him.""The question I think that they have to ask themselves is, if you are repeatedly having to say in very strong terms that what he has said is unacceptable, why are you still endorsing him?"" Obama said. ""What does this say about your party that this is your standard-bearer?"" Obama said.
Obama spoke during a White House news conference with Singapore's prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong. Obama has endorsed his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president.
Obama said that even if he had lost his White House races in 2008 to McCain and in 2012 to former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, he would not have doubted their abilities to lead the country.That was not the case for Trump, a businessman from New York, Obama said.""There has to come a point at which you say, somebody who makes those kinds of statements doesn't have the judgment, the temperament, the understanding to occupy the most powerful position in the world,"" Obama said.

By Susan Heavey

WASHINGTON U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Tuesday brushed off billionaire investor Warren Buffett's blistering critique of his business acumen.""I don't care much about Warren Buffett,"" Trump said on the FOX Business television network Tuesday morning, a day after Buffett lashed out at Trump in a speech at a campaign rally for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.Buffett, a widely followed investor who is chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, scorned Trump's 1995 move to list Trump hotels and casino resorts on the New York Stock Exchange, saying it lost money for the next decade and that ""a monkey"" would have outperformed Trump's company.He also challenged Trump to release his tax returns, something the real estate mogul and television star has declined to do so far citing an Internal Revenue Service audit.Trump, who has held up his career in business as a qualification to lead the country, defended his record running his hotel and casino business in Atlantic City, New Jersey.
""I had great timing. I got out,"" after seven years, he told FOX Business on Tuesday. ""I took a lot of money out of Atlantic City, which is what I'm supposed to do. I'm a businessperson."" Trump said he ""did well in the good times in Atlantic City, but then times started going very bad."" Trump said he used to invest in U.S. stocks but got out because ""I don't like what I'm seeing at all,"" pointing to U.S. immigration policies, Syrian refugees and what he said were ""artificially low"" interest rates.
He also vowed to spend twice as much on U.S. infrastructure as Clinton, who has pledged $275 billion on rebuilding the nation's crumbling roads and bridges, among other structures.Trump, who has been criticized by fellow Republicans and others for responding too readily to opponents, declined to target Buffett personally for his comments: ""There's no counter-punch."" 
Buffett on Monday vowed to do ""whatever it takes"" to get out the vote in his congressional district in Nebraska, including driving voters himself to the polls to cast ballots. With Clinton by his side, Buffett told the crowd that his ""final straw"" was Trump's critical response to the Muslim parents of a decorated U.S. soldier killed by a bomb in Iraq 12 years ago. Buffett is No. 3 on Forbes magazine's list of the richest billionaires, with a net worth calculated at $60.8 billion.

SAN FRANCISCO A U.S. judge on Tuesday rejected Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's pretrial bid to throw out a lawsuit brought by Trump University students who said they were defrauded by its real-estate seminars.U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel said in a written ruling that there was a ""genuine issue of material fact"" as to whether Trump knowingly participated in a scheme to cheat the students, who paid up to $35,000 to learn Trump's real estate investing ""secrets"" from his ""hand-picked"" instructors.Curiel said there was extensive evidence Trump had not personally met, interviewed or selected Trump University instructors.In a July 22 hearing, Curiel tentatively denied the bid by Trump to dismiss the lawsuit in California, one of three over the defunct Trump University venture.
Trump's lawyers had argued that the lawsuit, filed in 2013 in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, should be dismissed because the New York real estate mogul, though personally involved in developing the concept and curriculum, relied on others to manage Trump University by the time the plaintiffs purchased seminars.Trump's lawyers claimed that references in marketing materials to ""secrets,"" ""hand-picked"" instructors or ""university"" were sales ""puffery"" and there was no evidence Trump intended to defraud students.
Separately, Curiel rejected an effort to make public video excerpts of Trump testifying under oath. Trump's lawyers had fought against the release of the excerpts, saying they would be exploited by the media and others during the presidential campaign.
Trump set off an uproar in May when he accused Curiel of being biased against him because of the candidate's pledge to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico. Curiel was born in Indiana and is of Mexican descent.

By Luciana Lopez and Amanda Becker
| NEW YORK/WASHINGTON

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON Three senior officials with the Democratic National Committee have resigned, the DNC said on Tuesday, amid a shake-up following a hack of thousands of emails that embarrassed the party just as it staged its national convention last week.The resignations of DNC Chief Executive Officer Amy Dacey, Communications Director Luis Miranda and Chief Financial Officer Brad Marshall were announced by interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile.Brazile, who took over the role after Debbie Wasserman Schultz stepped down last week, did not mention the hacks or give a reason for the resignations in a statement on the reorganization, but cast the changes as looking ahead to the U.S. general election on Nov. 8.The hack on the DNC emails stirred discord at the start of the party's convention in Philadelphia where Hillary Clinton formally accepted her party's presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election.
Some of the emails, which were published by WikiLeaks, showed party officials favoring Clinton over her rival for the nomination, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, during the primary contests.Brazile announced a transition team that she said would help to position the party for the general election and to prepare for an eventual permanent party chair.     Tom McMahon, a former executive director of the DNC, will lead the transition team, the statement said. Chief of Staff Brandon Davis will also continue in that role and will oversee DNC general election efforts, and strategist Doug Thornell will join as a senior adviser on an interim basis, it said.
Other Democratic Party systems have also been hacked. The FBI is investigating a cyber attack incident at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC, and a computer network used by Clinton's campaign was also hacked.The White House has declined to speculate on who was behind the hack of Democratic Party computers, referring to an ongoing investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
Cybersecurity experts and U.S. officials, however, have said they believed Russia engineered the release of the DNC emails to influence the presidential election. Clinton herself has blamed Russia for the hack.Russia's foreign ministry has called such accusations  insulting.
