BERLIN If U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump wins the election in November, it would be problematic for the entire world and encourage copycats in Europe, European Parliament President Martin Schulz told a German magazine.""Trump is not only a problem for the EU but also for the whole world,"" Schulz said in an interview with Der Spiegel published online on Thursday.""If a man who shows off by not having a clue and by saying that specialist knowledge is elitist rubbish ends up in the White House, a critical point will have been reached,"" said Schulz, a German center-left Social Democrat.
Such a scenario would mean that there is an ""obviously irresponsible man"" sitting in a position that demands the utmost sense of responsibility, Schulz said.
He added that he was concerned that Trump getting into power would spur on copycats in Europe. ""That's why I want Hillary Clinton to win.""

By James Oliphant
| FLINT, Mich.

FLINT, Mich. The pastor of a black church in Flint, Michigan, stopped Donald Trump on Wednesday in the midst of his remarks criticizing Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, and said the Republican presidential nominee was not invited to talk about politics.As Trump went after Clinton for her support of global trade deals, pastor Faith Green Timmons interrupted to tell Trump her church had not invited him to ""give a political speech.""""Oh, oh, OK, that's good,"" Trump responded, shuffling papers on his podium at Bethel United Methodist Church.He then made a few remarks about fixing Flint's drinking-water issues before departing.
Trump was visiting the city to view its water crisis first-hand and extend his recent outreach to African-American voters ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Polls show black voters largely favor Clinton.He held an event at a black church in nearby Detroit earlier this month and has pledged in recent speeches to help the black community, which he has described as being besieged by poverty and crime. 
During his remarks on Wednesday, the New York real estate developer was also challenged by some members of the crowd of about 50 people, including a woman who accused him of discriminating against black renters as a landlord in the 1970s.""No, I never would, never would,"" Trump replied.
Earlier in the day, he toured Flint's water-treatment plant, which has been shut down since lead was found in the water supply.Residents of Flint asked a federal judge on Wednesday to order bottled water or filters be provided to them to prevent further lead exposure, 2-1/2 years after the city's water supply was found to be contaminated.

By Matt Spetalnick
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The United States will give Israel $38 billion in military assistance over the next decade, the largest such aid package in U.S. history, under a landmark agreement signed on Wednesday.The deal, whose details were reported by Reuters earlier, will allow Washington's chief Middle East ally to upgrade most of its fighter aircraft, improve its ground forces' mobility and strengthen its missile defense systems, a senior U.S. official said.While the package constitutes the most U.S. military aid ever given to any country, it entails concessions by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to officials on both sides.Those include Israel's promise not to seek additional funds from Congress beyond what will be guaranteed annually in the new package, and to phase out a special arrangement that has allowed Israel to spend part of its U.S. aid on its own defense industry instead of on American-made weapons, the officials said.Nearly 10 months of drawn-out aid negotiations underscored continuing friction between President Barack Obama and Netanyahu over last year's U.S.-led nuclear deal with Israel's arch-foe Iran, an accord the Israeli leader opposed. The United States and Israel have also been at odds over the Palestinians.But the right-wing Netanyahu decided it would be best to forge a new arrangement with Obama, who leaves office in January, rather than hoping for better terms from the next U.S. administration, according to officials on both sides.A new pact now allows him to avoid uncertainties surrounding the next president, whether Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump, and to give Israel's defense establishment the ability to plan ahead.
Obama's aides wanted a new deal before his presidency ends, seeing it as an important part of his legacy. Republican critics accuse him of not being attentive enough to Israel's security, which the White House strongly denies, and of taking too hard of a line with the Israeli leader.""DANGEROUS NEIGHBORHOOD""
The $38 billion memorandum of understanding covers U.S. fiscal years 2019-2028 and succeeds the current $30 billion MOU signed in 2007, which expires at the end of fiscal 2018.
""Prime Minister Netanyahu and I are confident that the new MOU will make a significant contribution to Israel's security in what remains a dangerous neighborhood,"" Obama said in a written statement.The agreement was signed at the State Department by U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Shannon and by Jacob Nagel, acting head of Netanyahu's national security council.According to a White House ""fact sheet,"" the deal includes:
-annual payments of $3.3 billion in so-called foreign military financing-$500 million a year for Israeli missile defense funding, the first time this has been formally built into the aid pact.-A phasing-out of a special arrangement that for decades has allowed Israel to use 26.3 percent of the U.S. aid on its own defense industry instead of on American-made weapons.-Elimination of a longstanding provision that has allowed Israel to use about 13 percent of the U.S. aid to buy military fuel.-The funding will allow Israel to update ""the lion's share"" of its fighter aircraft, including purchasing additional F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Israel is scheduled to receive 33 F-35 aircraft, the first two of which will be delivered in December.

By Susan Heavey and Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Another U.S. Republican senator has moved closer to re-election while keeping some distance from Donald Trump, and experts say this suggests the party's presidential candidate may be having little down-ballot impact, at least at the primary stage. Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire still faces a tough general election challenge on Nov. 8 but she crushed a pro-Trump, Republican challenger in a primary contest on Tuesday, winning close to 80 percent of the vote.Ayotte has refused to endorse Trump although, like a number of Republicans, she has said she will vote for him.Some Republicans, such as Ohio Senator Rob Portman, have endorsed Trump but excluded him from their campaigns. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska won her primary in August although she had said she did not know whether she would vote for Trump.Trump, a New York businessman who has never held elected office, at first criticized Ayotte. Then he changed course early last month and endorsed her, along with fellow Republicans House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator John McCain.With Ayotte's victory, all incumbent Republican senators running for re-election have won their primaries this year. This is not uncommon but it is unusual for so many senators to hold their party's presidential nominee at arm's length. 
U.S. senators serve six-year-terms. One-third of the 100-member Senate faces voters every two years.The outcome so far shows some voters are distinguishing this year between Trump and the rest of the ballot, said Nathan Gonzales, editor of The Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report, a non-partisan newsletter. ""His impact has been less dramatic than what was initially expected, but there is still time for things to get worse for the Republican Party,"" Gonzales said in a telephone interview.""At a time when Republicans in presidential primaries basically rejected everybody from the status quo, they are not doing that in Senate or House primaries,"" Norman Ornstein, a political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, said by telephone.
Republicans are still worried that voters who do not like Trump will not turn out to vote for other Republicans in the general election on Nov. 8, Gonzales said. ""Is there a Trump drag (on down-ballot candidates)? There doesn't appear to be much of one,"" said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor at the non-partisan Cook Political Report.Ohio's Portman, who has not appeared with Trump on the campaign trail, easily beat his primary opponent and has opened up a lead over his Democratic challenger in the general election.
McCain and Ryan have had very public differences of opinion with Trump but they also prevailed in their primary races.Ayotte beat a field of four challengers in New Hampshire, receiving nearly 80 percent of the vote, according to election results posted online by the state. She must still take on Democratic New Hampshire Governor Maggie Hassan in the general election. Ayotte was leading Hassan by 52 percent to 44 percent in a Sept. 6-8 NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll, according to the website RealClear Politics.""I think you probably have a lot of people in the primary who were not going to pay as close attention to what she was saying about Trump,"" Ornstein said of Ayotte. ""In the fall it may be a different matter, as certainly Maggie Hassan is going to try to tie her to Trump.""

By Scott Malone
| BOSTON

BOSTON Americans blame political gridlock in Washington for the country's declining economic competitiveness and hold both Democrats and Republicans responsible, a Harvard Business School study released on Wednesday found.The study noted that U.S. gross domestic product grew at a rate of about 2 percent since 2000, well below the 3 to 4 percent average in the prior half-century. It said a range of factors including a complicated corporate tax code, tangled immigration system and aging roads contribute to the slow growth.  The study contends that factors including a growing wealth gap, declines in productivity growth and a rise in the number of working-age people neither employed nor seeking jobs show that the U.S. economy is becoming less competitive.A majority of the school's alumni surveyed said they believed the U.S. political system was hurting the economy. That view crossed party lines, with 82 percent of Republicans, 74 percent of independents and 56 percent of Democrats agreeing.""Only a minority of members of either party felt that their own party was acting in a way that supported economic growth,"" said Jan Rivkin, a professor at Harvard Business School and co-author of the report.
The survey did not ask whether respondents preferred Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump or Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.Some respondents worry that neither candidate for the White House could overcome gridlock in Washington, Rivkin said, adding ""Anyone elected into the current system would face pressure toward paralysis.""
A concurrent survey of the general public found smaller, but still significant, numbers blaming the political system for a languishing U.S. economy.Some 49 percent of Republicans, 38 percent of independents and 26 percent of Democrats at large said politics were hurting growth.The study contends partisan gridlock is preventing the federal government from tackling structural problems facing the U.S. economy, and suggested steps to address that gridlock. Among them: Changing rules that allow lawmakers to ""gerrymander"" districts to ensure one party's dominance; reforming campaign finance; setting term limits in the House and Senate, and eliminating party control of the federal legislative process. 
The study comes a day after the Census Bureau reported median household income surged 5.2 percent last year to $56,500, its highest since 2007.The surveys included responses from 4,807 alumni of Harvard Business School from May 3 through June 6 and 1,048 members of the general public polled June 10-26. The public survey had a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points, margin of error does not apply to the alumni survey as it was not a random sample.

By Kevin Murphy
| KANSAS CITY, Mo.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. Missouri lawmakers pushed through bills on Wednesday eliminating the need for permits to carry concealed weapons and requiring voters to show a photo identification before casting a ballot, overriding Democratic Governor Jay Nixon's vetoes of the bills.Both votes by the Republican-controlled state House and Senate reached the two-thirds majority required to enact legislation over the governor's veto.The weapons bill abolished a state law requiring a permit, training and background checks for people who want to carry a concealed weapon in the state. The House voted 112-41 to override Nixon's veto and the Senate voted 24-6.Supporters of the bill said it will make the state safer by allowing more residents to carry firearms in self-defense, while still banning certain criminals and mentally incompetent people from having a gun.
In vetoing the bill in July, Nixon said the measure struck an extreme blow to sensible safeguards against gun violence.Earlier on Wednesday, the state Senate voted 24-7 and the House 115-41 to override Nixon's veto of a bill requiring voters to produce a government-issued ID instead of less official identification such as a utility bill or bank check.The bill would not take effect until 2017, after this year's presidential election, and only if voters in November pass a state constitutional amendment in support of the new law. That is necessary because the Missouri Supreme Court ruled 10 years ago that such a statute violated the existing state constitution.
Courts in recent months have blocked voter ID laws passed in several states by Republican-led legislatures after civil rights groups argued the measures were discriminatory against poor and minority voters.In Missouri, voters without a photo ID can still vote if they sign an affidavit swearing that they lack any type of identification. However, election officials can take their picture, and steps must be taken to get a photo ID for later use, with the state covering the cost.Supporters of the bill said it will help prevent voter fraud.
""Why not have more certainty in the election process?"" Republican Representative Justin Alferman, the bill's main sponsor, said in a statement before the vote.Opponents had argued that the ID requirement places an undue burden on young, minority and low-income voters who tend to support Democratic candidates.""Putting additional and unwanted barriers between citizens and their ability to vote is wrong and detrimental to our system of government as a whole,"" Nixon said in explaining his veto.

By Amanda Becker
| WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.

WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. U.S. presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on Wednesday moved to show their medical fitness for the White House as Clinton released a letter from her doctor declaring her fit for the presidency and Trump taped a TV-segment about his well-being.Clinton, 68, is healthy and fit to serve as president and is currently recovering from non-contagious, bacterial pneumonia, her physician, Dr. Lisa Bardack, said in a letter about the Democratic nominee's medical condition released by the campaign.Trump, 70, knows he could stand to lose a few pounds but otherwise is in great health, campaign adviser Sarah Huckabee Sanders told MSNBC on Wednesday after the Republican nominee taped an episode of the ""Dr. Oz Show"" in New York that will air on Thursday.Bardack, in her letter about Clinton, wrote: ""She is recovering well with antibiotics and rest. She continues to remain healthy and fit to serve as President of the United States.""The announcements came as Clinton spent a third day resting at her home in Chappaqua, New York, after falling ill on Sunday morning as she left a Sept. 11 memorial in New York City. Video footage taken by a bystander showed Clinton becoming dizzy as she attempted to get into a waiting vehicle. Her campaign said later in the day that the former secretary of state had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday.Though senior aides knew about Clinton's diagnosis, the delay in public disclosure fueled criticism that she is prone to secrecy and fed unsubstantiated internet rumors that she is hiding a health issue.Bardack said Clinton's pneumonia was diagnosed after a chest scan on Friday and that she was prescribed a 10-day course of antibiotics. 
Bacterial pneumonia can be treated with antibiotics while viral pneumonia necessitates a different approach, according to Dr. Steve Simpson, acting director of the Division of Pulmonary Disease at the University of Kansas Hospital. Simpson has not evaluated or treated Clinton.Since bacterial pneumonia is not contagious, Clinton was at no risk of transmitting the infection at campaign and fundraising events before or after she was diagnosed. She is scheduled to return to the campaign trail on Thursday.Bardack said Clinton's cholesterol and blood pressure are within normal ranges. She had a normal mammogram and breast ultrasound and shows no signs of developing heart disease, which runs in her family. Clinton takes medication for an underactive thyroid, which has been stable for years, Clarinex for her allergies, a vitamin B12 supplement and the blood thinner Coumadin following a 2012 blood clot in her head.
In December 2012, as Clinton was near the end of her term as secretary of state, she fell at home and suffered a concussion, developing a blood clot shortly thereafter.Since then, Clinton's dosage of Coumadin has ""been adjusted as needed according to regular lab testing,"" Bardack said. After consultation with a specialist, a decision was made to not switch Clinton to a newer anticoagulation drug.Bardack had released a two-page assessment of Clinton's health in July 2015. Trump's campaign released a brief letter from his personal physician in December 2015 that said he was in ""astonishingly excellent"" health but did not provide detail about treatment or medications.Neither candidate has released the type of detailed or voluminous medical records provided by past presidential candidates such as U.S. Senator John McCain, who in 2008 allowed reporters to review 1,173 pages of medical records after concerns were raised about a cancer scare.
Trump's campaign has said he will release additional medical information to the public in the coming days.The ""Dr. Oz Show"" on Wednesday released a short clip of its Thursday segment with Trump. In it, Trump gives Dr. Mehmet Oz two letters showing the results of medical tests conducted last week. Huckabee Sanders said she did not see the summary Trump showed Oz, but ""he self-admitted he could lose a few pounds.""Trump weighs 267 pounds, according to media reports. That weight would mean Trump, like many Americans but few U.S. presidents, is considered medically obese, according to body mass index standards.Clinton's running-mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, 58, also released a physician letter on Wednesday. Dr. Brian Monahan, who oversees the Office of the Attending Physician in the U.S. Congress, said Kaine, as of his last physical last February, was in ""overall excellent health."" Monahan said Kaine was on no medications but recommended a vitamin D supplement.

By John Walcott
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Former Secretary of State Colin Powell revealed distaste for both U.S. presidential candidates, but leveled his most pointed criticism at Republican Donald Trump in hacked emails leaked by a group American intelligence officials suspect is linked to Russia.In an email to Reuters on Wednesday, Powell confirmed the authenticity of the thousands of hacked messages but declined further comment.In one of the leaked emails, Powell, a Republican, called Trump ""a national disgrace"" and an ""international pariah"" who allied himself with racists questioning whether President Barack Obama was born in the United States.""When Trump couldn't keep that up,"" Powell wrote in the hacked message, ""he said he also wanted to see if the (birth) certificate noted that he was a Muslim. As I have said before, 'What if he was?"" Muslims are born as Americans everyday.""As for Clinton, Powell said in another email that the Democratic former secretary of state was ""greedy"" and had ""unbridled ambition.""The new batch of leaked messages, some from as recent as late August, has renewed concern in Washington about hackers meddling on behalf of Russia in the Nov. 8 election and U.S. politics. The White House so far has refrained from publicly blaming the attacks on Russia. ""The United States has not made a formal determination in public about who may or may not be responsible,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters during a daily briefing.
The head of the Democratic National Committee said on Tuesday the organization had been hacked by Russian state-sponsored agents who were trying to influence the U.S. presidential election. Some committee documents were leaked in July.In one of the newly leaked messages, from Aug. 21, Powell, the first black U.S. secretary of state, derided Trump's attempt to attract African-American voters.Powell wrote to a friend: ""There is nothing he can say that will sway black voters so he might as well say it to white folks. He is at 1% black voters and will drop. He takes us for idiots. He can never overcome what he tried to do to Obama with his search for the birth certificate hoping to force Obama out of the Presidency. Or, demanding his school transcripts to see how he got into Harvard---(eg, affirmative action).""In the same message, Powell called Trump's claim that ""within four years he would have 95 percent of blacks voting for him a schizo fantasy.""
'SCREWS UP WITH HUBRIS'
In a July 24, 2014, email, however, Powell made clear his discomfort with Clinton, writing: ""I would rather not have to vote for her, although she is a friend I respect. A 70-year person with a long track record, unbridled ambition, greedy, not transformational""Clinton launched her second bid for the presidency in 2015.
In another email, Aug. 18, 2015, he wrote, using her initials, that: ""Everything HRC touches she kind of screws up with hubris.""In some of the thousands of messages posted on the website DCLeaks.com, which include several exchanges with Reuters reporters, the former top diplomat and retired four-star Army general also expressed his displeasure with the Clinton campaign's efforts to equate his use of an AOL email address with her installation of a private server in her home.After it was reported that Clinton had told FBI investigators that Powell had advised her to use a personal address, he lamented that what he called her ""minions"" were ""making a mistake trying to drag me in.""Former National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, who served with Powell in Republican George W. Bush's administration, agreed, writing to Powell that: ""I don't think Hillary's 'everyone did it,' is flying.""Powell was harsher in an Aug. 21 message to a friend and former aide, writing: ""Well, their email ploy this week didn't work and she once again looks shifty if not a liar. Trump folks having fun with her.""A Clinton campaign spokesperson declined to comment. Trump's campaign did not respond to a request for comment. The Association of State Democratic Chairs sent a message, obtained by Politico, to its members on Wednesday warning that hackers are targeting state party officials and have successfully breached and impersonated some of them.

""I misspoke by asserting that the RNC was hacked. What I had intended to say was that in addition to the DNC hack, Republican political operatives have also been hacked,"" said McCaul, a U.S representative from Texas.Reuters reported last month that hackers had targeted the computer systems of Republican Party organizations and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
