By Scott Malone

Officials in Florida and Virginia filed voter fraud charges against three people in apparently unrelated cases on Friday, just 11 days before American voters cast ballots in the hotly contested presidential race.The charges targeted a Florida woman and a Virginia man accused of filing bogus voter registration forms and a Florida woman 	alleged to have tampered with absentee ballots she was opening at the Miami-Dade Elections Department.In the Iowa capital of Des Moines, county election officials referred three cases of suspected voter fraud to police earlier this week, leading to one arrest on Thursday, police said.Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has charged in recent weeks that the election will be rigged in favor of Democrat Hillary Clinton, though he has shown no proof for these claims and many Republicans have called them unfounded.Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle in Florida said that 74-year-old Gladys Coego had been working as an absentee ballot opener when a supervisor allegedly saw her changing ballots that had been left blank to support a mayoral candidate. Prosecutors said that Coego admitted to marking the ballots and was charged with two felony counts of marking or designating the ballot of another.""The integrity of the electoral process is intact because our procedures work,"" said Christina White, the county's election supervisor, in a statement.
Tomika Curgil, 33, was charged with five felony counts of submitting false voter registration information for allegedly handing in forms filled out by fictitious voters while working on a voter-registration drive for a medical marijuana advocacy group.A Virginia man was also charged with submitting falsified forms while working for a voter-registration campaign, state prosecutors said.Vafalay Massaquoi, 30, was arraigned on two felony counts of forging a public record and two counts of voter registration fraud.
""There is no allegation that any illegal vote was actually cast in this case,"" said Virginia Commonwealth's Attorney Bryan Porter. ""Furthermore, since the fraudulent applications involved fictitious people, had the fraud not been uncovered, the risk of actual fraudulent votes being cast was low.""Neither Coego, Curgil nor Massaquoi could be reached for immediate comment.Police in Des Moines on Thursday arrested a woman who was accused of voting twice - casting early-voting ballots at two locations - in one of three cases of suspected voter fraud reported by the Polk County Auditor's Office.
Police did not disclose the political affiliation of the woman, identified as Terri Lynn Rote, 55, but the Des Moines Register newspaper reported she was a registered Republican.A man in Texas, where early voting started on Monday, was arrested on Monday on charges of electioneering and loitering near a polling place, public records show. The man, Brett Mauthe, had been charged for showing up to vote in a Trump hat and T-shirt with the phrase ""basket of deplorables,"" a reference to a comment Clinton made disparaging her rivals' supporters, election officials told media.

| CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa

CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump shifted quickly on Friday to take advantage of a new twist in Democrat Hillary Clinton's long-running email saga, seeking a much-needed boost in the campaign's waning days.The FBI's disclosure that it is investigating more emails as part of a probe into Clinton's use of a private email server gave fresh energy to Trump.At rallies in New Hampshire, Maine and Iowa, Trump hit hard on his message that Clinton is a corrupt leader who cannot be trusted and he pulled back a bit on his charge that the political system is rigged against him.Trump called the new development part of ""the biggest political scandal since Watergate,"" the 1970s scandal that forced the resignation of Republican President Richard Nixon.Trump abruptly changed his tune after repeatedly attacking FBI Director James Comey in the last three months for not indicting Clinton for her handling of classified information while U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.
""As you know, I've had plenty of words about the FBI lately, but I give them great credit for having the courage to right this horrible wrong. Justice will prevail,"" Trump said in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.Trump has spent weeks railing about a ""rigged system,"" accusing the Clinton campaign of coordinating attacks on him with the U.S. news media after a 2005 video surfaced of him boasting about groping women.""It might not be as rigged as I thought,"" Trump told a crowd in Manchester, New Hampshire.
By Cedar Rapids, however, he was still criticizing ""the corrupt political class"" and calling the news media dishonest.At each stop, Trump's supporters cheered loudly and chanted ""lock her up"" when the New York businessman talked about Clinton's new headache, a sign that his boosters see the importance of some good news for his campaign with 10 days left until the Nov. 8 election.
Trump noted that he is competitive in opinion polls nationally and in some states where the election is likely to be decided, but admitted he has got some distance to go.The new disclosures, he said, might help him.""We have gaps but we are really moving and I just wanted to say that because I don't know what's going to happen now,"" he said.

By Michelle Conlin, Grant Smith and Ginger Gibson
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK In the crucial last weeks of the U.S. presidential campaign, Democrat Hillary Clinton has dramatically widened her advantage over Republican rival Donald Trump in ad spending, according to campaign finance reports released on Thursday.    The newest filings showed Clinton's campaign and Super PAC outspending Trump in the first three weeks of October by a factor of two to one on everything from national TV ads to local outreach on smartphone screens.    At the same time, the two Super PACs associated with Trump's White House bid have seen their fundraising start to stall out, with one of the groups reserving no broadcast or cable ads between Oct. 20 and Election Day, according to data from ad-tracking firm SMG Delta.Clinton and Priorities USA, the Super PAC that supports her, have spent $360 million on all types of advertising since the beginning of the campaign, said the new reports, which covered spending through Oct. 19.That total blows away the $147 million spent on advertising by Trump and his two affiliated Super PACs during the same period.    What's more, for the period beginning Oct. 20 and running through the Nov. 8 election, Clinton and her Super PAC have reserved an additional $55 million in TV ads, according to SMG Delta, including $30.5 million from her campaign and $25 million from her Super PAC.A Super PAC is a fund-raising group that must operate separately from political campaigns but can raise unlimited sums.The Trump campaign has committed to spending $32.4 million during the same period, with the Trump Super PAC known as Great America PAC saying it would also contribute another $2.35 million in broadcast and cable ads.The newest batch of campaign finance filings also reveal that the celebrity businessman's recent vow that he would contribute in excess of $100 million to his campaign out of his own fortune has also fallen short. 
    Trump contributed $56 million through the end of September, chipping in an additional $31,000 since then.     Spending on television commercials does not decide an election. Trump, with his controversial statements and inflammatory tweets, has mastered the art of garnering free media coverage, which is expected to top $5 billion by Election  Day, more than double the amount Clinton is likely to earn, according to data analytics tracker mediaQuant.    But ever since Trump's campaign began to falter last summer after he criticized the family of a slain U.S. soldier, Clinton has been able to use her ad spending juggernaut to repetitively pound at criticisms of Trump, which several strategists said had exacerbated his slide in polls, where he now lags Clinton by eight percentage points.    Trump could pour more money into his ad operation in the final 11 days of the campaign. Republican presidential campaign operatives said areas where Trump could still spend included battleground states, national ad buys and digital outreach and phone banking.     But they also said it may be too late for such outlays to make a difference.    
    ""The stations would gladly take his money,"" said Fred Davis, a major Republican ad maker. ""I just don't think he will.""    During the Republican nominating contests, Trump vanquished 16 opponents in part by eschewing campaign finance mainstays such as ads and pollsters.     ""He felt he won the primary with basically no ad spending by being a larger-than-life TV personality. It worked,"" Davis said. But the general election, he added, was ""a whole new ballgame.""
    ADS DON'T MATTER 'UNTIL THEY DO'
Many of Clinton's TV ads have focused on upbeat messages featuring her work on behalf of women and children. She's also spent a large amount of her advertising budget attacking Trump, including a commercial that showed children listening to some of his most demeaning remarks about women.    Trump's ads, by contrast, paint a dark picture of America, besieged by violence and on the brink of economic destruction.    Rick Wilson, a former strategist for Republican Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign, said ""ads don't matter, until they do,"" adding that comments by Trump that critics have called racist and sexist were providing maximum ammunition for Clinton.    Trump may not be able to rely on his small cadre of big donors, either: Make America Number 1 PAC - a super PAC formed by conservative mega-donor Robert Mercer - raised nothing between Oct. 1 and 19. At the same time, Trump has also stopped doing high-dollar fundraisers.Overall, the reports released on Thursday night showed how much Trump and his lean campaign operation have been dwarfed by Clinton's big money juggernaut. In total, Trump has raised $292 million between his campaign and affiliated Super PACs, including his own contributions, whereas Clinton has hauled in more than twice that, at $718 million.

NEW YORK A plane carrying U.S. Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence skidded off the runway after landing in the rain at New York City's LaGuardia Airport on Thursday, halting flights for at least an hour, officials said.No one was injured in the incident which occurred less than two weeks before the U.S. presidential election, crucial campaign days for Pence and running mate Donald Trump.Pence pledged to hit the campaign trail again on Friday.""So thankful everyone on our plane is safe,"" the Indiana governor said on Twitter after the incident. ""Grateful for our first responders & the concern & prayers of so many.""The Boeing 737 was coming in for a landing and went off the runway at about 7:40 p.m. local time (2340 GMT). The plane was stopped by a crushable type of concrete runway that arrested the aircraft's movement, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jim Peters said.The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board said they will investigate the cause of the incident.Trump called his running mate before a rally in Geneva, Ohio.
""I just spoke to Mike Pence and he's fine,"" Trump told the crowd at the rally. ""The plane skidded off the runway and was pretty close to grave, grave danger."" Trump and Pence have slipped in the polls in recent weeks, in part due to negative public reaction to the release of a decade-old video in which Trump made lewd comments about women and said he could grab them by their genitals because he was a celebrity.Since then, numerous women have come forward to say that they were groped by Trump, claims that he has denied. 
On Thursday, Pence had been scheduled to attend a fundraiser at Trump Tower in Manhattan, but was not able to make the event after his plane slid off the runway, a campaign aide said.Pence will resume his normal schedule Friday using a different plane, the aide said.Live television footage showed Pence standing in the rain near the plane among emergency vehicles, talking to police and other officials.Trump's opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, on Twitter said she was glad Pence and the rest of the passengers and crew were safe. 
There were about 30 people onboard the plane, including Pence's wife, Karen, and daughter Charlotte, MSNBC said.The plane was coming from Fort Dodge, Iowa, where Pence had participated in a campaign event. The takeoff from Iowa was delayed for about two hours because of bad weather in New York. Pence had earlier posted on Twitter a picture of himself playing football in the bright sun on grass near his plane in Iowa, citing the delay in leaving for New York.    In 2015 a Delta Air Lines Inc jet landing during a snowstorm at LaGuardia Airport slid off the runway and struck a fence before coming to rest on a snow-covered embankment just feet from the frigid waters of Flushing Bay.

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed for the first time to rule on transgender rights in a case in which a Virginia public school district is fighting to prevent a female-born transgender high school student from using the boys' bathroom.The justices agreed to hear the Gloucester County School Board's appeal of a lower court's April 19 ruling that transgender students are protected under U.S. laws barring sex-based discrimination. The case involves a 17-year-old transgender student named Gavin Grimm, who identifies as male and sued in 2015 to win the right to use the school's boys' bathroom.The case, to be argued and decided before the end of June, will be one of the biggest of the court's term.""I never thought that my restroom use would ever turn into any kind of national debate. The only thing I ever asked for was the right to be treated like everyone else,"" Grimm said in a statement.The court's decision to take the case means Grimm will not be able to use the boys' bathroom before graduating from high school next year, said Josh Block, his lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union.""These sorts of discriminatory policies stigmatize and isolate transgender students like Gavin just because of who they are,"" Block added.'BODILY PRIVACY'
The school board's chairman, Troy Anderson, welcomed the court's decision to hear the case, saying the board's policy ""carefully balances the interests of all students and parents."" 
Conservative groups have backed the school board, saying the fight is about student privacy rights.""In light of the right to bodily privacy, federal law should not be twisted to require that a male be given access to the girls' facilities, or a female to the boys' facilities,"" said Gary McCaleb, a lawyer with the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group.At the heart of the case is the question of whether transgender people are covered by a ban on gender discrimination in education under federal law.President Barack Obama's administration concluded that they are, but there is a legal fight over whether judges are required to defer to the government's view. The justices could side-step a major ruling by focusing their decision on whether the administration followed the correct procedure when it gave public notice about that legal conclusion.The court remains one justice short following the February death of Antonin Scalia, which left it with four conservatives and four liberals. That raises the possibility of a 4-4 ruling that would leave in place the decision favoring Grimm by the Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A 4-4 ruling would set no nationwide legal precedent.
The court until now had generally steered clear of taking  potentially divisive cases while it remained shorthanded.The Supreme Court has not directly ruled on transgender rights before. But in 1994 the court did rule in favor of a male-born transgender prison inmate identifying as a woman who was held with male prisoners and said she was beaten and raped by another inmate.Whether to allow transgender people to use public bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity rather than their birth gender has become the latest flashpoint in the long U.S. battle over lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights. In a major gay rights ruling in 2015, the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.The transgender fight heated up after North Carolina passed a Republican-backed law in March that required people to use bathrooms that corresponded to their gender at birth in government buildings and public schools. The North Carolina law, being challenged in court, also blocked local measures protecting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people from discrimination. 
The Obama administration in May issued nationwide guidance telling public schools that transgender students should be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice.That guidance infuriated many conservatives and prompted a Republican-led legal effort to fight it. Twenty-three states sued to block the guidance. A U.S. district court judge on Aug. 22 issued a nationwide injunction sought by Texas and other states preventing the administration from enforcing the guidance.In the Virginia case, the Supreme Court in July voted 5-3 to temporarily block the appeals court decision from going into effect while the litigation continued, a move that prevented Grimm from using the boys' bathroom when the new school year began in September.Grimm began attending school as a boy in September 2014. With the school's permission, Grimm used the boys' bathroom for about seven weeks without incident. But after complaints from parents, the county school board adopted a new policy in December 2014 that required students to use the bathroom that corresponded with their gender at birth.Since then, Grimm has had to use a separate bathroom. As a result of hormone therapy, Grimm has facial hair and a deep voice. Grimm has also had chest reconstruction surgery but not sex reassignment surgery.
