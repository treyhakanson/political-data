By James Oliphant
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republicans cheered after the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday thwarted President Barack Obama's plan to offer millions of undocumented immigrants relief from deportation, but any sense of triumph might last only until the November presidential election. If recent history is a guide, the stalled cause of immigration reform could energize Hispanic voters in support of likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, hurting Republican Donald Trump's chances of reaching the White House. Four years ago, Obama, seeking reelection to a second term, made Republican opposition to reform a central theme of his campaign. He ended up swamping his opponent, Mitt Romney, by almost a 3 to 1 margin among Latino voters, who now make up around 12 percent of the U.S. electorate.Republican hopes for securing a larger share of that vote this election already seemed grim given Trump's vow to deport the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally and to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. Democrats were quick to assail the ruling and voice concern about the fate of the 4 million or so immigrants who were to be shielded from deportation by Obama's executive action. But it was also clear that they believe the high court has handed them a potent weapon to spur Latinos -- the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. electorate -- to vote in greater numbers.The Latino voting bloc is expected to swell to 27.3 million in 2016, up 4 million from 4 years ago. The prospect of Clinton filling the current vacancy on the top court with a liberal-leading justice who could, potentially, protect immigration-reform programs, may galvanize those voters as well. Republicans in Congress have refused to accept Obama's pick for the top court to fill the vacancy left by the death of conservative justice Antonin Scalia in February. The justices' ruling on Thursday sent the question of the legality of Obama's program back to a Texas federal court for trial, leaving open the possibility that the matter could return to the high court on appeal at a later date. The court's decision ""just adds fuel to the fire that's already raging,"" said Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist. ""Each of these events raises the intensity and the Latino turnout even more.""In the wake of the ruling, immigration activists vowed payback in November's election and staged protests on Thursday.
FIRING UP LATINO VOTERS
A recent survey by Latino Decisions, a polling firm, showed that about half of the U.S. Hispanic electorate showed greater enthusiasm to vote in 2016 as compared to 2012, with support for Obama's pro-immigrant executive orders running high. ""We should expect similar dynamics this fall, perhaps even more so given the election is likely to determine the ideological direction of the Supreme Court,"" said David Damore, an analyst for the firm.Given Trump's unpopularity with Latino voters, the question for many Democrats both in and outside the Clinton campaign has been less about attracting the bloc's support and more about making sure it votes in large enough numbers to help offset Trump's expected advantage among white voters. 
The court's decision may also help make traditionally Republican states with increasing Hispanic populations such as Arizona more competitive this election, strategists in both parties said. Reed Galen, a Republican strategist in California, said the ruling could boost Democratic hopes in Latino-heavy battleground states such as Nevada, Colorado, and Florida. ""The issue isn't getting [Latino voters] fired up,"" Galen said. ""It's getting them to show up.""Galen believes there is little his party can do now to mitigate the damage he believes Trump has done to its appeal among Hispanics. A Republican National Committee ""autopsy"" report after Romney's defeat said it was essential for the party to broaden its appeal to Hispanic voters by embracing immigration reform. ""Trump has pushed the envelope on immigration so far for Republicans, I don't know this [decision] is going to be any more damaging,"" he said. ""The barn's already been blown up.""
But Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, a conservative advocacy group, disagreed. He said Republicans in Congress could still enact reform this year, which would ward off Trump's deportation threat while building stronger ties with Latino voters. ""This is the quintessential green light for Republicans to put their money where their mouth is,"" Rodriguez said. Many Republicans were careful on Thursday to applaud the court's ruling on the grounds that it curtailed what they viewed as an abuse of executive authority by Obama, without delving into the underlying immigration issues. ""The Constitution is clear: The president is not permitted to write laws -- only Congress is,"" said Paul Ryan, the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. Ryan supports comprehensive immigration reform.Trump, however, went further, praising the ruling and saying the election now held the key to blocking further illegal immigration. ""The election, and the Supreme Court appointments that come with it will decide whether or not we have a border and, hence, a country,"" he said in a statement. He has vowed to reverse Obama's executive actions on immigration as president. (Reporting by James Oliphant; editing by Stuart Grudgings)"	['Paul', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

TURNBERRY, Scotland U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, stung by a meager fundraising haul compared with that of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, predicted on Friday his campaign would draw ""staggering"" numbers this summer.Supporters have voiced concern he will not have enough money to finance his campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Trump had $1.3 million in cash to start the month, compared with rival Democrat Hillary Clinton's $42 million war chest.""The numbers are going to be, I think, quite staggering, especially in July,"" Trump, a New York real estate developer, said at a news conference in Turnberry, Scotland, where he reopened a golf resort.
He said he had only begun fundraising in earnest a few weeks ago and that the numbers, especially for small donations, had been ""amazing.""Steve Mnuchin, Trump's top fundraiser, told CNBC on Thursday that in the past week the campaign had raised about $10 million together with the Republican Party at fundraising events. He said Trump also raised $6 million through online donations. [L1N19F0VD]
Trump said on Friday the July report ""will show you some pretty massive numbers."" Trump also has suggested he could use more of his personal wealth to help win the White House.

By Richard Cowan and Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Another attempt at gun control faltered in the U.S. Congress on Thursday despite outrage at the Orlando massacre, as a proposed ban on firearms sales to people being monitored for links to terrorism barely avoided being killed in the Senate.In a procedural vote, the Senate narrowly rejected an attempt to scrap the plan by Republican Senator Susan Collins to prevent guns getting into the hands of people on two U.S. government terrorism watch lists. But the proposal looked short of the support it would need to advance through the chamber, and Republican leaders said the Senate would switch from debating gun control to other matters until at least after the July 4 holiday.        It was the latest setback for proponents of gun restrictions who have been thwarted for years on Capitol Hill by gun rights defenders and the National Rifle Association.    Frequent efforts at gun control have failed despite anger at mass shootings like the killings at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 and in San Bernardino, California, last year. ""Eventually this problem will get addressed again one of two ways: We find a breakthrough, which I will seek, or there will be another terrorist attack which will bring us right back to this issue. I hope we can do it without another terrorist attack,"" said Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican who supported Collins.       A few hours earlier, Democratic lawmakers ended a sit-in protest in the House of Representatives over guns.Fueled by Chinese food and pizzas, dozens of them stayed on the House floor all night, at times bursting into the civil rights anthem ""We Shall Overcome"" before giving up their protest after 25 hours.        ""It's not a struggle that lasts for one day, or one week, or one month, or one year,"" said Representative John Lewis, a Democrat from Georgia and a key figure in the civil rights protests of the 1960s. ""We're going to win the struggle,"" said Lewis, who led the House sit-in.
    Dramatic protests by legislators are rare in the U.S. Capitol and the sit-in underscored how sensitive the gun control issue became after this month's Florida attack, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.Opinion polls show Americans are increasingly in favor of more restrictions on guns in a country with more than 310 million weapons, about one for every citizen.     ORLANDO ATTACK

After a gunman pledging allegiance to Islamic State fatally shot 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, some senators had seen resistance to gun restrictions softening because the issue had partly become one of national security.But Collins' measure received only 52 votes in the 100-seat Senate test vote, short of the 60 votes that would be needed for  approval in future Senate procedural votes. While her plan could be revived next month, it is unclear if she has the momentum to overcome pro-gun rights forces in Congress who argue that gun control measures in Congress have been too restrictive and trample on the constitutional right to bear arms. Four other gun control measures failed earlier this week.             Collins, a Maine lawmaker, wants to forbid gun sales to anyone on the U.S. government's ""No Fly List"" for terrorism suspects or the ""Selectee List"" of people who receive extra security screening at airports.        Despite the lack of legislation, the gun debate has stirred passions. The House Democrats' sit-in brought an outpouring of grass-roots activity. 
Jennifer Hoppe, deputy director of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said that in less than 24 hours from Wednesday, about 130,000 calls were made from supporters of gun control to members of Congress.First lady Michelle Obama backed the House Democrats' protest.""We have grieved for too many children and wept for too many families after shootings. Chicago. Tucson. Newtown. Charleston. Orlando. #Enough,"" she wrote on Twitter on Thursday.The Democrats were seeking votes on legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases, as well as measures to curb the sale of weapons to people on government watch lists            Republicans allied with the NRA gun rights group say that while they want to combat terrorism, they represent constituents who believe firmly in the constitutional right to bear arms. ""It's a tough issue. For people like myself, who come from a hunting and fishing state, it's pretty hard,"" said Senator Orrin Hatch, a conservative Utah Republican who voted against Collins.

By Roberta Rampton
| SAN FRANCISCO

SAN FRANCISCO U.S. President Barack Obama was briefed by his advisers late on Thursday on Britain's vote to leave the European Union, a result that he had argued passionately against during an April visit to London.Obama, who was scheduled to deliver remarks to global entrepreneurs at a conference at Stanford University at 10:45 a.m. PDT (1:45 p.m. ET/1745 GMT), was dining out at an upscale restaurant with a small group of top venture capitalists and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs as the results for the ""leave"" campaign began to roll in.The group at San Francisco's Twenty-Five Lusk included John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, and LinkedIn's Reid Hoffman.Obama dined for more than two hours, departing shortly after British networks called the referendum for the ""leave"" campaign, and markets plunged. A White House official said Obama had been briefed on the returns and would ""continue to be updated by his team as the situation warrants.""
""We expect the president will have an opportunity to speak to Prime Minister Cameron over the course of the next day, and we will release further comment as soon as appropriate,"" the official said in a brief statement to reporters.Obama traveled to London in April at the request of Cameron, whom he calls a friend, exhorting Britons to stay in the EU, an unusual intervention that was denounced as meddling by those in the ""leave"" campaign.
Obama also warned that leaving the EU would put Britain at the ""back of the queue"" for a trade deal with the United States.Obama's term in the White House ends on Jan. 20, 2017. His former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic candidate in the Nov. 8 election, had also said she hoped the UK would stay in the EU.
The presumptive Republican nominee - real estate magnate Donald Trump - had taken the opposite stance, saying he thought the UK should leave. Trump, in Scotland on Friday to reopen a golf resort, told reporters that Britons ""took back control of their country"" by voting to leave the European Union.

By Amy Tennery

A blackout of television cameras in the U.S. House Representatives during the Democrats' gun control sit-in may have spurred public interest in the protest as it forced the demonstrators to use social media to broadcast their message.Democrats leapt on Facebook Live and Twitter's Periscope after the cameras, controlled by the House, went dark Wednesday when presiding House officer and Republican Representative Ted Poe declared the chamber not in order during the protest.As Democrats took to alternative forms of video broadcasting, their message gained tremendous momentum from social media. On Twitter, the hashtags #NoBillNoBreak and #HoldTheFloor have been tweeted at least 1.4 million times.Of the roughly 20 members of Congress who remained at the sit-in overnight, 19 of them used Facebook Live for a total combined viewership of 3 million.""It really connected with people out there,"" Congressman Scott Peters told Reuters. ""This whole phenomenon with [live video] struck a nerve.""Peters used the application Periscope, which is connected to the social media platform Twitter, to send out video.
""Without that, think about it, it would have been a caucus meeting where we talk to ourselves,"" he added. In remarks Wednesday outside the Capitol, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi praised how her party harnessed social media.""Without you and without the technology of Periscope [the sit-in] would just be a debate in the Halls of Congress unrecorded because they turned off the microphones,"" Pelosi said. ""But we raised our voices. They turned off the cameras and we went to Periscope.""
Congressman Mark Takano, who began posting live videos from the chamber to his Facebook page Wednesday afternoon and continued to throughout the night, said the social media video helped him connect with constituents.""Once I got started with the live streaming I didn't feel like I could let down the people who were following me,"" said Takano. ""It was a way to push out a message.""Even C-SPAN, which typically broadcasts footage recorded by the House cameras, picked up live video from four different members of Congress roughly two hours after the House cameras shut down, according to communications director Howard Mortman. It marked the first time the channel broadcast a live social media feed from the House floor.
""Something interesting is happening with Facebook Live that's bringing more openness to the political process,"" said Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, in a post to his social media profile Thursday.""It's a way to share anything you want with the world using just your phone.""

By Andy Sullivan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democrats in Congress ended a 25-hour sit-in on the floor of the House of Representatives where they have been countless times before: short of the votes needed to tighten U.S. gun laws.But many see their latest defeat as a prelude to victory in the Nov. 8 elections.Spurred by the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, Democrats are showing a new willingness to make gun laws a top issue in Washington and on the campaign trail, defying powerful lobbying groups like the National Rifle Association that have helped make the United States the most gun-friendly country in the developed world.The effort is not likely to change federal firearms laws this year, as Republicans who control Congress have shown little interest in proposals that they say weaken Americans' constitutional right to bear arms.But Democrats and their allies say that defeat now on Capitol Hill could help them win control of the White House and both chambers of Congress in the Nov. 8 elections. That is a shift from previous elections when Democrats have downplayed the issue on the campaign trail.""The tide has turned, and Republicans ignore this issue at their own peril,"" said Robert Weiner, a former Democratic congressional aide. Hillary Clinton, the Democrats' presumptive presidential nominee, talks frequently in her campaign about banning military-style assault rifles and expanding background checks -- a marked contrast to President Barack Obama, who avoided talk of guns during his 2008 and 2012 elections.In Congress, Democrats have resorted to confrontational tactics to force gun votes since June 12, when a gunman killed 49 people at a Florida nightclub. Senator Chris Murphy's 15-hour speech in the Senate last week forced five votes this week on measures that would make it harder for terrorism suspects to buy guns, though none have advanced.In the House, Democrats occupied the chamber for 25 hours in an unsuccessful attempt to force votes on terrorism suspects and expanding background checks for gun buyers.Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway said Democrats' willingness to talk about guns reflects the party becoming more liberal, not a change in public sentiment. 
Most voters view the shooting in Orlando as an act of terrorism inspired by Islamic State, she said.""The shooter called 911 to pledge allegiance to ISIS, he did not call 911 and pledge allegiance to Smith & Wesson,"" she said, referring to an acronym for Islamic State and the firearms manufacturer.A STICKING POINT
Still, Democrats' willingness to take a stand on gun control has shifted the debate, said Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf.
""There's a potentially a good electoral outcome for Democrats out of this. They will probably pick up seats,"" he said.After landslide defeats in 2010 and 2014, most Democrats who remain in office tend to represent safely liberal congressional districts where gun control is popular. But those up for election in competitive states have spoken up as well.U.S. Representative Patrick Murphy, who hopes to unseat Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio in gun-friendly Florida, said during the House sit-in that gun rights groups like the NRA are ""largely responsible"" for the country's 32,000 annual gun deaths. ""This passion you're seeing is what's needed to get people to wake up,"" he said on the House floor.The NRA did not respond to a request for comment.
Democrats have public opinion on their side: a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll conducted this week found that 48 percent of those surveyed support strong gun regulations, while 23 percent support minimal rules. Support runs higher for specific proposals, like imposing background checks on all gun buyers. (bit.ly/28U7CA7)But intensity has been a sticking point for gun control advocates. The NRA has been able to mobilize supporters who are willing to vote for or against a candidate solely because of their position on guns, while gun-control supporters typically consider other issues as well, such as abortion and the environment.""Anytime the Democrats start a gun movement, it costs them votes,"" said Dave ""Mudcat"" Saunders, who has worked for centrist Democratic candidates. ""I can't imagine it's changing.""Shootings in Newtown, Connecticut; San Bernardino, California; Charleston, South Carolina; and, most recently, Orlando have changed that dynamic, others say. ""Mass shootings are highly visible, and force people to pay attention and realize that we have a problem that isn't going to be solved by more guns,"" said Tharon Johnson, a Democratic strategist in Atlanta who worked on Obama's 2012 campaign.The gun-control lobbying group Everytown for Gun Safety says its members generated 245,000 telephone calls to Congress, and brought hundreds of its members to Congress to press for action during the debate.""I've been in the fight for a number of years and I've never seen anything like this,"" said Colin Goddard, an advocate with the group who was wounded during the 2007 Virginia Tech mass shooting.

By Roberta Rampton and Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The White House on Thursday threatened to veto the $1.1 billion approved by the U.S. House of Representatives to fight the Zika virus, blasting the measure for short-changing the administration's $1.9 billion funding request.The Republican-controlled House approved the funding deal early Thursday morning after reaching a deal with both House and Senate Republicans.White House spokesman Eric Schultz said the bill ""falls far short"" of the amount of money recommended by health officials to address the spread of the Zika virus.""This is a bill that would steal money from other critically important public health priorities,"" Schultz told reporters at a briefing. ""We urge Republicans to stop turning this into a political football, and to actually get to work to come up with proposals that will serve the American people.""The administration also criticized the bill for limiting contraception access for women seeking to prevent Zika, which can be spread through unprotected sex. 
The Senate is expected to vote on funding to combat the Zika virus next week, but the bill faces an uncertain fate in the chamber, where the Democratic minority has more power to stop legislation. Democratic leader Harry Reid has declared his opposition.Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan urged the Senate to move on the bill.""It is a responsible plan that assures the administration will continue to have the needed resources to protect the public,"" Ryan said. Republicans said the deal included funding for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. 
If the Senate approved the bill, a White House veto would likely mean that lawmakers would not take up the issue until the House and Senate return from their July 4 holiday recess - well into the U.S. summer season. The House has already adjourned for holiday and the Senate is expected to start its recess next Friday.      Democrats have been urging Republicans for months to agree to more Zika funding, and the Obama administration has already reprogrammed nearly $600 million that had been set aside to fight Ebola.House Democrats said they could not go along with the deal because of $750 million in budget cuts elsewhere that the Republicans want to use to pay for the Zika spending.
Senate Democrats also voiced displeasure, clouding the outlook for it passing.""A narrowly partisan proposal that cuts off women's access to birth control, shortchanges veterans and rescinds Obamacare funds to cover the cost is not a serious response to the threat from the Zika virus,"" Reid said. According to House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, $543 million of the $1.1 billion would come from unspent funds set aside for implementing Obamacare in U.S. territories, while $107 million would come from unused funds to fight another virus, Ebola. Another $100 million would come from unused administrative funds at the Department of Health and Human Services, he said.
