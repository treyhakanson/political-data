WASHINGTON President Barack Obama said after meeting with the top four congressional leaders on Monday he was encouraged that lawmakers would be able to pass short term spending legislation to keep the government open during the 2017 fiscal year. Democrat Obama said he was hopeful about reaching agreements with the Republican-majority Congress on funding to fight the Zika virus and for disaster relief after flooding in Louisiana.The president met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan, both Republicans, and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi on issues that have been a struggle as his second term winds down.""My hope is that by the time Congress adjourns before the election that we will have an agreement in place to fund the government and that our Zika funding will be taken care of,"" Obama told reporters in the Oval Office. Obama will leave office on Jan. 20. 
Obama said he hoped Congress can make ""modest progress"" before the Nov. 8 elections and he was ""even more hopeful we can get some things done,"" after them.Congress must pass a temporary spending bill by Sept. 30 or much of the federal government will shut down. Shortly before the meeting with Obama, McConnell said congressional leaders were making progress on legislation on temporary spending and Zika. McConnell said he expected to advance the legislation in the Senate this week.
Congressional leaders are considering attaching as much as $1.1 billion in Zika spending to the temporary spending bill. In February, Obama had asked Congress to approve $1.9 billion in emergency funds to fight Zika with diagnostic tools and vaccines, but disagreements over side issues related to abortion have led to divisions about full funding.
Ryan spoke at the meeting about his desire to come to a speedy resolution on short term spending legislation that includes funding for Zika, an aide to the speaker said. Ryan also made clear his objections to doing a massive spending bill later in the year, the aide said.

By Jonathan Landay
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Former CIA Director James Woolsey, a vocal advocate of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq who promoted allegations that Saddam Hussein harbored illegal weapons, will serve as a senior national security adviser to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, the campaign announced on Monday.Woolsey's hiring contrasted with Trump's repeated assertions that he was a stalwart opponent of the invasion, although he initially supported it.In the announcement, Woolsey said he supports Trump's plan to expand the U.S. military, which calls for ending Pentagon budget caps and spending billions of dollars for additional troops, ships and aircraft.""Mr. Trump's commitment to reversing the harmful defense budget cuts signed into law by the current administration, while acknowledging the need for debt reduction, is an essential step toward reinstating the United States' primacy in the conventional and digital battlespace,"" Woolsey said.
Woolsey, who served for two years as CIA chief under then-President Bill Clinton, also criticized the presence of classified information in emails stored on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's private server.In an appearance on CNN, however, he called Trump's plan to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States ""a bad decision."" He also has warned about the threats posed by climate change, something Trump has called a hoax that benefits China.Woolsey was an outspoken proponent of the Iraq invasion, suggesting that Saddam was hiding nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs from U.N. inspectors. He also promoted the erroneous allegation that the Iraqi dictator backed al Qaida's Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
Shortly after former President George W. Bush took office in 2001, Woolsey visited Britain on a Defense Department trip in a fruitless hunt for evidence that Saddam masterminded the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center in New York. He made a second visit to Britain for the same purpose shortly after Sept. 11, and again came up empty.At the time of his second trip, Woolsey was a member of the Defense Policy Board, a panel of outside advisers to the Defense Department that advocated Saddam's overthrow even in the absence of any evidence of his complicity in 9/11.
The following year, he arranged for the Defense Intelligence Agency to debrief an Iraqi defector who claimed that Iraq had mobile biological-warfare laboratories disguised as yogurt and milk trucks. The man was later determined to be a fabricator.In 2000, Woolsey briefly served as a corporate officer of a foundation that managed U.S. funding for the Iraqi National Congress, the exile group that produced a series of defectors who peddled false information to bolster the allegations that Saddam was hiding illicit weapons programs. No such weapons or facilities have ever been found. (Reporting by Jonathan Landay; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"	['Trump']	[]

By David Shepardson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Four Republican members of Congress on Monday urged U.S. auto safety regulators to convene an industry-wide effort to prevent possible attacks on computer systems in vehicles.The lawmakers addressed their concerns in a letter to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. While there have been no reported cases of vehicle hacking, researchers have shown they could take remote control of vehicle functions such as car horns, brakes and power steering.The letter cited work published in August by Wired magazine by two researchers who were able to force a Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV 2014 Jeep SUV to perform in an ""erratic and unsafe manner"" after accessing its on-board diagnostics (OBD) port. Automakers have been required to install the port in all vehicles since 1994 to test for emissions compliance.The letter from Representative Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and three others said the port ""as it currently exists creates a growing risk to the safety and security of passengers.""
Fiat Chrysler said in August the demonstration published by Wired required ""a computer to be physically connected into the vehicle's"" port. The company emphasized that owners should ""not connect any unknown or untrusted devices to the OBD port.""NHTSA didn't immediately comment on the letter. The safety agency has said it plans to release cybersecurity guidelines to the auto industry in the coming weeks.
The U.S. government is taking the issue seriously.On Friday, the U.S. Justice Department said it has formed a threat analysis team to study potential national security challenges posed by self-driving cars, medical devices and other internet-connected tools.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation and NHTSA issued a bulletin in March warning that motor vehicles were ""increasingly vulnerable"" to hacking. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Richard Chang and James Dalgleish)"	[]	[]

4	4	http://reuters.com/article/us-health-zika-qanda-factbox-idUSKCN11I2IB	Factbox: Why the Zika virus is causing alarm	"

Global health officials are racing to better understand the Zika virus behind a major outbreak that began in Brazil last year and has spread to almost 60 countries. The following are some questions and answers about the virus and current outbreak:How do people become infected?Zika is transmitted to people through the bite of infected female mosquitoes, primarily the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the same type that spreads dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are found in all countries in the Americas except Canada and continental Chile, and the virus will likely reach all countries and territories of the region where Aedes mosquitoes are found. The virus can also be transmitted through sex, from either a male or female partner who has been infected, and a few cases of apparent infection via blood transfusion have been reported.How do you treat Zika?There is no treatment or vaccine for Zika infection. Companies and scientists are racing to develop a safe and effective vaccine for Zika, but a preventative shot is not expected to be ready for widespread use for at least two or three years.How dangerous is it?The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that infection with the Zika virus in pregnant women is a cause of the birth defect microcephaly, a condition defined by unusually small heads that can result in developmental problems, and other severe brain abnormalities in babies. The CDC said that since the causal relationship had been established, several important questions must still be answered with studies that could take years.The World Health Organization in an updated assessment said the ""most likely explanation"" is that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital brain abnormalities including microcephaly. In addition, the agency said infection is a trigger of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis.The update from the WHO came after considering months of research. Its previous statement, based on a rapid assessment of evidence, said there was strong scientific consensus that Zika virus caused GBS, microcephaly and other neurological disorders.
Brazil recently reported 1,835 confirmed cases of microcephaly believed to be linked to Zika infections in pregnant women. It is investigating more than 3,200 suspected cases of microcephaly.Current research indicates the greatest microcephaly risk is associated with infection during the first trimester of pregnancy, but health officials have warned an impact could be seen in later weeks. Recent studies have shown evidence of Zika in amniotic fluid, placenta and fetal brain tissue.What are the symptoms of Zika infection?    People infected with Zika may have a mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain and fatigue that can last for two to seven days. But as many as 80 percent of people infected never develop symptoms.
How can Zika be contained?Efforts to control the spread of the virus focus on eliminating mosquito breeding sites and taking precautions against mosquito bites such as using insect repellent and mosquito nets. U.S. and international health officials have advised pregnant women to avoid travel to Latin American and Caribbean countries, sections of Miami, Florida in the United States and Singapore where they may be exposed to Zika. They are also advising that men and women who have traveled to Zika outbreak areas use condoms or abstain from sex for six months to prevent sexual transmission of the virus.How widespread is the outbreak?Active Zika outbreaks have been reported in at least 58 countries or territories, most of them in the Americas, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Brazil has been the country most affected. (1.usa.gov/1ovAJyh)Africa (1): Cape Verde

What is the history of the Zika virus?The Zika virus is found in tropical locales with large mosquito populations. Outbreaks of Zika have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Southern Asia and the Western Pacific. The virus was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys and was first identified in people in 1952 in Uganda and Tanzania, according to the WHO. What other complications are associated with Zika?Zika has also been associated with other neurological disorders, including serious brain and spinal cord infections. The long-term health consequences of Zika infection are unclear. Other uncertainties surround the incubation period of the virus and how Zika interacts with other viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes, such as dengue.

By Amanda Becker

 (This version of the Sep. 11 story corrects the condition to hypothyroidism in paragraph 28)By Amanda BeckerNEW YORK Hillary Clinton is suffering from pneumonia, the Democratic presidential candidate's personal doctor said on Sunday after she fell ill at a Sept. 11 memorial, an episode that renewed focus on her health less than two months before the election.Clinton canceled a trip she was scheduled to take to  California on Monday for fundraising and other campaign events, an aide said, declining to provide further details about her schedule for the week. Clinton, 68, was diagnosed on Friday but her condition only came to light several hours after a video on social media appeared to show her swaying and her knees buckling before being helped into a motorcade as she left the memorial early Sunday.  Clinton had a medical examination when she got back to her home in Chappaqua, New York, according to a campaign aide. Her doctor, Lisa Bardack, said in a statement that she has been experiencing a cough related to allergies and that an examination on Friday showed it was pneumonia.""She was put on antibiotics and advised to rest and modify her schedule. While at this morning's event, she became overheated and dehydrated. I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely,"" Bardack said.Clinton's pneumonia diagnosis comes at a crucial time in the White House race against Republican rival Donald Trump, who refrained from commenting on her health on Sunday.The first of three presidential debates is on Sept. 26 and the election is on Nov. 8.Democratic National Committee head Donna Brazile said she was encouraged that Clinton ""already is feeling better"" and  looked ""forward to seeing her back out on the campaign trail and continuing on the path to victory.""Several Clinton allies said the incident underscored the candidate's resilience.""After being diagnosed with pneumonia, Hillary Clinton ran a two-hour national security meeting, gave a press conference, and spent an hour and a half in the heat at a September 11 event,"" said Peter Daou, who worked for Clinton in the past and now has a communications firm.""It was an impressive feat of physical strength that undermined weeks of health conspiracies.""
'LESS SPECULATION'
Clinton abruptly departed the high-profile, televised event at Ground Zero and was taken to her daughter Chelsea's home in Manhattan. She emerged around two hours later on a warm and muggy morning, wearing sunglasses and telling reporters that she was ""feeling great.""The video that showed her swaying and buckling with aides holding her up came from an unverified Twitter account under the name Zdenek Gazda, who did not respond to a request for comment.     The Clinton campaign did not respond to repeated requests for comment about the authenticity of the video.Political strategists said the campaign should confront the health issue head-on to tamp down any concerns, particularly as Republican rival Donald Trump and some of his high-profile supporters have repeatedly argued that she lacked the ""stamina"" to battle adversaries abroad.Bud Jackson, a Virginia-based Democratic strategist, said the statement from the doctor was a good start. He said the incident should encourage more transparency from the campaign about her health. ""I think they did the right thing. They had her examined and put out a statement. It means less speculation,"" he said.As the solemn ceremony began at the site of the World Trade Center that was attacked by two hijacked airliners 15 years ago, there was patchy sunlight, with temperatures at about 80 degrees Fahrenheit (26.6 Celsius). But the high humidity early into the ceremony caused it to feel much hotter in the crowd at times. 
Clinton wore a high-collared shirt and a dark pant suit and donned sunglasses for the morning event. Clinton's pneumonia diagnosis follows a wave of conservative conspiracy theories that circulated in recent weeks suggesting that Clinton's coughing was a sign of deeper problems.Clinton's speech at a campaign rally earlier this month in Cleveland was interrupted by a coughing spell. During the speech, she quipped, ""Every time I think about Trump I get allergic."" She then resumed her speech.Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert and senior associate at the UPMC Center for Health Security in Pittsburgh who is not treating Clinton, said coughing is a cardinal symptom of pneumonia. Recovery from pneumonia, the 8th leading cause of death in the United States, can be variable, he said, adding it takes a week for most patients to get better. Adults above the age of 65 are at heightened risk.
PRESIDENTIAL PRECEDENTS
Past presidential candidates have released much more detailed information about their health than either Trump, 70, or Clinton.For example, John McCain, the failed 2008 Republican presidential nominee, allowed reporters to see 1,173 pages of medical records after concerns were raised about a cancer scare.Clinton has been in the news before for serious health issues.In December 2012, she suffered a concussion and shortly afterward developed a blood clot.In a letter released by her doctor in July 2015, Clinton was described as being in ""excellent health"" and ""fit to serve"" in the White House. It noted that her current medical conditions include hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies.The diagnosis and illness on Sunday come after some tough days for Clinton, as national polls showed her lead over Trump diminishing. A Reuters/Ipsos poll of likely voters showed an 8-point lead for Clinton had vanished by the last week of August. On Saturday, Clinton came under fire from Republicans and on social media for saying Friday night that ""half"" of Trump's supporters belonged in a ""basket of deplorables."" She later said she regretted using the word ""half."" [nL1N1BM0BH]     Trump has also been under pressure to release detailed information on his health and medical history.Instead, in December, Trump's doctor wrote in a short letter that was made public that his blood pressure and laboratory results ""were astonishingly excellent"" and that he would be ""the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.""

By Tom Polansek
| CHICAGO

CHICAGO A U.S. congresswoman urged the Labor Department on Monday to investigate Chipotle Mexican Grill for possible wage theft, another potential hurdle for the burrito chain as it seeks to rebound from food-safety problems last year.U.S. Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut, said the department should probe allegations from about 10,000 current and former Chipotle employees who have joined a federal lawsuit that alleges the company did not properly pay them for hours worked.Such actions, if true, would contradict federal law, DeLauro said in a letter to the department, ""depriving workers of the wages and earnings to which they are legally entitled.""Chipotle said her call for an investigation was ""misdirected.""""We have maintained from the outset that this case is without merit and will vigorously defend our employment practices,"" company spokesman Chris Arnold said.
The Labor Department had no immediate comment.Chipotle has been working to revive sales growth after outbreaks of E. coli, norovirus and salmonella linked to its restaurants sickened more than 500 people last year and drove away customers.
Last week, activist investor William Ackman disclosed that his hedge fund had purchased a 9.9 percent stake in the company, saying it was undervalued.The case over unpaid wages began two years ago when Leah Turner, who worked as a manager at a Chipotle restaurant in Colorado, alleged in a lawsuit that the company routinely required hourly paid employees to work ""off the clock,"" according to court records. The company used timekeeping devices that automatically punched employees off the clock, even if they were still working, the lawsuit said.
Since then, about 10,000 others from across the country have joined the lawsuit seeking to recover unpaid wages, said Andrew Quisenberry, an attorney representing the workers for law firm Bachus & Schanker. The large number of plaintiffs is ""significant to us, showing that it's widespread across Chipotle,"" Quisenberry said.The case is Tuner et al vs Chipotle Mexican Grill, U.S. District Court, District of Colorado, No. 14-cv-02612.
