By Julia Edwards
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. immigration officials are planning a month-long series of raids in May and June to deport hundreds of Central American mothers and children found to have entered the country illegally, according to sources and an internal document seen by Reuters.The operation would likely be the largest deportation sweep targeting immigrant families by the administration of President Barack Obama this year after a similar drive over two days in January that focused on Georgia, Texas, and North Carolina.Those raids, which resulted in the detention of 121 people, mostly women and children, sparked an outcry from immigration advocates and criticism from some Democrats, including the party's presidential election frontrunner Hillary Clinton.Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has now told field offices nationwide to launch a 30-day ""surge"" of arrests focused on mothers and children who have already been told to leave the United States, the document seen by Reuters said. The operation would also cover minors who have entered the country without a guardian and since turned 18 years of age, the document said. Two sources confirmed the details of the plan.  The exact dates of the latest series of raids were not known and the details of the operation could change. The operation in January marked a departure for ICE, part of the Department of Homeland Security, from one-off deportations to high-profile raids meant to deter migrants from coming to the United States. An ICE spokeswoman said the agency does not ""confirm or deny the existence of specific ongoing or future law enforcement actions."" The spokeswoman said immigrants who arrived illegally after Jan. 1, 2014 are priorities for removal.Federal resources were strained in 2014 under a wave of illegal migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, especially women and children fleeing violence in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.
The planned new raids are in response to a renewed surge of illegal entries by Central American women traveling with their children. From October 2015 through March 2016, the U.S. Border Patrol apprehended more than 32,000 family ""units"", defined as mothers and children traveling together, for crossing illegally into the United States. Over the same period in 2014-2015, there were about 14,000 such apprehensions; in 2013-2014, about 19,800.(Graphic on immigration patterns of Central American migrants: tmsnrt.rs/1qglGZG)Many of those apprehended for unlawful entry are put into deportation proceedings in court but do not show up for their scheduled appearance before a judge or ignore court orders to leave the country.
The surge in illegal border crossings has put Obama in a tough spot in a presidential election year in which he wants to see a fellow Democrat elected as his successor.  Obama has said criminal immigrants and those who have recently entered the country are priorities for deportation. He is regularly hammered by Republicans over the presence of more than 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country. But Hispanic-Americans tend to vote for Democrats, who are more sympathetic to the plight of the undocumented.Clinton raised concerns about the January raids at the time, saying they had ""sown fear and division in immigrant communities.""
The presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has pledged to build a wall along the Mexican border to prevent illegal immigration.Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told a U.S. Senate panel in March that the January raids had helped to deter Central Americans from migrating illegally. Border Patrol reported fewer illegal entries between January and March 2016 compared to October and December 2015, but there were more apprehended than over the same time period in early 2015.A separate document seen by Reuters said Johnson was concerned about the most recent uptick in border crossings. Immigration advocates say they have asked Johnson to abandon plans for future raids.""Raids are not the answer,"" said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, a legal aide and advocacy group for migrants.""This is a humanitarian challenge,"" she said.

| HAVANA

HAVANA Cuba and the United States will meet next week for a third round of talks on improving relations, Havana said on Thursday, adding that the two former Cold War foes were not yet negotiating their multibillion-dollar claims against one another.A bilateral commission will meet next Monday in the Cuban capital to evaluate the progress made in putting their decades-old conflict behind them, and to identify new areas of cooperation, said Gustavo Machin, the deputy director for U.S. affairs in the Cuban foreign ministry.""We will set the agenda for the rest for the year,"" Machin told a news conference.""We are not yet negotiating the topic of claims even if there is a recognition on both sides that these exist.""Cuba and the U.S. reestablished diplomatic relations a year ago and have signed agreements on issues of common concern such as the environment, postal services and direct flights.
Many differences remain however. Machin reiterated Cuba's demands for the return of the Guantanamo naval base and lifting of the U.S. trade embargo.Cuba complains that some of the policy changes the U.S. has carried out, such as relaxing currency restrictions against the island, have had little real impact given the persistent fear among U.S. institutions of risking government sanctions.The White House said in March it would allow U.S. banks to process dollar transactions for Cuba as long as neither buyer nor seller were U.S. entities.
""Until now, no bank transactions have been carried out in U.S. currency,"" Machin said. ""There is still a great fear.""Cuba has said it will only lift a 10 percent tax on cash dollars once it is clear U.S. banks are processing dollar transactions for the Communist-ruled island.
The issue of reparations is another sticky point. Late last year, Cuba and the U.S. outlined their respective claims, with the former demanding at least $121 billion in reparations for the U.S. trade embargo and other acts it describes as aggressions against the Caribbean country.The Americans meanwhile are seeking upwards of $10 billion in compensation for nationalized properties.The third bilateral commission will be led by Josefina Vidal, the Cuban Foreign Ministry's chief of U.S. affairs, and Kristie Kenney, counselor for the U.S. State Department.

By Roberta Rampton
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama is set to toast the five leaders of Nordic nations at a lavish state dinner at the White House on Friday, an unusual summit aimed in part at sending a message to a nation not on the guest list: Russia.Obama will laud the humanitarian and environmental accomplishments of Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Iceland, but also wants to talk about how to deal with their increasingly aggressive neighbor Russia ahead of a NATO summit in July.""We share the concern of countries in the region, particularly those who have a border with Russia, about the increasing presence of Russian military assets in the area,"" said Charles Kupchan, Obama's senior director for European affairs.""We will be discussing ways to enhance the security of the region, writ large, and also what we can do through dialogue and diplomacy to urge Russia to be more transparent and to be more restrained and careful in its military exercises,"" Kupchan told reporters.Obama last met Nordic leaders in Stockholm in 2013 on his way to a G20 summit in St. Petersburg after canceling a planned bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin because of tensions over Syria and surveillance issues.Since then, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region, prompting Nordic nations to step up their military cooperation and the United States to boost military spending to help NATO do more to try to deter Russia.During a recent visit to Europe, Obama sought to reassure allies about the U.S. commitment to the continent, but pushed nations to increase their defense spending and stay united amid the strain of dealing with an influx of migrants fleeing Middle East conflicts.The leaders will discuss a long-term approach for dealing with refugees, Kupchan said, as well as new contributions to the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq. He declined comment on specific commitments from the meeting.
'SHADOWY SPACES'
Typically, the White House rolls out the red carpet for one leader at a time. Friday will be a bit trickier, juggling five guests of honor and their entourages.The state dinner itself will be in a large tent with a transparent ceiling evoking the northern lights and ""shadowy spaces in the arctic night,"" the White House told reporters.
Guests will sit at long, rustic wooden tables bedecked with columns of ice, fiddlehead ferns, and fragrant hand-rolled beeswax candles, and dine on braised Nebraska beef short ribs and salt-cured Atlantic ahi tuna served in a large ice cube. The summit is expected to be heavy on ""feel-good"" messages about the outsized role Nordic nations play in international diplomacy, said Julie Smith, a former Obama administration official now with the Center for a New American Security.""In many ways, the actual visit is the deliverable,"" Smith said, noting it was unlikely major new initiatives would emerge.""We're at the end of the president's tenure so there are limits on what new things he can drive forward,"" Smith said.
In Washington, preparations for the leaders' arrival have been overshadowed by a visit by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to meet with congressional leaders as the race intensifies to replace Obama in the White House in the Nov. 8 election.Trump has said NATO is obsolete and European nations should look after their own defense, which has sparked concern among Nordic nations, said Heather Conley, a former State Department official in the George W. Bush administration.""They hear with great clarity the statements of Donald Trump and they don't know exactly how this is going to work in November,"" said Conley, now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg plans to stress the importance of American participation in NATO for Nordic nations, she said in an interview this week with the Norwegian daily Aftenposten.""With an unpredictable Russian presence in the northern areas, it's important that the Americans have a focus on the Arctic regions,"" Solberg said.

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Donald Trump's foreign policy proposals would make the world a less stable place, former Secretary of State James Baker told a U.S. Senate hearing on Thursday as the Republican presidential candidate met elsewhere with party congressional leaders.Under questioning from Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a former Trump rival in the presidential race, Baker said the world ""would be far less stable"" with a weaker NATO or if more countries had nuclear weapons as Trump has proposed.""We've a got a lot of problems today, but we'd have a hell of a lot more if that were the case,"" Baker told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, adding that U.S. commitments around the world ""promote U.S. security.""Trump met with Baker on Thursday at Trump's request, said a Baker spokesman, who declined further comment.  The hearing, on ""America's Role in the World,"" was called by the committee's Republican chairman, Senator Bob Corker. Corker praised a foreign policy speech Trump gave in Washington last month. Some U.S. allies worried after Trump's remarks that his invocation of an ""America first"" agenda is a threat to retreat from the world.
Without naming Trump, Rubio referred to the businessman-turned-candidate's suggestions that the United States should rethink the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and that Japan and South Korea should consider getting nuclear weapons to defend themselves.""Some have suggested 'why don't you just let Japan and South Korea get their own nuclear weapons and let them defend themselves?'"" Rubio asked.""The more countries that acquire nuclear weapons, the more instability there is going to be in the world, in my opinion,"" Baker said.
Tom Donilon, Democratic President Barack Obama's former national security adviser, called Rubio's question an ""important thought experiment,"" as he backed Baker's comments about the importance of NATO.""It's not just a thought experiment, it's actually been proposed,"" Rubio said.
As the hearing took place, Trump was on Capitol Hill meeting with Republican congressional leaders on how to heal divisions within the party, including those between establishment figures like Baker and the insurgent candidate.Baker, a Republican who was secretary of state under President George Bush and Treasury secretary under President Ronald Reagan, testified alongside Donilon.Former Presidents Bush and George W. Bush do not plan to endorse Trump, or any candidate, in this year's White House race. (Editing by Marguerita Choy and David Gregorio)"

By Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Three competing plans for battling a potential Zika virus outbreak in the United States were presented on the floor of the U.S. Senate on Thursday, as lawmakers tried to break an impasse pitting President Barack Obama against congressional Republicans.The first test votes on the measures, which would provide at least $1.1 billion in new funds to deal with the spreading virus, were expected on Tuesday.In February, Obama urged Congress to quickly approve $1.9 billion in emergency funds to deal with prevention and treatment of Zika virus, which the World Health Organization warns is spreading rapidly in the Americas.The disease, transmitted by mosquitoes, has been linked to the birth defect microcephaly and other severe brain abnormalities. It also is suspected of causing a rare neurological disorder, Guillain-Barre syndrome, that can result in paralysis.White House spokesman Josh Earnest welcomed ""any sort of forward momentum in Congress"" while continuing to push for the full $1.9 billion.""It could not be clearer that Congress needs to take action to help our states and our local officials fight the Zika virus. That is critical for health and safety of the American people,"" Earnest said.
Florida's senators, Bill Nelson, a Democrat, and Marco Rubio, a Republican, called for the full $1.9 billion, saying $1.1 billion was inadequate.They noted that the Florida Department of Health has reported a total of 112 Zika virus cases, the most of any U.S. state, as the mosquito season goes into high gear with hotter temperatures.  One proposal now before the Senate would provide Obama with his full $1.9 billion request for emergency funds. A second one would scale back Obama's request to $1.1 billion.
These two options would not require spending cuts elsewhere to cover the Zika costs, Senate aides said.A third one would take money from Obamacare to pay for $1.1 billion in Zika response funds.Even if the Senate approves one of these proposals, its fate is uncertain in the House of Representatives, where Republicans are deeply divided over new Zika funding, according to aides.
Two senior Republican aides said the party's House leadership has been unable to formulate a plan on Zika legislation and is preoccupied with internal party strife over Donald Trump becoming the presumptive presidential nominee, as well as a deadlock over Puerto Rico debt legislation and a budget blueprint that has been stuck in the House.While plans to unveil a new Puerto Rico bill on Wednesday were canceled, a third senior House Republican aide noted there is progress on that legislation and that ""discussions"" on a budget ""are moving forward as well.""   Senate backers of each amendment will try to attach their competing proposals to an unrelated spending bill the Senate started debating on Thursday.

By Dustin Volz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Kentucky Senator Rand Paul plans to become the first Republican co-sponsor of legislation to block a pending judicial rule change that would let U.S. judges issue search warrants for remote access to computers located in any jurisdiction, his office told Reuters on Thursday.The bill is expected to be introduced next week. Backing from Paul, a former Republican candidate for president with libertarian leanings, lends bipartisan support to an effort to undo a little-noticed modification to a text governing procedural rules for the U.S. court system that civil liberties groups warn would drastically expand the FBI's hacking authority.So far, that cause has largely been championed solely by Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and digital privacy advocate. He has vowed to work to stop the rule change on grounds it would allow the government to use one warrant to access and search thousands or millions of computers at once, potentially implicating those suspected of no wrongdoing. Magistrate judges can normally only order searches within the jurisdiction of their court, which is typically limited to a few counties.
But last month the Supreme Court, in a private vote, approved the amendments to Rule 41 of the federal rules of criminal procedure, which would permit judges to issue warrants in cases when a suspect uses anonymizing technology to conceal the location of his or her computer or for an investigation into a network of hacked or infected computers, such as a botnot.Congress has until December 1 to pass legislation that would reject, amend or postpone the changes to Rule 41. If lawmakers do nothing, which is customary in these circumstances, the changes automatically will take effect.The U.S. Justice Department, which is pushing for the rule change, has described it as a procedural tweak needed to modernize the criminal code, and has said it would not permit searches that are not already legal.
Alphabet Inc's Google has warned the change poses a ""monumental"" threat to the Constitution's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. Last year Paul and Wyden worked together to force a temporary expiration of the USA Patriot Act, which led to passage of surveillance reforms that pared backed the National Security Agency's controversial bulk collection of U.S. call records.
Other lawmakers are also examining Rule 41. Republican Senator Mike Lee is looking at ways to address concerns, a spokesman said, and a small group of lawmakers in the House are weighing introduction of companion legislation, sources said. (Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by David Gregorio)"

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A U.S. judge on Thursday handed a victory to congressional Republicans who challenged President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, ruling that his administration overstepped its constitutional powers relating to government spending.U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer, based in Washington, ruled that the administration cannot spend billions of dollars in federal funds to provide subsidies under the law known as Obamacare to private insurers without the approval of Congress.At issue in the case, brought by the Republican-led House of Representatives, are reimbursements to insurance companies to compensate them for reductions that the law requires them to make to customers' out-of-pocket medical payments.The ruling will not have an immediate effect on the law because the judge put the decision on hold pending an expected appeal by the administration. But it adds to uncertainty over the future of Obama's signature domestic policy achievement ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential and congressional elections, including whether enough health insurers will continue to participate in the program.Insurers have sustained losses from their Obamacare business, saying they have not attracted enough healthy customers to offset the costs of sicker members. Two of the largest players, UnitedHealth Group and Humana Inc, had already said they would not offer plans in many markets next year.""If you're going to lose more money, why participate?"" asked Steve Halper, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets.Shares in hospital operators such as Community Health Systems Inc fell sharply, while insurer stocks including Aetna Inc, which plans to remain in at least 15 Obamacare markets next year, also declined.In court papers, the administration had warned that a court victory for the House Republicans would lead to a spike in insurance premiums for Americans and force the government to pay more in tax credits to insurance policy-holders.As part of an appeal, the administration is likely to press its argument that the House lacks legal standing to sue. 
""This suit represents the first time in our nation's history that Congress has been permitted to sue the executive branch over a disagreement about how to interpret a statute,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters.""It's unfortunate that Republicans have resorted to a taxpayer-funded lawsuit to re-fight a political fight that they keep losing,"" Earnest added. ""They've been losing this fight for six years, and they'll lose it again.""REPEATED CHALLENGES

Conservatives have mounted a series of legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act since it was passed by Congress in 2010 over unified Republican opposition. Collyer was appointed to the bench by Republican former President George W. Bush.The law has helped bring insurance coverage to millions of Americans who previously had none, subsidizing the cost of insurance through tax credits. In addition, the federal government helped defray consumers' out-of-pocket costs.The House Republicans argued that the administration's action violated the U.S. Constitution because it is the legislative branch, not the executive branch, that authorizes government spending.""BIG win for the Constitution,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan wrote on Twitter.Jonathan Turley, the lawyer who spearheaded the lawsuit, in a blog post called the ruling ""a resounding victory not just for Congress but for our constitutional system as a whole.""
The appeals court in Washington may be more receptive to the administration's arguments, in part because seven of its 11 active judges are Democratic-appointees, including four picked by Obama.The case focuses on a cost-sharing provision of Obamacare that requires insurers to reduce deductibles and co-pays. Insurers are supposed to be reimbursed for these costs by the federal government. Cost-sharing is determined by the income of the policyholder and is a mechanism for reducing healthcare costs for lower-income households. The Obama administration has interpreted the provision as a type of federal spending that does not need to be explicitly authorized by Congress. The House Republicans who filed the challenge disagreed.Collyer ruled that the cost-sharing provisions cannot be funded through the same permanent appropriation that covers tax credits made available under the law.The judge rejected the administration's contention that the appropriation should be viewed as permanent because the alternative interpretation would lead to ""absurd economic, fiscal and healthcare policy results.""The U.S. Supreme Court in June 2015, in a ruling authored by Bush-appointed Chief Justice John Roberts, rejected a conservative challenge that could have gutted Obamacare, upholding nationwide tax subsidies crucial to the law. Roberts also wrote a major 2012 ruling preserving Obamacare.

CHICAGO A bill to send $700 million to cash-starved social services providers breezed through the Illinois Legislature on Thursday, as the state once again turned to stopgap funding measures in lieu of a budget.The measure passed the House 111-0 and the Senate 56-0. There was no immediate comment from Governor Bruce Rauner's office on whether he will sign it into law. A memo from his budget office expressed concerns that language in the bill could actually prevent funding for some programs.Democratic State Representative Greg Harris said the money would be taken from state funds outside of Illinois' general revenue fund to cover 46 percent of what the state has failed to pay service providers due to the ongoing impasse over the fiscal 2016 budget.""This is a $700 million piece of legislation that would help the neediest at the time they need help the most,"" he said.Despite the stalemate between the Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature, about 90 percent of Illinois government is being funded through continuing appropriations, the enactment of a K-12 school bill, and court-ordered spending.
But some parts of the government were left out in the cold. Earlier this month, dozens of unpaid social service providers sued Illinois, seeking more than $100 million. Andrea Durbin, chairman of the Pay Now Illinois coalition that filed the lawsuit, said that if enacted, the bill would not end the litigation.""It could provide a downpayment of the money we are owed, but it's not a comprehensive solution for the Pay Now Illinois plaintiffs,"" she said.
In April, the legislature passed and Rauner signed a $600 million stopgap funding bill for state universities, community colleges, and student tuition grants that covered only 34 percent of the $1.7 billion that had been earmarked for higher education spending in the fiscal year that began on July 1.Illinois is the only U.S. state without a complete fiscal 2016 budget. Rauner earlier on Thursday acknowledged that some lawmakers are working on a budget framework. That framework involves higher taxes, spending cuts, and borrowing, according to local media reports. 
""I'm cheering for bipartisan General Assembly members to come up with some solutions,"" the governor told reporters. (Reporting by Karen Pierog; Editing by Matthew Lewis)"

By Tom Miles
| GENEVA

GENEVA Hollywood actor Michael Douglas, a U.N. ""messenger for peace"", wants President Barack Obama to issue a strong message against nuclear weapons when he visits Hiroshima in Japan later this month.Douglas told reporters at the United Nations in Geneva, where nuclear negotiations have been stuck for 20 years, that the nuclear danger was greater than during the Cold War,  largely due to a ""huge escalation"" in U.S.-Russia tensions and increasing recklessness in their close-quarter contacts.""There's this kind of crazy tension between U.S. and Russia. We have our issues but I don't quite see that all of this posturing is helping anybody,"" he said.""The number of weapons that are on trigger alert is frightening. So the time for somebody to possibly make a mistake and correct it is very very short.""
Douglas said he ""found religion"" in the anti-nuclear cause after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979, within days of the opening of his film The China Syndrome, which dealt with an emergency at a nuclear plant.  Standing beside Joseph Cirincione, president of Ploughshares Fund, a global security organization, Douglas recalled Obama's 2009 speech in Prague, where the president promised concrete steps to wards a nuclear-free world.""I think we could say he's been a disappointment because there's not been follow through, and I do hope now for his legacy as he begins to leave office, that he's going to have something strong to say at Hiroshima.""
Cirincione said Obama had made good early progress on nuclear non-proliferation, but had made only modest cuts in arsenals and was leaving $1 trillion in new nuclear contracts in the pipeline for his successor.""Every single weapon in the nuclear arsenal is now due for replacement or an upgrade. It's a looming disaster,"" he said.
Douglas, 71, said he was also a friend of Donald Trump, but he was not confident the United States would make any advances in nuclear disarmament if Trump won the presidency. ""I guess one of his strengths, or weaknesses depending how you look at it, is his unpredictability,"" he said. (Reporting by Tom Miles; Editing by Dominic Evans)"
