| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The top members of the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee have urged their counterparts in the House of Representatives to move forward on Senate legislation to boost aviation security and authorize the programs of the Federal Aviation Administration.In a May 24 letter released on Wednesday, the senate panel's Republican chairman, John Thune of South Dakota, and its top Democrat, Bill Nelson of Florida, cautioned House lawmakers that Congress has only six weeks left to approve legislation before a temporary FAA funding patch expires in mid-July.The letter, addressed to House Transportation Chairman Bill Schuster of Pennsylvania and that panel's top Democrat, Peter DeFazio of Oregon, urged movement on a Senate bill that passed with overwhelming bipartisan support last month.""We believe that this legislation represents a model for House action, which is essential to avoiding another round of funding extensions that will be disruptive to the aviation industry and only delay much-needed reforms,"" Thune and Nelson said. 
House lawmakers have not taken up the Senate bill but have focused instead on their own multi-year measure that stalled due to disagreement over a controversial plan to privatize the U.S. air traffic control system.Aides to Shuster were not available for comment. 
But DeFazio said he agreed with the senators about the need to move forward. ""We could pass comprehensive legislation with broad bipartisan support today if the Republicans drop their divisive scheme to privatize air traffic control,"" the Oregon Democrat said in a statement issued by his office.  
Thune and Nelson described the Senate bill as ""the only viable opportunity this year"" to deliver comprehensive legislation to President Barack Obama for his signature. They added that the House privatization measure would face hurdles in the Senate even if the House reached agreement.""We understand the commitment to this (privatization) proposal, but the Senate is far from reaching a consensus on this issue,"" the senators said.

WASHINGTON Top U.S. State Department officials were aware of Hillary Clinton's use of private email as secretary of state but did not understand the full extent to which she employed it, a department spokesman said on Wednesday.Spokesman Mark Toner said the State Department has already complied with many recommendations in an inspector general's report on Clinton's email use and acknowledged failings during her 2009-2013 tenure.
""We, like many federal agencies, were not doing enough to meet the requirements of records management and preservation,"" Toner said at a news briefing.

He also said the report, which was distributed to lawmakers, showed no successful breach of the private server she used.

WASHINGTON A Romanian computer hacker who revealed the existence of a private email server used by Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state pleaded guilty to hacking-related offenses on Wednesday, the U.S. Justice Department said.Marcel Lazar, who used the alias ""Guccifer,"" entered his guilty plea before Judge James Cacheris in U.S. District Court, Alexandria, Virginia, the department said in a statement. Sentencing was set for Sept. 1.
In recent media interviews, Lazar claimed he had easily hacked into Clinton's controversial private email server. But the Justice Department statement did not confirm this claim, and a law enforcement official said investigators did not find evidence to support the claim.

By Brendan O'Brien

Protesters threw rocks and bottles at police officers who responded with pepper spray outside a rally for presidential candidate Donald Trump in Albuquerque, New Mexico, police said.    Hundreds of protesters tried to storm the convention center in New Mexico's biggest city, knocking down barricades and throwing objects at a door and then hurling rocks and bottles at mounted police in riot gear, the Albuquerque Police Department said on Twitter on Tuesday and video posted online showed. Several police officers were injured, the police tweeted. Protesters chanted anti-Trump slogans, held anti-Trump signs and waved Mexican flags before the demonstration descended into chaos with some protesters standing on top of police cars.  Television footage showed officers responding by using pepper spray and smoke bombs to disperse the crowd.
Police said they made arrests both outside and inside the rally, where protesters continually interrupted Trump's speech. No one at the police department was immediately available for comment.
Protests have become common outside rallies for Trump, the party's presumptive nominee, who has polarized opinion with his rhetoric against illegal immigration. He abandoned a rally in Chicago in March after clashes between his supporters and protesters.He has accused Mexico of sending drug dealers and rapists across the U.S. border and has promised to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it.According to CNN, his supporters chanted ""build that wall"" during his rally on Tuesday in Albuquerque where a little less than half of the population is Hispanic or Latino.    
""Watching thugs (and) punks in Albuquerque - en route to California. They don't even know what they are protesting,"" Trump aide Dan Scavino said on Twitter. Trump heads on Wednesday to a rally in Anaheim, California, which has a growing Latino minority.  (Editing by Louise Ireland)"	['Trump']	[]

By Matt Spetalnick
| HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam

HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam U.S. President Barack Obama sought on Wednesday to ease growing Asian worries about the raucous election campaign to succeed him which has been dominated by the incendiary rhetoric of  mogul Donald Trump, now the Republican Party's nominee.""I think other people sometimes look at our election system and say 'what a mess',"" Obama told a townhall meeting with young leaders in Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.""But usually we end up doing okay because the American people are good people ... Sometimes our politics doesn't express all the goodness of the people,"" he said, without referring specifically to any of the presidential candidates.Obama made the comments just before ending a three-day trip to Vietnam, whose high point was an announcement that Washington's ban on sales of lethal weapons to the country - a vestige of the Vietnam War - would be completely lifted.Obama repeatedly insisted that lifting the embargo was not a response to Beijing's assertiveness in the South China Sea.  Critics accused Washington of throwing away a powerful lever it had to press communist-ruled Vietnam for improvements in human rights.White House officials say the arms move was a natural step to take with a country that, once an enemy, is now a key part of Obama's strategic 'rebalance' towards Asia and an important trade partner as its economy grows apace.Obama also announced the Peace Corps would begin operating in Vietnam for the first time.""EVENTUALLY VOTERS MAKE GOOD DECISIONS""
Across Asia, policymakers have been startled by Trump's ""isolationist"" foreign policy pronouncements, which have challenged much of the status quo in Washington's relations with the region.
Many fear Trump will feed insecurity in nations worried about China's growing power, embolden nationalists and authoritarians, and unravel Obama's 'pivot' to the Asia-Pacific.At the townhall in Ho Chi Minh City, a young woman who had been an exchange student in Montana asked Obama what he thought of the prospects that Trump or Democratic contenders Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders following him to the White House.""Usually, eventually the voters make good decisions and democracy works,"" replied Obama, whose criticism of Trump has sharpened since he all but clinched the Republican nomination. ""Things are going to be ok. I promise.""Thousands of people lined the streets of Ho Chi Minh City for a second day to cheer enthusiastically and wave mini-flags of Vietnam and the United States as Obama drove by on his way to the airport for a flight to Japan. At his freewheeling townhall, where he was greeted with a standing ovation, Obama noted that two-thirds of the country's population were born after 1975, when the war ended with North Vietnamese tanks rolling into Saigon to bring U.S.-backed South Vietnam under communist rule.
Obama prodded Vietnam's leaders on political freedoms during his visit after critics of the government were prevented from meeting him. When a woman rapper at the townhall asked him about supporting arts and culture, he segued into an appeal for people to be allowed to express themselves.TRADE, CLIMATE CHANGE
However, his unusually long one-country visit was warm and mostly about strengthening diplomatic and economic relations.Annual U.S.-Vietnam trade has swelled from $450 million when ties were normalized in 1995 to $45 billion last year. Washington is a big buyer of Vietnam's televisions, smartphones, clothing and seafood.
Obama repeatedly touted the benefits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact, of which export-led Vietnam will be one of the biggest beneficiaries, if it survives opponents in Washington concerned about competition and a loss of U.S. jobs.He also talked about the challenges of climate change when asked about the drying-up of the Mekong River in the rice-bowl delta of southern Vietnam, urging Southeast Asian countries to work together.The Mekong River, which sustains 60 million livelihoods as it flows through Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, is under threat from at least 39 hydro-electric dams being built or under development upstream of Vietnam, most of them in China.Low river levels have allowed seawater to penetrate inland, ruining vast swathes of cropland in the fertile delta.Obama did not name any of the upstream countries but said the United States would provide smaller member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) with technical assistance and evaluations of what needs to be done.""Hopefully ... that information can be used to negotiate on an international level to try to prevent some projects that might have very bad effects,"" he said. ""One of the things that we've seen in ASEAN is that when small countries band together as a unit, then the power magnifies.""  Japan is the final stop on Obama's swing through Asia, where he is attending a summit of the Group of Seven industrialized nations starting Thursday.

6	6	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-energy-idUSKCN0YG186	Trump advisers push him to target OPEC, regulations in big energy speech	"


By Valerie Volcovici
| WILLISTON, North Dakota

WILLISTON, North Dakota Two energy advisers to Donald Trump want him to call out members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries for driving down world oil prices when he delivers a major energy policy speech this week. The advisers, who said they had been asked by Trump's 2016 presidential campaign to contribute ideas for the speech, told Reuters they had also suggested he mention cuts to regulations and a streamlining of the federal tax code to make U.S. energy companies more competitive.The advisers, U.S. Congressman Kevin Cramer of North Dakota and another who asked not to be identified, said they had urged Trump to criticize the OPEC cartel for contributing to a crash in world oil prices by producing full throttle, a factor that has helped push many U.S. oil companies into bankruptcy.""We have to look at the global playing field and see which of our partners - OPEC, Iran, Russia - are playing fair in the global marketplace,"" Cramer said about the advice he had been giving Trump.Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has not shied from targeting OPEC's top producer, Saudi Arabia, in the past. He has said the United States should consider halting oil purchases from the kingdom if it does not provide troops to fight Islamic State militants who control swaths of Syria and Iraq.Trump's speech on Thursday at the Williston Basin Petroleum Conference in North Dakota, the heart of U.S. drilling country that has been hard hit by the oil price slump, may reveal for the first time how he will approach the energy sector if elected.A spokeswoman for Trump's campaign declined requests for comment and it was unclear whether Trump would use any the ideas provided by the advisers.     
Trump has so far been mostly mute on details of his energy policy. He has dismissed climate change as a hoax, promised to renegotiate the U.N. global climate accord, and vowed a revival in the U.S. coal industry, which has been hobbled by low prices and rules that limit pollution emissions.  Environmental advocates and Hillary Clinton, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, have criticized his stance for underplaying the economic and social risks of climate change.
FOREIGN OWNERSHIP    
Cramer, who cosponsored a bipartisan bill to investigate OPEC's influence in the oil market, said Trump should examine Saudi and Venezuelan ownership stakes in U.S. refineries that import foreign oil instead of using domestic supply, if he is elected president. ""One-third of (U.S.) refining capacity is owned by OPEC countries. How does this fit into (Trump's) America first policy?"" Cramer said.Cramer's suggestions, and those of the second adviser Reuters interviewed, have been sent to Trump senior policy advisers including John Mashburn, who is expected to help draft Trump's speech, according to sources familiar with the campaign.
Mashburn could not be reached for comment.The organizer of Thursday's conference, North Dakota Petroleum Council President Ron Ness, said 7,700 people were expected to attend, many probably hoping for assurances from Trump that he will help the oil industry be more competitive. ""We can manage the cyclical nature of the market but what we are struggling with is the daily onslaught of punitive regulations,"" he said.   Cramer has suggested to Trump that he ease regulations like the Clean Power Plan, which is aimed at curbing emissions scientists believe contribute to global warming. He also wants Trump to consider the scope of waterways protected under the Clean Water Act.

PARIS Former finalist Simona Halep survived a first-set wobble to reach the third round of the French Open for only the second time in her career with a 7-6(5) 6-2 win over Kazakhstan's Zarina Diyas on Wednesday. The Romanian sixth seed surrendered her serve twice in the opening four games to trail 4-1 but delved into her wealth of experience to finally subdue her 90th-ranked opponent 7-5 in the tie break.More exchanges of breaks followed in the second set before Halep finally found her groove to take a 5-2 lead and set up three match points on Diyas' serve.The first one went begging but Halep's gritty baseline play paid off in the next point as Diyas bowed out after flicking a forehand long to end a 10-shot rally.
""The first set was very tough and I was very nervous as I seemed to be fighting for every point,"" Halep said in a court side interview.
The good news for Halep is that the only previous time she reached the last 32, she made it all the way to the 2014 Roland Garros final.Halep and her bizarre black and white zebra print dress will be back on court on Friday when she takes on Japan's Naomi Osaka for a place in the fourth round.

LONDON A giant mural of Donald Trump locked in a kiss with former London mayor Boris Johnson in the style of a legendary Soviet-era image has been unveiled by a group campaigning for Britain to stay in the European Union.Painted on the side of a building in Bristol, southwest England - home of the celebrated graffiti artist Banksy - the image reprises a 1979 photograph of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and East German President Erich Honecker kissing, which was later turned into a mural on the Berlin Wall. It was commissioned by pro-EU campaign group ""We are Europe"" as what they call a warning of things to come if Britons vote to leave the 28-member bloc on June 23, as advocated by both Johnson and Trump, the presumptive Republican candidate in November's U.S. presidential election.Johnson is the ""Out"" campaign's best-known leader and Trump has said Britain would be ""better off without"" the EU, which he has blamed for Europe's migration crisis.
The 15-foot (4.5 meter) mural is accompanied by the slogan ""Not #IN for this?"" and a plea for people, especially the young, to register to vote by a June 7 deadline.""People need to look at this image and think - is this the future I want,"" said Harriet Kingaby, a spokesperson from We Are Europe.
Galvanizing the youth vote is a key issue for the ""In"" camp. Surveys show young people are far more likely to be in favor of remaining in the EU but also much less likely to bother to vote.
A survey of 2,000 students this month found that 63 percent did not know the exact date of the referendum, while 54 percent were not aware it was being held in June. (Reporting by Stephen Addison; Editing by Gareth Jones)"	['Trump']	[]

By Susanna Twidale
| COLOGNE

COLOGNE Donald Trump would be ""highly unlikely"" to be able to renegotiate the global accord on climate change if elected U.S. president, the U.N.'s climate chief said on Wednesday, as doing so would require the agreement of 195 countries. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told Reuters earlier this month he was ""not a big fan"" of the climate accord and would seek to renegotiate elements of the deal.""As we all know, Donald Trump relishes making very dramatic statements on many issues, so it is not surprising, but it is highly unlikely that that would be possible,"" Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, told journalists at the Carbon Expo event in Cologne.The accord, struck in Paris last December, saw countries agree to cut greenhouse gas emissions from 2020 with the aim of limiting the rise in the global average temperature to less than 2 degrees Celsius.
""An agreement that has been adopted by 195 countries would require 195 countries to agree to any new negotiation,"" she said.She added the current U.S. administration was a strong supporter of the deal because it benefits the country.
Many of the accord's backers say it is in U.S. interests to limit greenhouse gas emissions, partly because cuts in the use of fossil fuels would also mean less air pollution, a big cause of disease. Trump has said in the past he believes global warming is a concept that was invented by China to hurt the competitiveness of U.S. business.
The Paris Agreement will formally enter into force when 55 nations representing at least 55 percent of world greenhouse gas emissions have ratified it. China and the United States, representing 38 percent, say they will join this year.Figueres said if this happens the agreement could come into force as early as 2017. It would then be even harder for the U.S. to pull out, as rules state any nation wanting to leave has to wait four years from the date of the agreement's entry into force - the length of a U.S. presidential term.
