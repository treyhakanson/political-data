By Amanda Becker
| LOS ANGELES

LOS ANGELES Democrat Hillary Clinton said on a late-night television show on Monday that sometimes she feels she is in an ""alternative universe"" in the U.S. presidential race against Republican Donald Trump.""I do feel sometimes like this campaign has entered into an alternative universe,"" Clinton said on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live. ""I have to step into the alternative reality, answer questions about am I alive, how much longer will I be alive.""Clinton was for the first time responding to allegations made by Trump and some of his backers that she is suffering health problems that could be problematic in the White House should she win the Nov. 8 election.Both Clinton and Trump have released notes from doctors declaring them physically fit for the presidency.Kimmel asked Clinton to open a jar of pickles as a test of her strength. She did so successfully.
""This has become one of their themes. Take my pulse while I'm talking to you - make sure I'm alive,"" Clinton said to Kimmel of the health rumors.Clinton said that sometimes Trump's remarks about her - such as a recent charge that President Barack Obama and Clinton co-founded the Islamic State, which he later said was sarcasm - go beyond personal attacks and become harmful to U.S. national security.""There's enough evidence now that when Trump talks the way he talks it actually helps the terrorists,"" Clinton said. ""I think it's crazy, but I think it's also harmful.""
Clinton said she had begun preparing for the three presidential debates scheduled in September and October.""I want to take it seriously,"" Clinton said. ""But you've got to be prepared for, like wacky stuff that comes at you and I am drawing on my experience in elementary school.""
Clinton brushed off the possible release of an additional 14,900 emails that the FBI found when investigating her use of a private email server as secretary of state.""My emails are so boring,"" Clinton said. ""What's a few more?""The U.S. State Department has already reviewed some 30,068 emails from her 2009-2013 tenure and released most of them, amounting to some 55,000 pages.

By Steve Holland
| AKRON, Ohio

AKRON, Ohio Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump urged the Justice Department on Monday to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate if donors to the Clinton Foundation got special treatment from the State Department when it was run by his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.Trump made the appeal at a rally before thousands of cheering supporters in Akron, Ohio, as he tries to rebound from a slide in national opinion polls with little more than two months to go until the Nov. 8 election.Trump accused former President Bill Clinton and his wife of turning the Clinton Foundation charity into a ""pay-for-play"" scheme in which wealthy donors, foreign and domestic, got favors from the State Department during Hillary Clinton's 2009-2013 tenure as the country's top diplomat.Trump faulted both the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation for not indicting Clinton over her use of a private email server as secretary of state. FBI Director James Comey cited her careless handling of classified emails but opted not to prosecutor her.""The Justice Department is required to appoint a special prosecutor because it has proved to be, sadly, a political arm of the White House,"" Trump said. ""Nobody has ever seen anything like it before.""Trump's appeal came the same day a conservative watchdog group, Judicial Watch, released 725 pages of State Department documents, including some it said were examples of preferential treatment provided to donors at the request of former Clinton Foundation executive Douglas Band.Trump's call for an independent investigation followed an announcement by the Clinton Foundation that it would no longer accept foreign donations should Clinton be elected president.
The Clinton campaign fired back at Trump, saying the foundation had already laid out ""the unprecedented steps the charity will take if Hillary Clinton becomes president.""Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said in a statement that Trump ""needs to come clean with voters about his complex network"" of businesses that are in debt to big banks, including the state-owned Bank of China, after a New York Times report on the subject.""Donald Trump should stop hiding behind fake excuses and release his tax returns and immediately disclose the full extent of his business interests,"" Podesta said.
SEEKING TO EXPAND BASE
While keeping up the attack on Clinton, Trump in his speech also outlined some agenda items, as Republicans have been urging him to do for months. The more disciplined Trump followed a campaign shake-up last week that brought in veteran pollster Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager.But in a sign that organizational challenges remain, Trump canceled a rally planned for later this week in Las Vegas and postponed an immigration speech in Denver.
Earlier on Monday, Trump insisted he was not ""flip-flopping"" on immigration, despite a comment by Conway on Sunday that his plan to deport 11 million illegal immigrants was still under review.In his Akron remarks, Trump, struggling to broaden his support beyond the white working-class voters who have been his base of support, again urged blacks and Hispanics to give him a chance, saying: ""What the hell do you have to lose?"" repeating a line he delivered on Friday that was criticized by Clinton as ""ignorant.""Trump said Democratic politicians had not been able to stem crime and poverty in inner cities despite pledges to do every election year.""I say it and I'm going to keep saying it and some people say: 'Wow that makes sense' and some people say: 'That's not very nice,'"" Trump said. ""And I say it with such a deep-felt feeling, what do you have to lose? We'll bring jobs back. We'll bring spirit back. We'll get rid of the crime.""

By Ginger Gibson and Arshad Mohammed
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A judge ordered the U.S. State Department on Monday to review for possible release 14,900 of Hillary Clinton's emails and attachments that the FBI found when investigating her use of a private email server as secretary of state.The judge also scheduled a Sept. 23 hearing on when to release the emails, a deadline that raises the possibility some will become public before the Nov. 8 presidential election between Democrat Clinton and her Republican rival, Donald Trump.Questions about her email practices as secretary of state have dogged Clinton's White House run and triggered a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe that found she was ""extremely careless"" with sensitive information by using a private server but recommended against bringing charges.State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters it was still reviewing the 14,900 documents and it was unclear how many were personal or work-related. He also said it was unclear how many may duplicate those already released but that there were ""likely to be quite a few"" not previously disclosed.The department has already culled through some 30,068 of  Clinton emails from her 2009-2013 tenure as secretary of state and released most of them, amounting to some 55,000 pages. More than 2,000 emails were found to contain classified information.The disclosure of further emails could provide more fodder for opponents who have seized on the issue to argue that Clinton is untrustworthy.Clinton, who leads Trump in opinion polls, has said she did not compromise classified information and used a private server for convenience. She later apologized, saying: ""I take responsibility.""The order by U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg, who is overseeing a group of lawsuits seeking to make Clinton's emails public, came the day a conservative watchdog group, Judicial Watch, made public a batch of Clinton's emails obtained through a lawsuit. 
Judicial Watch said the emails showed donors to the Clinton family's charitable foundation seeking access to her during the period she was secretary of state.Toner said the State Department believed there was ""no impropriety"" in foundation officials seeking to meet Clinton, saying any secretary of state or aides get such requests from a wide range of people.The 14,900 documents referred to by Boasberg are believed to include emails not included among those Clinton previously turned over to the State Department after her use of a private email server and private email account became public.""This number reflects both non-record (meaning personal) and record materials (meaning work related),"" said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.Some of the emails were found on the servers of people with whom Clinton or her staff was communicating.
'TRYING TO PIN IT ON ME'
Former Secretary of State Colin Powell dismissed reports over the weekend that Clinton told federal investigators that it was at his suggestion that she used a personal email account, according to a media report.Powell, who served as the nation's top diplomat from 2001 to 2005 under Republican President George W. Bush, told People magazine that while he did send Clinton a memo about his own email practices, Clinton had already chosen to use personal email rather than a government account while she had the job.
""Her people have been trying to pin it on me. ... The truth is, she was using (the private email server) for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did,"" Powell told People on Saturday.  The New York Times reported last week that Clinton told federal investigators that Powell had suggested she use personal email for unclassified email when the two spoke over dinner. The conversation occurred ""in the early months"" of Clinton's tenure at the State Department, the Times said, citing a forthcoming book by journalist Joe Conason that first reported the dinner exchange.Representatives for Powell, in a separate statement to NBC News, said he had no recollection of the conversation with Clinton.""He did write former Secretary Clinton an email memo describing his use of his personal AOL email account for unclassified messages and how it vastly improved communications within the State Department,"" his office told NBC on Friday.The email exchange occurred in 2009, according to the Times.Powell and aides to his successor as secretary of state in the Bush administration, Condoleezza Rice, received some classified information via personal email accounts, Reuters has reported. Clinton's additional use of a personal computer server at her home, however, broke State Department rules, an internal watchdog found.

WASHINGTON Two senior lawmakers on the U.S. Senate's Judiciary Committee  on Monday pushed for information regarding sharp price increases for EpiPens, drug-filled injectable devices used by people to counter potentially deadly allergic reactions. Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch on Monday to ask how Mylan determined the price of EpiPens and what changes had been made to the product to account for the higher price.The top Democrat on the committee's antitrust subcommittee, Senator Amy Klobuchar, urged the Federal Trade Commission on Monday to investigate the prices, citing news reports showing that the price of a pack of two EpiPens had gone from $100 in 2008 to $500 this year. Mylan acquired the product in 2007.""Although the antitrust laws do not prohibit price gouging, regardless of how unseemly it may be, they do prohibit the use of unreasonable restraints of trade to facilitate or protect a price increase,"" wrote Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who said her daughter relies on an EpiPen.""The FTC should investigate whether Mylan Pharmaceuticals engaged in activity, such as using incentives or exclusionary contracts with insurers, distributors, or pharmacies, to deny an alternative product access to the market.""
An EpiPen injects a pre-measured dose of epinephrine (adrenaline) that people use if they are having a dangerous allergic reaction.The FTC did not say whether an investigation was under way. ""The commission takes seriously its obligation to take action where pharmaceutical companies have violated the antitrust laws,"" a spokesman said.
Mylan did not immediately comment on the letters but noted in an email that nearly 80 percent of people with commercial insurance who use a savings card can get the medicine for free.""With changes in the healthcare insurance landscape, an increasing number of people and families are enrolled in high deductible health plans, and deductible amounts continue to rise. This shift has presented new challenges for consumers, and they are bearing more of the cost,"" Mylan also said.
The FTC opened a probe into Turing Pharmaceuticals for possible antitrust violations in connection with the company's decision to sharply raise the price of a life-saving drug. Turing had raised the price of Daraprim to $750 a tablet from $13.50. (Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editig by Steve Orlofsky)"	[]	['healthcare']

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican lawmakers called on U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Monday to overhaul proposed regulations intended to crack down on American companies that try to reduce their U.S. taxes by rebasing abroad in a process known as inversion.In separate letters, top Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee warned on Monday that Treasury is moving too quickly to adopt regulations to prevent overseas mergers known as tax inversions, in which U.S. firms relocate their headquarters in countries with lower corporate tax rates.""If the proposed regulations are not completely overhauled, they would damage our economy, increase the barriers to investment for American businesses and innovators, and interfere with the growth of ... good-paying jobs,"" said a letter to Lew from Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady and other Republicans on the panel. ""We cannot allow this to happen,"" they wrote.  
The regulations were proposed in April and Treasury has indicated that it intends to move swiftly to finalize the rules. Industry leaders fear the rules could be in place permanently as early as September.One new inversion rule, which has already been imposed on a temporary basis, was challenged this month in federal court by business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Brady and other Republicans including Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch trained their sights on proposals that industry officials say would swamp business with new red tape and cripple internal cash management operations at companies that are not involved in tax inversions.
""The only prudent way to move forward -- given the complexity of the subject matter, given the many significant substantive concerns that have been pointed out, and given the procedural irregularities -- is to issue the regulations in re-proposed form,"" Hatch said in his letter to Lew. The proposed debt-equity rule is aimed at stopping a practice known as earnings stripping, which occurs when a newly inverted company eludes U.S. taxes by moving profits overseas as tax-deductible interest payments on loans to its foreign parent.
Treasury has proposed requiring debt interest payments to be converted into stock dividends, which are not tax deductible.Critics say the regulations, as proposed, could play havoc with the internal finances of a range of unsuspecting businesses, from multinational corporations to limited partnerships.

By Alana Wise and Julia Edwards
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A senior aide to U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump signaled a possible shift in his hardline immigration policies on Sunday, saying his plans to deport 11 million people who are in the country illegally were under review.Trump has put his vow to toughen the country's immigration policies at the center of his campaign. He has promised to carry out mass deportations and build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, proposals that critics have assailed as inhumane and too costly and unrealistic to achieve. Trailing Democrat Hillary Clinton in opinion polls for the Nov. 8 election and struggling to broaden his support beyond the white working-class voters who have been his base of support, the New York businessman has reached out in recent days to black and Hispanic voters. On Sunday, his new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told CNN that Trump was committed to a ""fair and humane"" approach to those living in the country illegally.  ""What he supports is to make sure we enforce the law, we are respectful of those Americans who are looking for well-paying jobs and that we are fair and humane to those who live among us in this country,"" Conway said on ""State of the Union.""Pressed on whether Trump's plans would include a ""deportation force"" that the candidate previously pledged to set up, she replied: ""To be determined.""Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, a close ally of Trump, told CBS's ""Face the Nation"" that Trump was still working through his plans for deportations should he win the White House.  
""He's wrestling with how to do that. People that are here unlawfully, came into the country against our laws, are subject to being removed. That's just plain fact,"" the Alabama lawmaker said. ""He's thinking that through.""Trump has also been rebuked by opponents for his proposal to impose a temporary ""total and complete shutdown"" of Muslims seeking to enter the country, later rolled back to focus on countries with ""a proven history of terrorism."" Clinton has accused Trump of sowing divisiveness and said she would propose a path to citizenship for some migrants living in the United States illegally. The former secretary of state has said that militant groups like Islamic State have begun using Trump's proposed Muslim ban as a recruitment tool. 
CAMPAIGN SHAKE-UP
Conway's comments came after Trump announced last week a major reshuffling of his campaign. Trump promoted Conway, who had been a senior adviser, to the role of campaign manager and hired Stephen Bannon, head of the Breitbart News website, as campaign chief executive.The Trump campaign said on Friday that campaign chairman Paul Manafort was resigning.
The campaign's new leadership combines Bannon, a combative conservative, with Conway, a data-driven analyst who has been trying to broaden Trump's appeal to women and independent voters. Trump's support has slumped in national polls in recent weeks and surveys in pivotal states such as Pennsylvania and New Hampshire have shown a widening lead for Clinton.A Reuters/Ipsos survey released on Friday showed Clinton leading Trump nationally by 8 percentage points, 42 percent to 34 percent.Trump vowed at a campaign rally in Fredericksburg, Virginia, on Saturday to return the Republican Party to the values of President Abraham Lincoln, who issued the Emancipation Proclamation and championed the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution during the U.S. Civil War that led to the abolition of slavery in 1865.Earlier on Saturday, Trump met with a group of Hispanic leaders as part of a new National Hispanic Advisory Council to the campaign.

By Steve Holland and Emily Flitter

Donald Trump's U.S. presidential campaign sealed a major staff reshuffle with the resignation on Friday of its campaign chairman, and the Republican nominee tried to end weeks of upheaval to focus on beating Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.     The departure of Paul Manafort came as Trump tried this week to reset his unorthodox bid for the White House after falling behind Clinton in opinion polls for the Nov. 8 election.Trump said in a statement he had accepted Manafort's     resignation and praised his ""great work,"" but did not offer an explanation for the departure.   Trump aides say the staff changes usher in a greater focus on policy and a more serious tone. The former reality TV host has stuck to that mission, swapping his free-wheeling rally speeches for prepared remarks that stick to a singular theme. He has concentrated on immigration, trade deals and law and order.Speaking in Dimondale, Michigan, on Friday with the use of a teleprompter, Trump stayed clear of much of the hyperbole that has been a hallmark of his campaign.He attacked Clinton for her position on trade agreements, telling the Michigan crowd that the Democrat would send auto jobs to Mexico. Nonetheless, he appeared to stray at times from his prepared remarks, as when he said that black voters, who overwhelmingly tell pollsters they prefer Democratic candidates, should vote for him.""You're living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth are unemployed,"" Trump said. ""What the hell do you have to lose?""Trump, who has never held elected office, did not refer to his staffing changes, but in an interview earlier on Friday his son Eric Trump said unflattering headlines about Manafort had taken a toll.""I think my father didn't want to be, you know, distracted by, you know, whatever things that, you know, Paul was dealing with,"" he told the Fox News Channel's ""Sunday Morning Futures"", while also praising Manafort's work for the campaign.
Questions have arisen about Manafort's previous work for the political party of the Kremlin-backed former Ukrainian leader, Viktor Yanukovich. Federal investigators from the U.S. Department of Justice are examining American ties to corruption in Ukraine, CNN reported on Friday. The investigation is looking at the work of Manafort's firm and another lobbying firm, the Podesta Group, headed by Tony Podesta, whose brother, John Podesta, is chairman of Clinton's presidential campaign.CLINTON POLL LEAD
Clinton leads Trump by 8 percentage points among likely voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Friday. The Aug. 14-18 online poll showed that Clinton was supported by 42 percent of Americans who are expected to vote, compared with 34 percent for Trump. Some 23 percent would not side with either candidate. 
On Wednesday, Trump overhauled his campaign team, hiring the head of conservative website Breitbart News, Stephen Bannon, as chief executive of the campaign in a move that bolstered his combative image. Trump also promoted adviser Kellyanne Conway, a data-driven political analyst, to campaign manager.In a previous shake-up, Manafort, who first joined the team in March, took over the running of the campaign from Corey Lewandowski, who was fired as campaign manager in June.    The Clinton campaign has pointed to Manafort's Ukraine work and favorable comments that Trump has made about Russian President Vladimir Putin to sow questions in voters' minds about whether the Russian government has an unseen hand in the U.S. election. Russian officials have rejected that accusation.""You can get rid of Manafort, but that doesn't end the odd bromance Trump has with Putin,"" Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, said in a statement.'TOO MANY COOKS'

John Feehery, a Republican strategist, said it would have been unsustainable for Manafort to stay on after Wednesday's hires. ""Too many cooks in the kitchen,"" he said.Trump's hiring of Bannon was seen as a sign he would not hold back in his aggressive, unorthodox campaign manner. Still, Trump offered rare words of regret on Thursday for any time he had caused ""personal pain"" with his take-no-prisoners style. On Friday, he also began airing his first television advertisement since becoming the Republican candidate, buying airtime in the crucial states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Florida, where Clinton has already spent of millions in television advertising. The 30-second ad focuses on immigration, saying Clinton would allow ""terrorists and dangerous criminals"" into the country, a charge her campaign dismisses.Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute conservative think tank, said Trump still had some time to turn around his campaign, noting the news of the shakeup came as many Americans were enjoying summer vacations. The final stretch of the protracted campaign traditionally starts after Labor Day, which falls on Sept. 5 this year.""I'm not sure the public pays a lot of attention to inside campaign stories,"" she said. ""But that said, Trump has clearly been having significant problems in the polls and he needed to do something differently and perhaps this is the beginning of the attempt.""Clinton won some relief on Friday from a controversy over her use of a private email system when she was secretary of state. A U.S. federal judge ruled that Clinton did not need to give sworn testimony in a lawsuit about the email issue.

WASHINGTON The FBI and U.S. Justice Department are investigating possible U.S. ties to alleged corruption involving the former president of Ukraine, including the work of firms headed by political operatives Paul Manafort and Tony Podesta, CNN reported on Friday, citing multiple U.S. law enforcement officials.The broad-based investigation was looking into whether U.S. companies and the financial system were used to enable corruption by the party of former pro-Russian Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, CNN said.A person who answered a telephone number for Manafort said Manafort was not available for comment. The person, who said he was an associate of Manafort and who gave his name only as David, referred queries to a lawyer in Washington, who did not immediately respond to a phone call and an email.In response to a report in the New York Times on Monday, Manafort denied any impropriety in a statement. ""I have never received a single 'off-the-books cash payment' as falsely 'reported' by The New York Times, nor have I ever done work for the governments of Ukraine or Russia,"" he said.The New York Times reported that he had received cash payments worth more than $12 million over five years that were itemized on secret ledgers belonging to Yanukovich's Party of Regions.
Manafort, who resigned as chairman of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's campaign on Friday, had not been the focus of the probe, CNN said, citing the officials.The probe was looking at the work of other firms linked to the former Ukrainian government, including the Podesta Group, a lobbying and public relations company headed by Tony Podesta, whose brother John Podesta is chairman of the campaign to elect Democratic Party presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.Manafort's attorney Richard Hibey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The FBI declined to comment, CNN reported.The Podesta Group has hired an independent legal firm to investigate whether it had been misled by the Centre for a Modern Ukraine, a not-for-profit group linked to the ousted Ukrainian government, a spokeswoman for the group said in a statement.
The Justice Department, asked to comment on the report, said it remained ""committed to helping recover stolen assets on behalf of the people of Ukraine."" Investigators in Ukraine have said Yanukovych and his party engaged in widespread corruption. He fled to Russia following a popular uprising in 2014.

By Bryn Stole
| BATON ROUGE, La.

BATON ROUGE, La. U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump toured flood-battered Louisiana on Friday, shrugging off the Democratic state governor's plea for politicians not to stop in areas affected by deadly rains.President Barack Obama said he was also eager for a firsthand look at the damage done by floods that damaged more than 40,000 homes and killed at least 13 people, announcing plans to visit Baton Rouge on Tuesday.Obama's travel requires a massive retinue of Secret Service agents and assistance from local and state law enforcement officials, so the White House usually waits to visit disaster zones to avoid tying up police and emergency resources needed elsewhere.  On Friday, Trump's motorcade drove past piles of possessions and building materials that had been ripped out of flooded homes en route to Greenwell Springs Baptist Church in a hard-hit portion of East Baton Rouge Parish. ""You're going to be fine,"" Trump told several dozen supporters gathered outside, many asking for autographs and selfies. The deluge that dumped more than 2-1/2 feet (0.76 meter) on parts of Louisiana has been described as the worst U.S. disaster since Superstorm Sandy in 2012.Trump told reporters he came to help out, joined by vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, in a visit to a state that is typically a Republican stronghold in presidential elections. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards' office, however, had said Trump did not call to discuss plans.""We welcome him to (Louisiana), but not for a photo op,"" the governor's office said in a statement, urging Trump to volunteer or make ""a sizable donation.""
Trump told reporters he believed Obama should have cut short a vacation on Martha's Vineyard in New England to visit the area of flood devastation.Trump told reporters he believed Obama should have cut short a vacation on Martha's Vineyard in New England to visit the area of flood devastation.Some Louisianans and others, using the hashtag #wheresobama and #laflood on Twitter, had urged Obama to visit, and Baton Rouge's newspaper, The Advocate, voiced a similar view in an editorial published on Wednesday. (bit.ly/2bDpiiP)Obama's vacation is due to end on Sunday. The White House said the president's advisers had determined, in consultation with state officials, that Tuesday was an appropriate time to visit.
""The president is mindful of the impact that his travel has on first responders and wants to ensure that his presence does not interfere with ongoing recovery efforts,"" the White House said in a statement.Obama planned to visit Baton Rouge, the state's capital city, which saw wide flooding. The White House said he would talk to local officials about what more the federal government can do to assist in the recovery.The president has declared much of the state a federal disaster, freeing up emergency resources. He has been receiving updates from U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate, who both have visited Louisiana.In 2005, then-President George W. Bush, a Republican, drew criticism for flying over extensively damaged New Orleans, Louisiana, and then giving a speech in the still-flooded city following Hurricane Katrina. 
Some 86,500 people have already filed for federal aid following the historic levels of rainfall. The state expected 4,000 would still need refuge in shelters on Friday night. Entire neighborhoods must now contend with flood-hit homes.""We're talking about an awful lot of people, which is why we are trying to turn on the assistance as soon as possible,"" Edwards said at a news conference on Friday afternoon, offering details on temporary housing.He spoke earlier in the day with Trump's Democratic rival in the Nov. 8  election, Hillary Clinton, she said on social media. ""My heart breaks for Louisiana, and right now, the relief effort can't afford any distractions,"" she said on Facebook, directing people to support organizations providing assistance. Yet Kellie Michelli, who lost her home in the flood and was also at the church to pick up food with her family, beamed as she showed off an autograph on a Trump hat from an earlier rally in Baton Rouge.""He took time out of his busy schedule to come here,"" Michelli said. ""I don't care if he gives a nickel, he showed he cared by coming here.""
