By Emily Stephenson
| MIAMI

MIAMI Donald Trump on Friday called for disarming the bodyguards who protect his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, and mused about the consequences of such a move by saying ""Let's see what happens to her.""    The Republican presidential nominee was speaking at a rally in Miami, where he contrasted his supporters, who he said back police and want crime reduced, to Clinton, who he derided as someone who ""lives behind walls and raises money from hedge funds.""""I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons. They should disarm. I think they should disarm immediately, what do you think, yes?,"" he said.""Take their guns away, she doesn't want guns. Take them, let's see what happens to her. Take their guns away, okay. It will be very dangerous.""Both candidates have been protected by the Secret Service for months, but Trump's latest take on Clinton's security detail brought swift denunciations, particularly from Clinton allies. ""Tonight, Donald Trump once again alluded to violence against Hillary Clinton,"" said Elizabeth Shappell, spokeswoman for Correct The Record, a pro-Clinton media watchdog group.
""This is a truly deplorable comment that betrays our nation's most fundamental democratic values,"" Shappell said in a statement.Stuart Stevens, a Washington-based political consultant who worked on Republican Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign, tweeted: ""The Secret Service should investigate this threat""  Trump made a similar comment about Clinton and her armed protection in May while accepting the endorsement of the National Rifle Association, when he said Clinton would end the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment, which guarantees the right to bear arms. 
""Let's see how they feel walking around without their guns or their bodyguards,"" he told the gun lobby group, speaking about Clinton and her Secret Service detail.  Trump was criticized by opponents last month when he suggested that gun rights activists could act to stop Clinton from nominating liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices, a comment some interpreted as encouraging a political assassination.""If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks,"" Trump told a rally in North Carolina on Aug. 9. ""Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don't know,"" he continued.
Clinton has called for tighter access to guns, including universal background checks, but has never said she planned to get rid of the Second Amendment. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said Friday's remarks fall into a pattern of Trump inciting people to violence. ""Whether this is done to provoke protesters at a rally or casually or even as a joke, it is an unacceptable quality in anyone seeking the job of Commander in Chief,"" Mook said in a statement.

MIAMI Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Friday that if elected he would seek to reverse President Barack Obama's moves to open relations with Cuba unless the leaders there allowed religious freedoms and freed political prisoners. ""The next president can reverse them, and that I will do unless the Castro regime meets our demands,"" Trump said at a rally in Miami, which has a large Cuban population.

By Steve Holland and Emily Stephenson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Friday abandoned his false claim that Barack Obama was not born in the United States after spending five years peddling conspiracy theories that the country's first African-American president started life as a foreigner.But, never one to let a controversy go without fanning its flames, Trump accused Hillary Clinton, his Democratic rival in the Nov. 8 election, of starting the so-called birther movement in her failed 2008 presidential campaign against Obama, a claim that does not stand up to scrutiny.Trump, who has won back some ground in opinion polls and made the White House race more competitive after he went through a summer slump, made his announcement in an attempt to clear the air as he prepares for the first of three televised presidential debates with Clinton on Sept. 26.""President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period,"" said Trump, a real estate developer. ""Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again,"" he said at an event in Washington at a new Trump International Hotel down the street from the White House.Devoting only about 30 seconds to the subject, Trump did not apologize and did not expand upon his abrupt decision to shift from a stance he held for five years.The New York businessman brought up the birther controversy as far back as 2011, appealing to a right-wing fringe of voters who formed the early base of his support when he launched his presidential bid last year.The birther conspiracy movement is aimed at challenging the legality of Obama's presidency - the U.S Constitution requires that a president be a natural-born citizen.During his presidential campaign, Trump has readily trafficked in other theories that are the stuff of American supermarket tabloids.There was his declaration that the father of U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, one of Trump's many rivals for the Republican nomination, might have been linked to the assassin of President John F. Kennedy. And there was his false claim that thousands of Muslims in Jersey City, New Jersey, cheered when the World Trade Center twin towers collapsed in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.In making his announcement on Friday, Trump advanced a widely debunked claim that Clinton and her 2008 campaign had been the original birthers.""Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. You know what I mean,"" he said.His campaign directed reporters to a 2007 memo from then-Clinton adviser Mark Penn, who had encouraged the Clinton campaign to go negative against Obama by saying that his Hawaiian birth and boyhood in Indonesia gave him limited roots in American values and culture.
Penn eventually left the Clinton campaign, and his advice was never acted upon.    ""A NEW LIE""
The Democratic National Committee on Friday condemned Trump's bid to link Clinton to the birther idea. ""He had the audacity to spout a new lie about the birther movement that he helped to build,"" it said.Clinton, who leads Trump by 4 percentage points in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, on Friday demanded Trump apologize to the president for having helped spread the birther idea and said Trump had tried to ""delegitimize our first black president.""""His campaign was founded on this outrageous lie. There is no erasing it in history,"" Clinton said in an address to the Black Women's Association in Washington.Clinton seized on the issue after struggling to overcome the fallout from her remark a week ago that half of Trump's supporters are in a ""basket of deplorables"" and her initial secrecy about her pneumonia diagnosis.
Obama, who produced the longer version of his Hawaiian birth certificate in 2011 to prove doubters wrong, had famously mocked Trump over the issue at a White House Correspondents Association dinner as the wealthy businessman sat in the audience fuming.Still, Trump clung to the contention that Obama was foreign-born, tweeting in August 2012: ""An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud.""On Friday, Obama was asked for his reaction to the latest Trump declaration.""I'm shocked that a question like that has come up at a time when we have so many other things to do. Well, I'm not that shocked actually. It's fairly typical. We've got other things to attend to,"" he said. ""I was pretty confident about where I was born.""Trump's embrace of the birther movement has incensed black Americans, whose votes Trump has been trying to court.Members of the Congressional Black Caucus held a news conference on Friday to urge African-American voters to resist any temptation to support Trump.
""I'm wondering when this country is going to awaken from this reality show,"" said Representative Brenda Lawrence, a Democrat.First lady Michelle Obama told a crowd in Fairfax, Virginia, that her husband has set a strong example for those who have doubted ""whether my husband was even born in this country.""""Well, during his time in office, I think Barack has answered those questions with the example he's set: by going high when they go low. And he's answered these questions with the progress that we've achieved together,"" she said.At a rally in Miami later on Friday, Trump pushed back on the idea that he and his supporters were racist, saying that when Democrats are in trouble politically, ""they always pull out the racist word.""He walked out at the rally to a song from the musical ""Les Miserables"" in front of a backdrop that read ""Les Deplorables,"" a reference to Clinton's comment last week about his supporters.The issue of Obama's birthplace has not been a factor in the campaign leading up to the November presidential election, but it resurfaced in recent days, taking the focus of Trump's White House bid away from topics such as immigration, trade and the economy, which he has been using to hit Clinton.Trump revived the birther controversy on Thursday in an interview with The Washington Post when he declined to say whether he believed Obama was born in Hawaii.    Trump had promised ""a big announcement"" about the birther issue on Friday, giving the impression it was the purpose of the event at his hotel. Instead, he held off saying anything about it through more than 20 minutes of endorsements from military veterans. Only then did Trump make a brief statement about Obama's birth.Trump devoted more time at the beginning of the event to talking about his hotel where the event took place. He ignored reporters' shouted questions.

By Jeff Mason
| FAIRFAX, Va.

FAIRFAX, Va. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign deployed a popular surrogate on Friday to gin up enthusiasm amid young voters who could be critical to victory on Nov. 8: Michelle Obama.The U.S. first lady and wife of President Barack Obama, who won the White House in 2008 and 2012 with high levels of support from young voters, told a crowd of students in Virginia that they could mean the difference between a Clinton win or a loss to Republican nominee Donald Trump.""Let's be clear, elections aren't just about who votes, but who doesn't vote. And that is especially true for young people like all of you,"" she said, noting that voters under the age of 30 provided the margin of victory for Obama in the swing states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida and Virginia in 2012.""Without those votes, Barack would have lost those states and he definitely would have lost that election. Period, end of story,"" she said.A New York Times/CBS poll this week showed Clinton with more support from people under 30 than Trump but still well below the levels Obama achieved. 
Though she has not yet been a frequent presence on the 2016 campaign trail, Mrs. Obama has proven to be an especially powerful advocate for Clinton, her husband's one-time rival. Her speech in support of Clinton at the Democratic convention in July was praised as one of the best of that event.""I'm inspired,"" she said, listing Clinton's positions in public service and rejecting arguments that Clinton was not an inspiring figure. The current first lady praised the former first lady as one of the most qualified people for the office of president in history.""So we cannot afford to squander this opportunity, particularly given the alternative. Because here is what we know: that being president isn't anything like reality TV,""  Mrs. Obama said, referring to Trump, a former reality television host.
A president could not just ""pop off"" when making life or death decisions about war and peace, she said without naming Trump.  Mrs. Obama noted that the country was in a time of transition, just like her family, which was about to move into a new house. She joked that they had to make sure the White House was cleaned up so they could get their security deposit back.
Then she referred to the transition in 2008 with a dig at Trump for questioning whether Barack Obama was born in Hawaii. On Friday he finally conceded that Obama was U.S. born.""There were those who questioned, and continued to question for the past eight years, up through this very day, whether my husband was even born in this country,"" she said to boos.""I think Barack has answered those questions with the example he's set: by going high when they go low.""

WASHINGTON Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein have failed to quality for the first planned U.S. presidential debate on Sept. 26, the Commission on Presidential Debates said on Friday.The commission, citing the averages the various candidates have achieved in selected polls, confirmed that Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton had met the criteria.It also said that the vice presidential running mates of the two leading candidates were the only two to qualify for the vice presidential debate set for Oct. 4.The first presidential debate will be held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York and the vice presidential debate at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia.Using the average of five national polls, Clinton scored 43 percent, Trump 40.4 percent, Johnson 8.4 percent and Stein 3.2 percent, the commission said. Selection for the debates requires at least 15 percent support.
Johnson and Stein were both constitutionally eligible and had ballot access in enough states to theoretically win an electoral college majority, but missed the polling threshold.Stein's campaign website said she and her running mate Ajamu Baraka will both attend the first presidential debate, and urged supporters to join them. The campaign said it might ask supporters to attempt to escort the candidates into the debate in an action that ""may lead to arrest -- it is possible but not definite. There will be actions you can take with us at Hofstra that do not risk arrest.""
The campaign said it is ""organizing nonviolent civil resistance training for this.""Johnson said in a statement that: ""I would say I'm surprised that the CPD has chosen to exclude me from the first debate, but I'm not.""
The commission was a private organization created by the Republican and Democratic parties ""for the clear purpose of taking control of the only nationally televised presidential debates voters will see,"" Johnson said.The last time a third-party candidate was allowed to participate in the televised debates was in 1992, when Ross Perot met the requirements running as an independent.

PARIS Edinson Cavani silenced his critics when he scored four goals in Paris St Germain's 6-0 victory at Caen in Ligue 1 on Friday.    The Uruguay striker, who wasted a handful of chances in the French champions' 1-1 home draw against Arsenal in the Champions League on Tuesday, found the back of the net four times before the break in a one-sided encounter.    The result meant that PSG, who had bagged only one point from their last two league encounters, move to the top of the standings with 10 points from five games.   Monaco, Girondins de Bordeaux and Nice, among others, could take over at the top depending on Saturday's results.   
Cavani opened the scoring after 12 minutes when he latched onto a Maxwell cross from the left and doubled the tally from the penalty spot after Syam Ben Youssef fouled Lucas in the box.Maxwell again set up Cavani for the third, the forward tapping in from a cross at the near post seven minutes from the break.   Cavani added a fourth on the stroke of halftime, poking the ball home from Thomas Meunier's cross.
Unai Emery's side's domination continued after the break as Lucas fired home from just outside the box in the 67th.   Forward Jean-Kevin Augustin added a sixth, converting Adrien Radiot's assist 11 minutes from time.

By Roberta Rampton
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Ohio's Republican governor, John Kasich, took over the White House briefing lectern on Friday to praise the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, an unusual move that shows how hard President Barack Obama will push for the trade deal's approval.Obama, a Democrat who is leaving office in four months, met with the governor, who fell short in his bid to be the Republican presidential candidate, in the White House Oval Office to discuss strategies for overcoming domestic political angst over the TPP.The unlikely partnership comes as the White House makes a final full-court push to persuade Republican congressional leaders to approve the deal in a ""lame duck"" session after the Nov. 8 election. Both Republican and Democratic candidates have pilloried the TPP.""We cannot get to the point in America that because a Democrat wants something, you can't agree with them,"" Kasich said in an impassioned plea to Republican lawmakers to back the deal, which is a key part of Obama's foreign policy legacy.Kasich said the deal is vital for the U.S. economy and also to counter China and Russia, and said business leaders need to apply pressure on lawmakers to approve it.""Right now, China is pushing hard to create their own trade agreement,"" Obama told reporters in the Oval Office ahead of the meeting, saying U.S. businesses were at risk of being ""cut out"" of Asia, the world's fastest-growing market.
""I promise you that China's not going to be setting up a bunch of rules that are going to be to the advantage of American companies and American businesses,"" Obama said.Other business and political leaders also attended the meeting, including former Republican Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, International Business Machines Corp Chief Executive Officer Virginia Rometty and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.Republicans traditionally have backed free trade deals, but the party's presidential candidate, Donald Trump, has blamed the agreements for U.S. job losses and threatened to tear them up should he win.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the TPP would not get a Senate vote this year, and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan has said he does not see enough votes for it to pass.Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has also opposed the deal, which is unpopular with labor unions and environmental groups.Obama has said he hopes opposition cools after the election. The White House has pointed to opinion polls showing most Americans support trade as a sign that the TPP could still squeak through Congress.
""If you're frustrated about rules of trade that disadvantage America, if you're frustrated about jobs being shipped overseas ... then you want to get this thing passed,"" Obama told reporters.On his final trip to Asia as president earlier this month, Obama spent time reassuring nervous partners that the United States would finalize the TPP. But on Friday, Vietnam's parliament indicated it would not ratify the deal quickly.White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Vietnam's decision was not a setback. ""I think the real stumbling block, the real impediment, the obstacle here is (the U.S.) Congress,"" Earnest said, noting there was ""every indication"" that Vietnam would proceed as long as Congress approved the TPP.

By Gabriel Stargardter

 (This Sept 15 story corrects ""asked"" in first paragraph to ""raised with"" California lawmakers)By Gabriel StargardterMEXICO CITY Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, who has proposed liberalizing his country's drug laws, privately raised with California lawmakers visiting Mexico a state measure to legalize recreational marijuana, a state legislator said on Thursday.A delegation of California Democratic lawmakers visiting Mexico talked for an hour on Wednesday with Pena Nieto about trade and the state's border with Mexico.During the meeting, Pena Nieto brought up the November ballot measure without getting into details, California state Senator Ben Allen said in an interview.""But they're clearly paying close attention,"" he added.
If California votes to create a legal cannabis market, it would place great pressure on Mexico, which is mired in combating its vast drug-trafficking networks, to follow suit. There was no mention of the California marijuana initiative in the presidency's report on the meeting, and Pena Nieto's office did not immediately respond to request for comment.Pena Nieto has said the United States and Mexico should not pursue diverging policies on marijuana legislation and in April proposed a bill to allow Mexicans to carry up to an ounce of marijuana has stalled in Congress.
California's proposal would allow people over 21 years to possess up to an ounce of marijuana for private use and establish a system to license, regulate and tax sales of cannabis. Recent polls show a majority of Californians favor legalizing marijuana.
Four U.S. states plus the District of Columbia already allow recreational use for adults. Voters in several more states, including the southern border state of Arizona, will consider similar legislation in November.Long regarded as a conservative on drug policy, Pena Nieto has modified his stance since he took office in 2012, reflecting growing Latin American disenchantment with the war on drugs. A bill to legalize medical marijuana remains in Congress. Ethan Nadelmann, the executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, said he eventually expects Mexico to be swayed by the fiscal opportunities of regulated cannabis, which he believes could earn California around $1 billion a year in tax revenue.
