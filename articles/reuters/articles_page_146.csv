By Michelle Conlin
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK A group of at least six wealthy Republican donors is urging the billionaire Koch brothers to step off the sidelines of the U.S. presidential election to back Donald Trump, arguing they will want influence with the New York businessman they have harshly criticized if he wins the White House in November.The financiers, prominent members of the sprawling 700-member Koch donor network, have been making their case in emails and phone calls to Charles and David Koch ahead of their bi-annual donor seminar, which begins Saturday in Colorado, according to four donors involved in the loosely-coordinated effort and advisers representing two others.An endorsement from the Kochs would be a radical departure: The industrialist brothers have railed against Trump's ""monstrous"" rhetoric and protectionist policies on immigration and trade. They have said they will not get involved in the presidential election and will instead focus on Senate races. All the while, Trump has blasted the donor class and vowed not to become a ""puppet"" of outside interests as he campaigns to win the Nov. 8 election. But there is room for a detente. Trump's vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, has long been a darling of the Koch network, and Trump's fledgling campaign finance operation could use a cash injection as it faces a $1 billion general election battle against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.""I don't think it's impossible, or beyond the realm of possibility, that at some point the Kochs are going to get involved,"" said Doug Deason, a member of the Koch network.Deason, who has met with Trump and his confidantes, said he and his father, the billionaire Darwin Deason, had proposed to Charles Koch in an email that he meet the Republican nominee in person.
""We think it's really important that Donald convince Charles he's the right guy, and for Charles to influence Donald's policies,"" said Deason. Charles Koch ""indicates he's taking a wait and see approach. He's not completely writing if off.""An adviser to another major Koch network donor added: ""Some of the Koch donor class this weekend is surely going to say, 'Hey, guys, get on board.'""A spokesperson for Trump, who is scheduled to hold two campaign events in Colorado on Friday, did not respond to a request for comment. James Davis, a spokesman for the Koch's political operation, Freedom Partners Action Fund, declined comment.The billionaire donors eyeing Trump stress they believe it is urgent for the Koch brothers' conservative thinking to start to influence Trump before the election while he is still fine-tuning policy and considering possible Cabinet picks.
MIX OF OPINIONS
The Koch network, made up of the wealthiest conservative families in America, rivals both the Republican and Democratic parties in both its resources and scope. Membership requires a payment of at least $100,000 per year.But it is by no means a monolithic group. 
At their donor summit last January in Palm Springs, California, most donors seemed vehemently opposed to Trump among the large field of other Republican options. But now that Trump has won the nomination, vanquishing 16 opponents in the primaries, some see little option but to back him.Broadcast magnate Stanley Hubbard, who had opposed Trump earlier in the year but now wants the Kochs to support him, said he was most concerned by the prospect of a Democrat nominating people to vacancies on the Supreme Court. ""A lot of us are giving a lot of money to the Kochs, and what we would expect is that they would do all they can to see to it that the right Supreme Court justices are selected,"" Hubbard said. ""Supreme Court justices will last a lot longer than any president."" He said he hoped the weekend confab in Colorado would persuade the Kochs to rethink Trump. ""If nothing else, the Kochs better ask for a show of hands,"" said Hubbard, ""and I think most people in the room this weekend will say, 'Yes, you need to get involved.'""

ASPEN, Colo. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, speaking about the hack of Democratic Party emails, said on Thursday the U.S. intelligence community was not ready to ""make the call on attribution"" as to who was responsible.The White House said earlier the FBI had not disclosed any information about who was behind the hack.Cyber security experts and U.S. officials said on Monday there was evidence that Russia engineered the release of sensitive Democratic Party emails in order to influence the U.S. presidential election.The emails were released by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, and appeared to show that the Democratic National Committee favored Hillary Clinton over her chief rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. Clapper, speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, acknowledged that ""there's just a few usual suspects out there"" who might be responsible for the cyber intrusion, suggesting it was the work of a nation-state rather than an independent hacking group. 
""We don't know enough to ascribe motivation,"" he said. ""Was this just to stir up trouble, or was this ultimately to try to influence an election? That's a serious proposition.""Russian officials have dismissed the allegations of Moscow's involvement.
""It is so absurd it borders on total stupidity,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. ""The Americans need to get to the bottom of what these emails are themselves and find out what it's all about.""Clapper said comments by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump questioning U.S. alliances in Europe and Asia had rattled foreign intelligence and security officials.
While declining direct comment on Trump's remarks, he said:        ""Such statements, such rhetoric are very bothersome to our foreign interlocutors, our foreign partners. I hear that from counterparts, intelligence and security colleagues in many other countries. ... It is a worry to them, it really is.""

By Andrew Osborn and Maria Tsvetkova
| MOSCOW

MOSCOW Russia told the United States on Thursday to get to the bottom of a hacking scandal involving Democratic Party emails itself and rejected what Donald Trump said was a sarcastic suggestion that Moscow should dig up Hillary Clinton's ""missing"" emails.  Trump, the Republican Party's presidential candidate, angered Democrats on Wednesday by inviting Russia to unearth tens of thousands of emails from rival Clinton's tenure as U.S. secretary of state.He spoke out after President Barack Obama said it was possible Russia might try to influence the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election after a leak of Democratic National Committee emails that experts blamed on Russian hackers. Suggestions of Russian involvement have riled the Kremlin, which has categorically denied this and accused U.S. politicians of seeking to play on Cold War-style American fears of Moscow by fabricating stories for electoral purposes.President Vladimir Putin has tried to avoid giving the impression of favoring any U.S. candidate, while hailing the populist Trump as being ""very talented"". Russian state TV coverage has tended to tilt towards Trump over Clinton.   On Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said accusations of a Russian hand in hacking Democratic Party emails bordered on ""total stupidity"" and were motivated by anti-Russian sentiment. He rejected Trump's apparently sarcastic suggestion for Russia to dig up Clinton's emails point-blank.
""As regards these (email) batches, that is not our headache. We never poke our noses into others' affairs and we really don't like it when people try to poke their nose into ours,"" he said. ""The Americans need to get to the bottom of what these emails are themselves and find out what it's all about.""Trump, who has repeatedly said he would strive for better U.S. relations with Russia if he won the presidency, also raised eyebrows by saying he would consider recognizing Ukraine's Crimea as part of Russia, which annexed the region in 2014.
Peskov said the Kremlin was unmoved by that comment, and it would not change what he says has been its neutral stance on U.S. presidential candidates.""We know perfectly well that candidates in the heat of a pre-election struggle say one thing, but that later, when under the weight of responsibility, their rhetoric becomes more balanced.""In response to Trump's remarks on Crimea, Ukraine's U.N. Ambassador Volodymyr Yelchenko said on Thursday: ""Mr. Trump is not the president of the United States, at least not yet.""
""Secondly, there are the well-known decisions of the United Nations. ... I'm pretty sure that any U.S. government will pay full respect to those decisions,"" he told reporters.  In March 2014, the 193-member United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring invalid Crimea's Moscow-backed referendum seceding from Ukraine. Analysts say the Kremlin would welcome a Trump victory in November because the wealthy New York businessman has repeatedly praised Putin, spoken of wanting to get along with Russia, and has said he would consider an alliance with Moscow against Islamic State.Trump's suggestion that he might abandon NATO's pledge to automatically defend all member states is also likely to have gone down well in Moscow, where the Western military alliance is cast as an outdated Cold War relic.

By Amy Tennery

Delegates at both the Republican and the Democratic conventions sported outrageous outfits - but the views from their respective gatherings were a study in contrast.Republican National Convention delegates in Cleveland last week embraced a freewheeling, policy-light lineup, reveling in messages of salvation from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's inner circle, while expressing their fears that America has become less safe. A man wearing an orange jumpsuit and Hillary Clinton mask told Reuters he had been asked to take pictures standing next to ""hundreds"" of convention-goers, while ""lock her up"" - a cry to imprison Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton - became the crowd's go-to chant. A woman wearing a red cape with ""TRUMP"" spelled out in twinkle lights happily posed for the dozens of passersby requesting photos.The few remaining, weary Ted Cruz supporters found a rallying cry in the former Republican presidential candidate's refusal to endorse Trump, a moment of party discord that prompted security to escort Heidi Cruz out of the convention hall and away from irate, yelling Trump supporters. At this week's Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, erstwhile candidate Bernie Sanders worked to build a bridge over troubled waters (yes, Paul Simon performed the song of that name). At the end of a roll call of state delegations, he called for Clinton to be nominated by voice vote - a show of support and a bid for unity after a bitter primary campaign.The move prompted deafening cheers on the convention floor - as well as a boos from Sanders supporters, who, on occasion, could be seen angrily arguing with Clinton backers.
And there were celebrities - actresses Eva Longoria, Lena Dunham, America Ferrera, Sigourney Weaver and Elizabeth Banks drew shrieks and cheers from the crowd. But Clinton's convention was heavy on policy and calls to public service. Former President Bill Clinton received a rock star's welcome before ticking off a list of his wife's civic accomplishments. First lady Michelle Obama drove some members of a rapt audience to tears when she declared, ""I wake up in a house built by slaves.""Reuters photographers caught up with several convention-goers, both Republican and Democrat, and asked ""If you could speak to your nominee, What would you like them to know about your hopes for the future of America?"" Here are some of their responses:""Thank you for having my back,"" Sharon Jackson, a delegate from Alaska at the Republican convention, said, referring to Trump.
Barbara Finger, a delegate from Wisconsin at the Republican conclave, also expressed gratitude to the New York businessman.""Keep going the way you are,"" she said. ""Make America great again.""Lavon Bracy, a Democratic delegate from Florida, expressed her support for Clinton at her party's convention, emphasizing the importance of unity.
She said she hopes, ""We can all live together in harmony and understand that we have differences and appreciate those who are different.""Democratic delegate Alvin Peters of Panama City, Florida, said he, too, hoped for brighter days.""Spread the joy,"" said Peters. ""Dispel the doom and gloom.""  Reuters photo slideshow: reut.rs/2aAmRRd (Reporting by Amy Tennery and Jim Young in Cleveland and Philadelphia; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"

By Doina Chiacu
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday tried to quell the furor over his call for Russia to find Hillary Clinton's deleted emails, saying he was being sarcastic.In Moscow, meanwhile, a Kremlin spokesman pointedly told Washington to solve its own email problems.Trump on Wednesday invited Russia to dig up tens of thousands of ""missing"" emails from Clinton's time at the U.S. State Department, prompting Democrats to accuse him of urging foreigners to spy on Americans.Later, he dismissed concerns raised by Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook that his comments raised national security concerns.""You have to be kidding. His client, his person, deleted 33,000 e-mails illegally. You look at that. And when I'm being sarcastic with something ..."" Trump said in a Fox News interview broadcast on Thursday.Asked if he was indeed being sarcastic, Trump snapped, ""Of course I'm being sarcastic. They don't even know, frankly, if it's Russia. They have no idea if it's Russia, if it's China, if it's somebody else. Who knows who it is?""But you have 33,000 (Clinton) emails deleted, and the real problem is what was said on those emails from the Democratic National Committee,"" he said, referring to hacked emails released last weekend by WikiLeaks.
The DNC emails showed party leaders favoring Clinton over her rival in the campaign for the nomination, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The committee is supposed to be neutral.Trump's explanation echoed those of his campaign advisers and other supporters, who immediately tried to pass his comments off as tongue-in-cheek and not serious.But the exhortation for a U.S. adversary to use cyber intrusions against an American political candidate drew criticism from intelligence experts and other public figures, including some Republicans.Trump made the remark at a news conference in Miami that allowed him to steal some of the limelight from the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, where Clinton on Thursday will accept her party's presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election.
""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, told reporters.He later said on Twitter that if anyone had Clinton's emails, ""perhaps they should share them with the FBI!""The Republican presidential nominee was referring to a private email system Clinton kept in her home in Chappaqua, New York, while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. She handed over thousands of emails in 2015 to U.S. officials probing that system, but did not release about 30,000 deleted emails she said were personal and not work-related.
Cyber security experts and U.S. officials have said there was evidence that Russia engineered the release of the sensitive Democratic Party emails to influence the election.But the Kremlin beat back those insinuations again on Thursday, saying they were driven by anti-Russian sentiment.""It is so absurd it borders on total stupidity,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. ""The Americans needs to get to the bottom of what these emails are themselves and find out what it's all about.""Although some Democrats have wondered aloud whether Trump committed a crime in his remarks directed at Russia, the prospect of any prosecution is considered nil because of the strong guarantee of speech rights in the United States.Charging Trump for his comments about Russia would ""turn campaign fluff into a crime"" and would be laughable, said Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor and former U.S.  prosecutor.

PARIS President Francois Hollande on Thursday fired back at comments by U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump that ""France was no longer France"" after a slew of militant attacks, saying France would always stay true to its values.France is reeling from two strikes in under two weeks by attackers who had pledged allegiance to Islamic State, the first when a Tunisian plowed his truck through a crowd in Nice, the second when two men slit the throat of a priest.""France is no longer France. They won't like me for saying that,"" Trump told reporters in Miami on Wednesday. ""And this world better be very careful and the better get very tough and they'll never do it with (Democratic nominee) Hillary Clinton.""Trump's campaign has been marked by insults and inflammatory rhetoric. He has called for tougher surveillance of mosques and warned that radical Muslims were ""trying to take over our children."" Trump has rejected the criticism that his rhetoric is racist.
Brushing off Trump's words, Hollande on Thursday told reporters France would always remain true to its values and ideals.
""When you stoop low you're not true to yourself anymore, that's something that can happen to others on the other side of the Atlantic,"" Hollande said, without directly mentioning Trump.

By Luciana Lopez and Amanda Becker
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON When it comes to trade policy, Hillary Clinton is taking heat from all sides.At the Democratic National Convention this week, where Clinton will formally accept her party's presidential nomination, opposition to trade deals was plastered on buttons, scrawled on signs and chanted by delegates. Many are worried by her past support of 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is still awaiting congressional approval.Things are unlikely to get any easier for her. Clinton has said her stance on trade has evolved, that she now opposes TPP because it does not do enough to protect jobs and that she wants changes in NAFTA, the trade deal her husband, Bill Clinton, signed during his presidency.But that allows her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, to question her credibility, painting Clinton's evolving position as a desperate attempt to catch up with his tough stance.Trump has vowed to force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate NAFTA, labeling it a job killer. The real estate developer has also said he would pull the United States out of the 12-nation TPP.Even among the Democrats there are doubts about Clinton's resolve, particularly among supporters of her former Democratic rival, Bernie Sanders, the U.S. Senator from Vermont whose opposition to trade deals featured prominently in his speeches during the Democratic primary season.The concern about trade was on display at the convention during a speech delivered on Wednesday night by Clinton's running mate, Tim Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia who once supported TPP. Delegates waved anti-TPP placards as Kaine spoke, even though he changed his position after joining Clinton's ticket.Larry Cohen, a senior adviser to Sanders, said trade was ""absolutely"" a danger for Clinton in the race against Trump, saying she had to show her commitment to opposing it and not just ""make pronouncements.""""The Trump campaign is smart enough that they will exploit this issue,"" Cohen said.
Sanders supporters have said they intend to keep fighting TPP through the November election via a new group called ""Our Revolution"" that is dedicated to championing issues that Sanders pushed on the campaign trail.The frustration that a post-recession recovery has failed to translate into better wages and opportunities for million of working Americans has become one of the leading themes of the 2016 presidential campaign.A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken in March showed that 65 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of Republicans believed that trade cost some U.S. jobs even though many also agreed that trade helps to keep the costs of goods low.Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO labor federation, told Reuters that Clinton has told all of the major unions that endorsed her that she wanted to re-work NAFTA, echoing similar comments by Dennis Williams, president of the United Auto Workers union.
'WHOLE NEW APPROACH'
Trumka said Clinton's campaign has told him that she would take ""a whole new approach"" on trade and he said he was convinced that he could trust her on the issue. ""She's not giving lip service to it. She's committed to it,"" he said.Consulted about Clinton's talks with unions regard NAFTA, a senior Mexican government official said the TPP already provided the United States with a platform to strengthen the rights of workers compared to NAFTA, although U.S. union activists say the new pact weakens rather than strengthens workers' protection.""They have the solution in their hands, if they back it,"" the official said, noting Congress had yet to ratify the TPP.
The official added that it would be in Mexico's interests to strengthen the rules of origin in TPP that determine which country a product comes from, but sometimes allow foreign components in it. He cautioned, however, that re-opening trade deals was a highly complex undertaking.Morris Fiorina, a political science professor at Stanford University, said Clinton should try to address workers' concerns but avoid a wholesale dismissal of free trade.""Were I advising her I'd suggest she try to thread the needle - explain that free trade has great benefits for the country as a whole, but past and pending agreements do not adequately recognize and compensate the losers. She will remedy that failure,"" Fiorina said.However, such nuanced approach may prove self-defeating in the light of Trump's challenge and internal dissent.Robin Biro, a field director for the Democratic Party in Atlanta and a Clinton supporter, said TPP was a make or break issue for Clinton to attract Democrats who voted for Sanders in the primary.""She's only going to get the support of the Bernie people if she comes out strongly on that issue,"" Biro said.

By John Walcott, Joseph Menn and Mark Hosenball
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Some U.S. intelligence officials suspect that Russian hackers who broke into Democratic Party computers may have deliberately left digital fingerprints to show Moscow is a ""cyberpower"" that Washington should respect. Three officials, all speaking on condition of anonymity, said the breaches of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) were less sophisticated than other cyber intrusions that have been traced to Russian intelligence agencies or criminals.For example, said one official, the hackers used some Cyrillic characters, worked during Russian government business hours but not on Russian religious or political holidays.""Either these guys were incredibly sloppy, in which case it's not clear that they could have gotten as far as they did without being detected, or they wanted us to know they were Russian,"" said the official.Private sector cyber security experts agreed that the evidence clearly points to Russian hackers but dismissed the idea that they intentionally left evidence of their identities.These experts - who said they have examined the breach in detail - said the Cyrillic characters were buried in metadata and in an error message. Other giveaways, such as a tainted Internet protocol address, also were difficult to find.Russian hacking campaigns have traditionally been harder to track than China's but not impossible to decipher, private sector experts said. But the Russians have become more aggressive and easier to detect in the past two years, security experts said, especially when they are trying to move quickly.False flags have grown more common, but the government and private experts do not believe that is involved in the DNC case.The two groups of hackers involved are adept at concealing their intrusions, said Laura Galante, head of global threat intelligence at FireEye, whose Mandiant subsidiary conducted forensic analysis of the attack and corroborated the findings of another cyber company, CrowdStrike.
Russian officials have dismissed the allegations of Moscow's involvement as absurd. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in his only response to reporters, said: ""I don't want to use four-letter words."" EMBARRASSING EMAILS 
While private cyber experts and the government were aware of the political party's hacking months ago, embarrassing emails were leaked last weekend by the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy group just as the Democratic Party prepared to anoint Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate for the Nov. 8 election.DNC chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, resigned after the leaked emails showed party leaders favoring Clinton over her rival in the campaign for the nomination, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The committee is supposed to be neutral.
The U.S. intelligence officials conceded that they had  based their views on deductive reasoning and not conclusive evidence, but suggested Russia's aim probably was much broader than simply undermining Clinton's campaign.They said the hack fit a pattern of Russian President Vladimir Putin pushing back on what he sees as the United States and its European allies trying to weaken Russia.""Call it the cyber equivalent of buzzing NATO ships and planes using fighters with Russian flags on their tails,"" said one official.Two sources familiar with Democratic Party investigations into the hacking said the private email accounts of Democratic Party officials were targeted as well as servers. 
They said that the FBI had advised the DNC that it was looking into the hacking of the individual officials' private accounts. They also said the FBI also requested additional information identifying the personal email accounts of certain party officials.The DNC hired CrowdStrike to investigate the hack. It spent  about six weeks, from late April to about June 11 or 12,  monitoring the systems and watching while the hackers - who they believed were Russian - operated inside the systems, one of the sources said.What actions, if any, the Obama administration will take are unclear and could depend on what diplomatic considerations may ultimately be involved, a former White House cyber security official said.In past cases, administration officials have decided to publicly blame North Korea and indict members of China's military for hacking because the administration decided that the net benefit of public shaming - and increased awareness brought to cyber security - outweighed potential risks, the former official said.But ""the Russia calculation is far more difficult and precarious,"" the former official said. ""Russia is a much more aggressive, capable foreign actor both in the traditional military sense and in the cyber realm"" and that made public attribution or covert retaliation much less likely.The former official, and a source familiar with the Democratic Party investigations, said that they also were unaware of any U.S. intelligence clearly demonstrating that WikiLeaks had received the hacked materials directly from Russians or that WikiLeaks' release of the materials was in any way directed by Russians.
