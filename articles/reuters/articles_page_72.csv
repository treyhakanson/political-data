WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama, highlighting his pledge to send people to Mars by the 2030s, on Tuesday announced further public-private efforts to build habitats that could help humans live long-term far from the Earth.""We are working with our commercial partners to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space. These missions will teach us how humans can live far from Earth - something we'll need for the long journey to Mars,"" Obama said in an opinion piece on CNN's website.His comments come ahead of a meeting planned by the White House in Pittsburgh this week to team up scientists, students and others to advance the commercial space market, Obama said. NASA separately said it was coordinating with commercial space companies to develop ""deep space habitat modules"" and create opportunities for companies to use the International Space Station's docking port.Obama has previously sought to boost space exploration and renewed that pledge on Tuesday: ""We have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America's story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time."" 
The two-term president's recommitment comes in the final months of his tenure and faces an uncertain future after he leaves office in January. His successors will be chosen on Nov. 8 in an election that could also reshape Congress, which allocates government funding.    Obama, a self-described ""nerd"" who last year hosted budding astronomers at the White House, has made known his love of space. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her rival, Republican Donald Trump, have given little, if any, attention to the issue on the campaign trail.
Humans have yet to travel to Mars, Earth's neighbor some 35 million miles (56 million km) away. Like Earth, the so-called Red Planet also has seasons, and a 2012 National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) mission found conditions there once supported microbial life, according to the U.S. space agency.It would take about eight months to get there, depending on rocket velocity, according to NASA experts. 
Efforts to fund the space program have faltered in recent years over concerns about fiscal priorities.As part of the space habitat effort, NASA said on Tuesday it was entering the so-called ""proving ground"" stage to demonstrate and test various technologies over the next 10 years.

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a challenge by Procter & Gamble Co and other companies to the way California imposes taxes on businesses that operate in multiple states.The justices left in place a December 2015 ruling by the California Supreme Court that California is not bound by a 1967 agreement between states that set a formula for calculating taxes. California, which joined the Multistate Tax Compact in 1974, changed the formula in 1993.California has since withdrawn from the state compact.
Several companies, including two Procter & Gamble subsidiaries, Kimberly-Clark Worldwide Inc and Merck KGaA subsidiary Sigma-Aldrich Corp, sued in 2010 after being denied refunds for the tax they paid between 1993 and 2005. The companies said they overpaid their taxes by $34 million.Lawyers for the companies had said $750 million in potential tax refunds in California and additional amounts in other states were at stake in the case.
Many states have moved away from the Multistate Tax Compact formula. To favor and attract businesses within their borders, these states have rearranged the way they tax business income so that in-state businesses pay less and out-of-state businesses pay more.

WASHINGTON Khizr Khan, the father of a decorated American soldier killed in Iraq, lashed out at Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Tuesday for saying his son would still be alive if Trump had been president at the time.""For this candidate to put his political expediency ahead of any realization of pain and suffering of the families is shameful,"" Khan said in an interview with CNN.The New York businessman raised the name of U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan in a Sunday night presidential debate while  criticizing Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for voting in favor of the 2003 invasion of Iraq when she was a U.S. senator.""If I was president at that time he would be alive today,"" Trump said. Despite his assertion that he always opposed the war, Trump had expressed support for it in a 2002 interview.
Khizr Khan had delivered a speech to the Democratic National Convention in July showcasing his son's military service and criticizing Trump's campaign call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country.Trump responded at the time by questioning whether Khan's wife, Ghazala Khan, was not ""allowed"" to speak when she appeared next to her husband on the stage, an insinuation of some conservative form of Islam that embroiled the candidate in an unpopular dispute with the Muslim parents of a fallen war hero. 
The Khans were stunned to hear Trump bring up the name of their son, who was killed in 2004, in Sunday's nationally televised debate, the father said.""We were not only shocked, we were saddened for such disingenuous expression of his thinking and of his feeling,"" Khan said.
Trump has said he has modified his call for a ban on Muslims entering the country to a plan for ""extreme vetting."" (Reporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Frances Kerry)"

By Michel Rose
| PARIS

PARIS Europe should challenge the United States over its increasingly aggressive use of extraterritorial laws that have cost European companies - especially banks - billions in fines and other settlements, a French parliamentary report said.Still reeling from the $9 billion fine its biggest bank, BNP Paribas, had to pay U.S. authorities over violations of American sanctions against other countries, the French government has criticized in recent years what it considers the over-reach of the U.S. legal system.Paris's main objections center on the U.S. Department of Justice's broad interpretation of what it considers its jurisdiction.This sphere of influence can include transactions between non-Americans outside the U.S. where the U.S. dollar currency is involved. It can also cover deals and other actions taking place via the Internet using U.S. computer servers.""We consider that today's situation amounts to abusive use of American law,"" Karine Berger, a lawmaker from the ruling Socialist party told Reuters in an interview, calling the practices akin to ""extortion"".""We ask France and Europe to let it be known to the United States that we will no longer accept this type of behavior.""In a non-binding investigative report last week, lawmakers from both the Socialist party and opposition conservatives said U.S. law appeared to be more punitive toward foreign firms than domestic ones.Although foreign firms accounted for only 30 percent of investigations opened by U.S. authorities between 1977 and 2014 under its anti-foreign bribery law, 67 percent of the amount levied in fines came from foreign companies, the report said.
Since 2009, European banks such as HSBC and Deutsche Bank have paid about $16 billion to the United States over breaches of various sanction regimes. European firms have also accounted for 14 of the 15 biggest penalties, the report said.The report did not question U.S. regulators' current prosecution of Deutsche Bank over mis-selling toxic mortgage securities before the financial crisis, since the actions took place in the United States.But it did say the DoJ had not taken account of the impact on the financial system that the $14 billion fine it sought from the German bank went on to have.Swiss bank Credit Suisse said on Sunday it has put five employees on leave while it investigates a tax-related matter. Swiss paper SonntagsZeitung reported that the move was connected to a U.S. probe of the bank's Israeli unit over possible tax evasion.
EUROPEAN ""REARMAMENT"" 
Berger said Europe's response had not been forceful enough, and that both the European Union and individual member states should adapt their own legislation, which is why the report will be sent to counterparts at other EU parliaments.""There must be a legal rearmament in Europe, so we fight on equal terms with the United States in the field of economic competition,"" Berger said.  
The European Union should consider challenging parts of the U.S. sanction regime at the World Trade Organisation, the report said, citing a 1998 precedent when Europeans successfully forced the U.S. to back down over Congressional sanctions against Cuba, Libya and Iran that could have affected European firms.The EU should update a 1996 ban on European firms complying with U.S. sanctions based on such extraterritorial legislation, giving European firms a legal ""excuse"" to reject U.S. demands.European countries and institutions should also encourage the use of the euro for global transactions and strengthen the use of intelligence services for economic means.Citing the recent EU ruling asking Apple to pay up to 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland, Berger said Europe should not be afraid to be more confrontational.""It shows Europe is perfectly capable of waging this economic war since the U.S. is only going to keep it up,"" she said.

By James Oliphant
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Hillary Clinton's campaign is confronting an emerging risk to her presidential ambitions - if Donald Trump continues to trail her in opinion polls many Democrats may simply stay at home on Election Day.Without enough popular support, Clinton would enter the White House lacking the political capital she would need to drive through her agenda. In the worst-case scenario it could cost her the presidency if Republicans turn out in big numbers on Nov. 8.     Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has spent much of her campaign sounding the alarm over the prospect of a President Trump. She has struggled to lay out a compelling vision for her presidency and has failed to excite key constituencies, including millennials, minority voters and liberal Democrats.Opinion polls show that many voters are backing Clinton primarily to stop Trump, the Republican nominee, from getting into the White House. If they believe he has no hope of winning, then what would their motivation be to turn up at the polls? In a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll about half of all Clinton supporters said they were backing her to keep Trump from winning. By contrast, just 36.5 percent said it was because of Clinton's policies and just 12.6 percent said it was because they like her personally. ""Turnout is correlated with levels of competition,"" said Michael McDonald, an elections expert at the University of Florida. ""The higher the competition, the higher the turnout.""The young Americans, blacks, Latinos, and low-income voters who make up much of the Democratic base often need to feel motivated by a particular candidate or issue to turn out, McDonald said, as was the case with President Barack Obama's candidacy in 2008. Clinton's campaign has long worried about voter complacency and has at every turn pushed the notion that the race is close and that Trump is unfit to be president. With her lead growing, that task grows more difficult.A Reuters/Ipsos 50-state survey (carried out before Friday's release of a video tape in which Trump makes vulgar remarks about women) gave the Democratic nominee a 95 percent chance of winning the election. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll on Monday showed Clinton with an 11-point lead nationally over Trump.
Low Democratic voter turnout could leave Trump an opening in swing states. And should Clinton win the election, a slim margin of victory could compound the challenge she will face in trying to govern a deeply divided nation. Clinton's campaign, however, will be able to rely on an extensive and well-funded voter mobilization effort, one that is expected to give her an edge over Trump's smaller organization. MOVING PAST TRUMP
The Clinton campaign insisted on Monday the race will remain tight. It sent out a new fundraising pitch to supporters, contending that Trump is ""an authoritarian threat"" for saying at Sunday's presidential debate that she would be in jail if he was president. 
Clinton must also contend with anger among liberal Democrats over leaked excerpts of paid speeches she made to banks and big business. The excerpts appeared to confirm their fears about her support for global trade and tendency to cozy up to Wall Street.Some liberals have also been waiting for Clinton to make a more positive case for her own presidency.""This election cannot be just a referendum on Donald Trump,"" said Arun Chaudhury, creative director of Revolution Messaging, a left-leaning consulting firm that oversaw the online media operation of former Clinton rival, Senator Bernie Sanders. Clinton's central message, he said, has been that ""everyone has to step up and stop Donald Trump from being president, not step up and make Hillary Clinton president."" ""The best campaign messages are comparative in nature,"" said Ben Turchin, a Democratic pollster who worked for Sanders' campaign. ""She can win by a bigger margin by giving a little more of an affirmative case for her presidency.""
While Clinton frequently goes on the attack against Trump, calling him racist, sexist and dangerous, her campaign insists it has been trying to get a positive, policy-oriented message out.""It is hard in this campaign when you're running against him and he generates so much controversy and therefore headlines,"" Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's communications director, told Reuters. ""It's hard to break through on any one day, and that's why we just have to keep at it.""The two candidates' central campaign slogans reflect their differing appeals to the electorate. Where Trump's is the change-oriented ""Make America Great Again,"" Clinton's is a more stolid ""Stronger Together,"" which speaks to rallying existing Democratic voters around her candidacy - and is a harder sell. Clinton's campaign seems to have recognized the need for some adjustments to its message. Since the presidential race intensified last month, Clinton has returned to the style of campaigning that helped her win early states in the Democratic nominating contests, holding smallish events focused on issues of most concern to core Democratic constituencies such as women and young voters. Turchin, the former Sanders pollster, said Clinton's efforts at fashioning a positive message were improving, although she is still having difficulty attracting the support of 18-to-34 year-old voters, among others. ""You've got to make the hard case over and over again,"" he said. ""She's got to convince people she shares their values.""

| NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES

NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES The television audience for the second debate between White House contenders Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton fell sharply from their first, record-breaking encounter, despite the drama caused by a 2005 video of Trump boasting about groping women.Nielsen data for 11 broadcast, cable and public television channels on Monday showed that some 66.5 million Americans tuned into the bitter 90-minute debate on Sunday, well below the record 84 million that watched the first face-off two weeks ago.The figures do not include millions more who watched the debate online, through social media or in bars and restaurants.Second presidential debates tend to attract smaller TV audiences, but attention was high going into Sunday's matchup after the emergence of the Trump video prompted several Republican politicians to abandon him. However, the second debate took place in the same time slot as NBC's popular ""Sunday Night Football,"" which was watched by about 15 million Americans, Nielsen data showed. NBC did not carry the debate.
While the National Football League game, along with Major League Baseball play-offs, likely pulled viewers away from the debate, many Americans already may have made up their minds on candidates, said Tom Hollihan, communication professor at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School.""When we get to mid-October, history tells us people have already made their decisions,"" he said. ""They lock themselves into their viewpoints and are less open to new information.""
The furor over the Trump tape and his attacks on Hillary Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, for alleged sexual misconduct also may have turned off some viewers.Sunday's debate, the second of three before the Nov. 8 election, was remarkable for the brutal nature of the exchanges between Trump and Clinton, his Democratic rival.  ""While in the past families might have made a commitment to watch a presidential debate, I think many in this case were saying, 'Why should I do that? Why should I have to answer my kids' questions about these topics?'"" Hollihan said.
The TV audience ranked below the nation's top 10 most-watched presidential encounters, and below that for President Barack Obama's first and second 2012 debates with Republican challenger Mitt Romney.Last week's vice presidential debate between Republican Mike Pence and Democrat Tim Kaine drew 37 million Americans - the lowest audience for a VP debate since 2000.

By Richard Cowan and Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Paul Ryan, the top Republican in the U.S. Congress, took the extraordinary step on Monday of distancing himself from Donald Trump, stirring a backlash from some lawmakers and deepening a crisis over his party's struggling presidential nominee.        In a conference call with congressional Republicans, Ryan all but conceded that Democrat Hillary Clinton was likely to win the White House on Nov. 8 and said he would put his full energy into preserving Republican majorities in Congress so as not to give her a ""blank check.""            Ryan, the speaker of the House of Representatives, said he would not defend Trump or campaign for him after the uproar over the New York businessman's sexually aggressive comments that surfaced on Friday.    Ryan's announcement added to the party's worst turmoil in decades and reinforced the growing sense of isolation around  Trump, who has never previously run for public office.Clinton has led Trump in most national opinion polls for months and Trump's poll numbers have begun to drop further since the emergence on Friday of a video from 2005 showing the former reality TV star bragging crudely about groping women and making unwanted sexual advances.  Trump hit back at Ryan, the Republican vice presidential candidate in 2012, who has frequently been critical of him.    ""Paul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. Ryan, who had expressed disgust over the tape and canceled a campaign event with Trump over the weekend, did not completely cut ties to Trump. The speaker went back on the Republican conference call later to clarify he was not withdrawing his endorsement.Many Republican members of Congress are concerned that Trump's chaotic campaign could ruin their chances of holding their majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in the November election and could inflict long-term damage on the party. During a weekend dominated by criticism of Trump over the lewd remarks, a string of members of Congress, governors and other prominent Republicans called on him to drop out of the race.House Republicans gave Ryan a rough ride on the call, according to some participants.
""There was an undeniable opposition to the speaker's tepid support of our nominee,"" said U.S. Representative Scott DesJarlais, a Trump supporter, in a comment passed on by an aide. Many other lawmakers, some of whom did not want to be named publicly criticizing the speaker, said members frequently told Ryan on the call to stand by Trump.Nonetheless, nearly half of all 331 incumbent Republican senators, Congress members and governors have condemned Trump's remarks, and roughly one in 10 has called on him to drop out of the race, according to a Reuters review of official statements and local news coverage.Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus used an afternoon conference call with RNC members to emphasize there was no rift with Trump and that the committee, the party's leadership and fundraising arm, still backed the nominee, two RNC members who spoke on condition of anonymity said.
RNC STILL ON BOARD
""Any suggestion that the RNC isn't fully supporting the Trump-Pence ticket is wrong,"" one RNC member said, describing the message. ""We are fully on board. We are going to devote every ounce of effort and resource into helping the Trump-Pence ticket win and all the other candidates up and down the ballot.""Any attempt to replace Trump on the ballot this close to Election Day would face huge legal and logistical hurdles.A defiant Trump went on the offensive in a vicious presidential debate on Sunday, saying Clinton, a former secretary of state would go to jail if he were president and attacking her husband, former President Bill Clinton, for his treatment of women.The debate, the second of three before the vote, was remarkable for the brutal nature of the exchanges between the two.Trump stayed on the attack on Monday, describing Bill Clinton as ""a predator"" and saying: ""If they want to release more tapes saying inappropriate things, we'll continue to talk about Bill and Hillary Clinton doing inappropriate things. There are so many of them.""
""She goes out and says: 'I love women, I'm going to help women.' She's a total hypocrite,"" he told supporters in Ambridge, Pennsylvania.Clinton accused Trump of brushing off criticism of his comments about women. ""On Friday, the whole world heard him talking about the terrible way he treats women. And last night when he was pressed about how he behaves, he just doubled down on his excuse that it's just locker room banter,"" she told a rally at Wayne State University in Detroit. The television audience for the debate fell sharply from their first, record-breaking encounter in September.    Nielsen data supplied by CNN for 10 broadcast and cable channels on Monday showed that 63.6 million Americans tuned into the 90-minute debate on Sunday, well below the record 84 million that watched the first face-off.    An NBC News/Wall Street Journal opinion poll released on Monday showed Clinton increasing her lead. The survey, conducted after the video release but before the debate, showed Clinton with 46 percent support among likely voters in a four-way matchup including two minor party candidates, compared with 35 percent for Trump.    The Reuters/Ipsos State of the Nation project released on Monday estimated that Clinton had at least a 95 percent chance of winning the 270 Electoral College votes needed to become president. The polling did not capture reaction to Trump's performance in Sunday's debate or the release of the Friday videotape.

By Ginger Gibson and Grant Smith
| WASHINGTON/NEW YORK

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK U.S. Republican Donald Trump has dismissed his vulgar sexual comments about women that surfaced on a video as ""locker room talk,"" but his explanation did little to soothe the queasiness of Esther Rosser, a 71-year-old grandmother from Virginia.""I know he apologized, and all you can do is apologize, but he could have said more,"" said Rosser, who has voted Republican her whole life but decided this weekend that she would support Trump's rival for president, Democrat Hillary Clinton.""He disrespected us,"" she said of Trump, referring to women in general.Rosser's misgivings echoed many of the sentiments expressed by more than two dozen women voters interviewed by Reuters who, as recently as September, had not decided whether they would support Trump or Clinton in the Nov. 8 U.S. election.In the informal survey conducted by phone the day after Sunday's presidential debate, many women said they were appalled by the 2005 video in which Trump bragged of kissing and groping women without consent. The video surfaced on the Washington Post's website on Friday afternoon. Several of the voters also said they disliked the Republican presidential candidate's strategy of highlighting the infidelities of Hillary Clinton's husband, Bill Clinton, in an effort to defend his own conduct, or shift attention away from it.""I didn't like the fact that he was attacking Hillary on things her husband did,"" said Connie Sasso, a 66-year-old retiree from Missouri. ""It's wrong - it's just wrong.""FLOORED, DISGUSTED

In the second presidential debate with Clinton on Sunday in St. Louis, Missouri, Trump said he was embarrassed by the video but dismissed his comments as ""locker room talk."" He also accused Hillary Clinton of attacking women who had alleged sexual misconduct by her husband, who was president from 1993 to 2001.Trump's criticism of Bill Clinton's infidelities drew applause from supporters at a Monday rally he held in Pennsylvania. But Trump, whose core voters are overwhelmingly male, has struggled to appeal to women, who made up 53 percent of the U.S. electorate in the 2012 election.If Trump is unable to narrow the gender gap, he will be unable to overcome Clinton's lead in the polls.""I can't with good conscience vote for someone with that kind of mindset to the presidency,"" said LeighAnn Chase, a 27-year-old nursing student from Lakeland, Florida. 
As a woman, she was ""floored"" by Trump's comments, and disgusted that others would seek to justify them, said Chase, a registered Republican who said she is now backing Clinton.Patsy Bennewise, 58, of North Little Rock, Arkansas, never voted for Clinton's husband during the nearly 10 years he was her state's governor. But her streak of never voting for a Clinton is set to end in November when she said she will cast her ballot for the Democratic candidate.She said of Trump: ""He's turned the presidential election into a mockery.""SOME STAY ON FENCE 

Not all undecided women voters contacted by Reuters came out against Trump. Amy Fryzelka, a 37-year-old tutor from Kansas City, Missouri, said she thought Trump's comments were ""horrible"" but she believed his personal life would not influence how he would govern. She said she is leaning toward the Republican candidate because she believes Clinton is too deceptive.""I'd prefer not to vote for either of them, really,"" Fryzelka said.Jane Simmons, 78, of Sterling Heights, Michigan, also said she would rather not vote for either Clinton or Trump. Simmons, whose mail-in ballot arrived on Friday, hours before she and other Americans learned of Trump's lewd comments, said the video led her to consider backing Clinton. ""This is an indication of what the man is, although it was a decade ago, I don't think he changed very much,"" she said. ""I don't believe he's got a conscience.""For Rosser, the Virginia grandmother, the decision to cast her vote for Clinton came when her 14-year-old granddaughter asked her to explain why Trump would say the things he said in the video.""He's not a good role model for kids,"" she said.

By Amanda Becker and Luciana Lopez

A longtime political adviser to Hillary Clinton last year urged her presidential campaign to support a new version of a law that separated commercial and investment banking to avoid antagonizing the Democratic Party's progressive wing, according to emails published by Wikileaks on Monday.Mandy Grunwald, an outside adviser to Clinton, urged Clinton's policy team in October 2015, just days before a Wall Street policy rollout, to consider endorsing a new version of the Glass-Steagall Act, according to an email reviewed by Reuters.The Glass-Steagall Act was a Depression-era law that prohibited commercial banks from engaging in risky trading activities. The 1933 law was repealed in 1999 during the presidency of Bill Clinton when he passed legislation removing barriers between commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies.Many Democratic activists believe that reinstating the Glass-Steagall law and breaking up large financial institutions would help prevent future financial crises such as the one that rocked the U.S. economy in 2008. Grunwald said if Clinton did not back a new Glass-Steagall, she risked alienating liberal U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, an outspoken critic of Wall Street who is popular in the left wing of the Democratic Party.
The Clinton campaign would neither confirm nor deny the authenticity of the latest batch of hacked emails of Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta released by Wikileaks.The U.S. government last week formally accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations, a charge Russia has denied. As a result, Clinton campaign officials and supporters have warned that such email releases could include fraudulent or misleading documents among genuine emails.At the time of Grunwald's email, Clinton's primary debates against her then-rival U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont were fast approaching. Grunwald worried that if Clinton did not support a new Glass-Steagall law, it would make it more difficult to defend her plan to curb Wall Street risk.
It could also prompt Warren to endorse Sanders, Grunwald wrote in the email released by Wikileaks. Grunwald said that in conversations with Clinton, the former secretary of state had indicated she was ""leaning toward endorsing Glass Steagall,"" instead of or in addition to the risk-based approach she ultimately announced.""I understand we face phoniness charges if we 'change' our position now - but we face risks this way too,"" Grunwald wrote, adding that Clinton's policy team told her it should be a political decision.
In the weeks after the email, Clinton announced that she would look to break up large banks based on the risk they posed to the economy, not based on size alone or type of investment activity. Clinton also proposed levying a ""risk fee"" on the liabilities of banks with more than $50 billion in assets, saying it was a more comprehensive approach.Democratic Party sources told Reuters on Monday they believe that around 50,000 of Podesta's emails are in the possession of Wikileaks and they expect them to be dribbled out periodically between now and the Nov. 8 election between Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.A previous dump of hacked emails from Podesta on Friday included what appear to be excerpts from paid speeches that Clinton made to Wall Street, which her campaign had refused to release.

We are going to devote every ounce of effort and resource into helping the Trump-Pence ticket win and all the other candidates up and down the ballot.""Any attempt to replace Trump on the ballot this close to Election Day would face huge legal and logistical hurdles.A defiant Trump went on the offensive in a vicious presidential debate on Sunday, saying Clinton, a former secretary of state would go to jail if he were president and attacking her husband, former President Bill Clinton, for his treatment of women.The debate, the second of three before the vote, was remarkable for the brutal nature of the exchanges between the two.Trump stayed on the attack on Monday, describing Bill Clinton as ""a predator"" and saying: ""If they want to release more tapes saying inappropriate things, we'll continue to talk about Bill and Hillary Clinton doing inappropriate things. There are so many of them.""
""She goes out and says: 'I love women, I'm going to help women.' She's a total hypocrite,"" he told supporters in Ambridge, Pennsylvania.Clinton accused Trump of brushing off criticism of his comments about women. ""On Friday, the whole world heard him talking about the terrible way he treats women. And last night when he was pressed about how he behaves, he just doubled down on his excuse that it's just locker room banter,"" she told a rally at Wayne State University in Detroit. The television audience for the debate fell sharply from their first, record-breaking encounter in September.    Nielsen data supplied by CNN for 10 broadcast and cable channels on Monday showed that 63.6 million Americans tuned into the 90-minute debate on Sunday, well below the record 84 million that watched the first face-off.    An NBC News/Wall Street Journal opinion poll released on Monday showed Clinton increasing her lead. The survey, conducted after the video release but before the debate, showed Clinton with 46 percent support among likely voters in a four-way matchup including two minor party candidates, compared with 35 percent for Trump.    The Reuters/Ipsos State of the Nation project released on Monday estimated that Clinton had at least a 95 percent chance of winning the 270 Electoral College votes needed to become president. The polling did not capture reaction to Trump's performance in Sunday's debate or the release of the Friday videotape.
