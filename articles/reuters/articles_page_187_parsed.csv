By Jonathan Allen
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK The computer technician who set up Hillary Clinton's private email server for her work as U.S. secretary of state declined to answer questions more than 125 times during a deposition ordered by a federal judge, a transcript released on Thursday shows.Bryan Pagliano worked on Clinton's previous presidential run in 2008. He joined the State Department's technology department the next year as one of Clinton's political appointees and set up the unauthorized server in her New York home. The decision to set up the server has dogged Clinton, the presumptive Democratic Party candidate ahead of November's presidential election, and clouded her campaign with legal uncertainty. A majority of voters say they find her dishonest, polls show, with many citing her private server as a reason.Judge Emmet Sullivan of the U.S. District Court in Washington had ordered Pagliano and other Clinton aides and department officials to give sworn testimony to help him decide whether the server was set up to thwart the public's right to see government records. 
Sullivan is overseeing a lawsuit by Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group suing the State Department. It is one of scores of such lawsuits filed by individuals and groups who were incorrectly told by the government that Clinton had no emails before the arrangement became publicly known in 2015, two years after Clinton left the department.""On the advice of counsel, I will decline to answer your question in reliance on my rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution,"" Pagliano said 128 times over 80 minutes in response to a series of questions by a Judicial Watch lawyer. The deposition under oath took place on Wednesday.The Fifth Amendment gives Americans the right not to be forced to be witnesses against themselves in criminal cases. Pagliano is cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice's criminal inquiry on the server arrangement in exchange for a form of immunity from prosecution. 
The inquiry, prompted by the discovery of classified government secrets among Clinton's emails, has been underway for nearly a year. Investigators have interviewed several of Clinton's senior aides.No one has been charged. 
Clinton has repeatedly said the server was a mistake in hindsight and that she thought it was allowed, which department officials now say was not the case. She has said she does not believe she will be charged with breaking any laws.Her spokesmen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

2	2	http://reuters.com/article/us-health-zika-qanda-factbox-idUSKCN0Z92GN	Factbox: Why the Zika virus is causing alarm	"

Global health officials are racing to better understand the Zika virus behind a major outbreak that began in Brazil last year and has spread to many countries in the Americas. The following are some questions and answers about the virus and current outbreak:How do people become infected?Zika is transmitted to people through the bite of infected female mosquitoes, primarily the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the same type that spreads dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said Aedes mosquitoes are found in all countries in the Americas except Canada and continental Chile, and the virus will likely reach all countries and territories of the region where Aedes mosquitoes are found.How do you treat Zika?There is no treatment or vaccine for Zika infection. Companies and scientists are racing to develop a safe and effective vaccine for Zika, but the World Health Organization (WHO) had said it would take at least 18 months to start large-scale clinical trials of potential preventative shots.How dangerous is it?The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that infection with the Zika virus in pregnant women is a cause of the birth defect microcephaly and other severe brain abnormalities in babies. The CDC said now that the causal relationship has been established, several important questions must still be answered with studies that could take years.According to the World Health Organization, there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can cause the birth defect microcephaly in babies, a condition defined by unusually small heads that can result in developmental problems. In addition, the agency said it could cause Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis. Conclusive proof of the damage caused by Zika may take months or years.Brazil reports the number of confirmed cases of microcephaly at 1,434 through May 21 as doctors and Brazilian health officials find that some suspected cases of microcephaly are not the disorder. Suspected ones under investigation declined to 3,257.Colombia confirmed two cases of microcephaly linked to Zika.Brazil registered 91,387 likely cases of the Zika virus from February until April 2.
Current research in Brazil indicates the greatest microcephaly risk is associated with infection during the first trimester of pregnancy, but health officials have warned an impact could be seen in later weeks. Recent studies have shown evidence of Zika in amniotic fluid, placenta and fetal brain tissue.What are the symptoms of Zika infection?    People infected with Zika may have a mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain and fatigue that can last for two to seven days. But as many as 80 percent of people infected never develop symptoms. The symptoms are similar to those of dengue or chikungunya, which are transmitted by the same type of mosquito.How can Zika be contained?Efforts to control the spread of the virus focus on eliminating mosquito breeding sites and taking precautions against mosquito bites such as using insect repellent and mosquito nets. U.S. and international health officials have advised pregnant women to avoid travel to Latin American and Caribbean countries where they may be exposed to Zika. Cases of sexual transmission have also been reported, prompting health officials to advise use of condoms, or abstaining from sex, to prevent infection between partners.
How widespread is the outbreak?Active Zika outbreaks have been reported in at least 48 countries or territories, most of them in the Americas, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Brazil has been the country most affected. (1.usa.gov/1ovAJyh)Africa (1): Cape Verde Americas (39): Argentina, Aruba, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Bonaire, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Curacao, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Saint Barthelmy, Saint Lucia, Saint Martin, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Maarten, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, U.S. Virgin Islands and VenezuelaOceania/Pacific Islands (8): American Samoa, Fiji, Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Tonga. 
What is the history of the Zika virus?The Zika virus is found in tropical locales with large mosquito populations. Outbreaks of Zika have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Southern Asia and the Western Pacific. The virus was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys and was first identified in people in 1952 in Uganda and Tanzania, according to the WHO. Can Zika be transmitted through sexual contact?The World Health Organization (WHO) said sexual transmission is ""relatively common"" and has advised pregnant women not to travel to areas with ongoing outbreaks of Zika virus. It also  advised women living in areas where the virus is being transmitted to delay getting pregnant.The U.S. CDC is investigating about a dozen cases of possible sexual transmission. All cases involve possible transmission of the virus from men to their sex partners. The WHO has also identified Zika cases in Argentina, Chile, France, Italy and New Zealand as likely caused by sexual transmission. British health officials reported Zika was found in a man's semen two months after he was infected, suggesting the virus may linger in semen long after infection symptoms fade.The PAHO said Zika can be transmitted through blood, but this is an infrequent transmission mechanism. There is no evidence Zika can be transmitted to babies through breast milk.What other complications are associated with Zika?Zika has also been associated with other neurological disorders, including serious brain and spinal cord infections. The long-term health consequences of Zika infection are unclear. Other uncertainties surround the incubation period of the virus and how Zika interacts with other viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes, such as dengue.

By Ginger Gibson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican Donald Trump has forgiven nearly $50 million in loans he made to his presidential campaign, he said on Thursday, signaling to donors that future contributions will be used to fight Democrat Hillary Clinton and not to repay himself.The announcement that Trump will not seek repayment of the loans via contributions came amid concerns from his backers that he does not have enough money to fund his campaign for the Nov. 8 election. He had only $1.3 million in cash to start the month.""I have absolutely no intention of paying myself back for the nearly $50 million dollars I have loaned to the campaign,"" the presumptive Republican nominee said in a statement.The New York developer has suggested he could use more of his personal wealth to help win the White House.""(Trump) has also said he will contribute significantly more money,"" Steve Mnuchin, the top fundraiser for Trump's campaign, said in an interview on CNBC earlier on Thursday. Mnuchin was the first to say that Trump would forgive the loans.Although Trump has said he has ""unlimited"" personal wealth to fund his White House run, a Reuters review of his financial disclosures suggests he does not have enough cash to see his campaign through to Election Day.Gaylord Hughey, a Texas-based fundraiser supporting Trump, called Trump's decision to forgive the loans ""unprecedented.""""I think it indicates that he's all in and he wants every dollar to be spent toward a successful campaign for the general election,"" Hughey said.Hughey, who as a bundler collects donations from other supporters, said Trump was broadening the pool of donors in addition to gaining support from people who historically donate to Republicans. 
""We've had new folks come in as major donors unexpectedly,"" Hughey said.Mnuchin also told CNBC that Trump had seen a strong uptick in fundraising in the past week.He said Trump raised about $10 million in conjunction with the Republican Party at fundraising events this week. Trump also raised $6 million through online donations, Mnuchin said, following the wealthy New York businessman's first attempt to appeal to supporters to contribute to his campaign.""We've really ramped up the effort this month,"" Mnuchin said. Supporters began worrying on Monday after Trump's campaign revealed weak fundraising totals. He began June far behind Clinton, who had a $42 million war chest to start the month.
Candidates need a hefty bank account to fund a presidential bid, including hundreds of millions of dollars for television advertising and staff. Trump has benefited from extensive media coverage but could be buried in attack ads if he lacks the funds to push his own message.Mnuchin said Trump's numbers at the beginning of June were ""irrelevant"" because his fundraising efforts for the general election only started recently. JOINT FUNDRAISING ACCOUNT

Trump funded his campaign for the Republican nomination largely through his own personal wealth, putting money into his campaign in the form of loans. By leaving them as loans, he would be entitled to seek repayment from his campaign.By converting the loans into contributions, Trump is telling his supporters he will not seek repayment via contributions. There are no legal limits on how much candidates can contribute to their own campaigns, in contrast to caps on how much an individual, company or group can give.Trump only began fundraising in earnest at the end of May. His campaign has said that donations have been ""pouring in"" since he started seeking contributions. On Tuesday, Trump attended a dinner fundraiser in Manhattan, where the attendees included billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, Anthony Scaramucci of SkyBridge Capital and hedge fund manager John Paulson. Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets football team, hosted a breakfast fundraiser for Trump at a restaurant in the city.Trump's campaign was working to quickly raise large sums via a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee and several state Republican parties. A presidential candidate can only accept up to $5,400 from an individual donor. The joint fundraising agreement allows Trump to accept checks as high as $450,000. The donations are then divided up between the campaign and the state funds. That money is then used to hire staff and contact voters in battleground states, efforts intended to help elect Trump and other Republicans running for office. Such states are hotly contested because their voters can swing either to Republicans or Democrats and play a decisive role in White House contests.

WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate on Thursday advanced a compromise gun control plan to stop people on some terrorism watch lists from buying guns, in the wake of the June 12th mass shooting in Orlando, Florida.While the measure, spearheaded by Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, cleared one procedural hurdle, it was not clear if the Senate would move further ahead on it. Passing the bill in the House of Representatives could also be an uphill battle.

By Richard Cowan and Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Another attempt at gun control faltered in the U.S. Congress on Thursday despite outrage at the Orlando massacre, as a proposed ban on firearms sales to people being monitored for links to terrorism barely avoided being killed in the Senate.In a procedural vote, the Senate narrowly rejected an attempt to scrap the plan by Republican Senator Susan Collins to prevent guns getting into the hands of people on two U.S. government terrorism watch lists. But the proposal looked short of the support it would need to advance through the chamber, and Republican leaders said the Senate would switch from debating gun control to other matters until at least after the July 4 holiday.        It was the latest setback for proponents of gun restrictions who have been thwarted for years on Capitol Hill by gun rights defenders and the National Rifle Association.    Frequent efforts at gun control have failed despite anger at mass shootings like the killings at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 and in San Bernardino, California, last year. ""Eventually this problem will get addressed again one of two ways: We find a breakthrough, which I will seek, or there will be another terrorist attack which will bring us right back to this issue. I hope we can do it without another terrorist attack,"" said Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican who supported Collins.       A few hours earlier, Democratic lawmakers ended a sit-in protest in the House of Representatives over guns.Fueled by Chinese food and pizzas, dozens of them stayed on the House floor all night, at times bursting into the civil rights anthem ""We Shall Overcome"" before giving up their protest after 25 hours.        ""It's not a struggle that lasts for one day, or one week, or one month, or one year,"" said Representative John Lewis, a Democrat from Georgia and a key figure in the civil rights protests of the 1960s. ""We're going to win the struggle,"" said Lewis, who led the House sit-in.
    Dramatic protests by legislators are rare in the U.S. Capitol and the sit-in underscored how sensitive the gun control issue became after this month's Florida attack, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.Opinion polls show Americans are increasingly in favor of more restrictions on guns in a country with more than 310 million weapons, about one for every citizen.     ORLANDO ATTACK

After a gunman pledging allegiance to Islamic State fatally shot 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, some senators had seen resistance to gun restrictions softening because the issue had partly become one of national security.But Collins' measure received only 52 votes in the 100-seat Senate test vote, short of the 60 votes that would be needed for  approval in future Senate procedural votes. While her plan could be revived next month, it is unclear if she has the momentum to overcome pro-gun rights forces in Congress who argue that gun control measures in Congress have been too restrictive and trample on the constitutional right to bear arms. Four other gun control measures failed earlier this week.             Collins, a Maine lawmaker, wants to forbid gun sales to anyone on the U.S. government's ""No Fly List"" for terrorism suspects or the ""Selectee List"" of people who receive extra security screening at airports.        Despite the lack of legislation, the gun debate has stirred passions. The House Democrats' sit-in brought an outpouring of grass-roots activity. 
Jennifer Hoppe, deputy director of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said that in less than 24 hours from Wednesday, about 130,000 calls were made from supporters of gun control to members of Congress.First lady Michelle Obama backed the House Democrats' protest.""We have grieved for too many children and wept for too many families after shootings. Chicago. Tucson. Newtown. Charleston. Orlando. #Enough,"" she wrote on Twitter on Thursday.The Democrats were seeking votes on legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases, as well as measures to curb the sale of weapons to people on government watch lists            Republicans allied with the NRA gun rights group say that while they want to combat terrorism, they represent constituents who believe firmly in the constitutional right to bear arms. ""It's a tough issue. For people like myself, who come from a hunting and fishing state, it's pretty hard,"" said Senator Orrin Hatch, a conservative Utah Republican who voted against Collins.

By Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday agreed to $1.1 billion to fight the Zika virus, short-changing President Barack Obama's $1.9 billion funding request and angering Democrats by making other cuts to pay for it.The House approved a funding deal that had been agreed to on Wednesday by Republicans from both the House and Senate. But the bill's future was uncertain in the Senate, where the Democratic minority has more power to stop legislation, and Democratic leader Harry Reid has declared his opposition.""It is a responsible plan that assures the administration will continue to have the needed resources to protect the public,"" Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said. Republicans said the deal included funding for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. But the White House said the allocation fell short. ""This plan from congressional Republicans is four months late and nearly a billion dollars short of what our public health experts have said is necessary to do everything possible to fight the Zika virus, and steals funding from other health priorities,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement before the House voted.
Earnest said the Republican plan would limit needed birth control services for women seeking to prevent Zika, which can be spread through unprotected sex -- ""a clear indication they don't take seriously the threat from the Zika virus."" Democrats have been urging Republicans for months to agree to more Zika funding, and the Obama administration has already reprogrammed nearly $600 million that had been set aside to fight Ebola.
House Democrats said they could not go along with the deal because of $750 million in budget cuts elsewhere that the Republicans want to use to pay for the Zika spending. Senate Democrats also voiced displeasure, clouding the outlook for it passing.""A narrowly partisan proposal that cuts off women's access to birth control, shortchanges veterans and rescinds Obamacare funds to cover the cost is not a serious response to the threat from the Zika virus,"" Reid said. 
Still, Ryan urged the Senate to move on the bill. According to House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, $543 million of the $1.1 billion would come from unspent funds set aside for implementing Obamacare in U.S. territories, while $107 million would come from unused funds to fight another virus, Ebola. Another $100 million would come from unused administrative funds at the Department of Health and Human Services, he said.
