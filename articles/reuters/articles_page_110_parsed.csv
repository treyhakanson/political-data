WASHINGTON A sheriff's department in North Dakota is investigating possible charges against the U.S. Green Party presidential candidate, Jill Stein, for damaging equipment during protests on Tuesday over construction of an oil pipeline.Stein was part of a group protesting the Dakota Access pipeline and spray-painted construction equipment, the Morton County Sheriff's Department said. Stein does not dispute the account.Protesters, who say the project will damage burial sites considered sacred to a nearby Native American tribe and pollute the area's drinking water, also attached themselves to bulldozers and broke a fence, the department said.Stein, a 66-year-old doctor and environmental activist from Massachusetts, said in a statement that she had spray-painted the words ""I approve this message"" onto a bulldozer, a nod to the phrase American politicians append to their advertisements to comply with transparency laws. No arrests were made, the department said, and the investigation was continuing. The department also posted a picture on its Facebook page that showed Stein spraying the bulldozer, calling it a ""criminal act.""    
The $3.7 billion, 1,100-mile (1,800-km) pipeline project would be the first to move crude oil from the Bakken shale, a vast oil formation in North Dakota, to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Energy Transfer Partners is leading a group of firms to build it. The project sparked violent clashes during the weekend between tribe members and other protesters and security officers near the construction site, and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is seeking a court order to block construction.The Green Party opposes continued investment in oil extraction because of its link to climate change.
""I hope the North Dakota authorities press charges against the real vandalism taking place at the Standing Rock Sioux reservation: the bulldozing of sacred burial sites and the unleashing of vicious attack dogs,"" Stein said in her statement. She said that pipeline security officials had used dogs and pepper spray on protesters over the weekend. A spokeswoman for Energy Transfer Partners did not respond to a request for comment.
A Reuters-Ipsos poll in late August showed Stein the first choice of 2 percent of voters, trailing Democrat Hillary Clinton, Republican Donald Trump and Libertarian Gary Johnson. The U.S. presidential election will be held on Nov. 8.Stein was arrested for trespassing in Texas during her 2012 presidential campaign when she tried to take supplies to protesters opposed to the Keystone XL pipeline.

WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate's permanent subcommittee on investigations will probe Mylan Pharmaceuticals' pricing of the allergy auto-injector EpiPen, according to a press release issued on Wednesday.The release described the probe as a ""preliminary inquiry.""Mylan has been criticized - including by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton - for sharply raising the price of EpiPens, which are carried by people with life-threatening allergies. Mylan raised the price from about $100 in 2008 to about $600 currently. It has offered some discounts but this has done little to allay concerns.
""Our review of this matter will be robust, thorough, and bipartisan. Parents and school districts in Ohio, Missouri and across the country need affordable access to this life-saving drug, and we share their concern over Mylan's sustained price increases,"" Senators Rob Portman, the Republican chair of the subcommittee, and Claire McCaskill, the top Democrat, said in a statement.
Mylan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

By Yara Bayoumy
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama's administration has offered Saudi Arabia more than $115 billion in weapons, other military equipment and training, the most of any U.S. administration in the 71-year U.S.-Saudi alliance, a report seen by Reuters has found. The report, authored by William Hartung of the U.S.-based Center for International Policy, said the offers were made in 42 separate deals, and the majority of the equipment has yet to be delivered. Hartung told Reuters the report would be made available publicly on Sept. 8. The report said U.S. arms offers to Saudi Arabia since Obama took office in January 2009 have included everything from small arms and ammunition to tanks, attack helicopters, air-to-ground missiles, missile defense ships, and warships. Washington also provides maintenance and training to Saudi security forces.The Center's report is based on data from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, a Department of Defense body that provides figures on arms sales offers and Foreign Military Sales agreements. Most of the offers, which are reported to Congress, become formal agreements though some are abandoned or amended. The report did not disclose how many of the offers to Saudi Arabia were agreed. Washington's arms sales to Riyadh recently have come under fire from rights groups and some members of Congress are disturbed by the rising number of civilian casualties in the war in Yemen, where a coalition led by Saudi Arabia is fighting Iran-allied Houthi rebels.The conflict has killed at least 10,000 people.  Last month the United Nations human rights office said that 3,799 civilians have died in the conflict, with coalition air strikes responsible for an estimated 60 percent of the deaths.
The coalition says it does not target civilians and accuses the Houthis of placing military targets in civilian areas. The coalition has created a body to investigate civilian casualties.The outcry over those casualties has led some members of Congress to push for restrictions on arms transfers, and amid the growing outcry, the Pentagon cautioned that its support for Saudi Arabia in its Yemen campaign was not ""a blank check"".The Control Arms coalition, a group that campaigns for stricter arms sales controls, said last month that Britain, France and the United States were flouting the 2014 Arms Trade treaty, which bans exports of conventional weapons that fuel human rights violations or war crimes.
Nevertheless, the Obama administration last month approved a potential $1.15 billion arms package for Saudi Arabia.Hartung said the level of U.S. arms sales to Riyadh should give it leverage to pressure Saudi Arabia.""It's time for the Obama administration to use the best leverage it has - Saudi Arabia's dependence on U.S. weapons and support - to wage the war in Yemen in the first place,"" Hartung told Reuters.
""Pulling back the current offer of battle tanks or freezing some of the tens of billions in weapons and services in the pipeline would send a strong signal to the Saudi leadership that they need stop their indiscriminate bombing campaign and take real steps to prevent civilian casualties.""Washington has been at pains to prove to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies that it remains committed to their defense against Iran in the wake of a multinational deal last year to restrict the Iranian nuclear program. Sunni Muslim Gulf states accuse Shi'ite Iran of fomenting instability in the region, which the Islamic Republic denies.""The more recent deals that have involved resupplying Saudi Arabia with ammunition, bombs, and tanks to replace weaponry used up or damaged in the war in Yemen are no doubt driven in part by the effort to 'reassure' the Saudis that the U.S. will not tilt towards Iran in the wake of the nuclear deal,"" Hartung said.

A graffiti artist lampooned Maine Governor Paul LePage in a mural depicting the two-term Republican wearing a Ku Klux Klan cape and hood, two weeks after he left a profane voicemail for a Democratic lawmaker he believed had called him a racist.The mural, which appeared over the weekend in Portland on a wall where graffiti is allowed by law, has been repainted to remove the reference to the white supremacist group, with the hood replaced with Mickey Mouse ears and a new caption ""no hate"" joining the existing ""racist homophobe moron governor,"" in which the word ""governor"" was struck through.Lawmakers from both parties last week contemplated calling a special session to rebuke LePage, whose term extends through 2018, for the message, in which he called a lawmaker a ""little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker.""That effort collapsed with the two sides unable to agree on the details of how long the special session would last or what its precise objectives were, with Democrats calling for impeachment, further than Republicans were willing to go.""I think it was a lot of work but I think a lot of people are pretty upset about how things are going,"" Falmouth resident Emily Hickey told Maine CBS affiliate WGME as she viewed the mural.
Tom Poulin, of Oakland, Maine, said he believed the painting was in poor taste.""You can have your personal thoughts about somebody but to say them like that is a little ridiculous,"" he told WGME.
Portland Mayor Ethan Strimling, a Democrat, said on Twitter that he had asked city officials to take down the mural.""As much as we are all infuriated by the governor's statements, equating his language to the systemic terrorism and murder Grand Wizards inflicted upon African Americans (and Catholics) trivializes the KKK,"" Strimling said.
A spokeswoman for LePage did not immediately respond to a request for comment.LePage has faced a flurry of criticism over the past two weeks for saying that members of minority groups from out of state were responsible for the lion's share of the heroin trade in Maine. He drew further criticism after the widely circulated voicemail. (Reporting by WGME via Reuters Video News; Writing by Scott Malone; Editing by James Dalgleish)"	['Paul', 'LePage']	[]

WASHINGTON Republican Donald Trump raised about $90 million in August in his campaign for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election against Democrat Hillary Clinton, his campaign said on Wednesday.The fundraising totals, first reported by Fox News, did not include a breakdown of how much of the total the New York real estate mogul contributed to his own campaign. Trump said at a rally on Tuesday that he himself contributed a lot of the money to his campaign in August.MORE POLITICS HEADLINES:

In July, Trump took in $80 million.Trump, a former reality TV star who has never held elected office, has already defied precedent in campaign spending. During the primary, he was outspent by many of his Republican rivals but was able to leverage free media coverage to secure the party's presidential nomination.
But Republican supporters have warned that he may not be able to replicate the winning formula in the general election, when turning out less-engaged voters is a key piece of victory.Trump did not begin fundraising with intensity until June.Clinton began August with $58 million, compared to Trump who started the month with $38 million.

By Jonathan Stempel and Joseph Ax
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK A federal appeals court on Wednesday rejected an effort by news media to force prosecutors in the George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal known as ""Bridgegate"" to disclose the names of unindicted co-conspirators.Reversing a lower court ruling, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia found no right of public access under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment or the common law to a list of people implicated but not criminally charged.The 3-0 decision came one day before jury selection was scheduled to begin in the trial of two former allies of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie who are accused of arranging the September 2013 shutdown of bridge access lanes in Fort Lee, New Jersey, causing several days of gridlock.""Public access to judicial documents and court proceedings is a respected tradition and important legal principle, but it has bounds,"" Circuit Judge Kent Jordan wrote.While it may make sense to release the names at trial, ""that time is not here yet,"" he added.
Prosecutors accused William Baroni, a former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Bridget Anne Kelly, a former Christie deputy chief of staff, of closing lanes to punish Fort Lee's Democratic mayor, Mark Sokolich, for not endorsing the successful re-election of Christie, a Republican.Disclosing the list could have shown whether other Christie allies sought political payback by snarling traffic.Another former Port Authority official, David Wildstein, is cooperating with prosecutors after pleading guilty.
Christie has denied involvement, but the scandal helped erode his once-high approval ratings. He ran unsuccessfully this year for the White House. His office had no immediate comment.U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton in Newark had in May ordered disclosing the names of unindicted co-conspirators, but a ""John Doe"" on the list appealed, fearing reputational harm.Bruce Rosen, a lawyer for media companies including ABC, the Associated Press and the New York Times, in an email said his clients are disappointed, and no decision on an appeal has been made.
Doe's lawyer, Jenny Kramer, in an email said she was gratified that the appeals court ""prevented disclosure of highly prejudicial material.""A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman in New Jersey, who supported Doe, declined to comment.Baroni and Kelly have pleaded not guilty to wire fraud, civil rights deprivation and conspiracy charges, and received the list of names to help prepare for trial. Their lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. (Reporting by Joseph Ax and Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Matthew Lewis)"	['Paul', 'Jordan', 'Christie']	[]

WASHINGTON Two leading critics of President Barack Obama's moves toward normal relations with Cuba introduced legislation on Wednesday seeking to temporarily halt commercial flights between the United States and the island because of security concerns.Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, both Cuban-American opponents of Obama's Cuba policy, introduced the Cuban Airport Security Act. The measure would stop commercial flights until after a study of security measures and equipment at airports in Cuba.The U.S. government has granted several U.S. airlines permission to begin scheduled flights to Cuba, opening another chapter in the Obama administration's efforts to improve ties and increase trade and travel with the former Cold War foe.A JetBlue Airways Corp passenger jet flew to Santa Clara, Cuba, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Aug. 31. It was the first scheduled commercial passenger flight from the United States to Cuba in more than half a century.
Commercial flights to the capital, Havana, are expected to begin later this year.Obama's Cuba policy sharply divides the U.S. Congress.  Opponents, mostly Republicans but also a few Democrats, say he is moving too quickly to ease restrictions on travel and trade, given continuing human rights violations by its Communist government.
Backers say it is time to try another tactic in dealing with Havana after more than half a century with no change under the previous policy.
A version of the bill was introduced in the House of Representatives in July. There has been no announcement of when the measure might come up for a vote. (Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Bill Trott)"	['Rubio', 'Obama']	[]

By Arshad Mohammed and Jeff Mason

 (Note: Paragraphs 1 and 9 contain strong language that might offend some readers)By Arshad Mohammed and Jeff MasonWASHINGTON/TAMPA The U.S. State Department and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Tuesday stressed the need for ties with the Philippines to be based on mutual respect, after Manila's new leader raised worries about the future of the key alliance by calling President Barack Obama a ""son of a bitch.""Despite U.S. dismay over Duterte's remarks, current and former U.S. officials played down the impact, saying they did not expect any serious damage to ties at a time of high tensions over China's extensive territorial claims in Asia.The State Department said a planned first meeting between Obama and his counterpart Rodrigo Duterte on the sidelines of a regional summit in Laos on Tuesday was canceled because the tone of the Philippine leader's rhetoric raised questions about the chances of productive talks.""Words matter, and we want to see an atmosphere that is cordial and open to strong cooperation,"" State Department spokesman Mark Toner told a regular news briefing in Washington.Clinton, who as secretary of state was an architect of Obama's policy of emphasizing the importance of the Asia Pacific to U.S. interests in the face of a rising China, said Obama was right to cancel the meeting.""When the president of the Philippines insulted our president, it was appropriate in a very low-key way to say: sorry, no meeting,"" she told reporters on her campaign plane.""We have a lot of ties between the United States and the Philippines. And I think it's very important that we have a relationship, but there has to be a certain level of respect that is expected on both sides,"" Clinton said.Duterte made the remark about Obama while explaining that he would not be lectured over extrajudicial killings in the war against drugs he has launched since taking over two months ago and which has killed about 2,400 people.
He has previously called the pope a ""son of a whore"" and the U.S. ambassador a ""gay son of whore.""The Philippines voiced regret for Duterte's comments after Obama canceled a formal bilateral meeting. The White House then said Obama might speak with Duterte informally.""FEELING HIS WAY""
Duterte's volatile nature threatens to complicate Washington's ties with its closest ally in Southeast Asia as it tries to forge a united front in the region in response to China's extensive claims in the strategic South China Sea.
The Philippines has been central in this effort due to an international court case it brought and won against Beijing. In March, the United States and the Philippines agreed on five locations for U.S. military facilities in the country under a new security deal. The deal grants Washington increased military presence in its former colony through rotation of ships and planes for humanitarian and maritime security operations. Asked about Duterte's comments, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said the defense relationship with the Philippines was a ""strong"" and ""longstanding"" one.Speaking to reporters, Carter also described the Philippines' new defense minister, Delfin Lorenzana, as someone who was ""very knowledgeable about all the things that we do together.""An official of the U.S. State Department said ""government to government"" relations with Manila remained strong.
""The areas that we believe we have robust, strong cooperation with them, we are not going to just simply throw that aside.""The official noted that Duterte was new to national leadership having served as a city mayor.""He is maybe feeling his way into the new job,"" the official said.Former U.S. officials said China would be pleased by the U.S.-Philippines friction.    ""Time will tell whether President Duterte steps back from this episode and realizes he needs to recalibrate his choice of words in engaging U.S. leaders,"" said Amy Searight, a former senior Pentagon official now at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.Evan Medeiros, Obama's former top Asia adviser and now a senior analyst at the Eurasia Group, saw the row as a ""speed bump, not a road block"" in U.S.-Philippines ties.    ""It's unfortunate, but doesn't fundamentally derail the relationship,"" he said.
