WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, the Washington Post reported on Monday, citing three people close to Trump.The meeting in New York comes after weeks of telephone conversations between Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, and Kissinger, who was a top adviser to Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, the Post said.Last week, Trump met with former Secretary of State James Baker, who told a congressional hearing on the same day as the meeting that Trump's foreign policy proposals would make the world a less stable place.
Trump has been criticized for suggesting the United States should rethink the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and that Japan and South Korea should consider getting nuclear weapons to defend themselves.

BOSTON Two Boston brothers accused of urinating on and beating a homeless Mexican man and telling police ""Donald Trump was right: All these illegals need to be deported,"" were sentenced to prison on Monday, prosecutors said.Scott Leader, 38, and Steve Leader, 30, had previously pleaded guilty to indictments charging them with causing bodily injury while committing a civil rights violation, as well as assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, among other charges.Scott Leader was sentenced to three years in prison and Steve Leader was sentenced to 1-1/2 years, the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office said in a statement. The pair will also be on probation for three years after their prison sentences end.The Leaders were arrested on Aug. 19 on suspicion of beating Rodriguez, then 58, as he slept in a subway station. The men told police they targeted their victim because they believed he was an illegal immigrant. The victim, Guillermo Rodriguez, said in a statement that he was in fact a permanent resident.
""I came to this country many years ago and worked hard in the farm fields to provide produce to people here. I actually became a permanent resident of this country years ago, although if I had been undocumented I still would not have deserved to be beaten this way,"" Rodriguez said in a prepared statement read by Assistant District Attorney Nicole Rimar before the sentencing.The pair punched and kicked Rodriguez, and one of the men repeatedly struck him with a metal pole, before the two walked off laughing, prosecutors said.According to a police report, they told officers, ""Donald Trump was right: All these illegals need to be deported.""
Prosecutors said Scott Leader told arresting officers that he believed the attack was justified because the victim was homeless and Hispanic. The pair also allegedly threatened police officers while in custody.Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the U.S. presidential race, has been vocal on immigration, proposing to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and promising, if elected, to deport the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants already in the United States.
Trump, a real estate developer and reality television personality, initially described the attack as an outcome of passionate views on immigration but later called it ""terrible.""Lawyers for the two men could not be reached for immediate comment on Monday night.

WASHINGTON A woman at the center of a New York Times piece detailing Republican Donald Trump's history with women took issue with the story on Monday, saying she never had a negative experience with the billionaire and does not believe he ever mistreated women.Rowanne Brewer Lane, a former model who dated Trump for several months starting in the late 1990s, said her words were mischaracterized in the Times article, which used dozens of interviews to show what it said was a pattern of unsettling personal behavior by the presidential candidate with women.The Times story said Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election, asked Lane to change into a bikini shortly after meeting her at a pool party at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. According to the article, he then introduced her to the crowd outside, saying, ""That is a stunning Trump girl, isn't it?""On Monday, Lane told the same story in a series of television interviews but said she had been flattered by his comment.""They spun it to where it appeared negative,"" Lane said on Fox News. ""I did not have a negative experience with Donald Trump.""Lane said that during the time she and Trump were dating, he ""never made me feel like I was being demeaned in any way.""
She also said she supports Trump's presidential run.The New York Times responded to Lane's accusations by saying she was quoted ""fairly, accurately and at length.""
""The story provides context for the reader including that the swimsuit scene was the 'start of a whirlwind romance' between Ms. Brewer Lane and Mr. Trump,"" Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha said in a statement.Trump has deflected criticism about his attitude toward women throughout his campaign. On Monday, he called the New York Times ""so dishonest.""""Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer, who said it was a lie!"" Trump posted on Twitter.    
Times reporters Michael Barbaro and Megan Twohey defended their story in several television interviews on Monday, saying it showed how Trump behaved privately with women and revealed common themes including unwelcome advances, aggression and commentary on their appearance.""People can evaluate the story ... on its own merits,"" Barbaro said on CBS ""This Morning.""

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama's White House set up one last fight with the Republican-controlled Congress over defense spending on Monday, threatening to veto a 2017 defense authorization bill over its use of special war funds for day-to-day military programs.The House of Representatives draft of the $602 billion National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, which sets spending policy for the Department of Defense, would shift $18 billion of wartime Overseas Contingency Operations, or OCO, funds to avoid automatic budget cuts to military programs.The Obama administration objects to the use of that money, saying it threatens U.S. security and unfairly spares the Pentagon from cuts faced by important civilian programs such as medical research and education.""By gambling with warfighting funds, the bill risks the safety of our men and women fighting to keep America safe, undercuts stable planning and efficient use of taxpayer dollars, dispirits troops and their families, baffles our allies, and emboldens our enemies,"" the White House said in a statement.
House Republicans say the spending plan is essential to ensure that the military has the resources it needs, as it wages wars in Afghanistan and against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.The Obama administration also objected to a long list of policy provisions in the bill, including measures making it more difficult to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and cuts in funding for programs to train and equip local fighters in Iraq and Syria.Obama vetoed one version of the 2016 NDAA over its use of OCO funding and the Guantanamo restrictions. He later signed a modified version that addressed his budget concerns but left the Guantanamo measures in place.
It will be months before the legislation passes Congress and arrives on Obama's desk.The House draft has passed the House Armed Services Committee, and Republican leaders would like a vote by the full House as soon as Wednesday.
However, lawmakers have offered 375 amendments on a huge range of issues. The Rules Committee was meeting late on Monday to decide which of those amendments might come up for a vote.The Senate is also drafting its version of the NDAA, which must be reconciled with the House's before being subject to vote in both chambers. If passed, that version would be sent to the White House for Obama's signature, or veto. (Additional reporting by Eric Walsh; Editing by Eric Beech and Leslie Adler)"

HAVANA Cuba and the United States aim to reach new agreements on cooperation in law enforcement, health and agriculture over the coming months, a senior Cuban official said on Monday, as part of the former Cold War foes' drive to normalize ties.The Communist-ruled island and its northern neighbor reestablished diplomatic relations a year ago after decades of hostility and have since signed deals on the environment, postal services and direct flights.A bilateral commission met on Monday in Havana to establish a roadmap for talks over the rest of this year, which would include more high-ranking official visits, said Josefina Vidal, head of the Cuban delegation.In March, Barack Obama became the first sitting U.S. president in 88 years to visit Cuba.""The agenda is quite ambitious,"" Vidal told a news conference, adding that talks about intellectual property rights were also in the cards.
The two sides had discussed holding dialogues on human rights and claims, the U.S. embassy in Cuba said in a statement.They already outlined their respective claims late last year, with the U.S. seeking upwards of $10 billion in compensation for nationalized properties and Cuba demanding at least $121 billion in reparations for the U.S. trade embargo and other acts it described as aggression.
""The United States looks forward to holding these meetings in the near future,"" the embassy said. ""Tomorrow (we) will discuss specific steps related to bilateral security during the law enforcement dialogue.""Vidal, who is the Cuban Foreign Ministry's chief of U.S. affairs, said the island was hopeful that whomever became next the U.S. president would continue to deepen the detente. The United States will hold a general election on Nov.8.
""When you look at the polls, the majority of the American population and the Cuban American community are in favor of the normalization of relations,"" she said. ""So I expect their opinion will be taken into account."" (Reporting by Sarah Marsh; Editing by Toni Reinhold)"

WASHINGTON A congressional committee on Monday put off plans to debate legislation on how to address Puerto Rico's economic crisis, the latest sign of ongoing struggle by lawmakers to find a solution for the American territory's crippling $70 billion debt.For months the Natural Resources Committee of the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has been weighing whether and how to rescue Puerto Rico from a crippling debt without spending any U.S. taxpayer money.A committee spokesman said the panel will unveil a new draft proposal soon and then consider that plan in a work session next week.House Speaker Paul Ryan has rejected any bailout of creditors and instead has been mulling the creation of an oversight board that would reschedule the U.S. territory's debt payments.
The committee repeatedly has had to hold off on such a work session because of a lack of agreement. Some of the panel's 26 Republicans oppose any debt restructuring, while some of its 18 Democrats want limitations on the oversight board, and object to some side issues included in the bill, such as one having to do with the Caribbean island's minimum wage law.
On May 1, Puerto Rico, which is suffering from a 45 percent poverty rate, defaulted on some of its debt when it missed paying the Government Development Bank around $400 million. It faces another debt payment, of nearly $2 billion, on July 1.The Republican-led U.S. Senate has been awaiting action by the House before debating a Puerto Rico debt bill.

By Daniel Wiessner

A federal agency on Monday released final rules on how employers can offer workers financial incentives of up to 30 percent of the cost of their cheapest health insurance plans to participate in wellness programs without violating federal laws protecting the confidentiality of medical information.The move from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission aims to clear up confusion over the way two federal laws protecting employees' medical privacy apply to the popular programs, which are designed to control medical spending by reducing obesity, smoking and other risk factors. The rules, which were first proposed in November, mark a compromise with U.S. businesses that opposed the EEOC's previous stance that providing incentives for voluntary wellness programs rendered them involuntary, and thus illegal.The 2010 Affordable Care Act allowed U.S. employers to increase the rewards they offer to employees who participate in wellness programs. But in a series of 2013 lawsuits against companies, including Honeywell International Inc, the EEOC said requests for medical information related to incentive-based wellness programs violated the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. 
Under the new rules, incentives for wellness programs are open only to employees, not their families, and are capped at 30 percent of the cheapest individual health insurance premium offered through the employer.The new rules are more restrictive than those passed under the ACA, which allowed incentives of up to 30 percent of the actual cost of an employee's insurance plan and 50 percent for programs approved by the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services. Only smoking-cessation programs received that approval.Senator Lamar Alexander (R.-Tennessee), chair of the Senate's Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said he would push legislation, along with House Republicans, to reverse the rules.
The National Business Group on Health, a non-profit organization advocating for large healthcare employers, said that although it would have ""hoped for some additional flexibility... the rules do what the EEOC was asked to do.""Some health and workers' rights groups say the rules, which take effect next year, penalize employees who decline to join wellness programs and hand over private medical information.
Maxwell Mehlman, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, said lower-income employees could be unduly pressured to join wellness programs.""It's hard to say that that's a voluntary program for a lot of people,"" he said.

By Richard Cowan and Timothy Gardner
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives will try to pass legislation this week providing $622.1 million in funds to fight the spreading Zika virus, far less than the Obama administration has been seeking.House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers introduced the measure on Monday, according to a statement. The bill would offset the new spending by taking $352.1 million from an Ebola fund and another $270 million from a Department of Health and Human Services administrative account.The bill ""will make dollars available to fight the disease now, prioritizing critical activities that must begin immediately, such as vaccine development and mosquito control,"" Rogers said.The mosquito-borne Zika virus has been linked to severe birth defects and other neurological disorders and is beginning to show up in warm climates in U.S. southern states such as Florida.The Obama administration in February called for $1.9 billion in emergency funds that would not result in any government spending cuts elsewhere.
The White House and health officials have expressed concerns in the past with taking money from Ebola programs to pay for Zika virus efforts.But in April, after the Republican-led Congress did not act, it found a temporary fix to fund the fight against Zika by redirecting $589 million, mostly from Ebola funds.  White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Monday that congressional inaction on supplemental funding meant that health officials are forced to resort to the equivalent of ""digging through the sofa cushions to try to come up with the necessary money.""
The House bill is also at odds with legislation being debated in the Senate. Competing proposals there would either give Obama the full $1.9 billion or at least $1.1 billion.The Senate is expected to cast initial votes on the alternatives on Tuesday.Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of being ""beyond reckless"" by being slow to send money to combat a ""raging virus.""
If the House and Senate approve competing versions they would have to reconcile their differences and pass one uniform bill before sending it to Obama for signing into law.Of the $622.1 million proposed by House Republicans, $230 million would go to the National Institutes of Health to help support the development of vaccines to stop the spread of Zika. Other funds would be contributed to global health programs, through the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development, and for the development of rapid diagnostic tests.

By Dan Whitcomb
| LOS ANGELES

LOS ANGELES A federal appeals court on Monday revived a lawsuit by prospective gun shop owners who were banned by Alameda County, California, from opening within 500 feet of a residential district, ruling that local officials had failed to justify their law in the face of a constitutional right to bear arms.A three-member panel of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals did not strike down the local ordinance, but voted 2-1 to overturn a federal judge who threw the gun store owners' lawsuit out of court.Gun rights groups quickly hailed the decision as an important protection of the Second Amendment.""We're very happy to see the Court take a very principled and reasoned approach to protecting the fundamental, individual right to keep and bear arms,"" Brandon Combs, executive director of the Calguns Foundation, said in a written statement. The Ninth Circuit panel ordered that judge to take up the case again and said that if Alameda County wanted to enforce the gun-control ordinance, officials there would have to prove that there was a basis for the restrictions.
""Alameda County's ordinance may very well be permissible. Thus far, however, the county has failed to justify the burden it has placed on the right of law-abiding citizens to purchase guns,"" Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain wrote in a 34-page opinion for the majority. ""The Second Amendment (of the U.S. Constitution) requires something more rigorous than the unsubstantiated assertions offered to the district court,"" O'Scannlain wrote.Representatives for the Alameda County Board of Supervisors could not immediately be reached for comment.
In tossing the lawsuit out of court, the lower-court judge found that Alameda County's gun restrictions were permissible to achieve such ""important governmental objectives"" as protecting public safety, preserving the character of residential areas and guarding against ""secondary effects"" of gun stores.But the Ninth Circuit majority said that Alameda County had not provided any evidence that such objectives would be achieved.
The plaintiffs also asserted that no parcels in Alameda County would fit within the regulations, which meant that gun sales were effectively banned there.In dissenting from the majority, Judge Barry Silverman said that the ordinance did not infringe upon anyone's right to bear arms and that ""what we're dealing with here is a mundane zoning dispute dressed up as a Second Amendment challenge.""

By Anjali Athavaley and Charlotte Greenfield
| NEW YORK/WELLINGTON

NEW YORK/WELLINGTON Erik Duhaime is a passive stock market investor, but he isn't afraid to short Donald Trump or go long on Hillary Clinton.The 28-year-old from Cambridge, Massachusetts, trades on PredictIt, an online political stock market that allows users to wager small amounts of money on ""yes"" or ""no"" predictions about whether an event will occur. That includes who will win the U.S. presidential election in November.""This is probably one of the ways I restrain myself from being active in the stock market,"" said Duhaime, a PhD student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management, who checks the site a few times a week for fun.PredictIt, which was launched in 2014, now has more than 30,000 traders registered, up from 19,000 at the end of 2015, and has received shout-outs from pundits and presidential campaign advisors alike. Users must be U.S. residents and registered voters.PredictIt says it is not like an online gambling site because it mainly exists to supply its data to universities for academic research, one of the main reasons the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission allows it to operate legally, according to a letter issued by the regulator in 2014. It is jointly run by Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, and a Washington-based political consulting firm Aristotle International Inc. Unlike mainstream financial markets, bets are not big: The CFTC caps each participant's position at $850 per market, and the average deposit when people sign up is just $100.The regulator hasn't been as friendly to such betting sites in the past. In 2012, the CFTC filed a civil complaint against the now defunct Intrade for violating a ban on off-exchange options trading. The Ireland-based market also allowed people to wager money on ""yes"" or ""no"" questions, but it wasn't tied to an academic institution and didn't have a cap on the maximum amount that could be traded.     
MARKET BEATS POLLING
Predictions markets like PredictIt and a similar venue run by the University of Iowa have emerged as an alternative to polling for election forecasters. PredictIt is bigger than the Iowa Electronic Markets, which has only about 2,000 active traders with access to its political markets.""Polling is very expensive,"" said David Rothschild, an economist at Microsoft Research who runs a predictions-market aggregator called PredictWise, which draws heavily from PredictIt. ""It's a slow process. It's not very flexible.""
Knowledge of polls does also feed into betting decisions on PredictIt. ""Predictions markets translate this and other information into probability,"" said Rajiv Sethi, professor of economics at Barnard College. ""The basic intuition is that it's a 'wisdom of crowds' effect.""    For example, Trump's chances of securing the Republican nomination for the presidential election swung dramatically on the site over the past three months as the primary season progressed. A Trump share shot from 30 cents in early February when he lost to rival Ted Cruz in the Iowa primary to 80 cents a month later when Trump dominated on Super Tuesday. They then lost half their value by early April as Cruz appeared to regain momentum with a big win in Wisconsin. With Cruz and another rival, John Kasich, now out of the race, Trump had risen to 94 cents by Monday.For graphic showing Trump's ascendancy on PredictIt during primary season, see tmsnrt.rs/1WmRqFor November's election, though, Trump is trailing on PredictIt with 40 cents against Clinton's 59 cents. While PredictIt's precision has yet to be closely examined by academics, other predictions markets such as the Iowa Electronic Markets, have proven to be just as accurate as polls, experts who have studied them said.PredictIt markets go beyond topics related to U.S. elections. Users also put the probability of a North Korea hydrogen bomb test this year at only 29 cents, and a British exit from the European Union by 2017 at just 30 cents.
The idea for PredictIt was first thought up in the mid-1990s by Lew Evans, professor of economics at the University of Victoria.It took until 2008, for the market, called ""iPredict"" in New Zealand, to get up and running. Early on, it focused primarily on New Zealand politics, and research showed iPredict out-performed the majority of polls in predicting the results in two of New Zealand's last three general elections. However, new anti-money laundering laws in New Zealand put an end to iPredict last year after the cost of verifying users' identities to comply with the rules threatened to blow through iPredict's shoe-string budget.              
PRIMARY PARTY

PredictIt attracts everyone from campaign volunteers to political junkies.In mid-April, about 30 PredictIt traders gathered at a bar in New York to watch the state's primary results roll in.""I think it's a good source of collective wisdom,"" said Brian Hegarty, who was at the event.Hegarty, who worked for Kasich's campaign, reads political news, but also relied on picking up information through his campaign experience. That didn't always translate to a bet in favor of Kasich. He said he put money on Republican candidate Marco Rubio to win the Minnesota caucus because he had overheard someone who was working for the Florida senator express confidence about Rubio's chances. It turned out to be one of the few states Rubio won before dropping out in mid-March.Duhaime, the MIT student, said he usually bets against candidates he believes are likely to flame out. ""For me, Trump was one of those people,"" he said. ""I shorted Trump way back in July, and it hasn't been fun watching."" After Trump's win in Indiana in early May, Duhaime was down nearly $1,000, about a third of the money he put into PredictIt. ""I still think it was a one in a hundred thing,"" Duhaime, who doesn't identify as a Democrat but is a fan of President Barack Obama, said of the Trump phenomenon. ""Obviously I'm bummed, but I'm sort of more concerned for other reasons.""(This version of the story corrects the spelling of Lew Evans) (Reporting by Anjali Athavaley in New York and Charlotte Greenfield in New Zealand; Editing by Martin Howell)"
