ROME Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who had openly supported Hillary Clinton, congratulated Donald Trump on his victory in the U.S. presidential elections and said Italy's ties with the United States remained strong.""I wish him well. The Italo-American friendship is solid,"" Renzi said at the start of a speech in Rome. 
Renzi was one of the few world leaders to endorse Clinton and opposition politicians were swift to condemn him on Wednesday, saying that by doing so, he had weakened Rome's international standing.

JAKARTA Donald Trump's U.S. election victory may create fresh tension between the United States and the Islamic world, an official at Indonesia's top Muslim clerical body said on Wednesday.Trump, who once proposed a ban on Muslims entering the United States, stunned the world by defeating heavily favored Hillary Clinton in the presidential race, ending eight years of Democratic rule.Trump had made ""negative, cynical"" comments about Muslims in the past, Din Syamsuddin, a senior official at the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), told reporters in Jakarta. ""He had forgotten that many Americans are immigrants.""
Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population.

By Arshad Mohammed and Jonathan Landay
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. President-elect Donald Trump may try to improve ties with Russia, tear up trade deals with Mexico and Pacific nations and abandon U.S. allies in Europe and Asia if they don't spend more on their own defense - or, he may not.Foreign governments are uncertain how much of Trump's rhetoric will be translated into policy because he has frequently made contradictory statements and provided few details of how he would deal with the world or who he would appoint to key posts.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault pledged to work with Trump but said his personality ""raised questions"" and he admitted to being unsure what a Trump presidency would mean for key foreign policy challenges, from climate change and the West's nuclear deal with Iran to the war in Syria.Trump, who has no foreign affairs or military experience, will confront the absence of a national or even Republican political consensus on how to deal with Syria, the Islamic State militant group, the rise of China and a newly assertive Russia.""This is virtual terra incognita,"" said Aaron David Miller, a Middle East negotiator who served Democratic and Republican presidents and is now with the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars in Washington.""The biggest danger of a Trump presidency is the unpredictability and sheer lack of stability that our allies and adversaries would feel, and he turns that into a virtue by saying that he wants to be unpredictable,"" he said.Among the names said to be in consideration for top national security jobs in a Trump administration are former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich and one-time United Nations ambassador John Bolton for secretary of state, and General Michael Flynn, a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, for national security adviser.A Republican foreign policy expert who has occasionally counseled Trump, cautioned that he is more likely to make his own decisions and impulses than to follow the advice of his aides.Many top Republicans have publicly repudiated him, and a number of professional diplomats, intelligence and military officers have privately said they would retire if Trump wins.""If he does everything he says he's going to do, we can kiss goodbye our leadership role in the world,"" former CIA deputy director John McLaughlin told Reuters. ""So let's hope he doesn't mean it or that someone talks him out of it.""Trump has suggested he could accept Japanese and South Korean nuclear arms development, abandon the Iran nuclear deal, negotiate with North Korea on its nuclear weapons program, and embrace Russian President Vladimir Putin.
GETTING ALONG WITH RUSSIA?
Trump has adopted an open-minded stance toward Putin, whom many current and former U.S. officials consider an autocrat bent on suppressing dissent at home while bullying his neighbors and projecting Russia's power abroad.Russia has annexed Crimea from Ukraine, backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and, according to U.S. intelligence officials, hacked  emails of prominent Democratic Party leaders and organizations.""I would hope to have a good relationship with Russia and I would hope to have a good relationship with Putin,"" Trump told Reuters in an interview last month. ""If we had a good relationship with Russia that would be a wonderful thing.""James Dobbins, a former U.S. diplomat now at the Rand Corp., said he would not be surprised to see an effort to ""reset"" U.S. relations with Russia.
Trump has taken a more aggressive tone toward China, threatening to slap tariffs on Chinese products to show Beijing the United States is ""not playing games anymore"" when it comes to leveling the field on trade. China's Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday it would work with Trump to ensure the steady development of bilateral ties.Trump also says he could scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement that took effect in Mexico, the United States and Canada in 1994, and he has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 35 percent on Mexican-made goods to help U.S. industry.Trump has taken aim at the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal championed by President Barack Obama, calling it a ""death blow"" for American manufacturing. 
""LESS CONFLICT-AVERSE""
Trump has also floated the idea of abandoning NATO's guarantee of mutual defense, suggesting that the United States would help defend other NATO members such as the Baltic states only if they had ""fulfilled their obligations to us.""Asked in March if he would object if Japan or South Korea developed their own nuclear weapons, Trump told the New York Times there might come a time that the United States could not protect them as it has in the past and they might need to develop their own arsenals.Both positions violate bedrock principles of U.S. foreign policy that have stood for decades: that an attack on one NATO member would be regarded as an attack on all and that the proliferation of nuclear weapons is to be avoided at all costs.Jon Alterman, the head of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, said Trump's predilection for keeping other nations guessing could itself be a source of instability.""Countries may feel more at risk and maybe less conflict-averse if they feel they have to protect themselves,"" he said.Robert Zoellick, a former deputy secretary of state who in May signed a letter saying Trump ""would be the most reckless president on American history,"" suggested that Trump's temperament could lead to unexpected outcomes.""No one knows how Mr. Trump's vanity will respond if a foreign counterpart diminishes him,"" he wrote in the Financial Times last month.

By Steve Holland
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Donald Trump's White House victory puts a spotlight on Reince Priebus, an establishment Republican figure who emerged as a trusted adviser to the New York businessman and helped encourage discipline in the campaign's final weeks.Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, has been mentioned as a contender for chief of staff.In a pre-election interview, Priebus told Reuters that Trump won over voters who were frustrated with Washington and its politicians.""They viewed Donald Trump as the antidote to so many things that they're frustrated with, whether it be Washington, whether it be their job, whether it be what they were promised, and all sorts of things in life, and how it wasn't delivered,"" he said. ""And Trump was the antidote to all of those feelings.""Trump's victory was a vindication for Priebus, who refused to bow to pressure to distance the party apparatus from him. He talked to Trump almost every day, sometimes more than once a day, and frequently traveled with the candidate. He helped prepare him for Trump's debates against Democrat Hillary Clinton.Trump made clear his high regard for Priebus when he invited him on stage during his victory speech early Wednesday morning and asked him to say a few words.Comparing Priebus to the race horse Secretariat, Trump said, ""I tell you Reince is really a star and he is the hardest-working guy.""Henry Barbour, an RNC member from Mississippi, said Priebus had ""developed a position of trust"" with Trump.
""He had regular conversations with Trump about different ideas and not surprisingly some ideas Trump had were probably not the greatest and Reince kind of talked him off some of those cliffs,"" he said.Once Trump vanquished 16 seasoned politicians to win the Republican presidential nomination, Priebus threw the weight of the RNC behind Trump and built a voter turnout effort that paid off despite Trump's refusal to invest more money in it.""He has been a prodigious fundraiser. He invested heavily in bringing our data and analytics up to speed, and he put the full resources of the RNC to help build out the Trump campaign,"" said Steve Duprey, a prominent Republican from New Hampshire. ""And he helped coach Donald Trump in how to be a presidential candidate."" 
Trump's unpredictable nature and views on issues such as trade that break with Republican party orthodoxy have led to rifts with many establishment figures in the party.But Priebus told Reuters that his staunch support for Trump was based on the fact that Trump won more Republican votes than any previous nominee, 14.5 million.""These are the same people who say the party is irrelevant and in the next breath they say that the party ought to singlehandedly nullify the wishes of 14.5 million people,"" he said.If Trump had lost, Priebus would have faced pressure to step down as party chairman, since he also presided over the loss of Mitt Romney in 2012. He remains extremely popular among the 168 elected members of the RNC who would most likely re-elect him.
Priebus is being talked about for re-election at the RNC or possibly being appointed by Trump to serve as his White House chief of staff, where he may be a potential conduit between Trump and Paul Ryan, the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.Both Priebus and Ryan hail from Wisconsin and are friends.""We hope Priebus goes into the Trump White House in a senior position,"" said Scott Reed, a prominent Republican strategist in Washington.Asked whether he would seek re-election as RNC chairman, Priebus said he did not yet know.""I've honestly put that in a box and decided that I would deal with it Wednesday or Thursday, kind of think about it a little bit, kind of see where things are at,"" he said.

| MIAMI/WASHINGTON

MIAMI/WASHINGTON Fed up with Washington and feeling left behind, supporters of Republican Donald Trump upended the U.S. presidential race, electing a political newcomer they say offers the country a shot at dramatic change.Once dismissed by Trump's Democratic rival Hillary Clinton as ""deplorables,"" supporters interviewed on Tuesday shrugged off his late-night tweeted insults, allegations against him of sexual misconduct and dire warnings from many in the Republican establishment that the businessman-turned-reality-television-star would throw U.S. economic and foreign policy into disarray.The economy, terrorism and healthcare ranked as the top three concerns facing Americans casting ballots in Tuesday's election, according to an early reading from the Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll of about 35,000 people.""The freedom-loving Americans pushed back against the elites and the globalists. They might win in the long run, but we're not dead yet,"" said Andrew Dye, 48, of Dexter, Michigan.""I think this big country is getting a little too far left a little too quickly and some people finally woke up and said enough,"" said Dye, a partner in a small management consulting firm.Cuban-American Sarah Gird, 67, described herself as an independent who had felt let down after twice voting for Democratic President Barack Obama.""I'm not conservative at all,"" she said. But Obama ""didn't produce anything."" In contrast, she said she trusted Trump would fix the economy.""I think he's sincere, he's truthful, he means what he says,"" said Gird, adding she thought Trump would address poverty and jobs in African-American neighborhoods.
For many, the vote was a rejection of Clinton, whose use of a private email server during her time in government came to symbolize what is wrong with Washington.""All the corruption. I'm tired of business as usual, being sold out all these years,"" said Kevin Barrett, 57, in Nashville.Tom Kipp, 53, an architect also of Nashville, said he voted for Trump because ""we need somebody in there not beholden to anyone.""""Our checks and balances system is beyond being compromised. I don't say he's my prime candidate, but he's my best option,"" Kipp said.
Others found Trump's promise to build a wall on the southern border with Mexico appealing.""Last-minute decision: I changed my mind to Trump,"" said Lisa Ciafone, 48, of Madeira Beach, Florida, citing her concerns about illegal immigration and the rising costs of health insurance. ""It made me lean towards Trump.""Vicki DeLira, 54, a dental hygienist from Schererville, Indiana, grew up a Democrat but voted for Trump because it was time for change even if it means ""a little bit of chaos.""""It will be a little different atmosphere for a non-politician to be in the White House,"" DeLira said. ""But I think there's enough politicians around him to help round them out.""
Todd Recknagel, managing partner of private equity firm Three20 Capital Group, said the caricature of Trump as a ""monster"" was overdone.""He is an effective business man at the end of the day. So things are never quite as good as they appear and things are never quite as bad as they appear in life and I think he can make a decent president,"" said Recknagel, 52, from Panama City Beach, Florida.As Trump became the projected winner in state after state, fans from Arkansas, Texas and Virginia sitting on velvet sofas in the lobby of his new Washington luxury hotel just down the street from the White House celebrated as waiters popped champagne.Preston Parry, 20, had bet all along that Trump would defy the pollsters who predicted a Clinton victory.""These were shadow voters, people who had never, ever voted before that the polls didn't pick up. Unlikely voters. Like him or hate him - look, he did something right.""

BRUSSELS European Parliament President Martin Schulz on Wednesday said he hoped for a ""rational cooperation"" with Donald Trump as the next U.S. president after a bitter political campaign. ""It will not be easy because during the election campaign we heard some elements of protectionism, also some worrying words about women, about minorities,"" said Schulz, a German Social Democrat.""But my experience is also that election campaigns are different from the real politics during a term of the president so I hope that we will get back to a rational cooperation,"" he said in televised remarks.In a separate written statement, he highlighted need for Trump to formulate more detailed policies after a campaign that capitalized on voters' discontent with the status quo and he also listed key international policies that could be affected by the change of administration in Washington.
""Mr. Trump has managed to become the standard-bearer of the angst and fears of millions of Americans. Those concerns must now be addressed with credible policies,"" Schulz said. ""Vitriol and polarization have fueled this electoral contest. President Trump will have the daunting task of bringing together a divided nation.
""From Syria to Iraq, from Ukraine to Libya, Trump's role in diplomacy and dealmaking will be tested from Day One,"" he added.""From the fight against global warming to its commitment to NATO, the world awaits and hopes for an outward-looking presidency aiming at shaping international relations and upholding the values of freedom and democracy.""
