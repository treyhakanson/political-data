By Patricia Zengerle and Roberta Rampton
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama on Friday vetoed legislation allowing families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia, which could prompt Congress to overturn his decision with a rare veto override, the first of his presidency.Obama said the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act would hurt U.S. national security and harm important alliances, while shifting crucial terrorism-related issues from policy officials into the hands of the courts.The bill passed the Senate and House of Representatives in reaction to long-running suspicions, denied by Saudi Arabia, that hijackers of the four U.S. jetliners that attacked the United States in 2001 were backed by the Saudi government.Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals.Obama said other countries could use the law, known as JASTA, as an excuse to sue U.S. diplomats, members of the military or companies - even for actions of foreign organizations that had received U.S. aid, equipment or training.""Removing sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated as state sponsors of terrorism, based solely on allegations that such foreign governments' actions abroad had a connection to terrorism-related injuries on U.S. soil, threatens to undermine these longstanding principles that protect the United States, our forces, and our personnel,"" Obama said in a statement.Senator Chuck Schumer, who co-wrote the legislation and has championed it, immediately made clear how difficult it will be for Obama to sustain the veto.Schumer, the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate, issued a statement within moments of receiving the veto, promising that it would be ""swiftly and soundly overturned."" He represents New York, home of most of the Sept. 11 victims.
Both the Democratic and Republican candidates for president, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, said they would have signed the bill into law if they were in the White House.SOME DOUBTS 
If two-thirds of the lawmakers in both the Senate and House vote to override, the law would stand, the first such override since he became president in 2009, and possibly the last. 
Obama leaves office in January. Friday's veto was the twelfth of his presidency.An override has been expected, despite some lawmakers saying they had doubts about the measure.In a letter seen by Reuters on Friday, Republican Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the powerful House Armed Services Committee, said he would oppose the override.""My primary concern is that this bill increases the risk posed to American military and intelligence personnel, diplomats and others serving our country around the world,"" Thornberry wrote in a letter encouraging his fellow Republicans to sustain the veto.
House Speaker Paul Ryan said Wednesday he thought there were enough votes to override a veto, but had concerns. ""I worry about trial lawyers trying to get rich off of this. And I do worry about the precedent,"" he told reporters.The ""9/11 Families & Survivors United for Justice Against Terrorism"" group, which has pressed Congress to uphold the legislation, called Obama's veto explanation ""unconvincing and unsupportable.""The Saudi government has lobbied heavily to stop the bill,  the European Union has formally opposed it and Gulf States have condemned it.Major U.S. corporations such as General Electric and Dow Chemical have also pressed lawmakers to reconsider.""The bill is not balanced, sets a dangerous precedent, and has real potential to destabilize vital bilateral relationships and the global economy,"" GE Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who supports the bill.

By Ginger Gibson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON When Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton face off in their first presidential debate together on Monday, they will have their best chance yet to win over the roughly 27 million Americans who have yet to decide who to vote for.In some ways, this group looks like a typical Trump supporter: they are mainly white, without college degrees, older, and frustrated by the status quo. But while Trump's supporters are mostly men, America's uncommitted voters are mostly women, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.With polls showing a close fight between Trump and Hillary, this is a group that could decide the election. Katie Packer, a Republican strategist who served as a top aide to Mitt Romney in 2012 said polls show that many undecided women have been put off by Trump's inflammatory rhetoric, while others see Clinton, the first female presidential candidate from a major U.S. party, as dishonest.""These are the same women who don't trust Hillary and think she's phony,"" she said. ""But Trump is scary to them.""    Roughly 20 percent of America's likely voters are still on the fence, compared to just 12 percent at the same time in the 2012 election, underscoring the unpopularity of both Trump and Clinton. Some 77 percent of them think the country is on the ""wrong track,"" which puts them more in line with Trump supporters than Clinton backers. They are also similar in age to many Trump backers: some 54 percent are at least 55 years old. And 67 percent never earned a college degree, compared with 71 percent for Trump supporters and 56 percent for Clinton supporters.Gender-wise, they track more closely with Clinton's base. Some 60 percent are women. Trump's base is made up of about 48 percent women, compared with 52 percent for Clinton.
The most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found Clinton leading Trump by 4 percentage points in a two-way race. The Democratic nominee has mostly led Trump in the poll this year, but the gap between the two candidates has narrowed with six weeks left before the Nov. 8 election. TORN
With neither candidate a clear favorite on issues like creating jobs or keeping the nation safe, nearly a third of uncommitted voters said they may be more likely to vote for a third-party candidate than for either Clinton or Trump.""One of the most important issues in this election is just making sure that our country has a future both through education and jobs,"" said undecided voter Erika Szotek, 43, of Hanover Park, Illinois, who voted for Romney in 2012.
She said she thought Trump's ""flamboyancy is going to get the country into a lot of trouble with other countries."" But she isn't sold on Clinton either. ""There are some things I just don't trust about her."" Women have been a lingering problem for Trump, whose unfiltered speaking style and fiery rhetoric on immigration and security have put many off. He has also gotten into trouble for some remarks he has made about women.He was widely criticized for saying Fox News host Megyn Kelly had ""blood coming out of her wherever,"" a comment many interpreted as referring to her menstruating, although he insisted that was not what he meant. He has also called television personality Rosie O'Donnell a ""fat pig"" and made fun of former presidential rival and ex-Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina's face, saying, ""Would anyone vote for that?""
Clinton's campaign has seized on the vulnerability. This week it launched an ad titled ""Mirrors"" that shows images of girls looking in mirrors while recordings of Trump comment on women's weight and breast size, calling them ""slob,"" ""pig,"" and ""fat.""  But Clinton has her own troubles.Multiple polls show that her use of a private email server without approval while secretary of state has deepened voters' mistrust of her even though she has since acknowledged it was a mistake. Trump frequently calls her ""Crooked Hillary.""FBI director James Comey recommended in July that no criminal charges be brought against Clinton for her handling of classified information while she was secretary of state, but he called her use of the server ""extremely careless.""    Ruth Hammett, 77, of Kingsland, Georgia, said she would be looking to the debates for guidance on which candidate to support. She is leaning toward Clinton but wants to hear both candidates address national security.   ""I'm very scared, most so for my kids and my grandkids,"" Hammett said. ""I'm scared to death.""

By Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON In an abrupt shift, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz endorsed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Friday, saying he is the only candidate who can stop Democrat Hillary Clinton from winning the White House on Nov. 8.""A year ago, I pledged to endorse the Republican nominee, and I am honoring that commitment. And if you don't want to see a Hillary Clinton presidency, I encourage you to vote for him,"" the former Republican presidential candidate said in a lengthy statement.Cruz, a senator from Texas who is a favorite of the conservative Tea Party movement, was one of Trump's last challengers for the Republican presidential nomination to drop out of the race.When Cruz addressed the Republican National Convention in July in Cleveland, where Trump accepted the nomination, he declined to endorse Trump and was essentially booed off stage by the New York businessman's supporters.During the heated primary battle, Trump had insulted Cruz's wife, Heidi, for her physical appearance. His wild suggestion that the senator's father was linked to President John F. Kennedy's assassin prompted Cruz to denounce Trump as a ""pathological liar.""In July, Trump said, ""I don't want his endorsement."" On Friday he said he was greatly honored to have Cruz backing him.
""We have fought the battle and he was a tough and brilliant opponent. I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again,"" Trump said.Cruz cited the possibility of Democrats taking control of the U.S. Supreme Court as a major reason why he decided to drop his opposition to Trump.Trump earlier in the day released the names of 21 prominent conservatives and said he would pick from this list in nominating a replacement for conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February.
The Senate has refused to take any action on President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland, chief judge of the federal appeals court in Washington, to fill the vacancy.One of the names on Trump's list was that of U.S. Senator Mike Lee of Utah, a key ally of Cruz.Cruz said that for some time he had been seeking greater specificity on Trump's views toward filling the opening on the court, which is currently deadlocked between four right-leaning and four left-leaning jurists.
He said Trump's list ""provides a serious reason for voters to choose to support Trump"" and that Lee ""would make an extraordinary justice.""Cruz noted his qualms about Trump, saying, ""I have struggled to determine the right course of action in this general election.""But in the end, he decided, Trump ""is the only thing standing in the way"" of a Clinton presidency that he said would be devastating to the United States.

By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democrat Hillary Clinton had a four-percentage point advantage in support over Republican Donald Trump ahead of their first U.S. presidential debate, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll released on Friday.The Sept. 16-22 opinion poll showed that 41 percent of likely voters supported Clinton, while 37 percent supported Trump. Clinton has mostly led Trump in the poll during the 2016 campaign, though her advantage has narrowed since the end of the Democratic and Republican national conventions in July.With just six weeks before the Nov. 8 election, Monday's debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York will be the first of three between the White House rivals. It presents a major opportunity for them to appeal to voters who have yet to commit to a candidate after a mostly negative race in which Clinton and Trump have sought to brand each other as untrustworthy and dangerous for the country.The live, televised matchup is expected to draw a Super Bowl-sized television audience of 100 million Americans, according to some commentators.
Among those watching will be people who so far remain on the fence. This could be a sizable group: Some 22 percent of likely voters said in the latest poll that they do not support either major-party candidate. That was more than twice the proportion of uncommitted voters at the same point in the 2012 election between Democratic President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney.These uncommitted voters appear to be leaning more toward Trump than Clinton, according to the latest poll, though they have not been convinced enough to say they will vote for him in November. It was also possible that some of these voters would pick an alternative-party candidate like Libertarian Gary Johnson or the Green Party's Jill Stein.
Clinton led a separate four-way poll that included Trump, Johnson and Stein. Among likely voters, 39 percent supported Clinton, 37 percent favored Trump, 7 percent picked Johnson and 2 percent supported Stein.The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English in the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii. It included 1,559 respondents who were considered to be likely voters given their voting history, registration status and stated intention to show up on Election Day. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points, meaning results could vary by that much either way.
National polls have produced varying measurements of support for Clinton and Trump during the 2016 campaign. The differences are partly due to the fact that some polls, like Reuters/Ipsos, try to include only likely voters, while others include all registered voters. The Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll gathers responses every day and reports results twice a week, so it often detects trends in sentiment before most other polls. Polling aggregators, which calculate averages of major polls, have shown that Clinton's lead over Trump has been shrinking this month. The most recent individual polls put her advantage at 3 percentage points. (Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Jonathan Oatis)"	['Romney', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

By Roberta Rampton
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The White House budget office scheduled a call with U.S government agencies on Friday to plan for a government shutdown in case the U.S. Congress fails to pass a short-term funding bill by a deadline next week.""It is our hope that this work will ultimately be unnecessary and that there will be no lapse in appropriations,"" a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) said in a statement.The federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30 and Congress must pass a spending measure by then to keep the government open. In recent years, lawmakers have seldom agreed on a full federal budget and instead have relied on stop-gap measures.
On Thursday, Republicans produced a bill which Democrats immediately rejected. The Senate is expected to hold an initial procedural vote on the legislation on Tuesday, according to a senior Republican aide. The White House was pleased that bill includes funding to fight the Zika virus, but has concerns about other provisions, spokesman Josh Earnest said, noting that it was ""too soon to panic"" about the bill.
""I think it is unclear at best right now whether or not this particular piece of legislation will pass both houses of Congress and make its way to the president's desk. Even if it were, it's also unclear at best right now if the president would sign it,"" Earnest told reporters.The OMB said there was enough time for Congress to pass a short-term funding bill, but ""prudent management requires that the government plan for the possibility of a lapse.""
Republicans and Democrats annually fight about spending bills but normally reach a deal to avert a shutdown, particularly during election years. In 2013, the two sides failed to agree, and the government stopped operations for 16 days. (Additional reporting by Ayesha Rascoe and David Morgan; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Sandra Maler)"	[]	[]

WASHINGTON Most of the emails the FBI recovered during its investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email system while secretary of state will not be made available until after the Nov. 8 presidential election under a timetable set by a judge on Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported.The judge ordered the U.S. State Department to finish processing 1,050 pages of material for release by Nov. 4, just days before Americans go to the polls, the Wall Street Journal said. The paper said that material was out of what could be as much as 10,000 pages.Under the schedule set by the judge, there will be also be pre-election releases on Oct. 7 and Oct. 21, and the State Department will process 500 pages per month after that, the Wall Street Journal reported.
The State Department is responding to dozens of lawsuits brought over Clinton's use of a private, home-based email system while she was the agency's top diplomat from 2009 to 2013.The timetable announced on Friday was in a lawsuit brought by Judicial Watch, a conservative group that has filed multiple lawsuits to obtain government records related to Clinton's tenure as secretary of state.
""The State Department voluntarily agreed to produce to Judicial Watch any emails sent or received by Secretary Clinton in her official capacity during her tenure as Secretary of State which are contained within the material turned over by the FBI,"" agency spokesman John Kirby said in a statement.

BERLIN Activists from the online campaign group Avaaz tore down a cardboard wall near the site of the former Berlin Wall on Friday to urge American expats in Germany to vote against Republican nominee Donald Trump in the U.S. election on Nov. 8.Many identify Trump with his proposal to build a huge border wall between the United States and Mexico to keep migrants out; moreover, the event was staged in front of the Brandenburg Gate, near the place where U.S. president Ronald Reagan publicly urged Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987 to ""tear down this wall"".Holding red and blue placards saying ""Stop Trump"" and ""Tear Down Trump's Wall"", dozens of cheering activists toppled the 2.5 meter (8.2 foot) structure, emblazoned with a picture of Trump, with their hands and rubber mallets.Many of the 150 or so onlookers chanted ""The wall must come down!"" as it was knocked over. 
Around 8 million Americans live abroad but only 12 percent of them voted in the 2012 election, Avaaz said in a statement.
""Americans abroad are the 'Swing State' that nobody knows about, who could, however, decide the vote this year. A large number of them live in Germany,"" said Emma Ruby-Sachs, deputy director of Avaaz.In a Reuters/Ipsos poll published last week, 42 percent of likely voters supported Clinton, a former secretary of state, and 38 percent backed the Republican real estate tycoon.

By Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Donald Trump on Friday named U.S. Senator Mike Lee as a potential Supreme Court nominee, turning to an ally of former rival Ted Cruz in an apparent gesture to conservative Republicans who have been wary of the Republican presidential candidate. Lee was included on a new list of 21 potential Supreme Court justices that Trump would consider for the high court if he is elected over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election.""This list is definitive and I will choose only from it in picking future justices of the United States Supreme Court,"" Trump said in a statement.The announcement came out on a day in which neither candidate had a public event and were preparing for Monday's first presidential debate.The list Trump announced included 10 new names and 11 conservative jurists from a list the New York businessman had announced in May. Lee's brother, Thomas Lee, an associate justice of the Utah Supreme Court, was on the initial list and remains on Trump's expanded list.Trump's listing of Mike Lee amounted to a gesture to U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas, a conservative who fought Trump fiercely as a rival for the Republican presidential nomination and who has refused to endorse Trump.
Trump's bombastic style and proposals breaking with some conservative orthodoxies such as support for free trade agreements have sparked unease among traditional conservative Republicans. Mike Lee, in a statement, said he appreciated being considered.""Right now I'm focused on my job in the Senate, where I'm in a good position to defend the Constitution by fighting against government overreach. Both lists that I've seen from the Trump campaign are fantastic. 
""While my brother and I might disagree as to which list is better, they're both great,"" he quipped.The death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia on Feb. 13 left the court with a four-to-four tie between right-leaning and left-leaning justices.Democratic President Barack Obama has nominated Merrick Garland, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, but the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate has refused to consider confirming him.
Trump said his list was based on who would follow constitutional principles on the high court. The possibility of Republicans ceding control of the court to the Democrats has been one of his main rallying cries at campaign events.Others on Trump's list include Keith Blackwell, a justice on the Supreme Court of Georgia; Charles Canady, a Florida Supreme Court justice; Neil Gorsuch, a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, and Edward Mansfield, an Iowa Supreme Court justice.Other names included Federico Moreno, a judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida; Margaret Ryan, a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces; Amul Thapar, a judge of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky; Timothy Tymkovich, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit; and Robert Young, chief justice of the Supreme Court of Michigan.

By Emily Flitter
| PITTSBURGH

PITTSBURGH Donald Trump on Thursday praised aggressive police tactics and condemned attacks on officers amid criticism of his plan to use ""stop-and-frisk"" tactics to reduce crime, in a speech following a second night of unrest that shook Charlotte, North Carolina.The Republican presidential nominee said drugs were ""a very, very big factor"" in urban unrest and that those suffering the most from the violence were ""law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities.""""Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration,"" Trump told an energy conference in Pittsburgh, as a room full of natural gas and coal industry executives listened in silence.""The violence against our citizens, and our law enforcement, must be brought to an end,"" he added.Trump has portrayed himself as the ""law-and-order"" candidate. Stop-and-frisk, in which police stop, question and search pedestrians for weapons or contraband, has drawn protests and successful legal challenges because it is seen as unfairly targeting minorities.At the same time, Trump has recently reached out to African-American voters as the gap in many opinion polls has narrowed between him and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election.Clinton, who did not immediately respond to Trump's remarks on Thursday, has pushed for stricter gun controls to help rein in gun violence and called for the development of national guidelines on the use of force by police officers.In Pittsburgh, Trump, a New York businessman, called for better training of police and more community engagement.""If you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night,"" Trump said. ""My administration will work with local communities and local officials to make the reduction of crime a top priority.""
Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said later in a statement that Trump's comments were not referring ""specifically"" to the violence in Charlotte, but ""addressing a major concern that authorities and moms across the country are raising with him, which is indiscriminate drug use and opiate addiction.""The fatal police shooting of a black man sparked the protests in Charlotte, and a state of emergency was declared on Wednesday. There have also been protests in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in recent days after a fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man who a video showed had his hands in clear view at the time. A white Tulsa officer was charged with first-degree manslaughter on Thursday in the shooting.Police tactics and deadly encounters with African-Americans, many of them unarmed, have sparked protests and unrest across the country in recent years. Clinton said on Wednesday that the deaths in Charlotte and Tulsa added two more names to the list of African-American victims of police killings. ""It's unbearable, and it needs to become intolerable,"" she said.
'THEY'LL TAKE THE GUN AWAY'
Trump was at an African-American church in Cleveland on Wednesday when he praised stop-and-frisk, which had triggered protests and court rulings that it was unconstitutional or required outside monitoring in cities like New York, Chicago and Newark, New Jersey.Before going to Pittsburgh, Trump was asked on Fox News' ""Fox and Friends"" program to define the tactic. He said: ""If they see a person possibly with a gun or they think may have a gun, they will see the person and they'll look and they'll take the gun away.""""They'll stop, they'll frisk, and they'll take the gun away. And they won't have anything to shoot with,"" he said.
In Washington, White House spokesman John Earnest pointed to what he said was a contradiction in Trump's remarks.""It does raise questions that a politician would be so dogmatic about protecting Second Amendment rights (to bear arms) yet rather cavalier about protecting the constitutional prohibition against illegal search and seizure,"" he told a news briefing.While Trump did not mention stop-and-frisk by name in Pittsburgh, he used the speech to repeat his praise for the policing tactics fostered by former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, now a major Trump supporter, who promoted the practice. Trump again credited policing under the Republican mayor with reducing crime in the candidate's hometown.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio rejected that argument on Thursday, warning Trump against embracing a tactic that would  worsen relations between police and the minority community.De Blasio attributed the sharp drop in crime to another strategy adopted by Bill Bratton, the city's longtime police commissioner, who retired less than a week ago.Bratton championed the ""broken windows"" policing strategy that emphasizes pursuit of crimes no matter how minor. In his resignation letter, he attributed the decline in crime in New York, the nation's most populous city with 8.5 million people, to additional officers and an emphasis on building bonds within neighborhoods. De Blasio, who supports Clinton, said in an interview with CNN that Trump ""should really be careful because if we reinstitute stop-and-frisk all over this country, you would see a lot more tension between police and community.""
