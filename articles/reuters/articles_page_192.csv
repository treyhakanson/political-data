By Richard Cowan and John Whitesides
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate on Monday rejected four measures restricting gun sales after last week's massacre in an Orlando nightclub, dealing a bitter setback to advocates who have failed to get even modest gun curbs through Congress despite repeated mass shootings.A group of senators was still hoping to forge a compromise for later in the week aimed at keeping firearms away from people on terrorism watch lists, although that effort faced an uphill battle with critics in both parties skeptical about its chances.Last week's massacre, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, had intensified pressure on lawmakers, who moved swiftly to take the issue to the Senate floor. But the gun-control measures lost in largely party-line votes that showed the lingering political power in Congress of gun rights defenders and the National Rifle Association.Republicans and their allies in the NRA gun lobby said the Democratic bills were too restrictive and trampled on the constitutional right to bear arms. Democrats attacked the Republicans' two proposals as too weak and accused them of being in the thrall of the NRA.""What am I going to tell the community of Orlando?"" asked Democratic Senator Bill Nelson of Florida after the votes. ""Sadly, what I'm going to tell them is the NRA won again.""Chris Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action, attacked the Democrats' amendments and thanked Republicans for rejecting them. ""Today, the American people witnessed an embarrassing display in the United States,"" he said.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said the Democratic measures were ineffective and Republican senators ""are pursuing real solutions that can help keep Americans safer from the threat of terrorism.""As the parties remain largely locked in their positions,  polls show Americans are increasingly in favor of more restrictions on guns in a country with more than 310 million weapons, about one for every citizen. The issue is already a prominent one for voters in November elections. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton supports new gun restrictions, while Republican Donald Trump expressed a willingness to talk to the NRA about the issue.
After the votes, Clinton issued a one-word statement: ""Enough."" It was followed by the names and ages of the dead in Orlando.Gun control efforts failed after mass shootings at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 and a conference center in San Bernardino, California, in 2015. But some senators see resistance to gun restrictions softening as national security looms larger in the debate.The Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to the militant group Islamic State as he killed 49 people in a gay nightclub. ""This country is under attack ... it's not a plane or an explosive device, it's an assault weapon,"" said Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat who led a 15-hour filibuster last week to draw attention to the effort to restrict guns.
'SHAME ON EVERY SINGLE SENATOR'
Murphy walked off the floor after the Senate votes and embraced Erica Smegielski, the daughter of Dawn Hochsprung, a Sandy Hook principal killed during the Newtown shooting.""He said, the good thing about me and you is we're young, we'll be at this a long time,"" said Smegielski, 30.A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted last week found that 71 percent of Americans favor at least moderate regulations and restrictions on gun sales. That compared with 60 percent in late 2013 and late 2014.
Senior Senate aides left open the possibility of other votes later in the week on unspecified gun control proposals. Some Republicans pinned hopes on a proposal by Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, which was not one of the four bills being considered on Monday.Collins' plan would restrict gun purchases to a narrow group of suspects, including those on a ""no-fly"" list or a ""selectee"" list of people who require additional screening at airports..But Democratic aides said people credibly suspected of involvement in terrorism would not be covered by the weapons ban under Collins' bill, and a Republican aide indicated it would not do enough to protect the constitutional rights of gun buyers.Even if the Senate approved a gun compromise, it would also have to be passed by the more conservative, Republican-majority House of Representatives. House Republican leadership aides did not comment on the possibility that any bills proposing gun restrictions would be considered on the House floor this week.On Monday, all four of the measures to expand background checks on gun buyers and curb gun sales to those on terrorism watch lists - two put forth by Democrats and two by Republicans - fell short of the 60 votes needed for passage in the 100-member chamber.Gun-control advocates expressed disappointment after the vote and vowed to take revenge on lawmakers at the ballot box in November.""Shame on every single senator who voted against these life-saving amendments and protected the rights of terrorists and other dangerous people to buy guns,"" said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. ""The Brady Campaign will expose these politicians for who they really are and call out their failure to disarm hate in America.""

By Emily Flitter and Emily Stephenson
| NEW YORK/WASHINGTON

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON Donald Trump fired Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager who helped him win Republican presidential nominating contests but clashed with other advisers on how to appeal to the broader general electorate, several people with knowledge of the decision said on Monday.The firing on Monday morning was another shakeup for a campaign already at odds with many senior Republican figures over the presumptive nominee's policies, with the party's nominating convention in Cleveland less than a month away. But it may also prove a step toward calming concerns among party leaders about Trump, a wealthy businessman and political outsider, and the conflicting advice he was getting from senior aides, as he battles presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton ahead of the Nov. 8 election.Trump said Lewandowski did ""a great job"" but ""it's time now for a different kind of a campaign.""""We ran a small, beautiful, well-unified campaign. It worked very well in the primaries. I think I'm probably going to do some of that,"" Trump said in an interview with Fox News, in which he did not say if Lewandowski had been fired.Three people close to the campaign said some of Trump's staff viewed Lewandowski as opposing strategic changes and staff hires urged for the general election campaign by Paul Manafort, a strategist hired in April partly for his experience on presidential campaigns that Lewandowski lacked.The three, a campaign staffer and two people in regular contact with Trump advisers, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized by Trump to discuss the firing.Manafort will take over as campaign manager, said Carl Paladino, co-chairman of the campaign's operations in New York state.""Paul's in charge,"" Sean Spicer, the Republican National Committee's communications director, said in an interview.Trump's decision to fire his manager came in part at the urging of his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, who have powerful advisory roles in the campaign, the two people in contact with Trump aides said. 
Hope Hicks, who single-handedly fields Trump's media inquiries, disputed reports she had complained about Lewandowski to Ivanka Trump. ""That is entirely untrue,"" she said.Lewandowski, 42, had been a near-constant presence at Trump's side since the New York developer launched his campaign on June 2015. In a brief statement read on CNN, Lewandowski said: ""I stand by the fact that Mr. Trump is a great candidate and is better than Hillary Clinton ever will be."" Lewandowski denied there were any tensions between him and Trump's family in an interview with CNN.Later on Monday, a campaign adviser resigned after reveling in Lewandowski's exit on his Twitter account, CNN reported.
""Ding dong the witch is dead!"" Michael Caputo, the adviser, wrote shortly after reports of the firing emerged. He later released a statement to CNN saying he had resigned. ""In hindsight, that was too exuberant a reaction to this personnel move,"" his statement said.CAMPAIGN TENSIONS
The RNC spokesman did not think there would be a change in Trump's tone. ""It's going to be more of a streamlined effort and more of an understanding of the difference that a general election has,"" Spicer said.Clinton's campaign has hundreds more staff than that of Trump. In contrast to her unsuccessful 2008 presidential bid, there has been no public sign this time of any significant infighting among her advisers.
The former U.S. secretary of state has also spent millions of dollars on television commercials in recent weeks. Trump has not aired any paid advertisements since becoming the presumptive nominee, preferring to spread his message through his Twitter account and in media interviews.Trump has faced setbacks in the past two weeks. His renewed calls to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States have drawn heavy criticism from Republican politicians in Washington and prompted corporate sponsors like Apple and JPMorgan Chase to withhold funding from the party's July 18-21 convention. Recent opinion polls show at least half of all voters approve of the Muslim ban.Lewandowski, a former New Hampshire field director for a conservative advocacy group, argued that Trump's unconventional campaigning style did not need to be changed after it proved successful in the last few months of primary contests.Lewandowski repeatedly defended that strategy with a line that became his mantra: ""Let Trump be Trump."" Known for his brusque manner, Lewandowski was accused of manhandling a female reporter in Florida during the primary campaign, but the battery charge against him was later dropped.He is still scheduled to attend the Cleveland convention as chairman of New Hampshire's delegation.The Democratic National Committee said Lewandowski's exit was unlikely to change Trump.""It wasn't Corey Lewandowski who called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States,"" Mark Paustenbach, a party spokesman, said in a statement, ""it was Donald Trump.""

A man arrested over the weekend trying to wrestle a gun from a police officer at a Las Vegas rally held by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told an investigator he wanted to kill the candidate, court papers showed on Monday.Michael Steven Sandford, who prosecutors described as a 19-year-old British national, was arrested on Saturday at the Treasure Island hotel in Las Vegas after trying to disarm the officer, according to Las Vegas police.According to court papers filed on Monday in federal court in Nevada, Sandford told a Secret Service agent he had driven to Las Vegas from California with the goal of shooting Trump.""Sandford claimed he had been attempting to kill Trump for about a year but decided to act on this occasion because he finally felt confident about trying it,"" the court papers said.
He was charged with committing an act of violence on restricted ground, Natalie Collins, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office, said in an email.Sandford has not entered a plea and is scheduled to be in court for a preliminary hearing on July 5, Collins said. Sandford's federal public defender, Heather Fraley, could not be immediately reached for comment.
Sandford said he had been in the United States for a year and a half, the documents showed. The records said he had lived in Hoboken, New Jersey, after coming to the country.Court records said Sandford went to the Battlefield Vegas gun range last Friday to practice shooting, adding that he had never fired a gun before. While there, he fired 20 rounds from a Glock 9 mm handgun, the records said.
Sandford told investigators that if he were ""on the street tomorrow,"" he would try again, the documents said. (Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles and Curtis Skinner in San Francisco; Editing by Toni Reinhold and Peter Cooney)"

By Luciana Lopez
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Hillary Clinton has no shortage of economic advisors. Scores of world-class experts pour ideas into her campaign on the policies she should champion in her bid for the White House.But before much of the input reaches the Democratic candidate, it is filtered through a pair of staffers known inside the campaign as the ""Economikes.""Working out of Clinton's campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, Michael Shapiro and Michael Schmidt are helping shape what could be a lasting economic agenda if the former secretary of state overcomes Republican rival Donald Trump in November's election.In an interview with Reuters, Shapiro and Schmidt described Clinton's process for forming policy by broadly soliciting ideas and crafting them into the action points that she takes to voters. Before Clinton takes a position, Shapiro said, ""she wants to know we have talked to and gotten input from everyone, making sure that we're consulting with labor, making sure that we're consulting with experts.""Clinton's inclusive approach to developing policy positions has been faulted for being slow and unwieldy. Much of the work of sifting through the wealth of sometimes disparate ideas and data it yields falls to the Economikes.Both are recent graduates of Yale Law School. Prior to joining the campaign, Schmidt, 30, worked at the U.S. Treasury Department and the Yale Investments Office, helping manage the university's endowment.Shapiro, 29, worked at the White House for the National Economic Council. Earlier this year, he married the daughter of New York Senator Chuck Schumer.The pair helps Clinton draw upon a deep bench of advisers, including economist Alan Krueger, Duke professor Aaron Chatterji and Simon Johnson, a former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, along with scores of other academics and business people. 
Some communicate regularly through emails, conference calls, meetings and memos. Others are tapped once or twice for specific expertise. Frequent contributor Alan Blinder, the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, said he will ""usually email the Mikes"" with ideas.The fruit of the process will be on display today in Ohio, where Clinton is expected to give a speech contrasting her economic vision with that of Trump, a businessman who often names himself as his main adviser and is known for his off-the-cuff style.Clinton has called raising middle class incomes the defining economic challenge of the time. So far, she has presented a mix of goals, including making child care more affordable and boosting jobs. Some business leaders have said her approach is reassuring, but progressives have criticized her policies as too moderate.Trump, in contrast, often has taken business leaders by surprise with his policy proposals. He has promised to renegotiate international trade deals to pump up U.S. manufacturing, vowed to penalize companies that move their headquarters abroad to avoid taxes, and pledged to dismantle Obama's financial regulation reforms.
   ""ONE OF THE MIKES""
   While the ""Economikes"" nickname began as a joke, Shapiro said the campaign's digital team made it stick by using it in a Q&A posted on Clinton's web site.Their bosses, senior policy advisers Jake Sullivan and Maya Harris, have been known to stick their heads out of their offices and ask for ""one of the Mikes.""On email chains, CC: notes will sometimes include ""plus the Economikes.""
Humor aside, their work often is serious business.After the tainted water crisis hit national headlines in January, Clinton dispatched Schmidt and her political director, Amanda Renteria, to Flint, Michigan to investigate. Schmidt said the effort informed Clinton's approach to the water crisis during the Democratic debate in Flint, including her call for the governor to resign.    In other cases, they said, Clinton will ask the pair to research issues she's heard on the campaign trail, such as the case of an Iowa bowling alley owner who told the candidate student debt made it hard for him to get business loans.The campaign since has rolled out proposals to allow for refinancing of student debt and the use of income-based repayment programs to cut monthly payments.Shapiro and Schmidt said the policy points they bring back to Clinton typically lead her to ask more questions, a process that can go on for several rounds before the candidate finally settles on a policy proposal.

By Dustin Volz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell set up a vote late on Monday to expand the Federal Bureau of Investigation's authority to use a secretive surveillance order without a warrant to include email metadata and some browsing history information.The move, made via an amendment to a criminal justice appropriations bill, is an effort by Senate Republicans to respond to last week's mass shooting in an Orlando nightclub after a series of measures to restrict guns offered by both parties failed on Monday.""In the wake of the tragic massacre in Orlando, it is important our law enforcement have the tools they need to conduct counterterrorism investigations,"" Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican and sponsor of the amendment, said in a statement. The bill is also supported by Republican Senators John Cornyn, Jeff Sessions and Richard Burr, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee.Privacy advocates denounced the effort, saying it seeks to exploit a mass shooting in order to expand the government's digital spying powers.
Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, criticized a similar effort last month as one that ""takes a hatchet to important protections for Americans' liberty.""The amendment would broaden the FBI's authority to use so-called National Security Letters to include electronic communications transaction records such as time stamps of emails and the emails' senders and recipients.
The Obama administration for years has lobbied for a change to how NSLs can be used, after a 2008 legal memo from the Justice Department said the law limits them largely to phone billing records. FBI Director James Comey has said the change essentially corrects a typo and is a top legislative priority for his agency.NSLs do not require a warrant and are almost always accompanied by a gag order preventing the service provider from sharing the request with a targeted user.The letters have existed since the 1970s, though the scope and frequency of their use expanded greatly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
The amendment filed Monday would also make permanent a provision of the USA Patriot Act that allows the intelligence community to conduct surveillance on ""lone wolf"" suspects who do not have confirmed ties to a foreign terrorist group. That provision, which the Justice Department said last year had never been used, is currently set to expire in December 2019.A vote is expected no later than Wednesday, McConnell's office said.

By Yara Bayoumy
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON About three months ago, Sarah Ibrahim's son came home from his fourth-grade class at a Maryland school with a disturbing question.""Will I have time to say goodbye to you before you're deported?"" he said, according to Ibrahim, a Muslim Arab American who works at a federal government agency in Maryland.""The kids in his classroom were saying: 'Who's going to leave when Trump becomes president?'"" said the 35-year-old mother.The incident happened a few months after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump -- now the presumptive nominee -- first called for a ban on Muslim immigrants and for more scrutiny at mosques after 14 people were killed in San Bernardino by a Muslim couple whom the FBI said had been radicalized.Trump intensified his anti-Muslim rhetoric after last week's mass shooting in Orlando, in which a U.S.-born Muslim man killed 49 people at a gay nightclub, calling for a suspension of immigration from countries with ""a proven history of terrorism"".He reiterated his call for more surveillance of mosques and warned that radical Muslims were ""trying to take over our children."" While Democratic and several Republican leaders have distanced themselves from Trump's comments, many American Muslims say his stance has fueled an atmosphere in which some may feel they can voice prejudices or attack Muslims without fear of retribution.""What Trump did was make these hidden thoughts public. He gave people permission to speak out loud, he removed the shame associated with being prejudiced. People know that they won't be punished,"" Ibrahim told Reuters at a community iftar, the sundown meal during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.Trump's campaign did not respond to Reuters' request for comment. Trump has rejected the criticism that his rhetoric is racist, and has said he is often misunderstood by the media and his opponents.
A report by the Council on American-Islamic Relations and University of California, Berkeley released on Monday said the number of recorded incidents in which mosques were targeted jumped to 78 in 2015, the most since the body began tracking them in 2009. There were 20 and 22 such incidents in the previous two years, respectively. The incidents include verbal threats and physical attacks.Corey Saylor, CAIR's director of the department to monitor and combat Islamophobia, said there had been a spike in Islamophobic incidents in the wake of Orlando, including those  targeting mosques.""Trump's rhetoric is a direct threat to American principles. He has mainstreamed anti-Constitutional ideas like banning or surveilling people based on faith,"" Saylor told Reuters.""Such divisive rhetoric contributes to a toxic environment in which some people take the law into their own hands and attack people of institutions they perceive as Muslim.""
""DIVIDING THE COUNTRY""
CAIR says the last big spike in incidents targeting mosques was seen in 2010 following the controversy over locating an Islamic center near the site of the Sept. 11 attacks in New York.It said that lent ""additional weight to the argument that levels of anti-Muslim sentiment follow trends in domestic U.S. politics, not international terrorism"".American rabbis and preachers have also denounced Trump's rhetoric. Anti-Semitic incidents in the United States still outstrip those against Muslims. The Anti-Defamation League said last year there were 912 anti-Semitic incidents across the United States during the 2014 calendar year, up 21 percent from 2013.
""If Muslims are not free and safe in America, then Christians and Jews are not free and safe in America,"" said Rabbi Eric Yoffie, president emeritus of the Union for Reform Judaism.Trump has also drawn criticism for his rhetoric against Latino immigrants, saying early in his campaign that Mexican ""rapists"" and other criminals were coming across the border and calling for all undocumented immigrants to be deported.Manal Omar, a Muslim-American author based in Washington, said she has stopped taking the metro and walking alone late at night.""I can't dismiss the tweets and angry messages I've received from right wing militants,"" said Omar, who says she has grown especially vigilant after last week's murder of British lawmaker Jo Cox, whom she knew.A few days after the San Bernardino attack, Ilhaam Hassan's family restaurant was burned down in an arson attack in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Matthew Gust pleaded guilty in May to federal hate-crime and arson charges. He admitted to setting the fire because of the national origin of the employees and customers at the restaurant -- a focal point of the local Somali-American community.""I don't know what to expect if he (Trump) becomes the president,"" Hassan said. ""He is against minorities. He is against Islam. It's not a message of unity, it's a message of dividing the country and that is not what America is based on.""

By Yeganeh Torbati
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama, his vice president and defense secretary took aim on Monday at policies of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump they said would alienate Muslims globally along with U.S. allies and neighbors.In a speech focusing on national security at a think tank in Washington, Vice President Joe Biden said Trump's calls to bar the entry of Muslims and to profile Muslim Americans reflected the politics of fear and intolerance.""There are 1.4 billion Muslims in the world"" Biden said. ""Some of the rhetoric I'm hearing sounds designed to radicalize all 1.4 billion.""   Biden's attacks on Trump as an isolationist, and others by Obama and Defense Secretary Ash Carter represent an unusually early and vigorous assault on an opposing party's presidential nominee. The election is on Nov. 8.Referring to Trump's vow to erect a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico if elected, Biden said that the most complex threats do not respect borders and a wall would destroy much of the progress the Obama administration had made with U.S. neighbors.
""If we build walls and disrespect our neighbors, we will quickly see all this progress evaporating, replaced by a return of anti-Americanism, a corrosive rift throughout our hemisphere,"" Biden said.OBAMA, CARTER JOIN FRAY

Obama, who last week assailed Trump for what he called a ""dangerous"" mindset and ""loose talk and sloppiness"" in defining the country's enemies, on Monday criticized  Trump's anti-trade policies in a speech at a U.S. Commerce Department conference.""This is not just about jobs and trade, it's not just about hard, cold cash. It's also about building relationships across borders,"" Obama told the 2,400 people from 70 countries at the conference to attract foreign investment.Trump has threatened to impose steep tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports and demanded a change in a U.S. trade policy he says allows other countries to shut out U.S imports, devalue their currencies and unfairly target U.S. industries.
Speaking at the same event as Biden, Carter said a critical part of U.S. leadership is its ""longtime network of allies and partners in every corner of the world.""""Our allies around the world have stood with us - and fought with us - time and again, most recently in Iraq, Afghanistan, and against ISIL,"" he said, using an acronym for Islamic State.Carter did not mention Trump, who has called NATO ""obsolete"" and said he would consider letting Japan and South Korea develop their own nuclear weapons rather than relying on the United States for protection against North Korea and China.While Obama, Carter and other top officials generally have refrained from attacking Trump by name, Obama administration spokesmen have not denied that such remarks are directed at the presumptive Republican candidate.
