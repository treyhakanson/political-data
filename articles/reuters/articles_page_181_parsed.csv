By Jonathan Spicer
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK A U.S. congressional watchdog said on Tuesday it has formally added three agencies to its investigation into whether government regulators are too soft on the banks they are meant to police.In March, Reuters exclusively reported that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) was preparing a probe of the U.S. Federal Reserve and other to-be-determined regulators, in response to a request by Democratic U.S. Representatives Maxine Waters and Al Green for it to look into ""regulatory capture."" The review, requested last October, is the first by an outside agency into the perception that financial regulators are ""captured"" by and too deferential toward the bankers they supervise, so that Wall Street benefits at the public's expense.
Lawrance Evans, director of the GAO's financial markets and community investment division, said in an email on Tuesday that the probe would include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). The GAO will also look back at work by the Office of Thrift Supervision, which merged with the OCC in 2011, and regulates savings and loan institutions. Evans said the investigation is technically separate from the probe of the Fed, ""but it is indeed part of the work we are doing in response to the Waters/Green request."" 
The FDIC declined to comment. Representatives from the OCC and NCUA were not immediately available to comment. 
Perceptions of regulatory capture have dogged the U.S. central bank and other regulators since they failed to head off the 2007-2009 financial crisis that sparked a global recession. (Reporting by Jonathan Spicer; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"	['Waters', 'Evans']	[]

Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Tuesday laid out a technology and innovation agenda ranging from connecting every U.S. household to high-speed internet by 2020 to beefing up cyber security and reducing regulatory barriers.A statement issued by her campaign said Clinton strongly supports the Obama administration's net neutrality rules requiring broadband providers to treat all data equally, rather than giving or selling access to a so-called Web fast lane.She will increase research and development budgets of the National Science Foundation and similar entities and will launch an initiative to train up to 50,000 computer science teachers, the statement said.
""Hillary believes the government has an important role to play in laying a foundation for broad-based innovation and economic growth - by reducing regulatory barriers to entry, promoting healthy competition, and keeping the internet free and open,"" it said.

WASHINGTON White House spokesman Josh Earnest, on Tuesday, chided Republicans for failing to push forward with the president's request for funding to combat the Zika virus and address an urgent public health crisis. ""They need that money right now,"" Earnest told reporters at a daily briefing, referring to U.S. agencies that he said are on the frontlines of battling the virus, especially in the U.S. South. Senate Democrats earlier on Tuesday blocked a Republican funding proposal that they said was inadequate.

By Patricia Zengerle and Yara Bayoumy
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama's special envoy for the fight against Islamic State said on Tuesday that coalition forces were making progress and planning assaults on key cities in Iraq and Syria, but U.S. lawmakers criticized the progress as too slow.Brett McGurk testified at a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations hearing that morale is falling within the militant group as it loses territory. But he said efforts to find a political solution were making little progress and could not predict an end to fighting as long as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad remained in power.""So long as Assad is leading the government in Damascus there is no way this war will ever end,"" McGurk said. The conflict between U.S.-backed armed groups and Assad's government, supported by Russia and Iran, has complicated the fight against Islamic State amid a massive humanitarian crisis.Iraqi forces recently entered the Islamic State bastion of Falluja just west of Baghdad, and were pushing north toward Mosul, by far the biggest city that Islamic State controls.In Syria, U.S.-backed forces were closing in on the militant stronghold of Manbij, and Assad's Russian-backed army has advanced into the province surrounding the de facto Islamic State capital Raqqa.
McGurk said completion of the operation against Manbij would create conditions to move on Raqqa. And he said planning was under way for a campaign to liberate Mosul.""We're beginning to totally isolate their presence in Raqqa and Mosul and I believe we are setting the conditions in place to get them out of both of these cities,"" McGurk said.He offered no timeline for those operations.
Lawmakers said they felt the campaign was moving too slowly, and worried that, without a political solution, defeating Islamic State would leave behind a power vacuum that could be filled by another militant group.""I don't see how what's left of the political process possibly leads to Assad's departure,"" said Republican Senator Bob Corker, the committee's chairman.A massacre two weeks ago in Florida by a gunman inspired by Islamic State drew attention to its efforts to inspire attacks in the west.  
McGurk said Raqqa was the center for the group's social media operations, which have become more of a focus as its fortunes have faded on the battlefield.Discussing the region, McGurk said Washington would like more air resources from coalition allies United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.""Right now we want to end the war in Yemen in order to really focus efforts on the counter-ISIL campaign,"" McGurk said, using an acronym for Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS.

By Susan Cornwell
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. lawmakers deadlocked over funding to fight the Zika virus on Tuesday, as Senate Democrats blocked a Republican proposal they said fell short of the challenge posed by the mosquito-borne virus and hurt other health priorities.Amid political recriminations by both parties, the Republican plan to provide $1.1 billion in funding to combat Zika, which had already passed the House of Representatives, failed to get the 60 votes needed in the Senate to clear a procedural hurdle. The vote was 52 in favor and 48 against on a mostly party-line vote. It was unclear when Congress would revisit the issue. Democrats urged bipartisan talks, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said lawmakers would address the matter again sometime after the July 4 national holiday next week.Both sides warned the other that there could be a political price to pay in an election year for stalling on Zika funding, with the summer mosquito season under way and with it the threat of the virus spreading.""Here we are, in an utterly absurd position, playing political games as this public health crisis mounts here in our country,"" McConnell said.The Zika virus, which has swept through the Americas and Caribbean since last fall, has been linked to thousands of cases of microcephaly, a rare birth defect, in Brazil, as well as to neurological disorders. It has been declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization.There have not yet been any cases reported of local transmission of the Zika virus in the continental United States, but there have been 820 cases that were acquired from travel to areas with active Zika outbreaks, or through sexual transmission. There have been more than 1,800 cases of Zika infection reported in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory in the Caribbean.
Health experts expect local transmission to occur in the continental United States with warmer weather.Democrats have been urging Republicans for months to agree to Zika funding. The Republican plan would have funded mosquito control efforts by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, as well as vaccine research by the National Institutes of Health, and money for community health centers in areas that are experiencing the highest rates of Zika transmission.But Democrats complained that Republicans locked them out of drafting the $1.1 billion funding plan, which would have made $750 million in budget cuts elsewhere. The Republican plan, rushed through the House last week, would have taken money from battling the Ebola virus as well as from funds set aside for implementing the Obamacare health insurance program in U.S. territories.The Senate last month agreed to a bipartisan bill allocating the same amount - $1.1 billion - to fight Zika, but without cutting any other programs.
DISPUTE OVER PLANNED PARENTHOOD
Democrats were especially angry that the Republican proposal that failed on Tuesday would not allow funding to go to private entities such as the women's healthcare provider Planned Parenthood, although the Zika virus can be sexually transmitted.""I don't know what universe (McConnell) is living in. What does he think, we're all stupid, the American people are dumb? They're not. They understand what's going here,"" Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid declared after the vote.
President Barack Obama, a Democrat, had vowed to veto the plan, which falls short of his $1.9 billion request, if it ever arrived on his desk.Republicans charged that the Democrats were blocking the measure mainly because it included no funding for Planned Parenthood, a non-profit group that Democrats and Republicans have been skirmishing over for years. It provides health exams, screening and contraception services to women.Republicans have previously sought to cut off all federal funding to the group, which also provides abortions. Planned Parenthood says abortions make up just three percent of its work.Republican Senator John Thune, referring to Planned Parenthood, charged on Monday that Democrats were more interested in pleasing a what he called a special interest group than in acting on Zika.U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. The WHO has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults.

WASHINGTON Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, called on Tuesday for Washington, in parallel with its negotiations with Europe, to pursue a separate free trade agreement with Britain, once it has formally separated from the European Union.Ryan, the highest-ranking elected Republican in the United States, echoed a call from many members of his party, who have dismissed President Barack Obama's contention that Britain will be at the ""back of the queue"" for trade talks. Obama issued that warning in April when he intervened to try to persuade Britons to vote to remain in the June 23 referendum on staying or leaving the EU.  Free trade agreements require the approval of both houses of the U.S. Congress. Ryan's Republicans currently control a majority in both the House and Senate. EU and U.S. negotiations had sought to conclude the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) talks before Obama leaves office in January. Although many of his fellow Democrats oppose trade deals as a potential threat to U.S. jobs, Obama has worked with Republicans to pass trade measures.
""That is something we should begin discussions with Great Britain to ease concerns so that we do have a smooth trade relationship with Great Britain because they are our indispensable ally,"" Ryan said on WISN, a radio station in his home state Wisconsin.
The remarks were distributed by Ryan's office in Washington.Some trade experts have said that a deal on TTIP is unlikely for years now without Britain at the table, which could open an opportunity for a separate deal with Britain.

8	8	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-obama-idUSKCN0ZD32S	For Obama, setbacks from a divided Supreme Court	"


By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court breaks for the summer this week, having dealt high-profile setbacks to President Barack Obama on issues important to his liberal legacy, notably on immigration and climate change.This will be the high court's last full nine-month term of the Democratic president's administration. Obama leaves office in January 2017.The court was one shy of its full strength nine members much of this term due to the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia on Feb. 13. His absence affected the outcome of some major cases. Four cases, including the immigration dispute, ended in 4-4 splits that left lower court rulings in place.There was little Obama could do about it. Even if the Republican-led U.S. Senate had accepted Obama's March 16 nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to succeed Scalia, it was unlikely he would have made it to the bench in time to hear the term's final round of arguments in April.Hoping their candidate wins the presidential election in November, Republicans insist the choice of Scalia's successor should fall to the next president.The administration did score some major wins on abortion and  other social issues, but these were when it intervened in cases where it was not directly involved.IMMIGRATION LOSS

Obama's biggest loss came last Thursday on his bid to protect up to four million immigrants from deportation. The 4-4 deadlock will keep him from taking major action on immigration reform, a top policy aim, before he leaves office.In a second major blow to Obama's legacy, the court unexpectedly put on hold sweeping federal regulations meant to curb carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, the centerpiece of his administration's climate change strategy..That decision by a 5-4 vote, days before Scalia's death, effectively put off a ruling on the regulation until after a legal challenge is completed - sometime after the next president enters the White House - and prevented the new regulations from being implemented.On healthcare, the administration lost narrowly to Christian groups that sought an exemption to a provision of his signature law known as Obamacare requiring employers to provide health insurance coverage for contraception. The high court sent that dispute back to lower courts without deciding the main legal issue, throwing out a series of rulings in the government's favor.
The administration lost some other big cases in which it was directly involved, including former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell's successful appeal of his corruption convictions.FRIEND OF THE COURT
A silver lining for the administration came in cases where it lent its support, as a friend of the court, to advocates for abortion rights and for race-based university admissions to offset years of discrimination.
Elizabeth Wydra, president of the liberal leaning Constitutional Accountability Center, said Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, the administration's top Supreme Court lawyer until he stepped down last week, deserved some credit for the ruling on Monday striking down tough abortion restrictions in Texas due to his performance during the oral argument.Last Thursday, the court upheld consideration of race as an acceptable factor in admissions at the University of Texas. Had Scalia lived, the court might have deadlocked 4-4 in that too.One 4-4 decision went the administration's way. The government supported unions that successfully fended off a conservative legal challenge. The divided court left in place a lower court ruling in favor of the unions.With Scalia on the court, the conservative majority would likely have struck down fees that many states force workers to pay unions in lieu of dues to fund collective bargaining and other activities. A loss for unions would have deprived unions representing teachers, police, transit workers, firefighters and other government employees of millions of dollars annually and diminished their political clout.The administration also scored a significant victory when the court upheld an electricity-markets regulation that encourages big power users like factories to cut consumption at peak times, rejecting a challenge brought by electric utilities.

9	9	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-abortion-idUSKCN0ZC0JL	Supreme Court firmly backs abortion rights, tosses Texas law	"


By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday struck down a Texas abortion law imposing strict regulations on doctors and facilities in the strongest endorsement of abortion rights in America in more than two decades.The 5-3 ruling held that the Republican-backed 2013 Texas law placed an undue burden on women exercising their right under the U.S. Constitution to end a pregnancy, established in the court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.The abortion providers who challenged the law said it was medically unnecessary and specifically intended to shut clinics. Texas officials said it was intended to protect women's health. The ruling means similar laws in other states are probably unconstitutional and could put in jeopardy other types of abortion restrictions enacted in various conservative states.""The decision should send a loud signal to politicians that they can no longer hide behind sham rationales to shut down clinics and prevent a woman who has decided to end a pregnancy from getting the care she needs,"" said Jennifer Dalven, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union.President Barack Obama, whose administration backed the abortion providers in the court challenge, said in a statement he was ""pleased to see the Supreme Court protect women's rights and health"" and that restrictions like those in Texas ""harm women's health and place an unconstitutional obstacle in the path of a woman's reproductive freedom.""Conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy joined the court's four liberal members in the ruling, with the remaining three conservatives dissenting. The court declared that both key provisions of the law - requiring abortion doctors to have  difficult-to-obtain ""admitting privileges"" at a local hospital and requiring clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities - violated a woman's right to an abortion.Writing for the court, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said, ""We conclude that neither of these provisions offers medical benefits sufficient to justify the burdens upon access that each imposes.""""Each places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a pre-viability abortion, each constitutes an undue burden on abortion access, and each violates the federal Constitution,"" Breyer added.Deferring to state legislatures over ""questions of medical uncertainty is also inconsistent with this court's case law,"" Breyer added.
The ruling in the case, Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, represented the most vigorous affirmation of abortion rights in the United States since a 1992 ruling affirmed a woman's right to have the procedure.On a warm sunny summer day, hundreds of people on both sides of the issue converged on the Supreme Court building, with abortion rights advocates dancing and celebrating after the ruling. ""We're ecstatic. The reality is today women won,"" abortion rights activist Marcela Howell said.The law was passed by a Republican-led legislature and signed by a Republican governor in 2013. Ten states currently have admitting privileges requirements on the books while six have laws requiring hospital-grade facilities. Lower courts have blocked admitting privileges provisions in five states and halted facilities regulations in two states. ""The decision erodes states' lawmaking authority to safeguard the health and safety of women and subjects more innocent life to being lost. Texas' goal is to protect innocent life, while ensuring the highest health and safety standards for women,"" Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott said.Since the law was passed, the number of abortion clinics in Texas, the second-most-populous U.S. state with about 27 million people, had dropped from 41 to 19.The Supreme Court has appeals pending in two cases involving admitting privilege laws in Mississippi and Wisconsin on which it could act as soon as Tuesday.
    The Texas law required abortion doctors to have ""admitting privileges,"" a type of formal affiliation, at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the clinic so they can treat patients needing surgery or other critical care.The law also required clinic buildings to possess costly, hospital-grade facilities. These regulations covered numerous building features such as corridor width, the swinging motion of doors, floor tiles, parking spaces, elevator size, ventilation, electrical wiring, plumbing, floor tiling and even the angle that water flows from drinking fountains.PUBLIC OPINION SPLIT
Americans remain closely divided over whether abortion should be legal. In a Reuters/Ipsos online poll involving 6,769 U.S. adults conducted from June 3 to June 22, 47 percent of respondents said abortion generally should be legal and 42 percent said it generally should be illegal.
Views on abortion in the United States have changed very little over the decades, according to historical polling data.The last time the justices decided a major abortion case was nine years ago when they ruled 5-4 to uphold a federal law banning a late-term abortion procedure.Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder and CEO of Whole Woman's Health, which led the challenge to the Texas law, said, ""Every day Whole Woman's Health treats our patients with compassion, respect and dignity - and today the Supreme Court did the same. We're thrilled that today justice was served and our clinics stay open.""Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Twitter called the ruling ""a victory for women in Texas and across America.""""This fight isn't over: The next president has to protect women's health. Women won't be 'punished' for exercising their basic rights,"" she said, a dig at presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who once suggested women who get illegal abortions should face ""some sort of punishment."" The presidential election is Nov. 8.Some U.S. states have pursued a variety of restrictions on abortion, including banning certain types of procedures, prohibiting it after a certain number of weeks of gestation, requiring parental permission for girls until a certain age, imposing waiting periods or mandatory counseling, and others.""It's exceedingly unfortunate that the court has taken the ability to protect women's health out of the hands of Texas citizens and their duly-elected representatives,"" Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in a statement.Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito dissented. The normally nine-justice court was one member short after the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who consistently opposed abortion in past rulings.
