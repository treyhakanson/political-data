By Jon Herskovitz and Heide Brandes

Oklahoma's Republican Governor Mary Fallin vetoed a bill calling for prison terms of up the three years for doctors who performed abortions, saying the legislation would not withstand a criminal constitutional legal challenge, her office said on Friday.The bill, which was approved a day earlier in the Republican-dominated legislature, would have made performing an abortion a felony. It also called for revoking the license of any doctor who conducted one.The bill allowed an exemption for an abortion necessary to save the life of the mother.""The bill is so ambiguous and so vague that doctors cannot be certain what medical circumstances would be considered 'necessary to preserve the life of the mother,'"" Fallin said, in a statement from her office, where she was described as ""the most pro-life governor in the nation.""Abortion rights groups had promised a bruising legal battle if the bill were signed into law, which would have resulted in an expensive legal battle. 
Cash-strapped Oklahoma is battling a $1.3 billion budget hole that has caused it to cut education funding and other state programs.Had the bill been approved, the state would have been the first to use its codes of professional conduct to implement a measure that would effectively serve as an abortion ban, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which backs abortion rights but whose data is used by both sides of the debate.
Other states that have tried to impose outright abortion bans after the Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision have seen their laws struck down by courts, it said.Supporters have said the bill could withstand a legal challenge because the state was within its rights to set licensing requirement for doctors.Legal experts have said the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that abortion is legal in the United States and Oklahoma must abide by the court's decision.
Since Fallin took office in 2011, Oklahoma has been one of the leaders in adding restrictions to abortions.""Governor Fallin did the right thing today in vetoing this utterly unconstitutional and dangerous bill,"" said Nancy Northup, president and chief executive officer of the Center for Reproductive Rights, an abortion rights group.

WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama will meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington next month to discuss security and other issues and the Indian leader will be granted the rare honor of addressing both houses of Congress.The White House said Obama and Modi will discuss economic growth, climate change, clean energy, and security and defense cooperation during their June 7 meeting. It will be Modi's fourth trip to the United States since he became prime minister in 2014.   ""The visit will highlight the deepening of the U.S.-India relationship in key areas,"" the White House said in a statement on Friday. The two countries' partnership is seen as critical in Washington, which is seeking to counterbalance China's increasing power. Modi will address a joint meeting of the U.S. Congress, an opportunity extended to few foreign leaders, the day after the White House meeting, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a tweet.
The invitation is a sharp turnaround for Modi, who was once barred from the United States over massacres of Muslims. Last  year there were only two joint addresses to Congress - by Pope Francis and by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, another important U.S. ally in Asia.In 2005, then-U.S. President George W. Bush's administration denied Modi a visa, citing a 1998 U.S. law barring entry to foreigners who have committed ""particularly severe violations of religious freedom.""More than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed in sectarian riots in Gujarat in 2002 when Modi had just become the state's chief minister. Modi has denied any wrongdoing, and India's Supreme Court in 2010 ruled there was no case.
Obama, who has adopted a ""pivot to Asia"" strategy and is keen to encourage a greater Indian military role in East Asia, quickly dismissed the issue by inviting Modi to the White House as soon as he called to congratulate him on winning the 2014 election.The United States is also keen to encourage greater business and trade with India.
Progress has been only gradual, but in late March, the chief executive of U.S. nuclear reactor maker Westinghouse Electric said he expected to sign a deal in June to build six  reactors in India after marathon negotiations that began more than a decade ago.The deal would be the first nuclear commercial power project since the United States and India agreed in 2008 to cooperate in the civil nuclear arena.

WASHINGTON The National Rifle Association endorsed Republican Donald Trump for U.S. president on Friday and he responded by promising to serve the country's top gun lobby group well. Trump, his party's presumptive nominee for the Nov. 8  presidential election, praised the NRA and took a swipe at Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, saying she wants to abolish the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment, which guarantees the right to bear arms.The billionaire businessman has opposed gun-free zones and promised to protect Americans' rights to self-defense.
""I will not let you down,"" Trump told the gathering in Louisville, Kentucky.

By Simon Cameron-Moore
| SINGAPORE

SINGAPORE Donald Trump's ""isolationist"" foreign policy pronouncements are feeding insecurity in some Asian nations fearful of China's growing power, and risk emboldening nationalists and authoritarians in the region.The real estate developer, who is very close to securing the Republican nomination for November's presidential election, has with undiplomatic abandon challenged much of the status quo in U.S.-Asia relations. Overall, his comments have sounded like a death knell for the ""pivot to Asia"" strategy adopted by President Barack Obama five years ago.Trump has said U.S. allies like Japan and South Korea should pay more toward their defense, warned he could withdraw U.S. troops from bases in Japan, and mulled whether Japan and South Korea should have their own nuclear arms. This week he told Reuters he is willing to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which would represent a major shift in U.S. policy. In a television interview on Friday, Trump told MSNBC that while he was open to talks, he ""would never go to North Korea."" Trump has also threatened to rein in China's big trade surplus with the United States, saying he will threaten to impose heavy duties on Chinese goods. And Trump says he will rip up and then renegotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact agreed to by the U.S., Japan, and 10 other countries in February. Furthermore, Trump's call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States risks undermining moderate leaders in Muslim countries like Pakistan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Bangladesh.""If he becomes president and adopts his own version of foreign policy, the U.S. will cease to be a Pacific power. That's the end result,"" said Kunihiko Miyake, a former Japanese diplomat, who served in both Beijing and Baghdad. ""It's not that we would adopt 'Japan First,' but if the U.S. leaves, there will be a vacuum and ... China will try to fill it,"" said Miyake, research director at the Canon Institute for Global Studies. ""It's a survival issue for all allies of the United States.""Trump could, of course, lose the election to the likely Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, who is well known by many Asia policymakers. And if he is elected he could act much differently in office. But Asian diplomats and policy advisers say that initial impressions count.Trump's idea of making Japan and South Korea pay up rather than enjoy a cheaper ride under the U.S. security umbrella sent shudders through Tokyo and Seoul. Trump reiterated his stance on Friday. ""They have a lot of money, both of those nations,"" he told MSNBC, pointing to Japan's auto sales and South Korea's electronics industry. ""We have to get reimbursed."" In addition, his comments about the possibility of a local nuclear deterrent fanned fears among Asian diplomats that the world could become an even more dangerous place. 
""It is here that Trump is most scary,"" Lalit Mansingh, a former Indian ambassador to Washington, told Reuters in New Delhi, though he also noted it may be ""just election rhetoric..Japan's nationalist-led government has already boosted defence spending and has reinterpreted its pacifist constitution to allow its military to come to the aid of allies under attack even if Japan itself if not attacked, a major shift in Japan's post-war security stance.""His position is causing anxiety, especially in East Asia,"" said a senior lawmaker in Japan's ruling coalition. ""It is really hard to comprehend because conservatives have supported a stronger military presence and more engagement.""FLASHPOINT
Mansingh said he expects China to test the foreign policy resolve of whoever occupies the White House next, and the South China Sea looms as one of the most likely flashpoints.Tensions over China's land-building and installations on islets in the disputed waters flared on Tuesday, when two Chinese warplanes carried out what the Pentagon called an ""unsafe"" intercept of a U.S. military reconnaissance aircraft.
""They're building a massive fortress in the South China Sea. They're not supposed to be doing that,"" Trump told Reuters, without saying what he would do about it.At least, according to Mansingh, China's leaders and Trump shared the mentality of dealmakers, which could help settle diplomatic wrangles before they get out of hand.Jia Qingguo, an adviser to China's government on foreign affairs, said Trump sounds like an ""isolationist"" who doesn't want the United States to become too active internationally.""So, he doesn't sound that aggressive,"" said Jia, the dean of the School of International Relations at China's elite Peking University. ""Chinese tend to think that too much so-called internationalism on the part of the U.S. is not that good.""A senior Japanese government official said Washington could lose influence in Asia if there was any perception it was softening its stance on issues like the South China Sea.""And it would be very difficult to get it back,"" he warned.Mansingh says those fears are overblown as the United States' self-interest lay in protecting access to the Pacific and Indian Oceans. 
""What would American withdrawal mean? Does it want to hand over the affairs of the world to China? Would that serve anybody's interest? I don't think so.""DEALBREAKER
There are also fears that the TPP could unravel, or become worth a lot less to Asian partners, should Trump renegotiate the pact, as he has said he wants to do.The deal has yet to be ratified by the U.S. Congress, but Obama has warned that delay could allow China to steal a march through its own proposed regional trade deal with 15 other nations.     ""I think it's hard to imagine that TPP would survive a Trump presidency,"" said a top trade official in a major country in the region, who declined to be more closely identified.""'Less intervention' would be a small benefit compared to the massive damage to the world from a USA that becomes more isolationist and more crassly commercial under Trump,"" he said. The lack of priority Trump appears to give to issues that don't serve his ""America first"" agenda could mean he'll soft-pedal on human rights and democratic values, some critics said. That would come at a time when generals are running Thailand, a 'strong man' has just been elected as president of the Philippines, and Malaysia's prime minister has silenced independent media.""Let's hope that someone on his team realizes that respect for human rights must be a core U.S. foreign policy value and not just a reality show line,"" said Phil Robertson, deputy director for Human Rights Watch's Asia division.On the other hand, Panitan Wattanayagorn, an adviser to Thailand's defence minister, Prawit Wongsuwon, expressed confidence that Trump wouldn't apply pressure to countries like his.""All in all, if Trump arrives, the chances of stronger ties will be good because he would want allies,"" said Panitan.

By Michael Holden and Susan Heavey

LONDON/WASHINGTON - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Friday that British Prime Minister David Cameron had asked him to visit, but a UK spokesman said no invitation had been extended.The apparent crossed signals were the latest sign of tension between the presumptive Republican Party nominee and the leader of a major U.S. ally, who has criticized Trump's call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States.Trump, in a morning interview with MSNBC, said Cameron extended the invitation to visit 10 Downing Street two days ago and that he ""might do it."" He gave no other details.A spokesman for Cameron's office said it was a longstanding practice for the prime minister to meet with the Republican and Democrat presidential nominees if they visited Britain. ""Given the parties have yet to choose their nominees, there are no confirmed dates for this,"" the spokesman said.
However, a Downing Street source said a formal invite would not be sent out to presidential candidates.       Trump's comments followed a transatlantic exchange between the two men over Cameron's criticism. In December, Cameron called Trump ""divisive, stupid and wrong"" and suggested Trump would unite Britain against him if he visited the United Kingdom. 
After Trump clinched his party's nomination this month, Cameron acknowledged the achievement but said he stood by his earlier comments and would not apologize. Trump fired back this week, saying on Monday that he was likely not to have a good relationship with Cameron.    But the next day he said he expected to have ""a good relationship"" and on Friday Trump said Cameron had invited him to London.
""I will do just fine with David Cameron. I think he's a nice guy. I will do just fine,"" Trump told MSNBC. ""But they have asked me to visit 10 Downing Street - and I might do it.""Cameron has said he will work with the winner of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election and is committed to maintaining the special U.S.-UK relationship, his spokesman has said.Trump's proposed ban also drew criticism from Sadiq Khan, who was elected mayor of London this month and is the first Muslim to hold the post. Khan said last week that Trump's ""ignorant view of Islam could make both our countries less safe.""

By Patricia Zengerle
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Shouts of ""Shame, shame, shame,"" erupted in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday as Republican lawmakers narrowly defeated legislation to protect the civil rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees of government contractors.The measure, an amendment to a veterans and military construction spending bill introduced by New York Democrat Sean Maloney, initially had enough ""yes"" votes to pass, according to the count in the House chamber.But House Republican leaders extended the time allowed for the vote as they urged enough party members to change their positions to defeat it by a vote of 213 to 212.All 183 Democrats who voted backed the amendment, joined by 29 Republicans. All 213 ""no"" votes were from Republicans. Eight House members - three Republicans and five Democrats - did not vote. Lawmakers are allowed to change their vote in the few minutes between voting and the result being declared.    LGBT rights have been a hot-button issue during the 2016 election season. National politics have featured debate over whether making cakes for same-sex couples violates bakers' religious freedom or whether the government should decide which public bathrooms are used by transgender people.
Democrats chanted ""Shame, shame, shame,"" at Republicans. ""House Republicans are so committed to discriminating against LGBT Americans, that they broke regular order to force their members to reverse their votes and support Republicans' bigotry,"" Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, said in a statement.Republicans who backed the provision said it was necessary to protect the religious rights of military contractors and not intended to be discriminatory.
Thursday's emotionally-charged vote came hours after the House late on Wednesday passed a $602 billion defense authorization bill that included ""religious freedom"" language that critics said would allow contractors to discriminate against LGBT individuals.The House Rules committee had angered Democrats by voting along party lines late on Tuesday not to allow a vote on an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would have eliminated that language.The House also backed by 265-159 a separate Democratic amendment to the spending bill that limits the display of the Confederate battle flag on flagpoles at federal veterans' cemeteries.
The measure angered some conservative Republicans from southern states, who argue that the flag is a symbol of their heritage.Some lawmakers have been seeking to limit displays of the Confederate banner since a racially motivated murder of nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston, S.C.  last year.

By Lawrence Hurley

Scroll to the bottom of the page for an interactive graphic. WASHINGTON William Pryor, in urging the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003 to uphold a Texas law banning gay sex, argued against the notion that the U.S. Constitution should safeguard a person's choice of partners.Pryor, who then was Alabama's attorney general and now serves on a federal appeals court, was one of 11 conservative jurists who presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has named as people he would consider nominating to the Supreme Court, if elected.""A constitutional right that protects 'the choice of one's partner' and 'whether and how to connect sexually' must logically extend to activities like prostitution, adultery, necrophilia, bestiality, possession of child pornography, and even incest and pedophilia,"" Pryor said in a legal filing to the Supreme Court.Pryor has a record of provocative remarks, as do some others on Trump's list. But many have established solid conservative judicial records that likely would appeal to Republicans in the Senate, which has the power to confirm Supreme Court nominees, and have steered clear of inflammatory rhetoric.Trump's list, unveiled on Wednesday, included judges who have indicated support for various conservative causes, range in age from 41 to 58 and hail primarily from conservative and Republican-governed states. The eight men and three women all are white.The list's release seems to have reassured some conservatives who may have doubted Trump would name a genuine conservative to the high court, which has a vacancy following the February death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.""I've heard nothing but positive about this. People in the Senate say this is going to relieve a lot of people,"" said Republican Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a key Trump supporter in the Senate.
The Republican-led Senate has refused to consider Democratic President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, arguing the winner of the Nov. 8 election to determine Obama's successor should get to fill the post. Scalia's replacement could tip the ideological balance of the court, now evenly divided with four conservative justices and four liberals.Don Willett of Texas is one of five state supreme court judges on the list. His job is an elected one.""Don Willett helped defend the right of Texas to display the (Bible's) Ten Commandments and fought the liberals who tried to remove the words 'under God' from our pledge"" of allegiance, his campaign said in a 2012 advertisement.Before becoming a judge, Willett was part of Texas' legal team that won a Supreme Court battle to display the Ten Commandments on a monument in the state Capitol despite opponents' concerns that it amounted to government endorsement of a religion.
During Pryor's stint as Alabama attorney general from 1997 to 2004, he described the 1973 Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion nationwide as ""the worst abomination in the history of constitutional law."" ABORTION AND CONTRACEPTION
Some of the judges on Trump's list have ruled against abortion and birth control rights.
Federal appeals court judges Diane Sykes, Steven Colloton and Pryor all ruled in favor of Christian objections to the mandate under Obama's healthcare law that health insurance covers birth control for women.Federal appeals court judge Raymond Gruender wrote a 2012 ruling upholding a South Dakota law that requires doctors to inform patients that women who have abortions are more likely to commit suicide. Colloton, who sits on the same court, joined the opinion.As on abortion and contraception, the U.S. Supreme Court is closely divided on the scope of the individual right to bear arms under the Constitution's Second Amendment.In a 2013 case, Thomas Hardiman, another federal appeals court judge, dissented when the majority on his court upheld a New Jersey law regulating the possession of handguns in public. Hardiman endorsed a broad reading of Second Amendment gun rights that would protect carrying weapons outside the home for self-defense.The list also includes David Stras, a member of Minnesota's Supreme Court. In 2014, that court waded into the contentious subject of when a person who is incapacitated may be taken off life support and allowed to die.The court ruled, in the case of a 57-year-old man with irreversible brain damage, that a guardian who was given medical-consent power could authorize the removal of life-sustaining treatment when ""interested parties"" agreed it would be in the incapacitated person's best interest.Stras dissented, writing that because the man had already died when the case was heard, the matter was moot and the court should have stayed out of it.

By David Schwartz
| PHOENIX

PHOENIX Arizona voters have narrowly approved a plan to pump $3.5 billion into education coffers over the next decade and put an end to a long-running legal battle, Republican Governor Doug Ducey said late on Thursday.The measure, approved by state lawmakers and Ducey last year, provides for Arizona to tap its land trust fund and provide an additional $300 for each student, from kindergarten through 12th grade, in public and charter schools.Arizona has historically ranked near the bottom of states in funding education.The latest unofficial results from Tuesday's special election showed the measure garnering 50.82 percent of votes cast throughout the southwestern U.S. state, and while some 30,000 votes remained to be counted, Ducey declared victory.""This is a huge victory for public education in Arizona,"" Ducey said in a statement. ""After years of lawsuits and fighting, we are moving forward and funding our teachers, students and schools - instead of lawyers.""
Voter approval was required because the measure involved a change to the state's constitution.The narrow margin of the result proved that a sizeable number of voters disliked the plan, said Morgan Abraham, chairman of the ""No"" campaign.
""This tells me that voters want to fund education the right way, not through the trust fund, but with general funds,"" Abraham said, adding that he was disappointed by the outcome of the vote.Much of the controversy during the campaign centered on the funding, with critics saying Arizona was jeopardizing its future by taking too much money from its land trust fund.About 60 percent of the new money will come from the trust fund, and the rest from the state's general fund.
The governor's office brokered the deal in a bid to end a 2010 lawsuit by a group of school districts and organizations that charged Arizona with failing to fund mandated inflation adjustments to schools during a recent recession.     The state's highest court already had ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and the court case was being appealed by the state at the time of the deal.

By Matt Spetalnick and David Brunnstrom
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama is still grappling with a historic decision on whether to lift the U.S. arms embargo on Vietnam just days before he travels there, the White House said on Thursday, signaling that human rights concerns could be a sticking point.Support has grown within the U.S. administration and on Capitol Hill to fully remove or at least further ease the ban on weapons sales, bolstering ties between former wartime enemies Washington and Hanoi to counter a rising China. But Obama also faces stiff opposition in some quarters.Ending the embargo - something Vietnam has long sought - would sweep away one of the last major vestiges of the Vietnam War era as Obama makes his first trip there beginning on Monday.It would also anger Beijing, which condemned Obama's partial lifting of the ban in 2014 as interference in the region.The U.S. deliberations come amid increased  tensions in the disputed South China Sea. Beijing demanded an end to U.S. surveillance in the area on Thursday after two of its fighter jets carried out what the Pentagon said was an ""unsafe"" intercept of a U.S. military reconnaissance aircraft.Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, said the administration has not yet finalized a decision on lifting the three-decade-old embargo but dodged a question on when - or even whether - an announcement might be made soon.
""It will be a subject of discussion with the Vietnamese,"" he told reporters in a preview of Obama's trip, saying the president would explain his thinking to the country's communist leadership. ""It's something that we obviously have been looking at ... in the context of our broader relationship.""White House officials made clear that the final decision would be linked in part to Vietnam's human rights situation.Concerns remain, especially among rights advocates and some U.S. lawmakers, over the government's heavy-handedness toward political opponents and treatment of workers. There is also worry that Washington will lose some leverage if it gives up the arms embargo without securing concessions for reforms.
'UPGRADE' IN RELATIONSHIP
Still, some of Obama's aides are mindful that a failure to satisfy Vietnam's calls for rescinding the ban could inject a sour note into a visit meant to open a new chapter in security and economic relations. Some Vietnamese officials are suspicious that the United States seeks to undermine their one-party rule.""What we want to demonstrate with this visit is a significant upgrade in the relationship between the United States and Vietnam as partners on many issues even as we have significant areas of difference,"" Rhodes said.
Obama, who will make stops in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, will meet Vietnam's new president, Tran Dai Quang, as well as its new prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, and Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong. He will also meet dissidents and will deliver a speech to the Vietnamese people, Rhodes saidU.S. officials say that no matter the decision on the weapons ban they expect Obama's visit to yield tangible steps to boost military cooperation. Washington is looking for increased port visits by U.S. warships, possibly including access to the strategic port at Cam Ranh Bay, and to holding naval exercises, according to a person close to U.S. thinking on the subject.(Story refiles to add dropped letter to ""rights"" in lead.)

By Alister Doyle
| OSLO

OSLO The United Nations's incoming climate chief said on Thursday she will push for rapid action under a U.N. accord to slow global warming and expressed hopes that U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump will drop calls for a renegotiation if elected.Mexico's Patricia Espinosa, a former foreign minister appointed on Wednesday to head the Bonn-based U.N. Climate Change Secretariat from July, urged all governments swiftly to ratify the 195-nation accord hammered out in Paris in December.She told Reuters that ""it's not impossible"" that the agreement, seeking to transform the global economy away from fossil fuels this century, could enter into force as early as this year, giving it strength in international law.Espinosa is at odds with Trump, who is skeptical that man-made emissions cause climate change. He told Reuters on Tuesday that he was ""not a big fan"" of the Paris accord and that ""at a minimum I will be renegotiating those agreements"".Asked about Trump's threat, Espinosa said the Paris deal was a hard-won compromise by more than 190 nations. ""It would not be easy for anybody to just say 'I want to renegotiate this',"" she said.
Nations who agreed in Paris range from top greenhouse gas emitters China and the United States, small island nations fearful of rising sea levels and OPEC members who depend on income from oil.Renegotiation ""is really not a scenario that in a multilateral process you can see as something feasible,"" she added.Espinosa said she would be ""respectful of everybody who has a role to play in any country"" but at the same time seek to build momentum for action. Many other backers of the accord have expressed dismay at Trump's call.
The Paris Agreement will enter into force once 55 nations responsible for 55 percent of global emissions formally ratify the deal. So far, 16 nations have ratified, accounting for just 0.03 percent of emissions. Many nations, including China and the United States which together represent 38 percent of emissions, say they will join this year. Espinosa, 57 and now Mexico's ambassador to Germany, will succeed Christiana Figueres of Costa Rica, who is stepping down after six years. 
Espinosa said she also will seek to link action to curb climate change to all aspects of development in coming years.She agreed with Figueres, who has said governments will have to toughen existing pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions to limit a rise in temperatures linked to more droughts, floods and rising seas.""I think it's possible but very difficult, not reachable with the commitments we have on the table,"" Espinosa said of the toughest goal in the Paris Agreement, to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times.
