By Richard Valdmanis and Valerie Volcovici
| CLEVELAND/WASHINGTON

CLEVELAND/WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax and has vowed not to let regulation stand in the way of expanded U.S. oil drilling if elected. But a group of his supporters at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this week are lobbying him to soften that stance.Youth, religious and investor activists aligned with the Republican Party are working the sidelines of the July 18-22 conclave, arguing that a greener platform could help the New York businessman-turned-politician win voters in November.""In an age where the Republicans are particularly interested in winning the presidency, they are not supporting an agenda that reflects that most Americans recognize climate change is a problem,"" said Rachel Lamb, national organizer for the Young Evangelicals for Climate Action group.Lamb and representatives from other organizations like the Greater Cleveland Young Republicans, environmental advocacy group RepublicEn, and clean energy foundation ClearPath taken part in panel discussions and held private meetings with operatives on the sidelines of the convention.Trump was formally nominated on Tuesday to compete in the Nov. 8 presidential election against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who has made combating climate change a key theme in her campaign.
The Republican Party has adopted a platform that calls coal a ""clean"" source of electricity and would open more federal land to drilling and mining, while Trump has said he would reverse some of President Barack Obama's key climate change initiatives.Some 64 percent of U.S. adults say they are worried a ""great deal"" or a ""fair amount"" about global warming, the highest reading since 2008, according to the results of a Gallup poll released in March.
Cade Marsh, a representative of the College Republican National Committee, said he was hoping to convince Republicans in Cleveland this week that environmentalism and conservatism are not mutually exclusive.""'Climate change' is a word that is seen as far left,"" Marsh said. ""But if you repackage clean energy in terms of national security and liberty, you'll find people much more receptive,"" he said, referring to the role of renewable energy sources like wind power and solar power in reducing dependence on foreign oil.He said his message has been warmly received by convention attendees, but that he held out little hope of a turnaround in Trump's policies. ""This is about tomorrow's Republican party,"" Marsh said.
Jay Faison, a North Carolina Republican donor who founded the ClearPath foundation, said he was telling Republican operatives in Cleveland this week that he would prefer to fund candidates who can put clean energy on the party's agenda.""I wonder about the opportunities with the persuadable voters in the middle in terms of the general election,"" he said.

By Emily Flitter and Amy Tennery
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND A staff writer for the Trump Organization took responsibility on Wednesday for the ""chaos"" caused by a speech given by the wife of U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that drew accusations of plagiarism and cast a shadow over the party's convention this week.The writer, Meredith McIver, apologized and offered an explanation that threw into sharp relief two days of efforts by the Trump campaign to deny there had been a problem with Melania Trump's speech on Monday night.The Republican convention in Cleveland, which formally anointed Trump on Tuesday as the party nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, was meant to be an occasion for the party to rally around its unorthodox White House candidate after a bitterly divisive primary campaign.But the accusations of plagiarism, and the Trump campaign's responses to them, have been a major talking point just as the party tries to showcase a candidate who it believes can appeal to voters and a campaign operation capable of beating Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election.In a statement, McIver said she had inserted passages into the Melania Trump speech that resembled parts of a 2008 speech by first lady Michelle Obama to the 2008 Democratic National Convention, when Barack Obama was in his first campaign for the presidency.McIver said she had offered to resign over the speech controversy, but Trump and his family had rejected the offer.  The Trump Organization is owned by Donald Trump.Trump defended McIver in an ABC News interview on Wednesday, saying: ""She made a mistake. People make mistakes. You've made mistakes. We all make mistakes.""He said McIver had been with him for a long time and was a ""good person."" Trump added: ""I thought it was terrific the way she came forward and just said, 'Look, it was a mistake that I made.' She thought it was very unfair to Melania.""In her speech on Monday, Melania Trump spoke of passing on to the next generation the value of hard work that she inherited from her parents and said that ""the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.""""My parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise; that you treat people with respect,"" Melania Trump told the Cleveland convention.
In Denver eight years ago, Michelle Obama said she and her husband, Barack, ""were raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say you're going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect.""    McIver said Melania Trump had read passages from Michelle Obama's speech over the phone to her as examples. McIver then wrote them down and later included some of the phrasing in a draft that became Melania Trump's speech.McIver said in her statement that Michelle Obama is a person Melania Trump ""has always liked."" 'MY MISTAKE'
""I did not check Mrs. Obama's speeches. This was my mistake and I feel terrible for the chaos I have caused Melania and the Trumps, as well as to Mrs. Obama. No harm was meant,"" McIver said.
Nowhere in the statement by McIver and comments by Trump campaign officials on the speech has there been any sense of irony that the wife of the Republican nominee was inspired by the words of Michelle Obama at the same time that speaker after speaker at the Republican convention, echoing Trump, assailed her husband's policies.Democrats have seized on the similarities in the speech and the Trump campaign's various explanations over the ensuing 48 hours as showing that his team is not ready for prime time. The charge was all the more embarrassing because Trump has repeatedly slammed Clinton as untrustworthy.White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Wednesday the similarities showed the country's values were largely shared, even if political leaders had differences.""That certainly buttresses an argument that the president has been making quite frequently of late, about the country not being as divided as it might seem,"" Earnest told reporters. 
'BUNGLED SO BADLY'
Questions have lingered over why the Trump campaign had not run simple plagiarism software that is commonly used to ensure that speakers do not inadvertently lift other people's words, and why the campaign sought to deny and brush away the problem.Republican strategist Ted Newton, president of Gravity Strategic Communications and a staffer in Republican Mitt Romney's failed 2012 presidential campaign, said the Trump campaign should have come clean much sooner.""It sort of reflects the old adage: It's not the crime, it's the cover-up,"" Newton said. ""To have it bungled so badly is really a shame and sad for her.""If the campaign had admitted what happened sooner, Newton said, ""It would have been a bump in the road.""Hours before giving the speech, Melania Trump, a Slovenian-born jewelry designer and former model, told NBC's ""Today"" that she had written it with as little help as possible. But her husband's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, told CBS' ""This Morning"" on Tuesday that it was a collaboration with speech writers.As late as Wednesday, just hours before McIver's statement, Manafort was pressed again on the issue on CNN. He did not say words had been lifted from the Michelle Obama speech and sought to stress the overall effectiveness of the speech. ""The controversy that you're talking about is not meaningful at all,"" he said. McIver is listed as a writer on some of Trump's most popular books, including ""Trump: How to Get Rich"" and ""Trump: Think Like a Billionaire."" Her author's biography in ""How to Get Rich"" says she was a Ford Foundation scholar who graduated from the University of Utah, as well as a member of the Trump Organization.

2	2	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-purge-exclusive-idUSKCN10003A	Exclusive: Trump could seek new law to purge government of Obama appointees	"


By Emily Flitter
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND If he wins the presidency, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump would seek to purge the federal government of officials appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama and could ask Congress to pass legislation making it easier to fire public workers, Trump ally, Chris Christie, said on Tuesday.Christie, who is governor of New Jersey and leads Trump's White House transition team, said the campaign was drawing up a list of federal government employees to fire if Trump defeats Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election. ""As you know from his other career, Donald likes to fire people,"" Christie told a closed-door meeting with dozens of  donors at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, according to an audio recording obtained by Reuters and two participants in the meeting.Christie was referring to Trump's starring role in the long-running television show ""The Apprentice,"" where his catch-phrase was ""You're fired!""The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.Trump's transition advisers fear that Obama may convert these appointees to civil servants, who have more job security than officials who have been politically appointed. This would allow officials to keep their jobs in a new, possibly Republican, administration, Christie said.""It's called burrowing,"" Christie said. ""You take them from the political appointee side into the civil service side, in order to try to set up ... roadblocks for your successor, kind of like when all the Clinton people took all the Ws off the keyboard when George Bush was coming into the White House.""Christie was referring to pranks committed during the presidential transition from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush in 2001. During that period, some White House staffers removed the W key on computer keyboards and left derogatory signs and stickers in offices, according to a report by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress.""One of the things I have suggested to Donald is that we have to immediately ask the Republican Congress to change the civil service laws. Because if they do, it will make it a lot easier to fire those people,"" Christie said.
He said firing civil servants was ""cumbersome"" and ""time-consuming.""WHITE HOUSE ATTACKS CHRISTIE
Christie also said that changing the leadership of the Environmental Protection Agency, long a target of Republicans concerned about over regulation, would be a top priority for Trump should he win in November.Trump has previously vowed to eliminate the EPA and roll back some of America's most ambitious environmental policies, actions that he says would revive the U.S. oil and coal industries and bolster national security.
Christie added that the Trump team wants to let businesspeople serve in government part time without having to give up their jobs in the private sector. Trump frequently says he is better equipped to be president because of his business experience.Although Christie was repeatedly asked during the meeting, he declined to name any potential Cabinet picks. He said Trump was not ready to do that yet.Responding to Christie's comments on targeting political appointees on Wednesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that allowing appointees to apply for career civil service positions was ""a longstanding precedent."" ""If you want to stack up the ethical record of President Obama and his political appointees against the ethical record compiled by Governor Christie and his political appointees, that we'd welcome that kind of comparison,"" he said.
The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union in the United States, said while it was concerned about the practice of ""burrowing,"" current law protected most federal employees from at will firing.""The federal government is a serious undertaking. It's not a reality TV show, with 'You're fired!'"" said Jacqueline Simon, policy director at AFGE.""Just as we don't want to hire anybody for political reasons, we don't want anybody to be fired for political reasons,"" she said.As of March 2016, there were a total of 3,164 political appointees, 852 of whom were presidential appointees. In its most recent report on the topic, the Government Accountability Office said in 2010 that 143 former political appointees and congressional employees converted to career positions between May 1, 2005, and May 30, 2009. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee is investigating the practice of burrowing.It sent letters dated Wednesday to 23 federal departments and agencies, asking them to document all cases of burrowing that have occurred since Sept. 1, 2015.

By Jonathan Stempel
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK A federal appeals court said on Wednesday the U.S. government cannot seize a Midtown Manhattan office tower originally built by the Shah of Iran, whose owners it claimed were fronts for the Iranian government.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also said hundreds of victims of ""terrorist acts"" linked to Iran could not force the owners of 650 Fifth Avenue to turn over the building or pay unsatisfied money judgments they had won against the country, finding no proof that the owners and Iran were legally one and the same.Both decisions were written by Circuit Judge Richard Wesley for a unanimous three-judge panel, and totaled 145 pages.They overturned rulings by U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest against the nonprofit Alavi Foundation, which promotes Islamic culture and the Persian language, and 650 Fifth Avenue Co, of which Alavi is a 60 percent owner.The owners had claimed they were given no chance to show why they should not be held liable. Iran was not a defendant in the lawsuits, which were returned to Forrest's courtroom, including for a possible trial in the government's forfeiture case.""We are very pleased,"" Daniel Ruzumna, a lawyer for the owners, said in an email. ""We look forward to vindicating our clients' rights and interests at trial.""
James Bernard, a lawyer for the victims, said his clients also looked forward to a trial.The office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan did not respond to a request for comment.The 36-story building in question is just north of Rockefeller Center and St. Patrick's Cathedral, and would likely fetch hundreds of millions of dollars in a sale.
In seeking the forfeiture of that building, several other properties and various bank accounts, authorities accused Alavi of engaging in money laundering that violated U.S. sanctions against Iran, and knowing that the building's minority owner, Assa Corp, was backed by state-controlled Bank Melli.But Wesley said Forrest failed to properly review evidence that demonstrated a ""genuine dispute"" as to whether Alavi knew of Bank Melli's control over Assa.He also said Forrest acted too quickly in rejecting defense arguments that authorities waited too long to seek a forfeiture, and that evidence obtained by a search warrant should have been suppressed.
In the victims' case, Wesley said Forrest erred in finding that the building's owners could under the federal Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act qualify as Iran itself, or be deemed its agents or instrumentalities.The appeals court directed Forrest to examine whether the victims could prevail under another federal law, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act.The cases are In re: 650 Fifth Avenue and Related Properties, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-2027; and Kirschenbaum et al v. 650 Fifth Avenue and Related Properties in the same court, No. 14-1963.

By David Shepardson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz USA and Daimler Vans units and Ferrari NV are among a small group of automakers selling some new vehicles with faulty Takata airbags that will be subject to recalls by the end of 2018, a U.S. Senate report said on Wednesday.The vehicles are legal to sell since the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has said they will not become potentially unsafe until exposed to high humidity for an extended period. Safety advocates and some in Congress have criticized the sale of vehicles that will be recalled.Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, said the vehicles include the 2016 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter and 2016-2017 Mercedes-Benz E-Class Coupe/Convertible and numerous 2016 and 2017 Ferrari models including the FF, California T, 488 GTB/488 Spider, F12/F12tdf and GTC4 Lusso.Nelson said the report underscores ""the failure of certain automakers and regulators to level with people about the true extent of the problem and to have the cars fixed before they're sold.""
Mercedes Benz USA spokeswoman Donna Boland said the company has told regulators that its ""dealers will be informing prospective buyers of the pending recall on these models at the time of purchase in the very near future.""Ferrari spokeswoman Krista Florin said the Italian automaker also plans to notify customers of the future recalls.Seven out of 17 automakers Nelson contacted have admitted to equipping some new vehicles with defective Takata airbags, including Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE). All agreed to notify buyers of the planned recalls.
Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) is the only automaker that has not provided a written response, Nelson said. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday from Reuters. NHTSA said in May Tesla would be required to recall vehicles for Takata inflators.Takata inflators can explode with excessive force and spray metal shrapnel. They are suspected in at least 13 deaths worldwide and more than 100 injuries.
In May, Takata agreed to declare as defective, by 2018, another 35 million to 40 million U.S. inflators that lack drying agents in frontal airbags after 14 automakers previously recalled more than 24 million U.S. vehicles. Worldwide nearly 100 million inflators have been declared defective.NHTSA said there have been no ruptures in vehicles built since 2008. According to NHTSA, the vehicles do not become vulnerable to exploding airbags without long-term exposure to high humidity. In the short-term, the agency says, they are safe to drive and much safer than older models. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Meredith Mazzilli)"	['Nelson']	[]

NEW YORK The U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton, the group's first-ever endorsement for a presidential nominee and a rebuke of Republican Donald Trump in the middle of his party's convention.The Trump campaign ""has gone from frankly something that was entertaining, comical, and has devolved into something that is frankly scary,"" said Javier Palomarez, the chamber president and chief executive officer.He said the group weighed in because of Trump's rhetoric, which has angered many in the U.S. minority community. Trump has been accused of bigotry for his hard line on immigration, and many of his comments have been blasted as racist ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election.""It wasn't a step that was taken easily,"" Palomarez said, noting that many of the chamber's board and members are ""staunch Republicans.""Trump kicked off his campaign last year saying Mexico was sending rapists and drug dealers across the border, and he proposed building a wall to stop them. He has called for a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants to shore up national security and suggested an Indiana-born federal judge was unable to hear a lawsuit against his Trump University venture because the judge is of Mexican descent. 
The New York businessman's positions have angered minority groups, liberals, Democrats, and even some Republicans, who have called them racist, divisive and callous. Among black, Hispanic and Asian voters polled in the first 15 days of July, 70 percent supported Clinton while 9 percent supported Trump, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll. Over that time, 45 percent of all likely voters supported Clinton and 34 percent supported Trump. Trump became his party's official nominee to the presidency on Tuesday at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.
Palomarez said the Clinton campaign earned their group's endorsement by doing significant outreach to Latinos, including asking to speak with chamber members in different parts of the country. ""I think she understands the challenges of American small businesses,"" he said.
The convention had a dramatic start, as anti-Trump delegates tried, and failed, to force a roll-call vote that would record the number of delegates opposed to the New York real estate developer.The chamber is an organization of Hispanic business leaders representing the interests of Hispanic-owned businesses nationwide. It had endorsed Clinton and Republican John Kasich in their respective primaries, the group's first-ever such endorsements.

By Mana Rabiee
| FALLS CHURCH, Va.

FALLS CHURCH, Va. U.S. Muslim leaders hope to register a million voters from within their community to help combat what they say is the anti-Muslim stance of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.The United States has only about 3.3 million Muslims, but campaign organizers say Muslim voters could have an outsize impact in swing states that are key to the November general election, such as Virginia and Florida.""We want the Muslim community to understand that if you give up your rights voluntarily, no one will come and give it back to you,"" said Osama Abu Irshaid, a member of the board of the U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations, which is spearheading the drive.Imams have been asked to encourage their congregations to register to vote. Organizers have sent canvassers to college campuses, bus stations and gas stations in Muslim neighborhoods.The campaign began in December and is part of an effort among U.S. Muslims to combat an ""unprecedented rise in Islamophobia,"" said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).CAIR's database showed that 300,000 Muslims had registered since November, he said.
Awad said anti-Muslim sentiment had grown since the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, last year that authorities have said was inspired by Islamist militants, and due to comments by Trump. He has called for a ban on Muslim immigrants.Campaign volunteers were outside the Dar al-Hijrah mosque in suburban Washington this month to get worshippers to register.""I was thinking quite a long time to register but this time especially ... I really believed that I have to,"" said Sadat Najmi as he filled out a registration form.
Najmi, a U.S. citizen since 1988, said Trump had motivated him to sign up for the first time.U.S. Muslim backers of Trump said they were trying to build their own coalitions in swing states. Baltimore businessman Sajid Tarar said he launched American Muslims for Trump because he favored Trump's stance on combating radical Islam.
""ISIS (an acronym for the Islamic State), al Qaeda, Taliban, they have killed more Muslims than anything else, and that's a message Muslims need to hear and understand,"" he said, referring to various militant groups.Michael Cohen, co-chair of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump, which aims to mobilize minority support, said Muslim Americans were equally worried about violence at home and abroad.Trump is ""the only candidate who will enhance our national security, bring jobs back to America and fix our ailing economy,"" he said in an email.

By Ginger Gibson and Emily Stephenson
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan offered his strongest support yet for Donald Trump's White House bid on Tuesday at the Republican National Convention, saying the New York businessman he has repeatedly criticized provides America ""a chance at a better way."" Behind the scenes in Cleveland, the highest-ranking elected Republican has been shopping a competing vision for the party, backed by some wealthy donors and Republican establishment figures who see him as the savior of a party thrown into turmoil by Trump's candidacy.The support reflects deep divisions within the party over Trump's harder line on stemming illegal immigration and his threats to scrap trade deals that he says have hurt American workers but establishment Republicans view as central to their free trade policies.The split has created an identity crisis for the party, embodied in the figures of Trump and Ryan. ""Everybody knows the tough spot Paul Ryan is in,"" said Annie Dickerson, a New York delegate to the convention and close adviser to Republican financier Paul Singer, referring to Ryan's dilemma in backing a candidate as the party's standard bearer in the Nov. 8 presidential election who does not represent many of its traditional values.""He's the antidote to all the frustration that's in Cleveland this week,"" she said, noting that despite a public push for unity, there are those still unhappy with Trump's nomination.Ryan, 46, is chairman of the convention at which Trump was officially nominated on Tuesday. But he has kept a low profile, avoiding the convention's opening day on Monday, and instead holding meetings with state delegations and addressing private gatherings of Republican supporters, according to aides and attendees.At the meetings, according to attendees, Ryan has been pushing his ""Better GOP"" platform, a six-part agenda that shares strong similarities to the form of conservatism President George W. Bush advocated - reduced regulation, lower taxes, and welfare reform. It contrasts with the speeches typically delivered by Trump, who prefers to lambaste his opponents and skip detailed policy discussions.
Doug Heye, a former House Republican leadership aide close to Ryan, said Ryan's platform ""gives them something that they can talk to constituents about that isn't divisive, that isn't name calling."" POLITICAL SUICIDE
Heye said the approach could help Ryan position himself as the face of the party if Trump loses the election. 
Ryan has publicly clashed with Trump over the latter's promise to deport millions of illegal immigrants and end trade deals. He criticized Trump's call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country and called his remarks about the heritage of a Mexican-American judge racist.Ryan supports free trade and comprehensive immigration reform, and as chairman of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, he authored a document that called for a drastically reduced federal government. The risk for Ryan is that a swath of the party is moving away from traditional Republican orthodoxy, and by not embracing Trump he could find himself isolated. Some of Trump's supporters see him as emblematic of the Washington dysfunction that has angered many Republicans. Mark Bolin, a Canton, Ohio, business owner who supports Trump, called Ryan's tepid endorsement of Trump ""political suicide."" He said Ryan and other Republicans leaders can't admit their own failures.
""Instead of them thinking there's something wrong with their party, they think it must be us, the American people aren't smart enough,"" Bolin said. Ryan has long been seen as a rising star and some wealthy donors pushed Ryan, who was the vice presidential nominee in 2012, to run for president this year. He declined but hasn't ruled out running in the future.Advisers to Singer and the billionaire industrialist Koch brothers say the donors are banking on Ryan to carry the flag for traditional Republican values.""I like Ryan and his day to lead the party will come - very soon, if Trump loses,"" said energy magnate Dan Eberhart, another major donor.  Linda Devore, 66, a retired attorney from Fayetteville, North Carolina, who met Ryan for the first time in 2012, rushed over to give him a hug when he arrived on Tuesday morning to speak to her delegation at a hotel in the Cleveland. ""He's just one of the smartest Republicans. That's what I told him,"" Devore said. ""He's a quick wit. He said, 'Pretty low bar, huh?'""

By Emily Stephenson and Amy Tennery
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND Thirteen months after launching an improbable bid for the White House, Donald Trump captured the 2016 Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday, having vanquished 16 party rivals, warred with much of its establishment and provoked controversy at every turn.His eldest child, Donald Trump Jr., announced the support of New York, their home state, during a roll-call vote at the Republican National Convention, ensuring Trump had the majority of delegates - 1,237 - needed to contest the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.With three of the candidate's other children at his side, the younger Trump said: ""It is my honor to be able to throw Donald Trump over the top in the delegate count tonight.""""Congratulations, Dad. We love you,"" he said.Trump's Democratic rival, Clinton, who has been the target of withering verbal attacks during the convention, was quick to respond to the vote, tweeting: ""Donald Trump just became the Republican nominee. Chip in now to make sure he never steps foot in the Oval Office.""Trump won with 1,725 delegates, followed by U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas with 475 delegates, Ohio Governor John Kasich with 120 and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida with 114. Three other candidates emerged with a total of 12 delegates.After the presidential nominating vote, the convention by voice vote nominated Indiana Governor Mike Pence, 57, Trump's choice for his vice presidential running mate.TV CELEBRITY
Speaking to the convention for the first time since winning the nomination, Trump appeared on a video screen from New York promising to win the election in November, create jobs, strengthen the military, safeguard U.S. borders and ""restore law and order"" in the United States.The state-by-state vote to put Trump's name in nomination took place a day after opponents staged a failed attempt to force a vote opposing his candidacy at the start of the four-day convention, and after a speech by his wife, Melania, drew accusations of plagiarism.A wealthy New York real estate developer best known to Americans for his starring role in a long-running TV show, ""The Apprentice,"" where his catchphrase was ""You're fired,"" the 70-year-old Trump was a long shot when he entered the race for the Republican nomination more than a year ago, having never held elected office.
On Tuesday, under the headline ""Make America Work Again,"" speakers at Cleveland's Quicken Loans basketball arena were meant to assail Democratic President Barack Obama's record on the economy during his nearly eight years in power.Instead, speaker after speaker took aim at Clinton, presenting her as out of touch with the concerns of ordinary Americans and the inheritor of Obama's ""oppressive"" administration.A former secretary of state under Obama, Clinton, 68, was due to be formally nominated at the Democratic National Convention next week in Philadelphia.Trump trails Clinton in many opinion polls after a bruising Republican primary season. Trump narrowed his deficit against her to 7 percentage points from 15 points late last week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday. COMMANDING LEAD
Trump initially refused to rule out an independent run should he fail to win the Republican nomination. 
Within weeks of announcing his candidacy at Trump Tower in New York on June 16, 2015, Trump had taken a commanding lead in the Republican race, defying pundits who were quick to write him off and eclipsing the man many had thought would be crowned on Tuesday night - former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, part of a Republican political dynasty.In a campaign marked by insults and inflammatory rhetoric, Trump tapped into a deep vein of unhappiness running through white Middle America, giving voice to millions who felt left behind in the rush to globalization and who eschewed traditional establishment Republicans like Bush in favor of a brash political outsider who promised to ""Make America Great Again"".""We've lost the confidence in our leaders and the faith in our institutions,"" Donald Trump Jr. said in a convention speech. ""We're still Americans.
