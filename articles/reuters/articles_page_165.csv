By Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Puerto Rico, the U.S. commonwealth that recently declared a historic default, could be shut out of debt markets for two more years as it battles with fiscal challenges, the island's governor said on Tuesday.Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said emergency fiscal measures in response to a $70 billion debt were not sustainable and that ""Puerto Rico will not endure any more austerity.""  He said a new law enacted by Washington allowing the federal government to appoint a control board would undercut self-government, but added it would help the island confront its fiscal problems.""Our challenges are not over and prosperity will not return overnight,"" the governor said during a discussion at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington.
""It will take maybe two years until the market opens back to Puerto Rico if we do the right thing,"" Garcia Padilla said, adding the government had been producing fiscally sound budgets that would help win back creditors. The island has been shut out of debt markets for about a year.Citing falling debt levels, he said it was a ""moment of opportunity"" in Puerto Rico, which has struggled with high debt loads and a weak economy for years. 
Puerto Rico defaulted on $779 million of constitutionally backed debt on July 1, among its most senior bonds, opting to pay for essential services for its citizens over obligations to creditors. Garcia Padilla said the Puerto Rican government would take steps on its own to get its fiscal affairs in order, therefore minimizing meddling by the oversight board.
For example, he said that if the island's government passed responsible budgets on its own, the control board would not need to impose its own fiscal plans.Garcia Padilla said, however, that while the government must become more efficient to improve its fiscal situation, that should be done through attrition rather than laying off workers. Asked by a reporter about steps that could be taken to shore up the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or PREPA, and the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, or PRASA, Garcia Padilla said: ""PREPA is pretty advanced. We'll be able to reduce a lot the debt related to PREPA. We want to do the same with PRASA. I think we'll be able to do it.""

WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate on Tuesday voted to work on a compromise with the House of Representatives on what could become the broad energy legislation passed by Congress in nearly a decade. The Senate voted 84 to 3 to go to formal conference with the House on legislation to take modest steps on modernizing the power grid, speeding the permitting of exports of liquefied natural gas, and increasing research and funding for energy efficiency and batteries. Congress is slated to begin summer recess on Friday and the conference is expected to work on the compromise energy legislation after returning in September.Senators who will work with House lawmakers on a deal in conference include Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator John Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican in the chamber.  The Senate energy bill passed in April, while the House energy bill passed last year. 
Lawmakers in the House have removed items such as limits on energy efficiency that the White House has said Obama would veto.Among items to be worked out between the two chambers will be the speed of LNG export permitting process. The Senate version of the bill limits federal reviews to 45 days while the House version limits them to 30 days. 
""My objective here is to deliver a law,"" Senator Lisa Murkowski, the chairman of the Senate energy committee, said about the conference process, shortly before the measure passed. Before becoming a law, an agreement worked out in conference would have to be passed by both chambers and signed by Obama. Industry group the American Petroleum Institute praised the step, saying the bill would boost U.S. energy infrastructure and ensure ""that American natural gas has a dominant place on the world market.""
Environmental group the League of Conservation Voters welcomed progress on the debate on energy efficiency but warned that some of the potential measures to be discussed in conference ""will not amount to the true overhaul our energy sector needs.""Meanwhile, the House of Representatives debated a bill to fund the Interior Department and Environmental Protection Agency. The White House on Monday said Obama would veto that measure if it passes because it ""underfunds"" key Department of Interior programs and slashes the EPA's operating budget.

By John Whitesides
| PORTSMOUTH, N.H.

PORTSMOUTH, N.H. Democrat Bernie Sanders endorsed former rival Hillary Clinton for president in a display of party unity on Tuesday, describing her as the best candidate to fix the United States' problems and beat Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election.With Clinton nodding in agreement beside him, Sanders put aside their bitter campaign for the Democratic nomination and said she would take up the fight to ease economic inequality, make college more affordable and expand healthcare coverage for all Americans.""This campaign is about the needs of the American people and addressing the very serious crises that we face, and there is no doubt in my mind that, as we head into November, Hillary Clinton is far and away the best candidate to do that,"" he told a raucous crowd in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, that included plenty of vocal Sanders supporters.""I intend to do everything I can to make certain she will be the next president of the United States,"" the U.S. senator from Vermont said.His endorsement, five weeks after Clinton became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, brought the most prominent holdout in the party's liberal wing into her camp. Sanders threw Clinton his support less than two weeks before the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, where she is to be formally nominated.""I can't help but reflect on how much more enjoyable this election will be now that we are on the same side,"" Clinton said of Sanders. ""Thank you, Bernie, for your endorsement, but more than that, thank you for your lifetime of fighting injustice.""Trump ridiculed the move in a series of Twitter posts, saying Sanders had abandoned the supporters who flocked to his insurgent campaign to rein in Wall Street and get big money out of politics.""Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs,"" Trump said on Twitter. In a statement, the Trump campaign said Sanders was now officially part of the rigged system the senator had criticized during his long primary battle with Clinton.
""Bernie's endorsement becomes Exhibit A in our rigged system - the Democrat Party is disenfranchising its voters to benefit the select and privileged few,"" said Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser to Trump.In a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday, Clinton extended her lead over Trump to 13 percentage points, up from 10 points at the end of last week.The former U.S. secretary of state hopes the Portsmouth appearance with Sanders will help her win over his supporters, some of whom held Sanders signs at the rally and chanted his name. In recent Reuters/Ipsos polling, only about 40 percent of Sanders backers said they would back Clinton, and the crowd at Tuesday's rally made it clear she still had work to do.""I am absolutely certain I will not vote for Hillary Clinton,"" said Gale Bailey, a Sanders supporter and an unemployed graphic designer from Rochester, New Hampshire, who attended the rally in a Sanders T-shirt.""She's a crook, and I'm not going to vote for a crook,"" Bailey said, adding that she would write in Sanders' name on the November ballot.
SANDERS VICTORIES ON PLATFORM
The joint appearance concluded weeks of negotiations between the two camps as Sanders pressed for concessions from Clinton on his liberal policy agenda.It came after Clinton last week adopted elements of Sanders' plans for free in-state college tuition and expanded affordable healthcare coverage. Sanders also successfully pushed to include an array of liberal policy positions in the Democratic platform, which a committee approved on Saturday.
Sanders did not win all of his policy fights, most notably failing to win support for blocking a congressional vote on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.But he told the Portsmouth rally that ""our job now is to see that platform implemented by a Democratically controlled Senate, a Democratically controlled House and a Hillary Clinton presidency - and I am going to do everything I can to make that happen.""In an email to supporters after the rally, Sanders said he would still push for changes to the party's nominating process to make it more inclusive. In the months ahead, he will campaign around the country for progressive congressional candidates, he said.Also on Tuesday, a source with knowledge of the process said the Clinton campaign is vetting James Stavridis, a retired four-star Navy admiral, as a potential vice presidential running mate. Stavridis, who served as supreme allied commander at NATO, is currently dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. Top Democrats, including President Barack Obama and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a favorite of the party's liberal wing, have already announced their support for Clinton, leaving Sanders at risk of being left behind in the Democratic battle against Trump.""I think all signs point to the fact that we're going to have a very united party going into Philadelphia,"" Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said on CNN earlier on Tuesday, ""and when you compare it to the Republicans, we're going to be miles ahead of them."" Trump has struggled to unify the Republican Party after alienating many establishment figures with his stances on immigration, Muslims and women. A number of prominent Republicans are skipping the party's convention in Cleveland next week. (Additional reporting by Steve Holland in Washington; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Jonathan Oatis)"

By Richard Cowan and David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Congress is headed for a seven-week recess without addressing gun violence, the Zika virus outbreak and other pressing issues, amid persistent election-year bickering.Despite recent gun violence, the House of Representatives will not vote this week on a proposal to keep firearms out of the hands of people on terrorism watch lists, that chamber's Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters on Tuesday.Similarly, President Barack Obama's request for $1.9 billion in funds to combat the Zika virus and the birth defects it can cause has been stalled in Congress since February.Republicans and Democrats were also at odds over spending bills to keep the government functioning beyond Sept. 30, when current fiscal year funding expires.When Republicans took control of Congress, they vowed to get things done but have had difficulty doing so during this election year, failing to pass a budget or even consider Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to fill a Supreme Court vacancy.Congress did, however, approve bipartisan legislation helping Puerto Rico out of a crippling debt crisis and is trying to make progress on legislation to improve police relations with local communities in the aftermath of gun violence.
With barely four days left before the start of an unusually long recess, a failure to vote on guns would postpone any possible action by the House until at least Sept. 6, when lawmakers return.After that, they will work only for short stints ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential and congressional elections.Mass shootings in Orlando and Dallas, and gun violence in other cities, has again propelled gun control to prominence. But the National Rifle Association and its allies in Congress so far have staved off legislation.
Gun control is generally opposed by Republicans and supported by Democrats. Some Republicans have talked about a gun bill possibly moving through Congress in the fall, in the midst of the campaign season, but Democrats were skeptical.""This Congress will do nothing on curbing gun violence,"" Representative Xavier Becerra of California, a member of the House Democratic leadership, told reporters.The two sides even disagree on whether House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi talked about a proposal to establish a special committee to study gun violence. Democrats say Pelosi raised the issue with Ryan last week. Ryan's office says he has never discussed the topic with anyone.
Republicans in the House and Senate have signed onto a $1.1 billion Zika funding bill. But Democrats are balking over what they see as ""poison pills"" attached to the money that would deny funds to women's healthcare provider Planned Parenthood and ease some environmental provisions.Democrats, who warn the current legislation will not pass the Senate, said on Tuesday that they offered to accept some Republican provisions. But Senate Republicans insist the bill cannot be altered. Ryan meanwhile showcased his ""A Better Way"" agenda, flashing a glossy pamphlet at a press conference listing proposals designed to lure votes in November but do nothing this year legislatively.Republicans have also pushed for new federal probes of Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, on her use of private emails while secretary of state.

By Julia Harte
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The top U.S. law enforcement official, under questioning from Republicans at a congressional hearing on Tuesday, shed no new light on the Justice Department's decision not to prosecute Hillary Clinton over her handling of sensitive emails.Attorney General Loretta Lynch deflected questions about the department's inquiry into Clinton's use of a private email system while she was secretary of state, an issue that has hounded her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.Republicans grilled Lynch at the House of Representatives committee hearing over Justice's decision not to charge Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 election.""Lynch has no intention of answering ... even the most basic questions about the legal elements the government is obligated to prove in a criminal prosecution,"" said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican.
Democratic lawmakers at the hearing largely avoided the subject, asking Lynch about gun control and policing reforms. Lynch referred questions about the department's decision to an FBI-led investigative team that recommended not bringing charges. She said she was ""extremely proud"" of the team's work, testifying one week after the FBI closed its year-long probe.The emails case is a favorite target for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, as well as other Republican politicians.
Goodlatte and Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz asked the Justice Department on Monday to investigate whether Clinton committed perjury in testimony to Congress about the emails.Other investigations continue. At least one federal judge is seeking to establish whether Clinton set up the email system to thwart laws governing the public's access to official records. Judge Emmet Sullivan of the district court in Washington, who is overseeing a lawsuit accusing the State Department of not complying with records requests by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, is considering whether to order that Clinton give testimony about the system under oath. 
Clinton's lawyers argued against her having to testify in court papers filed on Tuesday, saying she had no more information to provide that was not already in the public record and that the Justice Department still had her emails and computer equipment. Judge Sullivan is due to rule on whether to order the deposition after a hearing next Monday.FBI Director James Comey told a congressional hearing last week he recommended against charging Clinton because there was insufficient evidence that she acted with bad intent. He added that any of his employees who handled emails the way Clinton did could be subject to dismissal or loss of security clearance.

CHICAGO Former two-term Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich is seeking a drastically reduced sentence that would see him released from federal prison within a year after convictions in 2011 for corruption charges including extortion and wire fraud, according to U.S. court documents.Federal prosecutors countered, recommending in documents filed just before a midnight Tuesday deadline that Blagojevich serve out his original 14-year sentence, of which he has served more than four years.The motions come ahead of a scheduled resentencing on Aug. 9 before U.S. District Judge James Zagel after an appellate court last year vacated five of Blagojevich's 18 criminal convictions. Prosecutors declined to retry the ex-governor on the vacated convictions.Blagojevich, a Democrat, was the first Illinois governor to be removed from office and has been in federal prison in Colorado since 2012. The former governor was convicted on charges including seeking money in exchange for an appointment to the senate seat formerly held by President Barack Obama.
His attorneys argued in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois that the flamboyant former U.S. House Representative has made efforts toward restitution, tutoring fellow prison inmates and playing in a band with a since-released inmate called the Jailhouse Rockers. They said that Blagojevich's release from prison early would allow him to repair his relationship with his wife and two daughters.
""A sentence in the neighborhood of five years incarceration accompanied by a period of supervised release would be sufficient,"" Blagojevich attorney Leonard Goodman said in a filing.U.S. prosecutors argued that Blagojevich should serve out the entire sentence as he still does not take responsibility for his illegal actions. ""(Blagojevich's) continued insistence that he lacked intent to commit the crimes of which he was convicted further demonstrates a complete lack of acceptance,"" they said.

By Ben Blanchard
| BEIJING

BEIJING In 2010, then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton provoked outrage in Beijing when she pushed the South China Sea to the top of the regional and U.S. security agendas.Now as an international court prepares to hand down a ruling that threatens China's sweeping claims in the vital waterway, Beijing is watching Clinton's presidential run with trepidation. Combined with her tough line on human rights and role in leading President Barack Obama's Asia ""rebalancing"", Clinton is well-known in China - but not well liked. While presidential rival Donald Trump has irritated Beijing with comments such as comparing the U.S. trade deficit with China to rape, he is largely an unknown quantity, a person who even privately officials shrug their shoulders over.""Clinton will be a difficult partner,"" one senior Chinese diplomatic source told Reuters, having just admitted to not knowing much about Trump or what he stands for.  Chinese diplomats take some comfort that Clinton's views are known to them from years of high-level contacts, from her days as first lady to her Senate tenure to her time as secretary of state. But they are also mindful that even while seeking diplomatic accommodations, she has been a staunch critic of Beijing on a range of issues, including the South China Sea, trade and human rights.China remembers clearly a 2010 Southeast Asian security summit in Hanoi, when Clinton waded into the South China Sea dispute, saying open access and legal solutions were a U.S. ""national interest"" and ""pivotal to regional security"".In a strongly worded response, China stressed the South China Sea as one of its ""core interests"", putting the issue up there with Taiwan, Tibet and Xinjiang in terms of its importance to Beijing.China warned its rival claimants and neighbors not to be emboldened by U.S. support - a line it has repeated ever since.An arbitration court hearing the dispute between China and the Philippines over the South China Sea is set to hand down its ruling on in the Dutch city of The Hague on Tuesday. Legal experts expect at least some substantive findings to go against China, which has vowed to ignore the ruling.STRENGTH, RESPECT
China's military, which is ramping up its presence in the South China Sea as part of a major modernization program, is also watching the election closely.         
""Hillary is very fierce when it comes to China,"" a Chinese official close to the military establishment told Reuters.While the Chinese government has been largely quiet about the U.S. election, state media has not been so restrained, with one paper even equating Trump to Hitler. In May, China's official Xinhua news agency noted Trump's more isolationist campaign compared to Clinton's, who it described as an ""old foreign policy hand"" and important backer of the Asia-Pacific ""pivot"" that China considers a threat.""As far as she's concerned, being tough on foreign policy is perhaps the best way to show America's so called 'leadership',"" it said in a commentary.Laura Rosenberger, a Clinton campaign foreign policy adviser who worked with her in the State Department, told Reuters Clinton would remain tough on the South China Sea issue.""She believes that we need to be very strong in terms of standing up to many of the actions the Chinese have taken,"" Rosenberger said.
""She believes in the principles of freedom of navigation in international waters, that commerce on the high seas in incredibly important to the United States, and that these are really very direct interests that we need to continue to stand up for.""Trump adviser Peter Navarro, an economist at University of California Irvine and the author of the book, ""Crouching Tiger: What China's Militarism Means for the World,"" said a Trump presidency would lead to respect.""The central difference between a Trump administration and the current administration or a Clinton administration is respect. The leaders of Russia, the leaders of China will respect Mr. Trump, will respect America because we will be strong economically, militarily and politically.""UNKNOWN QUANTITY
Trump may actually find some sympathy in China, even if he is seen as an unknown quantity. ""Who is Trump? We don't really know. We do know he hates Muslims though - and that will be well received in some circles here,"" said the Chinese official with ties to the military, pointing to what China views as its war on terror in its Muslim-populated far western region of Xinjiang.
China also views Trump as a businessmen with whom they can probably negotiate.""It would be very transactional for the Chinese,"" said a senior Western diplomat in Beijing. ""He's a businessman they think they'll be able to strike a deal with.""Trump may also be less tough on China over human rights than Clinton, who has frequently clashed with Beijing on the issue. In 2011, Clinton said China was on a ""fool's errand"" to try to halt the march of freedom, while in 2012 she was deeply involved in efforts to get blind dissident Chen Guangcheng out of China after he fled to the U.S. embassy in Beijing. Trump advisor Navarro said Clinton's record on human rights abuse was ""sketchy at best and abysmal at worst"", highlighting her first trip to Asia as Secretary of State in 2009, where other issues were given priority.""So it's difficult to see how she would have someone would view her as credible on that issue."" Rosenberger, the Clinton adviser, rejected that view, highlighting comments from Trump in a 1990 interview referring to the ""strength"" of the Chinese government in its bloody crackdown of student-led protests in Tiananmen Square a year earlier.""It's ironic for Trump's adviser to criticize Hillary's statement there when Trump himself has actually praised the Chinese for the Tiananmen massacre,"" Rosenberger said. Still, China is hoping that whoever wins they will understand that both countries need each other and will have to work closely, a source with ties to the Chinese leadership told Reuters, requesting anonymity.""It is the most important bilateral relationship in the world. China needs the United States and vice versa,"" the source said. ""We don't know who will be the lesser of two evils.""

That recommendation was accepted by Attorney General Loretta Lynch.The FBI found, however, that she was ""extremely careless"" while secretary of state in her handling of email documents that contained classified information.
Representative Elijah Cummings, the senior Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform panel, accused Republicans of a political vendetta following years of Republican-led investigations of Clinton in the House.""Republicans are now squandering even more taxpayer dollars in a desperate attempt to keep this issue alive and bring down Secretary Clinton's poll numbers ahead of the election,"" Cummings said.
Clinton has said that she did not believe she was handling classified information on the private email system.

By David Morgan and Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Prospects dimmed on Monday for the U.S. House of Representatives to vote this week on Republican legislation to restrict gun sales to suspected extremists before Congress goes on a seven-week summer break. Republicans including House Speaker Paul Ryan have been under pressure to act on gun legislation since the June 12 mass shootings at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Congress begins a summer recess on Friday.But with the House floor schedule filling with other bills, Republicans said gun legislation was unlikely to come up before September, when prospects for serious action could be overshadowed by the fall presidential election campaign.  Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, who heads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said, ""I do not anticipate that bill.""
The measure, backed by the National Rifle Association, would give government authorities three days to convince a judge to block the sale of weapons to someone suspected of involvement in violent extremism.But Ryan has been unable to win support from conservative Republicans who say the measure poses potential constitutional problems and should be subjected to regular legislative channels including formal hearings.
Republican lawmakers say discussions aimed at finding compromise are continuing. But the measure did not come up at a Monday meeting with Republican leaders to discuss the week's agenda, said another lawmaker who predicted it would not see a vote this week.  The stalemate leaves hanging Democratic demands for stronger gun restrictions, despite an unprecedented 25-hour sit-in by House Democrats last month, and sidelines any potential movement on an alternative bipartisan bill seen as a possible compromise.
""A vote is going to be stalled"" until Congress returns from its long summer break, one Republican aide said.Lawmakers initially believed Congress could pass some kind of measure before their summer recess after the Orlando shootings raised national security concerns and polls showed a majority of Americans in favor of greater restrictions.

WASHINGTON The House of Representatives on Monday approved an aviation bill that would upgrade security at U.S. airports in the aftermath of the Brussels and Istanbul attacks while extending funds for the Federal Aviation Administration for another 14 months.The approval, by a simple voice vote, sends the legislation to the Senate, where lawmakers were expected to approve the measure and forward it to the White House for President Barack Obama's signature before Congress leaves for a seven-week summer break on Friday.The measure includes provisions from an earlier Senate bill that require tougher vetting of aviation workers with access to secure airport areas, expedited security checks to move passengers more quickly from airport areas that are not secured and a larger number of police dogs for security duty in the U.S. transportation system.
It extends the current level of federal funding for FAA programs through September 2017.Congress has been struggling to find agreement on a more comprehensive package to reauthorize the U.S. aviation regulatory agency. A measure that would have provided FAA funding over six years stalled in the House earlier this year, amid disagreement over a proposal to privatize the U.S. air traffic control system.
House Republicans say they intend to use the time between now and September 2017 to find ways to move the privatization plan forward.
