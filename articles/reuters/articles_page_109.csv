PHILADELPHIA U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday  ended his ban on press credentials for some news outlets seeking to cover his campaign events, including The Washington Post and Buzzfeed, a policy that had drawn strong criticism from press freedom advocates.Trump's ban at times also included Politico and The Huffington Post, following coverage that was critical of him. The banned organizations had continued covering his campaign, but they could not get credentials to formally attend his events, including sitting in the media section at rallies. Those outlets now will be able to obtain media credentials, as well as travel with other reporters covering the Republican candidate, campaign spokesman Hope Hicks confirmed.Press freedom advocates strongly condemned such bans. Reporters without Borders said when the Post was banned in June that it was an ""act of hostility"" toward the media and a serious violation of press freedom.""Revoking press credentials was imprudent, pointless and offensive from the start. We're pleased to see the ban come to a long-overdue end,"" Washington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron said in a statement on Wednesday.
Sam Stein, senior politics editor for the Huffington Post, said on Twitter the outlet was no longer blacklisted. ""They even returned my email to confirm it,"" he said of the Trump campaign.Reporters from the banned organizations had often gained access to Trump campaign events by waiting in the same lines as the general public, but they could be tossed out by members of his security team if discovered.
Trump's vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, said last month that the campaign was discussing reversing the ban, but no change had been announced before Wednesday.""I figure they can't treat me any worse,"" Trump, a New York businessman, told CNN in a statement declaring the ban over.

By Steve Holland and Jeff Mason
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Donald Trump declared on Wednesday that Russia's Vladimir Putin had been a better leader than U.S. President Barack Obama, as the Republican presidential nominee used a televised forum to argue he was best equipped to reassert America's global leadership. Trump suggested at the event in which he and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton made back-to-back appearances that U.S. generals had been stymied by the policies of Obama and Clinton, who served as the Democratic president's first secretary of state.""I think under the leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton the generals have been reduced to rubble. They have been reduced to a point that's embarrassing for our country,"" Trump said at NBC's ""Commander-in-Chief"" forum in New York attended by military veterans. It was the first time Trump and Clinton had squared off on the same stage since accepting their parties' presidential nominations in July for the Nov. 8 election.Clinton was grilled over her handling of classified information while using a private email server during her tenure at the State Department. FBI Director James Comey had declared her ""extremely careless"" in her handling of sensitive material but did not recommend charges against her.""I did exactly what I should have done and I take it very seriously, always have, always will,"" she said.Trump's praise of Putin and his suggestion that the United States and Russia form an alliance to defeat Islamic State militants could raise eyebrows among foreign policy experts who feel Moscow is interfering with efforts to stem the Syrian civil war.""If he says great things about me, I'm going to say great things about him,"" Trump said of the Russian president. ""Certainly in that system, he's been a leader, far more than our president has been.""Trump had called Obama ""the founder of ISIS,"" an acronym for Islamic State, in stump speeches several weeks ago. The statement drew broad criticism, prompting him to take a more disciplined approach to campaigning. He has since picked up ground on Clinton in national opinion polls.Trump also flirted with revealing what he had been learning in classified intelligence briefings given to him by U.S. officials because he is the Republican nominee.""There was one thing that shocked me,"" Trump said. ""What I did learn is that our leadership, Barack Obama, did not follow what our experts ... said to do, and I was very, very surprised. ...Our leaders were not following what they recommended.""Earlier on Wednesday, Trump pledged to launch a new U.S. military buildup, saying America was under threat like never before from foes like Islamist extremists, North Korea and China.
DEBATE PREVIEW?
The event offered a prelude to how Clinton and Trump will deal with questions on national security issues in their three upcoming presidential debates later in September and in October.Clinton began the forum saying her long experience in government as a U.S. senator and secretary of state made her uniquely qualified to serve as president.She said she had ""an absolute rock steadiness"" to be able to make tough decisions, a not so subtle dig at Trump, who Democrats say is temperamentally unfit for the White House.
Moderator Matt Lauer doggedly pressed her about her handling of emails from a private server while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. The issue has raised questions about whether she can be trusted to serve as president.Clinton said none of the emails she sent or received were marked top secret, secret or classified, the usual way such material is identified. Appearing in the second half of the hour-long show, Trump faced questions about his fitness for office. Asked if he would be prepared on Day One to be commander in chief, Trump said: ""One hundred percent.""Trump quickly abandoned Lauer's entreaties to avoid attacking his opponent and focus on what he would do if elected president in November.""She's been there for 30 years,"" Trump said. ""We need change, and we need it fast."" The event brought together the meticulously prepared Clinton, 68, the wife of former President Bill Clinton, and Trump, 70, a New York businessman whose brash, freewheeling style has allowed him to dominate the headlines during his campaign.
Clinton said she regretted her decision as a U.S. senator from New York to vote in favor of the much-criticized 2003 Iraq war and that Trump had been in favor of it as well. Trump has condemned the war during his campaign and said he would avoid lengthy conflicts in the Middle East.On the U.S. intervention in Libya in 2011, Clinton rejected Trump's criticism of her support for the effort as secretary of state.""Permitting there to be an ongoing civil war in Libya would be as threatening and as dangerous as what we are seeing in Syria,"" she said.Trump said Clinton's handling of Libya proved disastrous. Republicans have made much of the fact that the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, was killed in an Islamist attack in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.""She made a terrible mistake in Libya,"" said Trump.Clinton said U.S. policies under her leadership at the State Department had helped promote security.""We made the world safer,"" she said.

VIENTIANE U.S. President Barack Obama hit back at Donald Trump on Thursday for criticizing his foreign policy record, saying the Republican nominee was unfit to follow him into the Oval Office and the public should press him on his ""outright wacky ideas"".Speaking in Laos at the end of the second of two Asian summits, Obama said the tycoon's lack of leadership credentials was exposed whenever he spoke and American voters were aware of that.""I don't think the guy's qualified to be president of the United States, and every time he speaks, that opinion is confirmed,"" Obama told a news conference.""The most important thing for the public and the press is to just listen to what he says and follow up and ask questions about what appear to be either contradictory or uninformed, or outright wacky, ideas.""
Trump declared on Wednesday during a televised forum attended by military veterans that Russian President Vladimir Putin had been a better leader than Obama.Trump said the progress of U.S. military generals had been stymied, or ""reduced to rubble"" with Obama as commander-in-chief and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton as his first secretary of state. It was the first time Trump and Clinton had squared off on the same stage since securing their nominations in July.
Obama said he believed his foreign policy legacy would be one of success, particularly his so-called ""rebalance"" to Asia. He said Asian leaders would be puzzled by Trump's remarks, and Americans would know who to choose as president on Nov. 8.
""I have confidence that if, in fact, people just listen to what he had to say, look at his track record or lack thereof, that they'll make a good decision,"" he said. (Reporting by Roberta Rampton; Writing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre and Martin Petty; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)"

By Manuel Mogato
| VIENTIANE

VIENTIANE Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday defended his country's human rights record at a regional summit in Laos, urging East Asian leaders and the United States to help Manila eradicate the scourge of illicit drugs.Duterte swept to power in May on promises to wipe out crime and corruption within six months, pledging to wage a war on drug dealers and crush widespread addiction in a country of 100 million.The toll in his government's two-month war on drugs reached 2,400 last week, with police saying about 900 people died in police operations, and the rest were ""deaths under investigation"", a term human rights activists call a euphemism for vigilante and extrajudicial killings.Setting aside a prepared speech, Duterte spoke for more than five minutes about human rights and his campaign against drugs during the East Asian Summit in the Laotian capital of Vientiane, according to one Indonesian diplomat at the meeting.
""Let me tell you about human rights,"" the diplomat quoted Duterte as saying while displaying a picture of Filipinos killed by American soldiers about a century ago.""This is my ancestors being killed, so why now we are talking about human rights? We have to talk of the full spectrum of human rights.""
Duterte spoke after Obama had delivered a speech that referred to human rights.   Duterte's drive has won popular support at home but the killings have drawn expressions of concern from the United States, a close Philippine ally, and the United Nations.
In a tirade before the Laos summit, Duterte insulted U.S. President Barack Obama and the White House responded by cancelling a two-way meeting.Philippine officials this week handed out a 38-page pamphlet at the summit that praised Duterte's drug campaign.

By Richard Cowan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. lawmakers sought on Wednesday to break a logjam over $1.1 billion in funding to combat the Zika virus, with the Senate possibly considering legislation as soon as next week, even as one congressman toted a jar full of mosquitoes to the House floor to condemn congressional inaction.""Can you imagine the fears and anxieties if the mosquitoes were not in this jar?"" Florida Republican David Jolly told his colleagues as he brandished the container holding about 100 of the insects in the House of Representatives chamber.""Members of Congress would run down the hall to the physician's office to be tested,"" added Jolly, whose state is the first in the nation with local transmission of the mosquito-borne virus that has spread through the Americas.The potential Senate Zika measure could advance as part of a broader legislative effort to temporarily keep federal agencies operating in the 2017 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.Republicans and Democrats huddled separately in closed meetings in both the Senate and House to see if they could reach a compromise during a 19-day work session this month, before lawmakers break for a recess in the weeks before the Nov. 8 U.S. election. Lawmakers returned to work this week after a seven-week summer recess.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters he was in talks with Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid.
""We're looking for a way forward. And I'm hopeful and optimistic that we'll be able to do that,"" McConnell, a Republican, said of both a temporary agency funding bill and Zika money.In February, President Barack Obama asked Congress to approve $1.9 billion in emergency funds to deal with the Zika virus, which can cause severe birth defects when pregnant women become infected.Since then, both parties have backed $1.1 billion as the funding figure. But fights over side issues related to abortion and Obama's signature healthcare law have bitterly divided the two parties.
One of the biggest controversies involves Democrats' opposition to language, backed by Republicans, that they say would prevent Zika funds for abortion providers like Planned Parenthood, mainly in Puerto Rico.The Miami Herald on Tuesday quoted Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, who chairs a Senate panel overseeing healthcare funding, suggesting the Planned Parenthood language might have to be dropped in order to reach a deal.Aides to both senators declined to confirm or deny the accuracy of the quotes.
Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine, asked by Reuters whether she thought Planned Parenthood funding restrictions should be eliminated from Zika legislation, said: ""That would be my preference.""Still, some Republicans were resisting a deal that would abandon the Planned Parenthood language in the Zika bill.

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said on Wednesday she hoped ""cooler heads will prevail"" over the vacancy on the Supreme Court, suggesting that Republicans should act on President Barack Obama's nominee.Ginsburg's comments at Georgetown Law Center came a day after Democrats in the Republican-controlled Senate renewed their push for a confirmation hearing for Obama's pick, appeals court judge Merrick Garland. The nomination has been pending for 175 days without Senate action, the longest ever to the high court. Republicans have said the next president should get to make the appointment because the vacancy, created by the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia in February, came in the final year of Obama's presidency.
""I do think that cooler heads will prevail, I hope sooner rather than later,"" Ginsburg said.Ginsburg, 83, a liberal appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1993, acknowledged that the Senate, which has the responsibility to confirm or reject judicial nominations, did not have to confirm the nominee. But she said it did have an obligation to at least consider Garland instead of taking no action at all.
""The president is elected for four years, not three years,"" she said in relation to the president's authority to make appointments in the final year of a term. ""Maybe some members of the Senate will wake up and appreciate that that's how it should be.""Earlier on Wednesday, Democratic senators held a press conference outside the Supreme Court demanding action on the nomination.
But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has so far held firm to his pledge to take no action.The nine-seat court has been one justice short since Scalia's death. With four liberals and four conservatives now on the bench, an appointment by a Democratic president could end decades of conservative domination on the court.Ginsburg has a long track record of making sometimes outspoken public remarks, in stark contrast to most of her colleagues. In July, she issued a statement in which she said she regretted comments she made in press interviews criticizing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. In one CNN interview she described him as a ""faker."""

LIMA The head of Peru's central bank said on Wednesday he gets the goose bumps when he thinks about what would happen to the global economy if U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump wins the November election.Responding to questions from reporters on the sidelines of an economic forum, Julio Velarde called Trump's statements about scrapping trade deals and imposing tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports ""very dangerous.""""If the man does a fraction of what he says he will, we could go back to the '30s,"" Velarde said in reference to the Great Depression of the early 1930s. ""It gives me the goose bumps.""The comments were videotaped and posted online by local financial daily Gestion.The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The New York businessman has broken with the Republican Party's traditional embrace of free trade. He has vowed to rip up the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal to which Peru is a signatory, and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico that he blames for the loss of U.S. jobs.Trump has also threatened to slap tariffs on Chinese products to show Beijing that Washington is serious about leveling the field on trade.
Velarde, named central banker of the year in 2015 by the Financial Times magazine The Banker, has headed Peru's central bank since 2006 and recently agreed to stay on for a third five-year term.Peru's new president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, has also voiced worries about a Trump presidency.

WASHINGTON Members of the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives will discuss next week whether the nation's top tax collector, John Koskinen, should be impeached over conservative charges he stonewalled a congressional investigation, House leaders said Wednesday.Democrats decried the move as a politically motivated embarrassment that would in any case be stopped in the Senate. Even some Republicans said they did not think Koskinen's activities justified impeachment from his post as Internal Revenue Service (IRS) commissioner.Conservative Republicans in the House have said Koskinen failed to comply with a congressional investigation into whether the IRS applied extra scrutiny to applications for tax exempt status by conservative groups between 2010 and 2012.House Speaker Paul Ryan and other leading House Republicans have shown little interest in pursuing impeachment. But Ryan indicated Wednesday that he expected floor action because conservatives had filed a privileged resolution, which can bypass regular procedures and take precedence on the House floor.""This is something that we're going to have a planning conference on next week,"" Ryan told a regular press conference. ""This is something where Congress is going to work its will.""
The Senate's Democratic leader, Harry Reid, called the process a ""waste, put that in big capital letters"" and said it could be blocked in the Senate by that chamber's Majority Leader, Republican  Mitch McConnell.A spokesman for McConnell declined to say what action McConnell might take if the House does vote for Koskinen's impeachment.
""I know Koskinen very well,"" another senior Senate Republican, Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch told Reuters. ""Yeah, he's made mistakes but he hasn't made mistakes that justify an impeachment.""Koskinen became IRS commissioner in December 2013, after the controversy already had exploded over the way the agency had handled the applications for tax exempt status.
Members of the House Freedom Caucus, the chamber's most conservative bloc, have said Koskinen should be pushed out because of his role in the aftermath of the scandal. They noted that he was commissioner when backup tapes were destroyed containing emails from former IRS official Lois Lerner, who had headed the IRS' tax-exempt division.Democrats have noted that the Justice Department brought no criminal charges against Lerner and say the case against Koskinen shows little more than agency mismanagement and misstatements.

By Phil Stewart
| OXFORD, England

OXFORD, England U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter on Wednesday warned Russia against interfering with Western ""democratic processes"" and accused Moscow of aggressive behaviour aimed at eroding the international order. Carter's remarks follow hacking attacks on Democratic Party organisations in the run-up to the U.S. election on Nov. 8, some of which U.S. officials and cyber security experts have blamed on hackers working for the Russian government.Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has blamed Russia and expressed concern about possible Russian interference in the election.The Kremlin has denied involvement in the hacks.""We don't seek an enemy in Russia. But make no mistake - we will defend our allies, the principled international order, and the positive future it affords all of us,"" Carter said in an address to students at Oxford University.
""We will counter attempts to undermine our collective security. And we will not ignore attempts to interfere with our democratic processes.""Pressed by reporters, Carter said his concerns were not about ""the United States only"" but did not offer specifics, nor did he indicate whether he was referring to the hacking attacks, but he said that the NATO alliance has long worried about Russian meddling in other nations' domestic affairs.U.S. Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and has called on Moscow to dig up tens of thousands of ""missing"" emails from Clinton's time as head of the U.S. State Department. He later said his comments were meant to be sarcastic.
Relations between Russia and United States hit a post-Cold War low in 2014 over the Ukraine crisis, and Washington and Moscow have since clashed over diverging policies in Syria.Carter sounded a pessimistic tone on diplomatic efforts between the two to try to agree a ceasefire and nudge the Syrian government towards a political transition to end the conflict.""Today's news out of Syria is not encouraging. The choice is Russia's to make ... and the consequences will be its responsibility,"" he said.
On another front, U.S. officials said a Russian fighter jet carried out an ""unsafe and unprofessional"" intercept of a U.S. spy plane over the Black Sea on Wednesday.Citing Russia's ""unprofessional behaviour"" in the air, space and cyberspace, Carter said: ""Russia appears driven by misguided ambitions and misplaced fears.""""It lashes out, alleging that it fears for its own viability and future, even though no nation - not the United States, not the United Kingdom - seeks to defeat it or constrain its potential,"" he said.
