WASHINGTON President Barack Obama said on Monday that his administration's guidance on transgender issues is needed to help schools grapple with the sensitive topic and ensure that all children are treated fairly.Obama, in an interview with BuzzFeed news website broadcast live on Facebook and YouTube, said schools had been asking the Department of Education how they should handle questions they were facing with transgender youths.""We think it was important for schools who want to go ahead and, in a very practical way, try to deal with the school year - What are they going to be doing next year? How should we approach this? - that we give them our best judgment about how to approach it,"" Obama said.The Obama administration told U.S. public schools on Friday that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting Republicans and raising the likelihood of fights over federal funding and legal authority.
The Education and Justice Departments told school districts nationwide that while the guidance carries no legal weight, they must not discriminate against students, including based on their gender identity.Obama, who has two teenaged daughters, elaborated on the decision.
""We're talking about kids. And anybody who's been in school, been in high school, who's been a parent, I think, should realize that kids who are sometimes in the minority, kids who have a different sexual orientation or are transgender are subject to a lot of bullying, potentially,"" Obama said.
""They are vulnerable. And I think that it's part of our obligation as a society to make sure that everybody is treated fairly and our kids are all loved and that they're protected and that their dignity is affirmed,"" he said. (Reporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)"	['Obama']	[]

| ATLANTA

ATLANTA Actor Wendell Pierce, who starred in HBO's ""The Wire,"" was arrested in Atlanta over the weekend and charged with battery after an altercation sparked by differences in opinion about the U.S. presidential race, police said on Monday.The incident occurred early Saturday morning after Pierce, a Hillary Clinton backer, got into a political debate with a couple at the Loews Atlanta Hotel, according to an Atlanta Police Department arrest report. Media reports said the couple supported Clinton rival Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination.The police report said Pierce followed the couple through the hotel and tried to force his way into their room, and also that he pulled the woman's hoodie off and hit her in the head. Pierce denied the allegations, police said, and no one needed medical attention.Pierce's representatives could not be reached for comment.
On Monday, Rutgers University-Newark said Pierce had withdrawn as the speaker for the school's commencement this week, citing the incident.Pierce declined to give the address ""in order to assure that commencement 2016 will be a celebration of the accomplishments of our students, free from distractions,"" the school said in a statement, adding that journalist Soledad O'Brien would replace him as speaker.
""In addition to his role as Baltimore police detective Bunk Moreland on HBO's critically acclaimed 'The Wire,' Pierce, 52, is also known for roles on television shows including ""Treme"" and ""The Odd Couple"" as well as the film ""Selma."" He was arrested early on Saturday and released after posting a $1,000 bond, according to police and jail records.
Media reports said Pierce, whose residence was listed as Pasadena, California, was staying at the Atlanta hotel while shooting a film.  (Additional reporting by Chris Michaud; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Alan Crosby)"	['Sanders', 'Clinton']	[]

By Joseph Ax

Representative Chaka Fattah of Pennsylvania and several associates orchestrated a series of fraudulent schemes to enrich the congressman and preserve his political career, federal prosecutors said at the start of his corruption trial on Monday.""The congressman stole from federal agencies, from taxpayers, from nonprofit educational groups he created,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Gray told a Philadelphia jury. ""He even stole from his own political campaigns.""But defense lawyers said the government's case relied almost entirely on the word of two convicted felons who received favorable plea deals.""Congressman Fattah had nothing to do with any of it,"" said Mark Lee, a lawyer for Fattah.The 59-year-old Fattah, an 11-term congressman who represents parts of Philadelphia, lost the Democratic primary in April under the cloud of a wide-ranging indictment charging him with racketeering, bribery and fraud.
Some of the alleged schemes stemmed from Fattah's unsuccessful 2007 mayoral campaign, when prosecutors say he accepted a secret and illegal $1 million loan from Al Lord, former chief executive officer of student loan servicer SLM Corp, known as Sallie Mae.Following the race, Fattah convinced Karen Nicholas, who ran his nonprofit educational organization, to transfer charitable and federal grant money to pay Lord back, Gray said.Separately, Fattah owed consultant Thomas Lindenfeld more than $100,000. With no funds to repay him, Fattah encouraged Lindenfeld to apply for federal money for a nonprofit that didn't exist, prosecutors said.
In a third scheme, Fattah funneled campaign money through another consultant, Gregory Naylor, to pay off his son's student debt, prosecutors said. The son, Chaka Fattah Jr., was convicted in an unrelated fraud case and sentenced earlier this year to five years in prison.Both Lindenfeld and Naylor have pleaded guilty in exchange for testifying against Fattah.Prosecutors also said Fattah accepted bribes from a close friend, retired businessman Herb Vederman, who was seeking a U.S. ambassadorship. Fattah personally appealed to President Barack Obama to appoint Vederman to an international post.
""Congressman Fattah used Herb Vederman as a human ATM machine whenever he needed a little money,"" Gray said.But lawyers for Fattah and Vederman said prosecutors had ""cherry-picked"" evidence to suggest a bribery scheme when the two men simply acted out of friendship.Nicholas, Vederman and two other Fattah associates, consultant Robert Brand and campaign treasurer Bonnie Bowser, are co-defendants in the trial, which is expected to last eight weeks.

By Guy Faulconbridge and Kate Holton
| LONDON

LONDON Donald Trump said he was unlikely to have a good relationship with David Cameron because the British prime minister cast the U.S. presidential candidate as ""divisive, stupid and wrong"" for proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States.Cameron criticised Trump in the British parliament over his call for the ban on Muslims and suggested that the New York billionaire, who is now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, would unite Britain against him if he visited.""It looks like we're not going to have a very good relationship, who knows?"" Trump told Britain's ITV television station in an interview aired on Monday when asked how ties would fare if he won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8.""Well number one, I'm not stupid, okay. I can tell you that right now. Just the opposite. Number Two, in terms of divisive: I don't think I'm a divisive person. I'm a unifier, unlike our president right now,"" Trump said, referring to Barack Obama.Cameron's spokesman said the prime minister stood by his original comments.The United States is Britain's closest ally. U.S. companies are the biggest foreign direct investors in Britain and the so- called 'special relationship' with Washington has been the cornerstone of British diplomacy since World War Two.Trump's often controversial comments on everything from Muslims and women to the future of NATO and relations with Russia have drawn criticism from Berlin, Paris and other European capitals.
But neither Germany's Angela Merkel nor France's Francois Hollande have gone as far as Cameron in chiding Trump who, if he wins in November, would be in charge of the world's most powerful nation and largest economy from January 20 next year.""DIVISIVE, STUPID AND WRONG""
Cameron will work with whoever is elected U.S. president and is committed to maintaining the special relationship, the prime minister's spokesman said.
""The PM has made his views on Donald Trump's comments very clear. He disagrees with them,"" the spokesman said. ""He continues to believe that preventing Muslims from entering the U.S. is divisive, stupid and wrong. He stands by his comments.""The spokesman refused to answer questions on who Cameron would like to see win in November but said there was no telephone call or meeting planned with Trump, adding: ""If one is proposed we will consider it.""On a more conciliatory note, Cameron has said Trump deserves respect for making it through the gruelling Republican primary process. The Times newspaper also reported last month Cameron had ordered diplomats to attempt to repair relations with Trump.
""I hope to have a good relationship with him but it sounds like he's not willing to address the problem either,"" Trump told ITV.Trump also criticised London's newly elected Muslim mayor Sadiq Khan for making ""very rude statements"".Trump had initially welcomed Khan's election and said he would make an exception in the event of a ban on Muslims for him entering the United States, drawing a sharp reply from Khan.""Donald Trump's ignorant view of Islam could make both our countries less safe - it risks alienating mainstream Muslims around the world and plays into the hands of the extremists,"" Khan said.Responding to this criticism in the ITV interview, Trump said: ""He doesn't know me, never met me, doesn't know what I am all about. I think they are very rude statements. Frankly, tell him I will remember those statements. They are very nasty statements. It is ignorant for him to say that.""

By Luciana Lopez
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democratic Party activists in some U.S. states are using Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate who has stirred controversy with his comments about illegal immigrants and women, as the centerpiece of their ""get out the vote"" campaign for the November elections.In California, canvassers from the Orange County Democrats carry pictures of Trump when they knock on doors ahead of the June 7 California primary. They ask if people will vote in the primary, and warn that if they don't help pick the strongest possible Democrat, ""this guy will win,"" said Henry Vandermeir, the local party chairman in Orange County, a traditionally Republican island in the state. Democrats in New Hampshire have unveiled Trump/Sununu lawn signs, looking to tie Republican gubernatorial candidate Chris Sununu to the presumptive Republican presidential nominee on issues such as climate change (Trump is a skeptic) and healthcare.One sign reads: ""Trump/Sununu. Because Health Care Is For Losers,"" a swipe at Trump's vow to repeal the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law.""Every state party is trying to maximize what they can get out of this difference (between candidates) and to tie Trump to the Republicans in the state,"" said Holly Shulman, a spokeswoman for the New Hampshire Democratic Party. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.To be sure, Republicans appear likely to use Hillary Clinton, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination who is also a polarizing figure, in a similar fashion. 
""There is no better volunteer recruitment tool, fundraising pitch, or unifier for the Republican Party than the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency that will surely take us further backwards,"" the Republican National Committee said in a statement.""RETRUMPLICANS""
Democrats are also looking to tie Trump to Republican Senate candidates on the Nov. 8 ballot as they seek to regain control of the chamber they lost in the 2014 congressional elections.
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee last week released so-called ""Trump cards"" online, equating several Republican senators' policy positions with those of the New York developer.    For Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey and New Hampshire's Kelly Ayotte, for example, the DSCC highlighted how they and Trump oppose a federal minimum wage hike. The DSCC also launched a website in March, partyoftrump.com, which labeled some senators ""Retrumplicans"" and asked for donations to help fight senators who support Trump.Recent polls suggest that a Trump/Clinton matchup could be a tight race. The two candidates were in a dead heat in the three key swing states of Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania in a Quinnipiac University poll earlier in May.
And a Reuters poll this month showed that much of the backing for Clinton and Trump comes from people whose primary motivation is to stop the other side from winning, rather than any love for either of the two candidates or their policies.    The strategy of highlighting opposing candidates is not without risks, according to Bruce Newman, the author of ""The Marketing Revolution in Politics: What Recent U.S. Presidential Campaigns Can Teach Us About Effective Marketing.""If Trump - who shocked pundits by beating 16 other Republican hopefuls for the nomination - proves more attractive to the general electorate than Hillary Clinton, then tying him to other Republicans could hurt Democrats""We don't know how popular this guy is going to get,"" Newman said.

""He is committed to maintaining the special relationship,"" he said.The spokesman said no meeting or call between Cameron and Republican candidate Trump was currently planned, but if one were proposed the prime minister would consider it.

By Ginger Gibson and David Lawder

WASHINGTON, 2016 - A top aide to Donald Trump said on Sunday he did not believe the Republican presidential front-runner posed as his own spokesman to brag about his personal life, a controversy that came as Democrats sharpen their attacks on the billionaire's character. The Washington Post released an audio recording on Friday of a man who identified himself as Trump publicist ""John Miller"" and talked about the real estate tycoon's romantic encounters in a 1991 conversation with a People magazine reporter.After listening to the tape while appearing on CNN's ""State of the Union"" show, senior Trump adviser Paul Manafort said he did not believe it was the Republican candidate's voice despite his past admissions of sometimes using a pseudonym. ""I could barely understand it,"" Manafort said. ""I couldn't tell who it is. Donald Trump says it's not him, I believe it's not him.""Trump told NBC's ""Today"" show on Friday that the voice was not his, although he has admitted in years past to using at least one pseudonym to speak to reporters. The original People article, which ran in 1991, winkingly described Miller as ""a mysterious PR man who sounds just like Donald.""Within a few days of that article, Sue Carswell, the People reporter who originally made the recording, reported that Trump had admitted that he posed as Miller as a joke and had apologized for it.Trump earlier this month effectively locked up the Republican nomination to run in the Nov. 8 presidential election and has been working to try to unify his party after many of its leaders opposed his candidacy.
Leading Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's allies have described Trump as ""deceptive"" and honed in on his treatment of women. Clinton has begun attacking Trump more aggressively since he effectively secured the nomination, deriding his character and recently suggesting he is hiding something by not releasing his tax returns.Trump has reacted angrily to criticism he sometimes reduces women to their appearances, and in turn has criticized Clinton for how she and her husband, Bill Clinton, treated women who accused the former president of sexual indiscretions.Bill Clinton has admitted to having extra-marital affairs with two women: Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, and Gennifer Flowers, a singer and actor from Arkansas.  On Sunday, Trump used his Twitter account to deride a New York Times article in which several women said he had ""unnerved"" them over the years with comments about their looks and unwelcome advances. The article also said he had a good track record of promoting women to senior positions, which was rare in the real estate industry.
""Everyone is laughing at the @nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and women,"" went one message posted on Trump's account on Sunday.'LOTS OF PEOPLE USE PEN NAMES'
Democratic President Barack Obama used a commencement speech at a university on Sunday to criticize Trump's positions, including a proposal to temporarily ban non-American Muslims from entering the United States.
""Isolating or disparaging Muslims, suggesting that they should be treated differently when it comes to entering this country, that is not just a betrayal of our values, that is not who Americans are,"" he told the students at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Although it was widely reported in the early 1990s that Trump sometimes posed as a fake spokesman in order to shape media coverage, the recording of what is said to be such an occurrence only emerged a few days ago.It quickly rippled through American media. The comedy television program ""Saturday Night Live"" showed a skit with an actor posing as Trump calling reporters pretending to be his own spokesman, named John Pepperoni.Trump's willingness to pose as a fake spokesman first emerged in 1990, when he testified during a lawsuit that he had used the pseudonym John Baron, sometimes rendered in news reports as John Barron, when speaking to journalists by telephone.""Lots of people use pen names,"" Newsday quoted Trump as saying after his testimony. ""Ernest Hemingway used one.""

Presidential politics crept into the graduation ceremony at the University of Pennsylvania on Sunday, with presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic Vice President Joe Biden in attendance to cheer on family members.The two men sat relatively near each other at the event in Philadelphia, where the Trump family gathered to watch the real estate tycoon's daughter, Tiffany, graduate from the Ivy League school. Biden came to support granddaughter Naomi.Tiffany Trump, 22, is the daughter of Trump and his ex-wife Marla Maples. Naomi Biden is named after the vice president's one-year-old daughter, who died in a 1972 car accident along with the girl's mother, Biden's first wife.
Donald Trump, who earlier this month effectively secured the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election, also attended the University of Pennsylvania, graduating from its Wharton business school.
Biden, who is not running in the 2016 election, has been a bitter critic of Trump's policies and campaign tactics, calling the Republican front-runner's remark that Mexico was sending rapists and other criminals across the border a ""sick message.""
