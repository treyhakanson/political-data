By Emily Stephenson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will propose allowing parents to deduct spending on childcare from their income taxes in a speech on Monday meant to challenge the economic policies of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, a campaign aide said.The aide, who asked not to be identified, said on Sunday in outlining the plan: ""We don't want it to be an economic disadvantage to have children."" The aide said the campaign would have a more detailed childcare plan in the future.A wealthy businessman seeking his first public office, Trump seeks to counter Clinton's argument he is out of touch with the problems of working families. He will also say that, unlike Clinton, his business policies would encourage companies to remain in the United States, a concern of blue-collar workers he has tried to court, the aide said.In his speech, to business leaders of the Detroit Economic Club, Trump will also propose stronger protections for American intellectual property and a temporary moratorium on new regulations, the aide said.Seeking to move beyond a week of discord, Trump will outline  plans for trade, taxes, regulation and energy policy. His plans include proposing a 15 percent corporate tax rate, an idea that is on his website. The current federal rate is 35 percent.
Senior aides and supporters said in television appearances on Sunday that Trump wanted to put behind him his disputes of last week with Republican Party leaders and the parents of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq.With the economy a major issue, Clinton on Thursday lays out a plan of her own for the ""biggest investment in good-paying jobs since World War Two,"" her campaign said.A Democrat like President Barack Obama, Clinton will be buoyed by figures released on Friday showing U.S. employment rose more than expected for a second month in a row in July and wages picked up, bolstering expectations of faster economic growth.
Clinton has pledged that no family should pay more than 10 percent of its income on childcare. She has called for a tax cut to help middle-class parents cope with rising childcare costs and an expansion of a federally funded program that provides education and health services to low-income families with young children.In a phone call lasting little more than an hour on Sunday and run by some of Trump's most senior aides, members of his newly announced economic advisory group shared their views on policy, said banker Stephen Calk, one of the members who took part.
The Clinton campaign has criticized Trump over the advisory group, announced on Friday, for including no women and relying on members who come from hedge funds and investment banking, a make-up at odds somewhat with Trump's populist message.Calk, chief executive of Federal Savings Bank and National Bancorp Holdings, said Trump had asked advisory group members to nominate women and minorities who could be added to the group. He said there were some ""big, recognizable"" names on the call who would be announced soon as joining the team but did not elaborate.A new Washington Post-ABC News opinion poll on Sunday showed Trump trailing Clinton by 8 percentage points after her party's convention in Philadelphia. A Reuters/Ipsos poll out on Friday showed the race closer three months ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election.

By Jon Herskovitz

Helen Delich Bentley, a former journalist and a U.S. Republican congresswoman from Maryland who gained global attention by smashing Japanese goods to protest Tokyo's trade policies, died over the weekend at the age of 92, officials said.Bentley upset a longtime Democratic congressman to win a U.S. House of Representatives seat in 1984, a year in which Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in the presidential race helped bring several new faces from the party to Congress.The five-term congresswoman was a staunch advocate for the port of Baltimore and the state's maritime industry.
After reports that Japanese company Toshiba had sold technology to the Soviet Union to help their submarines sail more quietly, she led other members of Congress who used a sledgehammer to smash Japanese-made goods on the Capitol steps. The event came as tensions were running high with Tokyo over a widening U.S. trade deficit with the country. She left Congress to run for governor of Maryland but lost in the party's primary.
""Congresswoman Bentley worked with tenacity, energy, and passion on behalf of her constituents, making her a rare breed in politics and a role model to public servants across Maryland,"" current Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, wrote in a Facebook post.Bentley was born in 1923 in Nevada and her parents were immigrants from Yugoslavia. After earning a bachelor's degree in journalism, she found a job with the Baltimore Sun, beginning a three-decade long relationship with the newspaper in which she wrote ground-breaking stories on the maritime industry and labor, according to her congressional biography.
She died on Saturday at her home in Timonium, a Baltimore suburb, the Baltimore Sun reported, adding Bentley had been diagnosed with brain cancer. (Reporting by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Alexandra Hudson)"	['Bentley']	[]

| WINDHAM, N.H.

WINDHAM, N.H. Republican Donald Trump on Saturday ended a tough week for his campaign in the state that launched him toward the presidential nomination and he did what Republicans have been urging him to do: Keep the focus on Democrat Hillary Clinton.""Her greatest achievement is getting out of trouble,"" Trump told supporters.Trump's victory in the Feb. 10 Republican primary in New Hampshire put him in position to win the party's nomination, but he trails Clinton in the state by 15 points in the latest WBUR/MassINC poll, 47 percent to 32 percent.Trump came to New Hampshire after a troubled week in which he tangled with fellow Republican leaders and sparred verbally with the parents of a Muslim soldier who died fighting for the United States in Iraq in 2004.Clinton, getting a lift from the Democratic National Convention, took advantage of Trump's stumbles to surge into the lead in national polls and in many battleground states. 
Now Trump has begun heeding the advice of Republican officials who say he needs to take the fight to Clinton to give the party a chance to win the White House on Nov. 8.Trump seized on Clinton's comments Friday that she had ""short-circuited"" when she said a week ago that FBI Director James Comey had said she had been truthful to the American people in her use of a private email server while U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.
In fact, Comey had concluded that Clinton was ""extremely careless"" with classified emails. He directly contradicted many of the statements Clinton had made about her use of the server.Trump spent the lion's share of a campaign speech in a crowded high school gymnasium to go after Clinton on the subject in trying to raise questions about her trustworthiness.""I think the people of this country don't want somebody who is going to short circuit,"" Trump said.
Trump also sought to turn the tables on Clinton, who has consistently accused the New York developer of being temperamentally unfit to be president.""She is a totally unhinged person,"" Trump said. (Reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by James Dalgleish)"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

By Doina Chiacu and Steve Holland
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON If Mike Pence had any doubts about what life would be like on the 2016 Republican presidential ticket with Donald Trump, the past week will have erased them: He is the damage control guy.The Indiana governor who swore off political mudslinging years ago heard Trump call Democratic rival Hillary Clinton ""the devil"" and watched him fan the flames of a feud with the parents of a Muslim soldier who died saving U.S. troops in Iraq.Unlike many vice presidential running mates, the mild-mannered Pence was not tapped as the attack dog in the Nov. 8  presidential election. Trump has that part down pat.Pence's job is harder: softening Trump's rough edges and limiting the fallout from what many Republicans see as the nominee's self-inflicted wounds.A week ago, for example, Pence rowed back on Trump's blacklist of some media outlets, saying the campaign is discussing changing course.Last Sunday, as Trump's dispute with the parents of slain U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan boiled over, Pence issued a statement praising the soldier as an ""American hero"" and saying that his family ""should be cherished by every American.""    On Wednesday, Pence offered his own endorsement to House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican, after Trump infuriated many party leaders by declining to endorse Ryan in his re-election bid.Pence, who swore off negative campaigning after losing a vituperative congressional race in 1990, eschews name calling. Trump, by contrast, delights in using monikers such as ""Crooked Hillary"" and ""the devil"" to describe Clinton.Trump has made clear he values Pence, telling a rally on Thursday in Portland, Maine, that he and his running mate have a ""great relationship.""
But Pence must walk a fine line.Even as he defuses Trump's verbal bombs, Pence must be careful to show he knows who is boss. He also has to stick to his own principles while not appearing to be trying to undermine the man who chose him as his No. 2.Should Trump win, Pence, a former congressman, could serve as a conduit to the U.S. Congress. But if Trump loses, Pence could emerge as a possible White House contender for 2020.Republican strategist Charlie Black said Pence has shown some political deftness.""He should have expected he would do some of this and provide more of the even-tempered, articulate, measured responses,"" Black said.
But Republican strategist Ryan Williams said Pence is in an ""impossible spot"" and said that Trump's missteps could cast a shadow over his running mate's political future.    ""Mike Pence is a good Republican but unfortunately he will be associated with the controversies that have ensnared the Trump-Pence ticket and will be tied to whatever the consequences of this election are,""  Williams said.POSITIVE PENCE, TESTY TRUMP

    Trump's off-the-cuff insults and controversial proposals, such as a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and a plan to build a wall along the Mexican border to keep illegal immigrants out, have made many in the party establishment uneasy.The Republican nominee's feud with the Khan family made for an awkward moment for Pence at a campaign event in Carson City, Nevada. A military mother asked Pence how could he tolerate Trump's disrespect for the armed forces, which prompted boos.Pence admonished the crowd to tone it down. ""Folks, that's what freedom looks like and that's what freedom sounds like,"" he said before calling Humayun Khan an American hero.Pence was asked on Thursday by an 11-year-old boy at a North Carolina rally if his role was ""softening up"" Trump's policies and words.Pence replied that he and Trump were ""shoulder to shoulder"" in the campaign.Christopher Devine, co-author of the book ""The VP Advantage"" and an assistant political science professor at the University of Dayton in Ohio, said that if Trump loses the November election, Pence may try to position himself as a conservative bridge between Trump supporters and traditional Republicans. That may be an added reason for Pence's cautious approach.""He has to be very careful about how he handles the defense of Donald Trump,"" Devine said.

WASHINGTON The Obama administration released a redacted version of President Barack Obama's once-secret policy on drone strikes abroad following a freedom of information lawsuit filed last year, the American Civil Liberties Union said on Saturday.The release of the 18-page Presidential Policy Guidance document, as well as other Department of Defense papers, follows an order by a U.S. District Court judge in February requiring the Justice Department to disclose the document, also known as ""the Playbook.""It sets out the law and rules the government must follow when carrying out targeted killings and the capture of terrorist suspects abroad. Obama pledged in 2013 to provide greater transparency about counter-terrorism operations, including drone strikes overseas, amid calls by some U.S. lawmakers and rights groups for more openness.  ACLU's deputy legal director, Jameel Jaffer, welcomed the release of the documents, saying they provide new details about policy standards and insights into the process for targeting individuals with lethal force or for capture.""Its release now will inform an ongoing debate about the lawfulness and wisdom of the government's counter-terrorism policies,"" Jaffer said in a statement.
The ACLU's lawsuit sought information, among other things, on the law and policies used to justify lethal force and how the government picks targets.According to the documents, published by the ACLU, strikes against high-value terrorist targets can be taken ""when there is near certainty"" that the person is present, and that no civilians will be injured or killed, and is necessary to ""achieve U.S. policy objectives"".
The administration has defended its use of drones as essential in fighting al Qaeda and other militants in countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen. Some drone strikes have killed civilians who were not targets, igniting local anger.""The president has emphasized that the U.S. Government should be as transparent as possible with the American people about our counter-terrorism operations, the manner in which they are conducted, and their results,"" National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said of Saturday's release of documents.""Our counter-terrorism actions are effective and legal, and their legitimacy is best demonstrated by making public more information about these actions as well as setting clear standards for other nations to follow,"" he added.
Naureen Shah, Amnesty International's U.S. director for security and human rights, also welcomed the documents but said more was needed to ensure the policy was followed.""The Obama administration's disclosures are welcome but they only tell part of the story and obscure disturbing practices. We still know extremely little about the standards that would govern signature strikes and so-called rescuer strikes, which have involved potentially unlawful killings,"" Shah added.

By Emily Stephenson and James Oliphant
| GREEN BAY, Wis./WASHINGTON

GREEN BAY, Wis./WASHINGTON Republican Donald Trump acted to steer his White House campaign back into favor with his party's establishment on Friday by endorsing U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and two Republican senators seeking re-election, after expressing coolness toward them earlier this week.""I need a Republican Senate and a House to accomplish all of the changes that we have to make,"" Trump said during a rally in Green Bay, in northern Wisconsin, Ryan's home state. He also endorsed Senators John McCain of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, calling Ayotte a ""rising star.""""We will have disagreements, but we will disagree as friends,"" Trump said, Trump earlier this week refused to endorse Ryan, telling The Washington Post he was ""not quite there yet"" - nearly the same phrase Ryan had used about Trump before finally endorsing him. Trump said in the same interview that McCain had not done enough for veterans and criticized Ayotte for distancing herself from him during the campaign.Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican, had no plans to attend the Wisconsin event, a sign of lingering frictions between the pair, even though Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, did endorse him. Ryan's Republican primary challenger, businessman Paul Nehlen, did attend, according to a spokesman.Ryan is expected to win the challenge for his House seat in next week's Republican primary, and he is viewed by many Republicans as a possible presidential candidate in the future. The tension between Ryan and Trump caused deep frustration among party leaders and lawmakers.Trump's endorsement came as one of several steps to get his campaign back on track after days of controversy and falling poll numbers that have given Democrat Hillary Clinton the advantage in the race to the Nov. 8 election.In the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday, Clinton's lead over Trump narrowed to less than 3 percentage points, down from nearly 8 points on Monday.Trump said on Friday he wanted a ""big tent"" party with multiple viewpoints welcome. He said he was endorsing the Republican lawmakers due to their ""shared mission to make America great again.""Trump also announced a new advisory team to help guide him on economic policy. The group relies heavily on hedge fund managers and investment bankers, a group Trump has railed against. There are no women on the team.Trump plans to release his economic policy framework in a speech in Detroit on Monday, an event that will offer him a chance to avoid theatrics and detail how he would handle economic issues if elected.
Trump economic adviser Stephen Moore told Reuters that the candidate's plan would focus on four areas: tax, deregulation, energy policy and trade. ""It's going to be an all-encompassing look at how we reform the economy,"" Moore said.At events in Des Moines, Iowa, and Green Bay, Trump showed discipline that is unusual at his often free-wheeling rallies, calling Clinton the ""queen of corruption"" and defending himself against her charge that he is temperamentally unfit for the White House.""All my life I've been told, 'You have the greatest temperament,'"" he said in Des Moines. He also said voters should consider supporting him because of Pence, who appeared with him at both events.""If you don't like me, that's okay. Vote for Pence because it's the same thing,"" Trump said.Trump bashed the media as well, saying reporters over-hyped an incident earlier in the week and claimed he kicked a baby out of an event in Virginia. ""I love babies,"" he said.
""SHORT-CIRCUITED""
Clinton sought to take advantage of Trump's dip in the polls at a conference of minority journalists in Washington, where she pledged an all-out fight for comprehensive immigration reform.And she did what she has rarely done during the presidential campaign: take questions from reporters.She addressed two of the largest issues that continue to dog her campaign: the controversy over her use of a private email server while she was U.S. secretary of state and continuing skepticism among voters about her trustworthiness.Clinton conceded that she had ""short-circuited"" earlier in the week in interviews when she had asserted that FBI director James Comey had concluded that she had been truthful in her statements about use of the private server. Clinton had repeatedly said she never sent emails containing classified material, a finding that Comey contradicted at the conclusion of the FBI's probe in July, when he rebuked her for ""extremely careless"" handling of classified information while recommending that no criminal charges be filed.
On Friday, Clinton maintained, ""I never sent or received anything marked classified,"" while acknowledging that some material she sent may retroactively have been considered classified by other government agencies.Republicans have repeatedly charged that Clinton endangered national security with her handling of classified material.The email controversy has fueled a perception among a majority of voters that Clinton is untrustworthy. ""I take it seriously,"" she said. Still, as she has often done during her career, Clinton attributed much of her low standing on this issue to attacks from Republicans.FINANCE AND INDUSTRY LEADERS 
Trump's campaign said his economic advisory panel included former steel executive Dan DiMicco; Howard Lorber, CEO of tobacco company Vector Group Ltd (VGR.N); and Trump campaign finance chairman and investment manager Steven Mnuchin. Hedge fund managers John Paulson and Steve Feinberg, Moore, the Trump economic adviser, and David Malpass, who has served in previous Republican administrations, were also named.Trump's moves came after many Republicans urged the candidate to correct course following a tumultuous week.The real estate mogul and former reality television star was  caught up for days in a public spat with the parents of a Muslim  American soldier killed in Iraq. The parents had criticized Trump at last week's Democratic National Convention. Many Republicans, including Ryan, McCain and Ayotte, were critical of Trump's insistent attacks on the pair.

By Grant Smith
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's lead over Republican rival Donald Trump narrowed to less than 3 percentage points, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Friday, down from nearly eight points on Monday.About 42 percent of likely voters favored Clinton, to Trump's 39 percent, according to the July 31-Aug. 4 online poll of 1,154 likely voters. The poll had a credibility interval of plus or minus 3 percentage points, meaning that the results suggest the race is roughly even.Among registered voters over the same period, Clinton held a lead of five percentage points, down from eight percentage points on Monday, according to the poll. 
The reasons behind the shift were unclear. Clinton had pulled well ahead of Trump on the heels of the Democratic National Convention last week, where she became the first woman to accept the U.S. presidential nomination from a major political party. 
Since then, Trump has engaged in a days-long feud with the family of an American soldier killed in Iraq and squabbled with the Republican leadership over his comments and leadership turmoil within his campaign.Trump, in recent days, however, has sought to refocus. On Friday he announced his economic policy advisory team, said he would deliver an economic policy speech early next week, and was expected to endorse U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican, who is seeking his 10th term in Congress.
An average of polls aggregated by Real Clear Politics showed Clinton ahead of Trump by 6.8 percentage points on Friday, up from 3.9 on Aug. 1. (Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Leslie Adler)"	['Paul', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Friday announced his team of economic advisers, among whom are a hedge fund manager, a former top steel executive and a former high-ranking U.S. government official. Trump said he would deliver a speech on his economic policy plan on Monday.Here are some facts on the members of his economic team:JOHN PAULSON, HEDGE FUND MANAGER
Paulson is best known on Wall Street for his bet against the overheated housing market in 2007 that netted him and his investors billions of dollars in profits. But Paulson's calls on stocks and the economy have been less accurate lately. His investments have lost some $15 billion in assets in the last five years, leaving his Paulson & Co Inc hedge fund with roughly $13 billion at the end of June. He is known for making contrarian bets and being patient. He has been one of only a handful of hedge fund managers to have publicly endorsed Trump. Many others have said privately that they are still on the fence or leaning toward his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.STEVE FEINBERG, PRIVATE EQUITY FUND MANAGER 
Feinberg is chief executive officer of Cerberus Capital Management LP, a private equity firm he co-founded in 1992. He headed the investment firm during its failed takeover of automaker Chrysler in 2007. The investment firm served as Chrysler's majority owner until the troubled car maker was restructured in a government-sponsored bankruptcy in 2009.Feinberg had promised to revive the company, according to a New York Times profile, but instead lost billions. (here) Feinberg has defended his role to try to save the carmaker. He ultimately had to appeal to Washington for help.     DAVID MALPASS, FORMER TREASURY, STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL
Malpass served under two previous Republican administrations, first as a deputy assistant Treasury secretary for President Ronald Reagan and later as a deputy assistant secretary of State for President George H.W. Bush.        Malpass, in a CNBC interview on Friday, called for greater infrastructure spending as well as tax cuts, trade reform, regulatory reform and energy reform, although he gave few specifics. ""We need more effective spending and Trump wants to do that - to have stronger finances for the country,"" he said.Malpass has been a vocal critic of the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy since the financial crisis, in particular its large bond holdings.Malpass, who was also previously chief economist at investment bank Bear Stearns, now runs Encima Global Llc, an investment consulting firm. PETER NAVARRO, PROFESSOR
    Navarro is the only adviser on the list with a doctorate in economics and the only one who has spent most of his life as an academic. He earned his doctorate at Harvard University and is now a professor of economics and public policy at the University of California, Irvine's business school.Navarro has written nine books, three of them critical about China's effect on the rest of the world, including ""Death by China: Confronting the Dragon - A Global Call to Action."" He thinks the United States should be tougher on trade and intellectual property theft and has proposed slapping a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports.
    Navarro recently wrote in an opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times that Trump would crack down on any country ""that cheats on its trade deals using practices such as currency manipulation and illegal export subsidies."" (here)HOWARD LORBER, HOLDING COMPANY CEO
Lorber is president and CEO of holding company Vector Group Ltd (VGR.N), whose three subsidiaries make cigarettes as well as e-cigarettes. Vector also operates two real estate subsidiaries: a real estate investment company and a real estate brokerage firm. A fellow New Yorker, Trump's campaign has mentioned Lorber as one of Trump's best friends. (here)The two traveled together to Russia in the 1990s, according to news reports.STEVEN MNUCHIN, INVESTMENT MANAGER
A former partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc who now works in entertainment financing, Mnuchin is chairman and CEO of private investment firm Dune Capital Management LP. Trump named Mnuchin, who had a long history of political donations to Democrats, including to Hillary Clinton, as his finance chair in May.
Mnuchin has said he has had a personal and professional relationship with Trump for more than 15 years. DAN DIMICCO, FORMER STEEL EXECUTIVE
DiMicco is the former chief executive and executive chairman of steel producer Nucor Corp (NUE.N), one of the biggest U.S. steelmakers.His outspoken push for tougher U.S. trade policies to support domestic manufacturing and his fierce anti-China rhetoric have made him one of the most high-profile executives in the steel industry.In recent years, he has taken his campaign for new trade rules online and has publicly endorsed Trump's call for a tougher approach on trade. ""You don't win a Trade War with appeasement or more Free Trade agreements,"" DiMicco wrote in a July 10 blog post on his website, www.dandimicco.com. STEPHEN MOORE, FOUNDER, CLUB FOR GROWTH
Moore is one of the leading conservative economic voices in the United States. He embraces tax cuts as key to economic growth, as well as free trade and immigration reform.Moore founded the anti-tax advocacy group Club for Growth, where he served until he left the organization in 2004. He later served as a member of The Wall Street Journal editorial board.     
He is currently a fellow at the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, focusing on economic growth. TOM BARRACK, REAL ESTATE FINANCIER
Barrack is a longtime friend of Trump and a fellow hotel developer.He is the founder and executive chairman of private equity firm Colony Capital Inc (CLNY.N) and is co-chairman of the board of trustees of Colony Starwood Homes (SFR.N).Barrack spoke out in favor of Trump at the Republican National Convention in July, but afterwards his company announced it was dropping out of Trump's Old Post Office hotel project in Washington, according to a report in The Washington Post.

8	8	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-economy-idUSKCN10G2IO	Trump's economic advisory group clashes with populist image	"


By James Oliphant
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's team of economic policy advisers is packed with moguls from the hedge fund and investment banking industries that he has railed against in the past.And none of them are women - a demographic group he needs to court if he hopes to win in November.Trump's campaign has been powered by a populist message that criticizes corporate America for outsourcing jobs, profiting at the expense of everyday workers and buying influence in Washington. The message resonates best with middle-class and working-class voters buffeted by the forces of globalization. But among the members of the 13-member team of advisers announced on Friday are hedge-fund billionaire John Paulson and investment bankers Steve Feinberg and Andy Beal, as well as a former top steel executive and a former high-ranking U.S. government official. ""It is a hallowed campaign tradition. Malign an industry, but court its wealthy big shots,"" said Erik Gordon, a professor of law and business at the University of Michigan.The reliance on Wall Street executives comes after Trump spent much of his primary campaign lambasting the industry for paying too little in taxes. ""The hedge fund guys are getting away with murder,"" Trump said in an interview last year.One of the best known of Trump's panel is Paulson, whose bet against the overheated housing market in 2007 netted him and his investors billions of dollars. His bets have since gone the other way, losing some $15 billion in the last five years.Don Steinbrugge, managing partner at investment consulting firm Agecroft Partners LLC, said Trump could benefit from his advisers' expertise on global capital markets if he ""would listen to them.""
Whether Trump will heed the counsel of his conservative-leaning economic advisers or steer his own course was also raised by Lanhee Chen, who served as a top policy aide to Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in 2012. ""It's hard to see a consistent strain of conservative economic thought,"" Chen said, citing Trump's protectionist policies on trade as an example of where Trump differs from the Republican party's free-market economic orthodoxy.The panel also includes former steel executive Dan DiMicco; oil magnate Harold Hamm; Howard Lorber, the CEO of tobacco company Vector Group Ltd; Trump campaign finance chairman Steven Mnuchin, a former partner at Goldman Sachs who is now chairman and CEO of private investment firm Dune Capital Management LP; and David Malpass, a former official of the U.S. Treasury and State departments.James Pethokoukis, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, noted the absence of representatives from the tech and venture capital sectors. ""If I was assembling a task force to analyze the big challenges facing the American economy and to develop solutions, I am not sure that a group like this would naturally spring to mind,"" he said.
But the panel fits with the themes of Trump's campaign in another way. Trump often has boasted about bringing in successful business people to tackle Washington's entrenched problems, and many of Trump's supporters see his background in business as among his biggest assets.GUY WITH A BINDER
Some critics seized upon the lack of women on Trump's panel. After being asked this week to identify women he might appoint to his cabinet if elected, Trump could only respond with the name of his daughter Ivanka. 
Democratic rival Hillary Clinton hit Trump on the comment in a Twitter post, comparing him to Romney who, when asked a similar question during his campaign, said he'd reviewed ""binders full of women.""""We know a guy with a binder, @realDonaldTrump. (He might not take your calls, though.)"" Clinton's campaign wrote. The campaign declined to comment on Trump's advisers.Trump has struggled with women voters since his campaign began. Some 65 percent of women have an unfavorable view of Trump, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, compared with 53 percent who have an unfavorable view of Clinton.Kellyanne Conway, a pollster who works for the Trump campaign, said the emphasis on gender on the economic team is misplaced. Women voters, she said, care more about their economic well-being than the make-up of an advisory group.""What female voters wish to know is whose economic plan will be better for them,"" she said.

""FEC (Federal Election Commission) rules would limit that activity if Mr. Icahn were to become directly involved in the campaign by joining the council,"" Lynn said.There was no immediate comment from the Trump campaign.Trump announced his economic advisory team on Friday, and said he would release his plan to boost the U.S. economy in a speech on Monday.Trump has floated Icahn's name for U.S. Treasury secretary if he was elected president. Icahn, 80, has repeatedly rejected the notion of accepting such an offer.
Lynn did not give any details on what kind of regulatory reforms a new Super PAC may target.In September, Icahn released a video titled ""Danger Ahead,"" in which he endorsed Trump for president and criticized the Federal Reserve for creating a new bubble in the corporate bond market.BEST OF BIZ:Reuters Investigates: Big coal summoned Wall Street and faced a whirlwind

Much of this debt is sold to ""Mom and Pop"" investors via exchange-traded funds, a popular vehicle for trading baskets of bonds and stocks.In October, Icahn announced his first Super PAC, which was the biggest one-time injection of money in the history of such political action committees. Icahn said the incentive for companies to leave the United States via inversion deals could be eliminated by legislation allowing big companies to repatriate funds held offshore at a discounted tax rate - an approach also favored by Trump.A Wall Street veteran, Icahn made his fortune buying stakes in companies such as RJR Nabisco, Texaco, Phillips Petroleum, Lions Gate Entertainment Corp, Netflix Inc, Apple Inc and eBay Inc and pushing their management to change their strategies.
