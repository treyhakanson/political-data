In fact ... this last week I took a physical and .... when the numbers come in I'll be releasing very, very specific numbers.""

By Joseph Ax
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Would-be presidential assassin John Hinckley Jr. was released from a psychiatric hospital on Saturday, media reports said, 35 years after he shot U.S. President Ronald Reagan in an attack prompted by a deranged obsession with the actress Jodie Foster.Hinckley, 61, is moving in with his elderly mother in a gated community in Williamsburg, Virginia, where he has been making increasingly long furlough visits in recent years under the watchful eyes of the U.S. Secret Service.A federal judge in July ordered Hinckley's release from St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington, finding that he no longer posed a danger to himself or to others. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity at a 1982 trial and was diagnosed with depression and psychosis, both of which are now in remission, according to his doctors.Local media, including The Washington Post, reported that Hinckley was officially released from St. Elizabeth's on Saturday, when he had been scheduled to be freed. A hospital employee who answered the phone on Saturday said she could not comment on patients to the media.Residents of the town have seemed largely unfazed by the prospect of Hinckley's release, though some have expressed wariness.
As a 25-year-old college dropout, Hinckley had grown fixated upon Foster and the Martin Scorsese film ""Taxi Driver,"" in which she played a teenage prostitute.Inspired by the film's main character, who plots to kill a presidential candidate, Hinckley opened fire on Reagan outside a Washington, D.C., hotel on March 30, 1981, in a misguided effort to win Foster's affections.
Reagan suffered a punctured lung but recovered quickly. His press secretary, James Brady, was left permanently disabled and eventually died of his injuries in 2014.The shooting left its mark in a number of ways. The Brady shooting helped launch the modern gun control movement, and a 1993 bill named after him imposed background checks and a waiting period.Hinckley's verdict, meanwhile, led several states to rewrite their laws to make insanity defenses more difficult, and the Secret Service toughened its security procedures following the assassination attempt.
Hinckley's release has dozens of conditions attached, including a requirement that he work or volunteer at least three days a week, limit his travel, allow law enforcement to track his movements and continue meeting with a psychiatrist.The Reagan family issued a statement in July strongly opposing Hinckley's release. Foster has declined to comment on Hinckley since 1981. (Reporting by Joseph Ax; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)"

By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Republican Donald Trump appears to have carved out a wider path to the White House as a number of states including Florida and Ohio are no longer considered likely wins for Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project released on Saturday.The project, which combines opinion polls with an analysis of voting patterns under different election scenarios, still shows Clinton would have the best chance of winning the presidency if the Nov. 8 election were held today. Yet Trump has caught up to her level of support in several states.Clinton now has an 83 percent chance of winning the election by an average of 47 votes in the Electoral College, the body that ultimately selects the president. In late August, the States of the Nation estimated that Clinton had a 95 percent chance of winning by an average of 108 electoral votes.Over the past few weeks, Clinton's lead in the national polls has slipped considerably. Polls tend to narrow as  Election Day nears, and the Clinton campaign has struggled to overcome controversy about how she handled classified information while serving as secretary of state.
A separate Reuters/Ipsos poll of likely voters showed an 8-point lead for Clinton has vanished since the last week of August.   Clinton is still favored to win 17 states, including many with large, urban populations such as New York, New Jersey and California that heavily influence the outcome of the election. Trump would likely win 23 states, many of them with smaller populations.The number of states projected for Clinton has dropped over the past few weeks. Two of those states, Ohio and Florida, were considered likely wins for Clinton in late August. Now the candidates are about even in support. Five more states, including Michigan and North Carolina are also up for grabs. 
The sample size was insufficient to determine the outcome in Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska and the District of Columbia, though Alaska usually votes Republican and Washington D.C. for the Democratic Party candidate.The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project is driven by an online survey that gathers responses from about 15,000 people per week. Their responses are weighted according to the latest population estimates, and each respondent is ranked according to their likelihood to vote. 
Once the poll is complete, the project tallies the levels of support and estimated error for both candidates, and then runs multiple election simulations given their respective support.

By Steve Holland and Jeff Mason
| WASHINGTON/NEW YORK

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton clashed over national security again on Friday, with Trump calling his Democratic rival ""trigger-happy"" and Clinton arguing his proposals would make the world a more dangerous place.The two White House hopefuls have waged a running battle this week over who is best placed to command the world's most powerful military, with both touting their support from retired military leaders and attacking their opponent's temperament and judgment.Trump also injected drama into the national security debate this week by wholeheartedly endorsing Russian President Vladimir Putin as a strong leader who has fared better than U.S. President Barack Obama. Clinton, many Democrats and even some in his own Republican party balked.  Trump, speaking on Friday at the conservative Value Voters summit in Washington, painted Clinton as a ""massive failure"" while she was America's top diplomat from 2009 to early 2013, blaming her for the current turmoil in the Middle East.""The problem is, Hillary Clinton is trigger-happy. Her tenure has brought us only war, destruction and death. She's just too quick to intervene, invade, or to push for regime change,"" he said at the summit.Meanwhile in New York, Clinton met with national security and foreign policy experts who are supporting her campaign to discuss terrorism. She touted the bipartisan nature of the meeting and vowed to work across the aisle as president to tackle national security challenges.""The nominee on the other side promises to do things that will make us less safe,"" Clinton told reporters at a news conference on Friday afternoon. ""National security experts on both sides of the aisle are chilled by what they're hearing from the Republican nominee.""Both candidates are hoping to capitalize on concerns about national security and paint their opponents as unqualified leading into the Nov. 8 presidential election.
WORKING WITH THE RUSSIANS
Trump's speech on Friday comes after the candidate took the unusual step of criticizing U.S. policy in a program aired on Thursday night on Russian government-funded television network, RT, a 24-hour news channel that broadcasts in both English and Russian. He said he disagreed with the U.S. decision to invade Iraq in 2003 and that Obama botched the withdrawal.""It's a war we shouldn't have been in, number one,"" Trump said in the interview. ""And it's a war that, when we got out, we got out the wrong way. That's Obama.""Critics of the network, which mostly targets audiences outside of Russia, have described it as a propaganda arm of  Putin's government.
American presidential candidates are not prone to condemn  their country before a foreign audience, even if they are fierce critics of the current administration while campaigning in the United States. Trump has said far worse about Obama in appearances on U.S. television networks.Clinton blasted Trump for appearing on the network and praising Putin, as he had done on Wednesday night during a televised national security forum. ""Every day that goes by this just becomes more and more of a reality television show,"" Clinton said. ""It's not a serious presidential campaign, and it is beyond one's imagination to have a candidate for president praising a Russian autocrat like Vladimir Putin.""The White House said it had no comment on Trump's remarks. The New York businessman also said on RT on Thursday he did not think Russia's government was behind the hack of Democratic National Committee email servers, and doubted it was trying to interfere in the U.S. election. Experts inside and outside the government have pointed to Russian-backed actors as the source of the hack, which has been used to leak information in an attempt to embarrass Democrats.
Trump, in his speech on Friday, stuck to his belief that the United States and Russia can work together to defeat Islamic State militants. He said any nation that wants to join the United States against ISIS is welcome.""That includes Russia,"" he said. ""If they want to join us in knocking out ISIS, that's just fine as far as I'm concerned.""   Trump also sought on Friday to blame Clinton after reports that North Korea had tested a nuclear weapon, arguing it was the fourth such test since the Democrat became secretary of state in 2009 and that she should have ended the nation's nuclear program before her tenure ended.""It's just one more massive failure from a failed secretary of state,"" Trump said.Clinton called the North Korea test ""outrageous and unacceptable,"" saying she supports imposing additional U.S. and United Nations sanctions.""It will be on the top of my list in dealing with China on how we're going to prevent what could very well be a serious conflict with North Korea,"" she said.

By Luciana Lopez and Jeff Mason
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Saturday said she regretted saying ""half"" of Republican rival Donald Trump's supporters belonged in a ""basket of deplorables,"" but made no apologies for calling out ""prejudice and paranoia"" among Trump's campaign and supporters.""Last night I was 'grossly generalistic,' and that's never a good idea. I regret saying 'half' - that was wrong,"" Clinton said in a statement, the day after comments at a fundraiser in New York.But ""Trump has built his campaign largely on prejudice and paranoia,"" she said, adding: ""I won't stop calling out bigotry and racist rhetoric in this campaign.""Republicans and Trump supporters responded fiercely on social media to Clinton's remarks at the LGBT fundraiser and the episode threatened to distract from her efforts to paint Trump as unqualified for the presidency. But Trump on Saturday sought to use Clinton's comments to make the same charge about her.""How can she be President of our country when she has such contempt and disdain for so many great Americans?"" a Trump  statement asked.""Hillary Clinton should be ashamed of herself, and this proves beyond a doubt that she is unfit and incapable to serve as President of the United States,"" he added. At Friday night's fundraiser, Clinton said Trump had given voice to hateful rhetoric through his behavior as a candidate for the White House in the Nov. 8 election. ""To just be grossly generalistic, you can put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the 'basket of deplorables,'"" Clinton said. ""Unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up."" Some of those were irredeemable, she said, but they did not represent America.The other basket of Trump's supporters constituted individuals desperate for change who felt let down by the government and the economy, Clinton added.
""They don't buy everything he says, but he seems to hold out some hope that their lives will be different,"" Clinton said.  ""Those are people we have to understand and empathize with, as well.""Trump's campaign hammered on Clinton throughout the day.""Hillary Clinton's low opinion of the people that support this campaign should be denounced in the strongest possible terms,"" Mike Pence, the governor of Indiana and Trump's running mate, said at the Values Voter Summit in Washington.""So let me just say from the bottom of my heart: Hillary, they are not a basket of anything. They are Americans, and they deserve your respect.""Trump, a New York businessman who has never run for political office before, regularly says things that some consider insulting, racist or off-color. On Friday night, he told supporters in Pensacola, Florida, that Clinton could shoot someone and not be prosecuted.""Because she's being so protected, she could walk into this arena right now and shoot somebody with 20,000 people watching right smack in the middle of the heart and she wouldn't be prosecuted, okay?"" he said. [nL1N1BM031]  
But Clinton's remarks got top billing on Twitter where the  hashtag #BasketOfDeplorables was trending, with shows of  condemnation and support for Clinton.Twitter user Basketeer Vendetta, under the account Vendetta92429, tweeted a photo of Trump supporters wearing campaign T-shirts and hats, adding: ""Proud to be part of the #BasketOfDeplorables with my fellow Americans.""And Trump himself tweeted: ""Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls!""But some Twitter users agreed with Clinton, referencing  remarks by Trump that have been called racist, such as when he described some Mexican immigrants drug dealers and rapists.RISKY COMMENT 

Clinton's comment could nevertheless end up being a boon to Trump.""As long as Trump stays out of the way and doesn't overshadow Hillary's comment, her 'basket of deplorables' comment should dominate the media in the coming days and runs the risk of negatively defining her campaign,"" said Republican strategist Doug Heye.Republican strategist Ana Navarro, who has been highly critical of Trump, said Clinton might have crossed an important line.""When you are running for President, you are running to represent all Americans, even the ones you think are deplorable,"" said Navarro.But Jamal Simmons, a Democratic consultant, said the remarks probably would not wrest voters from Clinton.""We're moving to the part of the election process where there's a lot less persuasion of new voters and more persuasion of the people who like you to turn out and work to elect you,"" he added.Many of Clinton's fundraisers have been closed to the media, but not the one on Friday night.  Some critics likened Clinton's observation to 2012 Republican candidate Mitt Romney's ""47 percent"" comment in which he said 47 percent of voters are dependent upon the government and would vote for President Barack Obama no matter what. His campaign struggled to recover after the remark leaked. But Democratic strategist Jim Manley, who supports Clinton, pointed out that Romney was talking about all voters, and Clinton was specifically describing Trump supporters.

The Democratic National Committee on Friday said it settled part of a federal lawsuit over the actions of Arizona poll officials during the presidential primary that caused voters long waits and critics said disenfranchised some, especially minorities.  The suit, filed in April in U.S. District Court in Arizona, targeted the decision to sharply cut polling locations in Maricopa County, causing waits of up to five hours for those casting ballots during the March 22 primary.""This is a great victory for Arizonans, and for our democracy,"" Donna Brazile, interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement. ""We know that long lines depress turnout.""Representatives for the Maricopa County Board of Directors, the Maricopa County Recorder's Office and the Secretary of State did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The election had been mired in controversy from the outset, with polling sites cut to 60, down from 200 in 2012, in a move that officials said was designed to cut costs.
County officials were quick to take blame for the cuts, saying they misjudged voter turnout, based on recent history and increasing mail-in votes. Maricopa County miscalculated voter turnout and underestimated the number of vote centers needed for the March presidential primaries, the Democratic National Committee said in the statement.
As part of the settlement, Maricopa County election officials agreed to consider the Democrats' recommendations on polling place queuing and the use of electronic management systems, a copy of the agreement showed. The Democratic nominating contest for the Nov. 8 presidential election was won by Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders. Both their campaigns joined the lawsuit.
The settlement has no bearing on other elements of the lawsuit, such as a challenge to a law banning organizers from collecting mail-in ballots from a voter's home for delivery to polling locations. (Reporting by Eric M. Johnson in Seattle; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)"

PENSACOLA, Fla. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump once famously said he could shoot someone on New York's Fifth Avenue and not lose voters. Now he says his rival Hillary Clinton could shoot someone in an arena in front of 20,000 people and not be prosecuted.At a rally on Friday before thousands of cheering supporters in Pensacola, Florida, Trump had more harsh words for the Democratic presidential nominee in the fallout over their crossfire at a televised national security forum in New York on Wednesday.""Because she's being so protected, she could walk into this arena right now and shoot somebody with 20,000 people watching right smack in the middle of the heart and she wouldn't be prosecuted, okay?"" he said.""That is what's happened to this country. I never thought I'd see the day where this has happened to our country,"" he added.
Trump's charge is that Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state and former U.S. senator, has profited from a ""rigged"" political system. He has repeatedly denounced the FBI's decision not to prosecute Clinton for her use of a private email server and the handling of classified information. As a newcomer to politics, Trump has used colorful language in the past to describe fervent support for him.
""I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters,"" Trump said at a campaign rally in Iowa last January.

PENSACOLA, Fla. U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed on Friday that any Iranian vessels that harass the U.S. Navy in the Gulf would be ""shot out of the water"" if he is elected on Nov. 8.Trump, at a rally before thousands of supporters in Pensacola, Florida, laid out an aggressive national security policy with a beefed-up U.S. military ""so strong that nobody's going to mess with us.""He talked tough about how he would respond to any Iranian harassment of American ships in the Gulf. A U.S. Navy coastal patrol ship changed course after an Iranian fast-attack craft came within 100 yards (91 meters) of it on Sunday. It was the fourth such incident in the past month.""When they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures at our people that they shouldn't be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water,"" he said.
Trump has based his foreign policy beliefs on keeping the United States out of what he called ""endless wars"" in the Middle East.Visiting a city with a U.S. Navy base and where many military veterans live, Trump said he wants a stronger military to project American power and bolster the United States as the leader of the world.Trump this week laid out a plan to spend many billions of dollars on bolstering the U.S. military, including more ships, planes and troops.
""We're going to put us in a position of leadership of the world again so we can negotiate from a position of great, great strength. But more important than negotiating, we will be secure again,"" he said.Trump, who has drawn criticism for his frequent praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin, also mentioned a recent incident in which a Russian fighter jet came within 10 feet (3 meters) of a U.S. Navy surveillance plane over the Black Sea.
""Putin laughs, believe me, he laughs at our leaders. Yesterday he had a plane 10 feet away, taunting us, toying with us, just like Iran,"" he said. (Reporting By Steve Holland; Editing by Tom Brown)"

WASHINGTON Donald Trump's Republican presidential campaign, widely criticized for refusing to release the candidate's tax returns, released 10 years of returns on Friday for vice presidential nominee Mike Pence.The Trump campaign also repeated a pledge that Trump would release his own returns once the government completes an audit.Pence's returns for 2006 to 2015 showed the Indiana governor and former U.S. congressman paid an effective tax rate that ranged from 10 percent to 16.5 percent.""These returns are being released with the full support of Mr. Trump who plans to release his tax returns upon completion of a routine audit,"" the campaign said.Disclosure of tax returns is a standard procedure for all modern presidential candidates. Trump's critics, including the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, have suggested he may be hiding something.
Some have speculated that Trump may pay little or no tax or that his net worth may be much less than the $10 billion he has claimed. Pence and his wife, Karen, reported adjusted gross income over the 10 years ranging from about $113,000 last year to over $187,000 in 2009, while the effective state and federal tax rate ranged from a low of just over 10 percent in 2013 to a high of 16.5 percent in 2014, the figures show. 
Charitable donations amounted to 10 percent of the family's take-home pay, equivalent to an average 7.2 percent of adjusted gross income, a statement released by the Trump campaign said.Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns last month. They showed she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent. Most of the income came from Bill Clinton's speaking fees and a book deal by Hillary.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns at the same time in August. They paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent on income of about $313,000 in 2015. (Reporting by Eric Walsh; Editing by David Gregorio)"
