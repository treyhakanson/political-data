By Jonathan Allen and Luciana Lopez
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders' tax and benefit plans would raise income for most Americans but his proposal for single-payer healthcare would help generate record federal deficits, two Washington think tanks said on Monday. An analysis by the Tax Policy Center said that although most people would pay higher taxes under Sanders' plan, the average household income would increase by nearly $4,300 in 2017 after his proposed benefits were factored in. Those benefits include an expansion of the Social Security government pension plan, paid family leave and free tuition at public colleges, ideas that have generated support for Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, as he seeks to become the Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Only the wealthiest 5 percent of households would end up paying more in new taxes than they got back in benefits, according to the center, a joint effort run by two Washington-based think tanks, the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.
But Sanders' plans would also increase federal deficits to ""unprecedented levels,"" the center said, relying largely on a new estimate of the cost of his healthcare proposals published on Monday in a separate analysis by the Urban Institute. Sanders has proposed a single-payer healthcare system, a more significant overhaul than the tweaks that Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton wants to make to the Affordable Care Act, a signature policy achievement of Democratic President Barack Obama.The Urban Institute estimated Sanders' healthcare plan would require an increase in federal spending of $32 trillion over the next decade but that new revenue sources proposed by Sanders only covered just under half of that amount. 
The overall result would be an increase in annual federal budget deficits by $18 trillion over the next decade, the Tax Policy Center said. Warren Gunnels, Sanders' policy director, called the new cost estimate ""wildly"" overestimated in a statement on Monday. He said the analyses were wrong to assume that state and local governments would stop their own spending on healthcare, thereby shifting $4.1 trillion in costs to the federal government. 
Gunnels said the reports also underestimated what the Sanders campaign forecast would be trillions of dollars in savings in administration, paperwork and drug prices seen in other Western countries with single-payer systems.The Sanders campaign has estimated that his proposed healthcare system would save more than $6 trillion over the next 10 years, compared with the current system.

By Matthew Dallek

GOP leaders have unleashed a stunning level of vitriol against their party's most successful presidential candidate.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), emphatically declared last week that he was not ready to endorse Donald Trump, his party's presumptive presidential nominee. This move was unprecedented in modern American history. Trump's response was that Ryan may need to be replaced as head of the Republican National Convention.Ryan's rebuke reminds Americans that Trump is deeply unpopular, particularly among a significant number of powerful Republicans. Former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney belittled the GOP's new leader as a moral cretin unfit to be the standard bearer. Former President George W. Bush and his father, President George H.W. Bush, both say they are not attending the GOP convention in Cleveland.Such attacks, however, are nothing new.Political elders have lambasted their party's leading presidential contenders throughout U.S. history. The big difference now is that this battle is playing out in public. In the past, attacks were largely in party backrooms, behind closed doors.To be sure, some serious breaks have been acted out in public. With dire results. President Theodore Roosevelt, for example, realized in 1912 that his progressive agenda was being abandoned by his chosen successor, William Howard Taft. TR challenged Taft in the Republican primaries. ""We stand at Armageddon,"" Roosevelt thundered at the convention, ""and we battle for the Lord!""When Taft prevailed, Roosevelt bolted the party. He ran as a third-party candidate in 1912 on a Progressive Party ticket. Ultimately, the Democratic nominee, Woodrow Wilson, won.In most other cases, however, the internecine bloodletting took place in private, preserving the appearance of party unity and making it easier to heal any rifts.
The 1944 Republican nominee Thomas Dewey ignored former President Herbert Hoover at an important state funeral that October and drew the national leader's ire. ""Dewey has no inner reservoir of knowledge on which to draw for his thinking."" Hoover sneered to a friend. ""A man couldn't wear a mustache like that without having it affect his mind.""Hoover, though, sought to keep his beliefs privateFormer presidents have kept mum even when they see a nominee as a threat to their legacy. In 1964, for example, former President Dwight D. Eisenhower didn't have much regard for Senator Barry Goldwater. The conservative firebrand had repudiated Eisenhower's presidency as a ""dime-store New Deal."" Nonetheless, Eisenhower gave only halting support to the party's anti-Goldwater forces. Despite Eisenhower's contempt, the Arizonan became the Republican nominee, only to lose in a landslide to President Lyndon B. Johnson.Four years earlier, the Democratic power brokers were not as reticent. They viewed Senator John F. Kennedy, their party's leading candidate in 1960, as too conservative and inexperienced. They disliked the campaign role of Joseph Kennedy, JFK's father, and his controversial past. In addition, party leaders worried that JFK could not win national office because he was a Catholic.During the primaries, Truman, the titular head of the party, told a TV news conference that a nominee should have ""the greatest possible maturity and experience"" -- a clear dig at JFK's relative youth. The former president beseeched his party to hold a brokered convention and find a way to avoid nominating Kennedy. Eventually, however, Truman endorsed Kennedy in the general election, reasoning that GOP nominee Richard M. Nixon was worse
Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic nominee in 1952 and 1956, also refused to back Kennedy during the primary. Even Kennedy's promise to name Stevenson as secretary of state could not persuade him.Still, most of the party elders' scathing criticism against JFK was confined to backroom conversations. Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson, who also wanted the nomination, privately mocked Kennedy as ""a scrawny little fellow with rickets."" Johnson urged Eisenhower to oppose Kennedy during the primary contest, calling him ""a [Senate] nobody"" and ""a dangerous man.""But Johnson's efforts to stop Kennedy were not aired before the country in real time. In fact, 1960 demonstrated how the Democratic elders were able to prevent serious rifts from destroying their party's chances. After securing the nomination, JFK offered -- and LBJ accepted -- the second slot on the ticket.The resentment of party elders toward party nominees was often rooted in a sense that the candidate was repudiating a mentor's record. In the 1960 GOP presidential race, for example, Eisenhower resented Vice President Nixon's implication that he would offer more robust leadership. Close to Election Day, Ike was asked to name an instance when Nixon's advice influenced a presidential decision. ""If you give me a week,"" Eisenhower replied, ""I might think of one.""
In the reverse situation, Vice President Al Gore sought to distance himself from President Bill Clinton during the 2000 presidential campaign. Gore declared in his announcement that he would provide ""moral leadership"" and defend the American family -- not-so-subtle knocks against Clinton's sexual relationship with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. The bitterness between the two men festered and Gore never asked Clinton to campaign with him. After Gore lost to George W. Bush, Clinton upbraided his former vice president for running a lame, visionless campaign.The current spectacle -- in which former Senator Bob Dole will likely be the only past Republican presidential nominee to come to the convention and endorse the party's standard bearer -- is partly a function of Trump's scorched-earth multi-media campaign. His attacks have been leveled personally, in real-time, via Twitter and cable news. Wounds are deeper, and could be harder to heal.Trump's presidential primary campaign is the apotheosis of the anti-Washington mood that has gripped presidential politics since Jimmy Carter's 1976 White House run. One reason Trump vanquished his foes was because he ran against the GOP's leadership as out-of-touch and inept.This played out even as party elders have less power to shape national tickets -- and outsiders more ability to tear down anything that smacks of Washington politics-as-usual.Republican-on-Republican hits on Trump and his main rival, Ted Cruz, have contributed to the fraying of the GOP. The anti-Trump former presidents, as well as current and former party chairmen and congressional leaders, have much at stake. They are fighting for, as they see it, their legacies, their party's future, their professional identities -- and their own power.In recent decades, party elders have been clinging to an increasingly tenuous position. Think former Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who lost a primary election, as Sarah Palin recently noted. Or former House Speaker John Boehner, who was unable to control his party's Tea Party wing. Boehner is still so incensed that he called Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) ""Lucifer in the flesh.""As we are seeing now with Ryan, Trump's ferocious public attacks could yet come back to haunt him. Unlike so many past presidential primaries, this rift might prove irreparable.

WASHINGTON Donald Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, will oversee the presumptive Republican U.S. presidential nominee's search for a running mate, a campaign aide said on Tuesday.Lewandowski last week took over the vice presidential selection process and is drawing up a list of potential candidates and speaking with Republican Party figures, two top Republicans told the Washington Post, which first reported the move.The two Republicans said they expected lawyers or a law firm to help vet Trump's short list of candidates, the Post reported.The Trump campaign aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that Lewandowski is leading the effort but would not elaborate.
Trump has said he is considering some of his former rivals for the Republican nomination. But some already have ruled themselves out or declared they will not support the billionaire businessman. One of those was U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who on Monday sought to quash speculation he might emerge as the running mate, saying he still has deep reservations about Trump.Trump has bristled at Republicans who publicly have taken themselves out of the running. The day after Rubio's announcement, Trump wrote in a Twitter post, ""It is only the people that were never asked to be VP that tell the press that they will not take the position.""
Trump has said he plans to select a Republican with political experience as his choice for vice president.Lewandowski has been part of Trump's inner circle since the beginning of his candidacy. Other Trump senior advisers, including Paul Manafort and Rick Wiley, will concentrate on the campaign's national field operation and planning for the Republican National Convention in July, the Post said.
Lewandowski has generated controversy during Trump's campaign for president. He was hit in March with a misdemeanor battery charge relating to an incident involving a female reporter, but prosecutors in Florida's Palm Beach County last month decided not to prosecute Lewandowski.

By Daniel Bases and Dan Burns
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives' Natural Resources Committee said on Monday legislation to address Puerto Rico's growing debt and humanitarian crisis will be introduced for discussion on Wednesday, with a committee vote a week later.Earlier attempts at introducing a bill out of the committee failed to gain enough attention or understanding among lawmakers, prompting its chairman, Rep. Rob Bishop, a Utah Republican, to delay and rework the bill.The basic premise of installing an independent oversight board to lead the restructuring of the U.S. commonwealth's credit and work with the local government to develop an economic reform plan remains in place.""What we are seeing in Puerto Rico is if you push it off, the situation gets worse, the debt gets worse, the humanitarian crisis gets worse. If you don't want a bailout and you put it off long enough, you probably will be forced into a position of being in a bailout and I'm not going to vote for that,"" Bishop said.Puerto Rico has already defaulted on some of its debt and faces an overall bill of $70 billion it cannot pay. A staggering 45 percent poverty rate and increased migration of citizens to the U.S. mainland drains economic activity.Bishop said the changes to the bill were relatively small and that the U.S. Treasury has been ""marvelous"" to work with in developing the plan.""Obviously the relationship between the Obama administration and this Congress has not been warm and fuzzy. So this is unusual in the amount of help they have given us,"" Bishop said, adding: ""At the same time I want it finished. I want them to actually sign off and in some of the small areas, I think they have been dragging their feet.""
U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew visited a Puerto Rican school and hospital on Monday where teachers, nurses and doctors described and showed dire conditions due to the lack of funding.Lew later told reporters he had not seen the latest language in the draft bill, but that the Treasury has provided technical advice. He said it was up to the committee to decide when to release the legislation.""I hope Congress does not, as it sometimes does, try to find that last possible moment and miss it,"" Lew said.Puerto Rico defaulted on May 1 for a third time on some of its debt, missing a roughly $400 million payment owed by the Government Development Bank, the island's main fiscal agent.
However, some of the GDB's major creditors are forgoing lawsuits for at least a month after reaching a tentative restructuring deal with the bank.""If we don't get a bill passed, then lawsuits are going to be coming fast and furiously,"" Bishop said.The May 1 default and the nearly $2 billion July 1 debt payments have spurred congressional activity.""The goal being that everyone eventually gets paid. And who is first in the line is maybe not as important as the fact that at the end of the day everyone has the chance to be treated fairly and will get their investment back,"" Bishop said.
Lew, in his remarks, added that the bill will have to take into account many stakeholders, not just bondholders.""The interests of retirees on the island have to be balanced, not treated necessarily equally, but balanced,"" Lew said, adding that television advertisements calling the legislation a bailout ""crossed the line and are deceptive.""Puerto Rico's government has said it has not asked for a taxpayer-led bailout, nor has one been offered.While the legislation will include bankruptcy language, it is not a stealthy way around a prohibition for Puerto Rico to use the U.S. bankruptcy code to restructure its debt, Bishop said.""We are putting this language in the code that deals specifically with the territories. So everything we do has got to have that firewall between that which will have an impact on the states versus what is there in the territory.""

By Doina Chiacu and Emily Stephenson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump backtracked on Monday on his remarks about raising taxes on wealthy Americans, saying the rich might simply get a smaller tax cut than he originally proposed.Trump walked away from his Sunday comment that taxes on the wealthy would ""go up"" once his broad tax policy proposals, which include tax cuts for rich Americans, were negotiated with Congress. That appeared to be a break with traditional Republican support for lower taxes in all income brackets.On Monday, Trump said he did not mean to imply he was willing to raise taxes for people in higher-income brackets from their current level, but was referring to potential adjustments to his own tax policy proposal.""I may have to increase it on the wealthy - I'm not going to allow it to be increased on the middle class,"" Trump said on CNN. ""Now, if I increase it on the wealthy, that means they're still going to be paying less than they are paying now. I'm talking about increasing it from my (original) tax proposal.""The proposal, released in September, included broad tax breaks for businesses and households, with the highest income tax rate cut to 25 percent from the current 39.6 percent.Trump, a billionaire real estate developer, said on Monday that lowering taxes on the middle class and businesses was his priority.""I'm not talking about a tax increase. I'm talking about a tremendous tax decrease, OK?"" Trump said on the Fox Business Network. He said proposals always changed in negotiations with Congress but that he was committed to cutting taxes.The contradictory statements came as Trump began pivoting to a general election race against likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump effectively clinched the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election last week after his last two rivals dropped out of the race.Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Bush administration official who also advised Republican John McCain during his failed 2008 presidential run, said Trump was trying to make his economic plans add up.
'IMPENETRABLE'
""He's gone from wildly unrealistic to impenetrable"" on the subject of taxes, Holtz-Eakin said, adding that Trump's comments about the outcome of possible negotiations with Congress ""makes me confused as to what he really wants.""Trump did win support from influential anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, who said on CNBC on Monday that some people with a lot of tax credits might see some increase, but that rates would drop overall under Trump's plan.
""He's made it very clear he wants lower taxes,"" Norquist said. ""Trump's tax cut would be a tax cut for every American.""Norquist's group, Americans for Tax Reform, asks all Republican candidates to sign a no-new-taxes pledge, but Trump has not signed one yet. Norquist said he was confident the candidate would sign, given his public comments.The Clinton campaign was happy to take Trump at his word that he planned to cut wealthy Americans' taxes. It cited an analysis of Trump's proposal by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimating it would give the wealthiest Americans an average annual boost of more than $1.3 million a year.""This is a tax plan by the billionaire for the billionaires,"" Clinton adviser Jake Sullivan said. ""And after some confusing comments over the weekend, he actually doubled down today on the fact that his tax plan would have massive cuts for the wealthy. Who knows what he'll say tomorrow?""Trump also sought on Monday to clarify comments he made last week about the U.S. debt. He said he never espoused restructuring or defaulting on government debt but would buy it back at a discount if interest rates go up.
""He should stop talking about the debt because he hasn't said anything that makes any sense yet,"" Holtz-Eakin said.Trump's candidacy has opened a rift in the Republican Party, with many leaders appalled by his rhetoric on immigrants, Muslims and women and concerned that some policy positions such as his opposition to free trade run counter to Republican orthodoxy.U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who said last week he was not yet ready to endorse Trump, said on Monday he would step down as co-chairman of the July 18-21 Republican National Convention if Trump wants him to. Trump on Sunday did not rule out pushing Ryan out from the speaker's traditional role as convention chairman.Ryan and Trump will meet on Thursday to try to iron out their differences. Later on Thursday, the candidate will meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other members of the Senate Republican leadership, a Senate Republican aide said on Monday.Trump said on Monday that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a former presidential rival who endorsed his candidacy shortly after dropping out of the race, would lead his White House transition team.Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, another vanquished presidential rival, sought on Monday to quash speculation he might emerge as the vice presidential running mate for Trump, saying he still had deep reservations about the former reality television star.

By Julia Harte and Colleen Jenkins
| WASHINGTON/WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.

WASHINGTON/WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. A fight between the Obama administration and North Carolina over a state law limiting public bathroom access for transgender people escalated on Monday as both sides sued each other, trading accusations of civil rights violations and government overreach.The U.S. Justice Department's complaint asked a federal district court in North Carolina to declare that the state is violating the 1964 Civil Rights Act and order it to stop enforcing the ban.Hours earlier, North Carolina's Republican governor, Pat McCrory, and the state's secretary of public safety sued the agency in a different federal court in North Carolina, accusing it of ""baseless and blatant overreach.""The so-called bathroom law, passed in March and known as HB 2, prohibits people from using public restrooms not corresponding to their biological sex.It has thrust North Carolina into the center of a national debate over equality and privacy, and has now led the state into what could be a long and costly legal battle with the U.S. government.Americans are divided over how public restrooms should be used by transgender people, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, with 44 percent saying people should use them according to their biological sex and 39 percent saying they should be used according to the gender with which they identify.      By passing the law, North Carolina became the first state in the country to ban people from using multiple occupancy restrooms or changing rooms in public buildings and schools that do not match the sex on their birth certificate.U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on Monday the department ""retains the option"" of curtailing federal funding to North Carolina unless it backs down.
""None of us can stand by when a state enters the business of legislating identity and insists that a person pretend to be something or someone that they are not,"" Lynch said at a news conference, comparing the measure to Jim Crow-era racial discrimination laws and bans on same-sex marriage.Lynch said the department is monitoring other U.S. jurisdictions that have passed or considered laws similar to North Carolina's but declined to say whether the agency was planning any action against them.     White House spokesman Josh Earnest called the North Carolina law ""mean-spirited"" but McCrory said in his complaint that it is ""common sense privacy policy.""North Carolina Republicans say the law stops men from posing as transgender to gain access to women's restrooms.    
BILLIONS AT STAKE
North Carolina stands to lose $4.8 billion in funds, mainly educational grants, if it does not back down, according to an analysis by lawyers at the University of California, Los Angeles Law School.The Justice Department's complaint named the state of North Carolina, McCrory, the state's Department of Public Safety and the University of North Carolina system as defendants.
The 17-campus University of North Carolina system says it takes federal non-discrimination laws very seriously but must also adhere to state laws like HB 2.    ""In these circumstances, the University is truly caught in the middle,"" UNC President Margaret Spellings said.McCrory told reporters that North Carolina had been forced to pass the law after the Charlotte city council passed an ordinance that allowed transgender people access to bathrooms based on gender identity in public and private buildings.  ""We're taking the Obama admin to court. They're bypassing Congress, attempting to rewrite law & policies for the whole country, not just NC,"" McCrory wrote on Twitter.  The Republican leaders of North Carolina's state legislature also sued the U.S. government over the law on Monday, hours after McCrory's lawsuit.The law is also being challenged in federal district court by critics including the American Civil Liberties Union.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. A bill requiring all single-occupancy public restrooms to be open to anyone regardless of gender or gender identity passed the California Assembly on Monday, and will proceed to the state Senate.The most populous U.S. state already bars discrimination against transgender people, including in public restrooms. The measure by state Assemblyman Phil Ting, a Democrat from San Francisco, goes farther, saying that single-use restrooms should not be reserved for one sex.""Restrooms are a necessity of life, making equal access to them a civil rights issue,"" Ting said in a press statement.The measure passed on a 55-19 vote. A date has not been set for the Senate to consider the bill.
Supporters have said that in addition to protecting transgender or gender fluid people, the bill would also cut down waiting time at single-occupancy public restrooms by allowing anyone to use facilities previously reserved for men or women.The bill came during a nationwide furor over a law passed by the state of North Carolina requiring people to use restrooms consistent with their biological sex.
On Monday, a fight between the Obama administration and North Carolina over that law escalated as both sides sued each other, trading accusations of civil rights violations and government overreach.
