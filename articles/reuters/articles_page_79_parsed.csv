By Leah Schnurr
| OTTAWA

OTTAWA Canada, fearful of talk by the U.S. presidential candidates to  reopen the North American Free Trade Agreement, could use the opportunity to push for a better deal on worker mobility, dispute resolutions and other issues, Canadian negotiators of the original pact said.Republican Donald Trump calls NAFTA the worst trade deal signed by the United States and Democrat Hillary Clinton has signaled a change of position on the 1994 pact she supported when it became law under her husband, former president Bill Clinton.The agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico is often used for political grist in U.S. election campaigns but altering it is a major concern for export-oriented Canada.In 2008, Barack Obama campaigned on renegotiating the treaty with tougher labor and environmental standards, a pledge that fell to the wayside when he became president in January 2009.But the idea has taken hold more strongly in 2016 and Mexico has said it is ready to update the treaty. Canada has said NAFTA is in the best interest of all three countries.If Canada were forced to renegotiate, one issue it could target is the pact's investor-state dispute settlement provision.
The United States wanted it included in the original deal to protect U.S. investments in Mexico. It has since been used by American companies to sue Canadian federal and provincial governments. TransCanada Corp is using the provision to seek billions from the U.S. government for rejecting the Keystone XL pipeline.That would probably be an area of mutual concern for Canada and the United States given those unintended consequences, said Derek Burney, Canada's former U.S. ambassador, who was involved in the original negotiations.Labor mobility, a concern for Canadian technology companies, could be improved by updating the list of professions that allows workers to relocate between countries.""We fell short in terms of what we wanted to achieve on labor mobility in the NAFTA,"" said John Weekes, Canada's chief negotiator, who added Canada should also push for improved access to the U.S. government procurement market.
Reopening NAFTA could give the Canadian government cover to phase out a domestic supply management system for the politically powerful dairy industry that has come under international criticism, negotiators said.""I'd be secretly delighted if they came hard at us on supply management,"" said Burney. ""Given the dairy industry and its weight in the United States, it's not easy to dismiss.""The system controls dairy prices and production, which critics say drives up consumers prices. The industry says it allows farmers to get stable prices, and noted Canada has preserved the system while negotiating several trade agreements.
Still, former negotiators warned Canada would not be working from a position of strength as it sought concessions.""Ignoring everything else, yes, there could be an opportunity there,"" said Michael Hart, who advised on the original negotiations. ""But in the real world, I'd be very cautious.""While Clinton has said she would rework the trade pact, Trump's threat to withdraw is a bigger concern in Canada.""If we're in a situation where people are threatening they're going to walk out of trade agreements unless they can be renegotiated, then I think we're in a situation where it would be very difficult,"" said Weekes.

By Joseph Ax

Oklahoma's highest court on Tuesday struck down a law imposing restrictions on abortion providers, including a requirement that they take samples of fetal tissue from patients younger than 14 and preserve them for state investigators.The law also set new criminal penalties for providers who violate abortion-related statutes as well as individuals who help a minor evade the requirement to obtain parental consent. In addition, the bill created a new, stricter inspection system for abortion clinics.Legislators had said the fetal tissue section was aimed at capturing child rapists and that the law would protect women's health. But the New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights, which challenged the law in court, said it unfairly targeted facilities that perform abortions.In a unanimous opinion, the nine-member Oklahoma Supreme Court found the law violated the state constitution's requirement that each legislative bill must address only ""one subject."" The rule, the court said, is designed to prevent legislators from including provisions that would not normally pass in otherwise popular bills. The state unsuccessfully asserted that each part of the law addressed a single subject: women's reproductive health.
""We reject defendants' arguments and find this legislation violates the single subject rule as each of these sections is so unrelated and misleading that a legislator voting on this matter could have been left with an unpalatable all-or-nothing choice,"" Justice Joseph Watt wrote for the court.In a concurring opinion, four judges said they also would have struck down the law as an unconstitutional burden on a woman's right to have an abortion.Lincoln Ferguson, a spokesman for the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office, called the decision ""disappointing.""
""This law would have given law enforcement the ability to more easily prosecute sexual assaults of children that are discovered when a child under 14 has an abortion,"" he said. ""The Attorney General's Office remains committed to defending laws aimed at protecting the safety and well-being of Oklahoma women.""
In a statement, Center for Reproductive Rights President Nancy Northup said the law was ""nothing but a cynical attack on women's health and rights by unjustly targeting their trusted health care providers.""Oklahoma's Republican-dominated government has joined several socially conservative states in enacting abortion restrictions in recent years, drawing court challenges.In June, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Texas law imposing strict regulations on facilities that perform abortions. A similar law is on hold in Oklahoma while the state Supreme Court considers its legality. (Reporting by Joseph Ax; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Alan Crosby)"	[]	['abortion']

By Anthony Boadle and Maria Carolina Marcello
| BRASILIA

BRASILIA Brazilian President Michel Temer's government introduced to Congress on Tuesday a landmark constitutional amendment to cap public spending, seeking to press ahead with unpopular reforms in the wake of last weekend's municipal elections.Temer's new center-right government hopes the proposal, which would limit growth in spending to the rate of inflation for up to 20 years, will clear a Congressional committee this week and be put to a vote in the lower house by next week.The amendment is designed to curb a budget deficit equivalent to 10 percent of gross domestic product last year. Hopes for its passage have made Brazilian assets among the best performing in the world this year despite an economy submerged in a two-year recession.In a concession to ease its passage, the government announced on Monday that a cap on health and education expenditure would not go into effect until 2018, rather than next year.Leftist opponents have demanded more time to debate a measure they say violates the spirit of Brazil's 1988 constitution, which made generous provisions for social spending. They plan to seek a court injunction to block the amendment.Backers warn that Latin America's largest nation, which is wrestling with a sprawling corruption scandal, could follow Greece's path to financial meltdown if spending is not controlled. Temer said on Monday that public debt, which ended last year at a level equivalent to two-thirds of economic output, would reach 100 percent of GDP by 2024 without the measure.
""If this change is not adopted, fiscal collapse and the  insolvency of public accounts are inevitable,"" lawmaker Darcisio Perondi said in his report to the committee studying the measure. ""Brazil could repeat the tragedy of Greece."" Perondi said the previous government of Dilma Rousseff, who was removed from office in August for breaking budget laws, left an onerous legacy of overdrawn accounts, and he called on the lawmakers who impeached her to back the cap.The conclusion of municipal elections in most cities across Brazil last weekend allows Temer's ruling Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) and its coalition allies a freer hand to back the measure. A small number of cities face a second-round runoff this month.
But resistance from Rousseff's Workers Party and its allies, as well as division within Temer's own coalition, point to a difficult path for a proposal that requires two approvals in each chamber of Congress by a three-fifths majority.""We will seek an injunction because this violates the Constitution and the right of five future governments to decide their economic policies,"" said opposition leader Jandira Feghali of the Communist Party of Brazil.Temer, 75, who was sworn in to serve the remainder of Rousseff's term through 2018, had vowed to put Brazil back on its tracks and investors like his promises of fiscal discipline. 
But a poll published on Tuesday showed Temer has failed to convince Brazilians that his government is any better than Rousseff's. The survey by pollster Ibope showed that Temer's approval ratings remain low and some 68 percent of Brazilians do not trust him. The lower House is also expected to vote on Tuesday on a bill that changes the rules for the exploration of Brazil's vast offshore oil reserves in the costly subsalt layer, aimed at boosting private investment in the oil industry. The proposal removes the obligation for scandal-plagued, debt-ridden state oil company Petrobras to be the only operator of these oil fields and have a minimum 30 percent stake in their development.

By Francois Murphy
| VIENNA

VIENNA Amid charges from Donald Trump that the U.S. presidential election could be ""rigged"" and concerns of rights activists that black voters may face undue obstacles, the head of an international observer team pledged a full review ranging from voting machines to racial bias as it began work on Tuesday.The team from the 57-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) that will monitor the Nov. 8 presidential and Congressional elections is set to be the biggest the organization has sent to the United States, tasked with checking the vote meets international standards.Republican candidate Trump's apparent suggestion that the vote might not be free and fair has drawn an angry response from his opponents, who say it is baseless.Democrat Hillary Clinton has led Trump in national opinion polls in recent months. On Tuesday, an average of polls aggregated by RealClearPolitics website showed her with 48.1 percent of support compared to Trump's 44.3 percent. Civil rights advocates have also said voters are more likely to face racial bias at this election than they have in 50 years, because of voting laws that several states passed after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down part of the landmark anti-discrimination 1965 Voting Rights Act three years ago.""We do have concerns about voter registration, voter identification and also electronic voting,"" the head of the OSCE mission, British lawyer and diplomat Audrey Glover said in a telephone interview, adding that the mission is impartial.
""We always let the facts speak for themselves, so let's see what happens,"" she said. Allegations such as Trump's, however,  were for the U.S. authorities to follow up on while the OSCE observed, she added. ""We're not policemen.""The Shelby County v Holder Supreme Court ruling in 2013 struck down a part of the Voting Rights Act that was used to determine which areas with a history of discrimination had to obtain special permission before changing their voting laws.That has raised concerns among rights groups that laws on issues like voter identification have since been changed to make it more difficult for poor and minority voters to take part.
The OSCE, which comprises much of Europe, Central Asia and North America, has also suggested that all electronic voting machines be required by law to leave a verifiable paper trail, though many states do not provide one.Glover said her team would seek to clarify where it legally can and cannot go, adding that states' and counties' stance on international observers was often not clear. Texas also threatened OSCE observers with prosecution four years ago, which the organization called ""unacceptable"" at the time.Glover, however, struck a conciliatory tone.
""If the law says international observers are not allowed, then obviously we won't try and go. We're not going to try and make any sort of a scene,"" she told Reuters. But the biggest hindrance might be self-inflicted. The OSCE had hoped to deploy 100 so-called long-term observers in the coming week, but OSCE states - including Germany, France, Spain, Romania, Finland, Bosnia - have only provided 26. Up to 400 short-term observers will begin work close to Election Day.""We'll do what we can with what we've got,"" Glover said. ""We will try and make a silk purse out of a pig's ear and we will try and cover the whole of the United States, or to the extent that is feasible.""

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared ready to rule against a Puerto Rican politician who maintained he cannot be retried on corruption charges involving a trip to Las Vegas to watch a boxing bout after his original conviction was thrown out.The eight justices heard the first oral argument of their new term in the appeal filed by Hector Martinez Maldonado, who served in Puerto Rico's Senate from 2005 until his 2011 conviction, and businessman Juan Bravo Fernandez, former president of a private security company.Several justices expressed skepticism about the defendants' arguments.Bravo Fernandez sought to bribe Martinez Maldonado to win passage of bills that would benefit his business, according to prosecutors. The case focused in part on allegations that Bravo Fernandez paid for Martinez Maldonado to travel to Las Vegas in 2005 to watch boxer Felix ""Tito"" Trinidad, a sports hero in the Caribbean U.S. territory, lose to underdog Winky Wright.Bravo Fernandez and Martinez Maldonado were convicted for their roles in the alleged bribery scheme. The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out their convictions in 2013.
Federal prosecutors planned a new trial but the two men said it should be barred because it would violate the U.S. Constitution's protection against ""double jeopardy,"" preventing people from being tried on charges for which they already have been acquitted.Their lawyers said double jeopardy applies because the jury had acquitted them on some of the criminal charges concerning conduct closely related to the actions on which the retrial would be focused. Prosecutors said the acquittals were inconsistent with the convictions, suggesting jurors did not understand the law.Based on the questions they asked, the justices appeared unlikely to throw out a 2015 appeals court decision backing prosecutors.
Justice Elena Kagan asked the defendants' attorney, Lisa Blatt, about her argument: ""Is it anything more than rhetoric?""Chief Justice John Roberts told Blatt it was her burden to show the jury's verdict was a legal and valid judgment on the same set of facts that the government wants to re-try, and not just a misunderstanding.
A ruling is due by the end of June.Outside the courthouse, protesters demanded that the U.S. Senate confirm Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama's nominee to fill the court's vacancy left by the February death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Senate Republicans have refused to act on Garland's nomination, saying Obama's successor should make the appointment after taking office in January.

By James Oliphant and Emily Stephenson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON New York's attorney general ordered Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's charitable foundation to immediately stop fundraising in the state, warning that a failure to do so would be a ""continuing fraud.""For Trump, the cease-and-desist order was the latest in a series of blows that has sent his campaign reeling. The New York businessman and his aides spent much of the weekend dealing with the fallout from a New York Times report that said Trump may have avoided paying federal income taxes for almost 20 years.New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office said the Donald J. Trump Foundation was violating a state law requiring charitable organizations that solicit outside donations to register with the office's Charities Bureau.The order followed a series of reports in The Washington Post that suggested improprieties by the foundation, including using its funds to settle legal disputes involving Trump businesses.""The failure immediately to discontinue solicitation and to file information and reports required under Article 7-A with the Charities Bureau shall be deemed to be a continuing fraud upon the people of the state of New York,"" according to a letter dated on Friday that the office posted online on Monday.Trump's campaign has suggested that the probe launched by Schneiderman, a Democrat, was politically motivated.While again putting Trump's campaign on the defensive, the order could also undercut his efforts to make the Clinton Foundation, the family charity of Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton, a primary target in his campaign against her for the Nov. 8 election.Trump has sought to paint the Clinton Foundation as a ""pay-to-play"" operation under which the former U.S. secretary of state and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, rewarded big donors to the foundation with access.
The Clinton Foundation, which has $354 million in assets and almost 500 staffers, is a radically different charitable vehicle from the small-scale Trump nonprofit. It has worked to reduce the cost of drugs for people with HIV in developing countries, eradicate childhood obesity in the United States and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.There has been no evidence that foreign donors to the foundation obtained favors from the State Department while Clinton headed the agency. While some donors were able to obtain meetings with her or senior State Department officials, Clinton has said the fact that they had donated to the foundation did not play a role in her decision to meet with them.'POLITICAL MOTIVES'
The scrutiny of the Trump Foundation came as the Republican candidate was dealing with a torrent of bad news, including his shaky performance in his first debate with Clinton on Sept. 26 and the release by the New York Times of tax records that showed Trump taking an almost $1 billion loss in 1995 that may have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years.
In its series on the Trump Foundation, The Washington Post reported that Trump may have violated U.S. Internal Revenue Service rules against ""self-dealing"" by using foundation money to purchase two portraits of himself, which were then hung at his private golf clubs in New York and Florida.The newspaper also said that Trump may have improperly used the foundation to settle legal disputes, including one at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, diverted income from his business to the charity to avoid paying income tax, and donated foundation money to support Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a Republican, who was considering launching an investigation into Trump University, Trump's for-profit education venture.The foundation ended up paying a $2,500 fine to the IRS for that donation. A Trump Organization representative told the Post the donation was meant to be from Trump's personal account, and that it came from his foundation's account by clerical error.In response to the Post's reporting, Schneiderman's office began a probe into the Trump Foundation.
The Trump campaign said in a statement on Monday that the charity would cooperate with the investigation.""While we remain very concerned about the political motives behind AG Schneiderman's investigation, the Trump Foundation nevertheless intends to cooperate fully with the investigation,"" said Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks.""Because this is an ongoing legal matter, the Trump Foundation will not comment further at this time,"" she added.The New York Attorney General's Office is the sole regulator of charities in the state. A spokesman for the office said it was not unusual for the regulator to send notices to charities whose filings were overdue or incomplete but that a cease-and-desist letter was more serious.While letters such as the one the Trump Foundation, which is based in Woodbury, New York, on Long Island, received are not judgments of wrongdoing, they are sent only after the office gets ""a clear indication of wrongdoing,"" the spokesman said.Trump established the charitable foundation in 1988, but it runs no programs of its own. Instead, it donates money to other nonprofit groups such as the Police Athletic League for youths. Once the foundation began soliciting money from other donors beyond the Trump family, it was required by New York law to register with the state and file regular reports.

By Amy Tennery
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign defended comments he made on combat veterans and mental health on Monday, after some said his remarks implied service members diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were weak.At an event with veterans in Herndon, Virginia, Trump called for better mental health services for those returning from combat, saying that while many are ""strong,"" others ""can't handle"" what they have seen on the battlefield.The response struck some as insulting to veterans struggling with PTSD, as the Republican candidate works to motivate traditionally conservative military voters to support him in the Nov. 8 presidential election.Retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, a Trump adviser on military issues, said in a written statement that the candidate's comments were taken out of context ""in order to deceive voters and veterans.""Marine Staff Sergeant Chad Robichaux, whose question at the event prompted Trump's statement, said the critical reaction was ""sickening"" and accused others of manipulating Trump's words.
""I took his comments to be thoughtful and understanding of the struggles many veterans have,"" said Robichaux, an Afghanistan combat veteran who has been diagnosed with PTSD.Trump made his remarks at an event hosted by a political action committee called Retired American Warriors. Trump has cast himself a champion of veterans during his campaign and in July pledged to reform federal programs for war veterans.He attended a military preparatory school but did not serve in the U.S. military. 
Joe Donnelly, a Democratic U.S. senator from Indiana, was one of the first to criticize Trump's remarks.""We need to dismiss the idea that mental health issues signify weakness, and reinforce that there is strength in seeking help,"" Donnelly said in a written statement.PTSD was among the most talked about topics on Twitter on Monday, as many social media users responded to Trump's comments.
""@realDonaldTrump As a Veteran with PTSD, I'm stronger than you could ever be,"" tweeted Kevin Plantz (@KevinPlantz).""My husband served this country honorably,"" tweeted Melissa Bird (@birdgirl1001). ""He has #PTSD. #Trump has officially crossed the line for me and my family.""Neither the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs nor the campaign for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, immediately returned requests for comment.

By Timothy Mclaughlin
| CHICAGO

CHICAGO Indiana Governor Mike Pence, the Republican nominee for U.S. vice president, lost another round in federal court on Monday in his bid to keep refugees fleeing Syria's civil war from resettling in his state.The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago affirmed a lower-court ruling that Pence's order seeking to bar state agencies from helping the resettlement of Syrian immigrants discriminates against the refugees based on their national origin.The setback for Pence comes a day before he is scheduled to debate the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Virginia Governor Tim Kaine, on national television.Pence was among more than 25 U.S. governors, mostly Republicans, who urged President Barack Obama to stop resettling refugees fleeing Syria's civil war after November attacks by extremists in Paris that killed 130.
Critics of the resettlement program have argued that it leaves the United States vulnerable to infiltration by militants from Islamic State, also known as ISIS, which has seized vast swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq and claimed responsibility for attacks on civilians in Paris and elsewhere.But Appeals Court Judge Richard Posner, writing for the three-judge panel that sided unanimously against Pence, said the governor's assertions of a national security threat were presented ""without evidence"" and amounted to ""nightmare speculation.""All three appellate panel members are Republican appointees, including Judge Diane Sykes, who Pence's running mate, Donald Trump, has said he would nominate to the U.S. Supreme Court if he wins the Nov. 8 presidential election.
A Pence spokeswoman, Kara Brooks, said the FBI and U.S. Homeland Security Department have acknowledged ""security gaps"" in screening of Syrian refugees. She also quoted a State Department spokesman who said last month that he ""'wouldn't debate the fact that there's the potential for ISIS terrorists to try to insert themselves' into the refugee program."" Pence's order was blocked by a U.S. district judge in February after a court challenge brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and he appealed. 
The ACLU welcomed the court's ruling on Monday as upholding the group's position that the governor ""may not constitutionally or legally discriminate against a particular nationality of refugees that are extensively vetted by the federal government.""Indiana has accepted 150 Syrian immigrants between Oct. 1, 2015, and Aug. 31, 2016, accounting for about 9 percent of all refugee arrivals in the state during that period, according to the State Department.

By Lawrence Hurley
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to rehear a bid to revive President Barack Obama's plan to spare from deportation millions of immigrants in the country illegally, a case in which the justices split 4-4 in June.In a brief order, the court rejected the Obama administration's long-shot request, meaning the justices' June 23 decision is final. That ruling left in place lower court decisions blocking the plan, which Obama announced in 2014 but never went into effect.The high court remains one justice short following Antonin Scalia's February death.The Democratic president's plan was challenged in court by Republican-governed Texas and 25 other states that argued he overstepped the powers granted to him by the U.S. Constitution by infringing upon congressional authority. Obama acted unilaterally by executive action, bypassing the Republican-led Congress.""This is the latest setback to the president's attempt to expand executive power and another victory for those who believe in the Constitution's separation of powers and the rule of law,"" Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said of the Supreme Court's action on Monday.
Obama's plan was designed to let roughly 4 million people - those who have lived illegally in the United States at least since 2010, have no criminal record and have children who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents - get into a program that shields them from deportation and supplies work permits.The administration in July asked the court to take a second look at the case once it had a full complement of nine justices.
""The inability of the Supreme Court in this situation to reach a decision and put forward a ruling has a negative impact on millions of people in the United States,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters, calling on Senate Republicans to confirm a ninth justice.The administration's immigration enforcement efforts, focusing on criminals, recent border-crossers and on people who pose a national security threat, will move forward, unaffected by the Supreme Court's action, Earnest said.The Republican-led Senate, in a move with little precedent in U.S. history, has refused to consider Obama's nominee to replace Scalia, federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland, saying Obama's successor should make the appointment.
""By continuing their historic, unprecedented obstruction of Chief Judge Merrick Garland's nomination, Republicans are spreading gridlock and denying justice to the American people,"" Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said.An estimated 11 million immigrants live in the United States illegally.

NEW YORK The U.S. presidential race tightened in a number of traditional battleground states, though Democrat Hillary Clinton remained the favorite to win the White House, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project poll released on Monday.The project, which uses a national online opinion poll of more than 15,000 people, showed that, as of Thursday, Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump were running nearly even in support in Florida and Ohio: states where she had held an advantage. Arizona, where Trump had held an advantage, was also considered a toss-up.Meanwhile, Maine, Oregon and Pennsylvania were considered states that Clinton would likely win. They had previously been considered toss-ups.
Overall, the project showed that Clinton continued to hold the advantage over Trump in the Electoral College, the body that ultimately picks the president. 
If the U.S. presidential election were held today, Clinton would lead Trump 246 to 180 in the Electoral College, and had an 88 percent chance of gaining the 270 electoral votes needed to become the U.S. chief executive.A separate Reuters/Ipsos online poll showed that a majority of Americans felt that Clinton won last week's presidential debate. Over the past several weeks, the Democrat had maintained a lead of 4 to 5 percentage points in support over Trump among likely voters.
