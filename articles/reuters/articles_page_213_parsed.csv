By Emily Flitter
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Donald Trump's attacks on a federal judge of Mexican heritage have ignited hundreds of postings on social media about an advocacy group for Latinos that some Trump supporters are calling a terrorist organization.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee has said that U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, an Indiana native whose parents are Mexican immigrants, is making unfair rulings against him as the presiding judge in a class-action lawsuit over Trump University because of his plans to crack down on illegal immigration, including a promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.As evidence of what they say is Curiel's bias, Trump and some of his supporters have pointed to the judge's membership in La Raza Lawyers of San Diego, a local group for Hispanic lawyers that is affiliated with the Hispanic National Bar Association.Some Trump supporters have incorrectly linked La Raza Lawyers to the National Council of La Raza, a 50-year-old civil rights group that has been strongly critical of Trump's proposals on immigration, as well as his idea to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. The NCLR's non-profit designation bars it from engaging in political campaigns, and the group's website describes it as a ""nonpartisan voice for Latinos."" A conservative blog, GotNews.com, first noted Curiel's membership in the lawyer's group, which it identified simply as ""La Raza,"" on May 31. A day later, another conservative website, The Daily Caller, made a link to the NCLR.After the NCLR was first named, Trump fans on Twitter began attacking it. ""Judge #TrumpHater #GonzaloCuriel is a member of the #TERRORIST group #LaRazza #BANLaRazza #GonzaloCuriel #RESIGN,"" wrote a user @WillysBaldSpot, whose profile describes her as a Trump supporter. ""I would never have known the ""La Raza"" organization existed without Trump's controversial comments. #genius,"" wrote @asamjulian, another self-proclaimed Trump fan.
TRUMP: ""HE'S GOT BIAS""
Trump on Sunday repeated his attack on Curiel in an interview on CBS's ""Face the Nation.""""He's a member of a club or society very strongly pro-Mexican, which is all fine. But I say he's got bias,"" Trump said in the interview. ""This judge has treated me very unfairly. He's treated me in a hostile manner, and there's something going on,"" he added.
The words ""La Raza"" translate from Spanish to mean ""the race,"" which Trump fans cite as proof the NCLR is a group of people who hate anyone who isn't Hispanic. Lisa Navarrete, an NCLR spokeswoman, rejected that interpretation, saying that ""thousands"" of groups had names that included ""La Raza"" as a ""nod to our common heritage.""The attacks on the advocacy group are the latest signs of the increasing racial tension in the 2016 presidential race. Critics have said Trump's calls to deport undocumented immigrants and ban Muslims amount to racism. His supporters say he's defending the country from terrorism and violence. Some supporters of the New York businessman have blamed the NCLR for the violent clashes between anti-Trump protesters and Trump fans at a San Jose, California, rally last week.
""Thank you La Raza for putting California into play for Trump,"" wrote another supporter, @magnifier661. ""Your violent fascism turned off the voting class #MAGA (a hashtag meaning Make America Great Again)."" The NCLR has been criticized in the past for its leaders' statements on immigration - the group supports a path to citizenship for people who entered the United States illegally - but Navarrete said it has never before attracted the ire of a presidential candidate. Over the past week, she said, she and other NCLR officials have been calling journalists and pundits they believe are mischaracterizing the group. ""We've been doing a lot of correcting the media and making sure they're not repeating what supporters of Mr. Trump are saying,"" she said.""We're sitting around arguing the minutiae of banking regulation, not running around in hoods.'""Hope Hicks, Trump's spokeswoman, declined to comment.

By James Oliphant and Dan Whitcomb
| WASHINGTON/LONG BEACH, California

WASHINGTON/LONG BEACH, California If Hillary Clinton ends up losing California to Bernie Sanders, it will be because of voters like Nallely Perez.Perez personifies what a Clinton supporter was supposed to look like: a 24-year-old Latina who grew up idolizing the former first lady as a groundbreaking woman in politics. But when she votes in California's Democratic presidential nominating contest on Tuesday, Perez will be supporting Sanders.  ""Everything that I would stand for, he has said it,"" said Perez, a student at California State University, Long Beach, who said she likes Sanders' promises of tuition-free college and universal healthcare. ""We found our voice in him."" California is the final big contest in the long, bitter fight for the Democratic nomination. Opinion polls show the Democratic race there tightening in recent weeks. Where Clinton, a former secretary of state, once held a big lead over Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, the two now are nearly tied. A University of Southern California/Los Angeles Times poll released on Friday showed Sanders with a one-percentage-point lead over Clinton in the state, 44 to 43 percent, a swing from March when Clinton held a nine-point edge. On the Republican side, Donald Trump has earned the nomination for the Nov. 8 election, and Clinton is close to capturing the number of delegates she needs to head the Democratic ticket. Her campaign expects that a win in New Jersey earlier on Tuesday will secure the nomination. But a loss in a populous Democratic stronghold like California could lend credence to Trump's claim that she is a weakened candidate. ""Clinton would like to go to the nominating convention with the wind at her back and tamp down the perception that she doesn't excite Democrats,"" said Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist in Washington.A Sanders victory will not clear the way to his nomination unless it triggers a defection by scores of superdelegates - party office-holders and officials - from Clinton's camp, an unlikely outcome. 
Sanders has vowed to use California as a springboard to the party convention in Philadelphia in July. A win, especially a big one, would validate the self-described democratic socialist's decision to stay in the race to the end and give him leverage to influence Clinton's policies and cabinet picks.""The game he is playing is to be able to draw as many concessions as he can out of the party and the Clinton campaign,"" Mollineau said.A SANDERS SURGE?

The area around Long Beach, part of the 47th congressional district in California, has emerged as a key battleground. Sanders campaigned there a week ago; Clinton was in the area on Friday and may return again before Tuesday's vote.The district's congressman, Representative Alan Lowenthal, remains one of the few uncommitted Democratic members of the House of Representatives to either Clinton or Sanders. His district once leaned Republican, but is becoming increasingly liberal thanks to an influx of Latino and Asian-American voters who comprise the majority of  residents. The large minority population might be expected to translate into an advantage for Clinton, who has consistently shown strength with such groups. But a Reuters reporter who toured the area observed an abundance of Sanders supporters. In the Belmont Shore neighborhood of Long Beach, Sanders  volunteers Gordon Winiemko and Jon Fellman manned a table on the sidewalk outside a coffeehouse. They had a long discussion with Shawn Coleman, a 24-year-old film student, who told them he preferred Sanders to Clinton because ""I think I'm a little bit more for what Bernie has in mind for the future, I think he's right, and Hillary doesn't really seem on it."" 
Lia Roldan, a 42-year-old set decorator in the film industry who lives in Long Beach, said she was voting for Sanders because ""he has a lot of experience in standing up for causes that benefit the working class.""Roldan said she would reluctantly support Clinton in a contest against Trump.""I'll vote for her only because I don't want a Republican to win, but I don't really feel in my heart that I would vote for her otherwise,"" she said. Stopping Trump was on the minds of those who said they would vote for Clinton on Tuesday. ""I love Bernie,"" said Sami Reed, 42, the CEO of a corporate wellness business, interviewed in a thrift shop, ""but I'll probably vote for Hillary just because I don't want Trump to win."" A second-term congressman, Lowenthal told Reuters he has come under a ""tremendous amount of grief and pressure from Sanders people"" to support him, but he would not say for whom he would vote.At California events, Clinton has been careful to focus her criticism on Trump, not Sanders, while talking up her national security experience. She will almost certainly need the support of passionate Sanders' backers to defeat the outspoken Trump in November.

NEW YORK New York Mayor Bill de Blasio on Monday announced a citywide advertising campaign supporting a person's right to use bathrooms corresponding with his or her gender identity, wading into a debate that has pitted more than a dozen states against the federal government.The advertisements, which de Blasio described as the nation's first government-sponsored citywide campaign of its kind, will appear in subway cars, at bus stops, on phone booths and in both online and traditional publications.The ads feature transgender New Yorkers and encourage residents to ""look past pink and blue,"" among other messages.In March, de Blasio signed an executive order ensuring that transgender people can use the bathroom of their choice in any city-owned building without being asked for identification by employees. City law already allows transgender individuals to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity.
""While other cities and states are legislating intolerance and taking away individuals' right to use bathrooms consistent with their gender identity, we are proudly standing with our transgender and gender non-conforming New Yorkers,"" de Blasio, a Democrat, said in a statement.President Barack Obama's administration in May released guidance telling public schools across the United States that they must allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice. The letter, which offered the U.S. government's interpretation of anti-discrimination law, contained the implicit threat of cutting off federal funding for schools that do not comply. 
Officials from more than a dozen states have either sued or plan to sue the Obama administration, challenging the directive as unconstitutional.
North Carolina and the U.S. Department of Justice exchanged federal lawsuits last month over the state's law banning people from using bathrooms that do not correspond to their gender of their birth. (Reporting by Joseph Ax; Editing by Frank McGurty and Lisa Von Ahn)"	['Obama']	[]

By Luciana Lopez
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK As she looks ahead to the November White House election, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has hired the leader of a group that seeks to built political power among Latinos to help mobilize key voting communities.Cristobal Alex, president of the non-partisan Latino Victory Project, will be the Clinton campaign's new deputy director of voter outreach and mobilization, starting later this month, an aide said. Alex will work under Addisu Demissie, the national voter outreach and mobilization director. Minority voters have been major blocs for Clinton as she has built a commanding lead over Senator Bernie Sanders, her rival for the Democratic nomination, and they could prove a crucial factor in the general election. Among those minority voters are Latinos, a fast-growing group that, many activists say, has recently seen a spike in voter registration. Many activists point to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump as the spur for those registrations.
Seeking to portray himself as tough on illegal immigration, Trump has angered Latinos by saying Mexico is sending rapists and drug dealers over the border, and pledging to build a border wall that he says he will make Mexico pay for. Most recently, he has drawn criticism, including from senior Republicans, for saying a Mexican-American federal judge overseeing lawsuits involving fraud allegations against Trump University cannot do his job properly because of his Mexican heritage.In contrast, both Clinton and Sanders have actively wooed Latino voters, releasing ads in Spanish and promising to hire Latinos to key cabinet positions. But one complication when courting these voters is the difficulty in polling multi-lingual, multi-cultural communities.
""Throughout the election cycle we know that we are going to see a lot of really bad Latino polling,"" said Matt Barreto, co-founder of research firm Latino Decisions and pollster for the Clinton campaign for Latino issues.Barreto said that he has used ""large sample surveys of Latino voters"" for the campaign. ""We are very confident that the Clinton campaign is taking all the necessary steps to gather the most accurate data possible on Latinos voters,"" he added.
Clinton added to her delegate lead Sunday, when she won Puerto Rico's primary. Primaries on Tuesday, when Clinton hopes to wrap up the nomination, include delegate-rich California, with a diverse population including Latinos, African Americans and Asian Americans.Latino activists have warned Democrats that merely attacking  Trump is not enough to win their votes, pressing for engagement on a range of issues.

WASHINGTON Hillary Clinton won the Puerto Rico Democratic primary on Sunday, moving her a step closer to prevailing over her rival, Bernie Sanders, in the fight for her party's presidential nomination. Clinton was the projected winner over Sanders in the U.S. island territory, according to NBC News.The win gives the former secretary of state a boost ahead of a big night on Tuesday, when six states, including New Jersey and California, will hold nominating contests.Clinton is hoping to cross the threshold of 2,382 delegates needed to secure the nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election as early as 8 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, when polls close in New Jersey.
She and Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, are in a dead heat in California. But delegates in the state are awarded on a proportional basis, so even a loss there for Clinton would not be likely to stop her from securing her party's nomination and a likely general election contest with presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.Ahead of Puerto Rico's nominating contest, Clinton had been just 60 delegates shy of clinching the nomination, when including superdelegates, who consist of party leaders and elected senators, members of Congress and governors.
Sanders is bracing for a prolonged fight that will run into the Democratic convention at the end of July.Networks reported huge voter turnout and long lines in Puerto Rico, with just over 430 polling stations open compared with over 2,000 in 2008.

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The corporate income tax is a major revenue source for the U.S. government, but it has been shrinking for decades and the three main presidential candidates could not differ more dramatically on what to do about it.Republican Donald Trump and Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have starkly contrasting plans, some more detailed than others, for taxing corporations.The tax paid by companies on their profits accounted for 30 percent of the U.S. federal tax base in the 1950s; last year, it was only 11 percent, Internal Revenue Service data show. The decline, experts say, has many causes: loopholes that cut corporations' taxes; a lower corporate tax rate; rising overseas profits that are lightly taxed; and a shift away from incorporation toward partnerships and other business structures that pay no corporate tax.Despite the dwindling corporate tax base, Trump, the Republicans' presumptive nominee for the Nov. 8 election, wants to ease the burden on companies by slashing the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. In this regard, he shares the same view as most Republicans.Trump, a real estate developer, has described his proposals as revenue neutral, saying reduced tax rates would be paid for by eliminating some tax breaks and repatriating corporate cash held overseas.However, the Tax Policy Center, a centrist tax research group in Washington, said that under Trump's plan, corporate income tax revenues would fall $1.9 trillion from 2016 to 2026.A cut on that scale would hugely expand the federal budget deficit, unless severe budget cuts or alternative tax hikes were also made, the center said.Steven Rosenthal, a Tax Policy Center senior fellow, said Trump's plan is a standard business-focused approach, but ""the drafting is incomplete, so we can't tell exactly what he's thinking.""  A Trump campaign spokeswoman pointed to the proposals on the campaign website but declined to comment further.
Republicans generally support corporate income tax cuts because, they say that would help corporations compete globally. In addition, some question the validity of the tax, which they say is passed on to consumers and investors.""Taxing businesses is the Democrats' version of manna from heaven: someone else supposedly is paying for the government. But all citizens are hurt through lower growth, higher prices, lower wages,"" said Grover Norquist, a Republican tax activist.""Taxes should be transparent. It should be clear who is paying them. The corporate income tax is designed to hide the tax burden,"" said Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a small-government group that opposes tax increases.CLINTON, SANDERS 

Democrats tend to view the corporate income tax as a fair levy on businesses that benefit from the security, services and infrastructure provided by government. Corporations have been taxed by Washington since 1909.Clinton, a former secretary of state and the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, has not promised a corporate tax cut.Like Trump, she has called for closing loopholes that corporations use to avoid taxes. But unlike Trump, her plan would raise corporate tax revenues by $136 billion over 10 years, the Tax Policy Center said.Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson said the candidate's proposals ""go further to prevent the erosion of the corporate tax base by ensuring corporations pay their fair share."" But the Clinton campaign has yet to release its full plan.Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont challenging Clinton for the Democratic nomination, would make more drastic changes and boost the corporate tax take by $1 trillion in the same decade, mostly by raising taxes on overseas profits, according to the Tax Policy Center.
""Virtually all of the revenue raised by Senator Sanders' corporate tax plan would come from large, multinational corporations that have shifted their profits offshore to avoid taxes,"" said Sanders policy adviser Warren Gunnels. FAIR SHARE?
The question of whether businesses pay their fair share of taxes strikes a chord with Americans on the campaign trail. An April Gallup poll found 67 percent of U.S. adults said corporations do not pay enough tax.   Since the mid-1950s, income tax receipts from individuals  have held steady at 40-50 percent of federal revenues, while payroll taxes, deducted from the paychecks of wage-earners, have soared to 34 percent last year from 5-10 percent in the 1950s.Meanwhile, Congress has steadily reduced the corporate tax rate, now 35 percent. That is down from 46 percent in 1986, and 52 percent in 1956. Over that period, corporations have also carved out various loopholes that let them avoid paying the full rate. The corporate tax applies only to incorporated businesses, while other business structures have been gaining in popularity. In 2003, the share of U.S. business income generated by incorporated companies fell below the share made by partnerships and other kinds of companies that pay no corporate tax. Whatever candidates may say on the campaign trail, no changes can occur without agreement by Congress. And despite years of talk about the importance of tax reform, neither President Barack Obama nor lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been able to agree on a reform agenda that many say is needed to boost the economy and bring sanity to a tax code of Byzantine complexity.

By Ginger Gibson and Sarah N. Lynch
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Senior U.S. Republicans distanced themselves on Sunday from Donald Trump's comments about a Mexican-American judge, saying they were worried that the tone of his presidential campaign could enrage Latinos, who are a growing U.S. voting bloc.Trump has accused U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel of harboring a bias against him in lawsuits involving fraud allegations against Trump University, the New York business man's now-defunct real estate school.The presumptive Republican nominee has suggested Curiel's Mexican-American heritage had influenced the judge's opinion because of Trump's campaign pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he ""couldn't disagree more"" with Trump's comments about the judge.""I am concerned about the Hispanic vote, America is changing,"" McConnell told ""Meet The Press"". ""I think it's a big mistake for our party to write off Latino Americans. I am concerned about that and I hope he will change his direction on that.""Democrats have accused Trump of racially tinged rhetoric about Latinos, including his description of Mexican immigrants as ""criminals and rapists"" in the speech he gave a year ago launching his campaign.Such rhetoric has exacerbated friction between Trump and Republican party leaders such as McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan. For the past few years, the party has been trying to broaden its appeal with Latino voters and senior Republicans are concerned that Trump's comments could cost the party votes, not only in the presidential race but in congressional races as well.
Former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has been mentioned as a possible running mate to Trump, called Trump's comments about the judge ""inexcusable.""""This is one of the worst mistakes Trump has made,"" Gingrich told Fox News.Curiel was born in Indiana to Mexican-immigrant parents.""He is a member of a club or society very strongly pro Mexican, which is all fine. But I say he's got bias. I want to build a wall,"" Trump said in an interview on Sunday on ""Face the Nation"".
Asked if he believed a Muslim judge would be biased against him based on Trump's call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, Trump replied, ""It's possible. Yes.""McConnell said America is a nation full of immigrants -- pointing out that his wife, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, came to the United States when she was eight and didn't speak English.""All of us came here from somewhere else,"" McConnell said.
Senator Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on ""ABC's This Week"" that he did not ""condone the comments"" that Trump made about Curiel.Legal scholars on the right and the left have criticized Trump for attacking the judge, saying it could harm judicial independence should he become president. Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who is of Mexican descent, was one of the few Republicans to defend Trump. Gonzales argued in a column in The Washington Post that Trump should be allowed to question a judge's fairness, saying that questioning a judge is crucial to ensuring public trust in the courts. But when asked about the racial element in an interview on Sunday on Fox News, Gonzales criticized Trump. ""I certainly would have taken a different approach,"" he said. ""Whenever you say something about a judge's nationality, I think it demeans the office and hurts the judiciary as a whole.""

I thought I'd just missed it. It was a bit tight on the last lap, I had to dig in,"" added Farah, who paid tribute to his boyhood hero Muhammad Ali before the race by striking a boxing stance.Former Olympic and world heavyweight champion Ali died on Friday aged 74 and Sunday's meeting held a minute's applause for the man known as 'The Greatest'.""He was a big hero of mine and I send all my condolences to his family and friends,"" said Somali-born Farah, who will defend  his titles in Rio in August.Kenya's Mathew Kiptanui was second in 7:44.16 with compatriot Hillary Maiyo third.
Kenyan David Rudisha, the Olympic 800m champion and world record holder, ran the second fastest 600m ever with his time of 1:13.10, not far off the world best of 1:12.81 in the little-run distance. He felt he could have gone faster.""I think I lost it in the last 100 meters,"" he said.Apart from Farah and Rudisha, there were four other world leading times at the meet including for Conseslus Kipruto of Kenya in winning the men's steeplechase in 8:00.12 and for his  compatriot Asbel Kiprop who took the 1,500 in 3:29.33.
Qatar's Mutaz Barshim won the men's high jump with a world leading leap of 2.37 meters, while Cuba's Yarisley Silva produced a year's best of 4.84 in the women's pole vault.

| ULAANBAATAR

ULAANBAATAR U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry hailed Mongolia as an ""oasis of democracy"" sitting in a tough location between Russia and China as he made a rare visit by a cabinet-level U.S. official on Sunday.Arriving from Paris, Kerry made the visit to Mongolia en route to Beijing to attend the eighth Strategic and Economic Dialogue, the high-level talks held between the United States and China each year.The Obama administration has sought to cultivate Mongolia as a partner, given its location between two increasingly assertive U.S. rivals - China and Russia, countries Mongolia relies on heavily for trade and energy imports.U.S. officials regularly tout Mongolia, a country of three million people, as an inspirational story of democratic transition since winning independence from the Soviet Union a quarter-century ago.""You really set a great example,"" Kerry told Mongolian and American embassy staff at the U.S. ambassador's residence.""You've got China on one side of you, and Russia on the other side of you, and there are always a lot of pressures, and here you are in this oasis of democracy fighting for your own identity.""
But Mongolia's democratic and human rights records have come under scrutiny.The 2015 State Department report on human rights in Mongolia noted ""vague laws and a lack of transparency in legislative, executive, and judicial processes"" that ""undermined government efficiency and public confidence and invited corruption.""Parliamentary elections are to be held this month, and democracy advocates have criticized a rule change by parliament last month that is expected to disadvantage smaller parties.
The lack of transparency in business regulations has hampered foreign investment, officials say, badly needed in an economy where growth has all but halted, far from a peak of 17.5 percent in 2011. Falling prices for its chief exports, coal and copper, and weak demand from China, by far Mongolia's biggest trading partner, are behind the slowdown.Kerry said it was important the Mongolian government implement a transparency agreement with the United States, which would provide greater business confidence to foreign investors. 
The Mongolian and U.S. governments signed the agreement in 2013 after years of negotiations but its final implementation has been mired in red tape. The agreement would commit Mongolia to publish in English an explanation for proposed regulations, and allow for public comments on those regulations, among other measures.""The implementation of this agreement is really key, a very important step to be able to attract foreign direct investment,"" Kerry said.
