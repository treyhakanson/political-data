CHESTER TOWNSHIP, Pa. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Thursday he would work with U.S. lawmakers if elected to tie federal funding and tax breaks for colleges and universities to a ""good faith"" commitment by them to lower tuition costs for students.""If universities want access to all of these federal tax breaks and tax dollars paid for by you,"" Trump told a rally in a Philadelphia suburb, ""they have to make good faith efforts to reduce the cost of college.""Trump did not offer specifics on how he would tie federal funding to changes in college tuition. His Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, has proposed making in-state tuition for colleges and universities free immediately for families earning $85,000 or less, and free by 2021 for families making up to $125,000 a year. 
Trump, a New York businessman, has not said much about the cost of college while campaigning. But U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who competed against Clinton for the Democratic nomination, made government-funded college tuition central to his campaign platform. 
Sanders drew a great deal of support from the youngest group of American voters, and Trump, who needs to win over more women and young people before the Nov. 8 election, took up a similar theme in his proposal.U.S. student debt has surged about 24 percent to around $1.2 trillion since 2012, according to figures earlier this year from the New York Federal Reserve, leaving many graduates with mortgage-sized tabs before they enter the workforce.

LOS ANGELES Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton played it strictly deadpan while parrying decidedly off-the-wall questions from comedian Zach Galifianakis on his online parody talk show, ""Between Two Ferns,"" released on Thursday. Galifianakis, star of ""The Hangover"" films, is known for his cringe-inducing banter on the web program, asking subjects awkward questions. Past interview subjects include Brad Pitt, Charlize Theron, Bradley Cooper and President Barack Obama.Sitting between two fern plants on a sparse set, Galifianakis did not dial back his trademark style of appearing uninterested and unprepared as he interviewed Clinton, riffing on her previous role as U.S. secretary of state in Obama's first term. ""As secretary, how many words per minute could you type? And how does President Obama like his coffee? Like himself - weak?"" Galifianakis said.""You know Zach, those are really out-of-date questions. You need to get out more,"" Clinton responded.
Other topics brought up included the comedian's interest in the designer of Clinton's signature pantsuits and whether her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, discussed romantic crushes with Ivanka Trump, daughter of Clinton's Republican opponent, Donald Trump, in the Nov. 8 election.In closing, Galifianakis made a wry reference to Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as America's top diplomat, which was investigated by the FBI.
""This has been a lot of fun, Mrs. Clinton. We should stay in touch. What's the best way to reach you? E-mail?""As a poker-faced Clinton looked on, Galifianakis hit a button to play AOL's famous email alert: ""You've got mail.""

By Emily Flitter
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, in remarks at an African-American church on Wednesday, praised ""stop-and-frisk"" policing methods that have aroused protests and successful legal challenges, for singling out minorities.The anti-crime tactic in which police stop, question and search pedestrians for weapons or contraband, gained traction in New York City under Mayor Rudy Giuliani, now a top Trump supporter.But opposition to the practice led police departments in New York, as well as Chicago and Newark, New Jersey, to agree to cut back on its use, in some cases submitting to outside monitoring and improving police training.""I would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to,"" Trump said, according to excerpts of a Fox News ""town hall"" in Cleveland, after a listener asked what he would do to reduce crime in predominantly black communities across the nation.""I see what's going on here, I see what's going on in Chicago, I think stop-and-frisk. In New York City it was so incredible, the way it worked,"" he added.  Ending the practice in New York was a key plank of Democrat Bill de Blasio's successful 2013 run for mayor.As the race between Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton tightens ahead of the Nov. 8 election, he has been reaching out to African-American voters, shown by opinion polls to largely favor Clinton.Trump has portrayed himself as the ""law-and-order candidate."" But Clinton has criticized many of his proposals as unconstitutional attacks on American freedoms.
Clinton's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump's statement.""Stop and frisk"" had saved lives and reduced crime in New York City under Giuliani, the Trump campaign said in a statement.""Mr. Trump believes that a locally tailored version of 'stop and frisk' should be used in Chicago to help reduce skyrocketing violence and make our Chicago safe again,"" spokesman Jason Miller said.
'WE ARE VICTIMS'
Anger over police tactics has risen as their fatal encounters with African-Americans, many of them unarmed, have sparked protests and unrest across the country.In his appeal to African-American voters, Trump has lamented the woes of black communities, asking those who traditionally vote Democratic to take a chance on him. But his often dire portrayals of their lives have left some black voters unmoved.   Connie Tucker, a pastor at Father Heart Ministries in Columbus, Ohio, said she liked policies that brought results, so if stop-and-frisk helped cut crime, she backed it.
But Tucker, who is white, said she sensed discomfort in the room at Trump's remarks. ""I felt like there was a pause,"" she said.     Another attendee, Geoff Betts, 38, who is black, said he felt dismayed by Trump's response.Betts, a hair products distributor, said he was registered to vote as an independent and attended to learn how Trump would try to win over black voters. He said he thought police unfairly discriminated against black citizens and that he opposed stop-and-frisk.""We are victims,"" he said, adding that he had walked out of the meeting. ""I just couldn't take it anymore, I had to go. I don't think that Donald Trump gets it.""

By Robin Respaut
| SAN FRANCISCO

SAN FRANCISCO A record number of local tax and bond measures will fill the California ballot this November, including over $32 billion of proposed funding for education, infrastructure and homeless services.Some 650 local measures will go before voters, including 427 revenue measures. That is considerably more than the number proposed during any of the last five gubernatorial or presidential elections, according to data compiled by the local government finance consulting firm CaliforniaCityFinance.com.Previously, the most measure-packed election was in November 2014, with 268 local revenue measures.California is one of 24 states that allow initiative rights to its citizens. Voter-approved measures are used to raise revenues for specific construction projects, change tax policy, or create new laws.     In the Golden State and nationwide, a boom in bond proposals  follows years of federal cutbacks to state and local programs, continued low interest rates and years of unmet infrastructure needs.The largest monetary requests by local municipalities in California include $3.5 billion for the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), $1.2 billion for Los Angeles homeless housing and services, and $950 million for affordable housing in Santa Clara County.
There are 184 local measures to fund public school and community college projects, totaling more than $25 billion. Michael Coleman, head of CaliforniaCityFinance.com, said the surge in education bond measures coincides with statewide Proposition 51, which authorizes $9 billion in general obligation bonds for public school facilities. Proposition 55 aims to increase education funding by extending upper income tax rates.""There's a lot of folks that think this is the time to go for a new school bond,"" said Coleman. ""They see it as a synchronous message, and time to get in line for matching funds.""The Nov. 8 election is a focus for statewide propositions as well. There are 17 in total, regarding issues ranging from marijuana legalization to the public cost of prescription drugs, tobacco taxes and the death penalty. 
The surge of ballot measures comes during an election year in which the presidential race is sure to draw large crowds to voting booths. There is also the lingering effect of low voter turnout during the November 2014 election that reduced the signature threshold for a proposition to qualify. Across the country, 74 citizen-initiated measures fill state ballots, more than double the number certified in 2014, according to Natalie Cohen, senior analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. Growing populist sentiment and frustration with traditional government contributed to the groundswell, Cohen wrote in a recent report about upcoming ballot measures.In California, some local measures are reactive to state propositions. For example, Proposition 64 aims to legalize recreational cannabis, and 37 local measures would create marijuana taxes for local cities and counties. 
Thirteen countywide measures would fund transportation improvements. ""That's coming from an acknowledged, pent-up demand for badly needed infrastructure repairs,"" Coleman said.Eighty-eight measures would increase or extend local sale taxes. Another 39 support parcel taxes for road improvements, fire and emergency services, hospitals and police. Parcel taxes are flat taxes on properties that originated after Proposition 13 severely limited property taxes in 1978. Three Bay Area measures would tax sugary beverages.

By Emily Stephenson
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Thursday proposed raising taxes on inherited property to 65 percent for the largest estates as she bolstered plans for tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans.Known by conservative opponents as the ""death tax,"" the estate tax, levied on property such as cash, real estate, stock or other assets transferred from deceased persons to heirs, currently is imposed only on inherited assets worth $5.45 million or more for an individual.Clinton's plan, posted on her campaign's website, would raise the estate tax from the current 40 percent to 45 percent, the rate that existed in 2009. But the biggest estates would face rates of up to 65 percent for property valued at more than  $500 million for a single person or $1 billion per couple, under her proposal, an update of an earlier plan.Clinton's proposed top rate of 65 percent would be the highest estate tax since the 1980s, and is in line with a proposal made during the Democratic primaries by her former rival for the party's presidential nomination, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. Her campaign said the boosted estate tax and a change in the rules to tax capital gains associated with inherited assets would help pay for other proposals to benefit middle-class people, such as expanding a tax credit for working parents.
Clinton's campaign said the plan would hit only the wealthiest people. ""Hillary Clinton has made a commitment throughout this campaign to make sure there is a plan to pay for the progressive policies we have laid out,"" said Mike Shapiro, an economic adviser to Clinton. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group focused on budget issues, said Clinton's new tax proposals including the estate tax changes, taxes on capital gains of inherited assets and other provisions would together raise $260 billion in revenue over a decade.
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, a wealthy real estate developer, wants to eliminate the estate tax. Clinton's proposal prompted criticism from conservatives ahead of her first debate with Trump on Monday night at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York.Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman, issued a statement decrying Clinton's ""dramatic hike in the death tax.""Republicans want to eliminate estate taxes altogether because they believe the system penalizes families who want to pass down businesses, said U.S. Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the tax-writing House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee.
Brady said in a statement that Clinton's plan was ""dead on arrival.""The nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said this month that only the estates of the wealthiest 0.2 percent of Americans, about two out of every 1,000 people who die, currently owe any estate tax because the first $5.45 million per person is exempt. Clinton would lower that exemption to $3.5 million. (Reporting by Emily Stephenson, Steve Holland and Amanda Becker; Editing by Will Dunham)"

By Steve Holland and Amanda Becker
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Democrat Hillary Clinton, suddenly vulnerable in the presidential race, is under pressure to deliver a strong performance against Republican Donald Trump in their first debate on Monday, a moment that could be the most consequential yet of the 2016 election.Political veterans involved in preparing for past presidential debates said Clinton should drive home how she would run the country during uncertain times and draw a contrast as the steady, experienced alternative to the untested Trump. For his part, Trump needed to show enough gravitas to convince skeptics that he is ready to be commander in chief, they said.The 90-minute face-off at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, the first of three debates, takes place at a time when Clinton's once-comfortable lead in opinion polls over the former reality TV star has evaporated.History shows that a single bad debate performance can alter the trajectory of a U.S. presidential race.  Reuters/Ipsos polling shows about 20 percent of the electorate remains undecided, far higher at this stage in the campaign than the 12 percent undecided four years ago. The TV audience for the debate is expected to be a record, easily surpassing the record 46.2 million households who watched the first encounter between President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, according to the Nielsen ratings company.    ""I am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and the bigotry that we have seen coming from my opponent,"" Clinton said on Tuesday on the Steve Harvey Radio show.Anita Dunn, who helped President Barack Obama prepare for debates against Republican nominee John McCain in 2008, said Obama succeeded at their first debate by steering the conversation repeatedly back to the struggling U.S. economy even though the event was supposed to be about foreign policy.She said she expected Clinton to try to exploit Trump's weaknesses and emphasize her strengths. ""The contrast between them is what you want to hone,"" she said.The debate will be the best opportunity for two candidates, both widely seen by voters as untrustworthy, to put to rest questions about their fitness for the White House with the Nov. 8 election fast approaching.Even the candidates' body language will be closely scrutinized, just as it has been in past elections.Brett O'Donnell, a debate coach who helped President George W. Bush in his 2004 debates and McCain in 2008, said Bush did not put in the necessary work for his first debate against Democrat John Kerry that year and it showed.Quickly put on the defensive, Bush blinked rapidly and slouched behind the lectern. Kerry was judged the winner. Bush got more serious about the debates after that, O'Donnell said.
Clinton had a shaky performance at a Sept. 7 NBC ""Commander-in-Chief"" forum where she became prickly in response to questions about her handling of classified emails while serving as U.S. secretary of state.""Presentation is very important, and Hillary has to work on that. Her presentation at the 'Commander-in-Chief' forum was not very good. She didn't come off as likeable. She came off as sour and defensive,"" O'Donnell said.TWO TRUMPS
Clinton is spending most of this week in debate preparations with a small circle of top aides at her home in Chappaqua, New York.Clinton aides said she is preparing for two scenarios: One in which Trump is measured and serious, and another in which he is freewheeling and makes inflammatory personal attacks.
Trump relied on his famed spontaneity to fire off one-line zingers to dismantle 16 Republican rivals during the primaries, dispatching ""low-energy"" Jeb Bush or ""lying Ted"" Cruz and ""little Marco"" Rubio. He has repeatedly called Clinton ""crooked Hillary"" at rallies.""You're just not sure who is going to show up,"" said Jennifer Palmieri, a senior adviser to Clinton. ""He may be aggressive or he may lay back. That's hard to game out necessarily so I would say most of the focus is on what points does she want to make.""A Trump supporter, Republican U.S. Representative Chris Collins of New York, said Trump understands that he needs to put forth a presidential demeanor.""I think the seriousness of that can't be understated and that we're going to see the debate prep making sure that she's not going to be able to pull him somehow off the message,"" he said.Rick Lazio, a Republican former congressman from New York, found Clinton a tough opponent when he faced her in a U.S. Senate debate in New York in 2000.He was seen as bullying, lost the debate and the election, and now says Trump will need to treat Clinton carefully.
""What he has to avoid is a sense that he is name-calling, highly disrespectful, badgering, anything like that,"" he said.ROLE-PLAYING
Former Republican Senator Judd Gregg, who played Democrats Al Gore and John Kerry in George W. Bush's mock debate sessions in 2000 and 2004, said Bush began preparing in early June unbeknownst to the news media and for a while did two practice sessions a day.For that reason, he said, he suspects Trump is doing more preparation work than he lets on.""I have to believe he is doing something because it would be foolish to go in there and not practice at hearing lines,"" he said.A Republican source close to the campaign said former Fox News Chief Executive Roger Ailes has been coaching Trump but that the former reality TV star does not want to be over-prepared.Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Trump is preparing for the debates but ""there's nobody who's playing the role of Hillary Clinton.""""Mr. Trump prepares for everything that he does,"" he said.

By Jill Serjeant
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Live, unscripted and unpredictable, the first 2016 U.S. presidential debate on Monday is expected to set new television audience records, with some commentators forecasting Super Bowl-sized viewership of around 100 million Americans. The face-off between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton at Hofstra University in the New York City suburb of Hempstead will be carried across multiple U.S. broadcast and cable networks without commercial breaks for 90 minutes.Political and media experts say the extraordinary nature of the campaign, featuring Trump, the outspoken N.Y. businessman and former reality TV star, vying for votes with Clinton, the former U.S. secretary of state and first woman to run for the White House, is expected to break the record TV audience of 80 million for the 1980 debate between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, according to Nielsen.""My prediction is a 100 million audience, and maybe more,"" said Paul Levinson, a communications professor at New York's Fordham University and author of ""McLuhan in an Age of Social Media.""""The Super Bowl shows that when there is something that is really special, something that can command people's interest, something you want to see on a big screen, television has this enormous power and reach,"" Levinson said.The National Football League's annual Super Bowl is the most watched television event of the year in the United States, with the 2015 game holding the record of 115 million viewers.
The 1983 finale of comedy series ""M*A*S*H"" holds the record for a non-sporting event with 105 million viewers, per Nielsen. This year's Academy Awards ceremony was watched by just 34 million Americans. The optimistic predictions for Monday's debate are fueled by the primaries' record audience of 24 million for the first Republican primary debate in August 2015 that was attributed to Trump's presence.Alan Schroeder, author of ""Presidential Debates: Risky Business on the Campaign Trail,"" said an audience of 100 million seemed possible, especially given Trump's wild-card nature.
""Normally we see candidates in very choreographed settings, and in situations where they are fully in control. (In the debates) they have to give that up and that makes it attractive to viewers - the sense of danger, of not knowing how it will play.""Add in the media hype with cable news channels showing count-down windows days in advance, and the first debate becomes must-see TV.Schroeder, a journalism professor at Boston's Northeastern University, compared the allure of Trump versus Clinton to the 2008 vice presidential debate between Republican Sarah Palin and Democrat Joe Biden. At 69.9 million U.S. viewers, it ranks as the second most viewed campaign debate ever.
""Palin was also a really compelling TV figure and had that same sense of danger around her,"" he said. Monday's debate will be broadcast at the same time as the popular Monday Night Football on ESPN, but Levinson doubted it would make a big dent in the debate audience.""It's not a crucial game, it's not a Super Bowl, it's not a playoff ... I think most football fans will feel they can afford to miss this game,"" Levinson said. (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)"

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A behind-the-scenes congressional battle to avoid a U.S. government shutdown broke into public view on Thursday when Republicans produced a stop-gap funding bill that Democrats immediately rejected.The federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30 and Congress must pass a spending measure by then to keep the government open. In recent years, lawmakers have seldom been able to agree on a full federal budget and instead have relied on stop-gap measures.Senate Majority Mitch McConnell capped weeks of labored negotiations by proposing a continuing resolution that would fund government agencies from Oct. 1 through Dec. 9 at an annual rate of just over $1 trillion. The measure also includes $1.1 billion to combat the spreading Zika virus, $500 million in flood relief for states including Louisiana and funding for U.S. military operations overseas at an annual rate of $74 billion. 
""There have been broad requests for a clean continuing resolution. So that's what I've just offered,"" said McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, who described the measure as a product of bipartisan negotiations.Democrats quickly opposed the resolution as ""a Republican-only bill"" that would not help Flint, Michigan, cope with lead-contaminated water and would leave in place a prohibition against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requiring public companies to disclose political spending.""We Democrats cannot vote for that,"" said Senator Barbara Mikulski, top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters that plans were already in place for an orderly government shutdown in the event that Congress cannot agree on a funding measure.McConnell left out a provision backed by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his former White House rival, Senator Ted Cruz, that would have stopped the U.S. government from moving oversight of the internet's technical management to a global community of stakeholders on Oct. 1.
Also absent was language that would have enabled the U.S. Export-Import Bank to approve loans or guarantees of more than $10 million. Republicans and Democrats had sought to include a provision, but the issue proved too controversial for the must-pass funding resolution.A senior Republican aide said the Senate would begin voting on the funding legislation as early as Monday.

The government has not publicly blamed Russia.Russia has denied it sponsors or encourages any hacking activity.
The lawmakers said the Russian effort was intended to sow doubt about the security of the U.S. election, and that the orders for intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from ""very senior levels"" of the Moscow government.""We call on President Putin to immediately order a halt to this activity. Americans will not stand for any foreign government trying to influence our election. We hope all Americans will stand together and reject the Russian effort,"" the statement said.
U.S. relations with Russia have had a high profile in campaigning for the Nov. 8 election, in which the White House, one third of the Senate seats and all the House seats are up for grabs.

By Gary Robertson
| RICHMOND, VA.

RICHMOND, VA. A U.S. appeals court on Thursday heard Virginia Democrats' challenge to a Republican-backed state law requiring prospective voters to show approved photo identification before casting ballots.The three-judge panel from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals repeatedly questioned attorneys about similarities between Virginia's 2013 statute and North Carolina's photo ID law. The appeals court struck down the North Carolina law in July, ruling that it intentionally discriminated against minority voters.The Virginia Democratic Party wants the law overturned, contending the measure was intended to counter its growing political clout in the state. Republicans say it was aimed at combating voter fraud.Judge Dennis Shedd asked attorney Bruce Spiva, who  represented opponents of the law: ""Was it as egregious as North Carolina's [law] was as seen by the court?""""Yes, your honor,"" said Spiva.""Was the motive in Virginia as bad if not worse?"" Shedd asked, referring to the intent of racism found by the court in North Carolina's law.
""As bad, your honor,"" Spiva said. He added that the law was especially burdensome for minorities and young people, who tend to vote Democratic.Mark Hearne, who defended the state measure, said the Virginia photo ID law was different from North Carolina's.Among other factors, Hearne said, there had been ""no evidence of discriminatory intent"" as the court found in the North Carolina case.
The appeal ahead of the Nov. 8 elections is among several legal challenges around the United States to voter identification laws that were driven by Republicans, who argue that they prevent election fraud.The appeals panel did not say when it might rule.U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson in May had upheld the law passed by the Republican-led legislature and signed by then-Governor Robert McDonnell, also a Republican. He said the ""inconvenience"" to potential voters was not enough to merit striking it down.
Democrats have made gains in the state, once a Republican stronghold. President Barack Obama won the state in 2008, boosted by turnout among black, Latino and young voters, and again in 2012.Virginia's governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and both U.S. senators are Democrats. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton also leads Republican opponent Donald Trump in Virginia opinion polls.In the North Carolina case, the U.S. Supreme Court last month rejected a request by the state that the restrictions be reinstated for the Nov. 8 election.
