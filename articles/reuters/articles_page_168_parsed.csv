WASHINGTON President Barack Obama said on Saturday that the prevalence of guns in U.S. society is one factor behind American violence and the fact that there was a gun in the car contributed to the shooting of a black Minnesota man last week.""In Minneapolis, we don't know yet what happened, but we do know that there was a gun in the car that apparently was licensed but it caused, in some fashion, those tragic events,"" Obama told reporters. ""We can't just ignore that and pretend that that's somehow political ... it is a contributing factor -not the sole factor - but a contributing factor to the broader tensions that arise between police and the communities where they serve.""

By Jonathan Allen
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Hillary Clinton disputed a scathing assessment by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that she was ""extremely careless"" with classified government secrets, saying on Friday she relied on the judgment of her subordinates at the U.S. State Department.After maintaining for more than a year that she did not send or receive classified information through her unauthorized private email system, she acknowledged in a string of interviews on Friday she may have at least unwittingly done so, three days after the FBI concluded this happened at least 110 times.Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said she ""certainly did not believe"" that she was handling classified information on her email system at the time, but emphasized that she followed the lead of her subordinates on whether information was classified.""I did not have a basis for second-guessing their conclusion,"" Clinton said in an interview with CNN, saying she had the ""highest regard"" for her former colleagues.""These are experienced diplomats, they have expertise in handling classified material,"" she said in a separate interview with PBS Newshour. ""They were not careless and the material that they sent, they did not believe that was classified.""
Clinton, who was the department's most senior classifying authority during her four-year tenure at its helm, did not address the FBI's conclusion that she herself sent information on topics classified as 'top secret', the highest level, through a private server she kept in her basement. ""I have said, and I repeated, that it was a mistake to use personal email and I regret that,"" she said in another interview with ABC.It is a crime to mishandle classified information, and while FBI Director James Comey said on Tuesday there was evidence Clinton or her aides may have broken these laws, there was not enough evidence of criminal intent for a prosecution.
In an unusual 15-minute announcement explaining the FBI's findings, Comey ended up dismaying both Republicans and Democrats.While Clinton's Republican opponents have fumed at the decision not to file criminal charges, Clinton and her staff have disputed some of Comey's criticisms that undermine her argument that she has better judgment than Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate.
Comey called her and her staff ""extremely careless"" and said that any ""reasonable"" government employee should have recognized that such information should not be aired in emails. Her server was so poorly secured the FBI could not eliminate the possibility it had not been hacked by the country's enemies, Comey said.Asked if she agreed that she was ""extremely careless"", Clinton told CNN she was not, adding that Comey had ""clarified"" his remarks. It was unclear what clarification Clinton meant.In lengthier comments before lawmakers on Thursday, Comey again spoke of Clinton's and her staff's carelessness and ""real sloppiness"", adding that it seemed she was not ""particularly sophisticated with respect to classified information.""

By Chris Kahn
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Americans' demand for an alternative to the two main presidential candidates has surged since the last election, a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll shows, underscoring the unpopularity of Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton.Based on 2,153 interviews, Friday's poll results suggest a strong potential for a third-party candidate - like Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party or Jill Stein of the Green Party - to take enough of the vote in the Nov. 8 presidential election to influence its outcome.According to the July 1-8 poll, 21 percent of likely voters will not back Trump or Clinton. That compares with about 13 percent of likely voters who opted out of the two main choices at the same point in the 2012 race between incumbent President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney.The poll also showed a majority of American voters have an overall ""unfavorable"" view of both main candidates, with 46 percent of Clinton supporters and 47 percent of Trump supporters saying their top priority when voting will be to stop the opposing candidate from reaching the White House.Demand for an alternative could be decisive in hotly contested battleground states. In Florida in 2012, for instance, Obama won by less than 1 percentage point. If this year's race is just as tight, third-party candidates could draw enough support to flip the state from one major party to the other.Despite this, both Johnson and Stein have a problem that  make their influence hard to predict - most voters still do not know who they are. Of likely voters, 23 percent say they are at least ""somewhat familiar"" with Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico. That drops to 16 percent for Stein, a physician.SPOILER ALERT
Johnson could appeal to both liberals and conservatives. He wants to legalize marijuana and replace income and payroll taxes with a consumption tax. 
Stein could make a strong bid to backers of U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who ran a close race with Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination. Stein wants to abolish student debt and raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. She also aims for the country to run on renewable energy by 2030. Stein's communications coordinator, David Doonan, said that the campaign is working to boost her numbers and that the Green Party is circulating a letter that directly appeals to people who supported Sanders. ""He also started very low"" in the polls, Doonan said. So far it appears that Johnson and Stein draw support evenly from Clinton and Trump when they are included in opinion polls. In a four-way race, 45 percent of likely voters support Clinton, 34 percent Trump, 5 percent Johnson and 4 percent Stein, according to a separate five-day polling average on July 8. That compares with 46 percent for Clinton and 33 percent for Trump in a two-way race. Given a little more information about the two alternative candidates, respondents who back Johnson and Stein draw more deeply from Clinton's support.
Some 44 percent of likely voters support Clinton, 34 percent  Trump, 7 percent Johnson and 5 percent Stein, after reading the following statement, according to the poll: ""Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate for President, has taken an environmental position supporting a strong government role limiting carbon-based fuels, such as coal. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate for President, has supported severely limiting the government's role, including slashing taxes and reducing programs such as Medicare and the military and broadly decriminalizing currently illegal drugs.""The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English with American adults in the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii. The survey of voters who want an alternative to Trump and Clinton included 2,153 likely voters and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points. The five-day average poll that ended July 8 included about 1,240 likely voters and has a credibility interval of 3 percentage points.<^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^U.S. Presidential Election 2016     cpurl://apps.cp./cms/?pageId=us-2016

By Steve Holland

In the hours after a gunman shot 12 police officers, killing five in Dallas, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton abruptly canceled campaign events. Their Twitter accounts largely went quiet.The shootings marked yet another convulsive event in the 2016 political season, one in which Clinton and Trump have scrambled to find the right response to terror attacks abroad, mass shootings at home, and protests over police killings of African Americans.Much of the violence, captured live on smartphones and endlessly replayed on cable television news, has fueled Americans' fears about their personal safety, polls show. It has  evoked memories of 1968, when civil rights leader Martin Luther King and Democratic presidential candidate Robert Kennedy were assassinated in a turbulent era of protests against the Vietnam war and racial segregation.""We're seeing wild acts of gun violence and we are polarized in our politics and in the public square,"" said historian Douglas Brinkley. ""Every 48 hours there seems to be some horrific event that jars and jerks our consciousness into a new dimension.""Historically, uncertain times tend to push the party out of power. Witness Republican Ronald Reagan's defeat of incumbent Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1980 during the Iran hostage crisis, or Obama's victory over Republican John McCain in 2008 as the U.S. economy collapsed.But that may not be the case for Trump, who has yet to convince a majority of Americans that his would be a steady hand at the tiller.Trump's initial reaction to Dallas suggested he understands the stakes. He issued a sober statement of unity that was unlike many of his public utterances that are often derided by critics as hyperbolic or inflammatory.""Our nation has become too divided. Too many Americans feel like they've lost hope. Crime is harming too many citizens. Racial tensions have gotten worse, not better. This isn't the American Dream we all want for our children,"" he said.
""This is a time, perhaps more than ever, for strong leadership, love and compassion. We will pull through these tragedies.""  BRIDGING THE DIVIDE
With race relations becoming a more prominent issue in the White House race, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a top contender to be Trump's vice presidential running mate, told Fox News that Trump and his No. 2 can help broaden their appeal by going to inner cities, where many African Americans live.In responding to the spasm of gun violence, Clinton has called for more regulations on the gun industry and has aligned herself with the Black Lives Matter movement, which campaigns against violence against African-Americans.
In a round of TV appearances, Clinton said she had been working her whole life to try to bridge the racial divide. Her comments follow the police shooting of two black men in two separate incidents in Louisiana and Minnesota over the past week. The Dallas gunman told police he was angry about the killings.""I will call for white people, like myself, to put ourselves in the shoes of those African American families ... who fear every time their children go somewhere. I'm going to be talking about white people,"" Clinton said on CNN.Democratic strategist Bud Jackson said she is hitting the right tone.""I don't think this is an issue that she needs to take advantage of,"" he said. ""In fact it would probably hurt her if she is perceived as taking advantage of it."" 
But the demand for change is sweeping among voters. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken over the last five weeks, nearly two-thirds of Americans feel the country is on the wrong track, reflecting their general unease with the economy, terror threats and violence.""Her challenge is to show she can cope with these issues and that she would bring change and would not be the same,"" said presidential historian Thomas Alan Schwartz.Trump has said a Clinton win in the Nov. 8 election would amount to a third term for President Barack Obama. Clinton has embraced many of the policies of her former rival in the 2008 presidential election and campaigned with him this week.Lanhee Chen, who advised 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney and 2016 presidential candidate Marco Rubio, said a more civil discourse in American politics would help to calm people's general fears. ""I think there's bigger issue around civility and rhetoric and discourse and how our leaders appeal or don't appeal to our better angels. That's really what this is about. I see this as an absence of leadership all around.""

Fourteen years after criticizing Augusta National Golf Club for its all-male membership policy, women's issues expert Martha Burk has called for next year's U.S. Women's Open to be moved from Trump National in New Jersey.In a blog for The Huffington Post on Friday, Burk lambasted tournament organizers, the United States Golf Association, for placing ""profit over principle"" and added a link to a petition to force the USGA to hold the event elsewhere.""Seems the USGA, no stranger to hypocrisy, refuses to move next year's U.S. Women's Open from the Trump-owned Bedminster club, even though the USGA issued a public statement condemning Trump's racist views after his 'Mexican rapist' rant when he announced his candidacy,"" Burk wrote.Republican presidential candidate Trump has angered many people with his polarizing words on the campaign trail, including his promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, deport 11 million illegal immigrants and temporarily bar Muslims from entering the country.His antagonistic comments have already cost him in the golfing world.The elite PGA Grand Slam of Golf, a 36-hole stroke-play event that features the winners of the season's four majors, was scrapped last year due to complications over the proposed venue, Trump's National course in Los Angeles.
Last month, the PGA Tour announced that its long-established tournament in Miami would move from Trump's Doral course to Mexico City next year, a switch prompted by sponsorship issues.With the 2016 U.S. Women's Open being played this week at CordeValle in San Martin, California, Burk has turned her attention to next year's edition, even though ""the protest is not over exclusionary policies at Bedminster, if there are any"".She wrote: ""The objection is to one of the ruling bodies of golf kowtowing to Trump's overtly racist and sexist views. That shows where the USGA really stands, despite the lip-service-only condemnation a year ago.""
The USGA, PGA Tour, LPGA and PGA of America had distanced themselves from Trump's explosive comments in a joint statement issued last August.Burk referenced the Augusta National controversy, saying ""the USGA ignored its prohibition against holding events at clubs that discriminate on the basis of race or gender by standing solidly behind the Trump-like dinos holding the Masters Tournament - even though it was clearly in violation of their own by-laws.""Augusta National's membership policy had been an issue for years, most notably in 2002 when Burk led a series of protests that prompted a heated war of words with Augusta's then-chairman Hootie Johnson.
""There may well come a day when women will be invited to join our membership, but that timetable will be ours, and not at the point of a bayonet,"" Johnson declared at the time.Augusta National, home of the Masters golf tournament, finally ended an all-male policy that had endured for 80 years when it announced in August 2012 that two women would be admitted as members for the first time.Burk, a co-founder of the Center for Advancement of Public Policy, is director of the corporate accountability project for the National Council of Women's Organizations.

By Kim Palmer
| CLEVELAND

CLEVELAND Cleveland police on Friday tightened their security plan for the Republican National Convention after the deadly shootings of police officers in Dallas, increasing surveillance and intelligence operations just 10 days before the convention.Other police departments across the country required officers to patrol in pairs rather than alone following the ambush in Dallas, the deadliest day for police in the United States since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington.In Cleveland, the attack raised another potential threat during the July 18-21 convention, when Donald Trump is expected to receive the Republican nomination for president. The police officers' labor union, rank-and-file cops and some outside experts had already questioned Cleveland's preparedness for the convention with the city's police under federal supervision over use of force.Ten days before the event, Cleveland was still training police officers for duty at the convention, which is expected to draw 50,000 visitors as well as clamorous protests and crown the most contentious presidential candidate in memory.Rather than a security team reinforced by the country's largest police departments as it hoped, the city has cobbled together 3,000 officers, mostly from state agencies, who will use borrowed and rented equipment.""When the convention was awarded to Cleveland (in 2014), folks weren't thinking about this.... Yes, there is a generalized worry,"" said Matthew Barge, court-appointed monitor for the U.S. Justice Department's oversight of Cleveland police.CLEVELAND POLICE CONFIDENT    
Ed Tomba, the city's deputy police chief and head of convention security, had previously told Reuters he was ""very, very confident"" in the city's convention plan. He reiterated that confidence in a telephone interview on Friday in response to the Dallas attack.
""We have got to make some changes without a doubt,"" Tomba said, mentioning the surveillance of potential threats from street level and farther away.  ""We will have plenty of people watching over different locations. We are beefing up the intelligence component, too. They are going to be very, very active,"" Tomba said.Police throughout the United States ordered their officers to work in pairs following the shooting in Dallas, including those in New York, Chicago and St. Louis.New York officers will ""double up"" on all assignments and auxiliary police officers who are unarmed except for night sticks will not be used in the field for the next few days, Police Commissioner William Bratton told a news conference.St. Louis police also will be required to wear ballistic vests when leaving any station for enforcement activities, Chief Sam Dotson said on Twitter.
Tomba said he spent part of Friday morning reassuring out-of-town police departments that their officers on loan to Cleveland will be safe during the convention, telling them in an email that ""we cannot pull the plan off without them.""Cleveland police union President Steve Loomis has been among the most vocal critics, complaining that front-line officers would be undertrained and poorly equipped. ""They are setting up my guys for failure,"" Loomis said before the Dallas attack.Civic leaders have said Cleveland is experiencing a renaissance following decades of decline, and that reputation will be on the line during the convention.Two separate incidents of fatal police shootings in recent years have brought unwelcome national attention to the city.
In 2012, 13 Cleveland officers fired 137 shots into the car of an unarmed African-American man and his female passenger, killing both. The U.S. Justice Department investigated and imposed special federal oversight known as a consent decree that remains in force.Then in 2014, four months after the Republicans chose Cleveland for the convention, a white police officer shot dead 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was black, in a case that became a national focal point for the protest movement Black Lives Matter. The most recent report from the federal monitor overseeing the Cleveland consent decree portrays a police department where physical infrastructure is strained, with computers and cars ""run-down or deficient,"" forcing police to pay for repairs out of their own pockets and use their personal vehicles for police  work. Loomis, the union leader, said half of Cleveland police officers have yet to receive convention training.That number is ""probably close,"" Tomba said on Thursday.Upon getting the convention, Cleveland asked 200 police departments to send officers, including those from big cities which generally have the best anti-terrorist schooling.Many big cities turned Cleveland down, saying they were unable to spare officers, Tomba said.But Cleveland has exceeded its goal by bringing in 3,000 reinforcements who will receive training at home plus a short course upon arriving, Tomba said.

By Letitia Stein
| TAMPA, Fla.

TAMPA, Fla. A federal grand jury indicted U.S. Representative Corrine Brown of Florida and her chief of staff on fraud charges and other crimes, accusing them of funneling money for a bogus education charity to personal use, U.S. prosecutors said on Friday.The 69-year-old Democrat from Jacksonville, Florida, denied that she had used her political position to help raise more than $800,000 that donors believed supported college scholarships and other educational purposes. According to the 53-page indictment filed in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida this week, funds donated to the group One Door for Education were used to pay for a golf tournament honoring Brown, luxury box seats at a Beyonce concert, a football game and other personal expenses.Prosecutors noted that the organization was not properly registered as a non-profit group and awarded only two scholarships totaling $1,200.""I am innocent of the charges announced today, and intend to vigorously defend myself in court against these politically motivated allegations,"" Brown said in a statement.
She said she would temporarily step down from her role as the Ranking Member of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Veterans' Affairs due to House rules.The 24-count indictment also accuses her chief of staff, Elias ""Ronnie"" Simmons, 50, of multiple counts of fraud.There was no immediate response from Brown's office to requests for comment from Simmons. 
During a court appearance on Friday, Brown and Simmons pleaded not guilty, local media reported.""It is incredibly disappointing that an elected official, who took an oath year after year to serve others, would exploit the needs of children and abuse the charitable hearts of constituents to advance her own personal and political agendas and deliver them with virtually nothing,"" Michelle Klimt, special agent in charge of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation division in Jacksonville, said in a statement.Brown was elected to Congress in 1992 as one of the first three black members of Florida's congressional delegation since the Reconstruction period following the Civil War. Now seeking re-election, she faces a primary challenge in a redrawn district.
Her indictment follows the June conviction of U.S. Representative Chaka Fattah of Philadelphia for orchestrating multiple frauds to enrich himself and preserve his political career. He subsequently resigned.Prosecutors said Simmons misused his position to help a relative obtain government employment and receive more than $735,000 without doing work. They said he diverted more than $80,000 of his relative's salary for his own personal use.Brown is also accused of falsifying her tax filings.

By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK The November U.S. presidential election is being sold by the major parties as a defining moment for the next generation of Americans. But stock and options traders, often moved to action by political headlines, are responding with a big 'meh.'Options bets on volatility around the Nov. 8 election are running lower than could be expected given how stocks have performed in past election cycles, BNP Paribas said.Typically, stock market volatility picks up around presidential elections. Traders use options to guard against outsized market reaction to such events.The CBOE Volatility Index, the most widely followed gauge of near-term investor anxiety, had some big spikes this year, hitting a four-month high after the Brexit vote. But there is little to suggest that November is a big worry for stocks.Investors are focused on the quarterly earnings season starting next week. They might also be taking the view that both the Republican and Democratic prospective nominees would be more favorable for business than the current administration, analysts said.""It's like the opposite of 'Alien vs. Predator,'"" said Mark Sebastian, chief investment officer at volatility arbitrage hedge fund Karman Line Capital in Chicago, referring to the 2004 American science fiction film which had the tagline 'whoever wins, we lose.'
""Here, no matter who wins, Wall Street does better,"" he said.Despite being called anti-business by some on Wall Street, the Obama administration has been in power over one of the best presidential cycles for stocks on record.WHERE IS THE FEAR?

Per BNP Paribas data, S&P 500 Index options forward implied volatility, which measures volatility expectations embedded in options, shows no dislocation over the remaining election campaign period.Had there been a big bump-up in this measure for November it would have been a sign that traders were loading up on protective contracts.""The market is not ascribing a large probability to a high volatility scenario over the election period,"" said Stewart Warther, an equity derivatives strategist at BNP Paribas.
Market-makers, or dealers which quote prices for options, are also not expressing a great deal of anxiety over stock gyrations.If stock volatility does not pick up in November, that would be a departure from the norm, according a BNP Paribas analysis of data going back to 1948.""The shape of the (volatility) curve definitely is upward sloping but it's not like there is a huge hump out in November,"" said Steve Sosnick, an equity risk manager at Timber Hill, the market-making unit of Interactive Brokers Group Inc.""We have seen some demand for options but I would say it's hardly a frenzy.""

| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON The U.S. House of Representatives' special Benghazi committee approved its report on Friday on the attack in Libya that killed four Americans in 2012, but the Republican-led panel set no date for ending its work after a two-year-long investigation.The committee's chairman, Republican Representative Trey Gowdy, said the panel voted to approve the 800-page report, with seven Republicans in favor and four Democrats opposed, in a closed-door meeting.Republicans had issued the report on June 28. It included no major new revelations about the assault in Benghazi that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.But it criticized presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time of the violence, saying both she and her staff showed a ""shameful"" lack of response to congressional investigators looking into the attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound. 
It also accused Clinton's State Department of failing to protect the Americans killed. Last October, Clinton, already a Democratic presidential candidate, calmly deflected harsh Republican criticism of her handling of the attack during a testy 11-hour hearing before Gowdy's committee.Democrats have derided the report as a political vendetta against the former secretary of state. Republicans said the committee's work would not wrap up until materials related to the report are reviewed for classified information and potential perjury claims, which would be referred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
""If you thought a vote today would be the end of this partisan chapter of our history, you would be wrong,"" Representative Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the panel, said in a statement.""The Select Committee is poised to last for months - perhaps until right before the presidential election - and that appears to be the Republican plan,"" Cummings said.
Republicans plan more interviews, including one next week with Stephen Hedger, the head of legislative affairs at the Department of Defense, Cummings said.Panel Republicans issued a joint statement calling the investigation ""a great privilege and honor."" They urged President Barack Obama's administration to clear for public release all of the supporting evidence and documents referenced in the report.

By Luciana Lopez and Amanda Becker
| NEW YORK/WASHINGTON

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON Hillary Clinton has found herself in the middle of a fight within the U.S. Democratic Party over the Pacific Rim trade pact, between President Barack Obama, who backs the deal, and opponents whose help is crucial to her White House bid.A showdown over trade is expected on Friday and Saturday when Democratic officials meet in Orlando, Florida, to negotiate language for the party's 2016 platform, which sets policy priorities intended to guide campaign messages in the Nov. 8 election.Different factions of the party are deadlocked over platform language on the sweeping Trans Pacific Partnership, which Obama hopes to push through the U.S. Congress later this year.The current draft, which will be ratified at the July 25-28 Democratic convention in Philadelphia, acknowledges ""a diversity of views"" over the TPP.While the platform is not binding for candidates, it is a symbol of a party's core values.Labor unions and other TPP critics have called for a clear condemnation of the pact, which they fear could lead to steep U.S. job losses in manufacturing. But some Democrats say that would risk undercutting Obama.U.S. Representative Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, a Clinton appointee to the platform committee, told the Washington Post that while he had a long history of opposing trade pacts, he did not want Democrats on the other side of the issue to think they are not important.Gutierrez also said he thought ""disregarding the position of the president of the United States"" was not right.The intra-party rift has created a quandary for Clinton, the Democrats' presumptive nominee. She has staked out opposition to the TPP during her campaign after supporting it while she was secretary of state in the Obama administration.
Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has accused her of waffling on trade. Trump has strongly condemned the deal, calling it ""horrible.""CLINTON'S DILEMMA
If Clinton embraces platform language condemning the TPP, it would please unions while causing difficulties for Obama, one of her most enthusiastic supporters.
Moreover, if the platform committee cannot come up with language that satisfies Bernie Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont who had also sought the nomination and still wields considerable clout, the fight might drag into the Philadelphia convention and create a messy spectacle where Democrats will formally nominate Clinton for the White House.Labor unions told the Clinton campaign of their frustrations in a closed-door meeting on June 30. One of a series of occasional sessions to update unions supporting her on campaign staffing, logistics and other issues, it concluded with a brief question-and-answer session where AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka asked about the pact.""The (platform's) language now is unacceptable,"" Hasan Solomon, the legislative director of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, told Reuters. The machinists were the first industrial union to endorse Clinton and remain strong backers of her candidacy.Union activists aligned with Sanders were even more blunt.""When I saw the language, my reaction was: 'What are they thinking?'"" said Rafael Navar, national political director for the Communications Workers of America, which endorsed Sanders.
""The only way to challenge Trump's appeal to millions of working-class voters in critical swing states is to be 100 percent crystal clear on opposing TPP and other job-killing trade deals.""Many union activists also voiced their opposition to the deal to Paul Booth, executive assistant to the president of the American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees, at a private June 1 meeting hosted by the AFL-CIO. Booth is among the platform drafting committee members suggested by Clinton.To push for changes to the TPP platform language, Sanders has encouraged his millions of supporters in emails and texts to register their dissatisfaction.But Obama's support for the deal makes it hard for the party to come out against it too forcefully, said Jamal Simmons, a Democratic political consultant with the Raben Group. Meanwhile, the platform committee expects more amendments to be offered in Orlando. ""The point of this process,"" said committee spokeswoman Dana Vickers Shelley, ""is to hear what people's concerns are.""
