WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate will vote to renew sanctions on Iran for 10 years before adjourning next month, the chamber's Republican leader said on Wednesday, sending the bill to the White House, where President Barack Obama is expected to sign it into law.The House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday for the decade-long extension of the Iran Sanctions Act, or ISA, first adopted in 1996 to punish investments in Iran's energy industry and deter the country's pursuit of nuclear weapons.The act will expire at the end of 2016 if it is not renewed.""We're going to take up the House bill,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters at the Senate's weekly Republican leadership news conference. ""... And we're going to pass it.""The Obama administration and other world powers reached an agreement last year in which Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.
But members of Congress said they wanted the ISA to stay in effect to send a strong message that the United States will respond to provocations by Iran and give any U.S. president the ability to quickly reinstate sanctions if Tehran violated the nuclear agreement.White House officials have said they did not think the reinstatement was needed, now that the nuclear agreement has been in effect for almost a year. But they also have not raised concerns that a renewal would violate the deal.
Apart from the ISA, the nuclear agreement's longer-term future became more uncertain when Republican Donald Trump was elected president on Nov. 8, and Republicans kept their majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives.Every Republican in Congress opposed the nuclear agreement. And Trump was harshly critical of it as he campaigned.

WASHINGTON A congressionally-appointed panel on Wednesday called for the creation of a U.S. museum of women's history, with preferred sites on or near Washington's National Mall.The American Museum of Women's History would close a gap in the U.S. capital, which has museums devoted to everything from space and spies to stamps and black history, but none focused on women, its backers said.""America needs and deserves a physical national museum dedicated to showcasing the historical experiences and impact of women in this country,"" said the report from the seven-member commission - all women - empaneled by Congress in 2014.Creation of the museum would call for a decade-long effort to gather support and funding and to build it. The cost for a building of 75,000 square feet (6,900 square meters) to 90,000 square feet (8,400 square meters) would be estimated at $150 million to $180 million in private funds, the report said.The commission also recommended that Congress donate land free of charge for the museum site or provide an existing building.
The museum would become part of the Smithsonian Institution, the world's biggest museum complex, overseen by a board also appointed by Congress. The federal government would assume operation and maintenance costs.The panel recommended three sites for a women's museum on or around the National Mall, a vast area stretching two miles (3.2 km) from the U.S. Capitol west to the Lincoln Memorial and often called ""America's front lawn.""
One site is on the side of the Mall opposite the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in September.The second site is the Smithsonian's 19th-century Arts and Industries Building, also on the Mall, and the third is on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol.
Congress declared the Mall closed to new building in 2003, but made an exception for the African American museum. With the Mall already crowded with monuments and museums, Washington planners are looking for ways to pay tribute to U.S. historical figures and events away from the area.

By David Ingram
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Wednesday he told Donald Trump during a private meeting that fear is gripping communities in America's largest city over the U.S. president-elect's vows to crack down on illegal immigrants.The Democratic mayor and the wealthy Republican New York real estate developer traded insults during the campaign, but met for about an hour inside Trump's skyscraper headquarters.Afterward, de Blasio said he expressed his concerns about Trump's policies toward immigrants, as well the need for tough Wall Street regulation and protecting the rights of racial and religious minorities.De Blasio, who supported fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton against Trump in last week's election, said the two men had a candid and substantive discussion.De Blasio said he told Trump immigrant families should not be torn apart by deportations, and that the police tactic supported by Trump of stopping and searching people on the street can drive a wedge between minorities and law enforcement.New York historically has been a city filled with immigrants. According to census data, 37 percent of New York City's 8.6 million residents are foreign-born, far above the national figure of 13 percent. ""I tried to express to him how much fear there is - how much fear there is in communities all over this city,"" the mayor told reporters outside Trump Tower. 
During the campaign, Trump called for the deportation of all of the estimated 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally. Trump said in a TV interview aired on Sunday his priority was to remove up to 3 million immigrants who have criminal records or are gang members or drug dealers, and would decide on the others after the U.S. border is secured.The mayor last Thursday said New York would remain a sanctuary city shielding illegal immigrants, adding that ""we are not going to sacrifice a half million people who live among us, who are part of our community.""Trump has said he may want to place some U.S. mosques under surveillance and suggested he may want to maintain a national database of Muslims. The New York Police Department has 900 officers who are Muslim, de Blasio said he told Trump. The mayor declined to say what Trump's responses had been.
""I think they both said it was a very productive meeting,"" Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said separately, adding that the president-elect is open to speaking with a variety of people.Trump during the campaign called de Blasio the worst mayor in America and in New York City's history. The mayor during the campaign called Trump dangerous and ""one of the worst demagogues in recent U.S. political history.""Trump grew up in the New York City borough of Queens and still makes Manhattan his primary residence. Trump has not said whether he will continue to live part-time in New York after he takes office on Jan. 20.
De Blasio said he spoke to Trump about the importance of tough banking regulations and of tax cuts that do not favor the wealthy. Trump has promised a ""dismantling"" of the Democratic-backed 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law enacted following the financial crisis, and has promised deep tax cuts.The mayor expressed some optimism that Trump would follow through on a campaign pledge to spend more on infrastructure.Trump said during the campaign he would rebuild America's infrastructure including highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools and hospitals.""It would have a hugely positive impact on millions of New Yorkers, and hopefully put a lot of people back to work,"" de Blasio said.

By David Brunnstrom
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will seek reassurances from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on U.S.-Japan ties on Thursday and a senior adviser to Abe said he had been told that campaign remarks calling the alliance into question should not be taken literally.Abe is due to meet Trump in New York on Thursday and is expected to be the first foreign leader to meet the president- elect since his election last week.Trump's transition team has not responded to requests for comment on the meeting, but an adviser to Trump, speaking anonymously, said this week that Trump would seek to reassure Abe and other Asian allies rattled by his campaign rhetoric.Trump had fanned worries in Tokyo and beyond with his comments on the possibility of Japan acquiring nuclear arms and demands that allies pay more for the upkeep of U.S. forces on their soil or face the possibility of their withdrawal.Katsuyuki Kawai, an adviser to Abe sent to set up the Trump meeting, said he had spoken to several Trump advisers since arriving in Washington on Monday.""I have been meeting with so many top aides to the president-elect and also I have been meeting with the very distinguished senators and congressmen and they unanimously told me that we don't have to take each word that Mr. Trump said publicly literally,"" he told Reuters.Kawai said that among the Trump advisers he had met were Representative Devin Nunes, Senator Tom Cotton, and the presidents of the conservative Heritage Foundation and Hudson Institute think tanks, Jim DeMint and Ken Weinstein.Kawai said the fact that Abe would be the first foreign leader Trump would meet since winning the presidency on Nov. 8 was ""a meaningful signal"" and Abe's aim was ""to establish the highest level personal ties with the president-elect.""""That meeting will be the first for building up the great personal relationship between two leaders,"" he said.""Prime Minister Abe will definitely talk about the importance of the Japan-U.S. alliance and that alliance is not only for Japan and the United States, but also for the entire Indo-Pacific region as well as world politics.""
SETTING THE TONE
A Trump adviser, who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said he expected the meeting to ""set the tone"" for Trump's relations with Japan and the region. ""I think the message ... is going to be extremely reassuring,"" the adviser said. ""I expect he is going to reaffirm his commitments to the alliance and the American commitment to being in the Pacific long-term.""The adviser said Japan's financial support for U.S. troops in Japan might come up but was unlikely to be a focus.Some diplomats say that until Trump makes key appointments, it will be hard to assess his policies on issues ranging from overseas deployments of U.S. troops, China's maritime aggressiveness in Asia and North Korea's nuclear threat.A day before the Trump-Abe meeting, Japanese officials said they had no idea exactly when the meeting would take place, where in New York it will happen, who will be invited or whom to call for answers.
Japanese and U.S. officials said on Wednesday the State Department had not been involved in planning the meeting, which has left the logistical and protocol details that normally would be settled weeks in advance still to be determined.""There has been a lot of confusion,"" said one Japanese official.Abe, a political blue blood and veteran lawmaker, and Trump, a brash outsider with no diplomatic or government experience, have sharp differences on policy issues such as free trade.But the two may find they have much in common, including pledges to restore their countries' global stature and a desire to counter a rising China while improving relations with Russia.""Prime Minister Abe and Mr. Trump will have good chemistry,"" said Takashi Kawakami, a professor at Tokyo's Takushoku University. ""Both tend to decide and act based on intuition. And both are pragmatists who put their countries' interests first.""Kawai said Abe considered the U.S. relationship Japan's most important and that it was essential that it was built on trust.
""That is why the prime minister wants to build the highest level personal ties with Mr. Trump,"" he said.Some of Trump's rhetoric suggests an image of Japan forged in the 1980s, when Tokyo was seen by many in the United States as a threat to jobs and a free-rider on defense.His election also has dashed hopes for U.S. approval of a 12-nation trade pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a linchpin of Washington's ""pivot"" to Asia and a pillar of Abe's economic reforms.But Abe's personal attitude about defense appears to be viewed more positively in the Trump camp, even if it would like Japan to do more.Since taking office in 2012 Abe has boosted Japan's overall defense spending while stretching the limits of its pacifist post-war constitution to allow the military to take a bigger global role.""Frankly, the prime minister has been more assertive and forthright in trying to make those changes to Japan's global posture,"" the Trump adviser said. ""I think he's going to get a very receptive audience there."" Japan agreed last December to boost spending for U.S. forces in Japan by 1.4 percent for the next five years, at an average of 189.3 billion yen  ($1.74 billion) per year. Defence Minister Tomomi Inada has said Tokyo was paying enough.However, defense spending still stands at just over 1 percent of GDP against over 3 percent in the United States.

BERLIN European leaders and President Barack Obama on Friday will discuss extending sanctions imposed on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine, and possible new sanctions for its bombing in Syria, sources familiar with the plans said.The meeting in Berlin, hosted by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and including the leaders of Britain, France, Italy and Spain, comes a little over a week after Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election.Trump has indicated that he will seek a rapprochement with Russia, raising doubts in Europe about the future of the sanctions regime introduced by Washington and Brussels in 2014 following Russia's intervention in eastern Ukraine.A German official said the plan was to agree a rollover of EU sanctions against Russia, which are due to expire at the end of January, in the coming weeks.There is concern that Trump might move in the opposite direction after his inauguration on Jan. 20. European leaders will therefore be seeking clarity from Obama, who met Trump last week and said afterwards the president-elect would maintain core relationships around the world, including with NATO.Obama arrived in Berlin on Wednesday evening after visiting Greece. 
""We're in a really critical situation,"" said the German official. ""We have to prevent a situation where the EU rolls over the sanctions and then the new U.S. president comes in and lifts them.""Obama and Merkel are expected to hold talks on Thursday followed by a news conference at which they will raise the issue of Syria, a source said.European officials fear that Russia will use the time before Trump's inauguration to launch new offensives in Syria and Ukraine. Two diplomatic sources said the issue of Syria would also come up at the Friday meeting.
""Syria will definitely be on the agenda,"" said one, citing coordinated Russian missile strikes against rebels in Syria launched on Tuesday from an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean.The Kremlin has said it is maintaining a moratorium on air strikes in the city of Aleppo.European Union leaders last month condemned Russia for its bombing of civilians in Aleppo and signaled that they could introduce new sanctions for its actions there if the bombing continued.
The Syrian opposition has been pressing Western countries to expand sanctions to include some Russian firms that are supplying weapons and bank notes to Syria.Syrian opposition leaders are due to meet with EU leaders, including EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, in Brussels on Friday.Another source said European leaders were keen to send a signal to Trump, making it more difficult for him to reverse U.S. policy and cosy up to Russia.

By Michelle Nichols and Nathan Layne
| NEW YORK

NEW YORK Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is now the leading candidate to become President-elect Donald Trump's secretary of state, but even some Republicans say his tough-guy personality and global business ties may be at odds with international diplomacy.Giuliani, 72, has been one of Trump's most vocal and high-profile supporters, and according to sources close to him and Trump, he is eager to become the top U.S. diplomat and expects a decision by Trump as early as next week. The other top candidate, the sources said, is former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, a foreign policy hawk.New York mayor at the time of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks by al Qaeda militants, Giuliani is also considered a hard-liner on national security matters, but he has little diplomatic experience.Still, some prominent Republicans said he is qualified to take command of U.S. diplomacy at a time of chaos in the Middle East, rising nationalism in much of Europe, and growing challenges from Russia and China.Senator Lindsey Graham, a respected conservative voice on defense and foreign policy who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee and who made a rather short-lived bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, on Tuesday called Giuliani ""competent and capable"" of being secretary of state. ""Rudy is an internationally-known figure. He's a personal friend. He has dealt with the unimaginable, which was 9/11. He's a loyal supporter of President Trump. He should be rewarded in my view,"" Graham told reporters.Giuliani himself extolled his foreign policy credentials in an interview with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity on Tuesday. ""I've been in 80 countries, 150 different foreign trips,"" Giuliani said. ""A lot of it for different reasons. Speeches. Security consulting, where I helped bring down crime.""
Critics, however, said they are troubled not only by Giuliani's combative nature and lack of experience, but also by his international business ties and his lucrative speaking engagements for an Iranian exile group that was on the U.S. terrorism list until four years ago.The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its consideration of Giuliani for secretary of state.FOREIGN ENTANGLEMENTS?
After serving as New York mayor for eight years, Giuliani founded management and security consulting firm Giuliani Partners in 2002, which he left in 2007 when he campaigned for the Republican presidential nomination and questions were raised about his foreign business ties. 
The firm's clients have included Colombia and, reportedly, the government of Qatar. Giuliani appears to have resumed work with the firm after his 2007 failed presidential bid, and is listed as chairman and chief executive officer of Giuliani Partners on the Giuliani Security and Safety website.He joined a Texas law firm as a name partner in 2005. The firm did lobbying work for Citgo, a U.S. subsidiary of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, which at the time was  controlled by President Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's late socialist ruler. At the time, Giuliani's office said he was not personally involved in the lobbying and said Giuliani believed that ""Chavez is not a friend of the United States.""Giuliani's dealings in Russia may face scrutiny in Senate confirmation hearings. His ties to TriGlobal Strategic Ventures, a consulting firm that helps Western clients advance their business interests in emerging markets of the former Soviet Union, date back to 2004, when Giuliani visited Moscow to meet Russian businessmen and politicians, according to the company's website.The consulting firm's president, Vitaly Pruss, has ""created and developed strategies"" for companies including Russian oil pipeline monopoly Transneft and has ""worked closely"" with Giuliani Partners, according to his profile on TriGlobal's website. State-owned Transneft was among Russian oil companies targeted with sanctions by Western powers following Russia's annexation of Crimea under President Vladimir Putin.
Giuliani also has spoken in support of the People's Mujahedin Organization of Iran, a group of Islamic leftists who opposed Iran's late shah, but fell out with the Shi'ite clerics who took power after the 1979 revolution and later aligned itself with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. The U.S. government considered it a terrorist organization until 2012.Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who also was a contender for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, told CNN on Tuesday he was worried about Giuliani's ties to foreign governments.    ""Whether or not you have divided loyalties obviously is very important,"" Paul said. ""I hope Donald Trump will pick somebody consistent with what he said on the campaign trail - Iraq war was a mistake, regime change in the Middle East is a mistake.""You want to have a diplomat in charge of diplomacy,"" he said.Critics, however, say the bottom line is that Giuliani is no diplomat, either personally or professionally.   ""The challenge for Giuliani if he becomes secretary of state would be to move beyond the tough guy persona he cultivated as prosecutor and mayor and instead stand up for some of the basic principles of human rights, democratic accountability, and the rule of law that enhance rather than shrink America's influence abroad,"" said Ken Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, who worked for Giuliani when he was a federal prosecutor between 1983 and 1987.

By Patricia Zengerle

WASHINGTON Senior Democratic and Republican U.S. lawmakers want Washington to respond to Russia's alleged interference in the U.S. election and actions in Ukraine and Syria, despite Republican President-elect Donald Trump's calls to improve relations.Senator Ben Cardin said on Wednesday he was working on what he described as ""comprehensive"" legislation to respond to Russian actions contrary to U.S. interests in Europe and Syria, as well as cyber attacks blamed on Moscow during the campaign.""Russia presents a very serious challenge for America. They're not our partner. They're a bully,"" Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters. ""Whether you attack us by MiG (fighter jet) or by mouse, it's an attack. It requires a response. It's clear that they were responsible for the cyber attack on our country in this past election,"" Cardin said.Other lawmakers have also called for action against Russia as they returned to Washington this week for the first time since Trump won the Nov. 8 U.S. election.
On Tuesday, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, one of his party's senior foreign policy voices, told reporters he wanted Senate hearings on whether Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered in the election.""We can't sit on the sidelines,"" Graham said. 
During the campaign, Trump's Democratic rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, criticized him for praising Putin as a strong leader and saying ties with Russia should be improved at a time when Moscow and Washington are at odds over Syria and Ukraine.Trump also worried U.S. allies with comments questioning NATO's mutual self-defense pledge and suggesting he might recognize Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region.Cardin declined to provide specifics about his legislation ahead of a planned speech on Thursday on Russia policy. When asked if it would include additional sanctions, he said, ""It will be comprehensive.""
He said he thought it would be difficult to pass a bill before the current Congress wraps up next month, but that he hoped to lay the groundwork for future action.Cardin also said he wanted Obama to act before he leaves office on Jan. 20. Congress has already passed legislation giving the president the authority to take actions including imposing additional sanctions or sending more arms to Ukraine.

PRAGUE Czech President Milos Zeman has thrown his support behind a bid by Ivana Trump, the ex-wife of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, to become the next ambassador to the country of her birth.""They could not send a better U.S. ambassador to Prague,"" Zeman told her in a telephone call on Wednesday, the president's office said in a statement.Ivana Trump told the New York Post last week she would suggest to her ex-husband that she become ambassador to the Czech Republic.The 67-year-old socialite, born in Zlin in what was then Czechoslovakia, told the paper the country was ""where I'm from and my language and everybody knows me"".Her suggestion, reported by Czech media over the weekend, has been welcomed by other politicians but most enthusiastically by the president's office, whose spokesman said on Twitter it was a great choice.
It was another sign of a sharp pro-American U-turn by the Czech presidential administration.Zeman was one of the few European politicians who vocally backed Trump in his campaign for the U.S. presidency.After the real estate billionaire won the election in a surprise victory a week ago, Zeman held a rare press briefing in which said he was ""very happy"" with Trump's victory and that the two shared opinions on immigration and terrorism.
Like Trump, the outspoken Czech president has often railed against ""elites"" critical of his leadership and has warm views towards Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Unlike Trump, Zeman is very keen on deepening ties with China.Despite his country's NATO membership, Zeman has often repeated the Russian line on the conflict in Ukraine and was not invited to the White House under President Barack Obama. 
He has had an open feud with current U.S. ambassador to Prague, Andrew Schapiro. In 2015, he ""closed the door"" of Prague Castle to the envoy for a time, after he made comments perceived as critical of the Czech president's decision to attend a World War Two commemoration in Moscow.The president's spokesman, Jiri Ovcacek, tweeted last week that ""a beautiful gift for my January birthday will be the exit"" of the current ambassador.

By David Morgan
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A co-author of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's tax plan called on Congress Wednesday to pursue corporate tax reform as a bipartisan ""jobs"" bill that could finance a massive new infrastructure program while slashing business tax rates.Stephen Moore, a Heritage Foundation fellow who advised the Trump campaign, said he would recommend that Trump pursue tax reform along two tracks, by focusing on business taxes in his first 150 days and leaving the politically more challenging task of reforming individual taxes for later.Trump and Republicans in Congress are trying to hammer out a legislative agenda on tax reform.Moore, at a forum hosted by Politico, called for a plan that would attract Democratic support, suggesting an outcome that could deviate markedly from the House of Representatives blueprint promoted by Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican.Trump's proposal would reduce the official corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, allow corporations to repatriate overseas profits at a 10 percent rate and reduce the top individual tax rate to 33 percent from 39.6 percent.  
Moore estimated that the cuts would lead to a revenue loss of about $3 trillion over 10 years, for which Trump would compensate with spending cuts. But he said it would broaden the tax base by adding 1 percent of growth to the U.S. economy.  ""That's the plan: try to pass a tax cut ... and then make up the difference by cutting government spending,"" he said.But some analysts warn of a bigger toll. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center forecasts that the Trump plan would cause the federal debt to soar by $7 trillion over its first decade, including added interest costs and macroeconomic effects.
Trump and Congress would be able to sell the legislation as a job creation bill by linking corporate tax reform to infrastructure spending, Moore said. The combination would also increase the chances of gaining support from Democrats, who have favored such a link.""I would label this a jobs bill,"" Moore said.
Moore estimated that taxing repatriated overseas corporate profits could raise $100 billion to $150 billion for infrastructure spending. U.S. corporations are estimated to have $2.6 trillion in profits stashed overseas.He spoke to House Republican whip Steve Scalise and other lawmakers on Tuesday about using reform to fund infrastructure. ""The disagreements, I think, on the Republican side of the aisle, are very easily reconcilable,"" he said. (Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by James Dalgleish)"
