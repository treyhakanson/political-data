By Jon Herskovitz
| AUSTIN, Texas

AUSTIN, Texas Abortion providers in Texas reacted with surprise and elation on Monday to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to throw out the state's restrictive abortion law and said they aimed to reopen some clinics shut down since the measure was passed in 2013.Since the law was passed by a Republican-led legislature and signed by a Republican governor, the number of abortion clinics in Texas, the second-most-populous U.S. state with about 27 million people, has fallen from 41 to 19.""I am honestly surprised by the Supreme Court decision,"" Rachel Bergstrom-Carlson, health center manager at Planned Parenthood of Austin, said at the clinic that performs about 250 abortions per month in the Texas state capital.But Bergstrom-Carlson said she does not think the ruling ""all of the sudden creates open access"" to abortion for Texas women or that it means other legislation intended to restrict women's access to safe and legal abortions will be scrapped.Abortion providers said the law imposed medically unnecessary regulations that were intended to shut clinics. Texas state officials said the law was aimed at protecting women's health.Dr. Bhavik Kumar, who performs abortions at Whole Woman's Health clinics in Texas, said abortion providers will seek to reopen some of the shuttered clinics but do not expect to be able to return to the number in operation prior to the law.
Negotiating new leases and hiring staff will mean a slow return to operations for those that do re-open, Kumar said.The Supreme Court ruled that both key provisions of the law - requiring abortion doctors to have difficult-to-obtain ""admitting privileges"" at a local hospital and requiring clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities - violated a woman's right to an abortion established in a 1973 landmark ruling.""I am beyond elated,"" Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder and CEO of Whole Woman's Health, which operates four abortion clinics in Texas and spearheaded the challenge to the law.
""After years of fighting heartless, anti-abortion Texas politicians who would seemingly stop at nothing to push abortion out of reach, I want everyone to understand: you don't mess with Texas, you don't mess with Whole Woman's Health,"" she added.If the Supreme Court had left the law in place, only eight clinics would have remained open, including the Planned Parenthood facility in Austin, a U.S. lower court judge said.The state's Republican leaders, including the governor and attorney general, criticized the ruling that they said would endanger public health.
""Now abortion clinics are free to ignore these basic safety standards and continue practicing under substandard conditions,"" Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said. ""By its ruling, the court held that the ability of abortion clinics to remain open - even under substandard conditions - outweighs the state's ability to put women's health and safety first.""The legislature meets again next year, and top lawmakers indicated they may look at new abortion restrictions.The ""admitting privileges"" provision, requiring doctors who perform abortions to have formal affiliation with a hospital within 30 miles (48 kms) of their clinic, had gone into effect. The facilities standards had been put on hold by courts. (Reporting by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Will Dunham)"	[]	['abortion']

By Jilian Mincer

The battle over abortion was expected to shift to measures focusing on the fetus in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision striking down a Texas law enacted in the name of maternal health.The 5-3 ruling held that Texas clinic regulations put an undue burden on women seeking abortion, a right established in the court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.The ruling could affect similar laws in more than a dozen states and stands as the biggest affirmation of abortion rights in more than two decades. Opponents said they would regroup, turning their attention to defending and expanding laws that ban abortion after 20 weeks gestation or sooner.But this path could be difficult as well. The Supreme Court has not taken up any outright ban on abortion tied to fetal gestation in decades and has repeatedly rejected pleas by states to endorse such laws.""We believe that, even before today, these laws were very likely to be struck down because they are unconstitutional bans on abortion,"" said Emily J. Martin, general counsel for the National Women's Law Center. ""Today's decision only strengthens that conclusion.""
Abortion opponents acknowledged the defeat but vowed to press on.""The pro-life movement takes two steps forward and, occasionally, a step backward,"" said Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee.More than a dozen states now have provisions banning abortions after 20 weeks, ""and, and we are going to be pushing that,"" Tobias said.
Nebraska enacted the first 20-week ban in 2010. Since then, similar laws have been adopted in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research organization that supports abortion rights. Mississippi's law bans abortion after just 18 weeks.Abortion opponents said they also planned to step up efforts encouraging states to limit second term abortions through bans on the use of dilation and extraction method. Nine of 10 abortions in the United States are performed in the first trimester. But the dilation and extraction method is the most common procedure used for second trimester abortions.Kansas and Oklahoma adopted bans on the procedure last year, but those laws have been blocked by courts. West Virginia, Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana passed laws this year; none has yet to draw challenge.
The Supreme Court has turned away state efforts to revive bans struck down by lower courts. Earlier this year, it rejected Arkansas' bid to revive a ban on abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy. The Supreme Court turned away North Dakota's effort to revive a law that banned most abortions once a fetal heartbeat could be detected, as early as six weeks after conception. And, in 2014, it declined to hear Arizona's appeal of a lower-court ruling invalidating a ban on the procedure at 20 weeks.Before Monday, the last time the court had taken up an abortion rights case was in the 2007 dispute over a federal ban on a procedure critics call ""partial birth abortion."" The procedure, known medically as ""intact dilation and extraction,"" involves a physician removing most of the fetus intact rather than dismembering it.By a 5-4 vote, the court upheld the procedure. Writing the majority opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy referred to moral issues and Congress's findings that the procedure would not be necessary for the health of the mother. In Monday's case, Kennedy joined the majority decision that the Texas law lacks the medical benefits to justify the burden it places on women's access to abortion.

WASHINGTON U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Monday called on the Senate to take immediate action this week to address Puerto Rico's $70 billion debt crisis before the critical July 1 deadline for the island territory's next debt payments.""The Senate should take up the matter immediately,"" Lew said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. ""Delay will only jeopardize the ability of Congress to conclude its work before July 1, a critical deadline Puerto Rico's leadership has publicly highlighted for months.""If no action is taken, the crisis there will only ratchet higher, he said in the letter. Puerto Rico faces a deadline on Friday to pay off $2 billion of its debts.Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said later in a floor speech that the vote would take place on Wednesday. ""I really do think that we can go ahead and support the bill,"" he said. A senior Republican aide could not confirm that a vote would take place on Wednesday.   
The financially ailing island is staring down $70 billion worth of debt that it says it cannot repay in full, adding to its 45 percent poverty rate and rising emigration to the U.S. mainland that is also cutting into its economic growth.The Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives already passed legislation to address Puerto Rico's debt before leaving Washington for the July 4 holiday break. The Senate is expected to recess at the end of this week.
The House bill, a rare piece of bipartisan legislation,  would establish a federal oversight board to negotiate various debt restructurings while seeking to institute balanced budgets on the island, a U.S. territory with 3.5 million residents.Lew called on senators to also pass the House measure - the ""Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act,"" or PROMESA - this week to get it to President Barack Obama to sign into law before Friday's payment deadline.
The Senate, also controlled by Republicans, is expected to debate the measure this week, but Democrats have said they want changes - a move that could complicate its passage. A vote is expected this week. (Reporting by Susan Heavey and Dan Bases, additional reporting by David Morgan; editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Andrew Hay)"	['Inhofe', 'McConnell', 'Obama']	[]

By Richard Cowan and Daniel Bases
| WASHINGTON/NEW YORK

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK After months of waiting for the U.S. Congress to act as Puerto Rico's economic crisis progressively worsened, the Caribbean island is on the verge of securing a relief plan from Washington aimed at helping it address a hobbling $70 billion debt.The Senate is set to launch a debate on Wednesday for legislation establishing a federal oversight board that would be in charge of restructuring the U.S. territory's debt where one out of every three dollars it earns in revenue is used to pay creditors, according to the U.S. Treasury.""We're not going to let Puerto Rico go off the cliff here. It's too important,"" said Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.The measure is identical to the plan passed by the House of Representatives earlier this month, as Congress tries to send it to President Barack Obama to sign into law by July 1. That is when Puerto Rico faces a potential default on a chunk of its debt if it cannot make a $1.9 billion payment. As early as Wednesday, the Senate could cast a procedural vote on the bill that, if successful, would clear the measure for passage this week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also took steps to limit amendments that can be offered to the bill.Some Democrats have complained about the makeup and operation of the oversight board that would be appointed by Washington as well as provisions demanded by House Republicans that potentially could lower minimum wages for some younger workers.""Something needs to be done. We would really love some amendments on key issues like the composition of the board, the procedures for taking Puerto Rico into the bankruptcy court, and then especially, the labor provisions on overtime and minimum wage,"" Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia told reporters.But any amendments would delay Congress' work on the bill and make it impossible to get to Obama before July 1, as the House of Representatives would have to sign off and it is in recess until July 5, after the Independence Day holiday weekend.
TREASURY'S LEW CALLS FOR PASSAGE 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew reiterated his call for the Senate to pass the bill on Monday, saying if nothing is done by the Friday deadline, the debt crisis will only ratchet higher.Puerto Rico is reeling from a 45 percent poverty rate, a steady flow of outward migration to the U.S. mainland that further shrinks its tax base and the shuttering of essential services.
If Congress does not pass the ""Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act,"" or PROMESA, before July 1, the island could default on all or part of the debt payment, including General Obligation bonds that are senior to all credits.""The Senate should take up the matter immediately,"" Lew said in a letter to McConnell. ""Delay will only jeopardize the ability of Congress to conclude its work before July 1, a critical deadline Puerto Rico's leadership has publicly highlighted for months.""While Puerto Ricans want some sort of relief from the debt their government is saddled with, many of the 3.5 million residents, who are U.S. citizens, nonetheless worry that the proposed seven-member oversight board will trample on San Juan's self-governing rights.""The bill is not perfect. I do not like the board. I do not like that it doesn't add a mechanism to make our economy grow, but what is the alternative right now? That is why I call on the Senate to vote for this bill,"" Puerto Rican Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said during a panel discussion last week in Washington.
Without PROMESA, an existing trickle of lawsuits could turn into a flood.In April when there was little sign of congressional action, Puerto Rico's legislature passed a local debt moratorium law giving Garcia Padilla the authority to withhold debt payments.Investors on June 21 filed a lawsuit in U.S. federal court calling the Puerto Rico Emergency Moratorium and Rehabilitation Act illegal.""We are at the mercy of the judge,"" Garcia Padilla said during the panel discussion.PROMESA, if signed into law, puts an immediate stay, or hold, on any future lawsuits and is retroactive to December 2015. The stay remains in effect until the debt has been restructured to a sustainable level with the goal being an orderly restructuring an sustainable amount of debt.

By Dustin Volz
| WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON A Democratic senator on Monday prevented legislation from being quickly considered that would expand the FBI's power to use secretive surveillance orders to obtain some Internet records, arguing it would lead to a ""dramatic erosion"" of U.S. privacy rights.  Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon placed a hold on the annual Intelligence Authorization Act, which grants congressional approval for clandestine operations carried out by the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies.A provision of the authorization bill would allow the Federal Bureau of Investigation to use national security letters, which do not require a warrant, to compel companies such as Alphabet Inc's Google and Facebook to hand over certain Internet records. These would include email metadata, some browsing history and social media log-in information.Such an expansion would allow the FBI to retrieve sensitive data of U.S. citizens without court approval, Wyden said. ""Convenience alone does not justify such a dramatic erosion of Americans' constitutional rights,"" he said on the Senate floor.
National security letters are the latest flashpoint in a years-long debate pitting U.S. surveillance operations against digital privacy interests.Wyden's objection blocks the Senate from rapidly advancing the bill and now forces Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell to go through normal order to hold a roll call vote, a process that can take days.
Currently, national security letters, or NSLs, can only compel sharing of phone billing records, according to a 2008 legal memo written by the U.S. Justice Department. Still, the FBI has used the letters since then to request Internet records during national security investigations.Senate Republicans have attempted to advance the NSL expansion, which FBI Director James Comey has called his top legislative priority, several times in recent months.Last week the Senate came two votes short of advancing separate legislation that would have expanded national security letters. [uL1N19E0ZY]
Though some Republicans invoked the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando earlier this month to promote that measure, Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said last week it was ""one hundred percent correct"" that it would not have prevented the massacre.Wyden also said he opposed another provision of the authorization bill that would limit the jurisdiction of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, a government advisory committee that reviews the legality and effectiveness U.S. surveillance programs.

TORONTO Only one-in-four Canadians say the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is good for their country, and more than one-third want it renegotiated, according to polling results released ahead of a North American leaders' Summit on Wednesday.The survey from the Angus Reid Institute on Monday come as protectionist sentiment swells in the United States, where voters at both ends of the political spectrum question the economic benefits of NAFTA.The U.S. Congress is hesitating to ratify a new 12-nation trade pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which also includes Canada and Mexico.Trade has long been a focus at the so-called ""Three Amigos"" summits between NAFTA members, Canada, the United States and Mexico, held this year in Ottawa.The matter has also become a lightning rod issue in the election campaign to replace U.S. President Barack Obama, who wants Congress to ratify TPP before he leaves office on Jan. 20.
Republican Donald Trump, his party's presumptive nominee for 2016, has attacked the TPP and describes NAFTA as a disaster that needs to be renegotiated or shelved. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has also said she opposes the TPP.Angus Reid Institute's poll showed also one-quarter of Canadians feel NAFTA hurts the country, while half were either unsure or feel the deal has had no impact either way. 
The institute's executive director, Shachi Kurl, said the survey contrasts with past polls on other trade deals, in which Canadians were more likely to support than oppose them. ""Is this simply a gap in policy makers' adequately convincing Canadians that this has been a good deal?"" she said. ""Is NAFTA an exception in that Canadians see the specific trade deal as a bad deal? These are questions that we have to think on.""
Kurl added the poll raises the question of whether Canadians are concerned about the effects of NAFTA in itself or whether their opinion is part of the global ""grumpy view"" on trade, citing U.S. anti-free-trade sentiments.Angus Reid said it conducted the online survey with a representative sample of 1,519 Canadian adults who are its members. The survey has a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. (Reporting by Ethan Lou in Toronto and Roberta Rampton in Washington; Editing by Sandra Maler)"	['Reid', 'Clinton']	[]

By Roberta Rampton and David Ljunggren
| WASHINGTON/OTTAWA

WASHINGTON/OTTAWA President Barack Obama will meet with the leaders of Canada and Mexico on Wednesday for his final ""Three Amigos"" summit, a meeting that may signal how keen the North American partners are to tout trade at a time of rising protectionist sentiment.The Ottawa summit comes on the heels of Britain voting to leave the European Union after more than 40 years. It also falls ahead of a U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8 where presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has made stagnant wages and U.S. manufacturing job losses focal points of his insurgent campaign.The so-called Brexit vote is bound to be an important theme for Obama's meetings with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Canada had negotiated a trade deal with the EU that is slated to take effect next year. The Brexit may delay its ratification and hurt Canada's commodity-driven economy.The referendum results are also seen as a setback to talks on a U.S.-EU trade deal. Mexico, which already has a trade deal with the EU, has prepared a draft proposal for a pact with the United Kingdom.At the summit, leaders will also look at how best to foster trade with each other, said Mexico's Finance Minister Luis Videgaray.""One of the important issues, without doubt, is how to give a fresh impulse and greater value to North American integration,"" Videgaray said.All three are part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation trade deal that Obama had cast as an update of the North American Free Trade Agreement. He wants to finalize the TPP as part of his economic legacy in Asia.The TPP has become a target of both the left and the right in the U.S. election, and Congress has so far been unenthusiastic about ratifying the deal.CLEAN POWER OVER TRADE
The United States is the top export market for both Canada and Mexico. In 2015, U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico totaled $663 billion and $584 billion, respectively.
But in Canada, only one in four people say the 22-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is good for the country, a poll released on Monday showed.The long-running Canada-U.S. battle over softwood lumber seems more likely than not to resume as early as October.Given all the controversy over trade, the leaders may decide to try to focus their summit talking points on other topics.""I expect them to try and stay away from it,"" said Carlo Dade, director of the Canada West Foundation's Center for Trade and Investment Policy.Ahead of the summit, the White House revealed that the leaders would commit to a new regional goal of 50 percent of power coming from clean energy by 2025, up from about 37 percent in 2015.The three countries also plan to unveil a plan to fight heroin production.
TRUMP QUESTION INEVITABLE
At a joint press conference, the leaders are likely to field questions about the upcoming U.S. election and its implications for both Canada and Mexico.It will also be Obama's first chance on an international stage to promote his recent endorsement of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of state.In March, Pena Nieto roundly condemned Trump, who has promised to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs, and has complained about what he calls unfair trade. Mexico also named a new ambassador to aggressively promote its contributions to the U.S. economy.On Canada, Trump has so far been mostly silent. 
""That doesn't mean Canadians don't feel the sting"" of his protectionist ideas, said Chris Sands, director of the Center for Canadian Studies at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies.Trudeau is likely to tread carefully so as to not endanger relations with a potential president.""It's unlikely there will be any formal discussion of Trump, who of course is the elephant in the room. In some ways, it's better if there isn't,"" said one official involved in the summit.""The message the leaders will be sending is eloquent enough - the three nations are closely integrated and cooperate well and that's how the relationship should work,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.On trade, Pena Nieto and Trudeau are also cognizant that talk is cheap on the campaign trail.""I have to tell my Canadian friends this often - it doesn't mean it will be the agenda once you get to the White House,"" said David Wilkins, the U.S. ambassador to Canada from 2005-09 during the George W. Bush administration.Obama provides a good case in point. In his 2008 presidential campaign, he demonized NAFTA, but once in office, he began working on the TPP, a deal he has said would fix his concerns about NAFTA.""There's very much a 'Keep calm and carry on' approach and we're going to ignore some of the domestic politicking and see what happens when it happens,"" said a Canadian source familiar with the summit talks.

By Amanda Becker
| CINCINNATI

CINCINNATI Liberal Elizabeth Warren attacked Republican Donald Trump on Monday during her first campaign appearance with U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, calling him an ""insecure money grubber"" who is driven by greed and hate. Warren, a leader of the Democratic Party's progressive wing and a potential vice presidential pick, said Clinton had spent her career fighting for liberal values while Trump, a wealthy real estate developer, was focused on boosting his bottom line.The U.S. senator from Massachusetts appeared with Clinton before a raucous, enthusiastic crowd in Cincinnati, Ohio, targeting a battleground state in a potential preview of a Clinton-Warren campaign team. She repeatedly accused Trump of looking out for himself instead of for average Americans.""When Donald Trump says he'll make America great, he means make it even greater for rich guys just like Donald Trump,"" Warren said, standing shoulder to shoulder with a cheering Clinton.Clinton has struggled to win over some liberal backers of rival Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist U.S. senator from Vermont, since beating him for the Democratic nomination this month. She hopes the support of Warren can help her in that effort as she campaigns against Trump for the Nov. 8 election.Warren, who has vigorously attacked Trump in recent weeks, called him ""a small, insecure money grubber who fights for no one but himself"" and warned: ""He will crush you into the dirt to get whatever he wants. That's who he is.""The capacity crowd repeatedly roared its approval, and a line of supporters who could not get inside stretched out the door and down the street. At one point, Warren stopped her speech to turn and applaud Clinton, a former secretary of state.""She knows what it takes to beat a thin-skinned bully who is driven by greed and hate,"" said Warren, known for calling for reining in Wall Street and eradicating income inequality.
WARREN 'A SELLOUT' - TRUMP
In a statement, Trump called Warren ""a sellout"" for backing Clinton, who has taken donations from Wall Street interests and once backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Asian trade deal. Clinton has since reversed her trade stance.In an interview with NBC News, Trump called Warren ""a fraud"" and ""a racist,"" accusing her of making up claims about her Native American heritage to advance her career.He again called Warren ""Pocahontas,"" the name of a 17th-century Native American figure, to draw attention to a controversy first raised during Warren's 2012 Senate race in Massachusetts.""She is one of the least productive senators in the United States Senate,"" Trump told NBC. ""We call her Pocahontas for a reason.""
Two other potential Clinton vice presidential picks - U.S. senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Sherrod Brown of Ohio - rejected Trump's assertion and defended Warren's record.""That's what he does, he attacks people. He acts like he's attacking their character - he's attacking his own character when he does that,"" Brown told Reuters.""You can't believe anything Donald Trump says. Period,"" Kaine told Reuters.OHIO PIVOTAL

Taking the microphone in Ohio, Clinton said she liked Warren's aggressive approach to her Republican rival, who has sprayed rivals and critics with insults throughout his campaign.""I just love how she gets under Donald Trump's skin,"" Clinton said.Clinton's decision to campaign with Warren for the first time in Cincinnati, a city on Ohio's southwestern border with Kentucky and Indiana, underscored the swing state's vital role in the November showdown with Trump.Ohio has backed every successful presidential nominee since 1964 and no Republican has won the White House without carrying the state.    Warren's calls to rein in corporate excess could resonate with two groups Clinton must court in the election - Sanders supporters and those anxious about the economy who are drawn to Trump's promise to toss out international trade deals.Ohio's manufacturing base has taken a hit in recent economic slowdowns, and Trump has identified it as a state where his anti-free trade rhetoric could resonate with alienated blue-collar voters.Since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee, Clinton has repeatedly tried to portray businessman Trump as fundamentally unfit for the presidency. Clinton said Warren's long history of fighting for progressive economic values made her a perfect messenger for that critique.

By Ellen Wulfhorst

NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Abortion rights advocates on Monday cheered a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that struck down restrictions to abortion access in Texas, calling it a major victory for women and predicting similar laws are now endangered nationwide.The high court ruled 5-3 that a Texas law imposing strict regulations on abortion doctors and facilities put an undue burden on women exercising their right to abortion, which has been legal in the United States since 1973.Laws such as the Texas regulations are seen by critics as a backdoor way of restricting abortion access. Hardest hit are rural, poor women for whom distance and cost put abortions out of reach, they say.The Texas law required abortion doctors to have admitting privileges, a formal affiliation that can be hard to obtain, at a hospital within 30 miles (50 km), and required clinics to have costly, hospital-grade facilities such as specified corridor width, floor tiles, parking spaces and elevator size.""With today's Supreme Court ruling, I let out a big exhale,"" said Tracy Droz Tragos, director of ""Abortion: Stories Women Tell,"" to be released in August by HBO Documentary Films. ""At least for a moment, I am optimistic about the future of women in America.""Women have had their constitutional rights vindicated, said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights which represented the Texas clinics, in a statement.""The Supreme Court sent a loud and clear message that politicians cannot use deceptive means to shut down abortion clinics,"" she said.Texas claimed its law protected women's health, but critics said the regulations were medically unnecessary and intended to shut down clinics.
Writing the Supreme Court decision, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote: ""We conclude that neither of these provisions offers medical benefits sufficient to justify the burdens upon access that each imposes.""""Each places a substantial obstacle in the path of women,"" he wrote.Decrying the decision, anti-abortion groups such as the Susan B. Anthony List said Texas women will be unprotected from dangerous and unsanitary conditions.""The abortion industry cannot be trusted to regulate itself and they know it,"" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the List, which supports anti-abortion political candidates.
Making a similar argument, Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, in a statement said abortion providers ""prey on the vulnerabilities of women who are in desperate situations, placing their bottom line over the health and safety of the patients.""""And the U.S. Supreme Court, in efforts to put the so-called 'right to abortion' above everything else, just let them get away with it,"" she said.Since the restrictive law was passed in 2013, the number of abortion clinics in Texas, a state of 27 million people, dropped to 19 from 41.""Today is a great day for women,"" said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, in a statement.
""The Supreme Court has powerfully reaffirmed a woman's constitutional right to make her own decisions about her health, family, and future, no matter her zip code,"" she said.Similar laws are likely to be struck down, experts said, in states with restrictions such as requiring women to make repeated visits or requiring ultrasounds for women seeking abortions and that the images be shown to them.""We've known for a long time that the purpose of these laws is to prevent women from having abortions,"" said reproductive rights attorney Kathryn Kolbert, who argued a major abortion case before the high court in 1992.""It may not be the death blow, but it certainly makes it more difficult to put forward these types of laws with a straight face,"" she said.Documentary filmmaker Dawn Porter, who made a film about abortion providers in Texas and elsewhere in ""Trapped"" that was released this year, said she was ""elated.""""If there's any silver lining in Texas making such an egregiously unconstitutional law, it's that I think people have woken up and people are thinking you can't taking any rights for granted,"" she said. ""You cannot sleep on your rights.""

9	9	http://reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-abortion-cases-factbox-idUSKCN0ZC0JR	Factbox: Major U.S. Supreme Court abortion rights cases	"

The U.S. Supreme Court's key rulings on abortion, dating to the landmark 1973 decision that legalized the procedure nationwide, have long provoked social, religious and political tensions.As the court majority became more conservative over the decades, it set standards that enhance states' ability to regulate abortion. Yet even in the most recent rulings, extending to 2007, there have never been five votes on the nine-member court to reverse the fundamental right to abortion.Here is a look at the court's major abortion rulings.Roe v. Wade, 1973, 7-2 voteThe court rules that a woman's constitutional right to privacy protects her decision to end a pregnancy, and only a compelling state interest can justify regulating abortion. The decision institutes a three-part legal test, connected to a nine-month pregnancy and a fetus' viability, that gives states more latitude for regulation with each trimester.Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 1992, 5-4 vote
The court affirms the right to abortion. Rather than the trimester framework, the test is whether a government regulation imposes an ""undue burden"" on a woman seeking an abortion by creating a ""substantial obstacle"" to the procedure before the fetus develops to the point at which it becomes viable.Stenberg v. Carhart, 2000, 5-4 vote
The court decides that a Nebraska ban on a late-term procedure critics call ""partial birth abortion"" violates a woman's right to abortion. The procedure, known medically as ""intact dilation and extraction,"" involves a physician removing most of the fetus intact rather than dismembering it. The justices fault the Nebraska ban, similar to laws in a majority of the states at the time, for its ambiguity about precisely what type of medical procedure is prohibited and for lacking an exception for the health of the mother.Gonzales v. Carhart, 2007, 5-4 voteThe court decides that a federal Partial Birth Abortion Act, involving the same type of procedure as in the Nebraska dispute and without an exception for the woman's health, is constitutional. The majority distinguishes the ruling from the 2000 case by noting that Congress developed findings that the procedure would never be necessary for the health of the mother. Another factor in the reversed course was that in 2000, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor had voted to strike down the partial-birth ban. She was succeeded by Samuel Alito in 2006, and in 2007 he cast the fifth vote in favor of the ban.
Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, 2016, 5-3 voteThe court strikes down a Texas abortion law imposing strict regulations on doctors and facilities, finding that the 2013 statute put an undue burden on women exercising their right under the U.S. Constitution to end a pregnancy. The court declares that both provisions of the law - requiring physicians who perform abortions to have difficult-to-obtain ""admitting privileges"" at a local hospital and requiring clinics to install costly hospital-grade facilities - violate abortion rights. The ruling marked the firmest endorsement of U.S. abortion rights since the 1992 Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey ruling.
