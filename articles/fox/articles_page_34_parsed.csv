This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!INGRAHAM: In the ""Factor Follow up Segment"" tonight. Is it possible to criticize the President without someone suggesting you're a racist? A few days ago Attorney General Eric Holder implied that criticism of him and President Obama is being driven by race. Holder made the comment in front of Al Sharpton's advocacy group and the same place where President Obama gave the key note address today focusing on the Voting Rights Act while taking a shot at Republicans.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: The right to vote is threatened today in a way that it has not been since the Voting Rights Act became law nearly five decades ago. Across the country, Republicans have led efforts to pass laws making it harder, not easier, for people to vote.(END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Joining us now from New York is Rich Benjamin he's a senior fellow at Demos and the author of the book ""Searching for Whitopia: An Improbable Journey to the Heart of White America."" Ok Rich, it's great to see you.Here is what I am wondering about ok? We have the anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, obviously the President wants to commemorate that. All the former presidents did. And we take this moment to turn it into partisan attack on the Republicans who want -- some want more voter I.D., integrity at the polls.And we turn a moment which I think should be a bipartisan moment into a real partisan frame of speaking. I find that to be frankly reprehensible but it doesn't surprise me. Your response.RICH BENJAMIN, SENIOR FELLOW, ""DEMOS"": Well, Laura, democracy itself is not partisan, so it's not about attacking the Republicans. It's about protecting our democracy. Something that's very important here on the milestone of this crucial bill that you have benefited from, that I have benefited from. So that's the way the President sees it.INGRAHAM: Yes.BENJAMIN: This fundamental right to vote that we need to protect for everybody's good. And so it's democracy when you protect it is really not a partisan move.INGRAHAM: Right but this is about race here. For the President, this is about race. I mean he's speaking about this at an incredibly important race you know event that commemorates racial equality and so forth and on the heels of what Eric Holder said this week. And intimating that the reason he is being questioned about four dead Americans or IRS targeting or any of these scandals is because of the color of his skin.Now, he is the attorney general of the United States. He's supposed to enforce the law across the board without regard to party politics and instead this week he turns his position into a battering ram against the Republican Party using this sickening and cynical race card again.Again, I find that to be antithetical to what the civil rights movement was supposed to be all about -- true through opportunity. He has an opportunity. I think he is failing as attorney general. Not because he's black, but because he's doing a really lousy job. That doesn't make me a racist. Go ahead.BENJAMIN: Well, I don't think Eric Holder would agree that he's failing. So he -- A, he didn't say that he was failing and B, he didn't say he was failing because of his race. Rather, what we saw today is a civil rights group that works on behalf of all Americans gathering and the President remarking a civil rights legislation and commenting on the right to vote. And it's going to be very important because, from Wisconsin to Ohio, and all these important swing states that are going to matter, not only in 2014, but in 2016, winning the right to vote of several.(CROSSTALK)INGRAHAM: Rich, rich, this is an attempt to deflect, right? I mean your own think tank did a study about black and brown unemployment. I'm sure you are aware of the study, are you not? The crisis in black and youth -- black and brown youth unemployment, your organization commented on what's happened to young African-American and Latino males over the last several years. And it is disastrous.BENJAMIN: We are proud of that study. We are proud of the study.INGRAHAM: Right. So why are you talking about that with President Obama, why aren't you challenging him?BENJAMIN: But we have also done work building pathways to the -- building pathways to the middle class for all Americans regardless of race and so this what we've done --INGRAHAM: But what's more important today that?BENJAMIN: Pardon?INGRAHAM: It is -- don't you think that is the real crisis today? Young African-Americans and Latino males and everybody, frankly? They don't have any opportunity --BENJAMIN: Jobs is a crisis, democracy is a crisis. What the President spoke of today is a crisis when people are limited in terms of voting hours, in terms of voting times, in terms of restrictive voter IDs that's also a crisis alongside jobs.INGRAHAM: Do you think it's a hard thing to get an ID today Rich is that a hard thing to get a voter I.D.? Is that difficult?BENJAMIN: For some people it is. Not for you not for I, 25 percent of African-Americans who have abided by the law find it difficult to get voter IDs. And we've got to honor that if we are interested in them voting we have to let them vote.INGRAHAM: It's a lot harder to get a job than it is, of course, to vote -- voting is fairly easy not very difficult but that's the crisis in America. And I wish -- I wish all of you folks would focus on that.BENJAMIN: So why limit the right to vote then? Why do we need the right to vote then?INGRAHAM: Well we actually want people voting who are qualified to vote and have a proper I.D. that's not a civil rights issue. That is a logical issue. Richard, we appreciate it.And straight ahead Jeb doubles down in his controversial position on illegal aliens. A look at how that is going to play with voters in a moment.Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2012 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

2	2	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/08/12/politics-race-in-2016-campaign/	The politics of race in the 2016 campaign	"This is a RUSH transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" August 11, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!BOLLING: In the ""Impact Segment"" tonight the politics of race in the 2016 campaign.Nearly two dozen people were arrested in Ferguson, Missouri last night as protesters continued to mark the one-year anniversary of Michael Brown's death. Since Ferguson, activist groups like Black Lives Matter have begun using more extreme tactics to further their cause. But could this end up hurting the Democrats in the election?Joining us now to analyze from Los Angeles, civil rights attorney Leo Terrell; and here in New York, Fox News contributor, Deneen Borell.Mr. Terrell -- I want to start with you. This is a one-year anniversary in Ferguson a day ago -- are New York and Baltimore next? And frankly every time there is an issue -- a race issue, are we going to see these -- repeat these issues? These activists coming in and creating violence and disrupting the community?LEO TERRELL, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Well, I don't think it is violence Eric, per se. I know there's a situation in Ferguson where there's a lot of problems but Black Lives Matter is a legitimate political group now that is going to be a major player in Democratic politics because if they are going to try to keep the Obama coalition --BOLLING: On the plus side or on negative side? Mr. Terrell -- on the plus side.TERRELL: Well --BOLLING: They disrupted Bernie Sanders. They stopped Bernie Sanders in his tracks. He had to leave the stage because they disrupted that.TERRELL: And look what Bernie --BOLLING: One more issue. Martin O'Malley, a tough guy had to come out and apologize for saying ""all lives matter"".TERRELL: Well, let me give you a perfect example. Bernie Sanders's rally was upset and protested, but he look what he did. He appointed some individuals regarding the issue of race. He has been pushing economic inequality but he was not addressing black lives.And now as a result of that protest, he definitely had don an about face and addressed the issue of racial inequality in this country.BOLLING: Deneen, last night Sheriff Clarke was on the show and he said that this is nothing more than a return to the scene of the crime where the big lie ""hands up don't shoot"" started.DENEEN BORELL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Sure. And that was a big lie because it was disputed by the Department of Justice investigation and the forensic evidence. Black Lives Don't Matter is a disruptive group. One of their demands is to arrest Darren Wilson. And again --BOLLING: Black Lives Matter.BORELL: Black Lives Matter -- excuse me. And so listen what they are ignoring are the root causes that are causing the problems in black communities -- poor quality schools, high unemployment. Individuals who are seeking income elsewhere because they can't get a job. Low job creation. And these are the issues that affecting these communities.And when you have this kind of environment, of course, there's going to be more crime. We have 13 percent of black Americans and they are creating almost half of the homicide rates in the country.BOLLING: Mr. Terrell -- the numbers don't lie.TERRELL: Eric --BOLLING: Go ahead. Go ahead.TERRELL: Eric, it's disingenuous for my colleague to mention the situation in Ferguson and not to mention the situation in the University of Cincinnati; not to mention the situation in North Charleston, Carolina; not to mention the Freddie Gray case. She can point to Ferguson and she can argue that case.But what about these shootings where the prosecutor has charged police officer. Black lives matter and there are examples of cases where police have used excessive force.BOLLING: Mr. Terrell -- can I ask you this?TERRELL: Please.BOLLING: Is the phrase ""white lives matter"" -- is that offensive to you?TERRELL: No, it's not offensive to me. But to me it deflects the issue. There are African-Americans Eric, that are dying, being shot in the streets on a higher level, on a much more higher percentage level than whites. And I think what this focus group is doing is telling every Democratic candidate you have to address this issue.Because my colleague has not made any reference to Cincinnati that happened last week or the North Charleston shooting in which an African- American man was shot eight times in the back. How about a comment about that?BOLLING: Ok. Let's talk about this. The reason why we brought you two together is we see that on the Democratic side Hillary Clinton wants to talk about everything except this. Bernie Sanders, his rally got stopped in its tracks by Black Lives Matter. Are the Democrats going to be hurt by the Black Lives Matter movement?BORELL: Just to address Leo's point real quick. What about the black on black high crime rate, murder rate in Chicago and elsewhere in urban communities?To answer your question, Eric, listen. This will harm the Democrat Party, the election because listen these individuals are disruptors, they're not looking at the problems. The root problems that are happening in these communities which are really a result of failed progressive policies. They had their own agenda.Again, what they are looking at, the demands that they are bringing to the table are not going to change the dynamics in the black community.BOLLING: All right. I have to leave it there.Go ahead, quick thought. Quick thought -- last words.TERRELL: Yes. I bring up two points. One, the black on black crime. You ignore the fact that the crime here is government involvement with police. And secondly even Rand Paul, a Republican, has addressed the issue of black lives and the problems in the black community.BOLLING: Ok. All right. We'll have to leave it there.Deneen and Leo -- thank you very much.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
