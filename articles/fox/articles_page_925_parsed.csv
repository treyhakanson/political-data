1	1	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/10/30/speaker-paul-ryan-ushers-in-new-wave-leadership/	Speaker Paul Ryan ushers in a new wave of leadership	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" October 29, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SPEAKER PAUL RYAN: The house is broken. We are not solving problems. We are adding to them. And I am not interested in laying blame. We are not settling scores. We are wiping the slate clean. How reassuring it would be if we actually fixed the tax code, put patients in charge of their healthcare, grew our economy, strengthened our military, lifted people out of poverty, and paid down our debt.  (APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, 'SPECIAL REPORT' HOST: New House Speaker Paul Ryan sworn in today by the oldest member in the House, John Conyers from Michigan, who, by the way, started in Congress six years before Paul Ryan was born.We're back with the panel. Mara, he has got a full plate, but it's a little bit less of a plate thanks to John Boehner leaving.MARA LIASSON: It certainly is. John Boehner said he wanted to clean the barn and he really did. He gave a huge gift to Paul Ryan. Paul Ryan doesn't have to worry about the debt ceiling until after the next election. He doesn't have to worry about a budget. I think that was a big gift.Now, Paul Ryan is going to get a little honeymoon, we just don't know how long. He got support from the freedom caucus. But he is going to have to pass another CR. He is going to have to do --BAIER: Continuing resolution.LIASSON: Continuing resolution to keep the government open. He is going to have to do something about the highway trust fund. I mean, there are going to be contentious issues.He does say he has listened to the Freedom Caucus. They want process reforms. He is going to give them process reforms, and then we will see if he gets them all into the tent, feel like they are part of the process. Maybe things will be less dysfunctional.BAIER: George?GEORGE WILL: I think that's right. I think he is on the way. And I think although the Senate tonight is going to be fighting over this bill, in fact the conservatives got rather a lot out of the budget agreement. Entitlement reform of Social Security, disability insurance. The president wanted a clean bill. He didn't get it. Defense hawks wanted more from the military, they got it. They didn't get everything, but politics is a transactional business and this wasn't a bad transaction.BAIER: Yes. Conservatives obviously not happy about it and speaking out about it. But, as you mentioned, the Senate is moving forward with this Bill and there is nothing that is going to stop it. Whether Rand Paul stands up or Ted Cruz stands up, it's moving through.CHARLES LANE: You know, I actually don't regard that agreement as a budget bill at all. I see it as a political agreement. And the trade goes like this -- the Republicans in the Congress basically conceded to President Obama and his allies about $40 billion in domestic spending that they can use to keep all their Democratic constituencies happy. And in return the Republicans get more defense spending and a long piece where through the rest of the campaign now they are not burdened by all this rhetoric about a shutdown, and so forth.And what that leaves Paul Ryan in a position to do over here in the Hill is repair and rewrite and revise the image of the Congress and in particular the Republican Party. That's what this speech, this rather eloquent speech he gave today was all about -- drawing a line under the pass. I'm not interested in blame. Not blaming freedom caucus, not blaming the Democrats. Fresh start.And what was so fascinating about it was that litany of things he wanted to achieve was like policy objectives. Reform this, opportunity that. Very different from the note that Ted Cruz was striking, which is this more radical, more revolutionary thing. We've got to overthrow Washington. So, he is trying to set a different kind of tone, and he has been given it. By this agreement he has been given the time to attempt that.BAIER: So, Paul Ryan is a protege of Jack Kemp, the late Jack Kemp. He believes that solving poverty issues, helping the poor comes through conservative principles. He is going to try to put that into his speakership. But pushing tax reform as speaker, different than chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. And can he get the big things done?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER: I'm not sure he can get them passed with Obama in the White House. But I think his job is not to do that. His job is to shape the legislation, to shape the party to support it, and present the tax reform that would be essentially owned by the Republicans, the regulatory reform, and the entitlement reform.Here is a guy who knows his stuff. Does he have the skills of a speaker? I think he does. He could be the most talented politician in the House. And I think the most important thing that happened today, when he essentially said we are going to abolish the past. We are not going to look at it. It's over. And we're not going to examine it, the generational change.It is just striking, the youngest speaker in 150 years. Look at the stage last night for the Republicans trying to be president, a very young field, relatively speaking. Imagine one of them in the White House and Ryan in the House, the future of the GOP, which has been -- its obituary has been written 10 times in the last six months, I think could actually be extremely bright.BAIER: George, I said in that national debt piece and we stand at $18.2 trillion national debt tonight, that we're always, it seems, one election away from getting the big things done. This is going to happen this next session in a presidential election.WILL: And someday, sure as shooting, they are going to have something other than zero interest rates. That's made big government cheap by making the borrowing cheap. Once we go back to anything like the post war norm for the cost of borrowing, say five percent, the deficit itself becomes the driver of the deficit and the budget explodes. And it's not going to be within the control of Congress.BAIER: Final word?LANE: Well, obviously it's going to go back to the generational point. You have a paradox. The Republican Party has young leaders and candidates and old voters. The Democrats have old candidates and leaders and old voters.BAIER: Mara?LIASSON: Yes. That will be pretty interesting to see if those young Republican candidates if they become the nominee can get any of those young voters.KRAUTHAMMER: Reagan was able to attract young voters. You get a new and dynamic Republican Party and the young will follow.BAIER: Is the Marco Rubio youth an issue that will be tackled in this presidential campaign?KRAUTHAMMER: It will be an advantage. You run him against Hillary, it will be -- Kennedy used it. I think it's an attractive element of any candidate. The anxiety and the tiredness of the electorate today reflected in the look for outsiders, I think also will be looked for a new generation. I think it's going to help any outcome candidate.BAIER: We will follow it every step of the way. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That is it for a very special SPECIAL REPORT. Thanks for Norfolk Southern tonight for limited commercials. Keep us on our toes. Fair, balanced, and unafraid.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Why is the coffee shop getting involved in politics? This is simply PR. It's not as if there was some big event that happened at Starbucks related to a gun. This is the CEO taking advantage of the DC Navy Yard shooting inserting himself in the conversation and trying to generate a conversation about gun control. That's what it's all about: PR and politics.WAYNE ROGERS: I think they have every right to say what they say. If I owned a store I would be the same way as Howard Schultz. I would just say ""guys we don't want people coming in here with guns."" I don't want them to come in with flame throwers. I don't want people to come in with sticks of dynamite. All of that upsets my customers. I have a right to say that, why shouldn't I say that? Why he's doing it, I don't know.EBONI K. WILLIAMS: I think there's precedent for this type of CEO political statement. We saw this with Chik-Fil-A last year, coming out with this really hard, bright-line stance against marriage equality. Is it bad for business? I don't think necessarily. Chik-Fil-A really didn't see any type of significant downfall in their business. In fact, they had about a 2.2 percent sales increase after that type of political statement. And Starbucks itself has gone down this road, taking a bright-line stance in favor of marriage equality. Three weeks after that stance, their stocker percentages went up 15 percent. So I don't think it's bad for business.JONATHAN HOENIG: No one on this panel should lecture Howard Schultz on how to run business. He's done pretty well without any of our help. This is a property rights issue, Eric. It is not a Second Amendment issue, and I'm saying that as a card-carrying member of the National Rifle Association. Starbucks is a business. It's private property. They're going to make the decisions that are best for their brand and best for their bottom line. And to Schultz's credit he is asking customers not to bring guns into the store. I think Second Amendment advocates should respect his rights; should respect his property wishes and not make his stores the battleground for some kind of political movement.RED FLAGS MISSED IN NAVY YARD RAMPAGE FUELING CONTROVERSYJONATHAN HOENIG: Our defense policies are dominated by egalitarianism in this notion that everyone's the same, no one is more or less of a risk than anyone else, we have to treat everyone equally. Bologna. We should be profiling. Specifically those who we know present a bigger risk than others. So instead of patting down granny at the TSA we should pat down those associated with Islamist groups. Instead of restricting everyone's gun rights we should restrict the rights who have actually demonstrated mental illness. Or instead of snooping on everyone we should actually maybe address Jihadism and the actual enemies to this country. But indtead we treat everyone the same and that's why we miss so many of these clear and present danger threats.WAYNE ROGERS: I think, Eric, the government is too big, You know that. We've got 8 zillion agencies all falling all over themselves trying to do some kind of a job that they cannot do, they're ill-equipped to do. They snoop on each other, we know that. Here's the IRS snooping on us innocent citizens, and the people who are running the IRS don't know any better. Look at the amount of fraud, for example, that's in the disability payments: over $1.4 billion. I mean these are people who are inept, who are dumb, who are stupid-and we've got them all in the government. They just all ought to clear them out, start all over.EBONI K. WILLIAMS: I think anytime we're talking about encroaching on the citizens' privacy rights you've got to be careful. And I, above all else, am really big into protecting those rights. But back to Jonathan's point, its unreasonable searches and seizures. When you've got people on record as having documented mental illness, documented arrest records, documented criminal records that unreasonable notion goes out the window. At this point you're talking about a reasonable risk of harm that these people are posing, and that can trump these privacy rights of individuals.MICHELLE FIELDS: They're absolutely failing, I mean look at them. They are spying on innocent Americans while their colleagues, the guys who are sitting in the cubicle right next to them, are being implicated mass shootings, and being implicated for espionage, and being implicated for releasing national secrets. I mean this is what is going on in the government. I think the problem is that we have a government that is too big and has spread itself too thin. There are five million people with top secret security clearance right now. That is too many people. There is no way you can vet all of these people. There are going to be people falling throught the cracks.YOUNG AMERICANS SUFFERING HIGH RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENTMICHELLE FIELDS: A lot of these young people voted for Obama because they thought he was going to come in and fix the student loan crisis, but he hasn't done anything about that. All he's done is freeze the interest rates, and interest rates aren't the problem; it's the rising cost of tuition. If Obama wants to fix that, he needs to rethink government subsidies, because government subsidies are what are driving up the cost of tuition, and they're diminishing the return on investments for graduates because it's creating an artificial demand for college. So not only are kids not having a job-they have a ton of student loan debt and they don't know what to do. I mean there's nothing to do.EBONI K. WILLIAMS: It is inexcusable and I am not going to make excuses for the President. But I will give him credit when we talk about the student loan forgiveness legislation and the ObamaCare provision that allows young people under the age of 26 to stay on their parent's policies, those things do give some fiscal breathing room. However, what our generation is getting wrong is that we go to school and we do not know what to do when we get out because we are not learning skill sets that transfer into dollars and cents.JONATHAN HOEING: The people who are hurting are the young people specifically. This is the net result of Obama's egalitarianism, his collectivism, and his calls for self-sacrifice; it has hurt the youth more than anyone else.WAYNE ROGERS: I don't think it's just the young people and they are not being discriminated against. Everybody is being discriminated against; you got 47 percent of the people in the United States who don't pay any taxes whatsoever. It's a Keynesian economic theory; they are sacrificing ideology to undermine everything. After four and half years that this man has been in office you still have unemployment in excess.WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW?WAYNE ROGERS: WIN BIG WITH GAMING EXPANSION AND GAMING STOCKS LIKE (WYNN)JONATHAN HOENIG: (NM) UP AROUND 30 percent SINCE I PICKED IT ON AUG 10TH, STILL HEADING HIGHER"	['Schultz', 'Obama']	['guns']

8	8	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/06/16/bill-oreilly-doing-nothing/	Bill O'Reilly: Doing nothing	"By Bill O'ReillyBack in the 19th century there was an American political group known as the ""Know Nothings"" because they were secretive and pretty much ineffective. Today we have a do nothing government in Washington. Our elected officials generally sit around saying oh they will get to the bottom of it. They will get to the bottom of everything. Claiming they are working around the clock but little is actually accomplished.Let me back it up. When Putin invaded Crimea, America was caught by surprise. When terrorists killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, America was caught by surprise. When the V.A. scandal broke in Phoenix Arizona, the administration was caught by surprise. When thousands of children started illegally walking across the southern border it was a surprise in Washington.And now, with Iraq on the verge of collapse, guess what? They are surprised. But the President says they are working hard on the problem.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My team is working around the clock to identify how we can provide the most effective assistance to them. I don't rule out anything.(END VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: The critics of the President say he has known for months that Iraq was in danger.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BOEHNER: It's not like we haven't seen this problem coming for over a year. And it hasn't -- it's not like we haven't seen over the last five or six months these terrorists moving, in taking control of western Iraq. Now they have taken control of Mosul. They're a hundred miles from Baghdad. And what's the President doing? Taking a nap.(END VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: Even though that's a partisan statement, President Obama does appear disengaged from vital problems all over the world and it looks like American voters are starting to understand that. New Gallup poll asks does President Obama manage government effectively: 39 percent say yes; 60 percent say no. Then this question: does President Obama have a clear plan for solving the country's problems -- 34 percent say yes; a whopping 65 percent no. Let me put that number into perspective for you; 34 percent of Americans will approve of whatever Barack Obama does. It doesn't matter to them. They just like him and that's that. So the President is virtually getting a no confidence vote from every other person in the country. That's amazing.Now Talking Points has been very consistent over the past 18 years -- I don't care about party politics. I want problem solvers in Washington and in our state capitals. I want honest people who will think about creative solutions to vexing situations. I have nothing personally against Barack Obama. He has helped us raise a lot of money for Wounded Warriors. He has been respectful to us generally and I support some of his programs like mentoring poor children and raising the minimum wage so more people get off the dole.But there no question at this point in history that President Obama is not effectively running the country. Senator McCain was right yesterday when he said Obama needs to fire his crew. And get some experienced people to it advise him on vital issues. Again, 65 percent of American adults believe the President is not an effective problem solver. And boy, do we have problems.And that's 'The Memo.'"	['McCain', 'Obama']	[]
