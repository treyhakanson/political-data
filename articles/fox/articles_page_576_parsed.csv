This is a rush transcript from ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" November 6, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MARIA BARTIROMO, HOST: Good morning.We are in the final stretch. The Trump and the Clinton campaigns barnstorming across the country right now, making their final pitches to voters.Good morning, everyone. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Thanks for being here. This is ""Sunday Morning Futures.""Trump senior adviser Jeff Sessions and ""Fox News Sunday"" host Chris Wallace on the state of the race coming up. Now less than 48 hours until we head to the polls.Plus, where do we stand on the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's e- mails. House Benghazi Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy with me live.And new polls out this morning show just how tight this presidential race is. Fox's Chris Stirewalt and Dana Perino as here breaking down the numbers, as we look ahead right now on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""(MUSIC)BARTIROMO: Secret Service members rushing Donald Trump off the stage last night in Reno, Nevada, after reports that someone in the crowd shouted the word, ""gun"".Welcome to ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" everybody. We are beginning with the news of the moment. There was no gun that turned up.Mr. Trump took the stage again after being rushed off moments later. He told the crowd his campaign will not be stopped. He is making his final push this morning in five different states heading to Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.Senator Jeff Sessions is a Trump advisor. He joins me right now live.And, Senator, it is good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.SEN. JEFF SESSIONS, R-ALA, TRUMP ADVISER: Great, Maria. Nice to be with you.  Exciting time.BARTIROMO: I'll tell you -- he's like a machine. I mean, Trump is going to be in Florida, in North Carolina today and tomorrow, plus, Michigan, that Rust Belt of the country. How is the team feeling with just two days to go?SESSIONS: Well, they're feeling really good and he is a leader. He's inspired the whole team. He'll be doing twice the stops that Hillary Clinton will be doing in the last few days.It's been my image for a long time, my vision for him in this last week to barnstorm this country, talking directly to millions of Americans explaining that he is going to defend their interests and we've had way too much attention on big business, money interest, foreign interest, global interest instead of the people's interests. And to a large degree, that's what this election is about.BARTIROMO: Yes, there's been a lot of back and forth between the two campaigns throughout the year, but in these final few days, it feels like Trump has pivoted toward let's reveal a positive message. Let's talk about what we can do for the country.Whereas, Hillary Clinton so far has been really on that attack mode of Trump as opposed to telling people what they are actually voting for.Is that the strategy?SESSIONS: I couldn't agree more. I couldn't agree more.I mean, you ask American people what is it that she will do other than more of the same when three to one American people think we're on the wrong track. And I think the people are right about that. We have not represented this country effectively. She has no plan to get us on the right track.Donald Trump is a leader. He's a man who believes in results, not talk.  He judges himself, what he accomplishes that you can see and touch. I believe he'll be a great president.I think people are seeing that more and more, and I think his instincts on every major issue take a country in the right direction.BARTIROMO: Well, I know what he has talked about in terms of his economic plan, lower taxes, roll back regulation, tap into energy, perhaps redo trade deals that are not advantageous to America.But what are the other important messages? What's most important for him to communicate to voters with these just two days left?SESSIONS: I think he needs to continue to make clear that he's doing this for us, for the average American who goes to work every day and he understands our problems and the problems of decent people who worry about being able to buy new tires for their car, vacation for their family, fees at school.People are struggling out there. He seems to understand that despite the fact that, you know, that he's a wealthy businessman. And he has -- I think he can convey to the American people that his experience puts him in a position to turn this country around and get it growing again.BARTIROMO: And that's what people really need the confidence in, right?  Believing that, yes, maybe they're taking a risk. Maybe they're making a bet on somebody who is an outsider, not in politics, but maybe he also will do something to actually improve the situation.I want to talk about this letter that you penned along with others like Rudy Giuliani, Frank Keating, Victoria Toensing and Henry McMaster. This is a letter basically saying, look, it is time for Loretta Lynch to appoint a special counsel because this brings me to the question of the morning after. Regardless who wins, Senator, you're going to have the next day and you're going to have real issues on the table.Will Hillary Clinton be able to make important decisions when she's got these investigations overhanging? What does the morning after look like for Trump? What do you want to see in terms of this special counsel?SESSIONS: Well, you should never politicize criminal investigations or prosecutions. We should never do that.But the situation is such and the facts are such that we have an investigation going now and there's a lack of confidence, in fact, zero confidence really that the attorney general is doing anything other than delaying this investigation and not pursuing it effectively. It's been ongoing for over a year. A special prosecutor would have been the appropriate thing to do to take it out of politics and maybe would already have been completed, but the rumors we hear are that the FBI is being obstructed and delayed and blocked by the Department of Justice, Attorney General Lynch.So, I think this is a serious matter. We've just got to have integrity in our criminal justice system. Everybody deserves a fair day in court, but we need a fair investigation, too, and I'm afraid that's not happening.BARTIROMO: Well, in the letter, you and your colleagues write, look, the Department of Justice has been thwarted by top official's refusal to conduct a proper investigation of former Secretary Clinton's unsecured e- server and the pay-for-play accusations. So, if Donald Trump were to win the presidency, is he going to move to remove Loretta Lynch?SESSIONS: Well, of course, there will be a removal of the attorney general, as well in every cabinet position. Remember, Janet -- Loretta Lynch serves at the pleasure of President Obama. She doesn't have a termed office. She knows who appointed her and she knows whose pleasure she serves at.So, we need an independent person, person that's not politically connected that people in America can have confidence in them to take over this investigation and make sure it's done correctly, to bring charges if need.  Hopefully not charges. Hopefully they're not needed. But there are some serious allegations here that the American people need to know fully investigated.You know, FBI Director Comey did the right thing when he found new evidence. He had no choice but to report to the American Congress where he had under oath testified. The investigation was over. He had to correct that and say, this investigation is ongoing now. I'm sure it's significant or else he wouldn't have announced that.BARTIROMO: Right, which is the question I'm trying to get at in terms of Hillary Clinton. Should she win the presidency, what is she going to do in terms of governance? Can she govern effectively if she's got these investigations going on? Will she have to change FBI directors knowing that Jim Comey is pursuing this? Or are we going to have four years of, you can't get anything done because of these investigations and the challenge from the Republicans like naming new Supreme Court justices?SESSIONS: Well, it is a dangerous thing, no doubt. It puts a cloud over her tenure as president. What is she going to do about the attorney general? Who will she appoint? Will there be another loyalist as it appears Loretta Lynch is and Eric Holder was during his tenure? Or will it be someone that has respect of the American people who can handle a complex matter and do it right with confidence.To me, at this point, it's so off track and so badly handled that an independent counsel is the right thing, I have no doubt about that.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you this, Senator. Should Trump win the presidency, what role will you have in the administration?SESSIONS: You know, I've not talked to him about that and don't intend to.  I expect to be in the Senate unless he asks me to do something else, in which case I would consider that.But I do believe he's moving forward. He's talking to a number of people.  He has an effective transition team that's studying the issues out there, like both candidates have, and I believe he would be able to establish an administration of confidence, integrity, people of ability and judgment who can help lead this country and get it back on the right track again.BARTIROMO: And we should point out that you've done an incredible amount of work regarding immigration -- and your immigration policies and your immigration work has helped Donald Trump in terms of his own stance on keeping borders safe, et cetera.What do you think the most important policy Donald Trump needs to implement with regard to national security and immigration? What's happened in the first 100 days should he become president?SESSIONS: Well, there's no doubt that under existing law, we can make tremendous improvements in our immigration situation. I just came from the border Friday, on the Arizona border and talked to law enforcement and local people and local sheriffs. They're just utterly frustrated.This administration and Hillary Clinton is to the left of Barack Obama.  They are just decimating the lawful system, and that encourages more people to come. So if you have a president who lays out a clear agenda that we're going to end the lawlessness. Please don't come unless you come lawfully.  If you come, you're going to be apprehended and promptly.That will send a message, and the attempts to enter illegally will decline substantially.BARTIROMO: Yes.SESSIONS: It's not that hard. It can be done. It's the right thing for the American people. American people want it and they have the right to demand it.BARTIROMO: Senator, good to see you. Thanks very much. We'll be watching the developments in the next two days. Thanks so much.SESSIONS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Senator Jeff Sessions joining us there.And as the FBI continues sifting through the thousands of newly discovered emails on Anthony Weiner's laptop in search of a connection to Hillary Clinton, Representative Trey Gowdy will join me next, to talk about the latest on that investigation.Follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures. Let us know what you'd like from Trey Gowdy, next.We're looking ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures"", right now.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The FBI is still poring over newly discovered emails possibly related to Hillary Clinton's email investigation and her time as secretary of state.  So far, investigators are saying only that these are not duplicates but they are emails that they did not see during a previous probe of Clinton's private server.Representative Trey Gowdy is with me. He's a member of the House Judiciary Committee, also the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.Good to see you, sir. Thank you so much for joining us.REP. TREY GOWDY, R-S.C.: Yes, ma'am. Thank you.BARTIROMO: If these are new emails, some of these are new emails, Congressman. Isn't that right there evidence that the lawmakers were lied to? She said she had given all of the emails in. So, if the FBI is finding emails that they've never seen before, is right there we know that she lied? Perjury?GOWDY: Well, we don't know. Well, we don't know because we don't know whether these emails are work related or personal. If they're personal, then no one is entitled to read her yoga and bridesmaids dresses emails.If they're work related, yes. She testified under oath that she turned over all work-related emails. Frankly, we already know that to be false.  This would just be additional evidence that it was false.BARTIROMO: What about this idea that a special counsel, a grand jury needs to be brought in here? I mean, obviously there is now evidence or speculation, let's call it speculation, that the Justice Department has been trying to put a clamp on the FBI's work. Should an outsider be brought in to handle these deliberations?GOWDY: Yes, ma'am, and they should have a long time ago. This Department of Justice has been politicized. I say that actually with a heavy heart.  I actually like the Department of Justice, I want to believe in the Department of Justice. But it has been politicized.But, Maria, guess who picks the special prosecutor? The attorney general.  So, what I would love would be an attorney general who had the foresight and the respect for the justice system to say, you know what, we're going to have an independent woman or man. I'm going to stay out of it. I'm going to recuse myself totally. They can use a grand jury if they want to.That would restore people's trust and confidence in this investigation because the Department of Justice has lost it. Yes, there ought to be a special prosecutor, but there should have been a year ago.BARTIROMO: How are they still getting away with that, Congressman? If there should have been an outside independent person or committee looking at this doing the proper investigative work and they have not been, and the Justice Department is trying to clamp down the FBI's work and Jim Comey initially basically said no prosecutor would take on this case only to come out 11 days before the Election Day, this has been botched up because there was no independent counsel overseeing this.GOWDY: Well, it's been botched for a lot of reasons. Part is the politicization of the Department of Justice. Part frankly is just the fact pattern of having the Democrats nominate someone who is under FBI investigation.I mean, bad facts make for tough choices but the Department of Justice could have and should have used that regulation that empowers them in conflict of interest cases or when it's in the public interest, pick a special prosecutor who doesn't give a whit about politics, a woman or man who just follows the facts and works for that blindfolded woman holding a set of scales instead of having someone who meets on the tarmac with a spouse of the target of the investigation, which is what we have now.BARTIROMO: It's quite extraordinary. You know, when I think back to the extraordinary job you did when you were there and the testimony and Jim Comey was testifying, you asked him specific questions, did she release all the emails? No. Did she only use one device as she said? No.And you asked him question after question after question and you were very effective in that testimony, but at the end of the day, what can you do about it? Are you powerless here because of the politicization that has gone on?GOWDY: Well, Congress is. Quite frankly, Secretary Clinton has trouble with the truth and she's had trouble with the truth throughout most of her professional career. So, come Tuesday, the jury gets to decide what to do next. Congress cannot investigate, cannot convene a grand jury. We don't have the power to do that.So, if you're tired of the polite at this politicization of the Department of Justice and you're tired of scandal after scandal after stimulus plan for the criminal defense bar or whatever you think you're going to get with her presidency, our framers said, you know what, we're going to go in a separate direction. Congress can't fix it but the American people can on Tuesday.BARTIROMO: And we'll see if that actually impacts them to vote Trump.Let me ask you this, Congressman. Let's say Hillary Clinton wings the presidency. What's your take on how this plays out? I mean, she's got this criminal investigation, no doubt, that will follow her. Will she be a lame duck for four years? Will she be unable to do anything because she's got these investigators investigating her every move and also the Republicans will push back in terms of her Supreme Court appointees? What does the next four years look like in terms of governance if she wins?GOWDY: Well, let's get the good news out of the race first. It would be really, really good for criminal defense attorneys in Washington. They're going to make a lot of money if she wins on Tuesday, because of not just her but people around her from Sidney Blumenthal on up are going to be under investigation, whether it's the Clinton foundation, whether it's her emails, whether it's things we don't know about, it's going to be the shortest honeymoon since Elizabeth Taylor's sixth marriage, but that's -- you know, that's what people are going to vote for on Tuesday.If that's what they want, she is coming in under a cloud and she's going to pick the Department of Justice and an attorney general who are not going to be all that interested in investigating his or her boss. That will be frustrating. Congress will have to assume the role of oversight or watchdog. But we can't prosecute anyone for anything. I tell my fellow citizens, if this is what you want on Tuesday, let us know.BARTIROMO: Congressman, thank you. Thank you very much.GOWDY: Yes, ma'am.BARTIROMO: We appreciate and we'll see you soon, Trey Gowdy there. It is the final countdown.Two days America goes to the voting booth. A new president will be elected. Back in a minute with ""FOX News Sunday's"" Chris Wallace on deck.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. MIKE PENCE, R-IND., VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Our secret weapon is the American people who are saying enough is enough. I mean, I was here at a rally last night in Virginia. We had an overflow crowd that was bigger than some of the rallies that I've seen out on the campaign trail over the last several months.JOEL BENENSON, HILLAR CLINTON ADVISER: We're going into Election Day playing offense, keeping them on defense with states like Arizona that we never played in before, not in either of the Obama elections. So, we feel good. When we're on offense, we think we're in good shape. Voters are rejecting the divisive rhetoric that they've heard from Donald Trump.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And there is Indiana Governor Mike Pence along with Clinton campaign chief strategist Joel Benenson appearing on ""Fox News Sunday"" today, just two days before Election Day.Both sides now racing for the finish line, trying to sway every last voter in key battleground state, who may be still mulling over their presidential pick.Joining me right now to talk about the state of the race is Chris Wallace, anchor of ""FOX News Sunday"".Chris, good to see you.CHRIS WALLACE, ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY"" ANCHOR: Good to be here.BARTIROMO: Great interview. It's funny to see each side tell their own narrative in terms of how it's going.WALLACE: Spinning.BARTIROMO: How do you think it's going?WALLACE: It certainly has tightened. There's no question about that. I think two weeks ago, it really did seem that Hillary Clinton was going to sail to a relatively easy victory. I think the FBI announcement by James Comey has had an impact. I think Republicans coming home has had an impact.Clinton has many more paths to 270 electoral votes than he does, but if he were to -- you know, he's got to win Florida, win Ohio, win North Carolina, flip a traditionally blue Democratic state, if he can do that, he's the next president.BARTIROMO: Which is why he's going to the Rust Belt states today and tomorrow. He's going to be in Michigan. Interesting to see Hillary Clinton going to Michigan as well.WALLACE: I couldn't agree more. It's something I asked Joel Benenson about. She was there on Friday. She's there again on Monday.The most precious commodity, as you know, Maria, in the final days of the campaign is the candidate's time and the fact that she's in Michigan -- a state that, you know, for the entire campaign, until like three days ago we thought was off the board for Trump, not possible for him. The fact that she's there is interesting.BARTIROMO: It was a Democratic state, obviously Dem-leading state, but now she's pulling out the big guns. President Obama she's also got going to Michigan. It shows you she's nervous about losing that area of the country and Trump is doubling down on these Rust Belt states saying, look, you haven't done that much better in the last eight years, trust me -- appealing to their needs for jobs.WALLACE: Yes. I mean, Trump always felt that there was his message about trade, about immigration, was a natural fit in places like Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Ohio it seems to have been, he seems comfortably ahead there. Pennsylvania and Michigan are still uphill climbs, he's behind in the polls in both of those states, and he's almost - - I mean, there are different scenarios, but the easiest path to 270 for him is to take one of those states. If he flips that, he can win it.BARTIROMO: People are not sure about Pennsylvania so he can still win it.  It will be harder without Pennsylvania, but that's a big one.WALLACE: Right. If he doesn't, that's one of the reasons I think he's pushing in Michigan as a kind of plan B. But, interestingly enough, her big final campaign rally, Clinton's, is tomorrow night in Pennsylvania and it's the entire Clinton family, including former President Bill and the entire Obama family. I guess she goes on to North Carolina from there but it's interesting because two weeks ago, as I say, it looked fairly comfortable for her. And now they're both -- they're both on offense and they're both on defense. She's making an effort in places like Arizona and Georgia which are typically Republican.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a good point. They're having a big party, a pre- election party on Monday night in Pennsylvania, the whole Clinton clan.Let me ask you about this FBI investigation. Do you think it has moved the needle in terms of independents and where they're going to go, knowing now that she is under FBI investigation and they reopened it?WALLACE: Well, if you believe the Fox News poll, 21 percent of independent voters say that they are less likely to vote for Clinton because of this.  I -- it seemed to have just looking at the polls, it seemed to really have an impact in the first days after the announcement. It was a week ago Friday. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday in the polls he was either ahead or a tie. She seemed to have moved out to two or three.I mean, we're still talking inside the margin of error, but the shock value seems to be wearing off a little bit. But, of course, it does raise the possibility, she could be the president-elect on Wednesday and still under criminal investigation by the FBI.BARTIROMO: Right, which is what I was just talking to Congressman Trey Gowdy about and Jeff Sessions as well.Real quick in terms of what happens next and in terms of the GOP and their support. This morning, we see Paul Ryan coming out saying, hey, look, I'm ready to campaign with Donald Trump. Too little too late? What do you think, Chris?WALLACE: Well, in terms of the leaders, yes. In terms of the rank and file, it's important and you do see Republicans -- she always had an advantage, more Democrats supporting her, more Republicans supporting him.  That's disappearing. They're both getting pretty unified support from their own parties.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll leave it there. Chris, we'll see you later on.WALLACE: You bet.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.Be sure to tune in to ""Fox News Sunday"" today at 2:00 p.m. Eastern, right here on the ""FOX News Channel"". Chris Wallace.A brand-new poll out this morning shows one of the candidates pulling ahead. We'll talk to Dana Perino and Chris Stirewalt next, as we look ahead right now on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.A new poll to report -- a brand-new poll shows Hillary Clinton's lead has widened over Donald Trump as we close in on Election Day. Secretary Clinton is now ahead by four points according to ""The Wall Street Journal""/NBC News poll this morning. That is up from just a few days ago when other polls show the race to be slightly closer.Joining me right now is Dana Perino. She is the co-host of ""Five"", and Chris Stirewalt, the Fox News digital politics editor. Both of them co- host of ""Perino and Stirewalt: I'll Tell You What"" here on the Fox News Channel.Good to see both of you.DANA PERINO, ""THE FIVE"" CO-HOST: We love to hear how people say I'll tell you what.BARTIROMO: That's true.PERINO: You have a good version.BARTIROMO: OK, good. Congrats on your new show by the way.How do you see the race right now?PERINO: I think it is probably right where it is in terms of the national vote but the battleground states are a little bit tighter. I would defer to my pollster expert over here, but Democrats have seen -- 90 percent of Democrats say they will vote for Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump may get Republicans up to 87 percent. That's a lot better than where he was in July. Turnout is the most important thing.BARTIROMO: What do you think, Chris?CHRIS STIREWALT, FNC DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: That's 100 percent right.  The broad misunderstanding about the race in the last several weeks is that it was about James Comey. It wasn't about James Comey, it was about Republicans coming home. And by and large, the Republican Party -- they in as home and as Democrats is home, but they're home. And the Republicans in large part -- so, Donald Trump is not going to do as well among Republicans as Mitt Romney or John McCain did, but he is going to do better with Democrats in certain key groups.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's interesting, because when you saw what Paul Ryan said today, I'm ready to campaign with Donald Trump, really? It's 48 hours away from election day. So this really matters now? Or will voters who are supportive of Trump be mad at him?STIREWALT: The supporters -- the hard core supporters of Donald Trump, here we're talking about, you know, 20 percent of the broader electorate are going to hate Paul Ryan no matter what. They want him out. There is nothing that Paul Ryan is going to say or do today. He could go out there with a ""Make America Great"" hat on and sing the praises of Donald Trump to the rafters and they still would never forgive him.PERINO: But one thing that Paul Ryan is doing is he's campaigning very heavily in Wisconsin, not just for Trump but also for Ron Johnson who I think is a Senate candidate, incumbent who's been running behind all year.  But I think that could be one of the surprises Tuesday night that he holds onto the seat.BARTIROMO: Let's talk about this. These polls and what we're seeing in terms of the down ballot races are really interesting and important. You think Ron Johnson wins in Wisconsin?PERINO: I'm going out on a limb there. I like to just in case. I also maintain that former Senator Evan Bayh in Indiana will lose to Todd Young and I think that will bear out.The true tossups are certainly North Carolina with Burr, Nevada, Heck, and New Hampshire with Ayotte. What's interesting about that, those three tossups are also the states that Donald Trump really needs to win if he's got a path to 270.BARTIROMO: Right.PERINO: Two places down ballot that are helping Trump I think would be Portman and Rubio in Ohio and Florida. One of the unsung heroes of this election cycle, the National Republican Senatorial Committee. They were quiet. They had money out early for those senators and they had an early out for those senators and they had an early voting push in places like Nevada, Florida, Iowa, Ohio and Arizona, which could end up not just helping the Republicans keep the Senate, but help Donald Trump if he's going to be close in those states.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's interesting that you say that because Portman and Rubio -- well, Portman was pretty positive. He didn't go all out in terms of --PERINO: He went all out very early.BARTIROMO: Very early.PERINO: So then the Republicans were able to not have to worry about Ohio so much and they could try to figure out a way to save the Senate seats like in Nevada, North Carolina. Missouri I think is one actually where the Republicans are probably a little more worried about that one that they anticipated being.BARTIROMO: And Rubio in Florida, it's amazing to me how close Florida is between Clinton and Trump.STIREWALT: It could not be closer.BARTIROMO: It could not be closer. Do you agree with Dana, Chris, that --STIREWALT: I'd better.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: -- that a win for Rubio will help Trump?STIREWALT: Well, Rubio's ground game will help Trump by getting more likely Republican voters -- voters more likely to vote Republican at the top of the ticket will help Trump. Now, the question is how much does Trump then hurt Rubio, how much does he Portman?There is give and take. It goes both ways. In Florida, he's probably -- Rubio's probably a net harm but in Ohio, where you have a lot of older working class workers, a lot of older looking white voters, you have -- Donald Trump is going to help Rob Portman.PERINO: Well, and Donald Trump will probably help Ron Johnson in Wisconsin and will help the incumbent Roy Blunt in Missouri.STIREWALT: I don't know about that.PERINO: I'm out on a limb.STIREWALT: You're Wisconsin -- you're rooting for the Packers today probably also, too?PERINO: Are they playing the Broncos?STIREWALT: No, they're not.PERINO: I always root for the Broncos.BARTIROMO: Real quick on Kelly Ayotte. I mean, her competitor is all the way to the left, right?PERINO: Hassan.BARTIROMO: Hassan, and you've got Hillary Clinton being pushed all the way to the left by the likes of Elizabeth Warren, and Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders. If Hassan wins, what does that tell us about where Hillary Clinton is going to go?PERINO: I think this is going to be interesting. You've seen them in a big civil war for the past 18 months. That's not going to end anytime soon, but the Democrats is coming, because you'll -- let's say that Hassan wins up in New Hampshire. Guess what happens?If Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, there's a whole bunch of red state Democrats up in 2018. Hillary Clinton will be pulled in both directions because she would definitely want to try to keep the Senate. And nothing Hillary Clinton could ever do will ever be pure enough for the left.STIREWALT: Kelly Ayotte is going to probably win.PERINO: Yes, I think so.BARTIROMO: OK, we will leave it there. Great to see you both.PERINO: OK.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Great analysis as always.Let's get a look at what's coming up at the top of the hour, ""Media Buzz"".  Howie Kurtz is with us now.Howie, good morning to you.HOWARD KURTZ, HOST, ""MEDIABUZZ"": Good morning, Maria.Well, you look at the explosion of polls and punditry and pontification in these final couple days before the election, also taking a look at media bias which has permeated this campaign and the coverage of the FBI probe or probes of Hillary Clinton.

We'll get into it with our political panel. Mary Kissel from The Wall Street Journal, Ed Rollins is here.We will be right back. We're looking ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are here. Less than 48 hours to go and the candidates are crisscrossing key battleground states today in that last- minute push for voters.The Clinton campaign is holding 33 events in 11 states. Donald Trump himself holding six rallies in five important swing states.Let's bring in our panel now. Ed Rollins is a former campaign manager for the Reagan/Bush ticket in 1984. He's the chief strategist for a Trump super PAC. Julie Roginsky is here, a Democratic strategist and a FOX News contributor. And Mary Kissel with us, on the editorial board of ""The Wall Street Journal"".Good to see you, everybody. Thank you so much for joining us.Ed, two days out. How are you feeling?ED ROLLINS, FOXNEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I feel can have doesn't. I think he's really turned this thing back around the last couple of weeks with the big assist from the FBI investigating. I think at the end of the day for a campaign that didn't do anything correct in the sense of organization against a campaign that did everything, it's a dead even race.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, does he have that ground game to come and bus people to the polls?ROLLINS: He certainly can't match her ground game and he certainly can't in the get out the vote, but I think the momentum that's turned to him in the last two weeks may overcome that.BARTIROMO: There sure is.Julie?ROLLINS: The critical thing is Florida. You look at Real Clear Politics, the tossups, basically 297/241. She's ahead. Florida, she's 270.BARTIROMO: Wow. Florida's critical. Julie?JULIE ROGINSKY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Florida is critical to him. Not necessarily critical to her. There are pathways for her, multiple pathways where she can win without winning Florida. But it is critical to him.I will say it's not just about the ground game, which is very important.  You also know what I'm talking about when we talk about modeling. She knows exactly who that voter is. She knows exactly whom she needs to get to the polls. That's something Trump has not done and I think to his own detriment and something that the next Republican candidate really needs to make sure they get down before --BARTIROMO: What do you mean with modeling?ROGINSKY: With modeling, what they do is they essentially model somebody to make sure that Maria Bartiromo gets to the polls, but if your twin sister with the same exact characteristics and demographics, they send 1,200, 1,400 criteria, and you may not be that voter, they don't have to focus on your twin sister, they have to focus on you.This is very specific mathematic way of identifying your voters much more specific than polling. And that's something the Clinton campaign has done very effectively. Obama did that in 2008, 2012. The Trump campaign has not modeled and I think to its own detriment.BARTIROMO: But he's been a one-man show for a long time.MARY KISSEL, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: He has been. Trump is trying to break the mold. He's trying to get voters out to the polls through social media, flying around the country and holding rallies in airport hangers.Maria, he has to win. Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida, it looks like he's doing well in Ohio, Florida is very, very close. Pennsylvania Clinton seems to have the lead and Florida doing well. He has to turn states that Mitt Romney lost.So, he's -- you know, looking to places in the Midwest, Michigan, that went to Bernie Sanders that has the disaffected high school educated white vote out there.I think the key for him, he has to stay on message. He has to talk about ObamaCare. He has to talk about jobs. He has to talk about change. He has to keep his thumb off the Twitter button essentially.Take it away from him. Put him on a teleprompter and we'll see where the chips fall.ROLLINS: They've been doing that. One is seeing the front page of ""The New York Times"" with him holding a baby. That's the traditional old politics which hasn't done at all.And I think the drain the swamp which I thought was kind of silly thing at first. I think it's become a big issue and I think it symbolizes what people think about Washington.BARTIROMO: Right.ROLLINS: I think it's worked well.BARTIROMO: Well, this campaign and the entire election season was a lot about jobs and national security. It has become just as much about ending corruption, isn't that right?ROGINSKY: It has to some extent, look, but it's also about temperament and it's about who's fit to lead. And interesting if you look at polls that have come out over the last couple of days, that's where she's got the advantage over him. It's not enough to say, I want to drain the swamp, you have to say who's going to be draining the swamp for the next four years.BARTIROMO: Have a plan.ROGINSKY: And have a plan, I think just based on temperament alone, she's got an edge. People understand, this is going to be somebody who's going to be the commander in chief of the country.ROLLINS: She's been very shrill.ROGINSKY: Ooh, I wouldn't use that word.ROLLINS: I would use that word.ROGINSKY: OK.ROLLINS: And she has been. She's very articulate person. But I've watched a lot of these sessions and she's very, very shrill. I think to a certain extent that basically backfires.BARTIROMO: It's true.But also, there is an FBI investigation happening and what does that mean?  I've been asking this question throughout the show this morning, what does that mean for the day after, Mary? When you know -- let's say Hillary Clinton wins. What happens after that knowing that we've got this investigation hanging over her?KISSEL: It means you're going to have ongoing investigations essentially.Look, there's a reason why Donald Trump is seen as more honest and trustworthy today than Hillary Clinton. There are multiple FBI investigations. He has a lot of material to talk about here.And, by the way, it's not just about the FBI. You have reporters like John Harwood, Donna Brazile, feeding questions to the Clinton campaign. You get the sense that the whole process was rigged. And I don't say that lightly because, you know, look, our voting system works. Our electoral process itself is not rigged. When you look at how the Clintons have been packaged and sold to the American people --BARTIROMO: Yeah.KISSEL: -- they're something a terrible product here. If Donald Trump has run this campaign in a different way, he would be ahead by 20 points now.BARTIROMO: You mentioned these emails. I mean, the WikiLeaks emails, the most recent one from John Harwood from CNBC basically says to John Podesta, what should I ask Jeb Bush?KISSEL: The media has not covered itself in glory in this campaign.  That's why it's so important for Trump to continue to press the message that he has a positive mission to motivate Republicans come out. He's not even getting even 90 percent of the Republicans. He needs those Republicans to come home, while at the same time suppressing the Clinton vote by continuing to emphasize just how incredibly corrupt this family actually is.BARTIROMO: Well, in the final few days of an election, Julie, isn't it the right path to make sure you communicate to voters something to vote for, right? Instead of -- I mean, she's chosen an approach to just trash Trump.ROGINSKY: Well, it's both, right? So, you have a lot of people who may not love her but are terrified of him and I'll give you an example. You got Latino voters lining up for hours to vote in Clark County, Nevada or Broward County, Florida. The reason they're doing that is not because they're enamored with Hillary Clinton, they're doing that in reaction to Donald Trump and what he said about them in the last 15 months.BARTIROMO: Yes.ROGINSKY: And when you talk about John Harwood, John Podesta, the emails, that's not what voters really care about. I agree, the media has not covered itself in glory here whatsoever, but that's not why these voters are lining up early to vote for hours.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a fair point. Let's take a short break.And we want to ask, who has the easier path to the presidency. It could come down to some tossup states. Our panel on that as we'll look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures"". We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The path to 270 electoral votes is tight. The latest Fox News scorecard suggests that the path to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is easier for Hillary Clinton if Secretary Clinton wins states in blue considered solid Democrat states. She clinches the White House with 283 electoral votes. Mr. Trump needs to win those red states, along with a number of states that are considered a tossup.Back with our panel right now, Ed Rollins, Julie Roginsky and Mary Kissel.And, Mary, you wanted to make a point early in terms of the down ballot races as well and the impact that we're seeing. Make a connection in terms of down ballot races. What are you seeing?KISSEL: Well, this is an unusual election because voters seem to be separating in some races the Senate candidates from Donald Trump, because they don't see Donald Trump as a typical Republican. So, you see a guy like Rob Portman in Ohio, with an easy double digit what looks like sailing to victory win there. You see Marco Rubio also trying to separate himself from Donald Trump, seems to be in the lead there, although it is a close race.So, you wonder if, for instance, the Rubio get out the vote mechanism is going to help Donald Trump in Florida. But, you know, it's a close race.  And it is not just a close race up ballot, it is a close race also for control of the Senate.ROLLINS: The critical thing as the leak ten days ago people would have predicted that we would lose the Senate. I don't think anybody is predicting that anymore. I think it will be close. I think we'll win that and agree with that point.The interesting thing is that last campaign that won 49 states was the one that was run for Ronald Reagan was morning in America. This one is going to end up being nightmare in the middle of the night, and it's not a pretty -- it's R-rated all the way. It's not one that people will look back on and feel good no matter what side you're on. Someone is going to win and the other side will be bitter about it.ROGINSKY: And I think you raise an excellent point. What is so depressing, and I hate to end in this note, and what's so depressing I think it is Wednesday morning, we're going to wake up and regardless of who the winner is, the country will be just as divided. I hope if Donald Trump loses, he concedes. I don't have any confidence he'll do that.And we'll have the next month or two or three if not longer of threatened investigations from one side or the other and twill be --BARTIROMO: Well, you make a good point, because when you look at the next day or let's call it January 21st, after the inauguration, neither one of these people have a mandate. Half the country didn't want them in.ROGINSKY: Yes -- well, we'll see what the numbers are like, if they had Ed Rollins type 1984 numbers, and I can say, they have a mandate. But chances are, it's going to be a very divided election.Look, when George Bush won in a squeaker in 2000, I think a lot of Democrats said, okay, I'm not happy about the result. He's the president, let's get behind him. I hope whoever the president is, the other side will believe that. I don't think they will.KISSEL: I think this narrative of Hillary Clinton as the unifier, let's come together, it is just garbage. Trump is a dealmaker, might be ready to actually deal with Democrats and willing to do deals that Hillary Clinton might not do.And also remember that Hillary Clinton is very constrained now by the left of her party. She is running for a third term of Obama. This is not Hillary Clinton of the 1990s. You can imagine a scenario -- by the way, there are also vindictive.So, if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, she's going to go after those people who came after her for the FBI investigation. She's not going to have the political space to do deals with Republicans.BARTIROMO: I would not --ROLLINS: The worse scenario would be 269-269, which is very legitimate.BARTIROMO: Wow. We'll be right back. One thing to watch between now and the closing of the polls Tuesday night.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.One big thing to watch between now and Tuesday night, Ed Rollins?ROLLINS: Trump loses Florida, it's over.BARTIROMO: Florida is what you're watching.Julie?ROGINSKY: Souls to the polls in North Carolina, Florida, and Nevada today.BARTIROMO: Mary Kissel?KISSEL: Trump, can he stay on message? Take the thumb off of Twitter, stick to the policy message, talk about ideas.BARTIROMO: That will do it.KISSEL: Yes.BARTIROMO: Mary Kissel, Julie Roginsky, Ed Rollins, great to see you all.  Have a great Sunday, everybody. I'll see you tomorrow on Fox Business Network, 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 Eastern. Have a good day.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.HOWARD KURTZ, HOST: On our buzz meter this Sunday, the final countdown, less than two days before America picks a new president. After a wild campaign in which Donald Trump's attacks on the media and Hillary Clinton's avoidance of the media took center stage, news outlets have turned this final stretch of 2016 into a blizzard of polls, punditry and pontification and lots of maps.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, MSNBC: And as of tonight, polling indicates that there could be enough Republican voters in the battleground states to give Donald Trump the presidency.BILL KRISTOL, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: I don't know. It still looks to me like Hillary Clinton wins.JON MEACHAM, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: If he wins North Carolina, I think the whole map is blown up.SHEPARD SMITH, FOX NEWS: His path is still narrow, but weirdly, it's not as narrow as it was six minutes ago.UNIDENTIFIED MALE, CNN: Donald Trump still has a narrow path to 270 and it is really a narrow one.KARL ROVE: She wins Florida and the blue wall, she's president of the United States. Florida is the must win state for Donald Trump in order to stay alive.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They believe this America is ending, their identity is ending. And that is why Trump is going to win this election.(CROSSTALK)(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: A wall to wall prognostication, do journalists have a clue who will win on Tuesday? Was it a blunder for much of the press have written off Trump's chances just two weeks ago as the FBI probe of Hillary's e-mails is fueled by lots of leaks been as big a bombshell as the pundits predicted. And what role has media bias played in this endless election? I'm Howard Kurtz and this is ""MediaBuzz.""It's all become a blur for the media as Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton make their final sprint to the battleground states across the country and the rhetoric in this often ugly campaign has turned even harsher.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: She will get us into World War III. She will get us into World War III. I will tell you that. She's incompetent. She will get us into World War III. The arrogant political class never learns.HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I am sick and tired of the negatives, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and behavior of people who support Donald Trump.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: Joining us now to analyze the campaign coverage in these chaotic last days: Erin McPike, a political commentator and former reporter for RealClearPolitics; Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist and Joe Trippi, Fox News contributor and a Democratic strategist.Erin, a number of pundits came out two weeks ago and said this race was over, done. Hillary was going to win. Who is going to be in her cabinet? No way Trump could pull this thing off. Was that in retrospect reckless?ERIN MCPIKE, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: It was in a way because throughout the primary the media kept saying that Donald Trump couldn't win the primary and then he kept winning state after state after state and became the nominee. I guess we know that he media will never learn but maybe, just maybe, this time we know that it's always going to be a race until it's over.KURTZ: Mollie, I'm not saying Donald Trump is going to win, but given that whole history of journalists and pundits writing him off and also the avalanche of negative stuff in the press against him, he is still in convention. What does that tell us about the role of the press here?MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST SENIOR EDITOR: Again, people should be very humble when they are analyzing how things are going in this race. That humility should have been built in from how often we got things wrong during the primary. At the same time, this change of heart is actually completely legitimate.It did seem like it was unwinnable a few weeks ago. It's still an uphill climb for him. But the change is because he has gained in the polls and because Hillary Clinton had such a bad couple of weeks. So, this is not necessarily a problem, this is just reflecting the reality of the changed race.KURTZ: Your middle name is humility, Joe Trippi, but many on your side did think it was a virtual lock for Hillary but don't veteran commentators know that even without the FBI and these other stuff that races almost always tighten in the final days, presidential races.JOE TRIPPI, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think a lot of commentators said things like that or prefaced (ph) it with hey, anything can change.KURTZ: The more cautious ones did.TRIPPI: Yeah, but I think the media was over -- always goes overboard in these things and never -- look, they always get closer at the end...KURTZ: Right.TRIPPI: ...they always do, and so...KURTZ: But why is that? Because you want to appear so smart that you called it a day before someone else and then you hope if you're wrong, everybody loses in the video?TRIPPI: Well, first of all if you're wrong, no one -- generally everybody is wrong. When it's going the way it was -- when it was going the way it was pre-Comey letter where everybody was sure it was going to happen, it was like little danger in doing it.KURTZ: And you set up my next question. Looking back, did the media overestimate the impact of James Comey sending that letter to the hill, opening an inquiry into Hillary Clinton's e-mails, Anthony Weiner's laptop and all that, because it was covered wall to wall as if it was the biggest bombshell of all time.MCPIKE: It was a big bombshell and we talked about this last weekend. It needed to be covered in a big way...KURTZ: I agree with that.MCPIKE: ...that weekend when it broke. But I think the coverage has sort of evened out as we've gone on in the last nine days or so. It deserved to be covered because it was a huge story, and the FBI's involvement in this election is something that the media couldn't possibly ignore.KURTZ: Well, over the next few days after the weekend that that story just kind of took over this campaign, Mollie, there was an intense media focus on Comey, the FBI director, and whether he was meddling in the election. A ""New York Times"" news story even compared him to J. Edgar Hoover. So that shifted the focus in my view. What do you think?HEMINGWAY: Shameful the way the media covered this. There was no daylight between the Clinton campaign's approach to what happened in the FBI letter and what you were reading in many media outlets. This is a story that should have been covered on the substance. You have an FBI investigation, into one of the candidates who is running for president.That is just legitimate on its own. How it affects the race should not be the primary concern of the media covering this race, and it is a big reason why people have such a difficulty trusting their media to cover things.KURTZ: Are you suggesting that media follow the Clinton campaign line or just somehow came to the same conclusion as people in the Clinton campaign.HEMINGWAY: You can see it just by the way that the media covered things differently when the FBI let her get away with the mishandling of classified information in July, a lot of Republicans were upset of that. You saw the media coverage saying that this was so awful that you would question an FBI investigation. All of a sudden, when this changes, they also change. So again, it's following the Clinton campaign instead of doing real journalism.TRIPPI: You can't take this out of the politics of it. I mean, it's got to get covered and there were politics and the other thing that was going on was the Republicans -- I mean, both sides for partisan purposes piled on and the press -- the press initially covered what Chaffetz and some of other Republicans were -- and Trump were saying, and that immediately politicized it.HEMINGWAY: Well, what they said was that there was a reopening of an investigation, obviously true, and immediately you had the media changing the headlines on their stories in response to Clinton campaign complaints. And it was the silliest, most ludicrous thing to say that this is not a reopening of the investigation.TRIPPI: And finally Trump is screaming and it's a criminal investigation and that she's going to jail and if he was president...KURTZ: Well, there is...TRIPPI: ...they're going to cover that.KURTZ: There is a legitimate question of whether or not the hundreds of thousands of e-mails that were found on Weiner's laptop could turn out to be incredibly incriminating for Hillary Clinton or nothing. We don't know, and that's time this exploded -- the FBI didn't know because they weren't allowed to read the e-mails.But at the same time, Hillary Clinton started to -- and her people started attacking James Comey personally, and Mollie's right, that this (ph) sort of become the media narrative to some degree or would you challenge that?TRIPPI: No. I think what happened was it was politicized. The Republicans - - I mean I'm not...KURTZ: You're saying both sides.TRIPPI: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Both sides politicized it. The Republicans did and the Democrats -- that's what I mean. Once this all starts happening...HEMINGWAY: But the media should not -- the media should not take part in that politicization process.TRIPPI: But they have to...HEMINGWAY: They should just cover things down the middle of the road. And we have a lot of questions that we need answered about the investigation into Hillary Clinton, into the Foundation and instead we're wasting all this time talking about James Comey instead of the actual investigation.TRIPPI: Because there's an election for president going on in both sides and you know, one side is trying to use this to further its cause and the Democrats are going to push against that. If that means questioning why Comey did it and why he did it at that time, they're going to do that. Then the press has to report all this.KURTZ: Let me get back to the road to 270 electoral votes. Let me put up a frame grab as we call it, of CNN the other day, breaking news banner -- have we got that? There was a breaking news, look at this -- there, we dropped the banner, ""Clinton Drops Below 270 in CNN Electoral Map."" The only breaking news there was that CNN analyst had adjusted a couple of states in their count by their projection.Clinton was no longer a lock for 270. Remember these are all projections based on analysts. An interesting exchange on MSNBC between anchor Brian Williams and analyst Marc Halperin over the path to 270 which Williams kind of gave Halperin a hard time. Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRIAN WILLIAMS, MSNBC CHIEF ANCHOR AND MANAGING EDITOR: I think you've gone out of your way to find the path, argue for the path, forge the path for him in an argumentative way with your co-host to the nomination tonight. I thought you were interestingly optimistic. Where are you getting the path of positivity laid out on your broadcast?MARK HALPERIN, BLOOMBERG POLITICS CO-MANAGING EDITOR: Well it's not a question of optimism, it's basically looking at the data.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: It's getting rough out there.MCPIKE: That was surprising. Now, the CNN breaking news banner, I mean, we haven't actually had election day yet...KURTZ: That's right.MCPIKE: ...that was kind of an interesting strange (inaudible). Now, I will say, as you know, to fully disclose my bias, I love playing with the Electoral College map. It's really fun. But put in context, I want to read you a couple of sentences on the front page of the ""Washington Post"" this morning, ""The U.S. presidential election has become an object lesson in everything that ails a country, long seen as a beacon of freedom and hope.""In the second top story of the post its, ""On the eve of the election, America is afraid."" Put in perspective, talking about the electoral map is not quite that bad. You want to take an antidepressant after reading this.KURTZ: I see. You're suggesting that press has a dim view of this. I wonder how much of that is suddenly really about Trump. But Joe, look, as everybody in the press now obsesses on every new tracking poll in states like Arizona and Colorado and North Carolina and Florida and all that and Donald Trump going to Michigan and maybe he thinks that his campaign does believe they can put down play and now even Hillary Clinton going back there and President Obama going there tomorrow. It still seems like a crap shoot.TRIPPI: Well look, you can't cover this election without the map. I mean, this is a national election.KURTZ: Right.TRIPPI: I mean, no one cares -- everybody knows how California is going to vote and how Idaho is going to vote. So the whole -- everything, the campaigns, where they're going, where they're putting ads up...KURTZ: Yes.TRIPPI: ...everything is all useful information. It's all about...KURTZ: But...HEMINGWAY: Having said that, horse race coverage can kind of overwhelm the actual substance of the campaign. This has actually been an interesting campaign with candidates who have different ideas about foreign policy, immigration, economic policy -- when you obsess over horse race politics at the expense of those issues, it kind of teaches people not to vote on issues so much as to vote strategically.MCPIKE: Well, let me just say that back in 2008, the night before the election, David Gergen who was a CNN commentator went on CNN and said I expect Barack Obama to get at least 332, maybe 339 electoral votes. He went on to get 365 electoral votes.I remember watching that coverage and being surprised that someone would go on TV and say what would happen the next day. Now we do it all the time so it doesn't shock me at all, but it did back then but we changed so much, that's what we do.KURTZ: All right. Got to get a break.TRIPPI: OK.KURTZ: All of a sudden, next segment. Remember to e-mail us, mediabuzz@foxnews.com. Ask questions or comment about the media. When we come back, Donald Trump calls out an NBC reporter at the rally and the network pushes back. And later, the coverage of FBI's Clinton e-mail investigation and a related inquiry. Is the press making James Comey the bad guy?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Donald Trump has been much more disciplined on the stump in the last 10 days. But at one rally, he couldn't resist calling out NBC's Katy Tur.(END VIDEO CLIPS)TRUMP: There is something happening, they're not reporting it. Katy, you're not reporting it, Katy. But there is something happening, Katy. There is something happening.KATY TUR, NBC REPORTER: It is a unique experience to have an entire crowd of people, whether it is an open air venue like we were today or a stadium with ten plus thousand people booing you. It is especially unique when they're actually saying your name and looking directly at you. This is a shtick he does. It is to rile up his base.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: It was relatively mild, but it was a departure from Trump's scripted approach and he does have a history of calling out Katy Tur, in his words of fair and right reporting.HEMINGWAY: Yeah. There is a social contract in play and the way we treat each other is part of that contract. The media have done a lot to hurt that social contract. In recent years, you know, destroying the life of a low level Capitol Hill staffer because she had the audacity to criticize the Obama family, publishing the addresses of gun owners, hounding pizza shop owners because they have the wrong religious views and UVA -- we just saw what happened where they tried to destroy an entire institution, a fraternity and administrators.When people break that social contract, you do expect to see people start to boo back. And the sensitivity and defensiveness that we're seeing among media people when they have done so much to destroy civil discourse and to disparage the views of so many people, I'm not that impressed that we're getting that upset by it.KURTZ: Erin, Katy Tur has written of being shouted at by crowds, of once having to be escorted out by his Secret Service. Would you think the media are being overly sensitive as Mollie suggest to when Trump singles out journalists by name and the crowd kind of turns on them?MCPIKE: I don't. I think she's within her rights to talk about how this affects her personally because she is just doing her job, and she's doing a pretty good job at that, a very good job because she's never covered politics before. I think this is a more complex story than that though because she is the first reporter from a major news organization to be assigned to Donald Trump as she was in June of 2015.She's been there from the very beginning as MSNBC says frequently before her live shots. And I think Donald Trump probably feels that he should get more positive coverage from her and that's what he expects. But I think she's doing her job pretty well.KURTZ: Well, Donald Trump feels he should get more positive coverage from a lot of news...MCPIKE: I agree. That's true.KURTZ: Well, many of which he banned from covering his rallies for months and months. Let me get your...MCPIKE: He gives her a lot of access.TRIPPI: I think it's all the press' fault and Trump had nothing to do with it. Yeah, I mean, when he calls them out like that. I mean, it's -- yeah, he has a right to do that and the reporters can push back particularly when he's literally seeking his crowd on them, which he has a tendency to have done in the past.KURTZ: Well just to clarify, (inaudible) seeking his crowd on, you're not saying that he's suggesting that anything physical?TRIPPI: Oh, no, not...HEMINGWAY: The media have lower approval ratings than both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and there is so little self-reflection on why that is and what we should be doing to improve our reputation.KURTZ: Not big on self-reflection (ph), I agree. Let me get to Melania Trump, she gave a speech in Pennsylvania in which she said this about the web, our culture has gotten too mean and too rough especially to children and teenagers. And the media reaction was sort of along the lines of CNN's Dana Bash -- have you met Donald Trump? Maybe you should talk to your husband about the examples he set.""HEMINGWAY: Well, it's a very fair criticism since the person we know who's bad behavior on social media than anybody is Donald Trump. But at the same time it's interesting to see how the media kind of engage in their own bullying of Melania Trump or making fun of her language skill or what not and also how they have a different standard for her relationship to her spouse or Donald Trump's relationship to his spouse than we do for Hillary Clinton to her spouse. We're supposed to create this huge wall between Bill and Hillary Clinton that we don't see applied to the Trumps but...KURTZ: Obviously Bill, a former president. Overall, had the media been fair to Melania Trump who doesn't really seek the spotlight and this is the first speech she's given since the convention.MCPIKE: I think a number of the stories on her has been fair and I think the campaign knows that, her working illegally in the U.S. I think where she's gotten short shrift is that she hasn't gotten some of the warmer fuzzier coverage that spouses of candidates often get. You might remember in 2012, Chris Wallace went to Ann and Mitt Romney's home and she was making pancakes. Melania Trump doesn't really get those stories but campaign hasn't put her out there in that way but she's gotten some short shrift there.KURTZ: She's an asset to the campaign. There was some snarky coverage earlier on about her life as a model and all of that. But since the ""Access Hollywood"" tape and the accusations against Donald Trump, she's mainly stayed away from TV interviews, probably not wanting to have to deal with that sort of thing.TRIPPI: Well, also I think the press has been unfair to her. I think it -- she is not a politician. She's never been out there before. This is very tough thing for a family member to do. And so when she goes out there and like they give her a bad speech they wrote, or they have her talking about something, I mean, the press should put more focus on bad staffing and sort of mismanagement.KURTZ: You can tell that Trippi has been in a lot of campaigns because he has empathy for people who are -- or civilians as we call them. Joe Trippi, Mollie Hemingway, Erin McPike, good to see you this Sunday.Ahead, we'll hear from Fox News correspondents who spent months following Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and what that has been like.And up next, CNN conducts an internal investigation of Donna Brazile leaking questions to the Clinton camp but won't make it public.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: CNN cut ties with Donna Brazile for leaking the network's questions to the Clinton campaign. This is an ethical outrage in which no one looks good. Donna, now the acting DNC chair is a nice person, but she was not straight with me when she vehemently denied leaking any questions before a CNN town hall with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders last March. As we reported after the first WikiLeaks disclosure, Brazile, a CNN contributor at the time, told the Clinton team in an e-mail that she sometimes gets the questions in advance.She said one person would ask about gun control and forwarded some statistics on guns that's exactly how the question was set up by Roland Martin of TV One, CNN's partner on the town hall. CNN insisted it hadn't given her any questions and pointed the finger at Roland Martin who has said he doesn't believe he consulted Brazile in advance. CNN's criticism was mostly just aimed at its partner TV One.This week the other shoe dropped. In another e-mail to Clinton aides, Brazile wrote, ""One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash. Her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the people of Flint."" And this is how it went down at the Flint town hall.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LEE-ANNE WALTERS, FLINT RESIDENT: After my family, the city of Flint and the children in D.C. were poisoned by lead, will you make a personal promise to me right now that, as president, in your first 100 days in office, you will make it a requirement that all public water systems must remove all lead service lines throughout the entire United States?CLINTON: Well, I agree completely. I want to go further, though.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Now, after word leaked that CNN president Jeff Zucker had ordered an internal investigation, my sources say the following -- that Donna Brazile didn't talk to Lee-Anne Walters, the woman you just saw, but another Flint woman who also had a rash and then hoped to ask a questions -- this while Brazile and other CNN folks were handing out bottled water in Flint. But Zucker fired Brazile nearly three weeks ago even thought this was announced as accepting her resignation.But remember, they had no public announcement until the latest WikiLeaks embarrassment. And finally, that the probe found no one at CNN did anything wrong. Here's the problem. Zucker hasn't addressed this publicly even though word leaked to the Huffington Post that he told his staff on a conference call that Brazile's actions were disgusting. CNN has limited itself to a terse statement saying it was uncomfortable with what Brazile did.Now Zucker is a media savvy guy, he should know that just leaking word of an internal probe won't convince anyone. Imagine CNN's reaction if a presidential candidate did that. Part of the problem was keeping Brazile on the payroll while she was the DNC's vice chair. All the networks employ Democratic and Republican strategists who spin for their candidates but it's something else to engage in outright cheating, and CNN needs to address disdain that Donna Brazile left on its reputation.Ahead on ""MediaBuzz,"" Trish Regan explores whether media bias has twisted the coverage of this campaign. But first, John Roberts and Jennifer Griffin with the behind the scenes look at following Trump and Clinton.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Time now to talk to two correspondents who went out there covering the presidential nominees for a long time. John Roberts has been traveling with the Trump campaign and he joins us now from Sioux City, Iowa. John, is it harder to cover a tiny campaign team where unlike in a traditional campaign you don't have top press people going out to dinner with reporters and that sort of thing?JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS: Well, I think Howie, for us the most difficult part of this is that we haven't been able to ride a campaign plane as we have in so many other campaigns in the past, whether it was Romney or whether it was Bush in 2004 or Gore in 2000. We're flying commercial between the stops.We're almost kind of leaping ahead here and he's not taking press on the plane with him so you miss those intimate moments where the candidate comes back to the back of the plane and talks to the press and you interact with people from the campaign on a regular basis. Clearly, we see people from the campaign from time to time, but it's not that same sense of intimacy that I've experienced in previous campaigns, which makes it a little bit more difficult. You spend more time on the phone making sure you keep up the contacts.KURTZ: Yeah, and not to mention the challenge of getting to all these places by commercial flight. Has Donald Trump ever gotten upset with something you've reported and you've been maybe frozen out for a few days?ROBERTS: You know, not this campaign cycle. I remember in 2012 when I was interviewing him in Las Vegas when he was about to endorse Mitt Romney, I said something to the fact that the endorsement would happen at his hotel, which doesn't have a casino and he's on the Las Vegas strip. When I met him to interview him later that day he said, you said something not nice about me. And I said, hey, I thought you were a big enough guy that you had a thick enough skin that he could, you know, talk about what the real situation is. You don't have a casino. You're not on the strip.Well, I didn't like it very much. Funny thing with Trump is, is that if you're a little critical of him, he tries to win you over, whereas if you're very fair and balanced with him all the time and don't say anything particularly critical of him, he kind of ignores you. So if you want to get his attention, say something about him that he doesn't like.KURTZ: And then you'll get courted. You've been on the trail...ROBERTS: Exactly.KURTZ: ...with all these rallies where he often rails against the disgustingly dishonest press, calling journalists scum, calling some of your colleagues out by name. Is that disturbing to watch?ROBERTS: You know, to some degree, clearly with Fox News, almost everybody who comes to these rallies appreciates the fact that we try to be fair and balanced in our coverage. We had a couple of people yesterday who didn't like us a whole lot but by and large, people -- these are Fox News viewers who come to these events. But to see the way that he plays off the media and uses the media as a foil, to some degree can get disturbing when the crowd turns on the media.I mean the other day in Miami, I saw him calling out one of my colleagues and he was winking at her as he was doing it so, he's just playing the game. But I think sometimes people in the audience take it a little bit more seriously. People are flipping off the media. They're yelling at them. You know, you might hear somebody say tell the truth, which is fine. But when they start to get a little nasty and almost -- I want to say borderline mean, it does get a little disturbing because you wonder what might happen.I remember one event, and don't ask me what city it was in Howie, whereas the press came in off the charter, they were booed by 15,000 people in the audience. And I mean, that goes to show the fact that what he's said about the media over the course of these weeks really is having an effect.KURTZ: Right. Yeah, media not too popular these days especially among Trump supporters so I was wondering how it felt to be experiencing week after week. John Roberts, great to see you. Tough campaign for you and a lot of...ROBERTS: Good to talk to you. Thanks.KURTZ: ...a lot of frequent flier miles. Meanwhile, Chelsea Clinton and Joe Biden are on the campaign trail right about now. They're about to speak at events in Chester and Scranton, Pennsylvania. A key battleground state where the polls have really tightened. I spoke earlier, with Jennifer Griffin, who covers the Clinton campaign from Cleveland.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Jennifer Griffin, welcome.JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS: Hi, Howie.KURTZ: For months you covered Hillary Clinton during that period when you had very little access to the candidate. She wasn't holding news conferences. How did that feel in terms of you trying to cover her?GRIFFIN: Well, it doesn't feel that much different from today. We don't have much access to her today, even though we are on the plane with her. We haven't seen her on the plane, she's not come back to talk to us since the FBI e-mail story broke so it feels very much like when we started over the summer when she was in a very tough race against Bernie Sanders before the convention, before she crossed the finish line and got the nomination. We're kind of back to the future with that one.KURTZ: Right. So that brief period of availability is now history. Now, you told ""People"" magazine that the WikiLeaks e-mails have really shown that there was a disdain in the Clinton camp to the press. Have you felt that personally?GRIFFIN: Well, I can't say personally and I don't think it's any different towards me or Fox News as to the rest of the press. I think what you're dealing with is a candidate who has been in the public eye for 30 years. They've been in the white house before. She's been Secretary Of State before and she -- ever since the e-mail controversy started shortly after she launched her election, she has been in kind of a bunker mode and her campaign has been in bunker mode.And so, it's really just the way that they treat all of the press and I think that it's going to be a very different White House if she wins in terms of very difficult to cover. In fact, I mean I would compare the way it's been even with her aides in the last week since the FBI director's announcement used to be. At least they would come back -- her spokesman would come back and talk to us. Now, they just sort of dip their big toe in and then retreat like a turtle or they'll come back and everything is off the record. I mean it's very difficult to get on the record statements.KURTZ: Right, so it's a bit of a stone wall it sounds like in these final days. Do you think this whole attitude is related to the scars of the last 25 years as they see it, media's treatment of Hillary Clinton going back to the days when she was first lady?GRIFFIN: Absolutely. I've even heard that some of her aides say even when she thinks she's sitting down with people she's known a long time, people she might consider friendly press, she always feels like she gets a ""gotcha"" question or somebody goes back to something that she doesn't really want to talk about.And so -- but what's surprising to me is Hillary Clinton has been around a long time, and as you've seen her on the debate stage, she can answer any question. There's no question that we the press can throw at her that's really going to stump her. So, I do find this reticence to talk to us somewhat surprising given the fact that she can handle herself for 90 minutes on a stage with tough questions in a debate format.KURTZ: Yeah, she's perfectly capable handling those (ph) but she just doesn't like to do it if she can avoid it. Jennifer Griffin, great to see you.GRIFFIN: Thank you.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: And coming up, has the press been as unfair to Donald Trump as he says? Trish Regan will be here on that. And later, Ed Henry on the coverage of the FBI and the Clinton campaign.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: As this crazy campaign draws to a close, Donald Trump ratcheting up his criticism about the media favoring Hillary Clinton's campaign. And joining us now from New York is Trish Regan, host of ""The Intel Report"" which airs weekdays at 2:00 eastern on Fox Business.So Trish, I'm going to hold up a couple of New York magazines, Trump, loser -- big close up of his face and the front page of The New York Times, here a glowing picture of Hillary Clinton with Beyonce and Jay Z. Thoughts on that?TRISH REGAN, FBN HOST: Well, first of all, don't get me started on Jay Z because you want to talk about someone who is demeaning to women, that is Jay Z. If you go and look at any of those lyrics and we did this week on the ""Intel Report,"" and you know, look, I can't even repeat them. I wouldn't even dare repeat them on the air. They are so horrible.And he's a misogynist in terms of what he's saying there and it's horrible to think that he has had such a successful career promoting this kind of hostility to women and then the idea that Hillary Clinton's touting him as someone, you know, who is one of her big supporters?I mean to me, there's a double standard there in that, you know, this is a guy who writes horrifically about women, using many, many demeaning words. Of course, everybody is concerned about Donald Trump's words and granted he is the one running for president, but to stand up there with the likes of Jay Z and say that you're for women, I don't get it.KURTZ: Now, Trump of course has complained and I've talked about a lot of the coverage of him being in balance in the sense that he gets a lot of media scrutiny far less for Hillary Clinton, and some of it's, you know, absolutely legitimate. Trump Foundation, his business records, charitable contributions, the statements, but has there been in your view any comparable or I should say not that Clinton hasn't been covered but a comparable level of scrutiny of the Democratic nominee?REGAN: Well, I think that the media is incentivized to go after him much harder than they're going after her. We've seen evidence of this, for example even in the WikiLeaks documents that have been released that there is a cozy relationship, if you would, between many members of the media and the Clinton campaign. And so they, for whatever reason, and perhaps it's because of their own political bias, they are out to get Donald Trump in a way that they just aren't for Hillary Clinton.And so, yes, we're covering the WikiLeaks releases. We're covering the concerns about pay to play, whether or not that exists, but they certainly have come forward with a lot of evidence that suggests there is some impropriety there. We're covering that, but most of the media is reluctant to do so, Howie. They would much rather go after Donald Trump.KURTZ: I think the people get that. There's a USA Today poll by nearly 10 to 1, people think that -- people surveyed think that the media want Hillary Clinton to win and that's also true of three-quarters of Clinton supporters. But let me ask you about something that jumped out of me. New York Times liberal (ph) columnist Charles Blow writing about Donald Trump and saying, ""with my last breath, America, are you blanking (ph) kidding? I cannot wrap my head around how others with level heads and sound minds can even consider Trump for president of this country."" And to me, that's insulting to the people who -- those people who support Donald Trump when somebody says, oh, I can't even see or anybody can even consider the guy.REGAN: Well, you know, Charles is living in a bubble where he just doesn't get out much, I guess. Because if you go anywhere in this country outside of some of the big metropolitan areas, what you see is that people are really hurting. They're hurting economically. They have lost their jobs. They have lost their jobs to places like China and Mexico and so that is why this message is resonating.They don't like big political establishment types telling them what they should do. And frankly, this is a problem that political parties have had on both sides, right? I mean, you think about Mitt Romney and what he represented and how out of touch he was with the middle class in America. You now look at Hillary Clinton, she's out of touch.Suddenly, you got a billionaire who's worth more than any of them and he seems to be relating more to the middle class in a way that regardless of what happens, the conservative party and the liberals as well, they need to embrace that more because people are feeling it.KURTZ: I got just a few seconds, do you think it is fair to say that much of the mainstream media are out of touch with or insufficiently sensitive to the concerns of these millions of people, many of them working class who think the system is broken?REGAN: Yeah, of course. Because mainstream media I mean, you know, people are highly educated. They're living in affluent areas. They have no idea what it's like to be living on a paycheck to paycheck basis and you're worried about your factory shutting down because of the completion coming from overseas. Go to any little small town in upstate New York and you see how devastated they are, Howie.KURTZ: Right.REGAN: And they're just, you know, just a fraction of what they once were.KURTZ: Great to see you.REGAN: That's the feeling out there in the country and the media doesn't get it.KURTZ: Trish Regan, thanks so much. Good to see you. Meanwhile, both candidates are not doing TV interviews anymore as a matter of strategy. Hillary Clinton hasn't made once, a national TV interview since September 12th. After the break, we look at the leaks and counter leaks at FBI and Justice over the Hillary Clinton investigation. Ed Henry is on deck.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: It is the final days of the 2016 campaign. The media have been awash in leaks about James Comey launching new FBI inquiries into Hillary Clinton. Joining us now to look at the coverage, Ed Henry, Fox News chief national correspondent. So, Brett Baier and Fox reported based on sources that a separate FBI probe of the Clinton Foundation has been going on for more than a year.It's very high priority, many interviews being aggressively pursued. NBC's Pete Williams says, ""few want to call an investigation. That's a term of art at the FBI. It was initial inquiry opened a couple of months ago based largely on media reports and the book, ""Clinton Cash."" So, is this becoming a battle of leaks?ED HENRY, FOX NEWS: It is a battle of leaks, and we can get to the substance of the allegations in a minute. But first, I spoke to a senior FBI source who said Bret and others were right, that there was this big meeting at the beginning of this year. FBI and the Obama Justice Department, where some of these FBI agents presented serious allegations against the Clinton Foundation -- wrongdoing, financial issues -- and they got pushback. Not just from the Obama Justice Department. Some people assume that's just politics.They don't want to come out in an election year. But I'm told some of the FBI superiors as well said, wait a second, it's not quite there. And by the way, that's not that unusual. This happens with FBI investigations on any number of issues. Agents present evidence, they present facts, they present hearsay, they present everything. And then people above them have to make decisions. By the way, Howie, that's what we do in newsrooms as well. You say I want that story on the front page tomorrow.KURTZ: Yeah, I'm your editor and I say, Ed, you haven't got it. Go back and do more reporting. That's not unusual in (inaudible) investigation. What is unusual is the way in which this has all leaked out because this stuff is usually so closely held. I want to come back to that but let me mention that Bret Baier clarified his report on Friday saying his sources although (ph) not certain if Hillary Clinton's server, the personal server, was hacked by you know, foreign intelligence agents.And he addressed a subsequent interview after his report in which he had said, yes -- well, he's asked about whether the investigations would continue after the election -- he said, yes, our sources said it would, that they would continue to likely an indictment. That was a mistake Bret Baier said, that he was sorry. He shouldn't have said they'll continue to build their case, and that was the right thing to do to clarify it.But on this question of it's all playing out in public, I mean the Wall Street Journal was the first to get at this, Ed, saying that FBI agents were pursuing this. They were kind of hot on this story, but senior Justice Department and FBI officials didn't think they had much evidence, and they asked the agents to stand down but some of them kept going. So it sounds like somewhere between an important investigation that is being pooh-poohed or some rogue agents that don't want to give up.HENRY: Here's what I took away from the report on the Wall Street Journal and to focus on what Bret got right, which is that there's not just one investigation, there's a second track here. Everyone assumed, look, this was just an investigation of classified information. And by the way, let's not forget Hillary Clinton lied about that in March of 2015. She said there's no classified information on the server.Proven again and again it's not true. She wasn't indicted over that but she told a lie. Second track now that Bret was reporting on is that the FBI has been looking at the Clinton Foundation. And as I have been investigating this whole WikiLeaks situation over the last couple of weeks, is there a quid pro quo?We're not sure, but there is an awful lot of quid here -- $12 million that we first broke on Bret's show from the King of Morocco going into the Clinton Foundation. Do you think they didn't want anything on the Clinton State Department? Do you think they won't seek favors from a potential president Clinton?KURTZ: For $12 million?HENRY: $12 million, that's kind of a lot of money. So this is fruitful stuff to investigate. And by the way Anthony Weiner's laptop which goes back to the first track on was there classified information or not, and secondly, Huma Abedin was being paid by the state department and the Clinton Foundation.So that laptop, by the way, Howie, might have information that these FBI agents Bret was talking about might be kind of interested in, in terms of whether -- I'm not saying there was -- was there a nexus with these donors giving millions to the Foundation who might have got something from the Clinton State Department. That's a big question.KURTZ: I mean the lead of Bret Baier's story was that there was an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation and Fox stands by that.HENRY: Absolutely.KURTZ: There is now this debate about, well, is it an investigation? Is it an inquiry? How far has it gotten? And Rudy Giuliani took some heat because he indicated in one Fox interview that he knew about the Comey letter -- this is on the other investigation when it's been publicly (inaudible) on the e-mails in advance and then he kind of backtracked to say, well, he'd only talked to former FBI agents who obviously maybe a conduit (ph) to current FBI agents.I used to cover the Justice Department. This is extraordinarily hard stuff to get, and as a reporter you always like getting the inside scoop, but at the same time, law enforcement people are not supposed to be talking to reporters about ongoing criminal probes.HENRY: And so why are these leaks coming? Is there politics involved? I mean look, Rudy Giuliani shouldn't have gotten a heads up on that.(CROSSTALK)HENRY: ...at the end of the day, that's a distraction and doesn't get to the main point of what Bret is getting at and the Wall Street Journal is getting at, which is that let's follow the facts, and that's something for Hillary Clinton. The major point of all of this that's come out in the last few days is that the FBI probe of Hillary Clinton is not over. Win or lose, she's going to have big questions coming, especially if she wins. She's going to be dealing with James Comey as her FBI director. This is somebody who was nominated by President Clinton. As you know, they have 10-year terms.KURTZ: Yeah.HENRY: So whether it's Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, James Comey is still there. This is not going away.KURTZ: Right. We're not going to find out much more before Tuesday in election but this is not going away seems a safe assumption. Ed Henry, great to see you.HENRY: That's what I'm sticking to, the facts.KURTZ: Thanks very much, Ed. Still to come, a devastating legal loss for ""Rolling Stone"" magazine, and some final thoughts on the coverage of this campaign.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Look at this. ABC national reporter Lindsey Davis doing a live shot in South Carolina where a sex offender had allegedly held a woman captive, but that yellow police tape behind her is phony. Put up by her crew. That's right. ABC faked a crime scene as noted by CNN. ABC calls this completely unacceptable and pulled the producer from the field, but doesn't the correspondent also have some responsibility for this troubling trickery?Rolling Stone lost a major libel suit on Friday over that utterly botched and utterly false story about a supposed gang rape at the University of Virginia. A jury held Sabrina Erdly -- she's the reporter in the case -- libel in the $7.5 million suit brought by UVA administrator Nicole Eramo and also found the magazine defamed her with actual malice. The trial showed that many red flags took place that Rolling Stone simply ignored this and not fully checking the claims of the accuser named Jackie. Publisher Jann Wenner apologized to Eramo but Wenner was way too late.Now this wild, crazy, intense, utterly absorbing campaign finally comes to an end on Tuesday -- I guess some of you cheered (ph) -- but I have to say the media have never had a worse campaign. The constant focus on sensationalism and insults and the parent (ph) candidates bear some responsibility here, drove the race into the tabloid gutter. And then it was the misjudgments and sometimes outright hostility toward Donald Trump and the far lower level of scrutiny visited on Hillary Clinton, and the repeated attempts to declare the race over and coronate the former first lady.No matter who wins, the press needs to do some self-examination here even as we gear up to cover the new president-elect.Well that's it for this edition of ""MediaBuzz.""
