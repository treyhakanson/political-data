"This is a rush transcript from ""Hannity,"" October 18, 2013. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Joining me now with reaction to this and much more, our studio audience. Oh, smart people. Hi, Tamara.TAMARA HOLDER, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, Sean.HANNITY: Show of hands. Who wants Sebelius fired? Noah, I'm surprised. I'll get to you in a minute. Who doesn't? You're agnostic.NOAH ROTHMAN, MEDIAITE EDITOR: No, I'll let her stay because getting her fired would be a political benefit marginally for the Republican Party, but letting her stay would be an even stronger political benefit for the Republican Party.HANNITY: Let me bring up one point. We -- I talked to a tech guy, graduated from Harvard, today on my radio show, and he has his own business. We spent $634 million taxpayer dollars, Penny -- $634 million. He thinks he could have had a better system -- he said he would be embarrassed if he chose -- if he spent more than a million.PENNY LEE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Look, we have a probably with the federal IT procurement system. I will give you that. I mean, if you look at Recovery.com, that was actually built with $4 million. So there is a big problem out there already on what we have for procurement. But one -- one exchange or one site isn't going to be telling...HANNITY: Penny Lee!LEE: ... the whole truth. What I -- what I...HANNITY: Who pays $634 million and has three years and screws it up that bad?LEE: I agree with you. I agree with you that we have a problem with our federal IT program. And hopefully, this will demonstrate that we actually need to overhaul it so that we do have people...HANNITY: Ellison, go ahead.ELLISON BARBER, WASHINGTON FREE BEACON: There's also a reason for why people need to be held accountable, because there was also a report in The Washington Post with Representative Robert Andrews, who's a Democrat from New Jersey, saying, I told the administration that there were these technological problems months ago, and they decided to proceed with that October 1st deadline.So someone needs to be held accountable for making the decision that that deadline was more important to make than put out a functioning product. So someone should be at least answering questions about it.HANNITY: Yes. All right, here's a question. If we -- Tamara, I'm looking at your face. I'll ask you this directly. If any business, if Apple, if Microsoft, you pick any big business -- if they spent $634 million, they had three years to get this up and running, and people telling me they're using 10-year-old technology and it failed this -- this -- this dramatically, why wouldn't that person be fired?HOLDER: Well, this -- I'm glad that you brought up capitalism, essentially, because people are -- the reason why we know that this site is having problems is because people are actually going to the site and they're trying to...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)HOLDER: Absolutely. People were trying to...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE)HOLDER: Let me -- let me finish. People are trying to sign up. We know that people wait in lines for iPhones and then they find that there are glitches.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Wait a minute!HOLDER: There are people waiting in line...HANNITY: I just asked -- listen, I just asked you a question. Hi. Good to see you.HOLDER: Hi. Good to see you. You asked a question that...(CROSSTALK)HOLDER: ... your source -- I mean, I'd like to know, wouldn't the American people like to know who your source is? All the millions of people who are watching the show...HANNITY: The source for what? Which part?HOLDER: Your confidential source...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Look, I'm telling you I have talked to more tech people that understand set-ups like this. They could do it cheaper, faster and it would more efficient than it is now. And I'm looking at -- the average person out there...HOLDER: You know what? I can do your show better than you! But that doesn't mean I can. Anybody can say that! I can do the site better!(CROSSTALK)PETE HEGSETH, CONCERNED VETERANS FOR AMERICA : Typical government. This is typical government. It's what government delivers. And you see it at the Department of Veterans Affairs with the backlog. You see it at the DOD with billions in overrides. When government tries to do something that it ought not do -- now, DOD's legit. VA's legit. Why would we think that health care and delivery of health care is going to be inefficient? And that's why...HOLDER: It may be wrong. It may be wrong.HEGSETH: That's why Congress --HOLDER: ... but two weeks into it? You've been complaining about it before it's even started.HEGSETH: The biggest indictment of this law is that Congress and others carved themselves out of it from the beginning!HOLDER: OK, well...HEGSETH: Because they knew it was going to be a disaster!HOLDER: Repeal and amend it.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Hang on. But you're not addressing the bigger question. The bigger is, this is a boondoggle that is (ph) every person out there contributed to that $634 million failure. Now, you know what? $634 million in a world of billions and trillions that we discuss now may not sound like a lot of money. But that's money out of the pocket of carpenters, electricians and plumbers and receptionists and lawyers and doctors.Yes, Dave?DAVID WEBB, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: Sean, I've actually worked in the federal government in an automation position dealing with a lot of data, the type of data the Census Bureau carries and has to transmit during the decennial census. Comparatively, this is one of the biggest boondoggles. When I have dealt with data, it has come from old SQL database to Windows database and having to do those kind of transfers. What you see here is inefficiency.But what we ought to go to, not (ph) to the argument over ObamaCare, but over accountability. You're right. In any corporation, somebody would be held accountable for this kind of boondoggle. But with taxpayer dollars -- in a corporation, it's private money. That means the corporation can keep you. But here it's taxpayer dollars wasted.HANNITY: I have a question...WEBB: And -- and final point...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)WEBB: ... taxpayers not being served if you accept the ObamaCare premise that we're here to serve you!HANNITY: Is there any one liberal here? Because we've split it up equally...(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: ... any one liberal here that thinks that Kathleen Sebelius should be held accountable and fired for this debacle?KISHA HEBBON, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Well, I think she should be held accountable because, obviously, something is wrong. You pay this much money and then there's all these glitches. Now, and that's not to say that that can't happen in any business. But I don't think she should be fired. I think they need to...(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ... she will be fired!(CROSSTALK)HEBBON: But it's not just her decision! That decision can't -- yes, accountability...(CROSSTALK)MATT MCCALL, PENN FINANCIAL: The American people are the shareholders! We're the shareholders of this company, the company that is America. We want them out because if this was IBM, this was a tech person, they spent all this money, what happened? As a shareholder, you want that person removed from their jobs! Same thing here! We're the shareholders of this country. She should be removed!(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Wait a minute. Why not?HEBBON: ... not just one person. You need to look at who was involved in that decision. This one woman can't be held accountable for the entire government.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Go ahead. Yes.GRETCHEN HAMEL, PUBLIC NOTICE: This is just -- in any other instance, they would be held accountable for what fell underneath their responsibilities. But this is where the administration put politics before people. They knew months in advance, like Ellison said. And instead of consulting outside tech consultants, they brought in campaign techies because they were worried that this would get out. That's how hard they've...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: It's actually more sinister than that. They actually have a way to register voters on this whole thing, sort of like the ""motor voter"" law.HOLDER: I like the idea of politics before people, kind of like (INAUDIBLE)HANNITY: Nobody can hear you yet. Now they can hear you.HOLDER: Oh. Yes. I like the idea of politics before people. That's a really good phrase because isn't that what Ted Cruz did and Chris Lee? They put politics before people. You're talking about...HANNITY: I love how you distract from the issue!(CROSSTALK)HOLDER: Let me finish! You're talking about a couple hundred million dollars, which is a lot of money. That shutdown cost us $24 billion, at least, the American people!HAMEL: Ted Cruz put his constituents first. And he went to Washington saying that he was going to go there and get rid of ObamaCare. He put his people before politics...(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who are his constituents? He has 40 million Texans...(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ... about 200,000 of which are out of work...(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ... $24 billion GDP hit, that hit Texas pretty hard.HAMEL: No. If Obama can go to...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So he put his constituents first...HAMEL: No, no, no, no, no, no!UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ... his constituents are...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: We got to take a break.Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, history in the making here at the Democratic National Convention where, for the first time ever, a former president will speak on behalf of his wife, who made history of her own tonight, becoming the first female presidential nominee of a major party.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly. A mere 471 days ago, Hillary Clinton announced she was seeking her party's nomination for president. Today she reached that goal, but it did not come without controversy. Prior to roll call, mixed reaction rang out when Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii said this about Bernie Sanders.  Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. TULSI GABBARD, D-HAWAII: I am truly honored to nominate Bernie Sanders for president of the United States.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: And many wondered about the enormous enthusiasm in this room for that. Not long after, a symbolic and emotional show of party unity played out when Senator Sanders himself did the honors of announcing Hillary Clinton as the Democratic Party's nominee.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, D-VT.: Madam Chair, I move that the convention suspend the procedural rules. I move that all votes, all votes cast by delegates be reflected in the official record. And I move that Hillary Clinton be selected as the nominee of the Democratic Party for president of the United States.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That was not enough to appease some Bernie or bust holdouts who exited the convention site demanding a walkout.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(CROWD CHANTING ""WALK OUT! WALK OUT! WALK OUT! WALK OUT! WALK OUT! WALK OUT!"")(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Now we anticipate another emotional moment. This one from the former President, Bill Clinton. Hillary Clinton's husband and the keynote speaker tonight.But first we go to Shannon Bream who is down on the convention floor with the action there. Hi, Shannon.SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Megyn. There is still very much an open wound. It feels like between the Sanders and Clinton supporters. Right behind me on this stage, in a short time as you mentioned, the former President Clinton is going to speak tonight. But take a look over here at California. Last night that was packed. A number of those delegates that were supporting Bernie Sanders walked out. They don't want to be a part of tonight, and they're still hurting about what they feel like is a snub by the Clinton campaign. That is going to be part of Bill Clinton's -- really his job here tonight.He's going to talk personally about the former secretary of state. He's going to try to humanize her, try to mend some of these wounds that are still very much open tonight. Listen, you know he's a master communicator.  There is so much buzz here about people who are so excited to hear from him, but he knows he's got a heavy lift in front of him to both personalize Hillary Clinton, try to make amends with all the fractured groups here and also sell her skills. And what kind of president she would be.We've also talked a lot about today what kind of first spouse he would be.  It would be a trailblazing tradition because there's never been a male spouse of a commander-in-chief, and what a unique place to have him in the White House with her. Now, some here on the left say they're actually a little worried about it if she's elected. They feel like he is much more moderate than she is. And they worry if he's got too much of a seat at the table on these policy discussions, she won't go full steam ahead with her progressive agenda. We're standing by for his speech, Megyn, back to you.KELLY: Shannon, thank you.Later this evening, the case for Hillary Clinton's presidency will be made by the person who knows her best. Bill Clinton will soon address his tenth Democratic convention. This is a picture from his first time in 1980.  Only this time he faces a unique set of challenges, which includes separating his wife's accomplishments from his own and improving her appeal among voters, which currently stands at an all-time low.Brit Hume is our Fox News senior political analyst. He's with me now.  Were you at that convention with the young --BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: In 1980, I was at that convention in New York City when Jimmy Carter was re-nominated, and it was kind of a ball up convention, didn't go very well, and he made a very long speech. A very long speech.KELLY: Bill Clinton did.HUME: And he did indeed. And at the time people were saying this guy has got a future. He's coming. He's a comer. And he made his speech and it went on and on and on. And then there was a -- when he said, in conclusion, the place broke out in applause.KELLY: Right. And he is so worried about he had to run around doing damage control the next day. So, he addresses this crowd in a very different posture this evening.HUME: Right.KELLY: Still beloved by many Democrats and yet kind of unknown to the millennials. And so what is the challenge for him tonight?HUME: Well, there are a couple of things. First of all, this is going to be a personal address about her personally. I think he will probably gloss over the unusual nature of their marriage, which has been beset with certain kinds of trouble for a long time.KELLY: Not necessarily just between the two of them at times.HUME: Well, that's right. And of course, in his day -- and I don't know about now, but he was known as a serial philanderer, and she put up with all that for years. I don't think we're going to hear much about that phase of life tonight. And I also don't think we're going to hear much about the very different nature of the political platform on which Bill Clinton ran and governed as president, which is very different from the one upon which she is standing tonight as the Democratic nominee. So now, if you're talking about somebody who can gloss over things and make it work, this guy is magic. I mean remember his speech for Barack Obama four years ago. People felt that it was a real turning point.KELLY: He personally vouched for Barack Obama, saying --HUME: He did.KELLY: I am telling you no one could have gotten it done in four years with --HUME: And he can make it work. He is the most talented politician I think I've ever covered, and I'm very eager to see him in action tonight.KELLY: So the question is still? Is he still the most talented?HUME: We'll see. I mean, you know, he's gotten older and, you know, his health hasn't been great. And we'll see, you know, whether he's lost his fastball. But, you know, when it comes to a moment like this, it's never been a good idea to bet against Bill Clinton.KELLY: How is he going to do it, though, Brit? Because Bill Clinton governed as a centrist Democrat.HUME: He sure did.KELLY: No question. But many of the policies he put in place have been repudiated by these Democrats today --HUME: Yes. Exactly.KELLY: -- including his wife.HUME: Exactly. Exactly right.KELLY: How does he bridge that gap?HUME: Well, that's why I'm so eager to see it. I don't know exactly how he's going to do it, but I'm saying if anybody can do it, the big dog as I used to call him can do it.KELLY: How does he unify the party? Does he have any appeal, do you think, to the Bernie people who walked out even though she beat him -- I understand the DNC e-mail leak and Debbie Wasserman Schultz didn't want Bernie. That's been proven, right? But she beat him by what, 3.7 million votes?HUME: She did. She beat him without the super delegates, who were nearly all for her. She beat him fair and square.KELLY: Right.HUME: They don't believe that.KELLY: They've got to get over it.HUME: Yes, they -- well, I don't know if they got to get over it. They can do whatever they want.KELLY: That's what Sarah Silverman said.HUME: Well, I saw that, and I'm not sure if I were a devoted Sanders follower and believed in the things he believes in, that I'd be prepared to get over anything. I just might not vote this fall. My guess is, when all is said and done and they get, you know, a couple more months of Donald Trump in action, that they will eventually say, well, you got to do it.KELLY: What do you make of the breaking news tonight that she may reverse her position on TPP, this Free Trade deal?HUME: She's pretty well reversed it already.  KELLY: That she was in favor it. Then she got pushed by Sanders, saying I'm not in favor of it. And now --HUME: Oh, you mean, Terry McAuliffe --KELLY: Terry McAuliffe comes back out tonight and says, I expect her to flip back.HUME: Well --KELLY: She's going to flip back which won't come as good news to the Sanders supporters.HUME: Well, the Clintons in one way or another have always been testament to the value of flexibility in politics.KELLY: Flexibility, you say?HUME: That is what I'm trying to put it as nicely as I can, Megyn.(LAUGHTER)And you know, Bill Clinton was a free trader. And in her time, she has been.KELLY: Uh-hm.HUME: She did reverse herself or seemed to. And, you know, she might find some fig leaf way to say, well, we've added two things to this. And we've set some conditions and now we're going to go for it. But if she has any sense, she will, because TPP overall is good for the economy. If you look at it carefully, it's good for the economy. That doesn't mean that certain workers won't be hurt. That's always the case with the march of trade.  Certain workers are hurt, and they don't have as much of a voice -- I mean they have more of a voice, I should say, those are likely to be hurt, than those who might be affected by new jobs that haven't been created yet.KELLY: Well, if she goes for it, she'll be in line with Mike Pence, the vice presidential nominee in the other ticket but not in line with the Republicans.HUME: Well, I don't think we're going to hear her announcing her changing her position tonight.KELLY: I think you're right about that.HUME: We'll leave that to the Terry McCauls(ph) of the world.KELLY: You've teed up Bill Clinton wonderfully. You peek my curiosity as to what he will do. And Brit will be here when Bill Clinton speaks and we'll have his reaction after. Thank you. Good to see you.Joining me now with more, Bill Burton. He is the former deputy White House press secretary under President Obama. Great to see you, Bill.BILL BURTON, FORMER DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Good to see you.KELLY: Thank you for being here. So what do you think? Bill Clinton, I mean, he has an opportunity tonight, does he not?BURTON: Well, like you said, he knows her better than anybody else in the world.KELLY: We think.BURTON: We think. But he's going to come out here and he's going to tell the story of her life. Hillary Clinton in a lot of ways is super famous but nobody really knows details about her besides line items on her resume.  And I think he has an opportunity to talk about who she is as a wife, who she is as a mom, who she is as someone who has been fighting for kids and communities all of her entire career. So --  KELLY: He's a character witness, you think, not so much a former president tonight?BURTON: I think that's probably right. I think to the extent that this convention is about anything. It's about Hillary Clinton and it's about the future. So I don't think he's going to come out and extol too much about his own presidency. I think it's going to be about her and her vision and who she is as a human being.KELLY: Have you been surprised by how split the Democrats have remains coming into this event, this week?BURTON: You know, I am surprised. I thought that there would be a lot more unity than we've seen. But, you know, in 1992 when Bill Clinton was nominated, the Jerry Brown delegates were pretty angry as well and they spent the first couple of days making a lot of noise. And it actually was similar to this. A bunch walked out, and frankly the ones who walked out were the ones making the noise in the convention hall. So, I think that you'll see some smoother sailing going forward --KELLY: Bad move to walk out. Really can't be heard.BURTON: I mean the guys with the Peter Pan hats who were walking out, you know --KELLY: I think it's Robin Hood.BURTON: It wasn't Robin Hood.KELLY: I'm pretty sure it was Robin Hood, although, you know, I'll have to check my fairy tales.BURTON: (INAUDIBLE)KELLY: What do you make of the latest polls coming out showing her losing to Trump in a couple of polls, showing her unfavorables now at a record high? I mean, is this week going to get her past that?BURTON: Well, that's what you hope. You know, when you take a poll, what you do is generally you talk about the positives of one person, the positives of the other person, the negatives, and the negatives. This poll was taken in the middle of that process. And so the Republicans got to make their case for Trump. And people, you know, even though it was a mess of a convention, you know, was probably net neutral, a little positive for Trump because --KELLY: He got a bump.BURTON: Yes. Because the people who looked at the speech, who wanted to hear what they wanted to hear heard it. And this week you're getting the opposite. Right? You're getting Hillary Clinton making her case on the economy, on children and education and all those different things.KELLY: And even that out.BURTON: Yes.KELLY: Okay. So now, where does that leave us at the end of this week going into, you know, early August as this general election campaign really fires up in earnest? Do you worry about the polls, like the CNN poll yesterday that showed him up now over Hillary Clinton and even his Real Clear Politics average now shows him up over Hillary?BURTON: Look, I think that she is going to win, but I think that she also might not. But there is a pass to Donald Trump winning and if Democrats don't coalesce around her, there could be real problems going forward. But the thing to keep in mind is that the real fight is going to be over white working class women, and I think that as people engage more in this race, as we get into this new phase where people are really paying attention, I think that Hillary Clinton has a great shot of getting a real majority of those voters and that's going to be the problem for Donald Trump. Is that his appeal is so limited in that area.KELLY: President Obama, your former boss, speaks tomorrow night. And obviously he's got an inherent gift because he's the leader of the party.  He's the leader of the country. He has an air of authority. We all respect our president. How much good can he do her tomorrow night?BURTON: I think he can do her a lot of good.KELLY: Especially because we know, just late on the line. You know, the Obamas and the Clintons, they don't really necessarily love each other that much.BURTON: I wouldn't go that far. I think the President has a deep respect for Hillary Clinton, and they've had a very close relationship.KELLY: You didn't have to go that far. I said it.BURTON: Okay. Okay.KELLY: It wasn't Bill, President Obama. It wasn't Bill.BURTON: That's right. That's right. But, you know, the thing that President Obama has to do is follow the first lady, and I think that that's something he has in mind. He's so competitive like at everything. And I'm sure that he's thinking he wants to do as much as he possibly can for her.  And the truth is with his approval ratings going up across the board, he has an opportunity to appeal to a broad set of voters.It's not just certain parts of the Obama coalition. It's, you know, the broad set of the American electorate. So I think he's going to come out and he's going to make the case for, you know, if we elect Donald Trump to be the President of the United States, we're going to stop a lot of the progress that he was able to make with the American people on a whole host of issues. And I think that's going to be a lot of what he talks about.KELLY: Remind me never to follow the First Lady anywhere she ever speaks ever.BURTON: Yes.KELLY: Yes. Thank you for that.BURTON: I don't think you'll have to, though.KELLY: I won't because now I'll make sure it doesn't happen.BURTON: There you go.KELLY: Bill, great to see you.BURTON: You too.KELLY: As we wait to hear from former President Bill Clinton, we are also watching to see how the Democrats address a horrifying terror attack in France where soldiers from the Islamic State beheaded a Catholic priest inside his church. It's not soldiers. It's just terrorists from the Islamic State.Plus moments ago, Michael Brown's mother, a Ferguson, Missouri, took center stage endorsing Hillary Clinton for her stance on police reform. Critics say the move by the DNC to include this particular mother in the presentation tonight set the wrong tone. And Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is here on that right after this break.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SYBRINA FULTON, MOTHER OF TRAYVON MARTIN: Hillary is one mother who can ensure our movement will succeed. I want to thank you for standing with us and supporting us, and we'd like to leave with you what God has given us.  Strength, love, and peace.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Breaking tonight, moments ago. Women known as the mothers of the movement received a standing ovation here at the DNC, followed by chants of ""Black lives matter"" as they took center stage to endorse Hillary Clinton.  These women all lost a child in violent incidents. But the DNC is taking heat for its decision to feature the mother of Michael Brown since the Department of Justice determined that Brown was the aggressor when Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed him in Ferguson, Missouri. The crowd here did not seem to have an issue with that. Watch the welcome.(CROWD CHANTING)KELLY: Joining me now, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, author of the new book, ""Writings on the Wall.""Great to see you, Kareem. Thank you for being here.KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR, AUTHOR, ""WRITINGS ON THE WALL"": Great to be here, Megyn.KELLY: So let's just talk about the mother of Michael Brown, and then we'll get to what actually happened here on the stage because she's been the most controversial choice, and she's the reason some of the Republicans are objecting, because her son was killed but was killed after addressing toward the police officer. Your thoughts.ABDUL-JABBAR: Well, I think that that is really nitpicking. All of those women had really a tremendous amount of grief and tragedy in their lives, losing their children for no good reason. Even Michael Brown was unarmed.  So, you know, to say that, you know, he might have been aggressive, it might be true. I wasn't there. But I think the real issue is why are police officers oftentimes so aggressive with Black people, people that they don't know or don't understand, and they make conclusions and decide that these people are dangerous and they kill them with no justification?KELLY: Let me just clarify the matter of Michael Brown because there's a lot of confusion about this. He was -- his case helped lead to the birth of Black Lives Matter and the hands up, don't shoot mantra, which turned out to be a lie according to the DOJ. And this is from the DOJ's report.  They said, Officer Wilson and other witnesses stated that Michael Brown reached into the SUV through the open driver's window, this is the cop car and that he punched and grabbed the police officer.This is corroborated -- this is from the DOJ. This is corroborated by bruising on the cop's jaw, scratches on his neck and the presence of Michael Brown's DNA on the cops collar, shirt, and pants. And the officer's DNA on Brown's pants. The DOJ made it very clear that Michael Brown was the aggressor against the police officer who was just doing his job and that he turned around for some inexplicable reason and came after that cop even though he didn't have a gun and the cop did, and Michael Brown knew that.That case is very dicey. It doesn't speak to all the Black Lives Matters incidents. It's just the most controversial and it's the one that the police officers have said it's an insult to us to have the mother of an aggressor toward a cop included in this group of mothers who are the mothers of fallen men whose cases are much more clear.ABDUL-JABBAR: I don't understand what you're asking me to explain.KELLY: Whether she should have been included.ABDUL-JABBAR: That wasn't up to me. I understand what you're talking about. My grandfather and father both were police officers. I understand that we have to conduct ourselves in a way so that all our police officers come home at night. They are the glue that holds our society together.KELLY: Mm-hmm.ABDUL-JABBAR: But exactly why they included Michael Brown's mother, I couldn't give you the reasons for that. But I know that there are far too many examples, over 100 -- in 2015, over 100 Black Americans were killed by police officers. And these were unarmed Black Americans.KELLY: Do you think that white society generally has no real understanding of what it is like to be a black man in today's America?ABDUL-JABBAR: I think that white society devalues and dismisses the value of Black Lives. That's what the Black Lives Matter is all about. They seem to think that blacks are prone to violence and wish to harm them, and as soon as anything gets contentious between them and a black person, they pull out their gun and kill that black person, and that eliminates any problem that they might have.KELLY: You're talking about white law enforcement?ABDUL-JABBAR: I'm talking about white law enforcement. I'm talking about want to be law enforcement people like George Zimmerman who killed Trayvon Martin for no good reason. Trayvon Martin was just going from the convenience store to where his father was. Hadn't committed any crime.  Why is he dead?KELLY: Why are race relations so bad right now in the country versus, you know, eight, 12, 16 years ago?ABDUL-JABBAR: I think race relations are bad right now because things are changing. People of color are becoming more of a majority in our country.  It used to be that the majority of people in this country were white Europeans. That's starting to change now, and I think that white people are starting to feel that maybe their sense of power and privilege is being challenged.KELLY: Some. I assume you don't mean to paint everybody with that brush?ABDUL-JABBAR: No. No. Some white people might feel that, and they might feel threatened by the fact that --KELLY: I realize this is more than a 30-second answer, but how do we start to get past it?ABDUL-JABBAR: I think we start to get past this by communicating with each other, by having police officers and police agencies make a sincere effort to communicate with the people that they are supposed to protect and serve.KELLY: Mm-hmm.ABDUL-JABBAR: And I think that the people in these communities that are having problems with the people that are policing them, they need to realize that if they show some respect and some restraint, police officers can meet them halfway, and we can go about the business of uniting our country and having a nation where all lives are respected and appreciated and no one has to feel that they're being persecuted. Black Americans really feel that they're targets and after all this insane cowardly murders of police officers, I could see where they would feel assaulted and violated, and we have to get past that.KELLY: Amen. Thank you for being here.ABDUL-JABBAR: My pleasure.KELLY: Great to see you.ABDUL-JABBAR: Nice talking to you.KELLY: Joining us now with more, Kevin Jackson, he's a FOX News contributor and a conservative radio host.Kevin, what do you make of that? I mean, Kareem's last point, pretty thoughtful, that, you know, some of these young men in these communities where we've seen these incidents happened need to be more respectful of the police, but the police need to think more about community policing and respect of, in particular, the young black men who they pull over in so many of these incidents that we've seen go wrong.KEVIN JACKSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you know, here's what I think about it. I think if you made all the cops who dealt with blacks in America black, you'd have the same problems. And then what would they say? They couldn't blame racism at that point. We haven't looked at the stats of how many of these kids that are killed are killed by black cops. Most of the time in policing, they tend to put people of the same ethnicity in the same ethnic corridor. And, you know, a lot of things Kareem talked about until the last point, quite frankly, were ridiculous.Look, cops are not the problem here. To have that lady come speak when her son was a criminal who tried to kill a police officer is a travesty. It is a slap in the face of law enforcement and there's no other way to talk about that. And the optics of this on the heels of two brutal police assassinations of five police officers in Dallas and three in Baton Rouge and going on all around the country is quite frankly -- it would be frightening and it is frightening thinking that Hillary Clinton would do this. They didn't have a single person, a police officer's wife or husband who was killed in the line of duty, as some sort of a balance to this.KELLY: They had some police officers.JACKSON: Pardon me?KELLY: They had police officers appear but not the families of fallen police officers.  JACKSON: I'm talking about the family members of cops who were killed.  They didn't have any blacks who were killed by other blacks to come tell those tragic stories. In 2016, 2,000 Black people were killed and a majority of them were killed by other blacks. Did they tell any of those tragic stories? When I was in Cleveland that weekend before, there was a two-year-old kid that got shot in a drive-by. Did they bring that family up to talk to them?Look, the police officers are under tons of scrutiny, and the criminals in this country are under very little scrutiny. And to pander -- what that Democrat convention, what's happening right now, Megyn, is they are pandering to blacks. This is not helping the situation one bit. It's making it more dangerous for blacks.KELLY: Do you think this costs the Democrats politically? Take it out of sort of the race relations discussion. But do you think politically these costs the Democrat the vote in the police officer community, that Donald Trump will win saying I am the law and order candidate. I'm with you.JACKSON: Absolutely. The many police officers who were in Cleveland -- by the way, no blacks got killed by them, and I was one of them, and there were many others. But, you know, they are upset beyond belief because they know they have a target on their back. But I also believe it's costing her votes in the black community because our neighborhoods need policing, and it has nothing to do with the fact that blacks are bad people.It has to do with the fact that unfortunately because of liberal policies, we are prone to more criminality just because of the way that we've been cordoned into these neighborhoods and don't have opportunities for jobs and many of the things that the Democrats are going to pander more to. If they gave us real opportunity, you'd see these kids wanting to go to work and you'd see a change in this. But what Hillary Clinton and the Democrats are doing quite honestly is scandalous and it's shameful.  KELLY: Kevin, great to see you. Always a pleasure.  JACKSON: You as well.KELLY: Well, it could be the biggest speech this week other than Hillary Clinton as her husband, the former President Bill Clinton, prepares to make what is being billed as an intensely personal speech. Intensely personal remarks. What is that going to sound like? In just a short time.Plus, with France dealing with yet another horrifying terror attack today, we will show you how Democrats are addressing the issue of terror here in Philadelphia when we come back. Don't go away.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS THE KELLY FILE SHOW HOST: Breaking tonight, Sanders supporters mixing it up with police right here in Philadelphia outside of the Wells Fargo Center. We are told these are folks who were blocked from coming in tonight and they are clearly unhappy out here in Cleveland -- I'm sorry -- in Philadelphia. Let's just take a look for one second. Let's watch.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYING)KELLY: Mostly peaceful marching in the streets. You can see it getting a little tense moments before we came back on the air. While much of the world's attention is right here in Philadelphia on the Democratic convention, one of America's oldest allies has once again found itself at the center of an unthinkable terrorism attack. The target this time, a church.It happened in Normandy, France, earlier today. Witnesses say two ISIS followers entered the house of worship during mass. This is disturbing, we warn you. Forced an elderly priest to his knees and slit his throat in what is believed to be the terror group's first attack against a western church. Trace Gallagher picks up the story from there, Trace.TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, French authorities now acknowledge that both killers in the attack on the Catholic Church were known terror suspects who should have been under surveillance. One of them was a 19-year-old who tried twice to get into Syria and join ISIS. He was being monitored by an electronic ankle bracelet but under the terms of his parole, was allowed to remove the bracelet from 8:30 in the morning until 12:30 in the afternoon. The attack happened at 9:00 a.m. The two men entered the back of the church, and while the 84-year-old priest was celebrating mass, the killers turned on a video camera, forced him to kneel, and then killed him. A nun who escaped said, quoting, ""they recorded themselves. They did a sort of sermon around the altar in Arabic. It's a horror."" The attackers then used parishioners and nuns as human shields to block police from entering.Both killers eventually ran outside shouting Allahu Akbar and were shot and killed by police. The Vatican says the Pope was shocked, especially because it happened in a house of worship. Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, a conservative expected to run in next year's presidential election, criticized the socialist government for being soft on terrorism and allowing terror suspects too much freedom. Current president Francois Hollande says this. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, FRANCE PRESIDENT (TRANSLATED): I say it clearly. Curbing our freedoms and departing from our constitutional rules will not be effective in the fight against terrorism and will weaken the precious cohesion of our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: And we should note that the church that was attacked apparently was on a hit list found last year in the home of an ISIS follower, Megyn.KELLY: Trace, thank you. And the fight against ISIS was just mentioned for the very first time in prime time here at the Democratic National Convention. Joining me now is Steve Hayes, senior writer for ""The Weekly Standard"" and Robert Zimmerman a DNC committee member, superdelegate too. Great to see you.ROBERT ZIMMERMAN, DNC COMMITTEE MEMBER: Great to be with you.KELLY: It's so disturbing. I mean, the terror -- it's like another week, another attack, and they -- they just get more horrific just when you think they can't shock you anymore with their terror.ZIMMERMAN: That's right.KELLY: They do. Steve, let me start with you. What do you make of the fact that we only heard ISIS mentioned for the first time at 9:22 tonight?STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD SENIOR WRITER: Yeah, I think it's a huge problem, but I think it's emblematic of the way that Democrats have handled terror -- the president has handled terror over the past seven and a half years. It's been an afterthought, and that's what it was here last night. We all remember back this convention four years ago. You had the president giving speeches, Al Qaeda is decimated.Al Qaeda is on the run or speeches that the administration and senior counterterrorism officials gave before that basically declaring the war on terror over. Well, the war on terror is not over. It's not close to over, and we're seeing now the growth of groups like Al Qaeda, like ISIS, the affiliate groups. It's a major problem, and the fact that it didn't come up on the first night of Democratic National Convention is extraordinary.KELLY: What about that, Robert?ZIMMERMAN: Well, I mean, first and foremost let's point out that my heart and my soul just ache for the people of France and for the victims and their families. It is a tragedy that should shock the world and mobilize all of us to action. Let's also realize these types of issues should be above partisan politics. But since we're at a political convention, if it comes up, let's point out the last three speakers who spoke.Joe Sweeney of the NYPD, Laura Manning, a survivor of 9/11, and Congressman Joe Crowley all addressed the issue of Hillary Clinton's record of fighting terrorism. And while the Republicans want to try to play a political game out of this issue, let's remember Hillary Clinton has a record of being part of the decision team to go after Osama Bin Laden, of course putting the strictest sanctions in the history of Iran against them.Let's also remember Donald Trump has become a recruiting tool for ISIS. He's advocated agendas like his temporary Muslim ban that Congressman McCaul, a Republican, chair of Homeland Security said, would be a recruiting tool for ISIS.KELLY: What do you make this because even though obviously these two candidates are very different, when it comes to how they'll battle terror, the lines are unusual? You know, he's talking about, you know, bombing the oil fields, you know, so that he can decimate ISIS' money source, but then sort of reversed that later. And she's more hawkish traditionally but seems to be pursuing more of the Obama agenda that's been, you know, controversial at least back here at home.HAYES: Right. Well it's hard to figure out exactly where Donald Trump is on a lot of these issues. He's been for ground troops to fight ISIS. He's been against ground troops to fight ISIS. You know, he uses expletives to describe what he's going to do to ISIS and I think that gives people a sense that he's strong and would take the fight to them, but he hasn't really detailed how.Hillary Clinton, I mean, it's just hard to buy the argument that she's been tough on terror even though she has a reputation of being a hawk. If you read her book, she goes into great detail about her role in trying to separate the Taliban and Afghanistan on the one hand from Al Qaeda on the other hand, suggesting that Taliban was gettable, that they were more moderate.They're not moderate. There's a reason we're now, seven and a half years later, having to take the fight to the Taliban because they were hand in glove with Al Qaeda, they weren't...KELLY: Two questions but I want to ask you, Robert, two questions. Retired Marine General John Allen endorsed Hillary Clinton which many on both sides we all thought was very significant that...ZIMMERMAN: Absolutely.KELLY: ...she got that endorsement from him. Very well respected, led the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan among many other accomplishments. And yet the Democrats come here to Philadelphia, they've got the world watching them, and they come under fire because they had no flags on the stage.They had no flags in the arena, and only once they got criticized on why did they bring in flags here and really this sounds silly, right, to many people, but I can tell you that to many other people, they're wondering is there a lack of patriotism? A lack of the understanding of love of country and the threat that they feel they're under.ZIMMERMAN: First of all, it's worth pointing out the entire stage was done in a red, white, and blue motif -- red, white and blue design for he entire stage, but the bigger point is it shows you debase the dialogue is when you start attacking the patriotism of people you don't agree with. I mean, very frankly, Hillary Clinton whether you agree with her or not has served nobly and heroically and taken some very tough hits in public service.And her patriotism is not in doubt. That's never been a question. And of course, the Rush Limbaugh's of the world are going to try to make that an issue because they can't deal with the real issue that Donald Trump is a candidate that our generals have criticized. His strategies that would make us weaker not stronger and that's unprecedented.KELLY: I got to ask you, Elizabeth Banks, a well-known actress, if you haven't seen ""Pitch Perfect"" you should...ZIMMERMAN: Right.KELLY: ...is speaking now, a very well-known woman. We haven't even touched on the fact that history was made today. And you as an avid Hillary Clinton supporter from the beginning deserve a moment on that.ZIMMERMAN: Well, thank you for that moment because I think tonight -- and this has been an important part of my life during her first lady tenure, when she was my senator in New York and of course the last presidential run and now. What's important to remember is, yes, we made history in the Democratic Party, but more importantly, we made our country stronger today because when we break down one barrier in our party -- we break down one barrier, we empower everyone to step forward.And that's what makes this such a special night. And the whole country should take pride in seeing this move forward, whether they support Hillary Clinton or not, we should all be proud that a major national political party has recognized the importance of nominating this extraordinary woman for president.KELLY: Great to see you. Greet to see you too, Steve. Thanks for being here. Again, we are live in Philadelphia for the Democratic National Convention, awaiting a much anticipated speech. What's he going to say? How far is he going to go with the intimate discussions? Maybe that was the wrong choice of words.President Bill Clinton will be speaking tonight. He's been doing this for years, right? Forty years he's been speaking at these conventions, but it's been a long time since so much has been riding on the Clinton legacy as it is tonight. President Bill Clinton at the DNC right here, coming up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE/FEMALE: Locker her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Well, that was Bernie Sanders supporters chanting ""lock her up."" It's a phrase that touched off a fierce media backlash last week after GOP voters kicked off the slogan last week at the Cleveland convention.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE/FEMALE: Locker her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: My next guest, a Republican, is deeply discouraged by that chant, calling it cheap, adding it will not help defeat Mrs. Clinton this fall. Joining me now, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona. Good to see you senator. Thank you for being here. So, why do you have a problem with it because both parties are doing it although different factions within the Democratic Party?SEN. JEFF FLAKE, R-ARIZ.: Well, it just doesn't seem they we're very serious if we're chanting that. There's plenty about Hillary Clinton's record that we can go to. But when you start with ""lock her up"" then it just discounts your other arguments and so I don't think that that's our best foot forward.KELLY: What did you make -- this is your first interview since you had, for lack of a better term, a dust-up with Donald Trump. He went to Capitol Hill. He met with some lawmakers, including yourself, and you made the news by saying to him, ""Hi, I'm the other senator from Arizona, the one who didn't get captured, and I want to talk to you about statements like that,"" which is a pretty bold opening. How did that meeting go between the two of you?FLAKE: Well, I did mention that -- he mentioned that I've been critical of some of his statements, and I said, yes, I have, particularly statements like that said about John McCain, a true war hero. And to say you can't respect somebody that was captured, that's just beyond the pale. And to never have apologized for that, I think that's insulting to a lot of veterans and a lot of POW's.And then to make statements to a judge born in Indiana, calling him a Mexican in a derogatory way, that doesn't do anything, to reach out to people we need to reach out to. And so I have been critical, and he didn't appreciate that.KELLY: And now it sounds like Trump is going to come after you because he's got a super PAC who he says he's going to -- he's hoping to go after Senator Cruz, John Kasich, and some other person he says who's so actually such a small person, he hates to give the person publicity, but they believe it may be you.So, you're in a difficult position because your party's nominee does not like you and it may be mutual from the sound of it. And yet you're no Hillary Clinton fan at all. So, what do you do sir?FLAKE: Not at all, not all. Let me say, I'm not part of the Never Trump Movement. I want to be able to support our nominee. I just can't as long as he is making statements about Hispanics and other groups the way he is because, one, I don't think that that's right. And, two, that's no way to win a general election. So, I just don't think he can do that by insulting so many groups along the way.And there is a good case that can and should be made against Hillary Clinton both on domestic and foreign policy. But as long as we're doing things like chanting ""lock her up,"" it just doesn't allow us to get to those serious policy differences that we have with her. That's my problem.KELLY: So, you haven't made up your mind?FLAKE: No. I hope to be able to support Donald Trump. I'm not there yet. I hope that he changes not just some of his positions. He seems to have been backing off the Muslim ban. That's a good thing. And I should say during the convention when people were shouting ""lock her up"" during his speech, he didn't encourage that. That's encouraging, I think.KELLY: He said, no, let's vote.FLAKE: Exactly and that's good.KELLY: Senator, it was a clever line. Thank you for being here and giving us the lowdown on your position. Great to see you, Senator Flake.FLAKE: Thank you.KELLY: Joining us now with more, Trump supporter and attorney David Wolf. So, even if you like Trump, you have to admit that's a good opening line by the U.S. senator, ""I'm the other one."" Okay, but putting that to the side, there is still some reticent, some reticent, as we see these Democrats divided behind me between Bernie and Hillary and they can't quite come to grips to the fact that Bernie has lost. There are still some Republicans that can't quite come to grips with the fact that Trump has won.DAVID WOLF, TRUMP SUPPORTER: Well, Megyn, one of the exhilarating things about supporting Mr. Trump is that the bonds of political correctness are shattered. I mean these people are engaged in this chant, ""lock her up,"" because they're frustrated with the fact that over and over and over again, Hillary Clinton is documented to have committed offenses, then we get the Department of Justice saying, well, you know, the statute that we could prosecute under (ph) is too old, or we haven't been given a referral to prosecute her under a perjury charge or the Clinton Foundation. I don't think we're going to look into that.I mean, ordinary people see that, they see that our government is saying she's just too big to be prosecuted so frustration boils up not just with Mr. Trump supporters but with Bernie Sanders supporters saying, ""Lock her up! Lock her up!"" and to Mr. Trump's credit, you and I were there Thursday when he said, ""You know, how about instead we just beat her in November?"" That was an amazing response and Mr. Flake...KELLY: David, what do you make -- what do you make of the promise by WikiLeaks now to release even more documents, which some in the Democratic Party could believe could be very damaging, in particular on the issue of the Clinton Foundation?WOLF: Well, in the Clinton Foundation could be huge, Megyn, and I know that they have more. There's no question about that. It's a question of timing, and don't be surprised if the timing takes place just before Mrs. Clinton's acceptance speech on Thursday. What they seem to have is sort of evidence of a pay for play scandal where people contributed to the foundation and they got favors from the government.Megyn, if that happens, this whole thing is going to implode on the Democrats and Hillary Clinton, and I wouldn't be surprised about this -- this WikiLeak thing, and by the way, Megyn, people seem to be now shifting from the outrage of the Russians hacking into her computer to the outrage of what has been going on in the Democrat National Committee. Bernie Sanders, of course, was the victim of a conspiracy to destroy him.KELLY: Yeah.WOLF: I don't know why he relented, but he did.KELLY: One of the comments made there about going after his faith and even this week there was a Democrat out of Atlanta, a congressman, who suggested the Jewish settlers are like termites. I mean obviously anti-Semitic remarks. He was forced to apologize and take it back.WOLF: Unbelievable.KELLY: We saw a lot of bad moments for the Republicans last week and a lot of great ones for them. And this week, it's been much the same for the dems. David, great to see you.WOLF: Pleasure, Megyn. Thank you.KELLY: So in 2012, his speech brought down the house, President Obama even labeling him the explainer-in-chief. Tonight, will former president Bill Clinton deliver once again? His remarks are moments away. Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, we are just moments away from perhaps the most important speech of the Clinton campaign to date. As Mrs. Clinton's husband, you may know him as our former president, Bill Clinton, takes to the stage to make the case that there should be another president Clinton in the White House. ""America's Newsroom"" co-anchor Martha MacCallum is live with the New York delegation. Hi, Martha.MARTHA MACCALLUM, ""AMERICA'S NEWSROOM"" CO-ANCHOR: Hello there, Megyn. It's getting to that point in the evening. It starts to get a little bit more crunched down here. They're moving out people from the aisles. They're about to lock the room down, and that means only one thing, that Bill Clinton, the former president of the United States, is about to get the moment that he has waited eight years for. To stand on that stage and support his wife as the presidential nominee for the Democratic Party.And as you just pointed out moments ago back in 2012, it became incumbent upon Bill Clinton to change the momentum of the moment in that race. If you look back, you remember that Barack Obama was in a pretty tight situation against Mitt Romney, and Hillary Clinton finds herself in a very tight race at this point as well. So, the question is can he do the same thing that he did then? Remember he stood on that stage. He said, ""Nobody could have fixed this economy in four years, not even me. Give this guy four more years"" was the message.So now he's going to look at Hillary Clinton and all these supporters out here and try to present her in a way that gives clear contrast and a clear choice against Donald Trump. And he's a master at that according to a lot of the folks I spoke to in the New York delegation. They expect him to hit it out of the park. Can he still do it after all these years? We're about to find out, Megyn.KELLY: Martha, thank you. Joining us now with more, Mo Elleithee who served as senior spokesman and travelling press secretary in Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign and Guy Benson, he's a TownHall.com political editor and Fox News contributor. Good to see you both.GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hello.KELLY: So, what do you think of that, Mo? That's the question. You got to feel sorry for him to an extent because the expectations are so high, right? Can he do it again?MO ELLEITHEE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Look, I mean, this is kind of his home, right? This is, you know, the very first DNC speech Bill Clinton ever game, bombed. Never again.KELLY: That's the one we have the picture of him looking so young with the long hair.ELLEITHEE: But you know in 2012, that speech did turn the tide of the race a little bit. Every speech he's given here, this is his crowd. These are his people. And what he's got to do tonight, I think, is very simple. He just has to help people understand who Hillary Clinton is. You know, the campaign has this famous saying she's the most famous person in America that nobody really knows. Tonight, he just needs to go out there and tell him about the Hillary Clinton he knows.KELLY: Who's going to rehabilitate her on her honesty numbers, guy?BENSON: No one. They can't, right. So, you have to get past that. So, I think her husband is in a unique position, first of all of course as a former president, and then the husband to introduce his wife or re- introduce her for the 87,000th time, his wife to the American people. If anyone can do this and thread the needle and ignore the stuff and sort of get away with it, it's Bill Clinton.They call him ""The Great Explainer,"" and I think you're so right. In 2012, I remember sitting right around in this part of the arena in Charlotte. He came out and made a more coherent and relatable case for president Obama's re-election than I had heard to date and it felt like a shift (ph).KELLY: That's why I need this, as being able to read a room and understand what is needed. That's part of the gift, is understand what void needs to be filled right here. And what would you say the goal would be? I mean, help us get to know her how? He's going to tell us stories about loving puppies or like what?ELLEITHEE: Yeah, I mean, I think it's everything, right? If the question of this campaign is who's looking out for me, right, who's going to level the playing field and look out for me, that's what Bill Clinton is known for, you know. His entire presidency, he was known as the guy that could relate to Middle America.KELLY: But he can't talk about himself (ph).ELLEITHEE: But, he speaks -- he can speak to this group with a whole lot of credibility. If he says, look, let me tell you about the Hillary I know, let me tell you about the Hillary who has woken up every day of her life and fought for people, let me tell you about her humble beginning and how she then put that to use helping people.KELLY: Okay, but I have to ask how much, if any, does it hang over that speech that we do know, as Brit referred to it as their weird marriage. I mean, there have obviously been some infidelity issues there, some of which have been very well publicized and some of which have been whispered about. Does that impugn his ability to stand up there and make the character case for her?BENSON: I'm not sure because I feel like all of that baggage is sort of baked into the cake with the Clintons at this point. Everyone knows that that happened. It's there. Sometimes we talk about it. Usually we don't. But we're sort of moved past that point, and it hasn't been a focal point of this election.KELLY: Even if he's not a faithful husband, he's clearly her best friend. He knows her better than -- we're not electing the best couple ever.BENSON: And that's the thing, Megyn. You asked before, can he do anything to rehabilitate her trustworthy numbers? I don't think he can. Can he help on the favorability problem? I think if anyone in the world can do it, it's Bill.KELLY: Even more so than Chelsea?BENSON: Chelsea is less of a well-known commodity. I think she'll help, just like I think Ivanka Trump helped her father, but I think Bill Clinton, he's just such a raw talent.KELLY: Yeah. Guys, great to see you.BENSON: Thank you.KELLY: Thank you for being here. Joining me now, Bill Hemmer, co-anchor of ""America's Newsroom"" along with Martha who you just saw and live at the DNC floor tonight. Hi, Bill.BILL HEMMER, ""AMERICA'S NEWSROOM"" CO-ANCHOR: Hey, Megyn. Good evening. Just talked to Bill Daley, the former chief of staff of President Barack Obama. He said, how do you think Bill Clinton is going to do tonight? He said he'll do well. He's done this once or twice before. Pretty funny line about a former president who will address his tenth political convention in his political career.He will be up for matter of moments after a six-minute video is rolled out about him and his wife Hillary Clinton. Megyn, inside the arena, I have noticed Bernie Sanders supporters, they have left. I don't know if in the dozens or the hundreds, but they have left this arena, and it is noticeable by the number of empty seats here. However, you do get the sense that the destruction, the nuisance, the revolution, whatever you call it that goes around Bernie Sanders is now slowly moving behind them and all the attention is moving toward Hillary Clinton.Elijah Cummings there, a Democratic congressman from Maryland, he was just walking by here a moment ago. He said that Bernie Sanders tonight was class. And now Bernie Sanders is nowhere to be seen. We saw him come in. We saw him leave. And we're still waiting for him to pop up again. But it was a moment in that Vermont delegation that's now been whittled down to just a handful of people up there in the bowl (ph) of the arena. Bernie Sanders was here and he did apparently what he wanted to do as far as he wanted to go. Bill Clinton coming up soon, Megyn, back to you.KELLY: Bill Hemmer down on the floor in the middle of it all. Bill, thank you. What a moment for president Clinton. This could be the most important speech in recent history for him. And this one's going to have to be a little tougher because it's always tougher when you're speaking on behalf of someone you love, right? These politicians always say they can take the hits but when someone they love is in the firing line, it feels very different.And so, that will be his challenge tonight, to make the case for his wife without sounding too defensive, to sell her attributes to an American population, some of whom know her very well, others of whom do not. We pick it up there with Bret Baier in a moment.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

"This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" May 12, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone I'm Eric Bolling, along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Melissa Francis and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""Well, it's over and it sounds like it went very well for Donald Trump and the Republican Party today in Washington. The presumptive GOP nominee met with republican leaders earlier on Capitol Hill, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, who is chairing his party's convention this summer, but has yet to endorse the candidate. Ryan and RNC Chair Reince Priebus had lots of positive things to say about the meeting.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PAUL RYAN, UNITED STATES HOUSE SPEAKER: The question is, what is it that we need to do to unify the Republican Party and all strains of conservative wings in the party? We had a very good and encouraging productive conversation on just how to do that. It was important that we discussed our differences that we have, but it was also important that we discussed the core principles that tie us all together. I was very encouraged with what I heard from Donald Trump today.REINCE PRIEBUS, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: As I say productive and there was a feeling of, I think even unity in the room that we want to, we want to get to a unified party so let's roll up our sleeves and figure out how to get it done. And it was 100 percent positive. I think it's safe for me to say that there's a heck of a lot more agreement than any disagreement.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: So will all of this now lead to an endorsement from Paul Ryan?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RYAN: Yeah, I think this is going in a positive direction and I think this is the first very encouraging meeting. But again, in 45 minutes, you don't litigate all the processes and all the issues and the principles that we -- that we are talking about.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: As for Trump, he put out a tweet about the meeting saying it was a quote, ""Great day in D.C. with Speaker Ryan and republican leadership. Things are working out really well."" So like it or not folks, Donald Trump, right now is titular leader of the GOP. And I think when he accepts the nomination at the RNC convention in July you can remove titular from that title and start comfortably calling him the leader of the GOP. KG, last night we looked forward it at -- towards this meeting today, and we thought it was gonna come out all right. It seems to be -- that was accurate.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Yeah. It seems like it worked out really well. And I think it's for the good of everybody, for the good of the party. Because again, all I keep seeing in my face is like an x over the HRC, continuation of Obama legacy. So when you think about the Supreme Court, see the faces, see the people who should be there, conservative justices, because you know what's coming if she gets in. This was an important moment because people do respect Paul Ryan. He's, you know, he's respected, he's well-liked. I think Trump likes him genuinely and I think he was kind of heard upset that, you know, he didn't -- he made those comments initially. But today looks like it went well, you can you tell from Reince, you can tell from the comments of Paul Ryan. So I think it's a step forward in the right direction, which is to sit down at a table and listen to people and hear what they have to say.BOLLING: OK, Greg. Paul Ryan said that he went into the meeting and talked about -- discussed core principles, and that's 64,000-foot idea.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yeah.BOLLING: He didn't drill down into specifics, but maybe that's what they need to have unity.GUTFELD: I think, I think it's, it's not necessarily the first step towards unity, more like reconciliation, because I think there's a key distinction here. There's a lot of raw emotion to pretend that you can paper over a rift that has basically been contemptuous of principles and conservatism and has said that's not as important, you know, it's more about inside and outside, and it has insulted so many people that are conservatives, to be told that they really don't matter. And now suddenly, you do matter. I would -- what I was interested was, right his tweet which he said, ""The meeting was great.""MELISSA FRANCIS, GUEST CO-HOST: Yeah.GUTFELD: ""It was a very positive step toward party unity."" I mean, it felt like he blinked that, although I had that persuasiveness of a fortune cookie message. To me, this whole meeting was like two girls in high school who gossiped all year about each other and now they're sharing a class project and they have to work together. I think what, what Ryan did was actually really brave. He didn't come out and endorse him, because he knows there are people like me who still have legitimate concerns and Ryan is there to represent those people. If he jumped in the sack right away, with Trump, if he said yes right away, people would have said --FRANCIS: That horrible image.GUTFELD: Yeah, that horrible image.BOLLING: Also --GUILFOYLE: Oh.GUTFELD: It could be wrongBOLLING: So he has to lead him on? He has teased him a little?GUTFELD: No, he's got to play hard to get. He actually had to do the work that I try to do, to try to get Trump to understand what it's like to be conservative. Why principles matter over politics?BOLLING: Can I ask you? Can I push .GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: . here a little bit, so youth --GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: Are you saying that there's a group of people who think Trump needs to change .GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: . in order to get your vote.GUTFELD: Absolutely. You cannot make deals on principles. You can make deals on specific items, but not on principles of self-government. For example, Trump does not believe in small government. He believes in great government. That's quite a distinction for a conservative, because we believe great government predicates on the notion that it is smaller, more efficient. That has never come out of Trump's mouth.BOLLING: OK. Juan --GUILFOYLE: Did you just take a five-hour energy drink?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Did this solidify the idea that Donald Trump is running the party today at post meeting?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: No, because he didn't endorse him, but it did solidify in so many other ways. I think I read a piece today that described it as Paul Ryan being boxed in. And you think .GUTFELD: No.WILLIAMS: . boxed in by the fact that you have Senate leader McConnell, now endorsing Trump. You have the former speaker John Boehner, now endorsing Trump. You have the leaders, the heads of seven different congressional panels -- house panels endorsing Trump. So the question then becomes, who is sticking out here as a member of the party? Who is the one that's not lining up? Oh, it's Paul Ryan. And again, the pressure then comes and we had this discussion yesterday, Eric, where you're saying, hey, Paul Ryan, get in line. Got to do it, Trump has the votes of the -- most of the republicans who voted in the primary. It's time for Paul Ryan to get in line. But I got to go back to what Greg was saying. I think on some level people are saying, you know, what's the difference? Is it just a matter of you lining up because you were told to line up?BOLLING: No, here is the difference, because you're an option. It's not 17 people or 15 people or 12, it's one. You've got Trump or you've got a democrat.FRANCIS: Yeah. I mean, I totally disagree with you, Juan. I don't think that Paul Ryan is being boxed in at all. I would take your mean girl analogy in a little different direction and say, I think it's more like it's the nerd from the math club, and he's been trash-talked by the captain of football team for awhile. And they're getting together and they're trying to put their heads together and come up with something. I think Paul Ryan is totally reasonable. I don't think he would go along if he didn't believe it. But I think what unites these guys is that they can both do math, and they do both understand business, and they understand that the middle class cannot afford another Obama administration.GUILFOYLE: Right.FRANCIS: You look at median income has fallen. The divide between rich and poor has gotten so much worse under President Obama, and you look at GDP right now, slowing down economic growth. I mean the middle class can't afford to have another Obama administration. They cannot have Hillary Clinton in there, and that's what unites these guys. That's where they have the common ground for people --GUTFELD: I don't think they unite on trade.WILLIAMS: I know.GUTFELD: I don't think that they do.FRANCIS: OK. The trade thing --GUILFOYLE: Jobs, economy.GUTFELD: They know.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: If you have -- if Trump's advice, which is to bring jobs back, that will all prices will go up.FRANCIS: OK.GUTFELD: Let's admit that. If you put tariffs on goods, which is apparently our attack on China, all prices will go up, correct?FRANCIS: No. Here's what --GUTFELD: No?FRANCIS: What he, get that --GUTFELD: Tariffs --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Our taxes.FRANCIS: When he did the speech on foreign policy, explained that his position on China, was about bringing North Korea to heel. And that China has the power over them. The only power we have over China is economic. The whole thing on trade isn't actually about trade. It's the opening salvo and trying to --GUTFELD: So the tariffs aren't really going to happen?FRANCIS: I don't think so.BOLLING: No -- OK.FRANCIS: I think it's an opening salvo.(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: What you are saying --BOLLING: When you could also deal with the tariffs --(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: We're going to use money to lever China.BOLLING: The tariffs could disincentivize companies from doing business overseas, bring jobs back here. Maybe bring manufacturing back here.(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: I think it's about national security.GUTFELD: Still not conservative.FRANCIS: I think it's about national security.WILLIAMS: And as such --FRANCIS: About national security.WILLIAMS: And what you just heard from Melissa is -- I don't really think Trump is going to do what he says he's going to do.FRANCIS: No, no, no. That's not true.WILLIAMS: Therefore I'll support. But this is --FRANCIS: That's not true.WILLIAMS: It's not only --FRANCIS: That's not true. It's foreign policy.WILLIAMS: It's not only trade. It's the size of government. It's social security and Medicare which Paul Ryan has said, he wants to cut.FRANCIS: Juan, if you bothered to listen to his foreign policy speech, he explained in clear detail that his policy on Chinese trade had to do with pressuring them over what's going on in North Korea. That's the only way to bring China to (inaudible) to put pressure on North Korea.GUILFOYLE: And he's very specific about that.FRANCIS: That makes sense.WILLIAMS: No. That's not the point.FRANCIS: It finally made sense.WILLIAMS: That's not the point. And I will say something --FRANCIS: It is the point.WILLIAMS: It's not just that you have Ryan being boxed in at this point; you still have outliers like Mitt Romney, who is criticizing Trump over his tax return.GUILFOYLE: That's what you were about.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Mitt Romney --WILLIAMS: Bring in --BOLLING: Mitt Romney has become irrelevant in this process.WILLIAMS: Oh, is that right?(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Everyone who was republican --BOLLING: Nice guy, great guy, well loved, but he is --WILLIAMS: Nobody, nobody but Trump is a republican, nobody but Trump. The only republican --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: But going also --GUILFOYLE: By the way, people are getting quite upset that supported the campaigns and worked for to help him to elect as President Mitt Romney. They're upset now, because of what's going on. Because at a certain point enough, already. Like if you're, you know, you have to kind of try to like deal with it and don't completely be an obstructionist to go again. I get the problem Paul Ryan has, Jack Kemp on one side, the legacy, the memory and Mitt Romney, because he was his running mate. So I get it, but --BOLLING: There are a lot of conservatives who didn't like Mitt Romney. A few at this table who did just -- but we said, you know, Mitt Romney was a better option than four more years of Barack Obama and everybody stood in line and do what they had to do to try to elect Mitt Romney. Now there's -- and the one chose on the republican side, maybe not as conservative as you like.GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: . but certainly better choice than Hillary or Bernie. Get in line, take the medicine, vote for the guy that's going to be better than the --WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: . the other evil.WILLIAMS: Well, take, you know take the big loss, that's up to you guys.BOLLING: I see.GUILFOYLE: All right. Let's see about that.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Can I give you a very quick anecdotal story, very quick. Last week, I went out to dinner with some very good friends, diehard democrats would never ever vote republican in their entire life. A couple of months ago he said, you know, I'm kind of like what Trump is saying; I'm just liking it. He stopped. He voted for Donald Trump, now Jay wants to vote -- he wants to work for Donald Trump. Last night out to dinner with a guy whose son was a big political democrat operative in New Jersey; out to dinner with him. He says to me last night. He said, you know, I'm watching the show, I agree with Jon Stewart. I don't know what Hillary Clinton stands for. I can't vote for her, I'm going to vote for Donald Trump, too.WILLIAMS: I think a lot --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: I mean you're seeing a lot of democrats coming over.WILLIAMS: I just -- I see. You've said this to me before. And I think in, I think your -- the basis of your position was West Virginia. Where I think it was 30, 40 percent.BOLLING: Forty-four percent, forty-four percent.WILLIAMS: Of the people who voted --BOLLING: And Bernie.GUILFOYLE: And you said that was an outlier.WILLIAMS: And people who voted for Bernie said they would switch and vote for Trump. And I said to you, that is not a reflective of a national pattern. We still don't see any state where, in fact, Trump is able to flip a state from blue to red.FRANCIS: But Juan, I think that his argument about people going over is true. Only it's to support Greg's point that maybe Donald Trump is --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Oh it's not.FRANCIS: Democrats take over -- you're saying they're supportive. It seems like --GUTFELD: That's the elephant in this room. That is the elephant in this room is that you know what, you're talking. What we have argued for four years, which is we don't like squishes and rhinos. Suddenly, we're bending over for one.BOLLING: Hang on. This is a very important one.(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: That's a terrible image.(LAUGHTER)FRANCIS: That's a terrible image.GUILFOYLE: You easy.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: You easy.BOLLING: There are some very good tapes. Donald Trump just spoke to Sean Hannity moments ago about today's meeting. We've got the first clip. Here it is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I thought it was a great meeting. We had a -- we discussed a lot of things, a lot of very important things. And I thought it was really a very, very good meeting. I think Paul felt the same way and everybody else did, also. I don't mind going through a little bit of a slow process. It's a very big subject. I think we have a lot of things. And I think for the most part we agree on a lot of different items and we're getting there.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right, that full interview is going to air tonight at 10:00 p.m. eastern. But let's talk a little about -- so both sides think it was a good meeting.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. I mean, where was the down side? Try to spin that as a negative. There was nothing that came out of it --GUTFELD: I saw orange smoke coming from the chimney.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: Orange?BOLLING: What does that mean?GUILFOYLE: Oh my, God.BOLLING: The pope thing?GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: No, no, no. The orange part was the good part.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: It's white smoke --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: The orange part is like --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Was it like when the pope dies --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: No. It's when they choose the pope, right?FRANCIS: Right, right, right.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Right. And they have a pope.FRANCIS: Something like that, yeah.(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)FRANCIS: I'm catholic. So I don't know.GUILFOYLE: Bolling, you are at St. Patrick's every day.GUTFELD: You should know this.BOLLING: I've should have known that.GUTFELD: You should know this.GUILFOYLE: Bad catholic, you didn't get the pope joke.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Anyone else? You're good? Want to go?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: All right. Let's take the (inaudible), yeah.FRANCIS: OK.BOLLING: Make sure you catch Trump on Hannity tonight at 10:00 p.m. eastern, and maybe KG and I as well, will probably show up. That will be tomorrow night.GUILFOYLE: (inaudible) special.BOLLING: Right. Next, the ""Washington Post.""(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: . launched a massive investigation into Donald Trump, but not the candidate who is actually under investigation by the FBI. We investigate that one when ""The Five"" returns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: You are the only person --GUILFOYLE: That lacks the outfit?(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Yes, the only person.GUILFOYLE: Sometimes --GUTFELD: They ripped off men at work.GUILFOYLE: Sometimes love from one person is enough.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: All right, a mainstream media bias alert for you now. They're not even trying to hide it. ""The Washington Post"" Associate Editor Bob Woodward of Watergate fame openly revealed that his paper assembled an army of employees to dig up whatever dirt they can on Donald Trump. He was caught telling a group of relatives yesterday, there's a lot we don't know. We have 20 people working on Trump; we're going to do a book, we're doing articles about every phase of his life. So what about Hillary? Woodward said ""The Post"" is trying to get to the essence of the likely democratic nominee. But he doesn't think anyone feels there was, quote, ""intent on her part to distribute classified information in a way that was illegal or jeopardized security."" ""The Five"" reached out to the paper and asked them if they're committing the same amount of resources to Hillary as they are to Trump. They refused to directly answer the question. Is this any surprise, Eric?BOLLING: No. No surprise or what sort.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: (inaudible) we know I would rather them do, rather than looking into Hillary's e-mail scandal.GUILFOYLE: Yeah --BOLLING: . because I think the FBI has got that locked down and sure they're going to find whatever they find. I wish ""The Washington Post"" would start digging into the Clinton Foundation, all, all the accusations that the Clinton cash book made that was so -- there were specific allegations in the book, and if -- and Clinton is denying all of that. I wish ""The Washington Post"" would go ahead and do some investigative journalist -- journalism into that. I bet you they would find stuff that -- couldn't catch, didn't find.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: That's why I really -- I think that's where the corruption is. And I just want -- I want to know more about that.GUILFOYLE: And also like news flash, because they don't, clearly don't understand what's going on here with the Hillary e-mail story because they're talking about their loss, they've lost their heads about intent, and that isn't even required as part of the element of the crime. But anyway --FRANCIS: So that's --GUILFOYLE: So there's that.WILLIAMS: I think that's what it's about.GUILFOYLE: It's not --WILLIAMS: OK. I'm just telling.BOLLING: Not required.WILLIAMS: It is required --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: No, it's not.WILLIAMS: It is.GUILFOYLE: You keep, just to keep --WILLIAMS: Anyway --GUILFOYLE: You keep saying it Juan .WILLIAMS: Let me just tell you, I think on --GUILFOYLE: . it doesn't make it true.WILLIAMS: On the media bias front, this is so curious to me, because you talk about media just opening the door to any, and every time Donald Trump wants to speak, he can even call in by phone. Oh yes, Mr. Trump, please come right ahead. Hillary Clinton's response to this by the way is to say, how come you guys don't ask follow-up questions? Oh, how are you going to get all these immigrants out? How are you going to end trade -- international trade without collapsing our economy? Those questions are never asked of Trump.BOLLING: How about Hillary Clinton come on this network, then?WILLIAMS: I think she should.BOLLING: How did that -- we have a chair, right?WILLIAMS: I've been encouraging --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: There's no question.BOLLING: Will there be -- what are the odds of that?WILLIAMS: But let me just tell you something.BOLLING: No chance in hell.WILLIAMS: But do you think that we are critical -- harshly critical of democrats? Do you think that's why Obama, Clinton, don't come on the network?BOLLING: So what?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: In other networks are harshly critical of republicans and they still show up on MSNBC.WILLIAMS: Aha. Well, let me just ask you something. And you know, I'm part of this, but I was pushing for democrats to have a debate on Fox News. I think it would appeal to the audience and help them, but they are so gun- shy about Fox.FRANCIS: Yeah, they are, because they have some questions. You talk about the follow-up questions? Do you not think Megyn Kelly asked follow-up questions of Donald Trump? And we -- isn't that what started the whole kerfuffle?WILLIAMS: No.FRANCIS: I mean there are many.WILLIAMS: That's not.FRANCIS: . many, many follow-up questions, as for ""The Washington Post"" and the 20 reporters, I mean, I don't think there's anything wrong biased about that. I do think they should send an army after Donald Trump. I mean, that's what happens when you have a presidential candidate. I think that's perfectly fair. I think they've sent a ton of people after Hillary Clinton, and I think that Hilary Clinton, I mean, ""The New York Times"" did turn up a lot of stuff about the foundation. I agree with you. I think there is paper play and that's where all the .WILLIAMS: Yeah.FRANCIS: . legal activity is in the foundation. But I've read a lot about in ""The New York Times"" and still people don't care. So I think you can dig up stuff, and that the average person out there are already made up their mind --WILLIAMS: But Melissa, who dug up the e-mail stuff, ""The New York Times.""FRANCIS: Yes. No, I agree. I mean, I think a lot of it is out there and go after all of them equally.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. Greg?GUTFELD: I don't think it matters, because Trump has neutralized the media through -- and it is -- I have to say something nice about Donald because he's mad that I haven't. So I'm going to say this, he's a genius at using reciprocity. For decades, he's done favors for producers and hosts, calling them in. And now in 2016, he's calling in the chits. He's like the guy who like to shows up and says, remember when I helped you move? Well, now I'm running for president. It's like those free samples you get at the supermarket of cheese and sausage. That's Trump calling into morning shows, that, you know, or offering you a hotel room or letting you, letting you get on his plane. That creates the pressure of reciprocation from the people who received the favor. It's a human need basically saying, he was nice to you, now you be nice to him. And if you don't you feel like you've welched on a deal or you are scrowned. It's a sales tactic that he's brilliantly applied to the media and to politics, and we ate it up, because we feel bad, because he's been so good to us. He has been great to us ratings-wise.BOLLING: Yeah, yeah --WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: And add something to that too, not only that but he's from the beginning -- he's been unapologetic. He said what he feels, he's just throwing it out there and it's so unpolitical. It's politically incorrect that people now, no matter what these 20 investigative journalists find, they don't have -- find something that he said to someone.GUILFOYLE: Yes.BOLLING: . in 10 years ago, and we all go, oh yeah, OK. So he said, I've heard that before.GUTFELD: Yeah. The stuff on his stern, like the stuff --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: But the point being that if he's --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: But the honesty and the forthcomingness (ph) -- forthrightness is refreshing. People are buying into it.GUILFOYLE: Right.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: It actually works in his favor.GUTFELD: It's like when President Obama admitted to doing drugs in his book. That made the question, do you do drugs --BOLLING: For everyone.GUTFELD: Irrelevant, for everyone -- yeah.BOLLING: For everyone that came after him. Agree?GUTFELD: Including me.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, exactly.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: And good for him.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: That he went on Howard Stern, what it's like -- that to me is just so desperate like grasping at straws, because he said he had a sex talk on Howard Stern, I mean --GUTFELD: Who hasn't it, right?(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Who hasn't it?GUILFOYLE: Relate.GUTFELD: We had a sex talk about you and you're not even on.GUILFOYLE: People enjoy themselves. All right, not only with the press do their jobs (inaudible) Hillary, but Clinton also has an obligation to talk to the press and not just the outlets that give her a pass. Like come on, Fox. Here's Bill O'Reilly on that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL O'REILLY, ""THE O'REILLY FACTOR"" HOST: In order to beat Donald Trump, Mrs. Clinton is going to have to come out of the left-wing precincts and appeal to independent voters. Therefore, she will have to talk to people like me and answer responsible questions. Trump talks to everybody. He's on MSNBC all the time. But Hillary Clinton is very cautious granting interviews. At this point she might want to rethink that strategy. If she truly believes that she's the right person to run this country, then Hillary Clinton should talk to all Americans, not just ideological soul- mates.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: We couldn't have said it better ourselves, which is why we played that SOT, right?GUTFELD: I could have said it better.GUILFOYLE: No, not again.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: But Bill would even admit that. He would say if only I could match Greg's expertise.GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: But let me just say, before we end the segment.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: That there's one study that I saw in our research packet today that really surprised me, it said, in fact, there have been more negative stories about Mrs. Clinton than there have been about Trump or Bernie Sanders, and fewer positive stories about Hillary Clinton than there had been about Trump or Sanders. Sanders gets ignored a little bit because nobody expected him to do this well. But the idea that Hillary Clinton is not subject to media scrutiny, I don't think that's true.FRANCIS: I mean, she would be a fool to go on with O'Reilly, because he would just grill her and she have to answer --WILLIAMS: I think she would be smart. I think she would be smart to come on Fox.GUTFELD: It would be like Benihana (ph).FRANCIS: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Yeah, but that's the problem. If people think --FRANCIS: All right.WILLIAMS: They're going to get chopped up --FRANCIS: Yeah.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: They don't come.GUILFOYLE: I'm taking heavy traffic in the ear here. All right, President Obama, Harry Reid and other democrats have blamed republicans for the rise of Donald Trump, but not Jon Stewart. He blames his fellow liberals and you're gonna hear why, next. Don't move.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: In a recent podcast the Progressive Pope Jon Stewart blamed Donald Trump's rise on the left for not making government awesome:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JON STEWART, FORMER ""THE DAILY SHOW"" HOST: And I'll lay the blame then with the Democrats. The door is open to an (beep) like Donald Trump, because the Democrats haven't done enough to show to people that government that can be effective for people, can be efficient for people. And if you can't do that, then you've lost the right to make that change, and someone's going to come in and demagogue you.DAVID AXELROD, FORMER OBAMA STRATEGIST: Yeah.STEWART: And that's what happens.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: I think they bleeped out ""amazing guy."" Anyway --(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Then he went after Donald's motto.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEWART: When was America great? When was -- what is this time that he speaks of, '81-'82? Like, what are we talking about? And who took your country away from you?AXELROD: Those, those --STEWART: Think of the argument with the Founders. Take it up with the Age of Reason. That's the, you know, all men are created equal. That's (beep) the whole thing up.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Now Jon is right about blaming liberals for Trump, but for the wrong reason. It's not because of their failed attempts at governance, it's the left's inmate anti-Americanism as reflected in Stewart's mockery, just there, of our country's previous greatness.Perhaps if Stewart would have been less insulting about the country that made him beyond rich, there would have been no need for that ""Make America Great Again"" hat at all. Maybe America wouldn't have been so drained by the ceaseless teachers' lounge assumption from Stewart and his imitators that love for one's country is the stuff of rubes with missing teeth.True, Jon was dearly loved by the media. Just witness the convulsions of excitement over this brief sighting. But it's in that interview that he revealed how out of step he really is. It's never been about immigration or assimilation. It's been the sense that the country has lost the will to sell itself to the people who come here. We could never tell new arrivals that America was great, for that violated the liberal decree that Stewart himself championed.By mocking our country's goodness, he repeats the blunder that made Trump something no one had ever expected: the new Jon Stewart for an angry, anxious world.You know, just a superficial question, Melissa. So why is it that when everybody leaves media, whether it's Letterman, when Conan did, Colbert, they all grow big beards?FRANCIS: They do. They instantly look homeless. I mean, it looked like he had been living on a street corner. Or they look like Santa Claus, as in Dave Letterman.GUTFELD: Yes.FRANCIS: You know, he's got the big beard.He's right. I mean, it is, in part, the fault of the Democrats of not making government seem fantastic, because the government is not fantastic.GUTFELD: Yes.FRANCIS: I mean, that's what he's like they didn't sell big government as being a gift from God. You're right, because it's not. It's inherently awful. So he is right about that.I mean, this -- it's just -- it's classic. He comes out. He wishes he had the microphone back where it was before. I guess he shouldn't have given it up, because he liked telling people what to think.GUTFELD: What do you think of my theory, Eric, that because Trump is basically the first entertainment candidate, that he actually is the Jon Stewart replacement?BOLLING: OK, I'll take it. Fair enough. But is Jon Stewart comes back, he's going to take his crown back. The guy's brilliant.But here's the -- OK, ""Make America great again."" We know where that originally came from, right?GUTFELD: Me.BOLLING: Ronald Reagan did it in post-Carter years when there was the malaise. America was -- remember it's morning again in America again?WILLIAMS: I remember.BOLLING: That was after years of Carter's horrible economy. Donald Trump wisely said, ""You know what? Carter/Obama. I'm going to juxtapose the two of them by saying make America great again. Because under Obama, we've had eight years of stagnant wages. We've had unemployment. If you add back in the people who have totally given up looking for jobs. Unemployment is still elevated.""WILLIAMS: Oh, yes.BOLLING: And growth is still sub-par.WILLIAMS: This is making me nuts.BOLLING: It's a crappy economy.GUILFOYLE: Why?WILLIAMS: I'll tell you why in a minute. First Melissa and then -- just a second. Let me just take a moment here and say we have had a terrible recession. We've had, I think it's 70 or 80 months of continual growth in our GDP. We have a country that has -- you talk about unemployment. We have 5 -- wait, wait, wait, let me finish -- we have 5 percent unemployment.BOLLING: Just don't make numbers up, please.WILLIAMS: But we have the lowest unemployment since, I think, the '80s or something. And then on top of that...BOLLING: Eight or nine?GUILFOYLE: What?WILLIAMS: No, since the '80s, I think. That's 5 percent unemployment.BOLLING: Juan, if you put the 95 million people who have given up looking for work back into the workforce...WILLIAMS: This is another fallacy.FRANCIS: Median wages have fallen.WILLIAMS: Guess what?FRANCIS: Worst recovery in the history...WILLIAMS: We have come back from the deep...FRANCIS: ... of time, since they have started keeping numbers. This is the Federal Reserve saying this. Math, math, math.WILLIAMS: This is the deep hole -- it's the truth, truth, truth that hurts you, because the truth is our economy is doing so much better than anyone could have anticipated after the '08 recession.GUILFOYLE: You know what? Your team won. Barack Obama, his failed economic policies.WILLIAMS: What failure?GUILFOYLE: ... called on the free market, on...WILLIAMS: If it was failure -- I see. If it was failure, Wall Street would not be where Wall Street is doing so well today.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.OK. As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted.WILLIAMS: By who?GUILFOYLE: By you.WILLIAMS: Me?GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: I thought it was Greg.GUILFOYLE: No. President Barack Obama and his policies literally -- literally squeezed the middle class almost into extinction.WILLIAMS: Oh, I get it.GUILFOYLE: And that's why it resonates when Donald Trump talks about that.WILLIAMS: I see. Our middle class is not invested in Wall Street. No, no, no.BOLLING: Can you just do us all a favor? Wall Street is doing well. Exceptionally well.WILLIAMS: Thank you.BOLLING: But that's it.WILLIAMS: Oh, that's it? I see.BOLLING: No one else is participating in that.WILLIAMS: So unemployment doesn't matter.GUTFELD: We're turning into a crazy show, people yelling, and I -- it's giving me a headache.All right. Ahead, some fast food workers are about to feel the consequence of the fight for 15. As we've warned, their wage hikes will soon cost them their jobs. Next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GREG JARRETT, FOX NEWS: I'm Greg Jarrett in New York with some developing news. And some good news: the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation just now confirming they have found the missing girl -- there's her picture -- Carlie Trench. She's safe, and her accused kidnapper, which is her uncle, Gary Simpson, now reported in custody.Police had said Simpson took the child out of school about eight days ago without authority. Investigators couldn't figure out where he took her. Earlier today, they said they had information that Carlie was in imminent danger. But minutes ago, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation tweeted out these words, ""It's confirmed Carlie Trent is safe. Gary Simpson is in custody.""Apparently, one or more private citizens found them safe and, presumably, headed now for a reunion with their relieved family. We don't know yet exactly the circumstances surrounding the discovery of Carlie Trent, but she is safe and that is certainly good news. Let's send it back to ""The Five.""WILLIAMS: That was good news. We've had a lot of debates recently about raising the minimum wage at this very table. And we're about to have another one.PERINO: Oh joy.WILLIAMS: This week Wendy's, one of America's largest fast food chains, announced it raised its prices due to an increase in wages across the nation.And the wage hikes aren't only going to affect the paying customer. Some employees are going to be replaced by machines, because Wendy's is now rolling out self-service kiosks in more than 6,000 of its restaurants, again, due to the minimum wage hikes, they say. McDonald's is also testing out self-serve kiosks.So Gregory, is this the robots taking over?GUTFELD: It is. Forget -- minimum wage, that's secondary. If a robot can do your job, it will.But what -- the good news is it's going to create a truly organic movement. And by organic, I mean human-made. People will start going into restaurants and going, ""Is my waiter going to be human? Is the bartender going to have hands? I want my music made by a real band and not by a machine.""Robots will actually increase the value of human interaction and contact. I made a list. If people are always going to want to have human chefs, human entertainment, actors. Therapy and massage. Sales and sex work.GUILFOYLE: Well, thank God we're all recession proof at this table.GUTFELD: Well, that's the thing. We need to focus on that.BOLLING: I agree with most of that.GUTFELD: Politicians (ph) need to focus on that.WILLIAMS: Melissa.GUILFOYLE: Massage therapist, sex worker?WILLIAMS: Yes, yes.GUTFELD: Nobody wants a massage from a robot.GUILFOYLE: It depends.GUTFELD: Too hard.GUILFOYLE: If they have good hands.WILLIAMS: All right. So Kimberly...GUILFOYLE: What?FRANCIS: Wait.WILLIAMS: Kimberly, I want -- I just feel like...FRANCIS: What happened to me?GUILFOYLE: He's trying to make up.WILLIAMS: I always make up with you. I try.GUILFOYLE: ... special.WILLIAMS: So the reality is the Democrats, both Sanders and Clinton, are saying we need to get above 10 -- and I think Sanders is up to $15, right? But -- so is this, in fact, a consequence of raising the minimum wage? Or do you think Wendy's and these other people are just saying, ""Hey, we can make more money by having a kiosk""?GUILFOYLE: I think it's precipitated by the discussions, you know, of raising the minimum wage. But also there's innovation, right, in terms of what we've been seeing now with robots and Greg's obsession with artificial intelligence. It's the wave of the future.Now remember, it wasn't so long ago that we were going through McDonald's drive-through, and there would be a call center from India. Now robots.GUTFELD: Robots.WILLIAMS: When you went through McDonald's, it was a call center from India?GUILFOYLE: Yes. When you go through and you're like, ""Oh, give me -- or Burger King, give me the hat, give me the fries, give me this, whatever."" They're like -- somebody taking the call...WILLIAMS: You mean it wasn't the kid inside the window?BOLLING: No.GUILFOYLE: No, sorry to break this to you, Juan.WILLIAMS: I didn't know.BOLLING: It's both. It's both. It's what Greg -- automation, innovation. And it's also at the same time, these people are demanding a higher wage.GUILFOYLE: You agree with me.BOLLING: Both. What do you think is going to happen? You're going replace all those human workers at $15 an hour for a free worker, whatever it is, the cost.Can I give you a little talking point next time you get into this argument with the conservatives?WILLIAMS: Yes. Help me.BOLLING: So this 95 million people who are -- who have given up looking for work, it's not all because the economy is that bad. A lot of it is. But some of it is actually automation. People -- people who did menial labor are being replaced by robotics.WILLIAMS: Well, let me go -- let me go to the pro here, the business expert.FRANCIS: OK.BOLLING: I just gave you a gift, and you didn't say thank you.WILLIAMS: Of course I said thank you. Always helping me out. But I was - - but Melissa, I was going to you, because when I was looking at the numbers, it said less than 4 percent of the hourly workforce earns the $7.25 minimum wage. So it's not a significant number of people.FRANCIS: No, it's not. But if you raise it you have to raise it for everybody above them. And so I talked to one of the senior V.P.s at White Castle. He said that their profit margin is 1 percent. So you talk about, like, these big profits the owners are making. They're very, very slim. Labor is their largest cost. So of course, they're going to want to try and cut back on that. If you make them expand it, they're going to do things like automating.And you know who owns these? Wendy's, less than 10 percent of the Wendy's out there are actually owned by Wendy's, by the corporation. The rest of them, more than 90 percent, are small business owners. They're franchise owners. So this is like the little guy on the corner, who has this one restaurant, maybe two, who's trying to make a living, and you're raising the wages on him? So of course they're going to offer him an automated way to cut down on labor, he's going to do it.It's the same thing at McDonald's. I was at our McDonald's, near us, over the weekend. The guy behind the counter, nice clothes, 7 a.m. in the morning. Turns out he's the owner. I mean, he's getting squeezed. He's there trying to watch the business himself.These aren't rich fat cats that are, you know, trying to squeeze the worker.GUILFOYLE: Right.FRANCIS: They're not making a lot of money. So if you raise the wage, yes, they're going to replace those people with robots.GUTFELD: I love White Castle.FRANCIS: Do you? I find it a little too...GUTFELD: Those sliders literally are sliders.WILLIAMS: Eww! All right. That's enough. There are all kinds of...(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Those are all kinds of incredible things happening, plus games in Florida where wounded warriors have been competing this week. Wait until you hear why this swimmer gave her gold medal back. It's a story you won't want to miss, and you can see it right here on ""The Five.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)FRANCIS: All right. We just got word from The Washington Post. Apparently, they are watching the program. And they came back with their response about having those 20 reporters that were going to be on Donald Trump to dig up all the dirt. And we had asked them all day long, what about Hillary Clinton? Do you have the same number? Kimberly, what did they say?GUILFOYLE: Yes. Sean O'Rourke (ph), our segment producer...GUTFELD: Boo.GUILFOYLE: Stop. Asked them multiple times today, and they were sort of, you know, avoiding the question, answering different questions, talking about Jeff Bezos.Finally, then, after we talked about this on the show, they came back and said that, in fact, they do have the same number of reporters assigned to Hillary Clinton as they do to the Donald Trump story and investigating his background.But let's see if, in fact -- we'll hold them to that, to see if, in fact, there are stories coming out about Hillary Clinton. And perhaps even, like they said, Bob Woodward said books, articles, all kinds of things about Trump. Let's see if the same will hold true for Hillary.WILLIAMS: Well, I think they said they're not doing a book about Hillary. They're doing a book about Trump.GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: I think they got a deal for a book about Trump.The part about Bezos is interesting, in that, you know, he's the owner of the Post. He's the owner of Amazon. Right? And apparently, he was saying, ""I want my reporters, I want The Washington Post to do a better job of explaining Donald Trump.""And then you get Marty Barron, the editor of the paper, saying, ""Yes, we're putting all these resources into tailing Trump."" Now I must say, it's not just The Washington Post. I've heard the same about the ""New York Times.FRANCIS: Yes.BOLLING: You know what's strange, though? Look, if you are a great Washington Post, fantastic, love it. We'll love to read all the information you have. But why give us a hard time all day? Why not just say -- all day.WILLIAMS: Hey, hey...GUTFELD: They could pick up the phone.FRANCIS: They're watching, they responded.WILLIAMS: Yes.FRANCIS: Can we not give them a hard time?WILLIAMS: That's what I was saying. I was going to give you some advice.FRANCIS: Give them credit for watching and responding and coming out...WILLIAMS: Yes.FRANCIS: ... and saying this. By the way, I mean Jeff Bezos, he said we want the American people to know who they're voting for.BOLLING: You're saying it's OK that we called all day, and they couldn't give a straight answer?WILLIAMS: No, no, that was fine. But I'm saying give him credit.FRANCIS: Give them credit.WILLIAMS: They're paying attention.GUTFELD: Amazon.BOLLING: I did give him credit. That's the first thing I said. I'm glad, I want to read it. I'm sorry.GUTFELD: But Amazon, you have to do that...GUILFOYLE: Amazon Prime.GUTFELD: Amazon, didn't even need Prime, they would have gotten back to you.GUILFOYLE: You can get same-day delivery.BOLLING: You can get a pair of socks faster than we can get an answer about the 20 reporters.GUILFOYLE: There's someone at the door delivering them right now. But thanks for getting back to us.I mean, yes, we're glad they got back, but we were asking. It was a very straightforward question. Do you have the same number of reporters committed to Hillary Clinton as you do to Donald Trump? Calls for a yes- or-no answer.FRANCIS: But can we be fair here? I mean, people have been reporting on Hillary Clinton forever. I mean, there have been reporters...GUTFELD: She's boring compared to Trump. Let's face it.FRANCIS: ... on her for the past, you know, 30 years or whatever. Trump, you know, he was the hot topic, and then he wasn't. And now, you know, he's in the press. I mean, it kind of makes sense that they would have more people digging. Are you looking at...(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Oh no, he was always hot.GUTFELD: Please, Kimberly. Calm down.GUILFOYLE: Oh, stop.GUTFELD: He's married.GUILFOYLE: I know. As if.GUTFELD: I know. That never stops you.GUILFOYLE: Please.FRANCIS: Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.GUILFOYLE: Take that back.BOLLING: How do you know, Greg?GUILFOYLE: Then Greg, don't send me pictures of yourself.GUTFELD: With the shorty robe.WILLIAMS: So much for this discussion.GUTFELD: The leopard skin shorty robe and you asked for it.WILLIAMS: Oh, my God.GUTFELD: She did.WILLIAMS: Listen, let's get back.FRANCIS: The producer is telling me to wrap. Is my earpiece still working? All right. Let's go, let's go. ""One More Thing"" is coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: ""One More Thing."" Greg.GUTFELD: It is time for...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Greg's Robot News.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.GUTFELD: I know, Kimberly. It's getting worse.GUILFOYLE: Yes. It is.GUTFELD: It is. It's going to get really bad.GUILFOYLE: I can't wait. Admit it, it is going to be the delight of my life.GUTFELD: Siri, which is the artificial intelligence element of your iPhone, now has an assistant named Viv. So that means this artificial intelligence thing has gotten so smart it can now hire somebody to do work for it.This is very scary. And it's going to get worse. I would say by 2015 human -- A.I. will be the farmers and we will be the farm animals.WILLIAMS: 2015.GUTFELD: 2050.FRANCIS: Siri has gotten lazy? Is that basically it?GUTFELD: You know what? Now they can hire.GUILFOYLE: How interesting. So you see yourself as a sheep?GUTFELD: Maybe.I see you as a sheep herder.GUILFOYLE: Charming.WILLIAMS: On and on.FRANCIS: What's happening?GUILFOYLE: Thank God there's a real show after us. Because this is -- you want to be saved by ""Special Report.""WILLIAMS: OK. Let's move on.GUILFOYLE: All right. And in very serious news here, something very special and important happened today, because as you know on the show, we really do appreciate the sacrifice of our American military, the men and women that serve. And recently, we brought you the story about Charles Keating IV, the U.S. Navy SEAL who was shot and killed by ISIS militants in Iraq on May 3. He is being promoted posthumously to the rank of chief petty officer.Also, this just in. He has been given now the Silver Star and the Purple Heart for his valor that are he showed. So we want to again say our thoughts and prayers are with his family and thank him for his service and the rest that served with him.BOLLING: Absolutely.FRANCIS: OK.BOLLING: You're up, Melissa.FRANCIS: All week wounded warriors from across the globe have been competing at the Invictus Games down in Florida. Closing ceremonies are tonight, as you may know.Everyone is talking about a 25-year-old swimmer from team USA who was injured in the war in Iraq. She won her fourth gold medal yesterday. Britain's Prince Harry presented it to Sergeant Elizabeth Marks. But then she did something that took him by surprise. She took it off her neck and asked him to please take it back with him to England. She wanted him to give it to the hospital that saved her life after she developed a near fatal lung infection while in the U.K. for the 2014 games. The prince initially hedged, but when Marks asked him again, he accepted. A great story.BOLLING: Really, really good story. Really good story.So very quickly. This won't take long. Donald Trump stepped away from ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" the ""Apprentice"" series to go run for president. Now Arnold Schwarzenegger was named to replace him. They have a whole list of celebrities that are coming. Nobody knows when it's going to happen. But there is the first poster for the trailer.OK. Let's put this up.GUTFELD: Isn't it funny?BOLLING: Schwarzenegger is a big fan of this show. We'll just leave it at that.GUILFOYLE: I love him.BOLLING: And good luck to Arnold on taking over for Donald Trump.GUTFELD: So he's going into TV, and Trump went into politics. Remember? He went from politics to TV.GUILFOYLE: It's like ""Wife Swap.""FRANCIS: Wow.WILLIAMS: There's a feud between a few of these guys today.All right, all right. OK, so today is May the 12th, and it is National Limerick Day. So to celebrate limericks...FRANCIS: No.WILLIAMS: ... five-line poems with a funny intent, and to entertain my colleagues, I decided I would read two limericks. Here we go. This was ""The Man from Nantucket.""There once was a man from Nantucket.FRANCIS: Oh, no.WILLIAMS: Who kept all his cash in a bucket. But his daughter named Nan ran away with a man, and as for the bucket, Nantucket.Now, Greg doesn't agree with that, but yes...GUTFELD: When I heard ""Nantucket,"" I thought you were going in a different direction.WILLIAMS: Let me give you one more. Here's one more.GUTFELD: Oh, no.WILLIAMS: Here's one more limerick for you.A wonderful bird is a pelican. His bill can hold more than his belly can. He can hold in his beak enough food for a week, but I'm damned if I see how the hell he can.Yes, so Greg, that's pretty straight. And it was clean, Greg.GUTFELD: I'm offended by the swearing.WILLIAMS: Is that right? You better check with Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Yes. You're on probation, my little friend.GUTFELD: I love probation.GUILFOYLE: Yes.BOLLING: A real show comes up right next?GUILFOYLE: You know it? Real show, baby. Save us!BOLLING: Set your DVR.
