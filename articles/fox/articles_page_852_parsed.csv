MEGYN KELLY, HOST, ""THE KELLY FILE""; I think we should wrap early and give it to Sean.  He's got a theory.  He's going to bring it to you.  You have to wait five seconds, four, three, two, and take it away!(LAUGHTER)HANNITY, HOST:  I do have a theory.  We'll get to that.  Megyn, thank you.And this is a ""Fox News Alert.""By the way, Megyn, get home with the kids.  They deserve to see their mom.Eleven days before the election of Hillary Clinton, now the Democratic nominee for president -- she's running.  She's now under investigation again by the FBI, the bureau announcing earlier today that it is now reopening the case into Clinton's private e-mail private server.At this moment, Donald Trump -- he's holding a rally.  He's in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  If he talks again about her legal issues, we'll dip into his remarks.Plus, in just a few moments, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, former prosecutor -- he'll be here with us, as well as former House speaker Newt Gingrich.But first, on this busy news night, Ed Henry standing by in Washington.  He has the very latest on this new investigation which was reopened.Ed, a lot now is coming into play.  Did she understand the ""c"" in terms of was ""c"" classified when there's no A, B and D?  Why did Bill Clinton meet with Loretta Lynch?  Then we have the whole issue why was there collusion with the Justice Department, the State Department and the White House?  And Wikileaks has revealed a lot, as well.  What do you got?ED HENRY, FOX CORRESPONDENT:  They have.  Sean, a big development tonight is also a question hanging over the FBI as to how thorough their original investigation was because an FBI source tells me tonight that they are focused on thousands and thousands of e-mails sent and received by Huma Abedin, obviously, Hillary Clinton's top aide and also married to Anthony Weiner.And it was only because the FBI was separately investigating Anthony Weiner over sexting that they were able to find, Wait a second, there's thousands more e-mails here involving Huma Abedin.Now, were they sent to Hillary Clinton?  Were they sent to others in the Clinton campaign?  They're digging through all that.  Was it classified information or not?  They're digging through that, as well.  But why did they not find this in the first round of the FBI investigation?It adds to the list of questions, including why Cheryl Mills, of course, another senior Clinton adviser, was given legal immunity.  The FBI director James Comey said at the time it was because he wanted to get to her laptop. We later learned that that laptop was destroyed.Tonight, Hillary Clinton at a campaign stop in Iowa suggested she may be more nervous about this than expected because she held a news conference, something she very rarely does, and she issued a challenge to the FBI director, saying basically, Put up or shut up.  Put more information out.   Let the public -- you know, be transparent and put more information out.What's interesting about that is it's just 24 hours after the Wikileaks dump yesterday showed that even Hillary Clinton's top aides, Robby Mook and John Podesta, back in March of 2015 when the e-mail scandal broke in the pages of The New York Times did not know the full depth of the e-mail controversy.  They were e-mailing each other in real time saying, Did you know it was this extensive?  And Robby said, No, we had done a self-vet -- self-vetting, basically -- of the e-mail and were told all of it had been taken care of.So the bottom line is Hillary Clinton tonight is calling for transparency from the FBI just 24 hours after we learned from Wikileaks she kept her own top aides in the dark about the extent of this e-mail scandal.  So this is a dramatic development tonight, Sean.HANNITY:  Let me tell you a part of what my theory is.  I'm not sure I necessarily believe that this is related necessarily to Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner, and I'll tell you why.  I think the FBI, especially James Comey -- under him, I know special agents.  They have been furious with his earlier statements on this particular case.  They feel the standard has been met, the 51 percent, the preponderance of evidence to go forward in this case, and that he should not have made the definitive statement he originally made.HENRY:  Right.HANNITY:  Now, let me put up on the screen just what Wikileaks revealed specific to the Clinton server.  For example, the co-chair of the transition team said the private e-mail server was was ""f-ing insane.""   That's her own team saying this.  An aide wrote, There's just no good answer on the server scandal.  Podesta called Clinton's e-mail scandal a hot mess.  Podesta's daughter thought Clinton's, you know, comment to you, Wipe it like with a cloth, Ed, was kind of scary.  It goes on.President Obama -- now, this goes right to the White House!  President Obama, who said that he heard about it from news reports, he knew about Clinton's e-mail server and private account because he was e-mailing her on it!We know the campaign actually discussed withholding President Obama's e- mails back and forth with Hillary because of, quote, ""executive privilege."" Or were they really obstructing justice?  That's a question that needs to be answered.The co-chair of the transition team said, well, they wanted to get away with it on the server scandal.  Cheryl Mills wrote, ""We need to clean this up"" after Obama lied to the American people saying he learned about it in the press.  The campaign discussed making a joke about the e-mail server scandal.  The campaign said the president's remarks about the server don't make sense.The campaign colluded -- we learned this from Wikileaks -- with both the Department of Justice and the State Department over the released statements, and aides discussed strategies to turn over Clinton's e-mail server to the DOJ.Now, we also have the other questions that we got.  Why was Bill Clinton meeting with Loretta Lynch on a tarmac?  Why did Hillary Clinton say she can't remember 39 times?  Why did she not know the ""c"" -- this is basic 101 classification -- when there's no A, B, D, X, Y or Z, why did she not know the ""c"" meant classified?  Why was the campaign colluding with the Justice Department and getting a heads-up on what was coming out?There is much more here, and I suspect this is a lot deeper than just Huma and Anthony Weiner.HENRY:  Sure.  And what did Huma Abedin tell the FBI when they interviewed her?  They interviewed her in phase one of this investigation.  If she said that she turned over all e-mails and now there are thousands more -- some of them could be duplicates, we should caution.  But if there are any new ones, especially new ones with classified information, she is on record in a deposition with the FBI saying, I've turned everything over, and now maybe there's more.  Obviously, there could be exposure for Hillary Clinton, as well.Let's not forget she also was questioned at her home here in Washington by the FBI a couple of months back.  And so there's exposure at the highest levels of the campaign tonight, and that's why they're under such intense pressure.HANNITY:  And I have so many other questions.  Is the FBI examining the truthfulness now of Hillary Rodham Clinton?HENRY:  Right.HANNITY:  She only had a three-and-a-half-hour interview with them, but Angelina Jolie -- she deserved a four-hour interview with the FBI.  But in light of this new evidence, could she have possibly lied to the FBI?  By the way, there was a guy by the name of Dennis Hastert.  He went to jail for that very thing.  He got convicted for that very issue.Ed, thank you.  Appreciate it.HENRY:  Great to see you.HANNITY:  All right, tonight my question is, is anyone in America -- are you really surprised this has happened?  Now, if you've been following the facts like we have on this program, you should not be.  Let's start from the very beginning of this scandal.  Hillary Clinton has changed her story and purposely avoided telling the truth.  Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  The laws and regulations in effect when I was secretary of state allowed me to use my e-mail for work. That is undisputed.It clearly wasn't the best choice, and I take responsibility for that decision.I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal e-mails instead of two.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  IPhone or Android?(LAUGHTER)CLINTON:  IPhone.  OK, in full disclosure...UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Blackberry.CLINTON:  ... and a Blackberry.I have a -- you know, an iPad, a mini-iPad, an iPhone and a Blackberry.I believe I have met all of my responsibilities, and the server will remain private.In order to be as cooperative as possible, we have turned over the server. They can do whatever they want to with the server.I am confident that I never sent nor received any information that was classified at the time it was sent and received.So that leaves the 100 out of 30,000 e-mails that Director Comey testified contain classified information.I did not receive anything that was marked as classified.Director Comey said that only three out of 30,000 had anything resembling classified markers.HENRY:  (INAUDIBLE) did you wipe the server?CLINTON:  What, like with a cloth or something?HENRY:  (INAUDIBLE)CLINTON:  We turned over everything that was work-related, every single thing.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  A lot not true.  In the process of changing her story, Clinton claims she did nothing wrong when it comes to the mishandling of classified information.  But let's go back to July.  The FBI director, Comey -- well, this is what he said about it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR:  From the group of 30,000 e-mails returned to the State Department in 2014, 110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received.Eight of those chains contained information that was top secret at the time they were sent.  Thirty-six of those chains contained secret information at the time.  And eight contained confidential information at the time. That's the lowest level of classification.Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive highly classified information.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  All right, now, before James Comey made his recommendation not to bring about charges against Hillary Clinton, back in June, Bill Clinton met with President Obama's attorney general, Loretta Lynch.  That was on the airport tarmac.  And Bill Clinton allegedly boarded Lynch's plane.  He was on that plane for over 30 minutes, but Lynch claims, well, they were merely talking about grandchildren and travel.  How appropriate is that?And just this week, we also learned from a report in The Wall Street Journal that a super-PAC for a major Clinton ally, Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, donated more than a half a million dollars to the state senate campaign of the wife of Andrew McCabe.  Well, guess what?  He's the FBI director who oversaw the investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mail server!  And by the way, Hillary raised money for that PAC.And on top of that, we also note, thanks to Wikileaks, that the president exchanged e-mails with Hillary, meaning that he knew she wasn't using a government account.  He lied to all of you!And other released e-mails show that Hillary Clinton's own staff was confused extremely concerned about what she had done.  Neera Tanden is the now co-chair of Clinton's transition team -- well, she said to set up the Clinton server was, quote, ""bleeping insane.""And that's not all.  Despite Comey not recommending bringing charges against Hillary Clinton, when he testified before Congress back in July, Comey admitted that Clinton was not telling the truth about her e-mails. You may remember this exchange.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. TREY GOWDY, R-SOUTH CAROLINA:  Secretary Clinton said there was nothing marked classified on her e-mails either sent or received.  Was that true?COMEY:  That's not true.  There were a small number of portion markings on I think three of the documents.GOWDY:  Secretary Clinton said, I did not e-mail any classified material to anyone on my e-mail.  There is no classified material.  Was that true?COMEY:  No, there was classified material e-mailed.GOWDY:  Secretary Clinton said she used just one device.  Was that true?COMEY:  She used multiple devices during the four years of her term as secretary of state.GOWDY:  Secretary Clinton said all work-related e-mails were returned to the State Department.  Was that true?COMEY:  No.  We found work-related e-mails, thousands, that were not returned.GOWDY:  Secretary Clinton said her lawyers read every one of the e-mails and were overly inclusive.  Did her lawyers read the e-mail content individually?COMEY:  No.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  All right, there's also the fact that can't be ignored in all of this.  Three weeks after the Benghazi select committee sent a Clinton -- sent Clinton a subpoena in 2015 requesting that she turn over all e-mails related to the terror attack, an employee at the company that ran her server used BleachBit -- you know, the acid-washed her server in an effort to permanently erase e-mails on the server.Joining us now -- he's been following this from the get-go -- is former New York City mayor, former prosecutor Rudy Giuliani.All right, where do you want to begin because you just heard James Comey admit that the standard -- the standard in this case, which is negligent or grossly negligent -- not -- you don't even have to be negligent!RUDY GIULIANI, R-FMR. NEW YORK CITY MAYOR:  (INAUDIBLE) admission (ph) of negligent and grossly negligent is extremely careless.HANNITY:  OK.GIULIANI:  So Jim Comey didn't choose those words idly.  Those are the legal definition of what it means to be grossly negligent.  So when he said that, he essentially said there was evidence to prove that she violated the statute.  Also, the four or five times when he was answering Trey Gowdy's questions in which he pointed out that she lied to the FBI...HANNITY:  Isn't that a crime?GIULIANI:  Every single one!  That's what Martha Stewart went to jail for, for one of them, one...HANNITY:  And he had five specific lies.GIULIANI:  ... false statement.  Five specific lies, including one where...HANNITY:  In multiple instances.(CROSSTALK)GIULIANI:  ... work-related e-mails were found when she said that there were no work-related e-mails -- a thousand!HANNITY:  If I did this, would I be in jail?GIULIANI:  Yes, I'd be visiting you now somewhere in Dannemora or...HANNITY:  Would you bring me a cake with a file?GIULIANI:  Yes, I'd visit you, Sean.(LAUGHTER)GIULIANI:  You know, it's one of the -- it's one of the -- it's one of the-- it's one of the great works that Jesus asked us to do during in the beatitudes.HANNITY:  Yes, that's true.  All right...GIULIANI:  Visit people in prison.HANNITY:  Let me ask you this because they're saying today, and it broke after Comey made his remarks -- they're saying, Oh, this is related to Huma Abedin and e-mails and...GIULIANI:  You know what this is related to?HANNITY:  What?GIULIANI:  It's related to the fact that they did a completely irresponsible investigation of this case.  If you read the 302 of her interview, it's absurd.  The FBI agent doing that 302 didn't follow up on anything.  You mentioned the ""c.""  He didn't follow up on that.  He didn't ask the question, was there was an A or a B or a D or an E or an F, to find out...(CROSSTALK)GIULIANI:  She also said that she didn't remember her exit interview from the FBI because she had had a concussion and she had lost her memory. There are no questions following that, which you would expect from an agent conducting an investigation and...HANNITY:  She said she didn't remember being briefed about security, cybersecurity.GIULIANI:  Yes.  No questions like, Well, how long did you lose your memory?  Where's the documentation for it?  Let's look at the medical records.  In other words, she was questioned as follows.  Did you commit the murder?  No.  Thank you.  And they walked out.HANNITY:  What about the -- well, I don't necessarily know if it was technically immunity or a proffer arrangement, very limited in scope, but we know that there's a letter that was given -- we don't even know if one was given to Huma Abedin.  We know that in the process, evidence was destroyed in this case by the FBI as part of a deal!GIULIANI:  A tremendous amount of evidence was destroyed by the FBI, by the people working for her.  They used extraordinary methods that only criminals use to destroy e-mails, acid, bleach.  They used hammers to destroy 13...HANNITY:  She only used one -- she only used one...GIULIANI:  13.HANNITY:  She did this for convenience.  But she had -- I thought it was 14.  Are you sure?  I thought it was 14.  My recollection is 14.GIULIANI:  Well, I remember 13.  Let's say 14.HANNITY:  But they busted it with a hammer!  They took acid...GIULIANI:  Sean...(CROSSTALK)GIULIANI:  How can they all be missing?  They're all missing!  They're all gone!  It's hard to get rid of 14 or 13 cell phones.HANNITY:  I have a friend of mine who's a special agent in the FBI.  I had a long conversation with him.  He said every fellow agent is disgusted with the way James Comey has handled this.  And here's what we also have discovered, that the guy Andrew McCabe, who was promoted FBI deputy director, who supervised this particular investigation, that Governor Terry McAuliffe, one of the closest allies...GIULIANI:  Also the guy who was selling the Lincoln Bedroom.HANNITY:  Right.  That's the guy.GIULIANI:  You know, a decade -- a decade-and-a-half ago.HANNITY:  Through his PAC Common Good, which Hillary raised money for, contributed -- this is again a total now of up to $675,000 to her long-shot congressional (sic) bid.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY:  Most congressional bids don't spend 675 grand.  That's one donation!  And how could he possibly investigate with a conflict of interest like that?GIULIANI:  Well, I get two stories out of the FBI, OK?  One story is this came from the Weiner sex tapes and it's about Huma Abedin and did she send classified information to Weiner.  If she did, by the way, that would be a clear-out (sic) crime.  Let's see if she gets prosecuted.HANNITY:  Let me put up on the screen as you talk, by the way -- you have identified on this program 16, if I'm not mistaken...GIULIANI:  Yes, I did that about a year ago.HANNITY:  Yes.  This is what we've been showing you.  These are the very specific things that you said back in the day ought to be investigated. These are real felonies, real crimes.  People really have gone to jail for all of these statutes!GIULIANI:  Yes, well, I mean, the reality is that the report that Comey gave to us before he came to the conclusion that she shouldn't be prosecuted was a report that any prosecutor would have taken and -- taken before a grand jury, probably gotten an indictment.And the evidence of intent is overwhelming.  The best evidence of intent are two things -- false exculpatory statements.  Well, she made at least a dozen of those, and you just showed them.  The second best evidence of intent is destruction of evidence.  Well, they were destroying evidence all over the place!HANNITY:  That's the intent to commit a crime.(CROSSTALK)GIULIANI:  That's how I proved intent in the hundreds of cases that I prosecuted.  And the reality is that the first FBI investigation was a sham.  You don't interview somebody on a Saturday and put out a complete report on a Tuesday unless the report was written before you interviewed(INAUDIBLE)HANNITY:  Mr. Mayor, let me ask you, very specific -- as we keep those laws up there -- 18 USC 1924, unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents.  Comey admits she did it.GIULIANI:  She did it.HANNITY:  That's a crime.GIULIANI:  Absolutely.HANNITY:  OK, gathering, transmitting or losing information, defense information.  That's 18 USC 793.GIULIANI:  Did that, too.HANNITY:  OK, by the way, imprisonment 10 years and/or $250,000 fine. Concealment, removal, mutilation...(LAUGHTER)HANNITY:  ... generally, 18 USC (INAUDIBLE)GIULIANI:  ... mutilation, bleach.HANNITY:  ... hammer.(CROSSTALK)GIULIANI:  That's mutilation.HANNITY:  OK.  Destruction, alteration, falsification of records in federal investigations.GIULIANI:  Well, she did that, too.  And then I put a couple extra in...HANNITY:  All right, my final question...GIULIANI:  ... including interfering in an IRS investigation in which she called -- went to Geneva to try to stop the IRS from getting the UBS secret identities of individuals.HANNITY:  Let me put up on the -- what the...GIULIANI:  Straight-out violation of another 18 U.S. code and a quid pro quo for the $3 million or $4 million they got from UBS.HANNITY:  Let me put up on the screen again the Wikileaks revelations specific to the Clinton server.  They knew.  They knew from the beginning.Now, here's my theory.  I think they used Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner as an opportunity because the FBI, the Justice Department, the State Department and the White House are scared to death because all of them colluded individually with the Clinton campaign and gave them all a heads- up and they all protected the president, who was e-mailing on that very server and lied to the American people!  True or false?GIULIANI:  Looks that way.  Looks that way.  I mean, it looks like you have a massive conspiracy here.  And this is almost now a truism, right?  The coverup is worse than the crime.HANNITY:  Is this worse than Watergate?  Because I got to run...(CROSSTALK)GIULIANI:  ... although in this particular case, the crime was pretty bad, exposing national security information...HANNITY:  All right...GIULIANI:  ... to countries that we know can take it from us like that.HANNITY:  Mr. Mayor, thanks for coming in.GIULIANI:  For that, you shouldn't be allowed to get off.HANNITY:  A lot more to come tonight.  We have reaction from former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich to today's breaking news.That and more on this busy news night straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  They are reopening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States of America!(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Donald Trump earlier tonight, moments after the FBI announced that it is now reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mail server.Joining us now, the author of the best-selling book ""Treason,"" former speaker of the House, FOX News contributor Newt Gingrich.Mr. Speaker, good to see you.  I know you're in Woodstock, Georgia.  You had a big crowd tonight, like you have been having all around the country.Let me get your general thoughts on this.  Also, do you believe Wikileaks and the revelations about the server contributed to this, although it's not being reported?NEWT GINGRICH, R-FMR. HOUSE SPEAKER:  Well, let me start with what has happened that is extraordinary because it puts Director Comey in an impossible position.  He supposedly this summer had completed an investigation, and I agree with Mayor Giuliani, done so badly that he's now reopening it 11 days before a presidential election.I mean, this is really amazingly bad for the Federal Bureau of Investigation which has historically been a very methodical, very professional organization.  So it raises 100 different questions.But here's the key thing to remember.  In 1972, Richard Nixon carried 49 states.  He got 60.7 percent of the vote, the highest number, higher than Reagan in '84, highest number since World War II, and a year-and-a-half later, he was out of office.The American people are about to have a candidate who is clearly going to be under criminal investigation for the entire first and second year of her presidency, if she can even survive it because what Wikileaks has really done is it has...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  I don't want to interrupt you.  As you talk about Wikileaks, let me put up relevant -- we'll put you on half the screen.  We'll keep your beautiful face up.  And on the other half of the screen, Wikileaks revelations specific to the server.  I'm sorry.GINGRICH:  No, no, I love hanging out with you because as you're explaining you really don't want to interrupt me, you're interrupting me.  And everybody who knows the two of us by now knows that, you know, we've known each other a long time.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY:  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.GINGRICH:  But here's the core point.  And Andy McCarthy, who is one of the-- was the prosecutor for the 1993 World Trade Center bombings, is one of the leading experts on terrorism in America.He has a column coming out in the morning where he points out this is a classic example of RICO.  RICO is the statute for going after organized crime, and he walks you through in his column in the morning, every single standard by which the FBI decides whether or not they're dealing with a conspiracy to commit organized crime.And by every single standard that you would apply to the Mafia or the Mexican drug cartel or any other group, the Clinton family business is, in fact, a corporation engaged in organized crime.They violated the law by misusing the office of secretary of state.  They have violated the law by trading on -- on -- to get money in ways that were totally violative of being a nonprofit.I suspect the IRS will be forced to revoke their entire nonprofit status, which will mean all of their donors have to pay taxes on what they thought was a tax-deductible contribution.HANNITY:  Look at the Russian uranium deal for one, all the people that made money.  Look at that Haitian deal!  Look at the Moroccan deal.  I mean, look at the AP pointing out that 55 percent of the individuals that had access to then secretary of state Hillary Clinton are all donors or all people that pledged.  You pay money, you get -- they had the separate list after the Haiti earthquake, friends of Bill, Clinton Foundation donors so they could cash in on the contacts from the money that they raised to help the people so that they can then kick more money back to the Clinton Foundation.  I mean, this is outrageous!GINGRICH:  If you go back and -- Well, you go back and look at how many people Rudy Giuliani put in jail when he was the U.S. attorney in New York City and you ask Rudy if he could prepare this case with the full power of the federal government, how confident would he be that he would get multiple convictions.  And I think he'll tell you that he would go to any jury in the country...HANNITY:  He said I'd be in jail.GINGRICH:  ... and it would be virtually impossible...HANNITY:  Before you came on, he said I'd be in jail.I won't play it again, but look at what Trey -- let's go back to FBI Director Comey.  And he gives a 15-minute statement.  For 13 of the 15 minutes I'm sitting there like everybody else, saying, Oh, my word, if you will, he's going to pull the trigger.  And then he backs off at the last minute.Then he gets grilled by Trey Gowdy.  Trey Gowdy gets him to admit that, in fact, she lied when he said she never sent or received classified information on her private e-mail.  He got her (sic) to say that what she said was not true.  Gowdy asked if there was nothing marked classified on her e-mails -- was that true when she said that?  Comey's words, ""That's not true,"" and then a series of six other things.  So how...GINGRICH:  Look, anybody who destroyed government information by using BleachBit, which is an expensive, sophisticated design, in order to block anybody, even the FBI or the National Security Agency from being able to figure out what was on the computer -- that is on the face of it a crime in a situation where they have taken information from the U.S. government and they have now destroyed it.Now, just by itself, that's clearly a crime.  You cannot make any reasonable argument that Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton are not engaged in a series of crimes which for anybody else would blow up.  And of course, what's now happened -- and you asked me earlier what I think.  You know, the truth is -- as you point out, I just have a new novel out.  If I were a novelist and I tried to write...HANNITY:  No one would believe it.GINGRICH:  ... that the case was almost stopped, and then -- then Anthony Weiner's sex problems with a 15-year-old in North Carolina gets the FBI to look at Anthony Weiner's material, and they discover looking at his material that his wife, Huma Abedin, has thousands and thousands of e- mails...HANNITY:  I'm not sure I believe it.GINGRICH:  ... which I suspect -- oh, I do.  I think it was comingled on the home computer.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  That's a strong possibility, and that's what's being reported. But I also think there's a Wikileaks component here, and I think that James Comey realized this was going to be the single most embarrassing scandal in the history not only of the FBI but electoral politics, and he used that opportunity to reopen it to save face because he probably realizes what Wikileaks has is devastating to his decision-making.  Right or wrong?GINGRICH:  I think that's right, and I think all of us should join John Podesta in demanding that the FBI release everything by Monday.Why shouldn't the American people see all of these e-mails?  HANNITY:  Every one.  Every one, absolutely.  GINGRICH:  Hillary has assured us none of them involved secrets, so let's take her at her word.  None of them involved secrets.  They should release every single e-mail by Monday.  HANNITY:  I want to get to this other issue with Terry McAuliffe and money raised by Hillary and the PAC that went to Andrew McCabe's wife who is running for Congress, and he's the guy that was running the investigation. Unbelievable.  We'll have more with Newt Gingrich after the break.  Also, Judge Jeanine Pirro, Doug Schoen, Jay Sekulow, and much more on this busy news night. Tonight, the presidential election hangs in the balance, 11 day to go.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  In very brief remarks tonight, Hillary Clinton tried to politicize this investigation by attacking and falsely accusing the FBI director of only sending the letter to Republicans.  Another Clinton lie.  As it turned out, the letter was sent to both Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress.  The FBI would never have reopened this case at this time unless it were a most egregious criminal offense.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Donald Trump reacting to today's big breaking news, some October surprise, I guess, but the FBI now reopening its probe into Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server.  It's not the only problem for the Democratic nominee this week.  On Monday we learned that Obama premiums are going to be skyrocketing next year by double digits in every state.  And WikiLeaks, they continue to release damning e-mails allegedly from the inbox of Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta.  With 11 days to go in the race, how badly is this going to hurt Clinton at the polls.  Back with us, former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.  I do think there's a lot to absorb here.  I've been telling you this now for a couple of weeks especially as it relates to WikiLeaks.  And we keep putting up on the screen and giving you only half the screen, you deserve the whole screen, but to show the public all that we're discovering that nobody else is reporting on.  Let me go to one specific issue here.  That is Andrew McCabe, promoted to FBI deputy director, supervised the investigation into the Clinton e-mail server scandal not long after Governor Terry McAuliffe, close, close ally, Clinton sycophant, governor of Virginia, of the commonwealth.  He had a PAC, Common Good, contributed, according to reports, up to as much as $675,000 for a long shot congressional shot of Mr. McCabe's wife Jill.  And it's also reported that Hillary raised money for the PAC.  It's almost like Hillary is giving her the money.  This is the wife of the FBI deputy director that's investigating this?  There's something -- that in and of itself --GINGRICH:  Look.  HANNITY:  Go ahead.  GINGRICH:  You have John Podesta going to dinner -- we still don't have the full list, with various Justice Department figures.  As you pointed out in the last segment, you have Bill Clinton meeting in a private secret meeting with the attorney general on an airplane in Arizona the week his wife is supposed to be interrogated.  McCabe at a minimum should have recused himself from anything that had to do with Hillary Clinton.  I mean, you can't quite decide whether Washington is just now so decayed that people have lost all sense of right and wrong and all sense of how to do things properly, or whether in fact it's straight out corruption.  I mean you really don't know which is going on in some of these cases.  But it's clear when you add all of the pieces together that any realistic, honest assessment is that there's a cesspool of corruption that involves lots of people getting lots of money.  Remember, you look at the amount of money Raytheon made out of several of the lobbyists who raised lots of money for Hillary and Hillary intervened as secretary of state to help Raytheon get billions of dollars in contracts.  You look at the amount of money involved in the Russian uranium deal.  We're talking here about the stuff of novels and movies, except it's real.  And I think that as it keeps coming out, and I agree with you, by the way. I think WikiLeaks will maybe in a year or two years, somebody will finally piece it all together and make sense of it.  It is such an enormous volume of insight into the sickness and corruption of the Clinton system that to really piece it all together would take more time than we're going to have between now and the election.  HANNITY:  Let me play Hillary Clinton's ever changing story on the issue of her server, because I think this is profound.  You can listen to her contradict herself left and right here.  Remember, she had 14 devices -- 13?  All right, 13 devices.  Judge Jeanine is next to me here.  Let me play the ever changing story.  (LAUGHTER)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  The laws and regulations in effect when I was secretary of state allowed me to use my e-mail for work. That is undisputed.  It clearly wasn't the best choice, and I take responsibility for that decision.  I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal e-mails instead of two.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  IPhone or Android?  (LAUGHTER)CLINTON:  IPhone.  OK, in full disclosure --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  BlackBerry.  CLINTON:  And a BlackBerry.  I have an iPad, a mini iPad, an iPhone, and a BlackBerry.  I believe I have met all of my responsibilities and the server will remain private.  In order to be as cooperative as possible, we have turned over the server.  They can do whatever they want to with the server.  I am confident that I never sent nor received any information that was classified at the time it was sent and received.          So that leaves the 100 out of 30,000 e-mails that Director Comey testified contained classified information.          I did not receive anything that was marked as classified.          Director Comey said that only three out of 30,000 had anything resembling classified markers.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Did you wipe the server?  CLINTON:  What, like with a cloth or something?  We turned over everything that was work related, every single thing.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  No, you BleachBit -- you acid washed it, number one.  But let's add a couple of other things, Mr. Speaker, in light of all of those contradictions, the many --GINGRICH:  Can I stop you just one second.  What's really striking, because I'm sitting here in Woodstock listening.  I'm really focused on what I'm hearing.  She -- it's not just that she lies.  She lies with an arrogance and a certainty that the greatest actors on Broadway would admire.  When you listen to the tone of her voice, you know she's lying, but she's lying with such arrogance and she's driving it so hard, and it doesn't matter what she's saying.  She has the same tone even as she's saying a lie about the lie she told earlier which was the lie she started with.  It's an astonishing personal trait.  HANNITY:  Remember Bill Safire, worked for the The New York Times, called her a congenital liar, and it was such an outrage.  Think of other things here.  And I've got to go, but the quid pro quo now takes on a whole new meaning.  Not understanding the ""c"" classification when there's no a, no b, no d, x, y, and z, takes on new meeting.  Bill Clinton meeting with Loretta Lynch on the plane takes on new meaning.  The collusion that WikiLeaks described between the campaign and the Justice Department, the campaign and the State Department and the White House and talking about destroys evidence because, oops, Barack Obama lied and got caught and they've got to clean it up.  This is so deep --GINGRICH:  I know --HANNITY:  Yes.  GINGRICH:  I know we're about to run out of time.  I told you folks, I want to bring four young people out here for a very specific reason.  These are just good Georgians.  I want everybody watching tonight to understand, this is about them.  You got to get closer.  This is about them.  HANNITY:  Get close to uncle Newt.  Give uncle Newt a hug.  GINGRICH:  He's saying give uncle Newt a hug.  Ignore him.  (LAUGHTER)GINGRICH:  But my point, Sean, is, and you've got kids, and you understand this.  HANNITY:  I do.  GINGRICH:  We forget, this is about whether our children and our grandchildren live in a lawless country like Venezuela where the powerful rip off everybody and lie about it, or whether we reestablish for these folks the rule of law so that they can grow up in a country called America where once again everyone is equal under the law.  HANNITY:  Their parents for 11 days have an opportunity to take their country back.  Let's see what they do.  Mr. Speaker, to you and those four great kids, it's all about them.  Thank you for being with us.  When we come back on this busy news night, we'll have more reaction with our panel, Judge Jeanine Pirro, Doug Schoen, Jay Sekulow, all here, and more breaking news on the special edition of ""Hannity"" straight ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  I have great respect for the FBI for righting this wrong.  The American people fully understand her corruption, and we hope all, all justice will finally be served.  (APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Donald Trump campaigning -- I was talking to Doug Schoen -- earlier today in Maine where he praised the FBI for reopening its criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton after new e-mails were discovered during the bureau's sexting investigation into Huma Abedin's husband Weiner.  Joining us now with reaction, the chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, Fox News contributor Doug Schoen, the host of ""Justice with Judge Jeanine,"" Judge Jeanine Pirro.  Judge, you've got a lot to say. Why are you laughing?  JUDGE JEANINE PIRRO, ""JUSTICE"" HOST:  I'll tell you.  I can't believe for one minute, Sean, that this is about something they found in the investigation of this pedophile Huma Abedin's husband.  I think it's deeper than this.  I think there's more than this that's involved, because for Jim Comey to come out 11 days before a presidential election, and understand --HANNITY:  It's got to be big.  PIRRO:  It's got to be big.  Now, big in the sense that they could arrest her, they could indict her, they could send her to jail, they already had that.  But the FBI has already destroyed the evidence.  They've given everyone immunity.  They've basically said, oh, forget about it, it's no big deal.  They had her by the short hairs.HANNITY:  Why is it -- because of WikiLeaks.  By the way, I misspoke. Gateway Pundit had reported via Russia today, a reporter in London reported that Julian Assange would release e-mails that could provide enough evidence to get her arrested.  WikiLeaks is watching.  They actually called and told us, no, that was from some time ago and that's not true.  So I apologize.  Want to make sure we get everything right.  Jay Sekulow, from the legal side, you and I have discussed at length in detail the crimes that we know were committed here.  We were both shocked at what Jim Comey did.  Why is he reopening it?  Is it in part because of WikiLeaks, and are they not telling us, are they using the Huma Abedin- Weiner e-mails to obfuscate what is an opportunity, they have been shown up by WikiLeaks in a lot of ways and probably fear that they may be embarrassed further?  JAY SEKULOW, CHIEF COUNSEL, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE:  I've said from the beginning that the investigation by the FBI and the Hillary Clinton email scandal was a full investigation, a fake investigation. Obviously that's the case, because whether it's WikiLeaks, which it well could be, or whether it's information from Huma Abedin -- ask yourself this question.  How did the FBI not ask for and demand Huma Abedin's personal e- mail accounts as well as her --HANNITY:  How did they agree to destroy evidence of other people.  Who destroys evidence in a case?  SEKULOW:  By the way, that is called obstruction of justice if anybody else did it.  Sean, here is what needs to happen.  Tonight, a grand jury needs to be impaneled, number one.  Number two, a special prosecutor needs to be appointed immediately.  Number three, James Comey, Loretta Lynch, and deputy director of the FBI McCabe need to not be involved in this process. A lot of people are praising James Comey because he opened it up.  Let's cut the nonsense.  This whole thing is ridiculous.  And I'll tell you something.  You know this, Sean.  I've been critical when I thought Donald Trump was off point and off message, but this goes beyond politics.  Doug will address that.  This goes to the heart of our constitutional republic.  And you don't do this in the United States of America.  So if they reopened it, whether it's WikiLeaks, whether it's Huma Abedin, it has to be really significant.  And I think 11 days out, even though these FBI directors are saying we're just looking at it, for them to do this, it has to be big.  HANNITY:  Doug?DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Hillary is going to be elected.  She's been under criminal investigation by the FBI for the bulk of the campaign and, you know, she's had a steady lead.  It's a11 days out.HANNITY:  She may get elected.  But if crimes are committed, maybe before she gets into office she's going to be indicted.  May while she's in office she's going to be indicted.  What, does Barack Hussein Obama give her a pardon as he leaves office?  He could.  Does she give herself a pardon?  SCHOEN:  All of that could happen.HANNITY:  Really?  Is that what you want for your country?  SCHOEN:  I want her elected.HANNITY:  Wait a minute.  PIRRO:  Don't waste your time.  She's not going to get elected.  SCHOEN:  Yes, she is.   PIRRO:  The independents right now are going to say I have Clinton fatigue. I am so sick and tired of all of these scandals.  With the Clintons, whenever they go, there is dirt.  They're a cesspool of corruptibles.  HANNITY:  Let me ask you this.  Trey Gowdy got James Comey to admit crimes before his committee.  SCHOEN:  It didn't affect the polls.  HANNITY:  We've got collusion WikiLeaks revealed between the campaign of Hillary, the Justice Department, the State Department, and the White House.  PIRRO:  That is why I say --HANNITY:  And the president lied, too.  PIRRO:  There is more to this.  The FBI --(CROSSTALK)PIRRO:  You know what, if you don't this, we are going to revolt.  This is a case that demands a grand jury, a subpoena --(CROSSTALK)SCHOEN:  We're not going to get a grand jury.  We're not.  SEKULOW:  I think we're on the precipice of a constitutional crisis if a grand jury is not empaneled and this is not handled correctly within our judicial system.  We are --    HANNITY:  I agree with you.  What did you think, Jay, of Comey?  Remember, we watched Comey, 13 of the 15 minutes, I'm saying oh, my.  He's going to pull the trigger, he's going to go forward with a recommendation --SEKULOW:  Yes.  HANNITY:  -- to the Justice Department to indict her.  He pulls back at the end.  SEKULOW:  Yes.  HANNITY:  Then he gets nailed by Trey Gowdy in committee and Trey Gowdy gets him to admit, yes, she committed a number of crimes and lied a number of times.  Now we find out even more about all of this.  And then we've got Terry McAuliffe, gets money from Hillary, raises for her PAC, gives to the guy that is in charge of the investigation.  This is not a banana republic, Jay.  We are constitutional republic.  The rule of law should matter. There shouldn't be two sets of laws for everybody watching this show and Hillary Clinton.  And that is what it seems to be.  SEKULOW:  So Ben Franklin famously said ""It's a constitution republic, madam, if you can keep it,"" when he was asked what kind of government we have.  The question that I think the American public is asking themselves tonight is, are we going to be a constitutional republic?  Because at the end of the day, Sean, what James Comey did today by reopening it --  HANNITY:  Did he do it to save his own ass and reputation?(CROSSTALK)PIRRO:  This is Comey standing up and saying I am here as a champion of justice.  (CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  WikiLeaks was going to expose the fraud.  SCHOEN:  He has to explain.  He owes it to us to explain.HANNITY:  Why not have a special prosecutor?  SCHOEN:  I would be against it now until he explains what he is doing.  PIRRO:  He can't.  HANNITY:  He can't --(CROSSTALK)SCHOEN:  A special prosecutor to look at the FBI.  It's outrageous.HANNITY:  Programming note, Judge Jeanine, Saturday night, Sunday night, 9:00 p.m., ""Justice with Judge Jeanine.""  Don't miss it.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  That is all the time we have left.  A few other questions.  Is the FBI going to look into the truthfulness if Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI?  Did new evidence reveal this?  By the way, is Weiner maybe an FBI witness?  Will Hillary promise not to pardon her top aide to the Clinton Foundation?  Will Hillary Rodham Clinton agree that in the event she's indicted she'll resign if she ever won?  We'll see you Monday.  Have a great weekend.  We'll see you, eight days to go.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Chris Wallace.  The U.S. and Iran exchanged prisoners, as a landmark nuclear deal takes effect.  And with just two weeks until the Iowa caucuses, Ted Cruz takes the gloves off against Donald Trump.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.  But the poll numbers have.  DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  There's a big question mark on your head, and you can't do that to the party.  WALLACE:  Cruz defending his eligibility to be president, and attacking Trump's so-called New York values.  CRUZ:  Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.  I'm just saying.  TRUMP:  When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.  WALLACE:  Today, Ted Cruz is one on one, only on ""Fox News Sunday.""Then --REP. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  I think he's been the most polarizing president we've had in our lifetime.  WALLACE:  House Speaker Paul Ryan responds to President Obama's State of the Union speech, and lays out the GOP agenda for 2016.  It's a ""Fox News Sunday"" exclusive.  Plus, our Sunday panel on the Democratic presidential race, which has suddenly too close to call.  And our power player of the week, the man behind Donald Trump's campaign.What's it like managing Donald Trump?All, right now, on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  We begin with breaking news.  Three of the four Americans released by Iran have been flown out of the country in exchange for seven Iranians held by the U.S.  A fifth American was released separately.  At the same time, international sanctions by Iran have been lifted and billions in Iranian assets released as part of the landmark nuclear deal.   We'll get reaction from leading Republican candidate, Senator Ted Cruz, in a moment.But first, let's get the latest from chief intelligence correspondent, Catherine Herridge -- Catherine.CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, the prisoner swap is a culmination of 14 months of secret diplomacy, though the secretary of state says it was never tied to a successful nuclear deal.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE:  While the two tracks of negotiations were not directly related -- and they were not -- there is no question that the pace and the progress of the humanitarian talks accelerated in light of the relationships forged and the diplomatic channels unlocked over the course of the nuclear talks.(END VIDEO CLIP)HERRIDGE:  In addition to Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, who was arrested in 2014 and convicted of spying by a secret court, the freed Americans include Christian pastor Saeed Abedini, a U.S. Marine veteran Amir Hekmati, and Nosratollah Khosravi, though little is known about his case.  After the news broke, Abedini's wife spoke cautiously about the family's relief.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NAGHMEH ABEDINI, WIFE OF SAEED ABEDNI:  It just seems surreal.  It came at a time I was not expecting.  It just seem real until be see him, but I know it's real.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HERRIDGE:  The prisoner exchange came just before economic sanctions on Iran were lifted, under the terms of the nuclear deal struck last summer, freeing of tens of billions of frozen assets, and opening global markets to Iran's massive oil and gas reserves.  A congressional source briefed on the intelligence says Iran is still holding at least three Americans, some of the names are not public, adding the regime has not turned the page on its use of hostages as bargaining chips -- Chris.  WALLACE:  Catherine, thank you.Joining me now here in Washington is Senator Ted Cruz.  And, Senator, welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday.""CRUZ:  Chris, good to be with you.  WALLACE:  Let's start with the breaking news.  Iran, as we just reported, has released those four Americans, at least three of them have cleared Iranian airspace and the Iran nuclear deal went into effect, which means the U.S. and other Western countries have started lifting sanctions releasing billions of dollars to Iran.  What's your reaction to both?  CRUZ:  Well, listen, praise God that the prisoners are coming home, that the Americans are coming home.  You know, in particular, millions of believers across the world have been lifting up Pastor Saeed Abedini in prayer and speaking out for his case.  And so, we celebrate their coming home, Jason Rezaian, Amir Hekmati, the fourth individual.  We celebrate all of them coming home.I spoke yesterday briefly to Naghmeh, Pastor Saeed's wife, who I've gotten to know very well, and we're all very grateful he's coming.  But at the same time, this deal is a problematic deal, and it reflects a pattern we have seen in the Obama administration over and over again of negotiating with terrorists, and making deals and trades that endanger U.S. safety and security.  This deal has a lot of deals in common with the Bowe Bergdahl deal, where in exchange for Bowe Bergdahl -- someone now facing court-martial -- we released five senior Taliban terrorists.  And this instance, this deal to bring back Americans who were wrongly imprisoned, we release seven terrorists who helped Iran with their nuclear program and we agreed not to prosecute another 14 terrorists for doing the same thing.  That's 21 terrorists helping Iran develop nuclear weapons that they intend to use to try to murder us.  And I think it's a very dangerous precedent.  The result of this, every bad actor on earth has been told go capture an American.  If you want terrorists out of the jail, capture an American and President Obama is in the let's make a deal business.  That's a really dangerous precedent.  WALLACE:  It wasn't the only deal we had with Iran.  Iran's Revolutionary Guard seized 10 U.S. Navy sailors, and released this video showing those sailors on their knees.  Here was your reaction at the first debate.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ:  I give you my word, if I'm elected president, no serviceman or woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men and women will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Now, Senator, I think it's fair to say, all Americans were outraged to see that video of Americans on their knees.  On the other hand, the Iranians did release the sailors in 14 hours.  You still would release what you call the full force and fury of the U.S. military against Iran for that incident?  CRUZ:  Let's be clear: any nation that captures or military officers, captures or soldiers should face serious repercussions.  And the reason Iran felt free to do that, to seize those ships and to humiliate those soldiers --WALLACE:  But in this particular case, what would you have done?  I mean, they were -- I'm not saying it was right, but they were released in 14 hours.  You still would have taken action?CRUZ:  They were released in 14 hours, but the only reason they were seized is because of the weakness of Barack Obama.  The Obama/Clinton foreign policy leading from behind, our enemies are laughing at us.  The days after seizing our sailors and parading them on television to humiliate them, look those images were propaganda from Khamenei.  Within hours for that, John Kerry and President Obama were profusely thanking Khamenei for letting our sailors go after they wrongly captured them and try to humiliate them and now, they're trying to send $150 billion to Khamenei?  It is the direct result of the weakness of this presidency.  But there is good news -- which is the fastest thing that can change with a new president is foreign policy.  It's worth remember, the same nation Iran in 1981 released our hostages the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office.  WALLACE:  But threatening full force and fury is not the first time that you've used very sharp military rhetoric which has been controversial.  Here's how you said you would handle another threat.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ:  We will have a president who will make clear we will utterly destroy ISIS.  We will carpet-bomb them into oblivion.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  But, Senator, carpet-bombing against ISIS would never work.  ISIS is embedded in civilian populations in major cities.  And if I may, I want to put up this statement here by Bob Scales.  He's one of the leading U.S. military -- former head of the Army War College.He said, ""Carpet bombing, that's just another one of those phrases that people with no military experience throw around.""CRUZ:  Well, look, I will apologize to no one, with how vigorous I will be winning the war on terror, defeating radical Islamic terrorism.  We will start by having a president willing to acknowledge our enemy, say it by its name, which President Obama and Hillary Clinton refuse to do.And you want to know what carpet bombing means?  Yesterday was the 25th anniversary of the beginning of Desert Storm.  In 1991, we had roughly 8,000 planes.  Today, we have 4,000.  Our Air Force has dropped in half.  In 1991, we have 529 ships in our Navy.  Today, we have 272.  It's dropped nearly in half.  In 1991, we had over a third more soldiers in our army, and we were launching 1,100 air attacks a day.  We were carpet bombing them.  And after 37 days of 1,100 air attacks a day, on troops went in in a day and a half and mopped up the remnants of the Iraqi army because that's the effect of carpet bombing.You know what we're doing now?  We're doing between 15 and 30 air attacks.  WALLACE:  There's a big difference.  First of all, military people will tell you we didn't carpet bomb in Kuwait, in the Gulf War, that we did precision striking.  In addition, if I may, the Iraqi army was all massed by itself in the Kuwaiti desert.  We're now talking about ISIS soldiers who are not massed.  They were embedded in Mosul.  They were embedded in Raqqa with civilians.  But if I may, sir, let me move on to --CRUZ:  Hold on.  If you're going to make a respond, let me respond.  WALLACE:  OK.  But go ahead.  I would like to ask about some of your votes, though, and not the rhetoric.  CRUZ:   If you're going to make a point, let me respond to it.  WALLACE:  Go ahead, sir.  CRUZ: Which is, right now, our rules of engagement, what we're seeing, 15, 20 attacks a day.  It's photo-op foreign policy.  So, we're not taking out the oil fields.  We're not taking out, for example, we saw a recent report about jihadist university, where they're training jihadists.  Why isn't that building rubble?  We're not using overwhelming airpower.You know, in 1991, we had 2,000 planes there launching this air attack.  We have about 200 right now fighting against ISIS.  And the difference is we do not have directed concentrated effort, because this president pretends like this enemy doesn't exist, like these are isolated lone wolves.  He gives the State of the Union that is a state of the denial, where he says, gosh, you know, ISIS is a bunch of guys in pickup trucks.No, they are a serious terrorist force that has declared war on us.  We can defeat them, but can't defeat them if the president is unwilling to do so.  And as president, I will defeat ISIS.  I will utterly destroy them, and it takes a commander in chief directing our forces to do that.  WALLACE:  Let's talk about your report on the Senate.You have voted three -- the last three years in a row against the Defense Authorization Act.  And while you attack President Obama for failing to observe the red line and go after Assad for the use of is it chemical weapons, in fact, back in 2013, you opposed giving the president that authority.  CRUZ:  So you have two questions there.  You want to talk about the NDA or Syria?  WALLACE:  I think they are both of a pattern, sir.CRUZ:  No -- well, let's talk about them one at a time.  In Syria, my view of foreign policy, is every use -- every aspect of foreign policy, every use of military power should be directed to the vital national security interests of America.  The problem with Syria, when President Obama wanted to engage an attack, a unilateral attack against Assad, I kept an open mind at first.  I said, all right, let's here the commander in chief tell us how this advances our vital national security.  President Obama was unable to do so.  They vacillated between points of incoherence.  At one point, John Kerry said the objective was to launch a, quote, ""unbelievably small attack"", essentially more photo-op foreign policy of press release.  That doesn't make any sense.  The question I asked over and over again both in public hearings and in private hearings was if you succeed, if you topple Assad, how do we stop radical Islamist terrorists, how do we stop al Qaeda, or al Nusra or ISIS from taking over Syria?  WALLACE:  Sir, I want to interrupt, and I very respectfully, but I do want to cover some more ground.  So your answer is you didn't think it was effective?CRUZ:  It's not -- not ineffective.  It would have hurt or interests to give Syria to ISIS.  It hurts U.S. national security interests.  WALLACE:  But you supported -- you opposed giving him the authority to observe the red line.  CRUZ:  But why?  WALLACE:  But if I may -- well, what about the three times in a row that you voted against the Defense Authorization Act?  CRUZ:  That's an altogether separate issue.  WALLACE:  Ii understand.  CRUZ:  Well, you just said they were tied together.  So, you want to talk about Defense Authorization Act?  So I have voted against it, because when I campaigned for Senate, I promised the people of Texas I would not support a Defense Authorization Act that has within it language authorizing the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens on U.S. soil.  I have supported over and over again with each Defense Authorization Act on an amendment that Mike Lee and Dianne Feinstein have done together, that would say, if you arrest a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil, you're entitled to due process.  You're entitled to what the Constitution gives us and unfortunately the Senate keeps blocking that amendment.  WALLACE:  And you're saying that protecting an American who is accused of aiding terrorism is more important than authorizing the use of the military of the United States?  CRUZ:  Honoring a promise I made to the men and women who elected me is my first obligation.  It's what I've done every day in the Senate, is do what I said I would do.  Now, listen --WALLACE:  And that's more important than authorizing money for the military?  CRUZ:  By the way, Chris -- by the way, the Defense Authorization Act, I'm on the Senate Armed Committee, each Defense Authorization Act, I have introduced amendments adopted into that bill.  I have worked actively on the Defense Authorization Act.  I would like to support it at the end if they would add the protection for the civil rights of Americans, I would support it in a heartbeat.And I would note, in fact, one amendment I introduced to the NDA that passed into law was in December a year ago.  It was an amendment mandating that the soldiers murdered at Ft. Hood by Nidal Hassan would receive the Purple Heart.  And the Obama Pentagon fought tooth and nail against me, yet I was proud to get the support of both Democrats and Republicans.  We passed that legislation over a year ago.  Last April I was in Ft. Hood when the Purple Hearts were rewarded, and to each of those soldiers and their families, I simply said, thank you for service and sacrifice, and I'm sorry it took over five years for your country to acknowledge that you were fighting terrorists.WALLACE:  Senator, you have taken some real hits for your attacks on Donald Trump and the so-called ""New York values"".  I happen to have, I don't know if you've had a chance to see them, because you've been on the campaign trail.  Here is ""The New York Post.""  They says Cruz missiles and they quote Rudy Giuliani as saying that he thought that New York had gotten over or rather the country had gotten over this knee-jerk reaction against New York.  They accuse you of a sneering apology.  Here is The New York Daily News, ""Slime doesn't pay, Ted.""Your reaction?  CRUZ:  Well, look, these are certainly amusing, and it is amusing saying the media elite in New York and D.C. run around with their hair on fire wondering what on earth are New York values?  I'll tell you and the rest of the country, people understand exactly what that is.  In South Carolina when I was there, the people there certainly understand it.  And you know what is particular --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  -- 9/11 part of New York values?CRUZ:  You know what is particularly curious, Chris?  Is that formulation didn't come from me.  It came from Donald Trump.  Donald Trump, when he was being interviewed by Tim Russert, when he was explaining his views a number of years ago.  WALLACE:  1999.  CRUZ:  He explained in his views that he was pro-choice, he supported partial birth abortion, open to gay marriage, and his explanation for all that, he said, I'm a New Yorker, I'm from Manhattan.  Those are the views of New York.  Those are what New York values are, they're not Iowa values, but that's New York values.  So, that was Donald's over explanation of what New York values are.  It's how he articulated it.  It strikes me as curious now that he is displayed such outrage that anyone would even acknowledge that there's a particular political view -- and I would point out it's a view echoed by far left liberal Democratic politicians like Andrew Cuomo, Bill de Blasio, Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump has supported those candidates and supported their positions on a lot of issues.  WALLACE:  One final question, and as I say we're just running out of time, you condemn the Washington cartel, which you call the lobbyists and career politicians who rig the game.  I want to ask you about one of your recent acts as a senator.  You voted last month not to add money for the crop insurance program, but then you switched your vote and decided to add the money three minutes later.  Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Mr. Cruz, no.  Mr. Cruz, aye.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Senator, isn't that exactly the kind of game that the Washington cartel plays?  CRUZ:  You know, Chris, I appreciate you passing on other campaign's oppo hits, but that one is based on a factual mistake.  In that instance, they have flipped the order of votes.  And so, I went up initially voting one way, believing we were voting on cloture on the issue, on the Export/Import Bank, and when I voted that way, Pat Roberts made a comment about crop insurance, and I was puzzled, because what I had believed I was voting on concerns the Import/Export Bank, not crop insurance.  And I went back to the team and said what went wrong?  And the team apologized and said they switched the vote.  WALLACE:  Pat Roberts, we should point out is a senator from Kansas, very highly respected, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, says that's not the way it happened, he came up and tried to get you to change your vote, and explains and specifically said this will hurt you in Iowa.  That's what he says.CRUZ:  Pat said it was about crop insurance and I was completely puzzled, because my staff briefing had said the order of votes -- and you often have a bunch of votes in the Senate and they change the votes sometimes.  And so, my staff had gotten it wrong, they briefed me on the wrong report.  I said, wait a second, I didn't know I was voting on crop insurance, and the vote is open for 15 minutes, so I went back and asked, all right, what exactly is this?  Oh, it's crop insurance.WALLACE:  But you're saying you didn't change your mind?  CRUZ:  I didn't change my mind.  And we said that immediately.  This is one of the sort of political games people play, where we said immediately, look, it was a mistake on our part, we understood the order of the votes.  And when we realized it, we corrected it and voted the way I always intended to.  WALLACE:  Senator Cruz, thank you.  Thanks for your time.  CRUZ:  Thank you, Chris.WALLACE:  We're going to be out in Iowa.  I hope to see you on the campaign trail.  And I hope to have some more time so we can talk about more subjects, sir.  CRUZ:  I look forward to it.  WALLACE:  Thank you.Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss Iran's release of those American prisoners, just as the West starts to implement that landmark nuclear deal.  Plus, what do you think?  Is the deal with Iran good or bad fro the U.S. and how much can we trust Iran?  Let me know on Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and use the #fns.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KERRY:  The United States, our friends and allies in the Middle East, in the entire world are safer because the threat of a nuclear weapon has been reduced.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Secretary of State Kerry announcing implementation of the nuclear deal with Iran, the same day the two countries agreed to a prisoner swap.And it's time now for our Sunday group: syndicated columnist George Will, Carol Lee, who covers the White House for The Wall Street Journal, GOP strategist Karl Rove, and Charles Lane from The Washington Post.Karl, what do you make of the release of these four American prisoners, hostages, whatever you want to call them, just as the U.S. starts lifting sanctions against Iran?  KARL ROVE, GOP STRATEGIST:  Well, I think it's a good thing they were released.  We paid a high price, seven people have to be pardoned, 14 people have to be not prosecuted, but Americans are coming home.  This, frankly, though, it's obscuring a bigger issue, and that is Secretary of State Kerry said today marks the first day of a safer world.  Why should we believe that?  The Iranians have not lived up to a single agreement that they've made.  They've tested since this agreement was arrived at, ballistic missiles in apparent violation of it.  They took our sailors out in violation of their international agreements, paraded them for propaganda purposes.  And even on the eve of the secretary's statements, he and the Iranian foreign minister were engaged in a debate about the nature of the centrifuges that Iran under the agreement is allowed to develop within a decade that could allow them to develop a nuclear weapon.We're already arguing about whether they can go as far as they think they can go.  So, this is not a safer world.  It's the first day of a very long, bad period in which the Iranians will take this deal and run with it.  WALLACE:  Carol, I want to ask you about what Senator Cruz said and also some of the other Republican candidates, which is basically we traded terrorists, Iranian terrorists -- he said I'm not sure they're terrorists, but certainly bad actors on Iran's part, some of them convicted for crimes for violating the sanctions for four American hostages.  At the White House, which you cover, is there some sensitivity to that issue?  CAROL LEE, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Well, their argument is that this -- they needed to show an act of good faith to get the Americans home, and they had a list of Iranians that were held in the U.S. that Iran gave to them, and they chose these seven basically because they were not charged with terrorism or any sort of violence.  It was violations with the sanctions.  I think the question now particularly for this president going forward with the year left is where this relationship goes from here.  You've had three successes the White House has viewed this week for diplomacy, the release for the sailors quickly, the Iran nuclear deal being implemented and now the release of these Americans, the relationship is really going to be tested in two ways going forward.  First will be this negotiations that they're having to end the conflict in Syria, which Iran is involved in.  And second, what Iran does with this roughly $100 billion of money, and how much mischief they make in the world.  WALLACE:  Yes.  George, let me pick up on that because I think it's fair to say that relations between the U.S. and Iran already complicated are going to grow even more complicated when you saw that this week.  We got the release of those ten U.S. sailors, first they were seized, then they were released.  Western sanctions against Iran have been lifted, and now we've had the release of the four American hostages.  What do you make of this relationship?  GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST:  Well, there's a temptation to always see a pattern in a flurry of events, which is why it's good to remember the post hoc propter hoc fallacy, the rooster crows and sun rises, therefore the crowing of the rooster caused the sun to rise.I'm not sure how these things are related.  Clearly, there seems to be some relationship, but then you go back a week and people say, well, it was really clever of the Iranians to seize that ship -- we don't know whether the ship had engine trouble, we don't know it's a navigation error, we don't know whether it was a bad decision to send, we don't know how it got there in the first place.Mr. Kerry has decided to construe this as proof that relationships developed while negotiating the nuclear accord are paying off.  We shall see.  He also says this proves the power of diplomacy.  Well, diplomacy will always work in the sense if it will reach an agreement, if there's an asymmetry of desire.  If one side is really eager to get to the end, you'll get to the end.Finally, there's a temptation here, and there's an echo of a cold war that we're trying to maneuver between the hawks and the doves in the Kremlin during the Cold War, and now the hawks and doves in Tehran.  I don't know.  The supreme leader is supreme, he's not immortal.  So, we're going to see regime change of some sort in Iran, and until then it remains very opaque.  WALLACE:  Well, and regime change -- it doesn't necessarily mean regime change, just because you replace one supreme leader with another, you still have a theocracy.  WILL:  But when you have a regime dominated as it is by one man, when you change the leader, you change the nature of the regime.  WALLACE:  Chuck, is the kind of a rollercoaster we are going to have to expect with Iran, where there are some things that please us like the quick release of the sailors, like the release not so quick of these four hostages, but on the other hand, you know, they continue, as Karl says, to violate the agreement.  They've tested ballistic weapons, and in some ways, you know, we are as disturbed by their actions as ever.  CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST:  Yes, and I would add that the Iranians did something very clever in the midst of all of this, which is make a huge order for airplanes from Europe, the Airbus planes.  WALLACE:  They announced that yesterday.  LANE:  They're already working to divide U.S. interests from European interests with an eye on the future of any kind of sanctions that might be supposedly snapped back under this agreement.  Another group of people who are eyeing all of this with concern, of course, are the Sunni Arab states -- Saudi Arabia, the Gulf Arabs, and Turkey, which isn't Arab, it is Sunni, who see -- who have seen all along in this rapprochement between the U.S. and Iran, a threat to the region and source of instability.  All the mischief that Iran is up to, Karl mentioned the ballistic missiles, but those countries I just mentioned are worried about things like the Houthis in Yemen and the disturbances along the Shiite regions of Saudi Arabia.  All that mischief is still to be worked out.  John Kerry would argue say the deal on nukes makes all that more manageable.  I don't think the Saudis would agree.WALLACE:  And Iran is going to have another $150 billion in its coffer if it wants to use it, and some people are saying, well, instead of using it to help the people of their country, they're going to end up using it to create more mischief.  And that's a nice word for it around the world.LANE:  The only good news on that score is the low oil price.  That makes this a relatively opportune move -- moment in the sense that Iran will not be able to get maximum revenues right away.  WALLACE:  All right.  We have to take a break here.  We'll see you all a little later.  Up next, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan on the GOP agenda heading into a big election year.  Plus, we'll ask him what was it like sitting behind President Obama during the State of the Union address?  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Coming up, with Donald Trump and Ted Cruz duking it out for the top spot --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.TRUMP: In the last three polls, I'm beating you.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: The establishment candidates are in a battle of their own. We'll ask our panel which of them has the advantage.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: A look outside the beltway of Baltimore's inner harbor, where House and Senate Republicans worked on their policy goals for 2016 at their annual retreat. New Speaker of the House Paul Ryan had a busy week, presiding over his first State of the Union, and then working on the GOP agenda for this year. We spoke with him Friday, just after the party retreat wrapped up.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: Mr. Speaker, welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday.""RYAN: Hey, thanks for having me. Good morning, Chris.WALLACE: You say that you want congressional Republicans to be the proposition party, not just the opposition party. I know that you're going to be addressing a number of topics this year, like the economy, like national security, but did you agree at all on an agenda, on any specific proposals at this retreat?RYAN: Yes, we did, actually. We agreed on five basic areas that we're going to be working on to build a very bold pro-growth agenda to take the country in 2016. Like you say, jobs, the economy, national security, poverty and upward mobility, restoring the Constitution, making sure that -- that we get government back to the separation of powers of our Constitution and replacing Obamacare with patient-centered health care and dealing with the entitlement reform issues so we don't have a debt crisis in this -- in this country.We got into a lot of specifics, but this is something that we're working from the bottom up. This is not going to be a top-down process. This is going to be a bottom-up process. Members of Congress and their represent -- and their people -- and their constituents forming this agenda. So it's way too soon to get into specifics. We're going to be rolling this out in the spring before we eventually have a nominee.WALLACE:  Now, there is reportedly a big difference in strategy between you and Senate Republican Leader McConnell. You want to pass specific legislation on tax reform, on replacing Obamacare. Leader McConnell supposedly want to protect his members who are seeking reelection from any tough votes. How did you revolve that or have you resolved it?RYAN: Well, this agenda is not going to be passed into law this year. Barack Obama is the president. So our goal here is not to simply just pass things and watch them go nowhere because we have a dis -- we have a White House that doesn't agree with us. Our goal here is to say, here is what we will do in 2017 if the country gives us the authority to do this. And we're going to need a new Republican president. This will not be an agenda you can pass with a -- with a liberal progressive as president. It's an agenda you can pass with a Republican president in 2017. And that's perfectly consistent with where the Senate Republicans are as well.WALLACE:  Let's talk a little bit about the current president. You asset behind President Obama during this week's State of the Union Address and your wife Jana reportedly told you that she didn't want to see you grimacing or shaking your head if you disagreed with something the president said.RYAN: Right.WALLACE:  You had to practice your poker face. Well, the speech is over, the poker face is over. What did you think of what the president had to say, and why did you say that you felt he had degraded the presidency in the speech?RYAN: I think he's very political. I think he erects what I call intellectual strawman arguments. He affixes views to people who don't agree with him that they do not have, only to try and win the debate in kind of an intellectually lazy way by just putting up strawman arguments. I think he's been the most polarizing president we've had in my lifetime and I think he tries to shift blame for his own mistakes on to other people.And I think it was a fairly partisan and political speech, quite frankly. I don't think he can help it. I think he's always in this sort of campaign mode. And I think he just sees the world as what he wishes it would be, not what it is, and -- and that makes for tunnel vision for a president.WALLACE:  Let's talk about a specific issues, ten Yemeni prisoners were transferred from Guantanamo By this week. And that now bringing the total at Gitmo to under 100. Last Sunday on this show, the White House chief of staff, Denis McDonough, said that if Congress doesn't close Gitmo, the president will. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DENIS MCDONOUGH, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: We will close Gitmo because it's bad for our national security and because it's too costly. That's what the president will do. He feels an obligation to his successor to close that and that's why we're going to do it.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Now, Congress has repeatedly barred the president from doing that --RYAN: (INAUDIBLE).WALLACE: But what if he goes ahead, which they certainly indicated, as you heard McDonough say, we're going to go do it.RYAN: Look, I watched you -- I watched that interview live last week and I did not have my poker face. I just kept shaking my head. You know, there they go again. I don't think they think like the Constitution matters anymore. That -- that the executive just can make it up as it goes.Look, the law is really clear. Even the attorney general -- the president's attorney general came to Congress and acknowledged the law is the law. The president can't do that. The president cannot send these prisoners to -- to the states. And so he can send whatever proposal he wants to us. The law is really -- oh, by the way, Chris, the law banning the transfer of Gitmo detainees to America was put into law by Democrats in Congress and has been in law ever since and recently signed into law as recently as December. So, look, he can send whatever he wants to Congress, but the law is the law. And -- and I'd be really amazed that the president is going to then try and direct or military to carry out orders where they knowingly are breaking the law. I can't imagine he would do that. he can send us whatever plan he wants. But this just goes -- this is just another chapter in the story of the president trying to make it up as he goes.WALLACE:  But -- but -- but, if I --RYAN: You know, eviscerate the limits placed upon him in the Constitution. And so, look, if he tries to break the law, he'll be called for trying to break the law.WALLACE: Well, OK. I mean that's the point, though, is that you and other Republican leaders said the same thing about Obamacare and some of the changes he made there. You say the same thing about the temporary amnesty for illegals.RYAN: Sure.WALLACE:  If he goes ahead and does it, can you stop him?RYAN: Look at detainees. There's two points I would make on that. Number one, are these guys going back on the battlefield? I mean shouldn't we be more worried about our national security than him keeping a 2008 campaign promise? Point number two, executive amnesty. We didn't -- we -- he was obviously doing something that we believe was unconstitutional, because it was. And so what did we do? We found the best way forward to prevent that from happening, which was our border state governors who had standing in courts went and sued the administration. And, guess what, he didn't get the executive amnesty. It's not happening because we were successful. So what we will do, whenever he does one of these actions, is take the best way forward we can -- we can come up with to get the best result, which is to stop him from doing it.WALLACE:  You keep talking about ""we,"" but there's obviously a serious split within the ranks of House Republicans. It's one of the reasons you're now speaker because Speaker Boehner, your predecessor, was forced out. And some of the more hardline conservatives are upset that you and some of the people before you, including Boehner, have raised the debt limit, have passed a budget and, in effect, lost your leverage. Which raises the question, when the budget runs out next September, are you prepared to really wield the power of the purse if -- if it means shutting down the government, shutting it down, to push your policies?RYAN: Well, what I think is more important -- what is most important is, we actually have an appropriations process that functions. What was really dysfunctional, and there are lots -- there's lots of blame to go around, was the fact that we piled up all of the appropriations, which is supposed to be broken up into 12 pieces, 12 bills, into one, big omnibus bill. I hate doing that. So that's why we're starting our budget process a month and a half ahead of time this year, having 12 separate bills, so that we don't have, as you described, some big shutdown moment. Twelve separate appropriation bills, regular order, the way the founders intended it, and the Senate's going to follow suit. So that's what 2016 is going to be about, which is, using the power of the purse more effectively, getting Congress to work the way it was supposed to be working in the first place, and that's why we're off to a really good start do you that.WALLACE:  South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley gave the official GOP response to President Obama this week. And in that response, she criticized Donald Trump. Rush Limbaugh and a lot of conservatives basically took off after you and said that there was an effort by the GOP establishment to stop Trump. Take a look at Haley and then Limbaugh.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. NIKKI HALEY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: During anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation.RUSH LIMBAUGH, ""THE RUSH LIMBAUGH SHOW"": Nikki Haley is the establishment, or the firewall, in South Carolina, where the establishment is going to put the brakes on and bring all this Trump stuff to a screeching halt.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Mr. Speaker, how do you plead?RYAN: Look, I read her speech the day before she gave it. It was a great speech. She wrote it, just like I wrote my own when I gave it in 2011. And when I read her speech, I wasn't thing anybody in particular. I wasn't thinking Donald Trump. I was thinking about, this is a good message to unify the conservative movement and therefore go to the country with a positive vision that unifies. Look, I think we win as conservatives if we unify. And I think that -- that was the -- the beauty of her message. And I wasn't thinking of any one particular individual when she gave that -- when she made that address.WALLACE:  Finally, you seem to have perfected your poker face for the State of the Union. I wonder, could you give that same look again? I'd like to see what the poker face looks like.RYAN: Geez. You know, it's really hard to do. But I just had to stare at the back of his head and just not -- look, I don't agree with the president on -- on pretty much anything. I'm a fairly expressive person. I'm an Irish guy. And that was really hard to do. And you can't ask me to do it on command. I'm just not that good at it.WALLACE:  Oh, come on, give us five seconds of the poker face.RYAN: I can't -- I really -- OK. There, how's that? Does that work for you?WALLACE:  Well, that was two seconds, but, anyway.And, briefly, how did your wife, Jana, --RYAN: (INAUDIBLE). Try doing it for an hour and 15 minutes for the first time. It was hard to do.WALLACE:  How did you wife Jana say you did?RYAN: She thought I passed the test.WALLACE:  Mr. Speaker, thank you. Safe travels.RYAN: You bet.WALLACE:  And we'll see you back here in Washington.RYAN: Thanks, Chris. Take care.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  Up next, the latest polls show Bernie Sanders is gaining on Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. Our Sunday group handicaps a coronation that's turning into a contest.Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the tightening Democratic race? Just go to FaceBook or Twitter @foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT., DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We need to have the courage in this country to bring forth a political revolution where millions of people stand up and say, enough is enough.HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He wants to roll Medicare, Medicaid, the children's health insurance program into a national system and then turn it over to the states to administer. Now, if -- if that's the kind of revolution he's talking about, I am worried, folks.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders sharpening their attacks ahead of tonight's Democratic debate, as the battle for the nomination has suddenly turned into a real contest. And we're back now with the panel.Well, as we say, the Democratic race is tightening across the country. Here is the latest Real Clear Politics average of recent polls. First, nationally, you can see Clinton now leads Sander by 8.5 points, down dramatically from just a month ago. In Iowa, Clinton's lead is now down to 4 points, down to 2 points in at least one poll. And in New Hampshire, Sanders continues to lead Clinton by more than six points.Carol, a month ago it seemed that Hillary Clinton was on her way pretty easily to the nomination. Question, what happened?LEE: Well, Bernie Sanders has -- there's a lot of enthusiasm on -- in -- among Democrats for something different. And he's really tapped into that. It's cutting into her -- her advantage. And, you know, it's coming down to basically a race between enthusiasm and organization. And the interesting thing about Bernie Sanders is that he has the enthusiasm some are comparing to what Barack Obama had in 2008, but it's unclear that he has the organization and that will be -- that remains to be seen in what happens in Iowa and in New Hampshire.WALLACE:  And in particular whether he has the organization after those --LEE: After those.WALLACE:  Those first two states.We asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on Facebook from Steve Norton. He writes, ""why do at the New York/D.C. experts say Bernie can't win? I say if he wins the first two states, the support and money will overtake Hillary. Because that is where the Democratic base really is.""Karl, how do you answer Steve?ROVE: Well, I'd say two things. One is, there are not enough Johnson County, Iowas, around the country and Keene, New Hampshires, around the country for --WALLACE:  And explain what they are.ROVE: These are very liberal bastions of very liberal Democrats. In Iowa, they turn out -- it's a college county, for example, in Iowa, it's a college town in New Hampshire. Look, Bernie Sanders is likely to win both of these. If you take a look at -- even in Iowa, where Hillary and the Real Clear Politics average lead by four points, she -- she -- if you -- there's one poll, which was done using automated telephone devices, it gave her a 21-point lead. You take that out, and all the polls in January average out to a 0.6 percent lead. And she's -- she was way ahead in -- in December. Eight of eight polls, led by 18 points on average in December. It's collapsed. And it's collapsing because, not just because he's got the excitement. It's because she's old and tired and she -- and he seems to be fresh and liberal. And the fact of the matter is, though, after you head south, it gets very tough for him because there are not a lot of liberal places as liberal as we find in New Hampshire and Iowa to sustain him. When you get to South Carolina or Nevada, you get a lot more African-Americans, a lot more Latinos, and a lot fewer liberal wackos.WALLACE:  Well, they're -- they're Americans, too, Karl.Then there is the Republican race, which increasingly seems to be a battle between two candidates, as we saw in the debate this week. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I'm not bringing a suit, I promise, but the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit. And you can't -- you have to have certainty.CRUZ: I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.TRUMP: You don't have to.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  George, have you wrapped your head around the idea that it is more likely than not that the Republican nominee is going to be either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz?WILL: I think it's a little too early to do that. The Republican dilemma, plainly put is, they can't win with Trump, they can't win without Trump supporters. So the big question mark hanging over the party right now is, will, and if so how much, will Donald Trump underperform his polls? Iowa doesn't have a great record of picking the Republican nominee and New Hampshire likes to go against Iowa. I think South Carolina is the place to look.Trey Gowdy, a very respected man -- I don't know much endorsements matter, but he has endorsed --WALLACE:  A member of Congress.WILL: A member of Congress. He has endorsed Rubio. Senator Tim Scott has not endorsed anyone yet, neither has Governor Haley. Chris Christie says it's not going to be -- come down to two in a hurry, it's going to come down to a final four in its own March Madness, just paralleling basketball. If what is going to happen, he thinks, is you'll have Trump and Cruz sustain for a while, you'll have, he thinks, Christie and Rubio sustain for a while. Then the governors will sort this out preferring Christie, because he is, A, a governor, he notes that four governors have endorsed so far, 24 haven't. And Christie says that will propel him.WALLACE:  I can just hear some of our viewers right now saying George Will remains in denial about what's going on here. I say that respectfully, but I'm sure that's what they're saying.WILL: I'm in denial.WALLACE:  Chuck, how do you see the Republican race?LANE: Well, the new development for me this week was the clashes between Cruz and Trump, who had previously treated each other with kid gloves. I think Cruz was surfing the Trump wave, so to speak. And they -- I think, on net, I would give the advantage to Cruz slightly because he was the first guy to flummox Donald Trump, leave him a little bit speechless in that exchange about the so-called birther issue. He is the first guy in this whole campaign to get under Trump's skin a little bit, to make him act defensively, to start attacking and so forth. And we see the first shade of vulnerability -- even though Trump did very well in that debate, the first shade of vulnerable in Trump, the first crack in his veneer. And if somebody -- and the others can continue to widen that, Trump may finally have this long awaited fizzle.WALLACE:  Karl, we've got about a minute left. There are, as George mentioned, there's four so-called establishment candidates all vying to be the one coming out of that lane. You can see them there, Rubio, Christie, Bush, Kasich. Of those four, who's got the advantage right now?ROVE: Well, if you look at the polls today in Iowa, Rubio is running third. If you look at the polls in New Hampshire --WALLACE:  Third behind Trump and Cruz.ROVE: Trump and Cruz. And I -- I believe that Trump leads modestly in the Real Clear Politics average, but I think Cruz is likely to win the state. In New Hampshire, it's a lot less clear. You have Rubio, Cruz and Kasich all with -- bunched, within 2.4 points of each other. And if you add Christie and Bush into it, in the Real Clear Politics average, they're all within 4.5 points. And given the nature of the average, that means it's a dead tie for third place in New Hampshire (INAUDIBLE).WALLACE:  So, you going to give us a name or not?ROVE: I -- I'm not because I think it's -- I think it's way -- it's going to be -- New Hampshire is going to be the key to making this a slimmer field.WALLACE:  Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week,"" Donald Trump's right-hand man.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  With the presidential race now at fever pitch, we want to take you inside the campaigns to meet some of the key figures behind the candidates. And there was only one choice for who should go first. Here's our ""Power Player of the Week.""(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  What's it like managing Donald Trump?COREY LEWANDOWSKI, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: That's a tough question. Nobody manages Mr. Trump. I think -- I equate this to being a jockey on the greatest racehorse you've ever seen. Maybe American Pharaoh.WALLACE: (voice-over): Corey Lewandowski runs the Trump campaign, and the jokey analogy works because Corey says while he may guide his candidate occasionally, his main job is to hang on and let Trump run.TRUMP: Oh, that is amazing.WALLACE (on camera): When he gets up on the stage, or when he does an interview, do you know what's going to happen beforehand?LEWANDOWSKI: I don't think anybody knows. I mean that's -- that's what the American people love. He tells it like it is.WALLACE (voice-over): But Corey says, experts underestimate the organization behind the man, noting their state director in Iowa is Chuck Laudner, who helped Rick Santorum win the caucuses in 2012.LEWANDOWSKI: We have our faith in Chuck because he know what he's doing. This is the Super Bowl for Chuck. This is Christmas and the Super Bowl combined.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Caucus for Donald Trump. You need caucus cards?LEWANDOWSKI: I find it just fundamentally wrong the notion that those people who waited six hours in line to attend a one-hour political rally aren't going to walk in on caucus night and say, I'm supporting Donald Trump. I just don't believe it.WALLACE (voice-over): Corey says there's another misconception about Trump.WALLACE (on camera): Do you ever tell him no? And, if so, does he listen?LEWANDOWSKI: When he asks for advice, and we tell him no all the time and he listens, but like everything else, you'll be selective and you choose the right places to insert yourself.TRUMP: Sometimes he'll hold me back a little bit, which is good. He has tremendous energy, the opposite of Jeb Bush. He has tremendous energy. Going all the time. And he really does have a good vision for politics.LEWANDOWSKI: Hang on one second, OK?WALLACE: (voice-over): Corey admits he's an adrenalin junkie. When we visited campaign headquarters, he had to burn off energy. He even has a wall of shame with unflattering photos of each candidate he's dropped out.LEWANDOWSKI: The professional pundit class doesn't know what to do.WALLACE: How did he get into politics?LEWANDOWSKI: I was six years old and I turned on the television and I heard Ronald Reagan say ""strong military, smaller government,"" and I said, I don't know who that is but I like that guy.WALLACE: Why in college, he ran for state representative in his hometown of Lowell, Massachusetts, and lost big. Then there was a stint working on Capitol Hill and for the RNC. But over the last 15 years, he moved away from the GOP establishment.LEWANDOWSKI: It was the end of the day, nothing's getting done.WALLACE:  He worked four years as a New Hampshire state policeman.LEWANDOWSKI: Right, I get to go around and arrest people for, you know, boating while intoxicated. That was a great job. It was a fantastic job. And they paid me to do this. And I said, I can't believe it.WALLACE:  And in 2011, Corey he debated a cardboard cutout of New Hampshire's Democratic governor about taxes.LEWANDOWSKI: Yes, this is the greatest place, right?WALLACE:  All of which has some people saying, Donald Trump's campaign manager is a lot like him.LEWANDOWSKI: Watching him in action, and that is what drives us every day. He -- he will not be outworked. There's nothing he won't do to be successful in this endeavor.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: Corey has been called a bomb thrower who dismisses country club Republicans. Little wonder then Trump hired him to run his presidential campaign a year ago.Now, this program note. Next Sunday I'll sit down with Republican candidate, Senator Marco Rubio, just ahead of the next GOP debate. It's a Sunday exclusive.And that's it for today.
