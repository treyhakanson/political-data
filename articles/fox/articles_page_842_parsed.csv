1	1	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/07/08/bill-oreilly-murder-kate-steinle/	Bill O'Reilly: The murder of Kate Steinle	"As The Factor reported last night, 32-year-old Miss Steinle was murdered walking with her father in San Francisco, allegedly by a criminal alien who had been deported five times and had seven felony convictions in the U.S.A. That man, 45-year-old Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez now charged with murder. He was arraigned today in a San Francisco courtroom.Talking Points said last night that the mayor of San Francisco Ed Lee and the 11 city supervisors are directly responsible for Kate's death. That's because San Francisco is a sanctuary city that does not cooperate with the federal government even on holding and identifying criminal aliens.Sanchez was in custody in San Francisco and the sheriff, Ross Mirkarimi let him out defying ICE officials.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why not inform ICE when you have a felon in your custody? Why not draw the line at some place where maybe you are protecting the public?ROSS MIRKARIMI, SAN FRANCISCO SHERIFF: They already know he is in our custody. They actually knew because he came from serving time in another prison.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Then why not work with them to make sure he doesn't get released?MIRKARIMI: Well, because a detainer request is not a legal instrument.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Oh, bull. The sheriff should resign immediately. I mean what kind of law officer allows a known felon to walk free when the feds want him in custody? Asked him to keep him in custody. The sheriff is incompetent -- period. Out of there. And so are the folks who run the city of San Francisco, most of whom are now hiding.CBS News caught with San Francisco supervisor Julie Christensen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In the last 18 months more than 10,000 undocumented immigrants have been released from custody in California without immigration officials being notified. Since Kathryn Steinle's death San Francisco's elected officials have been avoiding speaking about sanctuary. Julie Christensen is a member of the board of supervisors.JULIE CHRISTENSEN (D), SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: I'm not going to address that in detail.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I mean the fact that if San Francisco wasn't a sanctuary city, would Kate still be alive?CHRISTENSEN: I'm not going to go there.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Miss Christensen is a coward. The cold truth is Kate Steinle is collateral damage to the insane far-left politics that have long corrupted the city by the bay. Again, dangerous people are walking around because of political correctness. The mayor and the supervisors want to seem sympathetic to illegal aliens. That's what this is all about -- them and their liberal profile. The whole thing is absolutely disgusting.Now, there is some good news today as Kate may not have died vain. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell told The Factor he is meeting with the senate leadership to discuss Kate's law. As we suggested last night Congress should pass legislation that would impose a mandatory minimum five-year sentence on any illegal alien that's deported and then comes back. The word ""mandatory"" is crucial.There are laws on the books now that are being ignored. Congress must write Kate's law so if officials do not enforce the mandatory sentence, they themselves, can be prosecuted. Congressman Matt Salmon of Arizona tells us he is writing Kate's law even as we speak. The congressman is looking for co-sponsors.We hope representatives from both parties will sign on. If they do, we will tell you who they are. If anyone opposes Kate's law, we will absolutely tell you who they are.Also, you can get involved. We have a petition on BillOReilly.com that supports Kate's law. We hope you will sign it and we will forward the petition to the House and Senate leadership as well as to the White House. More than four million people a night watch this program. If we get four million signatures on that, that would be quite something.It is long past time for the congress of the United States to protect the American people. Every president since Ronald Reagan has not done so. So Congress must act on illegal immigration. This sanctuary city business has got to end. Any American city, town, or county, not cooperating with Homeland Security should immediately lose federal funding. Enough is enough.That's ""The Memo"".Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" February 9, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In most races, delegates are a foregone conclusion. But in this race with this many people, delegates are going to matter.GOV. JOHN KASICH, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's really been a great run. I've had an absolute ball, and of course I'll be back for the fall campaign.DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I just want to do well. I want to win even if it's by one vote. I would like to do it maybe a little better than that, but I want to win. It's very important to me.GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is far from over. We have work to do. This is going to be incredibly close, everybody.JEB BUSH, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's amazing how many people don't make their mind up until the very he said. It is a uniquely New Hampshire experience.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: It is uniquely New Hampshire, late deciders. And late deciders are having a big impact tonight from everything we're seeing so far. We also want to show you this ballot I showed you the other night. There are 30 names on the Republican side on this ballot, and it's pretty interesting to see. And there you see a sample ballot there.As far as who people are talking about on Facebook, Donald Trump and John Kasich are leading the way. And on the Democratic side, it is Bernie Sanders. And there you see kind of the breakdown on the conversation that they're having, the economy driving the issues.Let's bring in our expanded panel, Steve Hayes, senior writer for ""The Weekly Standard,"" James Pindell, a political reporter for the ""Boston Globe,"" Kirsten Powers, ""USA Today"" columnist, David Catanese, senior politics writer for ""U.S. News and World Report."" OK, guys, we are digesting some of these numbers. Obviously voting is still going on. I want to be careful about characterizing some of it. But Steve, what do you see here.STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Certainly on the issues, Donald Trump is dominating. He's dominating across the board on the issues. Immigration, people who said that was their most important issue, Donald Trump took 44 percent, economy and jobs, 30 percent, terrorism, 26 percent, government spending, 29 percent. The top choice of all of the issues sets was Donald Trump. He also did quite well among vote who say they value a candidate who tells it like it is, someone who is blunt and straightforward. And 62 percent of voters who saw that as the most important characteristic of a candidate picked Donald Trump. I think that probably stepped a lot on Chris Christie since that was his campaign slogan, telling it like it is.BAIER: James, evangelical voters, smaller population here in New Hampshire. Ted Cruz, I talked to him about it today. It doesn't line up perfectly for him. But if he finishes in the top three he could get some wind behind his sails heading to South Carolina.JAMES PINDELL, BOSTON GLOBE: That's right. And he should finish quite well. One thing he's been able to do in this state, and he did it a couple months ago, is consolidate conservatives behind him. Those people who think that Ted Cruz and New Hampshire do not mix, you do have to understand that there are so many candidates and the vote is split so many different ways that if first place is around 30 percent, the second place, you're in the teens. And are one-fifth of New Hampshire Republican Ted Cruz Republicans? You bet.BAIER: And you've been here this turnout. Is it living up to everything the secretary of state said?PINDELL: It has been. We have been hearing reports. You had a traffic jam just south of here earlier today. You are seeing record turnout in a lot of different communities tonight.BAIER: Kirsten?KIRSTEN POWERS, USA TODAY: I think one of the things I've been looking for is the Sanders phenomenon has been a lot about him digging into a little bit to some of Hillary's strongholds last time, people who made less than $50,000, for example, he is doing very well with them tonight. With women, he was in the polls before we came into this he was doing much better than Barack Obama did against Hillary Clinton. We're seeing that sort of being borne out. He is getting pretty broad based support, Sanders is getting pretty broad based support from pretty much everybody. But in particular it's interesting, if you look at women, he's doing very well.BAIER: On the Republican side, David, I think you can't really look at these numbers and say definitively Marco Rubio took it on the chin from that debate. But you can say that late deciders looked at Trump and looked at Kasich and didn't seem to be looking too much for Marco Rubio.DAVID CATANESE, U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT: I did talk to a Republican pollster with access to Ted Cruz's final polling over the weekend and said that they tracked a precipitous decline of Rubio over the weekend, not just on the ballot which was 67 points but also his favorability rating went down. So the Cruz people are hoping that this hurts Rubio, because a third place finish for Cruz here would be great. A fourth place finish would be fine. But if Rubio ends up in fifth place tonight, or in fourth place, I think that's a big story.The other big thing is what is Donald Trump's number and margin? Everybody agrees he's going to win, but did he get over 30 percent? Does he win by five points or 10 points? I think that's a big part of the narrative.PINDELL: To pick up on what David just said here, New Hampshire is supposed to decide this establishment lane. And what happens if it doesn't? It may well just go to South Carolina if these folks are clumped between second and fifth. And the second part of that is what happened exactly with Marco Rubio? I think if you're Jeb Bush, you just want Marco Rubio somewhat damaged. You can go below him. You want him damaged going forward.HAYES: I don't think Bush can finish below Rubio. I think that's trouble. Bush is clearly going on. The super PAC is spending in these states. But I think if he finishes below Rubio in fourth or fifth place that will be trouble.The other interesting number that jumped out at me was people who thought electability was most important. Rubio won that here in New Hampshire as well as in Iowa, but it is a much smaller share of the voters. Here only 11 percent said that was their most important candidate characteristic. In Iowa it was 21 percent. Rubio won 44 percent of those in Iowa, 37 percent here. So he took a little hit here.BAIER: Yes, polls are again still open some of them all the way until 8:00 p.m. eastern time. I brought in Facebook and the conversation on Facebook earlier. Google also provides data and what the search is. And there you see the latest breakdown, Rubio, Carson, Kasich, interestingly one of the top questions about Donald Trump, ""where does Donald Trump stay in New Hampshire?"" That was a search question on Google.(LAUGHTER)BAIER: Kirsten, from those conversations, sometimes we can see what people are interested in.POWERS: It is fascinating to watch the types of things. We actually know where he's staying. I think he is staying in our hotel, the lovely Holiday Inn, Manchester. So I think the great thing about this also is just the excitement we've seen in this election that people have gotten so engaged, especially on the Republican side. At least in 2008 it was the Democrats, and now you see that kind of excitement for this race.BAIER: Quickly.CATANESE: Speaking of staying, back to James' point, does New Hampshire winnow the field at all? I think it might for Chris Christie. If he is in single digits, I think Jeb may stay in, Kasich, obviously all go on. But is Chris Christie still a candidate a week from now? That's another question I have. If he is below 10 percent, is anybody going to give him money? Does he have a rationale to go on in sixth place?CATANESE: I hate to say it, but also Carly Fiorina.BAIER: Which is also interesting. After the debate he went on the attack, and was it a double edged sword.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

4	4	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/10/21/election-outlook-voter-turnout-key-races/	Election outlook: Voter turnout in key races	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" October 20, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REINCE PRIEBUS, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Americans, like so many other issues that the president is touching right now. have lost confidence in this president's ability to lead. There is a malaise in this country of how people are feelings that this president is handling big problems.REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  The president isn't on to the ballot here. Republicans are desperate to put him on the ballot because they are trying to run away from their own terrible record.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Well, the chairs of both parties on ""Fox News Sunday"" this weekend. This as the president is now campaigning in a couple of different campaign events, one of them in Maryland for the lieutenant governor who is running for governor.And as you look at the pictures, while the president is speaking, a lot of people noticed that people started moving out and leaving. In fact Reuters reported it this way, ""President Barack Obama made a rare appearance on the campaign trail on Sunday with the rally to support the Democratic candidate for governor in Maryland. But early departures of crowd members while he spoke underscored his continuing unpopularity."" Different reporters reported it differently. You see the pictures.Let's bring in our political panel here in New York, Jason Riley, editorial board member of the Wall Street Journal, Ellison Barber, staff writer for The Washington Free Beacon, and Jim Rutenberg, chief political correspondent New York Times Magazine. Jim, when you see that and you see all these ads tying back to every policy is on the ballot, you wonder how much this president is factoring in to this election.JIM RUTENBERG, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE:  Yes, that 40 percent or in thereabouts kind of approval rating is a mess. And you have a president, second term, midterms, there should be like blues songs about it if politics is more soulful. So he comes into this. It's going to be rough, and things are even worse than they may have expected.BAIER: You look at the Wall Street Journal question, which party do you prefer, registered voters say Republicans 45 percent, Democrats 43 percent. Then you go to the likely screen at it jumps, Republican 49 percent, Democrat 44 percent. Ellison, what, you know, how do you see Democrats across the board dealing with these numbers?ELLISON BARBER, WASHINGTON FREE BEACON: It's interesting because The Washington Post had a poll last week as well that they said their overall party approval rating is somewhere around 30 percent, which is the lowest it has been for them. But then you look at Republicans and their approval rating is similarly not good. I think the thing that you always go back to and look at is what the president's approval rating is. And Gallup had a poll today where the said for the 23rd quarter from July to October his average approval rating was 41.5 percent. It is difficult for Democrats to possibly combat an approval rating like that. When have the majority of Americans disapproving of the president and disapproving of him on almost every single issue. And I think that is something that for Democrats to overcome is incredibly difficult.BAIER: Jason?JASON RILEY, WALL STREET JOURNAL: And it's not just a red state Democrat problem. That's what's so remarkable about the Maryland footage. That's a deep blue state that Obama won by 26 points in 2012. It's quite remarkable I think. But what's also remarkable to me is the reaction to this from the White House which is to make overt racial appeals to get out the base. We have the president of the United States and an attorney general making overt racial appeals to voters. I find that very disturbing, Bret.       BAIER: How so?RILEY: Well, the voter ID stuff that they've been talking about constantly as if there's some sort of Republican conspiracy out there to deny blacks the franchise. It's just not true. Black voter turnout in 2012 was higher than white voter turnout in 2012. And on another level, why should blacks be eager to run to the polls to support the Senate Democrats and Harry Reid. What have they done for blacks? Black unemployment is higher. Black labor participation rates are the lowest they have been in 30 years. Black poverty is going up. Why should blacks be enthusiastic about getting out to the polls to keep the president's party in power? There's no reason for them to be. But to have a president out there pushing this racial angle, we have had stories in both the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal to this effect, I think is very troubling.BAIER: Jim, we talked about ground game. Mike Emanuel had a big piece about this. It is the factor that everybody focuses on as we come into two weeks. Democrats usually have a very strong ground game. If you look at the early votes, though, the breakdown, it's pretty evenly distributed.RUTENBERG: Yeah. And some of these early states, you're not seeing the huge Democratic advantages that you have seen in the past. I think a lot of people are looking at Colorado as maybe the first great test case in some of these ground game sort of numbers. The problem with the ground game numbers are they're very hard to track in real-time. I mean, you can say how many doors were knocked upon. We're not going to know until the very end. But I will say this. I think the Republicans have made up some ground. And I also think if this ends up being a wave election or even a half a wave election, the Democratic advantages are not going to show up.BAIER: Let's look at some of the races that are changing here. If you look at, let's see, New Hampshire, there's a new poll out in New Hampshire about Scott Brown three points back and the Real Clear Politics average I think has it even closer than that. That's one that Democrats really, Ellison, weren't really prepared to fight for.BARBER: Yeah. There are quite a few states from Iowa to Colorado that Democrats weren't thinking they were going to have to fight, and I don't think Republicans necessarily thought they were going to be able to flip them.And when I spoke to Republican staffers kind of about their ground game earlier today, they said they were more competitive in places like Iowa and Colorado because they have completely restructured the way they are doing their ground game from 2012. And you look at some of the early voting data that's come out of a place like Iowa where they say right now of the people that have voted, 43 percent of those people have been Democrats, 40 percent have been Republicans. Democrats are still ahead there, but that is substantially better than what it was last time around when only 32 percent of those early voters were actually Republicans. And Republicans say they have reached out to voters in different ways and gotten data in different ways than they have in the past.And one of the most interesting things that I think I have learned from them talking with some of the staffers about this today is they said one of things they have done is they have changed their get out the vote effort and their messaging. And in Iowa specifically they're using this tactic where they're using social pressure to target voters through pamphlets and e-mails by saying don't be the only person in your neighborhood that doesn't vote. And they say that they have noticed that that has been incredibly effective for them in somewhere like Iowa.BAIER: I tell you, if I get one more email from both parties about, you know, we're really disappointed. Answer our e-mails.One question, Georgia, this has gone the other way. Michelle Nunn has really closed that gap and some have her leading. The Real Clear Politics average is at 1.4 with the Republican up down there. But you talk about an African-American effort to get out the vote. Georgia is a place where that moves the needle.RILEY: The challenge she has is she's trying to distance herself from a president, and that doesn't go over too well with the black voters she needs to come out and support here. Kentucky, Alison Grimes has got the same problem, won't even say whether she voted for Obama. But her indifference on that or her unwillingness to come forward with that is hurting her with the black voters that she needs. So that's the -- sort of the catch 22 that these red state Democrats have.BAIER: I want to go down the line here. Is Ebola factoring into this election?RILEY: I think so, but only at the margin, only at the margin.BARBER: Maybe a little bit in terms of just there's a general dissatisfaction and distrust in the way that the government right now is handling things.  I'm not sure that it necessarily something that will be a major issue in two weeks, but it factors into the general distrust.RUTENBERG: And I would say in some states more than others. I hate to shout out to a competitor, but The Washington Post had a very good piece today about the North Carolina race where the Ebola and ISIS are just kind of shifting the campaign debate in a way that hurts Hagan, the Democrat.BAIER: We do it all the time. So thanks you for joining us. We really appreciate it. Thank you.We'll talk about all things economy with a special economic panel coming up.Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
