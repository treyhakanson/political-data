"Now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine:State of PlayThe arrest of Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich has put the spotlight back on Chicago's machine-style politics and history of corruption. But by one standard, Illinois is not even close to being the nation's most corrupt state. U.S.A. Today reports an analysis of Justice Department statistics reveals Illinois -- on a per capita basis -- ranks 18th in the number of federal corruption convictions from 1998 to 2007.North Dakota is number one with more than eight convictions per 100,000 people. Rounding out the top five are Louisiana, Alaska, Mississippi and Montana.But Don Morrison of the North Dakota Center for Public Good says people there are just better at rooting out corruption. ""Being a sparsely populated state, people know each other...to do what the governor of Illinois did is much more difficult here.""Coming CleanA Maryland company that cleaned the home of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff for about three years allegedly employed illegal aliens. The Washington Post reports at least five of those workers were undocumented even though the Secret Service routinely screened employee ID's. The company's owner James Reid has been fined more than $22,000. But he says that is excessive.Reid says, ""Our homeland security can't police their own home. How can they police our borders? No one wants to put the blame on the head; they'd rather put the blame on the business owner.""Chertoff fired Reid's company when he learned of the situation in April.Papers PleaseAn Oklahoma state lawmaker is proposing legislation requiring anyone running for public office in that state to show proof of citizenship. The Oklahoman newspaper reports Republican state Senator Mike Ritz is motivated by questions surrounding President-elect Obama's citizenship.Candidates would have to submit a copy of their birth certificate and some form of government-issued identification. No I.D. is currently required to file with the state's election board, although candidates must sign an affidavit stating they are registered voters. Oklahoma's Democratic Party Chairman Ivan Holmes says the move appears to be ""another typical Republican ploy of sour grapes.""The U.S. Supreme Court declined Monday to hear a challenge to Mr. Obama's electoral eligibility. More challenges, however, are still pending.Away in a MangerAnd finally, you may remember the campaign ad calling then Senator Obama ""the chosen one."" Well now President-elect Obama and wife Michelle are apparently being ""chosen"" to appear in a very familiar religious scene -- the Nativity -- alongside Baby Jesus, the Virgin Mary, Joseph and the Three Wise Men.In the city of Naples, Italy -- the production of handmade figurines is big business. Craftsmen traditionally provide a light-hearted approach -- by making replicas of the year's newsmakers.""The ones we are selling the most of are those of barrack Obama... along with his wife Michelle,"" says an Italian Nativity scene craftsman.Other popular Nativity figurines this year are French President Nicolas Sarkozy, his wife Carla Bruni and Italian President Silvio Berlusconi. No word from the Obama transition office about any reaction from the incoming First Couple about being included.-- FOX News Channel's Zachary Kenworthy contributed to this report."

McaAuliffe makes the statement in a memoir due to go on sale later this month.He is highly critical of the Kerry campaign's decision not to criticize President Bush more harshly, and says he was ""flabbergasted"" to learn after the election that Kerry had $15 million left in campaign funds that could have been spent in a final push.McAuliffe also quotes President Bush -- telling Bill Clinton in September of 2004: ""the Kerry campaign is the most inept group I have ever seen in politics. Don't let them ruin your reputation."" And he says John McCain was also critical of Kerry's strategy, saying, ""my guy (Bush) is no great shakes, but your guy (Kerry) looks like a wimp.""""Bunch of Losers""Colorado Republican Governor Bill Owens says the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is ""a bunch of losers."" He is reacting to PETA's refusal to help some of the 340,000 cows and steers left stranded by southeastern Colorado's most recent snowstorm. A PETA spokesman told a Denver radio station that the group would not spend money to save the animals because, ""In six months they're going to be killed and end up on someone's plate.""Governor Owens told the station he was amazed that PETA ""doesn't want us to feed freezing cattle"" and said ""it's symbolic of what PETA stands for."" Owens also called PETA ""a strange group of people"" and told listeners, ""don't send money to PETA.""CAIR ReversalCalifornia Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer has rescinded a certificate honoring the Sacramento chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations -- after learning the group has been accused of supporting terrorism.The chapter's director got a certificate in November from Boxer in recognition of his outstanding service. But then Boxer saw accounts that some CAIR officials have been sentenced to prison, and that the group has refused to label Hamas and Hezbollah terrorist organizations and refused to condemn Usama bin Laden.Says Boxer, ""We made a bad mistake not researching the organization. My organization created this problem. I caused people grief, and I feel terrible. Yet I need to set the record straight, and I'm setting the record straight.""Statue SwitchThe state of California is going to switch out one of the two statues it is allowed to display at the U.S. Capitol building in Washington. A bronze likeness of Thomas Starr King has been in national statuary hall since 1931.King was credited by Abraham Lincoln with preventing California from becoming a separate republic during the Civil War. But the state has decided to replace his statue with one of a modern day hero -- President Ronald Reagan -- who also served as California governor. The new Reagan statue will be installed sometime this year.King's statue will be taken to the California state capitol in Sacramento.--FOX News Channel's Martin Hill contributed to this report."

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Now, the left wing's relentless assault on civility in politics continues in the wake of the terrible tragedy in Tucson. This time liberal radio host John ""Sly"" Sylvester is getting in on the act. You may recall that Sylvester made headlines in 2004 when he referred to then-National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice as ""Aunt Jemima.""Now he's turning his sexist and hate filled act on Wisconsin Lieutenant Governor Rebecca Kleefisch. Now, listen to how Sylvester impersonated Kleefisch on a recent show.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN ""SLY"" SYLVESTER, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: I'm Rebecca Kleefisch. I perform fellatio on all the talk show hosts in Milwaukee. And they endorse me and that's how I became lieutenant governor.(LAUGHTER)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Bless her heart.SLYVESTER: And then I got colon cancer and I ran around the state to help people. Even though I have government health care, screw everyone else.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Now, since making those despicable comments, Sylvester has apologized for making the sexual reference you just heard. However, he is not apologizing for the remarks about the lieutenant governor's battle with cancer. Instead, he reiterated on the show that he believes Kleefisch used her cancer to get elected.Now, through his radio station's program director, Sylvester wimped out and declined to appear on tonight's program. But joining me now is the person who was subjected to this insensitive political rant, she is lieutenant governor of the great state of Wisconsin, Rebecca Kleefisch.Rebecca, thank you for being with us.REBECCA KLEEFISCH, WISCONSIN LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: Good evening, Sean. How are you?HANNITY: All right. So, you hear what this guy says -- by the way, I'm going to play a tape because I've had a run-in with this guy in the past -- but, that you are making sexual favors, that you are using your cancer -- by the way, you survived colon cancer, correct?KLEEFISCH: Yes, yes, I'm on chemo right now.HANNITY: You're on chemo right now which is one of the most difficult things anybody has to go through. And he makes these comments. How did that make you feel?KLEEFISCH: Well, the comments that he made, as you heard, some of them at least, were vile. I mean, they were violating. You can't really choose many more foul words to say to a woman than what this gentleman -- and I use the term loosely -- chose.I have two little girls at home. And some day, they are going to be able to search the Internet and I fear some day, they're going to find these comments. I don't want to have to explain to them what these terms mean. This was really unfortunate.HANNITY: Yes.KLEEFISCH: And so, I'm glad that the American Cancer Society in the state of Wisconsin, spoke up. They said that this was unacceptable and demanded an apology. And Sly Sylvester did actually apologize. It is disappointing though that it wasn't a full-fledged apology.HANNITY: Yes.Well, I got into this with him when he made the comments about Condoleezza Rice back in 2004. And it was the same thing. It is not really a full, complete apology. I'm going to play it for you. And then I have a question out of this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: You are doing the show, you're attacking people.SYLVESTER: No.HANNITY: You demean them and you insult them, you're mean, you're cruel and you're thoughtless. And this is your way.(CROSSTALK) SYLVESTER: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Did you have me on to talk to me or are you just going to talk over me?HANNITY: I think you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Why don't you just do the right thing and give a real apology. I'll give you all the time you need.SYLVESTER: I did apologize to the African-American community. I'm not going to apologize for her behavior.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: So, this is his gig. He says these outrageous things and he's a moral coward and he gets away and the radio station supports him. Would you like to have recourse of some kind against him?KLEEFISCH: You know what? I think the best recourse here is to forgive the guy and to move on. Because, you know, the thing that made him so angry, the thing that inspired all this visceral hatred toward me was the fact that I was just doing my job, Sean.You know, I was elected to be the lieutenant governor of the state of Wisconsin. And you have heard recently, that we have a bit of a border battle going on with Illinois. You know, right now, Illinois has raised their personal income tax. They've raised the corporate income tax. I was making cold calls down to Illinois businesses to show them that Wisconsin is open for business again. And we are eager to foster a great relationship with Illinois businesses and Wisconsin businesses alike who want to grow.I was doing my job and it got him so angry, that he actually decided to make these comments on the air.HANNITY: What do you make about the broader issue? The president at the memorial in Tucson talks about civility and he's used incendiary language even prior to the election -- enemies, they can sit in the back, bring a knife, we'll bring a gun -- and now, since then Democrats have referred to Republicans as Nazis, as killers and now -- as we played earlier tonight -- racists. Do you think the left gets away with this more than the right?KLEEFISCH: It is unacceptable. And I think we had seen it for the last several years when we talk about Tea Party discourse -- this isn't political discourse that you heard on that radio show. This is the type of personal attack that makes us stop passionate debate and have to address comments that are just out and out false. It meant to stop the debate, because --(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Last question, I don't want to interrupt you. Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann, conservative women, yourself -- why are conservative women singled out more often?KLEEFISCH: It's a good question. I think probably because liberals embrace women as a group that sometimes they feel that they take ownership of. And there are some of us who don't believe in the same value system that a lot of these liberal groups have.We are independent thinkers. We have traditional values. And we stand on our own merits.HANNITY: Yes, all right. Lieutenant Governor, you've shown a lot of grace and dignity under, you know, difficult circumstances. All the best for your health and your family --KLEEFISCH: Thank you.HANNITY: And we really appreciate you being with us, thank you.KLEEFISCH: Thanks for having me.HANNITY: By the way, Mr. Sylvester, if you had any guts at all, come here and say these remarks. You're too much of a coward.Content and Programming Copyright 2011 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2011 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
