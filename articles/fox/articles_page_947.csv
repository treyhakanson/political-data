This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: Well, the president is great at finding ways to raise money.To the Republican who toppled Eric Cantor on his way to storming Washington on maybe finding just as creative ways to save money.But, Congressman, that doesn't happen. Why not?REP. DAVE BRAT, R-VA.: Hey, Neil. Good to be on.Well, it doesn't happen because, as you just covered, we're in this back- and-forth sound bite politics up here in D.C., instead of doing basic economics. Just have your people go out to the Federal Reserve Web site on capital investment. The United States for the past 30 years is like this, flatter than a pancake, and China's is like this. And everybody knows it.That's physical capital. And then human capital, innovation and creativity and that thing, our kids are not at the top of the world anymore in math and science scores. Those are the fundamentals that are going to cause economic growth.So, when it comes to President Obama proposing policies, just ask the reader or listener to grant him everything he wants, to say, look, OK, everything -- do everything you just proposed. Will that solve the problem?And the answer is no. And so then you come over to the Republican side, and say, hey, if you let the Republicans run the ship here and get tax policies straight to incentivize capital investment, change the monopoly in the public school system, really start doing smart R&D and getting science back in the schools and universities, that can produce an economic revolution. I think we all know that is the case.So we're asking for that chance.CAVUTO: Do you think, though, Congressman, he is trying to lure Republicans into a bit of a trap here by saying, look, the increases I'm proposing would affect the top 1 percent, and most of them the top 0.1 percent,so the Congressman is defending the super rich and not looking after the swap I'm doing to give the middle class tax breaks?What do you say and how do you respond to that?BRAT: Yes. And I -- like I was saying, I don't even respond to that. His -- his proposals are nowhere in the relevant economic range.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: Well, what do you think Republicans should do, Congressman?BRAT: I think Republicans should focus on the biggest economic problem we have in the country. Go to the debt clock, it's $18 trillion. Go to the bottom, the unfunded liabilities are $127 trillion.Those four entitlement programs take up the entire federal budget, the entire federal budget by 2032. I think Republicans ought to focus on that. That is 70 percent of the budget currently that is squeezing out military, education, and everything else. That's why we are all feeling the crimp, and so you -- in economics, you focus first on the biggest issue, and the $127 trillion is by far the biggest issue.CAVUTO: No doubt, but, Congressman, people who aren't schooled in this stuff or don't follow this stuff, nowhere does the debt approach the top five issues with Americans.Now, you eloquently articulated what is going on here, but the urgency seems to be lost on a lot of folks. How would you, how would Republicans, how should Republicans bring that in a way that can crystallize this?BRAT: Yes.CAVUTO: Because a lot of people talk about it, but it's like walking by the graveyard. Yes, yes, they're -- they're underground, but not me.BRAT: Right. Right.Well, you crystallize it by telling the next generation, they are the only group that doesn't have a lobbyist in D.C. The next generation of kids -- I taught for the last 20 years -- they need a lobbyist quick because all of this debt and the unfunded liabilities is coming due on their credit card.It's an ethical shame, what we're doing to them, and then, secondly, you tell the seniors that when the Democrats threaten the Republicans as shutting down these systems, that's false. These systems, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, et cetera, are going to shut down automatically in 2032. They're shut down.The Republicans are trying to reform and maintain these systems for the elderly and, just as importantly, for the next generation of kids, so that they have these social safety systems in place as they progress like we did.CAVUTO: All right, Congressman, we will watch very, very closely.It all begins tomorrow night.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.

" This is a rush transcript from ""On the Record,"" January 19, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, 'ON THE RECORD' GUEST HOST: Representative Marsha Blackburn joins us.Thanks for being with us tonight and going ON THE RECORD.REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN, R-TENN.: Sure.GUILFOYLE: Your thoughts and predictions for tomorrow night?BLACKBURN: Listening to all of that, you know the president is trying to tune up his version of that old B.J. Thomas, ""Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song.""(LAUGHTER)And it is always somebody else's fault. Somebody has to pay. The American people are just not listening to it. They don't agree.GUILFOYLE: Don't you think it is about time people do stand up and say, listen, we don't want to send our hardworking, hard-earned dollars to D.C. to be abused and tossed around and not accounted for?BLACKBURN: You're exactly right, Kimberly. They don't want to send it to federal agencies that listen in on your phone calls, snoop on your mail, an IRS that is going to exact political retribution on conservative groups. Then they turn around, the end of the day, they don't want to pay the military. They just want to pay bureaucrats more. People are tired of it.Government is overtaxed -- people are overtaxed. Government is overspent. We do have not a revenue problem. You know we brought in the most money ever, the most money ever, in 2014, $3 trillion in revenue. And what does this president does not understand is that you have to make certain you're lowering all of the rates, getting more people into the process, paying taxes, so you increase those revenues. And he still doesn't understand the best economic stimulus is a job. And that is what people want the focus to be.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, well, unfortunately, he has a completely different idea of what should happen. Seems to have a tone deaf ear to midterm election results. Instead, it's business as usual. And he will put forward, you know, his politics and his policies despite the clear message from the American people.BLACKBURN: You're exactly right. And he is tone deaf. That is precisely what is happening. And they just think they can go ahead and start saying this, throw out all of these grandiose ideas. The American dream is not being dependent on the federal government for your health care, for your automobile, for your college education, for your student loan, on and on and on. The American dream is independence and being able to create that dream for yourself. And they don't want government taking more of their freedom and then having to live the way government prescribed. And all of this college education and these other programs, I tell you, it is not selling well out here with my constituents.GUILFOYLE: What would you like to see the Republicans put forward to show that clearly there is a definitive choice that can be made for the economic future of this country?BLACKBURN: There are several things we can do, precisely cutting discretionary spending. 1 percent across the board saves us $4 billion in one year. Say that times 10. Go to 5 percent. What you can do with cutting, getting here and reform all of the entitlements, beginning with Medicaid. Stabilize Social Security and Medicare, which are trust funds. And then let's lower rates, not raise the rates. You know, look at what this does to seniors when you talk about raising cap gains, taxing investments that seniors have made building their nest egg so that they can retire.The president does not understand. The federal government cannot get in here and control all of this. It makes things worse. It doesn't make things better. And what he's going to find is a Congress that is going to say, look, we are for reducing the size of the federal government, taxing people less, having government spend less --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Less regulation.BLACKBURN: That's right. A good formula to remember, less regulation plus less taxation plus less litigation always equals more innovation and job creation. That's what the president ought to say tomorrow night.GUILFOYLE: Let's hope we can get this country back on track, and with some strong leadership like coming from yourself to help hardworking Americans at home.Representative, thank you so much.BLACKBURN: Good to be with you."

3	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/05/28/bill-oreilly-liberal-versus-conservative-americans/	Bill O'Reilly: Liberal versus conservative Americans	"A new poll by Gallup says right now in the U.S.A. left and right wing Americans are tied in numbers. A poll of more than 1,000 adults asked Americans to describe themselves on social issues: 5 percent say they are very conservative; 26 percent conservative in general; 33 percent moderate; 21 percent liberal; 10 percent very liberal; 4 percent don't know what they are.That's the first time since 1999 that conservatives have not outnumbered liberals in this area. So why is it happening? I call it the ""Watters' World"" syndrome that more Americans are simply ignorant of the consequences involving social behavior.As Talking Points has often pointed out, the rise of the net has taken people away from the real world and put them in a fantasy world. That's one of the reasons I created ""Watters' World"" where Jesse Watters asks folks about what they know about the real world. On liberal issues, it's kind of frightening.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: What is Obamacare?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No idea.WATTERS: So you support Obamacare, you just don't really know how it works.Vermont is a very liberal state. Why do you think that is?Do you know what liberal means?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nope.WATTERS: What benefit does it have to the country to legalize weed?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean --WATTERS: So, what is earth day?So if the earth is warming, you get more snow?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.WATTERS: So if the earth starts to cool, would we get less snow?(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Now, granted ""Watters' World"" is just a small slice of life, but I believe only about 50 percent of the American people take the time to understand important issues. Half the country does not. They are simpletons -- unwilling and unable to discipline themselves into formulating a philosophy of life.The second factor driving the trend to the left in the U.S.A. is the media but not the news media. Not the news media. Most Americans don't even bother with the news anymore. It's the entertainment industry combined with social media that are putting forth a more libertine lifestyle. There is no question about that.In cyberspace, progressive Web sites vastly outnumber traditional Web sites. That's because traditional people don't use the net as much as their progressive counterparts. So the stars are lined up in favor of liberal thought and that is a powerful influence.Now let's take a look at the social issues themselves. 2001 just 40 percent of the American public believe gay or lesbian relations were morally acceptable. Now that number stands at 63 percent -- huge change. That's because the entertainment industry has mainstreamed the gay lifestyle. ""Modern Family"", for example, one of the most successful programs in the world and even though it's a comedy, the message of tolerance sinks in especially among younger Americans. Then you had a heavy dose of the stars themselves being liberal on gay issues and you have the change agent.Also on the gay marriage issue, those opposed to it have not been able to vividly articulate their vision and some, who support gay marriage, have branded the opposition as bigots -- a powerful, but unfair indictment.Second issue -- having a baby outside of marriage: in 2002 45 percent of Americans found it morally acceptable; today 61 percent. Again, that's driven by the entertainment industry and lack of peer pressure to keep child-rearing within the marital arena. Although some Americans can raise children outside of marriage very well, this trend has badly damaged our society, often leading to poverty and lack of supervision for children. Millions of kids are getting hammered.On the subject of abortion: 2001, 42 percent found it morally acceptable. 14 years later, 45 percent do. Now, this is an area where the entertainment industry and the progressive movement have failed to move the dial. Most Americans will understand that destroying a potential human being, and I use that term because it is indisputable, is not a righteous act.Science has now established that human DNA is present on conception. So there really isn't much debate about it. If human life is sacrosanct and that's one of the pillars of the American Constitution, then abortion is a troubling situation unless, of course, there are drastic medical circumstances in play.So the progressives have not made many inroads when it comes to shutting down life. Same thing with the death penalty: 2001, 63 percent of Americans found it morally acceptable; 2015, 60 percent do. That's going down. Again, this goes back to the sanctity of life even if the person receiving the death penalty deserves the punishment.Talking Points opposes the state putting anyone to death. However, the punishment I would give heinous criminals would make them wish they were dead. They would be totally isolated in a hard labor facility.Finally, Americans are appalled socially by one act -- adultery. 2001, only 7 percent of Americans condoned marital affairs. 2015, just 8 percent do. That goes directly to the personal lives of Americans. Few who are married want to be betrayed, so all theory and politics fly right out that window. America is not France; when it comes to marital behavior, more than 90 percent of Americans want exclusivity.Gallup also did a poll on economic issues and here Americans are far more conservative. 39 percent of us say we are conservative when it comes to how the government runs the economy. Just 19 percent describe themselves as liberal in this arena. That's fascinating because we, the people, twice elected a man who believes that capitalism must be dramatically changed. Barack Obama is the most liberal president on economic issues the republic has ever had.Again, I think it goes back to understanding. Many Americans simply have not grasped Mr. Obama's overall political philosophy. They voted for him because of his charisma and his historic position as the first black man to achieve the White House.Going forward, talking points believes America is in for a big shock. I don't know how that shock is going to be delivered. But I do know we are heading in the wrong direction on just about every important issue and the polls back me up. Two thirds of Americans say the country is headed in the wrong direction. Whether it's another brutal terror attack here or an economic collapse of some kind, I cannot tell you.What I can say with certainty is that the public school system on the verge of collapse. Chaos in the minority precincts as bad as it's ever been. And the drive to legalize marijuana and other drugs will sap initiative and create millions of addicts. Also, our foreign policy is in an absolute shambles as we said last night.With all that in play, Americans are still evenly divided ideologically. But when the bill comes due, and something awful happens, this country will quickly snap back to traditional thinking.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight. New warnings of chaos and confusion in the race for the White House, with just nine days to go before the South Carolina primary. There is increased buzz today about the Republican contest possibly ending in a contested convention in July.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. With such a big field and voters so deeply divided. There are growing suggestions tonight that no single candidate will secure enough delegates by the summer, which would lead to a brokered or contested convention. Marco Rubio's team among those floating the idea with Senator Rubio himself sitting down with the Associated Press to discuss it saying, quote, ""I don't think it's necessarily negative the Clinton-Obama campaign went all 50 states and every territory. They didn't even wrap it up until June. Then they had all sort of uncertainty going into their convention. Whatever it is, we're prepared for it.""We have a big show for you tonight, including Charles Krauthammer who is here on the latest on the race for the White House. Plus, actor Richard Dreyfuss and his son are here with why Mr. Dreyfuss was at a Ted Cruz rally recently and the fallout. And Diane Sawyer of ABC News is here with a dramatic account of her exclusive interview with the mother of one of the Columbine killers who is speaking out for the first time in 17 years.But we begin with our chief Washington Correspondent James Rosen reporting from our D.C. Bureau on the drama surrounding the Republican nominee.  James?JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, the prospect of a brokered convention has loomed over the last few election cycles like Sasquatch, Fordibly (ph) Glimpse, discussed in earnest in frightful tones but something that never actually materializes. This year, however, some smart people are phoning in their sightings. Florida Senator Marco Rubio, as you were saying, licking his wounds from that disastrous debate performance and his fifth place finish in New Hampshire began telling reporters today, it's not necessarily a negative thing if the party's nomination battle goes all the way to July. Rubio campaign Manager Terry Sullivan was even more explicit telling the Associated Press this contest could, quote, ""Easily extends to the convention.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a message to donors saying stick with me and it's a message to Kasich and Bush saying, guess what, boys, I ain't getting out of that mainstream lane.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: But it's not just team Rubio sketching out these scenarios. Former New Hampshire Governor and Senator Judd Gregg, a backer of Jeb Bush in this cycle, said this week and I quote, if four people come out of South Carolina, we're headed into a brokered convention. The last time the Republicans held a brokered convention was in Kansas City in 1976 when incumbent President Gerald Ford eked out a first ballot victory over challenger Ronald Reagan. So what is a brokered convention, anyway? In simplest term, it's what happens when the primary process ends without any candidate amassing a majority of delegates.For the Republicans this year, that means 1,237 delegates. The last field of candidates this cycle. And the allocations of delegates on a proportional not winner take all basis. During the early balloting, up through mid-March has led many analyst to believe Sasquatch will finally emerge from the shadows. However, numerous interested parties presenting some very different profiles dismiss such talk.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SIMON ROSENBERG, PRESIDENT, NDN: If you're only getting five or ten percent in state after state after state, your money dries up. There's no way you can win. And the idea that all of them can stay funded and stay alive while not winning is just not the way politics works anymore.DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't see a convention, you know, where -- I don't see it. I don't see it. I don't see it. A lot of people talk about it but I don't see it.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: He doesn't see it. And neither does RNC Chairman Reince Priebus and notes the correct term is contested convention, as the back room big shots who wants brokered delegates votes, have been written out of existence by RNC rules -- Megyn.KELLY: James, thank you. Fascinating.ROSEN: You bet.KELLY: Joining us now with more, Ben Shapiro, editor-in-chief of Dailywire.com. Ben, so today Daniel Henninger in the Wall Street Journal wrote, ""It's hard for me to see where a round of brokering in Cleveland is not the most likely outcome."" This is a smart guy. Why would that be?  Why?BEN SHAPIRO, DAILYWIRE.COM EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: Well, the reason is because if you have at least three candidates in the race, all you need in order to get nominated is at least eight states. This is according to the new rules that were implemented back in 2012. You need eight states where you have a majority. You could easily have three candidates who each have a state and nobody with a majority. The problem is you just have too many candidates in this race and no consolidation, no win after New Hampshire. If the field doesn't go down after South Carolina and you still have three or four viable candidates, there's a very good shot actually that nobody has a majority of the delegates going into the Republican convention.KELLY: So if that happens, and the Republicans get to July, I think it's July 18th the convention starts and they don't have a nominee, they still have three guys or more, I assume it would just be three at that point, but who knows? Who does it benefit? Let's say it's the current frontrunners, it's Trump, it's Cruz, and maybe Rubio, who benefits?SHAPIRO: Well, you assume that Rubio would benefit from this because there's so many people on the establishment side who like Rubio and Rubio is sort of everybody second shop. But the reason it's called a brokered convention is because all of these candidates will then have the ability to basically tell their delegates, don't give your votes to somebody else unless somebody gives me something. So, the last time you had a truly brokered convention or somebody didn't win on the first ballot was 1948.KELLY: So, there's horse trading. So, if it were Trump, Cruz, and Bush or Trump, Cruz and Rubio, there's horse trading going on. The first vote goes on. Nobody gets a majority. Then they say, hey, look, I'm electable.  That is a situation in which it helps if they like you.SHAPIRO: It definitely helps if they like you. So this means that Ted Cruz has some real problem if we get to an open convention like this. In 1948, Earl Warren came from way behind to become the VP nominee specifically because he just gave enough votes to Thomas Dewey in order to -- for Dewey to get the nomination. You could see something similar happen. Let's say that Trump has the most delegates but he doesn't have enough to get the majority, you could see somebody like Marco Rubio theoretically said to Trump, OK, well, I'll put you over the top if you put me second on the ticket. You could even see theoretically, if Rubio and Cruz had enough combined, one of them goes and the other says, I'll throw my votes to you and you become presidential nominee, and I'll take the VP slot.KELLY: Unbelievable. Well, we'll continue to watch it. Because it doesn't get until March 15th where it's winner take all. Right now, the states could get some of their delegates and some of their delegates and then we get to a point where, it's winner takes all and then somebody presumably has ahead of his team and gets it going. It's great to see you, Ben.SHAPIRO: You, too.Joining me now with more on the potential for a long race ahead, Charles Krauthammer, a syndicated columnist, FOX News contributor and author of ""Things That Matter.""Charles, good to see you. So what do you think is the likelihood of there being a contested convention where no one has the majority of delegates when we get to July?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, right now I think it's fairly unlikely. And right now it's the dream of a few of the lagging candidates who figure they can't get the kind of run that would yield a majority of the delegates in time for the convention. What I think is so startling is how there's been this fight with mainly so-called main stream candidate lane for the one guy to emerge to challenge Trump. What they don't seem to understand, and this is cannibalism going on among the moderates, you don't normally associate cannibalism with moderates, is that by the time this one person supposedly emerges, it will be over and Trump will have swept the field or perhaps. Cruz will have come to be the one challenger who wins.KELLY: Uh-hm.KRAUTHAMMER: So I think there's a real danger of that, for the mainstream candidates, and right now, the most likely to emerge as the final -- the last man standing against Trump would be Ted Cruz.KELLY: Uh-hm. How important is South Carolina?KRAUTHAMMER: South Carolina may be one of the last chances for the field to be winnowed to the advantage of the mainstream or establishment candidates. If it is not, if you get say a Rubio and a Bush emerging and a Kasich, emerging fairly bunched together, I think that would be catastrophic for that lane for all of them. And would open it up to Cruz and to Trump.KELLY: And if Trump wins South Carolina?KRAUTHAMMER: If he wins it decisively, he becomes the prohibitive favorite. And then we've got -- if there were no -- if you don't see a winnowing of the field rapidly right after that so you are down to one or perhaps two challengers, he could run the table.KELLY: What is so fascinating about Trump is -- and Rush Limbaugh was making this point, that he's not ideological. You know, what Trump or Limbaugh was saying, he's not a Republican, but he's not a Democrat. He's not an ideologue at all. He was saying, if you are an ideologue, if you are going for the most conservative guy, you go for Cruz. Trump has got a sort of a different group. Limbaugh is saying his own words here. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: If conservatism is your bag, if conservatism is the dominating factor in how you vote, there is no other choice for you in this campaign than Ted Cruz. Because you are exactly -- this is the closest in our lifetimes we have ever been to Ronald Reagan.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Do you agree with that?KRAUTHAMMER: Well, I would disagree in the sense that I think Rubio is an authentic conservative. Now, Bush is kind of a reformist conservative.  All of them I think would be comparable to Reagan in 1980. You remember the issues were different in 1980. Immigration was not that big a deal.  On the spectrum, I think that they -- there are several candidates who are conservative.KELLY: Uh-hm.KRAUTHAMMER: But I do agree that trump is not a conservative. I think, you know, I mean, he would probably reject that, but I think the record would show he's a Trumpest. He's kind of a what the hellest, meaning, you know, these guys have not succeeded, as he said in a tweet I think today, you elected these guys to the Congress, they made the promises, they haven't kept them. And therefore, he's coming in to solve problems. And it's extremely idiosyncratic what he would do with healthcare. And he's not a traditional conservative. But the mood of the country and the electorate is that people may care a lot less about ideology than about results and he promises results.KELLY: Now, right now things are starting to get ugly in South Carolina and this is as we have been told. The cutting ads are coming out. Trump cut one against Cruz, which we're going to show, which he just pulled. We don't know why. Maybe he's trying to put more positive. Then Cruz cut one against Trump, which is rough. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Vera Coking's home was all she had left. But it stood in Donald Trump's way and the limousine parking lot he wanted for his casino. To him, she was a nobody. So Trump schemed with Atlantic City government to force Coking from her home using imminent domain.JOHN STOSSEL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: You're bullying these people out because --  TRUMP: This is the government case, this is not Donald Trump.STOSSEL: Yes. It is Donald Trump, it's you and your cronies government working together.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Public power. Private gain.TRUMP: I've offered her a lot of money --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He doesn't have no heart.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What kind of man talks from both sides of his mouth on amnesty for illegals on national television and still denies it? Who took more than a million dollars in sweetheart loans from Wall Street banks and fails to disclose it as required by law? Who runs a campaign accused of dirty tricks that tried to sabotage Ben Carson with false rumors? Ted Cruz, the worst kind of Washington Insider who just can't be trusted.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: What do you make of those?KRAUTHAMMER: Wow, that's pretty heavy stuff.KELLY: Right?KRAUTHAMMER: That's dropping all the ordinance out of all your airplanes on day one of the war. This is Pearl Harbor. A double Pearl Harbor.  Look, I think the Cruz ad is very interesting. Because it does two things.  Because it's an idealogical attack for conservatism. Imminent domain is a very resonate word. It's -- I mean, it's sort of our -- but everybody knows, it's the big government coming in and taking away your property for other purposes. And that is sort of a central idea opposing it, at least generally speaking and surely for private gain. Opposing it is a main tenant of conservatism. On the other side, what Trump was doing is hitting Cruz with all of the attacks he did in the debates the other week, and the ones that all the other candidates have leveled against Cruz. I think it's fair stuff. Obviously, you know, a little sharp. I don't think any of these two ads, either of the two ads is untrue. It's a question of what is the mood of the electorate. What do they care the most about?KELLY: Uh-hm. And the South Carolinians are apparently used to rough and tumble politics, so they may not be too offended by anything they saw there.KRAUTHAMMER: We'll sit back and enjoy and I don't think anybody will be calling a penalty for unnecessary roughness.(LAUGHTER)KELLY: Charles, always great to see you.KRAUTHAMMER: My pleasure.KELLY: Coming up, a Hollywood legend faces backlash after showing up at a Ted Cruz campaign event. His crime? Trying to be an informed American.  Tonight, Oscar winning actor Richard Dreyfuss and his son speak out to ""The Kelly File.""Plus, Ted Cruz's wife gives an interview and talks passionately about religion and politics. Some Cruz critics quickly label it as a rant and bizarre.Brian Kilmeade has the story making headlines. And a major new headache for Hillary Clinton. Just hours ago, we found out there is yet another investigation with ties to her under way. This one has to do with the Clinton Foundation during her time as secretary of state. And it comes just nine days out from the next big democratic showdown, the Nevada caucuses. Why she is now lowering expectations in that state. Marc Thiessen and Julie Roginsky are here. Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Developing tonight, an Oscar winning actor under fire for attending a Republican campaign event. Some on the left attacking actor Richard Dreyfuss after he was spotted at a Ted Cruz campaign rally just a few weeks back.Joining me now, Richard Dreyfuss and his son, Harry Dreyfuss. Harry was so incensed about the criticism that he wrote a post that's gone viral online.  So Harry, I start with you. So, people decided that your dad, a beloved actor, needed to be kicked out of Hollywood, and with things I cannot repeat on national television because they saw him at a Republican campaign event. Why did you write about it?HARRY DREYFUSS, WRITER AND PRODUCER: Well, so far my political expression has been limited to annoying Facebook rants. But when I saw that people were attacking my dad for his curiosity, it just -- it offended me on principle. And I thought, like, he has taught us that curiosity should be one of our highest values. And they made the mistake of thinking that him being there to see what Ted Cruz had to say that that meant he supported him.KELLY: Uh-hm.H. DREYFUSS: But really we should all so highly exalt the ability to go and listen to someone that you disagree with. So I wanted to -- I wanted to stick it to the people who thought that that was not a good thing to do.KELLY: Good for you. Sticking it to the people is always a good idea when the people are jerks. Richard, you said that some people felt betrayed.  You were raised -- apparently your mother was a socialist, you grandmother was a socialist, your great grandmother was a socialists. You are not a socialist, but you wanted to take in another viewpoint. Were you surprised at the backlash?RICHARD DREYFUSS, OSCAR-WINNING ACTOR: No, no. Because my other son, Ben, who is an editor for ""Mother Jones"" magazine, always warmed me never to read comments on the internet --KELLY: Right.R. DREYFUSS: -- because they were from people who were dropped on their heads.(LAUGHTER)H. DREYFUSS: That's true.KELLY: What were your impressions of Cruz?H. DREYFUSS: Well, I went to hear whether or not there would be a difference between what I was hearing through the TV camera and live. And what was disappointing is that there was no difference. They sounded equally kind of silly.KELLY: How about Glenn Beck, we have video of you meeting with Glenn. You sound actually a lot like Glenn Beck in some ways, because you both love the constitution.R. DREYFUSS: Well, name me someone who doesn't love the constitution.KELLY: A lot of people like to play fast and loose with it in today's day and age.R. DREYFUSS: Well, you know, we all feel that we know the constitution better than our neighbors. So -- I have my feelings about it and I've enjoyed listening to him, even though we don't agree on everything.KELLY: Uh-hm.R. DREYFUSS: And so when it came up to me that day, I was ripe. You know, I was ready to be talked to.KELLY: Uh-hm. And that's the thing that you're trying to get to, Harry, is that you think people are too dogmatic in this country today, that they adopt a party platform and once they've adopted it, they don't deviate on any issue, they're not open minded and that others paint them with a brush that may be totally off point.H. DREYFUSS: Isn't it odd that you think that it's just a coincidence that everybody who believes one thing about being liberal believes every other liberal idea?KELLY: Right. Like the entire party platform, every single piece? You don't deviate one thing?H. DREYFUSS: Yes. Exactly. And if you don't deviate, then that's just showing that you haven't thought about it, you've abdicated your responsibility.KELLY: Uh-hm. So did you make any conclusions, Richard, have you decided -- it doesn't sound like you're going to vote for Ted Cruz. Have you decided who you will support?R. DREYFUSS: No. I run a nonprofit initiative to bring the study of civics back to the grades below high school graduation.KELLY: All right. We're going to --R. DREYFUSS: If we don't know civics in this country, we are giving up knowledge of the greatest political revolution in the history of civilization.KELLY: Absolutely.R. DREYFUSS: And it is -- and it is deemed improper to know too much and we don't credit anyone for an answer to why we might be exceptional. If someone tells me that America is exceptional, my response is, if you don't defend that statement and prove it, I'll hit you right in the mouth because -- because people don't think that it needs defending and it does. People on the far right are always saying, we will expect you to love your country because it's South of Canada. And that's no reason.KELLY: And you've been somebody who has been out there saying that for some time. It's no wonder you got this way, Harry. It's great to meet you both. I can see your dad's pride in you. It's a pleasure to meet you.  Thank you both so much for being here.H. DREYFUSS: You too. Thank you.KELLY: By the way, if you have not seen Richard Dreyfuss in ABC's ""Madoff,"" which you can't get on ABC on demand, see it. He does an amazing job. Except you have to watch the commercials, which is kind of annoying.  But it was excellent. Notwithstanding. You can have the popcorn. Have a conversation.Coming up, a new campaign crisis tonight for Hillary Clinton. Yet another investigation is revealed. This one asking about the Clinton Foundation and what happened there while she was secretary of state. This as team Clinton begins to downplays expectations now in yet another state in which she was supposed to beat Bernie Sanders with ease. Marc Thiessen and Julie Roginsky are here.And it was one of the worst school shootings in our nation's history. Now for the very first time, the mother of one of the Columbine killers breaks her silence on the guilt, the warning signs, and whether she believes she raised a monster. ABC News Diane Sawyer is here in a ""Kelly File"" exclusive, with a remarkable interview.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All the kids and the teacher, and I keep thinking constantly how I would feel if it were the other way around.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Breaking tonight, days after the FBI officially confirms that it is investigating Hillary Clinton's use of a private e-mail server, yet another investigation into her activities is confirmed. This one by the State Department, which has subpoenaed her family's charitable group, namely the Clinton Foundation.Catherine Herridge, our chief intelligence correspondent has the report.  Catherine?CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, a rep for the Clinton Foundation confirming to FOX News that they got the subpoena last fall seeking documents about the charity's project and whether they required federal government approval. The subpoena also asks for records about long-time Clinton aide Huma Abedin who in 2012 held four different jobs working for the Clinton Foundation, Clinton's personal office, a State Department as well as an outside consulting firm tied to the Clintons. This on its face says the appearance of a conflict of interest. But late today on CNN, Clinton spokesman attacked State Department investigators.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: You're calling it that there's a sort of a plot inside the I.G., the Inspector General's office at the State Department to get Hillary Clinton?BRIAN FALLON, PRESS SECRETARY, CLINTON CAMPAIGN: All I know is that they have mounted several fishing expeditions style investigations since she decided to run for president, there is no basis to any of them. And I think that it's intended to created headwinds for her campaign. It's not going to work.(END VIDEO CLIP)HERRIDGE: The foundation says, the State Department investigation is squarely focused on Clinton's aide and not her. Though, there's no way to know who is really under scrutiny. The Washington Post broke this story and it seems to track with the story first reported by Fox News that the FBI probe into Clinton's use of private e-mail, a secretary of state had expanded to public corruption and ties between the State Department and foundation. At the time, Clinton dismissed the report, even though she must have already known about the foundation's subpoena.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's an unsourced, irresponsible, you know, claim that has no basis and it is something that really is without merit and should not have any influence whatsoever in this nominating process.(END VIDEO CLIP)HERRIDGE: And today, a federal judge give the State Department until the end of the month to release the remaining 3,700 Clinton e-mails. And that's no question more contain classified information and some are likely too damaging to National Security to release in any form -- Megyn.  KELLY: Wait a minute, Catherine, just to go back. So, that -- you referenced back to that sound like of her. That was the day you reported that there was an inquiry into the Clinton Foundation that they had been subpoenaed and that was her respond to your report because I remember they're saying.HERRIDGE: Right, right.KELLY: .it was unsourced, it was irresponsible, it was a claim without basis, it didn't have merit that's the things that was just confirmed today?HERRIDGE: No. To be clear, we reported that the FBI investigation had two tracks, the e-mail and also the public corruption. When she was asked about that line of inquiry, she dismissed it at that time even though she knew that was a line of inquiry that the state department was investigating.KELLY: Fascinating. Catherine, thank you.HERRIDGE: You're welcome.KELLY: So those revelations come as the former secretary of state campaign is being called out for trying to downplay its standing. In the upcoming primary in Nevada, the caucus is there. One political reporter there is calling a ""fear of Bernie Sanders,"" ""I don't smell a rat. I smell something more pungent from the Clinton campaign, fear."" Joining me now Marc Thiessen, former Chief Speechwriter to President George W. Bush and Julie Roginsky, Democratic Analyst and also a Fox News contributor, good to see you both.JULIE ROGINSKY, DEMOCRATIC ANALYST: Nice to see you.MARC THIESSEN, FORMER CHIEF SPEECHWRITER TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Nice to see you, Megyn.KELLY: So, all right -- so, there's two things here. The Clinton Foundation is being investigated that they received a subpoena and on top of that, now suddenly Nevada maybe in jeopardy for her, at least they're trying to suggest that it is. We don't know which one is the truth. Mark you take that.THIESSEN: Well, I mean first of all she had a near-death experience in Iowa, she got trounced in New Hampshire by 22 points and now in Nevada a state that in December poll showed she was winning 19 points, they're suddenly downplaying their chances for success.So, I think the Clinton campaign is reeling and she says this email investigation -- all this investigation should have no impact on the political campaign. The reality is they are having an impact on the political campaign. And she has an honesty problem among democrats.If you look at the exit polls in New Hampshire, 50 percent of democratic primary voters said she is not honest or trustworthy. Honesty was the number one issue ahead of electability, ahead of values, ahead of everything, and those voters who said that honesty was the number one issue voted 92 to 6 for Bernie sanders.That's without him even raising this as an issue. So this is having a massive -- those are stunning members. This is having a massive effect on her campaign and it's going to continue to haunt her.KELLY: Julie, if you extrapolate that, you know, that number that found her dishonest and said it's actually really important to them to the greater electorate, you're talking about a few million voters. I mean that could make a big difference in the general election.ROGINSKY: Yes, it certainly can. Look, I mean there's no question that she's got issues that she needs to address starting first and foremost with the lack of message which is something that before we get to the honesty factor we have to get to reason to actually why she's even running and I'm not so sure.(CROSSTALK)ROGINSKY: .I did.(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)ROGINSKY: .it's 9 o'clock at night -- a little French I know.THIESSEN: (UNTRANSLATED), Julie.ROGINSKY: Thank you. Thanks, Marc. But look I mean she really needs to see the reason as to why she is running. Bernie sanders has articulated his reason very well, you may agree or disagree with it. He's been very clear about the fact that income and equality is the reason that he's in this race. She's been kind of all over the map and so therefore I think there are reasons for her as to why she's not doing well in addition to the reason that you just stated.You know, as far as the Nevada lowering of expectations and maybe just that and maybe that they are lowering expectations so that she can certainly come in with a huge victory if she doesn't win and say, ""Well, look you know, this is really a tough race but I was able to make it a big race and I was able to make it big win for myself"".KELLY: Yes.(CROSSTALK)ROGINSKY: Her campaign is coming out and saying you know it's 80 percent white, right than Nevada is 80 percent white.THIESSEN: Yes.ROGINSKY: .and he does better, Bernie does better in states that are mostly white but it's not 80 percent white.THIESSEN: No, it's not. In fact, Jon Ralston who is the expert on Nevada Politics by Partisan he says that the democratic electorate is expected to be 40 percent minorities. So why is Hillary Clinton lowering expectation that she's going to lose in that state is because she wants to be able to dismiss Nevada as another white state than Bernie Sanders unlike Iowa and New Hampshire?(CROSSTALK)THIESSEN: .or keeps the tied in and so if he does well in Nevada, it shows that he can win among minorities that's bad news for her going in to the south.KELLY: Wow, fascinating discussion. Thank you panel.ROGINSKY: Thanks.THIESSEN: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: Coming up, the mascot gets arrested mascot I would say for disobeying Sharia law. Look at this picture. Where it happened and why it's sparking major backlash tonight. Brian Kilmeade is here on that and other things. And for the first time on television, the mother of one of the Columbine killers breaks her silence after 17 years. What she says happened inside her home leading up to the attack and the warning she has for every parent. She sat down with ABC's Diane Sawyer and tonight Diane is here with an exclusive preview, don't miss this.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Part of the shock of this was that learning that what I believed and how I lived and how I parented was an invention in my own mind, that it was a completely different world that he was living in.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: And on Kelly File Exclusive, nearly 17 years ago, the nation was shaken to its core by one of the worst school shootings in our history. Two teenage boys, hell bent on destruction entered Colorado's Columbine High School and murdered 13 innocent people, 12 of them their fellow classmates, the other a beloved teacher.By the time it was all over, two dozen more had been injured in this attack and the rest of the school was left horrified by what they had just witnessed. As for the two gunmen, they took their own lives.And now for the very first time on television, the mother of one of the killers is ready to break her silence speaking exclusively to ABC's Diane Sawyer. Watch.SUE KLEBOLD, MOTHER OF COLUMBINE SHOOTER: Part of the shock of this was that learning that what I believed and how I lived and how I parented was an invention in my own mind, that it was a completely different world that he was living in.DIANE SAWYER, ABC NEWS ANCHOR: She says not a day goes by she doesn't think of the victims and their families.KLEBOLD: I just remember sitting there and reading about them -- all these kids, the teacher. And I keep thinking constantly that how I would feel if it were the other way around and one of their children had shot mine. I would feel exactly the way they did, I know I would. I know I would.KELLY: ABC News Anchor, Diane Sawyer joins me now to discuss her exclusive and eye opening interview with Sue Klebold. Diane good to see you.SAWYER: It's good to see you here.KELLY: After all this time, 17 years she breaks her silence and finally goes on camera to talk about this. Just in the clip we saw there, you can see the overwhelming guilt. What was your takeaway?SAWYER: Bringing shattering lessons learned over so much time and so much regret and so much distance and of course the victim's families their unsurpassed grief. And she said to herself, what can I do except how you want to miss and hope somebody else doesn't miss it.KELLY: That's the crux of it because every parent wonders what were the signs -- what was there that she didn't see?SAWYER: She has a magnifying glass out on her life and that's one of the reasons she's been writing this for years because she wanted to go over everything...KELLY: Because she's writing a book.(CROSSTALK)SAWYER: She is writing a book called, ""A Mother's Reckoning,"" and reckoning is a very big word in her life right now. And I think one of the thing that will stun you is you're going to go back and see her journals that she was writing and she was writing it in the summer that he was also writing journals, and she's writing about adolescent phases, adolescent phases -- she's writing about his happy times -- he is writing about suicidal depression. He is writing about not being able to go on. He is writing about the fact that he will never find happiness in his life so what is the point?KELLY: She didn't see it?SAWYER: She says that -- and this is we've talked to all the experts on this. Adolescents are better at hiding depression than adults are because stigma is so great. They don't get to be different. They can hide it and she wrote what she didn't see often. She's going to take you through this, adolescent depression and we have everybody watching it so far inside ABC News saying, what am I doing at home? Is there something more profound?KELLY: Was there something -- we like to believe as parents that these parents must have been weird, they must have been bad like they -- because we don't want to believe, right? So, was there something about her that jumped out -- did she seem like a normal parent?SAWYER: I think when you see her, everyone's first reaction is the same, that's not what I thought she was going to be like, that's not what I thought she was going to look like. So, you know what, the thing -- you have to remember and then we all have to keep remembering it was 17 years ago who knew about this incredible adolescent depression every 95 minutes a young person dies...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: This was the first big one that put this problem on the map.SAWYER: Yes.KELLY: This temporary America.SAWYER: It was in so many ways and then of course I want to be clear about this adolescent depression -- suicidal depression is not the pathway to violence. That is something different. And she also has to look at that crossroad.KELLY: Does she know how it crossed over from one to the other?SAWYER: You know, she is examining every part of it, so are the experts examining it with us. Of course, Eric Harris was his friend.KELLY: Yes.SAWYER: .he had a friend.KELLY: The other killer.SAWYER: .the other killer was there. And this convergence of the two of them is one of the things we really, really want to study. I will say one thing that I think parents at home were going to be debating big after this, do you respect privacy? Do you ransack the room? And it's going to be a big factor coming up in the section in which she tries to deal with this part.KELLY: She wrote years ago about thinking back on her child, and in her words.SAWYER: Yes.KELLY: .the monster he became...SAWYER: Right.KELLY: .and then the child again. What does that mean? What did she mean by that?SAWYER: You know, she goes from staring as a child as she dreamed he would be to staring at the murderer he became. And in her heart, she cannot let go of the child she loved so much that she always thought he might be.KELLY: She said one time, she said very little, but she did write a piece ten years after the shooting saying he left that morning and just said bye, that's it.SAWYER: Right.KELLY: And that she concluded he must not have loved me, given what he did. Is that -- is she still in that place?SAWYER: I think she's very much in bewilderment about the mysteries of that and that is one of them. And there is a tape that ends with this saying, ""Hey, mom got to go."" And it's addressed to her and so she's living in this incredible contradiction. And you will see this as she goes back and forth and struggles to grapple with who he really was at which times and what she missed and blamed herself for forever.KELLY: Wow. It's tomorrow night Friday night at 10:00 pm on ABC News and again it takes a look at school shootings, mental health, and the status of America when it comes to warning signs and what we should be looking for in our kids. Diane, thank you so much.SAWYER: Thank you.KELLY: Again, tomorrow night 10:00 pm on ABC, incredible. Coming up, Ted Cruz's wife speaks out passionately about her faith. Find out who then quickly labeled her thoughts a rant and bizarre. And if you had to pick a celebrity look alike for Brian Kilmeade, Eric Bolling, and yours truly who would you pick? Believe it or not, Joe Concha did a survey and he has some answers. Brian Kilmeade will tell us what they are. Next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Well, Senator Cruz's wife, Heidi Cruz, gave a radio interview and spoke about her faith. Cue the accusations of how bizarre her ""rant"" was.HEIDI CRUZ, SENATOR TED CRUZ WIFE: We are at a cultural cross road in our country then if we can be in this race to show this country the face of the God that we serve -- this Christian God that we serve -- is the foundation of our country. Our country was built on Judeo-Christian values. We are a nation of freedom of religion but the God of Christianity is the God of freedom, of individual liberty, of choice and of consequence.KELLY: Brian Kilmeade is the co-host of Fox & Friends and author of the big bestseller, Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates. There, thank you, James (ph).UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.KELLY: So, she's a freak according to some because she made that statement.BRIAN KILMEAD, CO-HOST, ""FOX & FRIENDS"": Right. I have never heard something so excoriating, so out of line as Heidi Cruz defending her husband and his faith in saying that I would work for him if I wasn't married to him and that our country -- the country feels in crisis in citing religion. And then they go on to say that someone Thomas Jefferson they had in mind -- Jefferson envisioned the wall of separation between church and state. He's not judging says Ken Myer of Mediaite. He's not judging. He just thinks people who disagree are wrong and bad. I didn't get that out of that statement. I've heard it two, three or four times, I see the reaction. I'm a little stunned by it.KELLY: Can I tell you just picking up on the last segment we did with Diane Sawyer. It is -- it is literally now the point in our country where our children have to go do practice drills where they hide inside the bathrooms.KILMEADE: Yes.KELLY: .at their preschools because they might get shot. But if their teacher says a prayer when they're in there, she can get fired. I mean, that's the place we're at right now in 2016 America.KILMEADE: I agree with you and the blowback on this is bizarre and I get it's unsettling but let's take the callous approach and look at South Carolina and let's see how this plays in South Carolina where in terms to vote who gets into office.KELLY: But the.KILMEADE: .in South Carolina.KELLY: .the separation of church and state is understood by the founders and by regular Americans is nowhere near as vigilant as unforgiving as some in this country are now arguing. There is room for some expression of faith.KILMEADE: There always has been and Ted Cruz goes on to say that Judeo Christian values are -- it just say they do not make up the constitution or the founding fathers in their school of thought is a historical revisionism, they would downplay the role of Christianity faith in Judeo- Christian values.It's been there, it is there yet we continue to debate it there. But the bottom line is when you go into the voting booth when you decide to caucus, whatever you decide to do, pretty much America is making their decision to sign more with the so-called, crazy Heidi Cruz and Ted Cruz.And especially in South Carolina where they seem to make their own decisions and they're in this finest hour and they're deciding.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: .even angelical. All right, let's move on to something else. Something weird happened with the mascot. What was it?KILMEADE: Well, it was really simple. In Saudi Arabia, there was a little bit of a problem. They have the Saudi Arabian committee for the promotion of virtue and the prevention of vice and they cracked down on that mascot and you can see why.KELLY: What kind of mascot is that?KILMEADE: That is a mascot celebrating the launching of a brand new candy shop young lady.KELLY: Okay.KILMEADE: And that sweet shop, it's big news in the capital of Riyadh, but there's something wrong with that mascot. There is no veil. And because there is no veil, it's a violation of the virtue code. Therefore, he -- he is a guy dressed as a woman, ended up in the back of the squad car because it's a violation of Sharia law.KELLY: Come on.KILMEADE: If you, you know, if you let one mascot go, they're all going to go crazy. I mean we've been over this. It's unbelievably.KELLY: Cover yourself. Wait, got to get to this quickly, doppelgangers -- Joe Concha in Mediaite -- so me, I'm sorry, it took a hit and you got promoted in the same segment.KILMEADE: Right.KELLY: .doppelgangers, let's see a couple of them. Let's see -- who do we have first?KILMEADE: Who looks alike and the first one would be.KELLY: Oh.KILMEADE: .this is Megyn Kelly.KELLY: My long hair.KILMEADE: And one of the people from.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Elsa.KILMEADE: So, that's Elsa.KELLY: Of course, I can see. Who do we have next?KILMEADE: That is Eric -- then you see Eric Bolling and David Hasselhoff.KELLY: Oh, very nice.KILMEADE: Now, I asked the people of Twitter who I look like and I came up overwhelmingly with this.KELLY: Let's see. Stand by. The drama.KILMEADE: Oh, no. That's something.(CROSSTALK)KILMEADE: That's Anderson Cooper.KELLY: .but that's pretty good.KILMEADE: Yes, that's Anderson Cooper, that's somebody else.(LAUGHTER)KELLY: Let's see.(LAUGHTER)KILMEADE: Will Smith, that's pretty much -- it's pretty overwhelming, John Ringer. I oftentimes get tables in restaurants because I was.KELLY: I can see some resemblance there.KILMEADE: Right.KELLY: .like maybe the ears.KILMEADE: You have to adjust your set, but if you have to.(CROSSTALK)KILMEADE: .keep to the side I mean, it's very obvious, I think. So both -- we both will be at the Oscars.KELLY: It's great to see you.KILMEADE: Right. Great to see you.KELLY: Brian Kilmeade everybody. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: So who do you think your doppelganger is, let us know at facebook.com/thekellyfile and follow me on Twitter @megynkelly and do you think in the next, ""Frozen"" movie Elsa should cut her hair?

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Good evening, everyone, and welcome to a ""Kelly File"" special, ""What is ailing America?"" I'm Megyn Kelly.With the 2016 race for the White House getting under way, we are hearing more and more about what's wrong in America and in need of being fixed. From the economy and jobs, to race relations and poverty, from distrust of some media, to disgust with some political leaders. Tonight we take it all on, and we start with a remarkable story shaping up right now tonight on the campaign trail. It is now been almost five weeks since Hillary Clinton declared that she is running for president, and she has yet to do a single major media interview. How many times have we had to say it?She's not answered questions about her e-mail scandal, that plot thickens tonight, I have that for you in moments, her charitable foundation, her support for the Iraq war, her record as secretary of state, and tonight we add something new, there is breaking news that Hillary and Bill Clinton have earned a combined $25 million in just the last year, but giving roughly 100 speeches, that's a lot of money per speech. And another $5 million for Mrs. Clinton's book. Thirty million at least from a candidate who is complaining about income inequality. The -- reporter asked her about that. And so far she is wildly unavailable to answer any questions about any of it.Trace Gallagher has put together the developing details on the ""Clinton Cash"" windfall, he's got that for us now. Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, we just got Hillary Clinton disclosure form 15 minutes ago and are now kind of scanning the Clinton's various assets, we know that Hillary Clinton commands up to $200,000 per speech, Bill Clinton up to $700,000, and we have confirmed that from those 100 speeches you talked about, the Clintons took in $25 million over just the past 16 months. Add the $25 million to the $5 million that Hillary Clinton made in her book ""Hard Choices"" and the Clintons already make more than 99.9 percent of the population. The Clintons also listed the number of security investments and life insurance policies worth millions more.Now, remember, Hillary Clinton does not have to disclose personal assets like homes, cars, or federal retirement plans, and other assets in stocks and companies only have to be disclosed within a broad range, not specific numbers. Experts say the disclosure forms are intended to guard against conflicts of interest or potential conflicts. They are not meant to establish a candidate's net worth. Although, the Clintons wealth will certainly come up in the campaign, considering she is positioning herself as a champion for the struggling middle class. The Clintons are clearly moving up the financial ladder, as well. In her last disclosure before she left the State Department, Hillary Clinton declared that she and her husband had made at least $16.7 million in 2012, that, of course, was before she hit the speaking circuit.The Clintons' effective federal tax rate in 2014 was 30 percent, that tax information, by the way, is not part of the financial disclosure form, but the Clintons are clearly trying to get the information out there as a way of pointing out that they pay taxes on earned income, not invested income, though the Clintons have been criticized for giving highly paid speeches for key players in the financial industry, Hillary Clinton, by the way, claims they were dead broke when they left the White House in 2001, the same year they made roughly $12 million -- Megyn.KELLY: Wow. Trace, thank you.In poll after poll, when Americans are asked what ails America, their number one complaint is dissatisfaction with government and this Clinton controversy captures some of that. As she continues to dodge the media week after week, the poll show a growing number of voters think she is dishonest. And remember, as we get these reports about her income, Mitt Romney talked with reporters all the time and he was still repeatedly hammered on the tiniest of his financial details.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: When you say you left Bane to run the Olympics, why was your name still on these documents and why didn't you clear this up sooner? Weren't you concerned at some point that these filings would become public and people would see that your name is still on these filings?UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Miss Cotter (ph) suggested you might be guilty of a felony, Governor Romney, what is your response to that?UNIDENTIFIED MAN: When are you going to release more of your taxes and how many years?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, Fox News digital politics editor Chris Stirewalt. You know, I guess to quote Harry Reid, Romney didn't win, did he?CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: He didn't. And that interview he looked like he'd rather be taking a beating from Evander Holyfield than sitting there and talking about that, but he did it, just like Jeb Bush stood out in the hallway in Reno, Nevada, and let people pelt him with stones.KELLY: Sat with me for a lengthy interview, took every question I gave him, even though he was at risk to himself.STIREWALT: Yes. I think I heard something about that one. In fact, the reality is, for politicians, of course they don't want to answer questions, of course they don't want to be obliging and Hillary Clinton has demonstrated that she's pioneering a new way to run for president, or maybe it's a really old way to run for president, which is you don't run at all, you stand for office. You clear the way, you have wealthy friends, you have influential people, you have control of a party apparatus that is tightly held and you don't even run. You just stand and you say, I'm here, and I am prepared to be your president and you just make sure nobody gets in your way. And that's not exactly progressive.KELLY: It's not just wealthy friends, obviously, the Clintons have a lot of dough, and it averages out to about $250,000 a speech, these speeches, you know, 20 minutes long, some of them. So, must have been a hell of a speech, must be like a real --STIREWALT: It's really good.KELLY: Right?STIREWALT: Magic tricks.KELLY: Here we go! And then I met a young intern -- seriously, like what could he possibly be talking about that is worth in some cases $500,000? I realize he was president of the United States, but what I've been told he likes to talk about his charitable foundation, which I'm sure is wonderful. But I don't know if I'd pay him half a million dollars to talk about that for half an hour. The question I have for you, however is you have a piece today that talks about how you reap what you sow, press corps, and what we're looking at right now with Hillary's campaign is the Obama White House press strategy on steroids. Explain that.STIREWALT: That's right. Because what Hillary Clinton has done is, if you can't beat them, hire them. So, she has hired to her all of the people, a lot of the people who helped defeat her in 2008 and their strategy, which is don't answer questions, don't have actual interactions with people, do YouTube videos, do over the heads of the press, don't interact and just put this sort of canned goods out there. I called it spam, where you just push it out there and say this is what it is, and when reporters say, we want to talk to you, we want this, say I'm talking to the lady that eats the fruit loops in the bathtub, and I'm not talking to you and that's what you do.And Hillary Clinton is taking it to the next logical steps. She just as politicians always do, the first one makes it bad, the next one makes it worse. Hillary Clinton is giving the press what they asked for, which is by not getting up on their hind legs and barking loudly about Barack Obama shutting them out, lying to them on some occasions, and generally disrespecting them. Now they find themselves without the ability to apply any leverage to Hillary Clinton and she's given them a big --KELLY: I like that, right. If I ever get to interview her, I hope she begins the interview that way. And I'm rubber, you're glue.STIREWALT: Exactly.KELLY: I'll work on it before the interview. So she sees a proven media strategy and she pursues it. I'm not going to say anything, I don't care, I'm not answering your questions.STIREWALT: Right.KELLY: But more and more questions continue to arise and eventually, eventually she will sit with somebody, she will. And just tonight we had more questions raised about her e-mails, do we have the sound bites asking my -- okay, listen to this, the former deputy head of the CIA came out, he spoke with Hugh Hewitt today, Mike Morell, and talked about the likelihood of Mrs. Clinton's e-mail server being hacked and accessed by foreign governments. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HUGH HEWITT, TALK SHOW HOST: As a professional matter, do you believe that at least one or perhaps many foreign intelligence servers, services, have everything that went to and from that server?MIKE MORELL, FORMER CIA DEPUTY DIRECTOR: So, I think that foreign intelligence services, the good ones, have everything on any unclassified network that the government use, whether it's a private server or a public one. They are that good.HEWITT: So that's a yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: And his counterpart over at the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, told me about a month and a half ago he also believes that the Chinese at least and others have likely hacked into that server. So, somebody is going to have to ask her about that at some point.STIREWALT: And if you're covering Hillary Clinton and you're not putting it all through the prism of this, you're doing it wrong. Until she answers the questions, she doesn't deserve coverage on whatever narrative gobbledygook that she and every other politician would like to put out every day, she has to answer things about what matters first before she gets to put her spin out.KELLY: Right. Otherwise the press just continues its co-dependency - -STIREWALT: You got it.KELLY: -- which you outlined very nicely. It's great to see you, Mr. Stirewalt.STIREWALT: You bet.KELLY: Just wanted to try it out, that's kind of fun, it's Friday night.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone and Happy Thanksgiving. I'm Dana Perino along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Eric Bolling and a mystery guest man, if may, Gutfeld. It is 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""Today, America, we are very thankful to be with you tonight and our especially thankful for our troops and our veterans on this holiday. Thank you for your service and your sacrifice. We've got a fun show ahead, so let's get started. It's become one of our annual traditions here on The Five to name our picks for turkeys of the year. It makes me a little uncomfortable. But as always, a ton of options we needed to weed through, but we managed to make our selections and we're going to take it around the table. We're going to start with Kimberly. Who did you pick?KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Oh, I think I have the best turkey ever. You might agree with me at home. It's Bernie Sanders. Hurray for Bernie turkey Sanders because he says that black lives matter instead of all lives matter. For promoting socialism and for saying that climate change is the greatest threat to our national security. Roll it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're going to explain what democratic socialism is and what democratic socialism is about is saying that it is immoral and wrong that the top 1/10th of 1 percent in this country own and almost 90 percent. Black lives matter. We need to combat institutional racism from top to bottom. Climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism and if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you're doing to see countries all over the world. This is what the CIA says. They're going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops and you will gonna see all kinds of international conflict.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: You know what's funny K.G.?GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: You said you chose him as your turkey of the year. There's another cable network that would probably say he's their candidate of the year using those exact same clips.GUILFOYLE: Absolutely. But I would like to thank Bernie Sanders for giving us Larry David. That has been the best thing about his candidacy is Larry David on ""Saturday Night Live."" But honestly, this election is about the choices. So if this is your guy, you know, know who he is, understand that it will send this country back to the dark ages. It's problematic, but you know, you can enjoy the humor of it kind of along the way. I'm being positive (inaudible).PERINO: Anybody else wants to comment on Bernie?GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Well, the funny thing about Bernie Sanders is that people view him as a revolutionary. But when you listen to him, he just covers the exact -- it ticks every single box of the traditional left winger. So he's not rebelling against anything in the media, he's not rebelling against anything in academia and he is certainly not rebelling against anything in government. He's playing the exact same tune of every liberal progressive. There's nothing rebellious except his hair.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, you know it's interesting as I thought Dana's point was on target. That in fact, there are lots of people who love Bernie Sanders, and I, even as someone who is a democrat, I got to tell you, I'm amazed because a socialist?GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: I mean, I understand. I'm OK. So he's strong on guns, you know, he's -- he wants gun and he said that he wants to hike taxes, which Hillary Clinton is attacking and saying, ""Oh, my God, this guy is going to raise your taxes."" But none of it matters. Their people -- I mean you go to a Bernie Sanders event, you will be stunned. Not only by the turnout, but the passion that people, populist passion that I think is reflected on the right by the Trump types.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Or.WILLIAMS: But it's just amazing how much people love Bernie Sanders.BOLLING: Or -- and can we talk about who the people are that are showing up on Bernie Sanders?WILLIAMS: Yeah. Go ahead. Sure, go right ahead.BOLLING: They are young people.WILLIAMS: Well, no. There are a lot of people in Birkenstocks.BOLLING: They are very -- well, right. So they are very young people and we've talked about liberal academia who pushed this liberal stuff, the socialist stuff all the time. And what does Bernie say is, OK, you learned it school and I will give it to you in live.WILLIAMS: No, no. But what I was saying.BOLLING: We'll transfer all the money -- 90 percent, we'll tax over its 90, up to 90 percent. And look at all these programs we're going to offer you, vote for me. I mean, it's a brilliant strategy.WILLIAMS: Yeah, I know. I was talking about old hippies.PERINO: And Juan, guess what?BOLLING: All them, too.WILLIAMS: Yes.PERINO: As on old hippie.WILLIAMS: Yeah.PERINO: Just kidding.WILLIAMS: Oh.PERINO: You get to go next.WILLIAMS: I get to go next? Oh my, gosh. Thanksgiving, you know, this is a time when you look for a big, big, big turkey. There's no bigger turkey than Rolling Stone. I mean, as a journalist, you look at Rolling Stone, you think how could they go through a process -- not only a reporting, writing, editing, and publishing without ever stopping to say, hey, is this right? Did this really happen? Does someone have some corroboration? Have the cops been called? Do we have somebody on the record saying this happened? Oh, no? Turkey like cluck, cluck, cluck (inaudible).GUILFOYLE: Oh it's not. Wow.PERINO: You have really high expectations for journalism -- kidding. I agree with you.GUTFELD: Yeah, the reason why that happened is if you want a story to be true, you're willing to overlook the facts. That's Rolling Stone.WILLIAMS: Well that's.GUTFELD: They wanted.WILLIAMS: They have a political agenda.GUTFELD: Yeah. They wanted the story to be true.BOLLING: Let's start with the title of the story.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: We'll work backwards.GUTFELD: Backwards, exactly.PERINO: But has it hurt Rolling Stone?GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: The circulation like that.GUTFELD: Oh, yes.GUILFOYLE: I think so. And the reputation and the brand have been damaged (inaudible).PERINO: And they're being sued, right?WILLIAMS: They're being sued.GUILFOYLE: Lawsuits.PERINO: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Pleading out, it's not a good situation.GUTFELD: They're gonna.GUILFOYLE: Happy Thanksgiving.GUTFELD: They're gonna have to do a revamp, a complete do over to make people forget about this.PERINO: All right, Eric, you're next.BOLLING: Did they worked, those revamps? Like Gawker went from a really wacky site, now they want to be politics?GUTFELD: Well, Details are shutting down so.BOLLING: So when they say, let's pick the turkey of the year, there are so many options. You go file back through the year and try to figure out who was the biggest turkey, and it didn't take long for me to come up with this one. Quentin Tarantino and his attack on cops, listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)QUENTIN TARANTINO, FILM DIRECTOR: I am a human being with a conscience. And when I see murder I cannot stand by. And I have to call the murdered the murdered and I have to call the murderers the murderers.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right.BOLLING: What a turkey. Honestly, and then he even doubled down on it. He had other people joining the fight. I actually included black lives matter also.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: In that fight -- in my turkey of the year for whatever reason you want to call it. But look, these people risk their lives -- in five minutes on the job, risk more than we will all year long or all our lifetime long and him -- for him to say that, it's absolutely ludicrous. Turkey. You're a turkey, Quen.GUTFELD: I would call him a turkey if you replaced key with the letter D.WILLIAMS: Oh, it's not edible.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Oh my, gosh.PERINO: OK.WILLIAMS: You know why you think he's turkey, Eric? Because, you know, let's put aside the politics of it, I thought it was totally self-serving. I thought that.GUTFELD: True.WILLIAMS: He was doing had everything to do with one, pushing his movie, and two, apologizing.GUTFELD: Absolutely.WILLIAMS: For Django.GUILFOYLE: Django Unchained.WILLIAMS: And then Spike Lee has got involved, and I thought it was all about him and not about the social cause.BOLLING: People -- a lot of people say stupid things and they fix them later. And then we see it all over the place. Either fix, the fix or fix -- he didn't. He stayed with it.PERINO: And the other way -- on way he did it was to rub a spot on the wall, which makes it worse.GUILFOYLE: Oh.PERINO: In case you catch any kids doing that.GUILFOYLE: Don't do that.PERINO: With the crayon.GUTFELD: Don't rub the spot.PERINO: I have one. Did you want to hear mine?GUTFELD: Sure.PERINO: I mean, Greg.GUTFELD: What?PERINO: It is a family show and a family oriented.GUTFELD: What are you talking about?PERINO: All right. We have another one and it's my choice. It is the CNBC moderators at the GOP debates. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN HARWOOD, CNBC CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Is this a comic book version of a presidential campaign?CARL QUINTANILLA, CNBC ANCHOR: You have been a young man in a hurry, ever since you won your first election in your 20s.HARWOOD: Is that why you're having a difficult time in this (inaudible)?QUINTANILLA: Does it not speak to your vetting process or judgment in any way?HARWOOD: You're the champion of Americans living paycheck to paycheck.Leading republican candidate, when you look at the average of national polls right now is Donald Trump. When you look at him, do you see someone with the moral authority to unite the country?(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: And I'm not the only one who thought they were a turkey. Look at the reaction from mainstream media.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CAROL COSTELLO, CNN NEWS ANCHOR: Perhaps the biggest loser in last night's debate wasn't any one candidate, but CNBC. What is this, a high school debate?ANDERSON COOPER, CNN AC360 SHOW HOST: Some of these moderators, they're -- they didn't even -- they didn't have the quotes to back up what they were saying.TOM BROKAW, NBC NEWS SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT: Moderators, you know, are all like children. They should be seen, but not heard.BRIAN STELTER, CNN'S SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: When you hear the audience booing the moderators, you know you're in a tough spot.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: So that's why they were my turkey this year, everyone does agree?GUILFOYLE: That's a really good choice.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Totally agree with that. In fact, there was an NBC clip in there in the middle of that. Did you notice?PERINO: Yes. And we can have leftovers for days.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: On that turkey.GUILFOYLE: And by the way, it was very unfortunate for CNBC was the juxtaposition with FBN crushing it. That was not good for them. Like, how do you it? Go back to like puppies school.PERINO: And we are all about two weeks away from the next debate on December 15th.GUTFELD: I can't wait.PERINO: Can you do your turkey?GUTFELD: Yes, I will. My turkey, there's been a lot of media coverage on my turkey. Let's roll that montage.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LESTER HOLT, NBC NIGHTLY NEWS ANCHOR: There's an alert about your thanksgiving turkey.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS CHIEF ANCHOR: Everybody gets so daunted by the idea of the big turkey.DAVID MUIR, ABC NEWS ANCHOR: Tonight, where turkey might cost you more a rise up to 20 cents per pound this year.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Pan fried turkey, it is so good.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do turkey bacon at Thanksgiving.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you want to get really cool.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There will still be turkeys, but you might have to pay.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: It's like every single year this happens around this time.GUILFOYLE: How weird.GUTFELD: Everybody starts talking about turkey. I am so tired of this white meat privilege, OK?GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.GUTFELD: It is just ridiculous. It is totally alienating and it's always the bigger, the better, oh, do you have a 12 pound, a 14 pound? What kind of message is that sending to children, that the bigger the turkey, the better it is? That's the reason why kids are getting fat these days is because we're glorifying obese white turkeys. I'm tired of fat white turkeys. Juan, I'm tired of fat white turkeys.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.GUILFOYLE: Sounds like you need some dark meat in your life.BOLLING: Exactly.WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: I say -- and they have -- it's in there.WILLIAMS: But the thing.BOLLING: Exactly.WILLIAMS: The thing about it.GUILFOYLE: It's in there.WILLIAMS: The thing about it Mr. White chocolate is.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.WILLIAMS: That white meat actually leads to lots of fights at Thanksgiving dinner.GUTFELD: Does it?WILLIAMS: Yeah, because then, you know, some people just want the white meat.BOLLING: The dark meat.GUILFOYLE: No.WILLIAMS: No.BOLLING: Oh yeah. The dark -- there's only.GUILFOYLE: No.BOLLING: Two.GUILFOYLE: Wrong.BOLLING: Two legs.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: Two drumsticks they go for.WILLIAMS: Yeah. The people go over this fight, but no, no.BOLLING: But after the fight is.WILLIAMS: You've got to meet my brother. But anyway, let me tell you. Oh my, gosh.GUILFOYLE: Everybody argues over the legs and the dark meat.WILLIAMS: I.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I think.PERINO: What about the giblets? Not for me.GUILFOYLE: No, Dana.PERINO: All right.GUTFELD: Is that some kind of euphemism?GUILFOYLE: I don't know.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: It is not a euphemism. All right, lot more to come on The Five's Thanksgiving Special to answer your questions for us about the holiday, there's also a Fastest 7 headed your way. But first, we hope you will stay tuned for our Thanksgiving dinner discussion. As you can see, we've got a lot of food here at the table.GUTFELD: Oh, yum.PERINO: Our favorite and least favorite side dishes and much more, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Welcome back to our Thanksgiving Special. Well, this holiday is about giving thanks, but it's also about food, family, and football. We're going to get to football a little later this hour, but first to my favorite topic, food.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: All right. Well, the folks over at Yahoo! Food just conducted a survey on how Americans celebrate the holiday. Forty-four percent say they are hosting Thanksgiving dinner. Nearly a quarter are eating at someone else's house. And nearly half of millennials -- remember them? Forty-four percent say they will serve ham, instead of turkey this year.PERINO: What?GUILFOYLE: I don't know what's going on there. And speaking of the turkey, 43 percent say that's their favorite food at the table this holiday followed by, runner up, stuffing always the bridesmaid, right? Then sweet potato casserole, pie, ham and mashed potatoes, green bean casserole -- are you full yet? And only 3 percent of Americans prefer cranberry sauce on Thanksgiving. That -- guess what? Secret. That happens to be Dana's favorite dish. Dana Perino.PERINO: I agree with you on the turkey. That's my favorite part of the meal.GUILFOYLE: Oh, but great.PERINO: But you had to pick your favorite side for the segment. I did say cranberries. However, these cranberries are not my favorite. These are my least favorite. They came from a can and that's not.GUILFOYLE: OK. We can't see them, but.PERINO: I'm afraid to pick it up because I'm wearing a white dress. But you know, it's like in the jelly can -- I mean.GUILFOYLE: Oh, I find them to be so delicious with preservatives. It's so yumbo.PERINO: Oh, I liked my mom's version.GUILFOYLE: Oh.PERINO: I know. Don't we all? Anyway, but cranberries are good because you can mix them with everything.GUILFOYLE: And they're very good for your urinary tract system.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: Is that true?GUILFOYLE: Well, yes.PERINO: Yes, for.GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: For women.GUILFOYLE: It's really is true. It's really is true.PERINO: Yeah.BOLLING: So men don't get to participate?(LAUGHTER)PERINO: That's an (inaudible). You guys are cool.GUILFOYLE: For everybody. But cranberry is actually very good for you. Cranberry juice, cranberries -- I mean, I think it's very tasty.BOLLING: The cranberry where.GUILFOYLE: There we go, Bolling, coming to you. That's Bolling's favorite side.PERINO: Yeah.BOLLING: Yeah, where is the.GUILFOYLE: On Thanksgiving.BOLLING: We used to have a bottle of wine.GUILFOYLE: They took it away.BOLLING: Took it away?GUILFOYLE: They took it away and.BOLLING: You have to have a little -- yeah, we'll get some wine, maybe vodka perhaps?GUILFOYLE: This is a sober Thanksgiving that we're having here, so -- OK, now Juan, what about you? What else do you like at Thanksgiving?WILLIAMS: I love stuffing. I love stuffing with gravy. I don't know why.PERINO: Because you look drooling almost.WILLIAMS: Yeah, because the carbs, the carbs just great for a guy like me, but I really like stuffing. And I used to think, and you mentioned giblets before. So my mom used to put them in there and they would come out of the middle, you know the chest of the turkey. And I would just be fascinating that you know when they were stuffing and sticking it in the oven, and then when it comes back.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: I just -- and both besides with gravy, can't beat it. I mean, you know how you go.GUILFOYLE: Oh, the gravy is up there -- good.WILLIAMS: It's kind of a serotonin stupor once you eat turkey. You know you just, want lay on the couch and watch football? But guess what, the carbs help even more. You are definitely is -- after that.GUILFOYLE: Because there's tryptophan like in the turkey, which actually calms you and the health give you a good night (inaudible).WILLIAMS: Yes.PERINO: She knows all the nutritional benefits.GUILFOYLE: Yes. And then, that's it. Then you eat a lot and all the blood rushes to your stomach and you fill like light-headed, then you take a nap with one of your relatives and it ends up being kind of bizarre. But anyway, so I love mashed potatoes. They are so good. I want to take -- I could eat mashed potatoes every single day.PERINO: So could my sister.GUILFOYLE: Of my life. Feast your eyes on this. I already took a little nibble out of them. I just think they're so satisfying. Can anyone here at the table, including our most gastrointestinally challenged friend at the table, they never give you of upset stomach. Mashed potatoes just represent. They're like a solid choice.GUTFELD: Are you talking to me?GUILFOYLE: Yeah because you have a lot of, you know, issues, but.GUTFELD: There is one side dish that can beat mashed potatoes. That side dish is alcohol. Of course, they take that shot.GUILFOYLE: Oh, that's where it went.GUTFELD: Alcohol. This is the only side dish that can erase the pain of these horrible segments about food that seem to go on and on forever about nothing, but nonsense. Wine, it's what's for dinner. It's what's for lunch. It's what's for breakfast, when you just want to explode from the interminable nonsense going on around you.GUILFOYLE: OK.PERINO: But that's at the fact.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Don't belittle the value of vodka.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Oh, yeah.GUTFELD: Vodka comes in the close I did.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: At Thanksgiving dinner.GUILFOYLE: By the way, says the guy with the screw cap wine - nice.GUTFELD: By the way, screw cap wine?(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: I know what it is. I should be in the wine business.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Burst like screw cap in California plum deck, I feel you. What's the point rating on that from Robert Parker?GUTFELD: Well, they crossed out to the thing. This is a Chateau.GUILFOYLE: It was $8.GUTFELD: Black pot.GUILFOYLE: $8.GUTFELD: Is it $8?PERINO: Bargain.GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: My gummy vitamins cost more.WILLIAMS: Shutdown.GUILFOYLE: Exactly.GUTFELD: I don't know.BOLLING: You can get a darn good wine.GUTFELD: Chateau Diana. They bought it.BOLLING: That's what they said.GUTFELD: At the local bodega around the corner, Chateau Diana.GUILFOYLE: You would know.GUTFELD: I do.GUILFOYLE: You used to go there.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Until they closed down.GUTFELD: I put it in the bag.GUILFOYLE: So is that counting as your favorite side.GUTFELD: That's my side.GUILFOYLE: Is wine?GUTFELD: My side dish.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: I mean so.GUTFELD: And no, that's my side dish -- yes.GUILFOYLE: OK. And Eric, yours is just vodka? I mean what?BOLLING: No, mine was stuffing but, yeah.GUTFELD: But Juan took it?BOLLING: You must have something.GUILFOYLE: And Dana had cranberries, OK. Good. Well, I like -- I'm with you with the carbs. I like the stuffing. I'm super loving the rolls, OK? The mashed potatoes, you can keep the yams. You're not.PERINO: Wow, you're not for yams?GUILFOYLE: I am not into it. And I also do not prefer beets, but they are not at the table. You just know that, if you'd like to take me out to dinner.WILLIAMS: But let me ask you something, Eric.GUILFOYLE: We won't share the beets salad.WILLIAMS: I love mashed potatoes, but everybody tells me, mashed potatoes are just like eating a bowl of sugar. That is just go -- your body just.GUTFELD: You know what? But the real question is.GUILFOYLE: What are you talking about?GUTFELD: I think we solved the purpose of Yahoo!GUILFOYLE: The Irish -- why?GUTFELD: I have been wondering for years, what does Yahoo! do? Yahoo! creates really stupid surveys around the holidays. This is the Yahoo! survey.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: But think about it. Has Yahoo! done anything? No. Yeah, they do these holiday surveys.GUILFOYLE: Well, you know what I appreciated, but I don't like their ranking with respect to mashed potatoes. And also please.GUTFELD: She won't stop.GUILFOYLE: Do not disparage the Irish because the Irish survived forever with potatoes and terrible potatoes famine, so please don't talk about the mashed potatoes in a bad way. This is what happens at Thanksgiving. People can get in little disagreements. Some are more substantive than others, but we can deal with family drama. Greg.GUTFELD: I love this.GUILFOYLE: I imagine that any table that you're at is problematic.GUTFELD: I just love how you are so into with this segment, it's amazing.GUILFOYLE: You know why?PERINO: Can we be.GUILFOYLE: You want me on your team.PERINO: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: You're moving to the kids table where the chair is a better height for you.GUTFELD: Oh, I love the kids table.GUILFOYLE: Dana, what do you do? I'm skipping Greg, bye, delete. What do you do when you're at the family table and there's someone that's awkwardly -- weirdo, problematic like Greg. How do you smooth over the family dramas in Thanksgiving?PERINO: It's hard for me, actually. Well, if it was Greg, I would send him to the kids' table with some wine.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: We are the beneficiaries of some very nice people because we are going to go to someone else's house, so I'm in that 25 percent that's going to somebody else's house for dinner, so.GUILFOYLE: Oh, really?GUTFELD: Good for you.PERINO: I don't really have to do too much.GUTFELD: I go to other people's houses when they're gone.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.PERINO: And raid their medicine cabinets?GUTFELD: Yes. You know that.GUILFOYLE: That will catch you a felony for the holidays -- yeah. And a new little orange outfit. Bolling what do you do?BOLLING: So through the magic of TV, I'm actually here, and by the most I will be in Las Vegas at the same time.PERINO: Of course you are.BOLLING: At the Las Vegas rescue mission, where the best things were you ever done -- yeah, we did it last year.GUILFOYLE: Very nice.BOLLING: We served dinner, Thanksgiving dinner, and the day after to homeless people. They serve 1,000 meals on Thanksgiving Day, probably another thousand the next day. I will tell you, though.GUTFELD: In Vegas?BOLLING: It's the rescue mission, it's not in.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: But it's.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: It's off the strip but -- the very cool thing about that is the hotels, the Wynn, The Palazzo, they donate all the food and it's fantastic. But having my son who is 17 now, sit down and not just serve people, but talk to them. This is -- if you're a parent, and you can have the opportunity to do this, you have to be screened and what not, but if you do this, it's one of the best things you can do as a parent for that kid for them to hear the struggles of people who are less fortunate. It's worth its weight in gold and yet, it's absolutely -- you have to take advantage of that.GUILFOYLE: Very sweet. It's official. Eric Bolling is going to heaven.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Well, maybe not, perhaps now, but.GUTFELD: Well, he's going to Vegas.GUILFOYLE: Well that's.GUTFELD: Close to heaven.GUILFOYLE: Which to be just close to heaven, exactly. All right, Juan.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: I'm going to wrap up this delicious segment with a little tidbit from you, a little nibble.WILLIAMS: Well, you know, it's interesting. You get to this -- by the way, I really like that, you know, because I remember doing that at Martha's table in D.C. But Anyway, when you go off with the relatives, there are often times lots of things that people just do that you don't even want to deal with. You wish you didn't have to see them. And then you say, well, it's thanksgiving and so you bite through your -- not the turkey, but your tongue in order to like sit there and smile and be nice, yeah.GUILFOYLE: Right.All right, well that's good. But you have a lot of practice being at our little table.WILLIAMS: Yeah, I do.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Everybody always acts like it's somebody else at the table. What if it's you?(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: Well, that's the thing. That's like.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: In fact, that's what I.PERINO: I know it is definitely not me.GUILFOYLE: I know.PERINO: It is not me.WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: It just keeps getting more.GUTFELD: I know.GUILFOYLE: Awkward for Greg.PERINO: Exactly.GUTFELD: I know it's me.WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: All right. Someone invite him to their table. Eric, up next, our favorite Thanksgiving traditions when we answer your thanksgiving-related questions posted for us on Facebook. And we'd like to know what you are thankful for this year. Tell us using #thankful on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. We'll back in a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DOUGH MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: I'm Doug McKelway in Washington with a look at the headlines. British Prime Minister David Cameron is trying to convince parliament to authorize air strikes against ISIS targets in Syria. Many Britons are wary of being drawn into another Middle East conflict after fighting in Iraq and Libya.Russia plans to retaliate against Turkey for the downing of a Russian military plane. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has ordered his government to draft sanctions against Turkey. And Vladimir Putin says Turkish officials have yet to apologize for the incident.If you are doing some holiday shopping this holiday weekend, you will have plenty of company. The National Retail Federation estimates almost 136 million people may hit the stores or go online between now and Sunday night. Seventy-three percent of those say they will shop on Black Friday.I'm Dough McKelway in Washington, I'll be back at the top of the hour with a live addition of Special Report, hope you enjoy your Thanksgiving Day.GUTFELD: We always have fun answering your questions for us on Facebook. And today, we're not changing a thing. This time there are all Thanksgiving related, so let's get started. I'll start with you Dana.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.GUTFELD: Go around this way. This is from Louise T. This is a similar question to something we discussed before, but I'm going to stress politically, in this question.PERINO: OK.GUTFELD: How do you deal with relatives that are in polar opposition to you, politically, at the Thanksgiving table?PERINO: I have to say, I don't think I have any that are that diametrically opposed to what I believe in.GUTFELD: Oh, how narrow-minded.PERINO: But I think that, one, is you have to find safe topics, OK?GUILFOYLE: Oh my, God.PERINO: So you have to go in, knowing that you want to ask about. Maybe do a little research, look at their Facebook page and say, ""Oh, I see that your grandson is playing soccer for Clemson, how great is that?"" Right, and then.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Are there any girls on that soccer team?PERINO: No.GUTFELD: Wow.PERINO: But there are -- there is a girl's soccer team.GUTFELD: I think it's quite misogynist. I can't believe that you would be OK with a sport that segregates sexes.PERINO: Yeah, it's true. But anyway, that's why I recommend.GUTFELD: How would you do that?PERINO: Is that, I would not.GUTFELD: How would you deal with that, Dana?PERINO: I would throw my plate at them.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: And walk away.GUILFOYLE: Oh my, gosh. Thanksgiving is a time.GUTFELD: All right.PERINO: That doesn't usually happen for me, though.GUTFELD: Oh, OK. Eric, how about you?BOLLING: I can't remember the question.GUTFELD: Oh. How do you.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: How do you deal with being politically...BOLLING: You ignore it. I think you just go, ""Let's not do this now.""I went to a bar mitzvah once. I'm sitting next to the host, the parents of the bar mitzvah kid, and on the other side there's a guy who's extremely liberal. I think he may have worked for The New York Times, as well.And the whole day my wife is like, ""Don't even talk to him. Don't get started."" And he's just at me. He knows I'm with FOX. He's at me the whole time. And we blow up into this big argument. And it felt so bad after. It was a good lesson, though. Just pave politics and religion out of the discussion.PERINO: Weather. You can talk about the weather.BOLLING: That's a good one. Sports and weather. PERINO: Pets, dogs. Always works.BOLLING: Basically, anything that's on the news that's not in the beginning. Sports, weather...GUTFELD: Well, again, sports, you end up in this whole world of this kind of male primitive behavior. Then weather, you have climate change. Animals, I mean, people treating animals as pets seems kind of animalist. I mean, why are we keeping dogs on leashes? You all make me sick -- Juan.WILLIAMS: Well, you know what? I mean, every day I'm at a table with people who disagree with me.GUTFELD: That's true.WILLIAMS: And some of them mock me.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: So you know what I mean?GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: So I have to deal with that.GUILFOYLE: I'm actually being restrained.WILLIAMS: Some of them mock -- some of them explode at me. Right? Some of them undercut me, right? And others of them simply demonize me. So that's what -- but you know what?GUILFOYLE: I'm the kindest. That was better than like cutting off, demonizing, undercutting, exploding. Yes, yes.GUTFELD: I don't demonize you.WILLIAMS: No. Look, I'm having fun with this.GUILFOYLE: Get a lawyer.I must say that I actually deal with this situation not only at Thanksgiving but every day of the week. If I see my sons, they remind me just how conservative they are.GUILFOYLE: Do they watch this show sometimes? Or they're...WILLIAMS: You know, Raffi works for the Republicans, and so they have to - - they not only watch this show, they track it so that they know exactly what topics we're talking about. I mean, believe me, this is a business.BOLLING: Is your brother liberal or conservative?WILLIAMS: My brother?BOLLING: Don't you have a brother?WILLIAMS: I do have a brother.BOLLING: Don't you argue over turkey?WILLIAMS: He is -- I don't know how I would classify his politics, but they're different than mine.GUTFELD: All right. Kimberly. How do you deal with this?GUILFOYLE: Well -- well, talk about other things that aren't controversial like religion and sex.GUTFELD: There you go.GUILFOYLE: I think they're easier than politics these days. And then what I do is I pretend I get, like, a text, and I get called in to FOX, and I have to leave. Yes.GUTFELD: I already talked about how I deal with it in the previous segment. So we'll move on.All right. Start with Eric.BOLLING: There's more.GUTFELD: There's more. This is from Gloria G. ""Do you go Black Friday shopping?""GUILFOYLE: What?BOLLING: No, I don't. I do a lot of shopping online now. I think that's pretty much what we do.GUTFELD: You need a computer for that.BOLLING: I love going to a mall. I love walking around a mall, even alone or with my family. I just like to see what people are doing.GUTFELD: I like walking in the mall when I'm alone, too, until they ask me to leave.GUILFOYLE: Ew, gross.BOLLING: Remind you that the mall closed three hours ago.GUTFELD: Exactly.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.GUTFELD: You can't wear a shorty robe in the mall.WILLIAMS: Whoa.GUTFELD: Dana, do you go Black Friday shopping?PERINO: No, but I do check out the deals online.GUILFOYLE: A shorty robe?GUTFELD: That's good. Well, that's very boring.PERINO: I don't like to go to -- I don't like crowds.GUTFELD: Really? Are you scared of crowds?PERINO: I'm not scared. I'm really short, and so then you end up like -- you know, like armpit height.GUILFOYLE: Why did you make me take the subway with you?PERINO: So that we could get to the restaurant sooner.GUILFOYLE: OK.WILLIAMS: I must say it's puzzling that people will, like, go out the night before and stand in line.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: And then they open at 6 a.m. So now they're doing more online. But I just think this is, like, are you crazy? Why would you be standing in line?It's terrible. It's awful.GUILFOYLE: I'm usually working. No, I don't. I get alerts on my email from, like, Amazon Prime and things like that and whoever else. And then I look and check it out. But I really don't find that there's a tremendous amount of deals to be quite honest.GUTFELD: Yes. It's all a lie. A big lie.GUILFOYLE: Yes. But I mean, you know, I want to contribute to the economy, but I feel I do that the -- all 365...PERINO: I like Small Business Saturday which is the...GUTFELD: The next day, yes.I do not engage in Black Friday shopping, obviously, because it's racist. And I'm sure -- what's next? Black Friday at the black market. I'm out of this.WILLIAMS: How about Black Friday, shopping matters.GUTFELD: There you go.GUILFOYLE: Ai, yi, yi.GUTFELD: Real quick, start with Dana. ""What's your favorite pie?"" This is from Judy R.?PERINO: Cherry.BOLLING: Apple.WILLIAMS: Apple.GUILFOYLE: Apple.WILLIAMS: Greg?GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.GUTFELD: Peach pie. The pie of peace. I wish we could all just eat peace.GUILFOYLE: Nobody said pumpkin. No one picked pumpkin.GUTFELD: No, not that pie.PERINO: You -- make pumpkin pie.GUILFOYLE: Can I tell you, I like pumpkin soup? It's very good.PERINO: I like that.WILLIAMS: Very good.GUTFELD: Well, that's not the right holiday.GUILFOYLE: I know but...GUTFELD: I don't know. Who cares?GUILFOYLE: You could eat pumpkin soup, and then pumpkin is represented.GUTFELD: Yes, there you go.GUILFOYLE: Yes, good.GUTFELD: All right.""Fastest Seven,"" holiday movie edition, up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Welcome back.

JORDAN, ACTOR: I heard about a third fight between you and Apollo behind closed doors. Is that true?SYLVESTER STALLONE, ACTOR: How do you know all this?JORDAN: I'm his son.A great fighter once said, it ain't about how hard you can hit. It's about how hard you can get hit.

I understand that the performances are very good. I'm excited. I'm going to go see it. Sometimes I get a little, like, pay-per-viewy. I'm going to go. I'm going to take myself.BOLLING: Juan, you're a sports fan. Do you like to see the boxing genre where you kind of maybe have an idea of who's going to win before the match even happens?WILLIAMS: Yes, because I think boxing such a human stage, I mean, about emotions and bravery and people who are able to get up off the mat, literally. So it's pretty -- and for me a lot of family involved in it. And I just -- so it means a lot.And I think this time, with everybody following what's happened with Ronda Rousey and Holly Holm, I think there will be more attention now to this kind of, you know, get up, come back. You know, people like that stuff.BOLLING: Very quickly, my wife's name is Adrienne, so the ""Yo, Adrienne"" thing, she's had it up to here from me. I won't bring my wife to it.Dana, ""Rocky""?PERINO: I haven't seen all six, but I think I might see this one. Because I think it looks -- is that how many there are? Yes. This is the seventh.

I remember...GUILFOYLE: I know.GUTFELD: I saw ""Rocky"" at the Manor Theater in San Mateo. I was -- I guess I was 11 or 10 years old. We're going to die soon.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.BOLLING: Now...GUILFOYLE: Don't invite Greg.BOLLING: The seventh ""Star Wars"" movie, the seventh movie out in theaters in just three more weeks.

He explains why he handed over the reins.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE LUCAS, DIRECTOR: They looked at the stories, and they said, ""We want to make something for the fans.""So I said, ""All I wanted to do was tell a story of what happened. It started here, and it went there. And it's not about space ships."" So they decided they didn't want to use those stories. They decided they were going to go and do their own thing, so I decided fine. If I get in there, I'm just going to cause trouble, because they're not going to do what I want them to do.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: I have to admit, I'm probably the only human being on the planet who hasn't seen one single ""Star Wars"" movie.GUILFOYLE: No way.BOLLING: But my friends Ron Mitchell and Nate Fredman (ph) say I don't know what I'm missing. He gave -- he sold the rights in 2012, Lucas.

Those people said, ""Look, we want to make a movie for the fans""? This is the guy who created the damn franchise. He should have said, ""Go 'F' yourself, you morons.""PERINO: Which I think is what he said.GUTFELD: That's exactly what he did. By the way, the great thing about ""Star Wars"" is it's wars. It's not star peace. There's good and there's evil. There's no relativism in ""Star Wars."" There's no negotiation. You have to kill or be killed.BOLLING: No participation trophies.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Micro aggressions.WILLIAMS: I don't think you're right.BOLLING: I may be wrong because I haven't seen them.WILLIAMS: In fact, Lucas says that he wrote those as family stories.GUTFELD: Yes.

As in what a mess.MURRAY: We have George Clooney. I rest my case.CERA: You saw ""Monuments Men""?MURRAY: I was in it.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You were so good in that.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You were great.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right. So there's an extended trailer on that. I think it looks absolutely fantastic. I can't wait to see it. Greg, your thoughts?GUTFELD: I disagree. Comes off as too arch, too cloying, too knowing, and it has Miley Cyrus in it. And you can just tell it's like, ""Hey, let's see how many unusually famous people we can get in one room.""My favorite holiday film remains ""Deliverance,"" which is -- it's a celebration of the outdoors and camaraderie.WILLIAMS: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.GUTFELD: By the way, that song, everybody knows that song.WILLIAMS: Can I leave now?GUTFELD: A great holiday song.WILLIAMS: Do I have to stay for the rest of dinner?(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: By the way, that's the thing.GUTFELD: ""Deliverance"" is a great film.GUILFOYLE: Not for Thanksgiving.GUTFELD: You're thankful that you're not in the movie ""Deliverance.""PERINO: I'd say for me, if I were on a plane, and it was the only thing to watch, I might watch it.BOLLING: Very good.

If you're going to watch a holiday movie, watch ""Home Alone.""BOLLING: All right. We've got to go.Up next, our best from the big football games tonight. Stick around.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: What's Thanksgiving without football? It's time now to place our annual bets on some of the big games tonight. Chicago Bears are up against the Green Bay Packers. And on the college side, Texas Tech versus the University of Texas.Well, you know, the funny thing about Green Bay and Chicago is it's kind of like, ""Oh, that's the grand tradition."" Like football dominates on Thanksgiving. Basketball, the NBA dominates on Christmas. Do you watch?BOLLING: Like football?WILLIAMS: Yes.BOLLING: Religiously.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh. Big time.BOLLING: Twenty-four/7, yes.I like Green Bay. They need to come back. They've had a couple of rough weeks. Aaron Rodgers is, like, in my opinion, the best quarterback in the league.GUILFOYLE: Wow.BOLLING: Love the guy, but he's had a couple of rough weeks. I think he'll bounce back.And in the college game, speaking of quarterbacks, the Texas Tech quarterback, I think, will be an amazing junior. He'll probably go after that, but he'll be a wonderful NFL player, as well. I think Texas Tech over the university...WILLIAMS: You really watch all those games?GUILFOYLE: Yes, he does.BOLLING: Football is my biggest passion, outside of work.GUILFOYLE: He's super into it.WILLIAMS: Aren't you a New York Giants fan?BOLLING: I like the Giants, but I like football.WILLIAMS: You watch any football.BOLLING: Any football, any level, any time.WILLIAMS: I'm amazed.GUILFOYLE: Yes, he loves football.WILLIAMS: What about you?GUILFOYLE: He loves sports. He loves it. He talks about it all the time.WILLIAMS: What about your young man?GUILFOYLE: Yes. No, he loves. He's a New York Giants fan, for sure. I'm a Giants fan now that I'm East Coast. I used to be a 49ers fan. But I still am in my heart.But I'll tell you what. My first sweatshirt, you know, sports sweatshirt growing up was Green Bay. Green Bay Packers, because my dad's best friend was a huge Green Bay fan. Like Greta loves Green Bay. And it said, ""The pack is back."" Yes. That's what's happening.I'm going with Green Bay strong. All right? So they're going to crush it. And I'm going to go with my friend, with Bolling on this. Texas Tech all the way. A great quarterback can make amazing plays. Sorry, University of Texas, because I do love the Longhorn State. Word.WILLIAMS: Well, Dana, I know that you are so passionate about football, and I, you know, so...PERINO: I like to watch it. I just don't know a lot about it. How about that?WILLIAMS: You like to watch?PERINO: I do like to watch it. Yes, I like to have it on in the background and do other things.WILLIAMS: Really?GUILFOYLE: ... good pics.PERINO: Read articles to send to all of you.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.WILLIAMS: You would put on football rather than a movie?PERINO: Yes.WILLIAMS: Really?PERINO: Definitely. So in this game, the Chicago Bears versus the Packers. I usually do mascot theory. But nobody can tell me what the Packers actual mascot is called. They say it's really kind of like nothing. But Eric makes a good point: they're the cheeseheads. And Bears can eat cheese, so I think the Chicago is going to win that game.BOLLING: You've done very, very good with that mascot theory.GUILFOYLE: Please, nobody bet their allowance or their mortgage with the mascot criteria.WILLIAMS: Hey, you know what? You throw darts at the board, sometimes that's better than the experts.PERINO: There's the expert.GUTFELD: Yes, I am. It's hard for me, because I like the Packers. And you know, I like the Bears. So it's tough for me.But you know what? I don't watch sports on Thanksgiving. And I'll tell you why I don't watch sports on Thanksgiving, because everybody's inside, which makes it a perfect opportunity to go outside and streak.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.WILLIAMS: At the mall?GUTFELD: Anywhere, everywhere.PERINO: But then nobody can see you.BOLLING: That's the point.WILLIAMS: I would like it.""One More Thing,"" up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: It's time now for ""One More Thing"" -- Greg.GUTFELD: Yes, well, you know what? The only way I was able to tolerate a Thanksgiving special is if I could hawk my book as a Christmas gift. Now that Thanksgiving is almost over, you can go Christmas shopping. But why brave the crowds when you can just go to my website, GGutfeld.com? Order this fantastic book. It will change your life. It will change your kids' life. It will change the world.GUILFOYLE: And it's such a...PERINO: Did you give anyone a discount on Black Friday?GUTFELD: I said I don't because it's racist.PERINO: Right. Juan, you're next.WILLIAMS: Well, you know, guess what? I was just looking over some statistics that the rest of my hosts hate. But they're statistics, and they came to 47 million people are going to travel 50 miles from home this Thanksgiving.Gas is cheaper. In fact, it's the cheapest it's been since 2008.GUTFELD: Thanks, Obama.WILLIAMS: The airline fares are down 10 percent. So you're going to have 65,000 more people traveling by air this year than compared to last year.The biggest travel days, for those of you who think ""I'm going to beat the traffic,"" Sunday the 29th and Monday the 30th. Of course, Thanksgiving day, the 25th right before, that's pretty bad, too.PERINO: All right. Are you ready for this? This is a new tradition we might start. Dana's Thanksgiving jokes, are you ready?GUILFOYLE: No.PERINO: What do you get if you divide the circumference of a pumpkin by its diameter?GUTFELD: What?PERINO: Pumpkin pi. Ha-ha. Very, very (UNINTELLIGIBLE).Why did the police arrest the turkey?They suspected it of fowl play.WILLIAMS: Ooh. I like that.PERINO: Good. OK, the third -- Greg.GUTFELD: If we laugh we only encourage you.PERINO: There's one last one. OK, you ready? What happened when the turkey got into a fight?He got the stuffing knocked out of him.GUILFOYLE: Those were kind of hard.PERINO: They're good riddles.GUTFELD: Those were really...BOLLING: That's amazing. You should do this every holiday.PERINO: We're about to. All right, great. You got your wish.BOLLING: Christmas and New Year's.PERINO: And you get to go next.BOLLING: All right. So a couple weeks ago, November 11, was Veterans Day. Chick-Fil-A in Kansas City, one of the employees, check out what he did. It's awesome.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE (singing): God bless the USA.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Check it out. Do you see the older guy right there and the two young kids? They were all tuned in. That was awesome.PERINO: All right. K.G.GUILFOYLE: Fantastic. Great voice. He might not be working at Chick- Fil-A much longer, because he'll be getting a job singing.And on that note about veterans, I just want to say from all of us here at ""The Five,"" God bless you to the veterans, the men and women that faithfully serve this country so that we can have freedom and turkey and liberty and all those wonderful things.I know that it must be hard for you serving away in foreign places to be away from your family.
