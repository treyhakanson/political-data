Blood and politics, that's the subject of this evening's ""Talking Points"" memo. There's some good news out of Iraq today.  There's no general uprising, and U.S. forces are pounding the terrorists on a number of fronts.  We'll have two eyewitness reports in just a moment. ""Talking Points"" urges the Bush administration to continue hammering the enemy, using full force and determination.  At this point, politics and the hearts-and-minds strategy must step aside and allow the military to deal with bad guys. Back home, John Kerry has been saying very little about the fighting, and that's smart.  Any criticism of the commander-in-chief right now by Kerry would be inappropriate.  America needs steely resolve, not political skepticism. About the larger question of running Iraq, Kerry is still locked into the Democrat mantra of the United Nations and Western Europe. ""Talking Points"" wonders if the senator is aware of the enormous bribery scandals swirling around the U.N.  Evidence points to the fact that high-ranking U.N. officials, as well as French and Russian officials, were bribed by Saddam, and that's why the brutal dictator got away with illegal behavior for so long. As for our so-called European allies, they may be more cooperative with Kerry than Bush, but they'll money to help us out in Iraq.  At least they're consistent. A bit more disturbing on the political front is the continuing bomb throwing by Ted Kennedy.  Kennedy continues to put forth that no cohesive strategy to fight terrorism is in his bag and seems bent on destroying the will of Americans to fight. Kennedy has never appeared on The Factor, but if he did, I would ask him this: under eight years of a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, al Qaeda rose in power and influence all across the world.  What did you do, Senator?  What did you do to combat that rise? From the very beginning on 9/11, ""Talking Points"" has been telling you we're fighting World War III. Iraq is a front on that war. Maybe it's the wrong front, but that's not important now. What is important for this country is that we defeat the Islamic fascists and defeat them decisively. Our goal to bring democracy to Iraq remains noble. There's no looking back now.  We're in it. We have to win it. And that's ""The Memo.""The Most Ridiculous Item of the DayTime now for ""The Most Ridiculous Item of the Day""...You know, I've been getting a few letters from partisans about the Iraq situation, and they're very annoying, to say the least.I'm withholding his last name, because I don't want to embarrass the guy, but Bill in New Hampshire says this: ""Mr. O'Reilly, I have watched you become increasingly opinionated and rude.  Your criticism of President Bush has caused me to stop watching 'The Factor.'"" Well, you're making the right choice, Bill.  A true believer like you will never accept any criticism of your guy, even if the criticism is on the money.  No president is perfect, and when I was hammering President Clinton, I didn't hear from you. There's no way this network can be fair and balanced or that ""The Factor"" can look out for you if we give certain politicians or political parties a pass. Unlike most news programs, we hold all the powerful accountable. And that's not ridiculous at all.  So stop writing me these letters about that. "	['Kennedy']	[]

Welcome, Mr. Leader.REP. TOM DELAY, R-TEXAS, MAJORITY LEADER: Hi, Stuart.VARNEY: Those people dancing in the streets of Fallujah, we saw that video right after the horrific crime of burning those Americans yesterday. It suggests that the insurgency is not confined to a few foreign fighters. Do you think that -- are we winning enough hearts and minds in Iraq?DELAY: Of course we are winning hearts and minds. These are localized terrorists and dissidents. This is something that you have to understand in the kind of war on terror that we are fighting, and the war in Iraq that we are fighting, that these kinds of things are going to happen. This is an abomination, but if any terrorist thinks that we are going to stop in our efforts to bring freedom and democracy to Iraq, they are going to end -- they are going to find themselves either in a cell or a cemetery.VARNEY: Do you think that this operation in Fallujah is going to be one of the keys to the election and Mr. Bush's standing in the polls?DELAY: Well, frankly, we shouldn't be talking politics. This is not about politics. This is about bringing freedom to Iraq and winning the war on terror.I noticed that Howard Dean made an outrageous statement that the president killed these people. And -- because of the war and his lying to the people. This is so disgusting and so outrageous that we are undermining the effort on the ground and undermining our soldiers on the ground, and it has got to stop. We need to unify as a nation, fight these terrorists, wherever we can find them.VARNEY: Can we transfer full authority to the Iraqis by the end of June if this security situation is not dramatically improved?DELAY: Well, that is not for me to say. That is a decision that the president has to make. And he has to evaluate where we are, in June, what the future looks like, and then make a decision. That is not for me to say.VARNEY: Sir, I want to switch gears completely and move to a very different subject, if I may, because today you released some very sobering statistics on child abuse. No decline in America in the past three years in the number of cases. What do you propose to do about this very disturbing situation?DELAY: Well, we're going to call for action and we are calling for action. There are 900,000 children last year alone that were abused or neglected in the most horrific ways, and this is probably an undercounting. There are a lot of children out there that are being abused that we don't know about.VARNEY: But what are you going do, specifically, what programs will you suggest?DELAY: Well, if I could finish, there are over 500,000 foster children that are in need of adoption or safe and permanent homes. And we need action. We need grown-ups to get involved in this. The American people to understand that this is going on and it is at a crisis stage. Children are dying and it is grown-ups' fault.VARNEY: Sir, if I may be personal for a moment, I understand that you and your wife have been foster parents over the years.DELAY: Yes.VARNEY: Successfully so. Would you suggest a big increase in the foster parenting program in America?DELAY: One of the things we are doing, Stuart, back home is we are building a whole subdivision of foster homes, bringing in people that want to love these children and raise -- and actually raise them, rather than warehouse them. It is those kinds of efforts that we need to spread all over the nation, to give loving homes, safe, permanent, loving homes for these children, and more important than that, for those foster children that can be adopted, we need to reach out to people and let them know that there are wonderful children that they can adopt and they can bring them into their families, love them and raise them.VARNEY: Well said, Congressman, and we thank you for joining us, Tom DeLay.DELAY: Thank you, Stuart.Content and Programming Copyright 2004 Fox News Network, L.L.C.
