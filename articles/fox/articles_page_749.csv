This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to ""Hannity."" And tonight, it's going to be a very big week for Donald Trump on the campaign trail. Now, the GOP nominee is scheduled to deliver a major speech outlining his immigration policy. Now, that takes place Wednesday in Arizona. He'll also travel to Detroit this week and this weekend to speak directly to black American voters.And earlier today, the Trump campaigned -- they released a new ad slamming Hillary Clinton on the economy. Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In Hillary Clinton's America, the middle class gets crushed. Spending goes up. Taxes go up. Hundreds of thousands of jobs disappear. It's more of the same but worse. In Donald Trump's America, working families get tax relief, millions of new jobs created. Wages go up. Small businesses thrive. The American dream, achievable.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Here with reaction, Donald Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway is back with us. Kellyanne, good to see you.KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Hi, Sean.HANNITY: Pretty ambitious week. I would argue the last two weeks have been the best two of the campaign in terms of staying on message. He seems to be very comfortable now with a teleprompter and less controversy in terms of social media. Is that by design?CONWAY: Well, he's having a great time out on the campaign trail, and I think, mostly, Sean because he brings his message directly to the voters.Look at the difference between the two campaign strategies in terms of just candidate appearances. He's at rally after rally. We have overflow rooms.  The people can't even get in, we have such demand for his rallies.And when he's there, what does he do? He talks about specific policy solutions. In the last two weeks alone, he has talked about defeating radical Islamic terrorism, granting middle class tax relief. He's taken his message to communities of color directly and challenged Hillary Clinton and Democrats to explain their records -- their awful records over a series of decades.He's addressed Hillary Clinton and her foundation. He's talked about law enforcement. I mean, the list goes on and on. If you want to know where he stands on the issues, tune into one of his rallies.You contrast that with Hillary Clinton who basically is doing fund-raisers and one single speech, Sean, not about immigration or health care or education or ISIS or the economy or jobs or infrastructure/energy. She gave one speech, and it was about Donald Trump and some Web sites. Soit shows you the different -- and you see it reflected in the polls now.  We put out a 10-state ad buy today with that economic ad really showing people they have a choice in this election, tremendous contrast on economic growth and taxes and middle class affordability.And the polls show it tightening everywhere. Emerson College released three polls today. We are within the margin of error in Ohio and in Pennsylvania and in Michigan, and in all three states, we lead her among independents. In the state of Ohio, according to the Emerson College poll, we are leading Hillary Clinton by 17 points among independents.And lastly, the Morning Consult poll came out yesterday showing that we cut Hillary Clinton's lead from 6 percent to 3 percent nationwide.But what was really remarkable about that poll, Sean, was Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump among women 44 percent to 35 percent. Sean, 44 percent of American women say they're going to vote for the first female president? It tells you that this election is about Hillary Clinton, and we will continue to make it about Hillary Clinton.HANNITY: (INAUDIBLE) one poll, too, and that was The LA Times poll. I predicted last week, you know, Hillary Clinton -- she was exposed last week in a pay-to-play scheme...CONWAY: Yes.HANNITY: ... where top donors of the Clinton Foundation, literally more than half the people she saw, individuals, as secretary of state were donors or pledged money to the foundation.Now, that's also the week that they released the Klan ad and make these horrible accusations. They seem to have doubled down on it. Is it overreach -- in other words, inasmuch as it's a mistake now for her, that it's so absurd and it's so silly that people see it as dirty politics, typical D.C. politics?CONWAY: What you just said is exactly how most voters will see it, Sean, for the following reason. Voters have to look at something. It has to make sense for them to believe it. And so I think Clinton and also Tim Kaine, who was a real disappointment last week playing this race card -- for them to go so far afield on these accusations and these conspiracies, most people will look at that and say that doesn't make any sense.And by the way, when is the last time you told me what my tax burden will be under your administration, why you call ISIS our, quote, ""determined enemies,"" as if we're playing a soccer match against them, rather than the savage murderers that they are -- 33,000 people killed since 2003, 80 percent of which were killed just in the last three years, since the birth and growth of ISIS.So people will look at that and say, You seem desperate. And in the case of Tim Kaine, I mean, we expect the rough and tumble politics, the lies from Hillary Clinton and her folks. But Tim Kaine -- he's been a mayor, a senator, a governor. You're running for vice president, Harvard law degree, and you stoop so low that you are making these allegations. And I think it's going to backfire.Look, forget about what I think. Look at the polls. If that were an effective message...HANNITY: And here's what's interesting...CONWAY: These polls were all taken after Hillary Clinton made that speech and after Tim Kaine and the ad were released.HANNITY: Now, Donald Trump is going to go back to Detroit. He's going to reach out again to the black community.CONWAY: Yes.HANNITY: He did it outside of Milwaukee. He's done another speech. So this will be the third speech. One interesting poll -- the Pew Research had him at 14.6 percent with the black community. Now, maybe not the highest number, but it is better than the last eight Republican presidential campaigns that have taken place.CONWAY: Oh, yes.HANNITY: And voters -- so how big a percentage of the black vote do you think he's able to get? And will that make up for some of the establishment Republicans, even some of his former rivals that didn't live up to their commitment to support the candidate?CONWAY: Yes, I do think so. And by the way, anything you see reflected in the polls, remember, Sean, that we are doing this -- Mr. Trump is doing this without the support of all Republicans. And it's quite remarkable because, you know, Mitt Romney can rely upon every -- practically every Republican legislator, all the donors line up. Everybody is just trying to help him become elected. And of course, they lost eight of the nine swing states. Let's not forget they got 6 percent of the African-American vote, 27 percent of the Hispanic vote, 26 percent of the Asian vote.At least give us our chance to improve upon those margins. And as you mentioned, the Pew poll, even the NBC poll last week, you see very dramatic improvement in our margins among the African-American community. That means that showing up and showing people that you care and actually addressing their concerns, and also appreciating and lauding their many accomplishments, is really the way to do this.HANNITY: Well, let me ask you this...CONWAY: We're not leaving any vote for granted in any state.HANNITY: Last question. Hillary and her campaign is spending up to $80 million to $100 million. I know you announced a $10 million ad buy. Do you think you need to match her dollar for dollar?CONWAY: We don't need to match Hillary Clinton dollar for dollar or personnel to personnel because we have something she'll never have, which is a candidate that is dynamic, magnetic, really compelling. People show up at these rallies wanting to see her (sic). I assume the reason she doesn't do that -- she goes to private fund-raisers with her Hollywood friends and elsewhere -- I assume because nobody counts how many folks are there. They just count the dollars afterwards.She couldn't fill up these rallies that Donald Trump fills up. She couldn't have these kinds of audiences. So...HANNITY: And 268 days without a press conference, right.CONWAY: That's right. That's right, 265 days without a press conference, by the way, which the press, very few seem outraged. They love covering Donald Trump because, you know, I mean, God, she's -- I know she's boring and she lies for a living, but there are two candidates running for president here. They should be both be covered more often.But we have something she'll never have. No focus group, no pollster, no donor, no 1,000 people working in Brooklyn will never change the fact between now and November 8th, we have the much more compelling, magnetic candidate that's willing to take his case directly to the voters. She -- scarcity seems to be their strategy.HANNITY: All right, we...CONWAY: When she comes out of hiding, it's really just to give a speech about him or to raise money.HANNITY: All right, Kellyanne, thank you.And up next on this busy news night tonight right here on ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: As I've said many times in recent days, it's hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends and where the State Department begins! That's what's happened.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump slamming Hillary Clinton as newly released emails appear to show the Clinton Foundation donors were, in fact, given special treatment by Hillary's State Department. Peter Schweizer and Dr. Ben Carson -- they're here with reaction next.Later tonight, new controversy over Hillary's 2010 speech in Saudi Arabia, where -- reportedly alongside Huma Abedin's mother, where Hillary allegedly defended the horrible treatment of women in Saudi Arabia. Jay Sekulow, Doug Schoen, Deneen Borelli will weigh in.Also, Sheriff David Clarke, Larry Elder react later tonight to Clinton playing the race card yet again against Trump. Much more -- this and much more as we continue.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The whole world has been shocked by the continuing revelations regarding Hillary Clinton and her pay-for-play State Department and other things! As I've said many times in recent days, it's hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends and where the State Department begins! That's what's happened.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump continues to go after Hillary Clinton over the numerous scandals revolving around her family foundation. Now, as ABC News first reported, newly released State Department emails appear to reveal that the foundation donors, of course, were given special treatment from Hillary's State Department. Now, 2010 emails showed discussions to give foundation contributors an invitation and preferred seating to a State Department luncheon with China's former president.Now, the Clinton campaign did provide us with a comment on this story, saying that Hillary Clinton's State Department only acted to advance America's foreign policy interests and didn't have any other intention.One of the Clinton donors that were involved in this report is denying attending the event, while another says that he does not have a record of it.Joining us now with reaction, author of ""Clinton Cash,"" Peter Schweizer.  Peter, you know, between that, and we've got another scandal emerging about a guy that you and I have talked about. What's his name, Chagoury, and his connection...PETER SCHWEIZER, ""CLINTON CASH"" AUTHOR: Yes, Gilbert Chagoury, yes.HANNITY: I'm sorry, Chagoury -- and his connection to the Lebanese, you know, Shi'ite-funded group Hezbollah, which is a terrorist organization as identified by our government.(CROSSTALK)SCHWEIZER: Yes, you're right, Sean...HANNITY: ... more revelations by the day.SCHWEIZER: Yes, no, that's exactly right. And what it's doing is it's further confirming what you and I talked about more than a year ago involving Gilbert Chagoury, involving pay to play. And that is these e mails are now confirming precisely that.Look, the Clinton Foundation is playing a major role in Hillary Clinton's State Department, determining which foreign officials she's meeting with, you know, who is going to have her ear or senior policy maker's ears on policy. And these are not, you know, just American corporations. These are foreign oligarchs who have their own agendas, Gilbert Chagoury being an example.Why this guy, who is connected with a movement in Lebanon that is allied with Hezbollah, that was on the national federal ""do not fly"" list in the United States is being given access to top decision makers at the State Department by Doug Band of the Clinton Foundation is beyond me. And it's evidence of this pay-to-play corruption.HANNITY: But you've got this guy, Doug Band, who works for the Clinton Foundation while Hillary is secretary of state. He makes the entre to Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills, and it seems that every time he does, that the connection is made for the people that gave money.Over half the meetings she had with private citizens are people that donated or pledged to donate. Well, that sounds like she's selling out her office! And often is the case, like the guy that got the forestry rights in Colombia, you give to the foundation, you get access to Hillary. You get meetings with people that can help make you more money, and I assume more gets back to the foundation.SCHWEIZER: Yes. That's right. I mean, we know now on at least three continents, that was the case, that the Clintons helped Clinton Foundation donors procure lucrative deals from foreign governments using her purchase as secretary of state as a sweetener. And then those entities, after they made their money, made large donations to the Clinton Foundation.Look, these meetings -- we're not talking about donors that are giving $25, $2,500, or even $25,000 to the Clinton Foundation. We're talking about half a million, a million, multi-million dollar donors to the Clinton Foundation. It's pay-to-play. And everybody in Washington knows...HANNITY: Chagoury, though -- I mean, there's a 2013 -- this is a guy that couldn't get a visa to get into the country because of his connection to a terrorist group called Hezbollah!Now, add to that Huma Abedin's mother, who I guess edited this book that, you know, endorses stoning and lashing of adulterers and the killing of apostates and sexual submissiveness for women, whether they want to or not, and even genital mutilation of women -- well, Huma got her mother and Hillary to go to a place in Saudi Arabia, a girls' school in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and Hillary Clinton says, Oh, we got to stop as Americans stereotyping Saudi women as oppressed!Well, they're told how to dress. They can't drive. They can't leave the country. They're told if they can go to school or work. And she said, We've got to stop oppressing them. Why? Because she wants more money to the foundation?SCHWEIZER: Yes. I mean, you know, Sean, look, money can buy you lots of things. It can buy you access. It can buy you favors. It can also buy you silence. And if you are movements around the world that can be legitimately criticized for the oppression of women...HANNITY: The Saudis bought her silence. Is that a fair statement?  Because if she's saying we've got to stop this myth that Saudi women are oppressed -- that's just a lie.SCHWEIZER: Well, it's not only a lie. It's completely out of character with anything else Hillary Clinton has ever said about women's rights in the third world.HANNITY: And money bought that, didn't it.SCHWEIZER: I think it did.HANNITY: Very likely.SCHWEIZER: I think it did...HANNITY: I believe it did, too.SCHWEIZER: There's no other way to explain it. There's no other way to explain it.HANNITY: All right, Peter, thank you, as always.Here with reaction, 2016 GOP presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson. Dr. Carson, let me play for you Donna Brazile, poor Donna struggling to defend this foundation issue. I felt bad for her. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONNA BRAZILE, DNC CHAIR: The way I look at it -- I've been a government official. So you know, this notion that somehow or another, someone who is a supporter, someone who is a donor, somebody who is an activist saying, I want access, I want to come into a room and I want to meet people -- we -- we all think criminalized behavior that is normal. I don't see what the smoke is.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: I don't see what the smoke is? It seems the only people that really had access to her is if you gave money! I doubt you could get in to see her when she was secretary of state unless you donated.(LAUGHTER)DR. BEN CARSON, FMR. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Sure. Well, if this is normal behavior, then we certainly don't want more of it. I mean, think about it. If you were secretary of state and you were going to engage in pay-to-play, what would you do? You would try to cover your tracks. And hence you see all these deleted emails and all this subterfuge.I feel sorry for Donna Brazile and the people who have to try to defend this because they know it's not right. But here's the real thing to think about. If you have all of these irregularities going on and she's secretary of state, what will happen if she is president? Just imagine that!HANNITY: I think that's a really good point. How is it that this doesn't seem to be penetrating? And do you think that the revelations last week and the new emails last week that showed that more than half of the people, private individuals she met with, actually donated to the foundation or pledged donations?Do you think they purposely used the race card to distract the attention of the American people by playing the Klan ad?CARSON: Well, I think that's always their default position. We can play the race card. And that, I think, in and of itself is a mistake, to liken Donald Trump to the Ku Klux Klan. It will make people start asking questions, like, Where did the Ku Klux Klan come from? They came from the Democratic Party.Who was the party of slavery? It was the Democratic Party. Jim Crow, the Democratic Party. Segregation, Democratic Party. Trying to keep guns out of the hands of blacks, the Democratic Party. Who resisted the passage of Civil Rights movement? The Democratic Party.HANNITY: Well, there's only one person in this race that actually praised a former Klansman as their mentor, and that was Hillary.CARSON: Exactly.HANNITY: She's praising Robert Byrd. Do you think that Donald Trump is now going to go back to Detroit -- and he's been in Milwaukee, and he's now given three specific speeches targeting black Americans and saying to them, Hey, you're not better off as black Americans under Obama and Hillary's policies. But I will make more opportunity for you and put Americans first.Do you think that message is going to resonate in the black community and increase the percentage of the black vote for the Republican Party?CARSON: I think it will. Of course, the Democrats are alarmed, and they're going to attack him vociferously. Why? Because this is their sacred cow, and they don't want that group of voters disturbed.But the fact of the matter is, you know, African-Americans are smart just like everybody else, and they will open their eyes. And they will recognize...HANNITY: Do you think -- but the race card is played every election season, every single time. Does it work? And if it didn't work, why are they playing it again?CARSON: Well, it does work for people who basically don't spend a lot of time analyzing the situation for themselves and saying, Are we actually better off? What is happening with our employment, with our out-of-wedlock births, with our families, with our education?But a lot of people are starting to ask those questions. I think Donald Trump is causing them to ask those questions. He's talking about it in all kinds of environments, and then he's going to bring it actually to the black community. And I think there will be a lot of people with their ears open, ready to hear what he has to say and evaluate it in an objective fashion, and I think it will have a difference.HANNITY: All right, Dr. Carson, always good to see you. Thanks for being with us.And coming up...HANNITY: You too, Sean.HANNITY: ... why was Hillary Clinton back in 2010 speaking alongside Huma Abedin's controversial mother about the need for people to go beyond, quote, ""the stereotypes,"" the mischaracterization of women in Saudi Arabia?  Really? I think it's actually fairly accurate.Coming up next, we will reveal what life is really like for women in that country. Jay Sekulow, Doug Schoen, Deneen Borelli weigh in next.Also tonight, Hillary Clinton continues to play the race card against Donald Trump while the GOP nominee is making a huge outreach to the black community. Sheriff David Clarke, Larry Elder weigh in tonight and more straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" So Hillary Clinton has long proclaimed that she's a champion of women's rights, but some damning new revelations might paint a much different picture. According to The New York Post, in February of 2010, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin arranged for Hillary Clinton to speak at an all girls' school in Saudi Arabia.And during her remarks, Clinton said, quote, ""When I was speaking to the women leaders, one of them asked me if I could, do anything about the media's portrayal of Saudi women, particularly the American media, which presents a very unidimensional view, as the women mentioned to me in our short, small meeting, focusing more on what's on your head than inside your head or your heart. My answer was, I wish I could do something about the way the media portrays these women. I think we all do a better job of getting beyond the stereotypes and mischaracterization.""For the record, let's take a look at how women are really treated in Saudi Arabia. For example, the Islamic theocracy has strict laws preventing women -- they can't drive a car. Also, laws requiring women to gain permission to work or even travel. And unbelievably, there is no law recognizing marital rape as a crime.Joining us now with reaction, chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice Jay Sekulow, FOX News contributor Doug Schoen, as well as Fox News contributor Deneen Borelli.All right, I think the thing that really stuck out here is, number one, Jay, she went to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in this particular case. She was with Huma Abedin's mother, who is a very controversial figure, and of course, we know she had edited some work of a colleague...JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE: Right.HANNITY: ... that basically condones stoning and lashing of adulterers, killing of apostates, sexual submissiveness by women to men any time they want, even female genital mutilation all acceptable under sharia.And then Hillary saying that, you know, Americans have to stop stereotyping Saudi women as oppressed. Well, what I just laid out is oppression of women, isn't it?SEKULOW: Well, could you imagine if this was the lead aide, the senior aide to Donald Trump or anybody else that was running for president of the United States? And it's not just her mother. Huma Abedin's name appeared on the Journal for Muslim Minority Affairs, which had these articles in it, some of which you've referenced, about 9/11 being the responsibility of the United States because of harassment in Iraq. You've got, of course, this situation with the Saudi school.The idea that the champion of women was advocating the position of Saudi Arabia as regard to women is repulsive! And I think that the double standard here is beyond ironic. Frankly, the mainstream media here, the main media outlets, should be making this the story that it is. And Sean, I'm glad we're covering it tonight.HANNITY: How, Doug Schoen, can you justify...(CROSSTALK)SEKULOW: ... an embarrassment to the American political system to see this!HANNITY: So Hillary Clinton is saying, We've got to stop stereotyping Saudi women as oppressed, when we all know on this panel they're oppressed.  And she takes up to $25 million for the foundation, $10 million for the library. Did the Saudis buy her off? Did they buy her silence on women's rights?DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: First of all, no, they didn't because in 2011, she and the State Department decried the precise behaviors...HANNITY: Excuse me! She said we've got to get rid of the stereotype of Saudi women being portrayed as oppressed! Are Saudi women oppressed, Doug?SCHOEN: Yes! She said it was wrong. She changed her position in The Guardian in June of 2011. The State Department...HANNITY: Oh, so they weren't oppressed in 2010 when they had to dress in a burka...(CROSSTALK)SCHOEN: She said the wrong thing, and I'm very glad she corrected the record. She should never be with Huma Abedin's mother or involved with that journal.HANNITY: Well, maybe not with Huma, either, considering Huma edited that paper.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: She was involved with Huma Abedin's mother. And that's the problem.(CROSSTALK)SCHOEN: And you know what, she made a mistake. She changed her position.  Thank goodness she did it.HANNITY: Oh, she changed her position after they gave the money?(CROSSTALK)SCHOEN: ... about Mr. Bannon and anti-Semitism.DENEEN BORELLI, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, Hillary Clinton is about power. She is not about a shred of principle.And look at who she was associated with. If this was Donald Trump, just like Jay Sekulow said, this would be headline news every day, all day.  Huma's mother believes -- she promotes sharia law. She doesn't think women should be independent. She thinks it's perfectly fine for women to participate in jihad, and she also said that America had 9/11 coming to us.These are pretty outrageous claims that are happening with this woman, and if this was the other way around, it would be outrage every day, all day!HANNITY: And Hillary, by the way, went and said this with her! She hung out with this woman. Her views were known at that time, was it not?BORELLI: No, absolutely right. This should be in the headlines all the -- you know, constantly.HANNITY: Am I wrong, Jay Sekulow? Look, to me, you give Hillary or the Clinton Foundation money. You buy access to the State Department. You get favors from the State Department, and you also, if you're the Saudis, you buy her silence. So she's really not a champion of women's rights, gay and lesbian rights.(CROSSTALK)JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE: But, Doug, it looks like the -- I mean, you can try to defend this, but it's really indefensible.DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I'm not defending it. I'm saying she made a mistake and corrected the record.SEKULOW: But remember, Sean, in this periodical that Huma Abedin is the coeditor, associate editor with her mother, were advocating the applicability of sharia, that working women were a violation and --HANNITY: But, Jay, you can buy her silence.SEKULOW: To me this whole war on women, it started with Huma Abedin, her mother, and Secretary Clinton allowed it to take place.HANNITY: Does this prove you can buy access to Hillary? Does this prove you can get her to compromise every principle as it relates to being a champion for women, gays, lesbians, who can be killed in Saudi Arabia, and Christians and Jews because you can't build a temple or a church. You can buy her silence, can't you?SEKULOW: The mother, by the way -- the mother specifically says that gay and lesbians could not be parents legally. This was in their periodical.HANNITY: Thank you all for being with us. I appreciate it.Coming up, Donald Trump continues to reach out to the black community and black voters as Hillary Clinton keeps playing the race card. We'll check in with Sheriff David Clarke and Larry Elder. That's next.Plus, this holiday weekend, Trump will travel to Detroit. He will speak with a crowd of predominantly black Americans and reach out for their vote.  We'll have reaction as HANNITY continues tonight.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" So over the weekend, GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, he came under fire over a tweet that he wrote drawing attention to the deadly violence that is now plaguing Chicago. Trump tweeted, quote, ""Dwyane Wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will vote Trump.""Now, Trump wrote a follow-up tweet later in the day, saying ""My condolences to Dwyane Wade and his family in the loss of, of course, their cousin.  They are in my thoughts and in prayers."" Liberals in social media were quick to criticize Donald Trump over the tweets while turning a blind eye to the violence that has caused the death of in this case Ms. Aldridge.Joining us now, Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, Salem Radio national syndicated talk show host Larry Elder. You know, they could say this, Sheriff Clarke, all they want, but I doubt that Barack Obama could name five names of the over 3,500 people, many of whom are black, that were killed in Chicago since he's been president.SHERIFF DAVID CLARKE, MILWAUKEE COUNTY: Kudos to Donald Trump. There was nothing insensitive about that tweet. As a matter of fact, I would have found it insensitive to not say anything about all the carnage that's going on in the city of Chicago, 460 people murdered, mainly black. And you look at that compared to coalition forces killed in Afghanistan since the start of the Obama second term in 2013, 275.Look, Mrs. Bill Clinton never saw this coming. The Democrats are scurrying because they know he struck a nerve. They've had to take out ads. They've had to go back. But the one thing they cannot do, they went for the race card. They cannot defend the indefensible. These American ghettos are hellholes, and Donald Trump is the only one that wants to talk about this.HANNITY: Larry Elder, Donald Trump is making a huge effort, more than any other presidential candidate I can think of in recent memory, maybe besides Rand Paul, who ran in this cycle, that wants the black vote, saying, I want your vote, and he's going to Milwaukee, and he's going to go back to Detroit this weekend.Look at the numbers. Chicago alone, many of these homicides are black Americans, 3,579 since Obama has been president. The number of African- Americans, black Americans on food stamps, up 58 percent under Obama, number of black Americans in poverty has jumped more than eight percent under Obama. You take it further, number of African-Americans not in the labor force, up 20 percent. This is insanity. Number of home ownership rate for black Americans, down 4.6 percent. Household income, real dollars, down under Obama. What has he done for the black community? What has he done or Hillary done to deserve 93 percent of the black vote like Obama got in 2012?LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONAL SYNDICATED HOST: I would also say, however, that Ben Carson also made an effort to attract the black vote.HANNITY: Good point. Fair.ELDER: Look, what Donald Trump is doing is calling into question the entire ethos of the Democratic Party, which is why they're pulling out the race card. God forbid that black people should rethink the welfare state that has incentivized black women to marry the government and allowed man to abandon their financial and moral responsibility. God forbid that black should rethink government schools that they're assigned to without voucher.  When parents have had vouchers, parental satisfaction has gone up, graduation rates have gone up, test scores have improved.God forbid they ought to question minimum wage. At one time believe it or not, a black teenager was more likely to have a job than a white teenager.  And of course this Black Lives Matter movement, which is founded upon a lie, which has caused cops to become more passive and crime has gone up and victimized innocent black people. So Donald Trump is asking black people to rethink all of this. And when they wake up, and they will, there's going to be hell to pay at the ballot box.HANNITY: It's going to be interesting, you look at those numbers, and they're overwhelmingly bad for the black community. Liberal, leftist, statist, socialist policies have not worked for the black community, and the murder rate is so high, but they only pay attention in the case of Obama and Clinton to high-profile race cases that they can use as the lens or prism that advances the narrative that they want.Every election, sheriff, though, Missouri, Democratic Party, 1998, elect Republicans, black churches will burn. James Bird ad in 2000. Al Gore telling a predominantly black population in a speech that, oh, by the way, Republicans have the wrong agenda for black Americans and they don't even want to count you in the census. Now the Klan ad put out by the Clinton campaign and updated by Tim Kaine over the weekend as well, you know, it's the most despicable form of politics. Does it backfire or does it work?CLARKE: It backfires. I like that saying that dog just won't hunt this time. Look, these progressive urban policies have destroyed cities. They have wrecked motivation. They have created a permanent underclass in the American ghetto.What I find encouraging, Sean, is that a recent poll that just came out said 16 percent of the black vote is undecided in this race, 16 percent.  If Donald Trump captures five to eight percent of that 16 percent, and that 16 percent tells me these people want to take another look. If he gets five percent to eight percent of this, he wins this thing going away in some of the swing states like Virginia, North Carolina, and other places.HANNITY: So those are the undecided. What percentage -- the Pew poll had him at 14.6 percent of the black community. Larry Elder?ELDER: Who knows? I'm predicting he can get as high as 20 percent to 25 percent because I hear in California there was a ballot initiative to get rid of race-based preferences, and about 30 percent of blacks voted for that, so I think that's a sweet spot. Also Donald Trump has talked about the impact of illegal immigration, putting downward pressure on wages and downward pressure on jobs in the inner city. These are the kinds of things that if he continues to talk about them, he can stave off a substantial --HANNITY: And you don't think the race card works? Why do Democrats keep using it every election year if it doesn't work?ELDER: Well, it does work.CLARKE: They're a one-trick pony.ELDER: What they're doing is trying to tell black people race and racism remain major problems in America, which they don't. And these guys over here, these Tea Party guys, these conservative black guys like Sheriff Clarke, they're the enemy. And, by the way, we're the savior. And unfortunately it has worked, but it's not going to work for very much longer.HANNITY: Sheriff, last word.CLARKE: Look, this thing is wide open right now. There's a good chance that Donald Trump will make inroads. I'm not going to predict any seismic shift in the black voting habits just yet, but I'm very encouraged by what I'm seeing. You cannot defend life in the American ghetto. Democrats have herded black people, taken them from the cotton fields, and now they have them herded onto that plantation called the American ghetto.HANNITY: Thank you both for being with us. When we come back tonight right here on ""Hannity.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: African-Americans have given so much to this country. They've fought and died in every war since the revolution. They've lifted up the conscience of our nation in the civil rights movement.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: We'll have more on Donald Trump's outreach to the black American community and African-American voters. This holiday weekend he's going to Detroit. We'll have reaction, that and more as HANNITY continues.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: African-Americans have given so much to this country. They've fought and died in every war since the revolution. They've lifted up the conscience of our nation in the civil rights movement. They've sacrificed so much for the national good. Now is the time to put a new agenda into action that expands opportunity, ensure equality, and that protects the rights of each and every citizen.We have to stop the crime. We have to stop the bad education. We have to help with housing. We have to solve our inner city problems and we will.  I will fix it.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump on Saturday reaching out to African-American voters in what could be a preview of next weekend's trip to Detroit where Trump will address a predominantly black audience.Joining us now with analysis, the CEO for the NOW Network, an executive of Trump's Evangelical Advisory Board, Pastor Mark Burns, and the senior pastor of the New Spirit Revival Center and the CEO for the National Diversity Coalition for Trump, Reverend Darrell Scott. Guys, good to see you.I see that you've caused quite a bit of controversy, Pastor Burns, and you had an image you tweeted out of Hillary in black face when she had changed her cadence, saying ""I ain't in no ways tired,"" and she made that -- by the way. It's a common thing. I don't understand, Al Gore, Hillary Clinton get before predominantly black audiences and their whole speaking style and cadence and pitch change, and then you talked about her hot sauce comment and affiliation with Black Lives Matter and F the police. But a lot of people are angry with you tonight. Why would you put her in black face?PASTOR MARK BURNS, NATIONAL DIVERSITY COALITION FOR TRUMP: What's really the tragedy is the Clinton family, the Democrat Party not owning up to their failed policies with African-Americans. What the real tragedy is, the fact that African-Americans across this country are not doing just as well as other families are in this country due to failed policies of the Democratic Party and not owning up to it.HANNITY: Do you have any regrets of doing it, or do you stand by it?BURNS: I'm going to say, obviously, I'm a pastor. It is never my intention to offend anyone. So naturally, it's because many people are offended by it, you know, I don't want to do that. I don't want to offend anyone. My job is to bring peace and bring people together, not divide.HANNITY: Is the broader message, putting aside the controversy, is the broader message, as we were discussing in the last segment, black Americans have not fared well under Obama's policies, under Hillary's policies? A 58 percent increase in black Americans on food stamps, 20 percent increase black Americans not participating in the labor force, those numbers are dramatic.BURNS: The math is real. And we don't want to deal with the math. What I think is even more troublesome, really this is political correctness at its highest. The very fact that we are talking about the African American community like we're one great herd of cattle that you can place in the barn and talk to one group of African Americans you're talking to all of us.HANNITY: Pastor, historically, demographically in these presidential elections, you know, 90 percent, sometimes more of a black community votes Democratic. But the black community has not fared well under the last eight years, policies of leftism, statism, liberalism, redistribution.REV. DARRELL SCOTT, NATIONAL DIVERSITY COALITION FOR TRUMP: We've been traditionally voting Democrat, once again, out of what I just said, tradition. A number of blacks vote Democrat and don't even ask themselves why. They think, well, I'm a Democrat. And why? Because I'm a Democrat.  And they haven't questioned it. But they don't see what the fruit, what the result of the Democratic Party's policies for black America are. And the Democratic Party takes black Americans for granted. The Democratic Party takes the black vote for granted.HANNITY: But do you think the use of the race card, which Hillary and Kaine are now doing, do you think it's effective? And if they didn't think it was effective they won't be doing it every two to four years, would they?SCOTT: They wouldn't. And they think it's effective because it keeps blacks on the plantation. I call the Democratic Party the plantation.  They keep the blacks on the plantation.We've got to realize they're trying to act if Trump is just now beginning to engage the black community. We engaged with Mr. Trump over a year ago.  And last October, 2015, over 50 of us met with him in Atlanta. Last December, over 100 pastors met with Donald Trump, and the Democratic Party fuelled the outrage. They didn't even know what we were sitting down to talk about. But the Democratic Party fuelled the outrage of you shouldn't talk to him. You should not have any dialogue with him. Now he's going to appear on the Impact Network, which is the largest African American-owned black gospel network in America. He's going to appear that network, and they're going to have a question or answer with them, and the black community is beginning to get into an uproar, again, and the Democrats are behind it.HANNITY: And do you think Trump should get 20 percent of the black vote?SCOTT: He should get 100 percent of the black vote.HANNITY: Guys, thank you.When we come back, we need your help. Our question of the day is straight ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" So ""Question of the Day,"" what do you think about Trump's new ad attacking Clinton on the economy? Aren't elections usually won on peace and prosperity? The economy would be the prosperity part.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST:  Breaking tonight, newly released emails about the Clinton Foundation are leading to some serious new allegations, suggestions that the foundation was collecting millions in a cash for favors setup during Mrs. Clinton's time at state.  And tonight a former Justice Department lawyer is telling us the new revelations suggest some legal lines may have been crossed.  Good evening and welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone.  I'm Megyn Kelly.  New details emerging now after a Federal Court ordered the release of more e-mails from Clinton's private server.  These are documents recovered by the FBI that Mrs. Clinton may have tried to destroy, and they are just the latest drip in what's becoming a steady stream of troubling messages between Hillary Clinton's family charity and her State Department staffers, who appear to be very cozy.  The messages lend credence to the notion that there are wealthy donors who paid top dollars for favors from America's top diplomat while ordinary Americans were left to fend for themselves if they wanted access.  Even Mrs. Clinton seems to admit this doesn't look good.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  My work as secretary of state was not influenced by any outside forces.  I made policy decisions based on what I thought was right.  I know there's a lot of smoke, and there's no fire.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  In moments, we'll speak with former Justice Department Lawyer Shannen Coffin, who says there are potential violations here of at least three federal laws.  But first we go to Trace Gallagher, our breaking news desk with the details from these new messages.  Trace.  TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Megyn, if you're connecting dots, this latest round of emails appears to draw a bold line directly between the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton's inner circle while she was secretary of state.  The emails were given to ABC News by the conservative group Citizens United.  In one exchange from 2010, top Clinton Foundation official Doug Ban and Hillary Clinton's closest aide Huma Abedin talk about special seating for an upcoming State Department lunch with Chinese President Hu Jintao.  Doug Band even names names, including the president of UBS Wealth Management Bob McCann, Western Union CEO Hikmet Ersek and Rockefeller Foundation President Dr. Judith Rodin.  A later email specifically requested that Rodin be seated at Vice President Joe Biden's table, to which Huma Abedin responded, quote, ""I'll ask.""  For the record, UBS had given the Clinton Foundation between $500,000 and $1 million.  Western Union, between one and five million.  The Rockefeller Foundation, between 10 and 25 million.  When asked about the Clinton Foundation trying to get prime seats to a lunch for a foreign dignitary, the State Department said it, quote, ""Does not believe it is inappropriate.  The Clinton campaign called Citizens United a right-wing group trying to make something out of nothing.""  And on ABCs this week, the interim chair of the Democratic National Committee Donna Brazile seemed to acknowledge that giving big donors access is just part of the process.   Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONNA BRAZILE, INTERIM DNC CHAIRWOMAN:  This notion that somehow or another, someone who is a  supporter, someone who is a donor, somebody who is an activist saying, I want access, I want to come into a room, and I want to meet people, we -- we all think criminalized behavior that is normal.  And I don't see what the smoke is.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER:  Again, the smoke comment.  The State Department says, it cannot provide a list of who did and did not attend the lunch with the Chinese president -- Megyn.  KELLY:  Trace, thank you.  Joining us now, Shannen Coffin, former Justice Department assistant deputy Attorney General under President George W. Bush and a former chief legal counsel to Vice President Dick Cheney.  Shannen, good to see you.  SHANNEN COFFIN, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ASSISTANT DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Hi, Megyn.  KELLY:  So, I mean, Donna Brazile, you got to hand it to her on the honesty front.  You know, I like Donna Brazile.  But it's not going to fly with the American people to say, look, everyone is bought off.  You know, like your donors give you lots of money so they get access that the American people don't get.  And they get invited to the State Department, they get to rub elbows with power and set themselves up for future success in a way regular Americans don't.  That's something we have to live with.  You say it's actually not that simple.  It actually might be criminal.  COFFIN:  Well, look, their claim is there's only smoke, but lots of people die from smoke inhalation.  So, smoke is the problem here,  and there are -- look, in addition to what Trace discussed, we saw emails last week that the Crown Prince of Bahrain was going through the Clinton Foundation in order to get a meeting with Hillary Clinton at the State Department when normal channels had prevented him from doing so.  And the same channel.  KELLY:  And this again, you see it very clearly.COFFIN:  It was Doug Band to Huma Abedin.  KELLY:  Trace just took us through it where you got the guy from the Clinton Foundation, Doug Band, specifically sending the people he wants to see at this luncheon for the China State Luncheon and gives three names.  And then --  COFFIN:  Right.  KELLY:  He asked about this one person in particular, saying, can we get her at Biden's table?COFFIN:  So let's --  KELLY:  And Huma Abedin says, I'll ask.  I mean, this is -- this is what Trump has been trying to tap into saying she's bought and paid for.  She owes so many favors to so many people who have donated to her foundation that you can never get an honest judgment from her because it's all about repaying the people who paid her.  You say it actually may be criminal.   Why would you go that far?COFFIN:  Yes.  So, look, there's a back door here that normal citizens don't have.  If you make a contribution to the Clinton Foundation, you're more likely to get access to Hillary Clinton at the State Department.  And there are at least three different categories of federal laws which may be implicated.  One, the ethics and government act, which says you can't use a public office for private gain for yourself or even for a charity, the law says specifically, a charity that you're associated with.  So in giving special access to the donors for the Clinton Foundation, the ethics and government act is implicated.  KELLY:  Well, but let me ask you that.  Because the -- but how does Hillary gain?  You're talking about a private gain.  How does she gain?COFFIN:  But that's not what the law -- it doesn't require that money go into Hillary's pocket.  It could be enough that her husband gets speaking engagements.  KELLY:  Which happened.  COFFIN:  It happened.  It could be enough that the foundation with her name on it gets more money, which is also happened.  KELLY:  All right.  Now, the second one that you're focused on, potential law here, is the bribery, the anti-bribery laws.  How could that be violated?COFFIN:  Well, look, this is the hardest group of statutes to prove.  You have to have a quid pro quo.  And we've seen in a recent case involving the former governor of Virginia that just setting up, say, you know -- sitting someone at a luncheon may not be enough to violate those statutes.  KELLY:  Right.COFFIN:  But I will tell you this.  The federal government, if the shoe were on the other foot here and a U.S. company were giving money to a foreign charity that was associated with the foreign secretary, the polish secretary of state, the U.S. government would prosecute -- the U.S. government would prosecute that U.S. company.  And that's exactly what we have here.  That's called the foreign corrupt practices act, but that's based on the U.S. bribery laws.  So for the people who are seeking access to Hillary Clinton by giving money to the charity, there's a grounds for prosecution of those givers, okay?  Now, whether or not that Hillary Clinton can get reached by those laws, there's a lot more facts that have to be developed.  KELLY:  It's unbelievable.  When you see the tentacles of the Clinton Foundation and how dicey this was for her to maintain it.  COFFIN:  But let's talk about the foundation.  KELLY:  Quickly.  Go ahead.COFFIN:  The foundation could be a foreign agent for the Prince of Bahrain.  When the foundation says, he's our friend.  Can you get a meeting with Hillary Clinton, and Huma says, Friday at 10:00, the foundation itself could be an unregistered foreign agent.  Whenever a foreign agent -- when an agent for a foreign government or a foreign company goes before the U.S. government and seeks favors, that person is supposed to register with the Justice Department.  KELLY:  I got it.  COFFIN:  That certainly didn't happen here.KELLY:  And they're not supposed to do the bidding of some foreign dignitary at our State Department.  I got to leave it at that.  COFFIN:  That's right.KELLY:  Shannen, great to see you.  COFFIN:  Good to see you too, Megyn.  KELLY:  I mean, it's -- you get it?  Right?  It's like complex.  And this is why many people just leave it to the side and don't bother, but you understand what was happening, right?  I mean was it improper?  Did it have the appearance of impropriety, and was it potentially illegal?  Those are all fair game questions in an election for the presidency.  Meantime a new poll suggests this foundation story is becoming bigger.  In the latest Monmouth survey, 54 percent say that Mrs. Clinton gave special treatment to foundation donors.  They believe she did.  David Wohl is an attorney.  Richard Fowler is a nationally syndicated radio talk show host and a senior fellow at the New Leaders Council.  Good to see you both.RICHARD FOWLER, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Good to be with you, Megyn.KELLY:  Richard, I mean what do you make of this, why is the Clinton Foundation telling Hillary's right-hand woman who they want at this lunch and where they should be seated?FOWLER:  Sadly, Megyn, this is what you called the same old Washington politics where you're Democrats or Republicans.  People play connections in different departments, into the White House.  It happened all the time.  We saw Halliburton had no bid contracts into the Iraq war.  This is the same old Washington politics, which is where I agree with Donna Brazile.  If we want to end that, we take the --  KELLY:  They do.  The American people do want to end that.  FOWLER:  But before we go and penalize the Clinton Foundation for what they've been able to do, let's talk about all the good things they've done.   Right?  KELLY:  Oh, come on.  That's not in dispute.  I'm conceding that point for the purposes of this discussion.  That's a dodge, Richard.  That's a dodge.  FOWLER:  No, but here's the thing --  KELLY:  We're not talking about whether the Clinton Foundation did good things.  Good.  Good for them.  We need charitable organizations.  The question is whether Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton used it.  FOWLER:  Megyn --  KELLY:  Used her possession at the state --  FOWLER:  They did not.  KELLY:  To give donations to it, which is not allowed.  Go ahead, David.  DAVID WOHL, ATTORNEY:  Megyn, you know, it's clear that upon being confirmed as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton wasted no time in converting the State Department into a full-fledged business partner of the Clinton Foundation.  Are you kidding me?  There is so much corruption, so much pay to play.  KELLY:  Okay.  What is the proof?WOHL:  What is the proof, Megyn?  I'll tell you what the proof is.  The UBS case took place in 2009 right after her confirmation.  They came up to her and they said, look, the IRS wants the detailed information of all of our people with offshore accounts.  Can you kind of help us with that?KELLY:  Yes.  WOHL:  She goes to the State Department.  She gets that cut out.  And what happens right after she takes care of that problem?  That UBS donates ten times as much money to the Clinton Foundation, and suddenly Bill Clinton gets this lucrative contract for $1.5 million to do question and answer sessions with who?  UBS people.  UBS executives.  FOWLER:  That's absurd.WOHL:  It's quid pro quo, and it's --  KELLY:  It happened.  He's right.FOWLER:  Megyn, there's a couple --  (TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)  KELLY:  Richard, that happened.  The journal reported on this extensively at the time.  FOWLER:  There's a couple problems in David's analysis.  Number one, Hillary Clinton has no power over the IRS whatsoever.  Number two and more importantly, the fact just because her husband got a speaking gig from UBS does not mean that the Secretary of State was implicated in any --  KELLY:  It's an unusual intervention on her part.  An unusual intervention.  FOWLER:  Fair.  Not to mention the fact that the lawyer before talked about this China dinner, right?  The three people that went to the China dinner all have business involving China, the Rockefeller Foundation.  KELLY:  I bet they did.  That's why they wanted her to get them in.  FOWLER:  But that's the job of the secretary of state, to lobby for American businesses.  WOHL:  The cause and effect are unbelievable.KELLY:  That's right.  Speak to that, David.  You hear his point.  That's her job.  Her job is to lobby for American businesses.  (TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)FOWLER:  Exactly.WOHL:  And Megyn, here's the reality.  There's not going to be a prosecution.  There's not going to be a prosecution because of the fact that Loretta Lynch's boss has formally endorsed Hillary Clinton.  But the reality is while there may be no legal consequences from what's happened here, this bribery, this racketeering, and that's what it was, there will be political consequences.  The polls are already starting to show that.  Donald Trump is moving up in the polls, and it's in large part because of this.  FOWLER:  I don't know what polls you're talking about, but okay.  KELLY:  All right.FOWLER:  All the polls show that Hillary Clinton is ahead sizably, number one.  And, number two and more importantly, is that Donald Trump has more problems than -- he has more problems than O.J. Simpson when it comes for running to be president of the United States.  So, there you have it.  KELLY:  I'm going to have to digest that.  WOHL:  Come on, Richard!KELLY:  I thought you were going for more issues than a magazine rack.  FOWLER:  I was trying -- I was trying for a good analogy.  KELLY:  Okay.  Great to see you both.  So, there are also some new dramatic questions tonight about what some call the original campaign promise from Donald Trump.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  We're going to build the wall, and who's going to pay for that wall?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Is that wall already crumbling right in front of our very eyes?  Governor Mike Huckabee is next on that.  Plus, one of the NFL's highest paid quarterbacks sparks major backlash for refusing to stand for our national anthem.  And tonight he is threatening a new protest, and he is not alone.  Plus, America today lost a beloved actor, and we'll have a special moment for the man who brought to life Willy Wonka.   (PURE IMAGINATION MUSIC PLAYING)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Breaking tonight, the Trump campaign is engaging in a new round of damage control on the issue of immigration after reports suggest the candidate may be backtracking on his plans to build a wall on the Southern Border.  This is obviously a critical issue for Trump supporters.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will have Mexico pay for that wall.  Mark my words.  (AUDIENCE CHANTING)Build that wall!  Build that wall!TRUMP:  Build that wall.  We're going to build that wall.  Don't worry about it.  We're going to build that wall.  We're going to build the wall, and who's going to pay for that wall?(AUDIENCE):  Mexico!TRUMP:  Who?(AUDIENCE):  Mexico!They think we're kidding, too, don't they, folks, huh?  We're not kidding.   We're not kidding.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Well, with Trump's much awaited speech on immigration scheduled to happen just 48 hours from right now, we're now hearing new questions about whether that wall he has so proudly promised is actually going to be a real wall.  First Trump supporter and former Texas Governor Rick Perry was suggesting last month that it's a quote, ""technological"" and, quote, ""digital wall.""  And today Trump confidant Rudy Giuliani was suggesting it maybe a little bit of both.  RUDY GIULIANI, R-FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR:  He's going to build a wall.  It's going to be a technological as well as a physical wall meaning --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We hear 35 feet high with wall technology --  GIULIANI:  Yes.  And with technology that can detect people five, six miles away.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Chief political correspondent Carl Cameron is live for us tonight in San Francisco.  Carl?CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Megyn.  And it is the case that Donald Trump has said that much of what he enunciates on the campaign trail could ultimately be viewed as a bargaining position because he's going to make deals and get things done.  And in fact he himself has said that the wall in some places wouldn't be practical because there are topography problems, lots of mountains that would make it difficult to build a wall, and that technology would be much more better suited to work in those situations.  And those are the sorts of asides that he has offered in the past in his unscripted, untelepromptered remarks about immigration reform.  The Wednesday speech now has that added to the list of questions because over the course of the last two-and-a-half to three weeks, Donald Trump has been particularly cautious in his rhetoric and put an awful lot of pressure on his surrogates to explain exactly what's going to happen on the other two sort of foundational points of his immigration policy.  One, he's already revised his proposal for a ban on new Muslim visitors or immigrants to the U.S. on a temporary basis.  That's now turned into extreme, extreme vetting.  And then comes the question of what to do about the undocumented immigrants who are in this country, the illegal immigrants that he's promised to deport with a deportation force.  And on that, the question is still open, and many of his advisers have suggested that that softened rhetoric that he talked about Sean Hannity with could make it possible for some illegal immigrants to stay in this country, albeit not with legalization.  For that they'd have to go home.  All of these are questions that we presume will be answered on Wednesday when he'll go to Phoenix for a teleprompter speech to deal with what are questions that may court independent swing voters.  At the same time they alienate the very Republican base that came to love in the early part of this when he made this type of tough immigration reform, really the signature of his campaign -- Megyn.  KELLY:  Karl, thank you.  Joining me now, former GOP presidential candidate Governor Mike Huckabee.  Governor, good to see you.  So, what is the point of surrogates coming out and talking about, you know -- why not just stick with he's going to build a wall? Why is anybody injecting, well, it's going to be a technological wall here, it's going to be a virtual wall there?MIKE HUCKABEE, R-FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Well, you know, the only thing I can say is Megyn, sometimes surrogates go out and they forget that they're not the candidate, and they may make a statement --  KELLY:  But this surrogate surrogate is the former governor of Texas.  He knows better than most.  HUCKABEE:  Right.  Rick Perry used to talk a lot about the fact that a good bit of the wall on the Texas side of the border would be, in fact, electronic.  If you've been to the border -- and I think you have, and I've been to the San Diego border and to the Texas border.  There's some places where a physical wall, fence is very, very significant.  KELLY:  Right.HUCKABEE:  The best one that we have is the one around San Diego.  It's the one that stopped illegal immigration by 90 percent since it was built.  It's been tremendous.  It's not only physical, it is also electronic.  So it's not an either or, it's a both.  So when people say that --  KELLY:  So what is the need to sort of come out and tweak the issue just as Trump is getting poked himself for softening the issue of what we're going to do with the 11 million illegal immigrants?  Is this all about outreach to so-called moderates or people who aren't already on the Trump train?HUCKABEE:  I don't think the surrogates are serving Donald Trump very well if they try to undermine his basic message, which is the wall.  But the bigger picture here -- and I think a lot of people are losing sight of this -- is that is there is a real clear choice in the issue of immigration.  Donald Trump is going to build a wall.  Donald Trump is going to end sanctuary cities.  Donald Trump is going to make sure that we have a clear direction about who is coming into this country.  Hillary Clinton is for sanctuary cities.  She's for open borders.  She's going to be the Angela Merkel of the United States.  I mean I think it's pretty clear that if you want open borders and sanctuary cities, you go with Hillary.  If you want strong borders and if you want someone to actually enforce our laws, you want Donald Trump.  That's what it's going to come down to, and what the surrogates say, it's not going to make that much difference.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.  Governor, great to see you.  With all due respect to yourself as a surrogate.  HUCKABEE:  Thanks a bunch.  KELLY:  Also with us on this tonight, Ben Domenech, publisher of The Federalist.  Ben, good to see you.  BEN DOMENECH, PUBLISHER, THE FEDERALIST:  Good to be with you.KELLY:  So, I don't know.  You tell me whether this is just a coincidence or whether this is a message that was intentionally put out there to would- be Trump voters who are, like, he's too hard line.  DOMENECH:  You know, I'm really not sure that there was a lot of thought put into this from the perspective of the sloganeering, but this is an example of slogans running smack into a brick wall of their own in the sense that the slogan of building the wall sounds very nice.  But if you've been along the border as I have with Texas Senator John Cornyn back in the day, you know that the topography there actually is challenging when it comes to building a wall.  In fact, much of the issue is the fact that about half the border, which is made up of the Rio Grande in Texas, would be a situation where if you built a wall there that was as high and as significant as the one that Trump has described --  KELLY:  Thirty feet.  DOMENECH: -- would cut off Texas land owners access to the water there.   And that's something that I think really would prevent it.  KELLY:  Then that's what Rick Perry was saying.  DOMENECH:  Exactly.KELLY:  He said, there's some that's there.  This is going to be 1,200 miles from Brownsville to El Paso, 30 foot high.  And listen, I know you can't do that.  But the question is whether we are seeing an overall softening, whether it's, you know, in combination -- if this were just sort of a one off, OK, it's a clarification of what exactly the wall is.  But it comes on the heels of Trump saying to Hannity last week, there's going to be a softening.  And he kind of tried to dial it back but he was already well out on that limb about, hey, okay, now it's we're going to secure the border first, and then only after that's secure, are we going to talk about the 11 million?  Which sounds really familiar.  I've heard that elsewhere.  DOMENECH:  I have as well.  The thing to keep in mind Megyn is why people want a wall in the first place.  You can tell whether a wall is there or not.  It's not a group of bureaucrats in Washington saying, the border is secure.  It's either there or it isn't.  That's why voters have supported and it that's the reason that he became the Republican nominee.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.  But on the 11 million, I mean, that position of we secure the border first and then we talk about the 11 million is basically what every single candidate running for president had on the Republican side, is it not?DOMENECH:  It really is, and it's one of the reasons why I think that you see the kind of muddying now, the confusion among some of Trump's supporters who are basically saying to themselves, was he just trying to pull another con job on us?  Is this a situation where we can trust him on this issue?  One that has been a signature of his to this point?KELLY:  All right.  We're going to hear more about it from the candidate himself on Wednesday, who will clarify his positions on all of this.  We'll look forward to that.  Ben, great to see you.  DOMENECH:  Good to be with you.  KELLY:  All right.  There is new controversy erupting over race in America, involving both Beyonce and the message she brought to the awards that we just saw, and Colin Kaepernick, the star quarterback who is now refusing to stand for the national anthem, arguing that the American flag represents oppression.  Pete Hegseth and Eric Guster weigh in, next.    (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Developing tonight, the debate over race and law enforcement heating up again following some highly controversial protests from a couple of highly paid famous faces. It all started Friday night when multi-million dollar NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem, to protest what he calls the oppression of black people.And then last night at the Video Music Awards, Beyonce's performance appeared to show angels being shot dead, collapsing into a pool of make- believe blood, which viewers believe was meant to represent police brutality. Trace Gallagher has the new fallout tonight, Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, this is Colin Kaepernick's sixth year in the NFL but the first year he's decided to sit for the national anthem. He said it took time for him to decide how to express himself. And even if he loses endorsements or his job, he says he is not changing his tune. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)COLIN KAEPERNICK SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS QUARTERBACK: When there's significant change and I feel like that flag represents who it's supposed to represent and this country is representing people the way it's supposed to, I'll stand.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Across the country, most support his right to protest. Some even support the protest itself, but much of the reaction has been very angry from fans burning his jersey to fellow players calling him out. New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees saying, quote, ""It's an oxymoron that you're sitting down disrespecting that flag that has given you the freedom to speak out."" Kaepernick has clarified his comments saying, he has great respect for the military, but listen to a gold star mom talking about the flag and her son who was killed in Afghanistan.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TERI JOHNSON, GOLD STAR MOTHER: The flag that I see is the flag that draped my son's casket in honor and I see the flag that was handed to my husband and I with deep respect from a grateful nation. When I look at the flag, I see the best of us.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: At the Video Music Awards, Beyonce made her own statements, first by using the song ""Pray You Catch Me"" to pay tribute to Trayvon Martin, and continued the medley with red lights and gunshots with the dancers falling one by one, a clear allusion to police shootings and the Black Lives Matter Movement. We should finally note, Megyn, that if Colin Kaepernick loses his job, it will not be because of his protest. His performance on the field has continued to slide. Megyn.KELLY: Trace, thank you. Joining us now, Pete Hegseth, a Fox News contributor as well as a veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and Eric Guster, an attorney and political commentator. Great to see you both. Pete, your reaction when you saw Kaepernick refuse to stand as a war vet yourself.PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Ungrateful. Uninformed about what that flag really means. I use the basic test of conduct as what you're doing something you would do in front of your own mother? In this case, would you do that in front of the graves of the fallen? In front of that Gold Star mother? In front of wounded veterans? In front of the families of fallen cops who have given so much for that flag? Listen, you want to protest? You got issues with this country, fine. You could protest.They purchased that right for you. But have enough respect, enough gratitude for the freedom you have to do that, to stand, look at that flag, and salute it, understanding that we all work to make it better. This country has had problems with race. We understand that. We can fix it and improve it. But have some gratitude. Have some respect. Stand up. Salute the flag and show some respect for the country that we should all love.KELLY: What about that, Eric? You know, no one ever claimed that America was perfect, but we love our country. We respect our country, and the core values for which we stand, and we respect the sacrifices men and women in uniform have made to protect what we stand for. And that's why people rise to their feet. You don't have to sign on to everything happening in the United States at the time.ERIC GUSTER, ATTORNEY AND POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: But if a person is aggravated about the things such as oppression that Colin Kaepernick spoke so eloquently about, they have the right to protest. And the rights that people died for are not necessarily...KELLY: There's no question he has the right.GUSTER: ...and that is why so many Americans...KELLY: He has the right.GUSTER: So many Americans do not enjoy those rights.KELLY: The question is whether he should have done it.GUSTER: Oh, yes, he should have done it because it takes people like Colin Kaepernick, like Beyonce, to speak out about oppression, to speak out about people not being treated fairly, to speak out about inequality in the school systems, in race relations, in police protection because these people, yes, they have money. People have said, oh, they have $60 million types of contracts, but those are the people who get the attention to bring the attention to the issues because if he did not talk about it, if he did not protest it, we may not be talking about this right now.KELLY: Go ahead Pete.HEGSETH: Eric, we've been talking about it. We've had a gigantic national conversation. This is -- if you want to talk about race, you want to talk about people that have seen past race, this guy's mother and his black father abandoned him. Two white parents took him in and gave an opportunity to rise, have social mobility, in a country that doesn't...GUSTER: So because two white people took him in, that's an excuse?HEGSETH: No, not an excuse. Let's see past race and give everybody an opportunity. We all live in a police state...GUSTER: When you are a black man, Pete...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Hold on, Eric.HEGSETH: ...oppressed by the police.KELLY: Go ahead Eric.GUSTER: When you are a black man, you can't see past race because people are seeing you as a threat. When you go into a store, you're followed. When you're driving, you have a higher rate -- higher chance to be stopped and harassed by police. You have much more of a chance to be shot by police. That is the reality of being a black man like I am. I'm in Birmingham, Alabama, right now. The seed of civil rights, the place where civil rights was fought and is constantly being fought right now, Pete.HEGSETH: I acknowledge that.GUSTER: You cannot try to lecture someone about this.KELLY: Hold on Pete. OK, go.HEGSETH: I can't put myself in your shoes every day Eric, but 53 years ago, Martin Luther King gave a speech about talking about how he wants his four children to be judged by the content of their character, not the color of their skin and the more we emphasize the color of skin and emphasize racial differences, we get further away from that dream. Why are we talking more and more about what separates us as opposed to the equal justice we should appeal to?Martin Luther King appealed to our founding premise when searching for equality. Colin Kaepernick could make that same case, hey, let's do better in a way that doesn't demean our country, which is exactly what he does when he sits on his pathetic butt on the sidelines before a game rather than saluting a flag which many died to preserve, including those in the civil rights era who wants to fulfill the pride (ph) and promise.KELLY: What about that Eric, the Gold Star mom's -- Eric, with the Gold Star mother's reaction, you know, her son was killed and they gave her that American flag to honor his sacrifice and all he died for. And there are a lot of -- unfortunately a lot of Gold Star families just like her who felt disrespected in that moment.GUSTER: And I understand that because they paid the ultimate sacrifice. But that sacrifice is based upon the right to protest just like Colin Kaepernick did. So many people have fought black, white, Asians, Hispanics, have all fought in our army and our armed forces, but that gives him the right, and that's the most important thing. We are under protection of equal rights, but we simply don't have them and it's based upon the color of your skin.HEGSETH: Just because he has the right doesn't make it right and I think that's what a lot of people feel in this instance.KELLY: All right guys, thank you both.HEGSETH: Thanks.GUSTER: Thank you.KELLY: Also tonight, the University of Chicago taking a stand when it comes to the cupcakes on campus. And James Rosen has the school's powerful anti- p.c. message for incoming students. I wish I were 18 years old again and much smarter than I actually was and was applying to schools. That's where I wanted to go, University of Chicago. I never could have gotten in there.Plus, a Trump tweet raises eyebrows and makes headlines with how he reacted to the murder of an NBA star's cousin. Chris Stirewalt on whether tweets like this helps or hurts Trump's outreach message efforts. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: New reaction tonight to a weekend of street violence that closes out the deadliest month in Chicago in nearly two decades -- and that's saying something. From Friday through Sunday, gun violence left at least 10 dead and 60 wounded. Think about that. Among the murdered is Nykea Aldridge. She's a Chicago native and cousin of Chicago Bulls star Dwayne Wade. The killing of this mother of four was quickly mentioned by Donald Trump, and the story took off from there. Mike Tobin has more live from Chicago, Mike.MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CHICAGO-BASED CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Megyn. This sad murder got political rather quickly. Jesse Jackson just weighed in again calling for a White House conference on violence. But as you mentioned, it was Donald Trump who dragged it into the arena both over Twitter and on the stomp (ph).His Saturday tweet read ""Dwayne Wade's cousin was shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I've been saying. African-Americans will vote Trump."" And one today reading, ""Inner city crime is reaching record levels. African-Americans will vote for Trump because they know I will stop the slaughter going on.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Failed Democratic policies. The policy of Hillary Clinton have created this high crime and crushing poverty, absolutely crushing poverty in so many communities under democratic control. We have bad schools, no jobs, high crime, and no hope. It can't get any worse.EDDIE JOHNSON, CHICAGO POLICE SUPERINTENDENT: As far as what Mr. Trump said, I don't have a whole lot of comment on that. If you have a magic bullet to stop the violence anywhere, not just in Chicago but in America, then please share it with us.(END VIDEO CLIP)TOBIN: The suspects in this case, the Sorrells brothers, Derren and Darwin, career criminals at age 26 and 22, both violent felons. Both according to police, documented gang members. Both of them out on parole. One of them wearing his ankle monitor at the time of the shooting. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says they're examples of people who don't do their whole sentence, don't care who they shoot, and don't fear the consequences of their actions, certainly not from the justice system.A spokesman for the police says 64 people were shot this weekend in Chicago. Eight of them died of their wounds and an overwhelming majority of them were known to police because the people involved in the shootings are often the targets of the shootings. Still the spokesman complains all police can do is arrest them. They cannot keep violent -- they cannot make violent criminals do their entire sentence, Megyn.KELLY: Mike, thank you. Joining us now with more, Fox News digital politics editor Chris Stirewalt, Chris, good to see you. So, Trump came under fire for the charge was that he politicized this murder by immediately coming out and writing what he wrote. It was a while later that he came out to say, you know, my condolences -- several hours after the initial tweet -- my condolences to Dwyane Wade and his family. We've seen politicians do it before.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Racial outreach for white politicians especially is tricky, whether it's on the city, state, or federal level. This is not easy to do. Now, obviously you don't do it that way. You don't do it. You don't jump on something so fast and politicize murder, especially when you're talking about something, when you're talking about so many people in Chicago, et cetera, et cetera.It is part of a larger piece for Trump but I think is good for him and is helpful for his cause, and that is not that he's going to do particularly well with black voters. When we see him headed to Detroit this weekend for more outreach into the black community, it's not that we expect him to do well or even better particularly with black voters.But it is that he can assuage the consciences of white suburbanites who are worried about the fact Hillary Clinton says he's a racist. Much of the press says he's racist. And so much of this campaign is surrounded in racism. His very outreach to black voters, the fact that he continues to do it, that may help him with those white suburbanites.KELLY: But there's no question that the outreach to black voters is a great idea, no matter whether you're Republican or Democrat, and Trump should have been doing it, you know, for a while now. But when you look at some of the response to what he just did from the African-American community, it's alarming.I mean you come to fully understand how deeply offensive and problematic they found that tweet. At least many folks did. I'm just looking at the latest coming in. Here's something from Don Cheadle, well, this is actually from Saturday but he writes, ""You are truly a piece of you know what.""STIREWALT: Yeah.KELLY: And then it goes on, Holly Robinson Peete, she tweeted ""I'm just so offended by this, I can barely breathe. Prayers and condolences go out,"" calling him an absolute disgrace. Saw a lot of that. I don't know. I mean was it the timing of it? Was it the sweeping...STIREWALT: The subject.KELLY: You know, that African-Americans will vote Trump. What was it?STIREWALT: It is the subject matter, and it is politicizing a murder, and it's doing it so fast. It undermines that larger effort, which Ben Carson and others are helping him with to try to do this broader, more sensitive, more kind-hearted outreach that he says he wants to do, that he's trying to do. You do one tweet like that, that's what the press will seize on. That's what happened. And that is -- you rob yourself of opportunities.KELLY: Good to see you, Chris.STIREWALT: You bet.KELLY: Up next, the University of Chicago and why you should send your kids there. No more safe spaces.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: From the world headquarters of Fox News, it's ""The Kelly File"" with Megyn Kelly.KELLY: And now to the University of Chicago, where the school is defying a national trend and daring to tell students they will not find any safe spaces or trigger warnings on this campus. For more, I'm joined by chief Washington correspondent James Rosen. Hi, James.JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, good evening. You know, if you've been watching this trend on college campuses over the past several years and you've been wondering when someone in a position of authority would finally stand up and say, in effect, that he's mad as hell and he's not going to take it anymore, this is your story.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: As if parting the heavens, this mild-looking academician, Jay Ellison, Dean of Students at the University of Chicago a has struck what champions of free speech on campuses regard as the biggest blow of the decade against the stifling effect of political correctness run amok. In a letter to the class of 2020, Ellison touted the university's commitment to academic diversity, warning freshmen rigorous debate, discussion, and even disagreement may challenge you and even cause discomfort.In an era when liberal students across the country have sought and received the creation of safe spaces, zones where they can be shielded from ideas they regard as hurtful to their psyche and demanded trigger warnings, advance notice from professors when their curricula could promote an adverse emotional response. The Ellison letter served notice that the University of Chicago isn't having any of it.We do not support so called trigger warnings. We do not cancel invited speakers because their topics might prove controversial and we do not condone the creation of intellectual safe spaces where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own.GREG LUKIANOFF, FOUNDATION FOR INDIVIDUAL RIGHST IN EDUCATION PRESIDENT: This is actually one of the best steps I've seen a university take to say, you know what, this is -- education, if done right, is actually going to be uncomfortable.ROSEN: The empire of academia strikes back, however. Michael Roth, president of WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY, told ""The New York Times"" the Ellison letter was a publicity stunt designed to quote ""coddle"" donors.NOLAN CABRERA, UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA ASSISTANT PROFESSOR: Instead of saying we don't believe in safe zones, he's actually creating a safe zone, and that's a safe zone for racism, homophobia, sexism on his college campus.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: Administrators at the University of Chicago countered that they're embrace of free speech does not confer on anyone the freedom to threaten or harass, Megyn.KELLY: I love Jay Ellison. I wish my kids were graduating sooner. They're like class of 2028. It's not soon enough. I want them there while Jay is there, James.ROSEN: I think first really, Megyn, you need to focus on something call the SAT's and then eventually you'll get to where you're talking about.KELLY: Yeah, but that nonsense about you making a safe space for racism and sexism -- what they're trying to do is shore people up for real life -- tough conversations on difficult subjects, which we have to deal with in real life.ROSEN: I consider this conversation itself one of those right now, and I think I had trigger warnings somewhere around 4:00 today. But, look, the University of Chicago points out that the professors there retain, as they put it, broad freedom in how they address any concerns their students may have about the curriculum. So, if a professor really wants to give a trigger warning, he or she may do so.KELLY: That's like my dianetics only it's true and not weird. Still up, Gene Wilder. Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Tonight we bid goodbye to a legend. Actor Gene Wilder has passed away at the age of 83 from complications of Alzheimer's disease. While many remember him for iconic roles in films like ""The Producers,"" ""Blazing Saddles,"" ""Silver Streak"" and ""Young Frankenstein,"" for many of us, while there will always be the larger than life candy man who delivered pure imagination in the beloved classic ""Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GENE WILDER, ACTOR (SINGING): Come with me, and you'll be in a world of pure imagination. Take a look, and you'll see into your imagination.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That film meant so much to me growing up and still does. We have one movie poster in our home right now, and it is from Wonka. I love the escape it offered to a world where good triumphs over nastiness and where no dream is too big.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILDER: But Charlie, don't forget what happened to the man who suddenly got everything he always wanted.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What happened?WILDER: He lived happily ever after.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Gene wilder, bless you. And from this girl from upstate New York who you helped convince that anything is possible, thank you.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
