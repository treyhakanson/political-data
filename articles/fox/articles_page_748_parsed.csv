"And now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine...Stunning LossOne political commentator is blaming last week's stunning primary loss -- for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor -- on the fact he is Jewish.New York Times political writer and CNBC Chief Washington Correspondent John Harwood -- made the comment on PBS.Quote -- ""Eric Cantor is a Jewish Republican. This is a very rural conservative southern district where that is not a -- you don't have a lot of Jewish members of Congress from the South.""Host Gwen Ifill countered Harwood's presumption --noting Cantor has been elected several times from the district.Political commentators have come up with a laundry list of possible reasons for Cantor's defeat -- including his moderate stance on immigration -- not spending enough time in his district -- and his focus on national politics.Unfair and UnbalancedThe editor of the Arizona Daily Sun in Flagstaff -- does not have room for balance in his newspaper.Randy Wilson wrote that global warming deniers do not deserve space -- under the headline ""It's Not Censorship by Ignoring Those Denying Climate Change.""Quote -- ""When is a scientific question settled to the point that entertaining further debate becomes not only a waste of precious newsprint but also a diversion from finding a solution to the problems raised by the answer to the question?""Might Have Missed ItAnd finally a story you might have missed if you were sitting in a waiting room in the Veterans Affairs Hospital in Fresno, California.The VA there -- blocked access to Fox News Channel -- claiming the patients were squabbling over the remote.The hospital's PR person says -- it had nothing to do with recent coverage of the VA health care system problems.She said Fox would be unblocked immediately-- and promised to make sure it is available in other waiting rooms.

At least, so far.January's cover of the same magazine is far less flattering.Davis was awarded the Bum Steer of the year Award with the magazine saying it was an easy choice.Quote -- ""Nothing, and we mean nothing, could match the train wreck that was Wendy Davis, battleground Texas, and the Democrats."""

"This is a RUSH transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" February 25, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!ERIC BOLLING, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Hi, I'm Eric Bolling in for Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching the special edition of The O'Reilly Factor ""Election 2016.""Let's get the right to our top story. Is Donald Trump now the inevitable Republican nominee? Super Tuesday is just five days away and Trump's two biggest rivals, Senator Ted Cruz and Senator Marco Rubio are firing everything they have got to try to stop him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We can't be fooled by P.T. Barnum.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)The time for the clowns and the acrobats and the dancing bears has passed.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Trump has actually alluded to the fact that he thinks parts of ObamaCare are pretty good.(CROWD BOOING)I can tell you everybody running for president tells you, I want to get rid of ObamaCare. I want to get -- I'm the only one that's ever done anything about it meaningful.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Meanwhile, Bill O'Reilly put it this way last night about Trump's tightening grip on the G.O.P. nomination.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL O'REILLY, FOX NEWS HOST, ""THE O'REILLY FACTOR"": In the end Donald Trump doesn't care about politics. He doesn't care about parties. He does not care about elites. He does not care what he says in attacking opponent. He only cares about one thing. Winning.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Joining us now with reaction from Nashville, the Tea Party News network Scottie Nell Hughes and with me in studio Kellyanne Conway, the head of a pro-Ted Cruz Super PAC.All right. Let me start with you Kelly, and you are here right here in the studio. So, people have said, what have you guys -- what have you been waiting for now you are finally going after Donald Trump? Do you like the way it's working out?KELLYANNE CONWAY, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER AND STRATEGIST: Well, Senator Cruz is taking on Donald Trump himself as is the campaign. At our Super PAC, we are still bolstering Senator Cruz's image through filling in the blanks of his career before he got to the Senate.BOLLING: What are you waiting for?CONWAY: No, and --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Got to go, time is running out. There's five days before Super Tuesday.CONWAY: Right. Well --BOLLING: Six hundred delegates are going to go on Super Tuesday and you still filling out his career?CONWAY: No, no, no, no, no. Let me start over here, Eric. We have been running as many about Senator Rubio, something about Mr. Trump and many about Senator Cruz. But the question of is, is he inevitable? Of course he is not. Five percent of all delegates have already been cast. Only 133 have been awarded, there will be over 2500 that are eventually rewarded. Let's not be disrespectful to all of the voters except for these first four states that have cast ballots and deprive them of their voice in choosing their nominee. Mr. Trump is prohibitive frontrunner at this moment. That he is in no way inevitable. I think if Senator Cruz gets Mr. Trump to himself, then you're going to have the two anti-establishment outsiders.BOLLING: So, you're calling for Rubio to drop out?CONWAY: Well, sure, he said, he can't win anything in Florida and Trump is beating him by 16 points today.BOLLING: So Scottie, Donald Trump is looking at Senator Cruz and Senator Rubio taking shots at each other, beating each other senseless and saying, you know, I'm all right with this because I keep winning states. Is Donald Trump the inevitable?SCOTTIE NELL HUGHES, TEA PARTY NEWS NETWORK: He is the inevitable. I mean, I agree. Let's not look past the upcoming states. I'm in a state that is voting on Tuesday. But guess what, in my state, in almost every single state, Mr. Trump is winning, he's ahead of the polls by double digits in almost every single state. And now, according to the latest Dallas ABC poll, he is tied with Senator Cruz at 32 percent.Listen, Texas is one of the odd states that you have to be above 50 percent of the vote counts and then you get 100 percent of the delegates. Senator Cruz is a far away point from that and he only said that he needed to win South Carolina. He did not win a single county in there. That what was he was hoping to beat, his Bill Clinton moment that would sweep him into the south. That would get the momentum going for the rest of the country. It hasn't started and it doesn't look like it has any chance or of even starting at this point.BOLLING: Kellyanne, I do the math. I look at these things. I do the delegate math and it comes down to and Scottie Nell points this out, does Senator Cruz not only take Texas but take a lot, it's a proportional state, if he doesn't take a vast majority of Texas. I can't see a path to the nomination.CONWAY: Why? There are other states voting that day. Arkansas, Georgia - -BOLLING: And Trump has a lead --CONWAY: And he's not leading in any of them.BOLLING: He has a big lead in almost -- in 12 of the 14 states and territories that are going to vote.CONWAY: Right. No doubt. Well, I'm going to respect the right of the citizens in the state to cast their ballots and show their preferences on Tuesday. There is another poll just to correct the record -- there is another poll out today that shows Senator Cruz leading Mr. Trump by -- there's a Monmouth poll that says Mr. Trump only likes to quote the Monmouth poll. The Monmouth poll shows Cruz leading Trump in Texas by 15 points. Senator Cruz has the best chance of winning his home state when you compare him to Rubio and Kasich. Rubio is losing by 16 points to Mr. Trump.Kasich is behind in Ohio. So, that's why I think the two anti- establishment, anti-Washington outsider candidate and Trump and Cruz will do very well on Super Tuesday. That's a 155 delegates. From the last couple days of Senator Cruz must win Texas or he's done to now he has said the vast majority. He's also competing in other states. We'll get his public schedule. He'll be in five or six of the states between now and Tuesday. He is competing in many Super Tuesday states. As opposed to Senator Rubio who should just drop out and let Cruz and Trump really battle it out. Why? He was asked what state can you win and he says, oh, Florida on March 15th. So, we're going to skip. All of Super Tuesday. The first four contests in February, March 5th contest, March 8th contest, until Rubio can find a state he can win. That's not a winner.BOLLING: So, go ahead Scottie Nell, the Cruz campaign would love to see the Rubio campaign drop out but it didn't seem like Rubio is dropping.HUGHES: Absolutely. No, they're not. And actually we can talk to people. You know, Marco Rubio is having some really good momentum in some of these states, including my own. But it's still not enough. While you, Kellyanne are sitting here looking at these states that are coming up on Tuesday and just like praying that something will change and uphold --CONWAY: I'm not praying.HUGHES: Well, you have to be doing something. Because after you saw the Cruz campaign, he is not going to attend an event in Alabama on Saturday morning. He is going to Texas. You are hearing things of, most all of his work is going into Texas. His home state which by the way he should be blowing out every single poll but he is not. It reminds me a little bit of Al Gore in Tennessee when he lost this states. But instead you've got Mr. Trump being asked about, who do you want as your vice presidential candidate to run with you? That right there shows where the American people have moved on. I'm waiting for the Cruz campaign to kind of get the hint and instead of maybe -- instead of continuing to divide our conservative movement, they will start speaking positively about uniting us and going against Hillary and Bernie.CONWAY: Well, uniting us and so all these personal insults against Senator Cruz is supposed to then lead to uniting us. But let me just say --HUGHES: You just had a communication director that have to resign.CONWAY: Bill Clinton lost first four contests in 1992.(CROSSTALK)HUGHES: -- throw that mud at Mr. Trump.BOLLING: Scottie, hold on. Go ahead, Bill Clinton, what?CONWAY: Bill Clinton lost the first four contest in 1992. His first win was on Super Tuesday in Georgia. He went on to be the democratic nominee and a two term president. So, the entire point is, we don't disrespect people and vote in states that haven't voted yet. We are not going to choose a nominee base on four states. One of which --BOLLING: Kellyanne, I'm doing the math. I'm doing the math.CONWAY: Should we just hang it up now?BOLLING: Well, let me do this way.CONWAY: These sounds like the Jeb Bush people --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: No, no, no, no. Listen I've seen this on FOX.CONWAY: We're inevitable. Hillary is inevitable.BOLLING: I have said this on FOX for a long time. The only way you compete against Donald Trump at this stage of the game, there are two things in politics that is momentum and time. Trump has the momentum. You guys are running out of time. Everyone, if you want to compete has to get behind one non-Trump candidate. Who is it going to be? Doesn't seem like you want --HUGHES: Ted Cruz.CONWAY: Marco Rubio says, he can't win anywhere. But you rather be Ted Cruz than Donald Trump, Scottie as a head of a Tea Party Network.HUGHES: Well, no, actually I agree that it could be all three of them. All three. You know, the truth is though --(CROSSTALK)It doesn't matter whether Cruz or Rubio. We're winning. That's the point. You guys have(CROSSTALK)CONWAY: Mr. Trump who I know well, why isn't he at 50 percent, 55 percent. If people really want --HUGHES: You know, what? If you said he wasn't -- you said he wasn't going to get 25 percent. You know what Kelly, do yourself, your present self a favor, start helping to unite the party instead of and that will help the party --CONWAY: United against Hillary and you know it.BOLLING: All right. I need to leave it right there, ladies. Thank you so much.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Tonight we welcome Republican presidential candidate, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee to our Center Seat. Asking the questions tonight, Charles Lane, opinion writer for The Washington Post, Amy Walter, national for The Cook Political Report, and Charles Hurt, political columnist for The Washington Times."" Governor, thanks for being here.GOV. MIKE HUCKABEE, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My pleasure. Thank you very much.It's been an interesting couple of days as we are learning more about this situation in San Bernardino. Even though we now know from officials in the U.S. government that at least one of these shooters pledged allegiance to ISIS, and there are many other connections that are being talked about, the White House again today was reticent to call it terrorism as of yet. And in fact, Josh Earnest went back to an argument he made yesterday. Just take a listen to today?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Why on earth do we think it's a good idea for somebody that the government thinks is too dangerous to board a plane be allowed to buy a gun? It doesn't make any sense. But once again Republicans blocked legislation that would make that illegal.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Your reaction to that and the White House response?HUCKABEE: Was there any indication that either one of these shooters were unable to board a plane? No, there was not. In fact they were fully vetted. They were able to come back into the country. She had a passport, she had a visa. This nonsense, well, they wouldn't have been able to buy guns. This is the false argument that this White House has made in an attempt to dodge the real issue. There are people who are trying to kill us. They're Islamic jihadists. I don't know why they can't just come up and say it. They wouldn't say it after Little Rock, they wouldn't say it after Fort Hood, they wouldn't say it after Oklahoma City. You have the Boston Marathon. How many times does this have to happen?He keeps asking us, how many times do he we have to have mass shootings to get gun control. I would like to ask him, how many times do we have Islamic jihadist terrorist attacks and him not be able to acknowledge what we're fighting against?BAIER: On the specific issue since they keep coming back to it, what about someone on the terrorist watch list, should they be allowed to buy a gun?HUCKABEE: The problem is most of the time it is a name, not a background. It's the full identity. So I've had friends, I'm sure all of us have, friends who ended up on the list because their name was the name of somebody that might have a suspicion, not necessarily even so much as a probable cause. But they were on the no-fly list and it took them months if not a couple of years to get off of it. In the meantime their lives were a living hell.Why would you put people through that if you can't at that point really say that this is a person you're suspecting of terrorist activity, even suspecting of criminal activity?BAIER: Charlie?CHARLES HURT, THE WASHINGTON TIMES: Governor, you know, we've seen this in Paris and in San Bernardino, this concept of the more home-grown jihadists, it's kind of you know, more alarming I think than when they're foreign. How do you get at that as the government?HUCKABEE: How does the government get to that? I'm not sure that the government ever can completely understand what causes a person to be that demented, that off his rocker, because I don't think that any rational, sane person can think in those terms, except that if you are a religious fanatic about something and you believe that it is your God-given duty to go out and kill people because they're infidels, then you can convince yourself. But then it becomes a theological issue, not just a psychological issue.BAIER: Amy?AMY WALTER, THE COOK POLITICAL REPORT: I want to just pull it back and talk about ISIS in a broader sense. We've had a lot of discussion now with the Republican candidates taking sides about what to do about Assad -- keep him there, at least he helps fill a vacuum that would get filled without him there with radical jihadists, or take him out. Where are you on this?HUCKABEE: Assad is not our immediate problem. Assad has not killed or kidnapped Americans. The Iranians have and we made a deal with them. That doesn't make sense to me.It makes more sense to me to not worry as much about Assad even though I don't trust him, I don't like him, and I don't think he's a good guy. But our immediate threat is the Islamic jihad not only branch of ISIS and Al Qaeda and Boko Haram, but those that are beheading Christians, that are infiltrating the United States and doing dastardly deeds like we saw in San Bernardino. I have the same attitude about Russia and Putin. I know many of my Republican colleagues say I don't Russia, I don't trust Putin. We shouldn't have anything to do with them. Look, my feeling is, if the Russians and Putin are willing to go after ISIS members and kill them, we should not get in their way. In fact we should thank them for being will to do that. We'll fight the battles that we have with them on another day on another platform. Right now the immediate threat we have is let's get rid of this malignant cancer and cut it out before it metastasizes and kills more Americans.BAIER: Chuck?CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: I was going to pick up on that, because it's really not that simple. Russia, as we know, is not really striking ISIS targets so far in Syria. And also Russia doesn't do anything for free. So my question to you would be this, to get Russia actually to fight ISIS instead of talking about it, which is what they're doing now, what would you be willing to trade? If Vladimir Putin came to you and said we want you to back off of the Baltics, we want to you back off in Ukraine, we want help with that, that and the other of our concerns, what would you be willing to give him?HUCKABEE: Well, I'm not sure that we, we're in a position where we want to give him anything. I think it's a matter of making sure that he understands that the only reason we welcome him to the world stage without contempt is because he would like to do something in return and retaliation for ISIS knocking down an airliner with 224 of his people on board. That doesn't mean anything to him.LANE: He's not doing anything militarily to ISIS.HUCKABEE: I'm not sure that that's true. I'm not sure that he is doing nothing to fight ISIS. He may not be doing what we want him to do. He may not be doing what we wished he would do. But to say that Russia has no interest at all in taking any of the people from ISIS out, I don't necessarily agree with that.LANE: In return for the little bitty thing he's doing against ISIS right now, you would be prepared to say let Assad, who is butchering all of these people and driving them into Europe as refugees, leave him in power just in return for that little, bitty, tiny thing?HUCKABEE: It's not a matter of thinking he's doing a wonderful job and we should leave him there and let's give him a Nobel Peace Prize. I'm just saying that he is not the immediate target that we need to focus upon. If there are two houses, one's on fire and one isn't, where do you put the water? You put the water on the one that is raging in flames. Right now what's raging in flames is ISIS is cutting people's heads off, ISIS is gaining ground. They're not contained. That's where we need to take the fire truck and that's where we need to put the water.BAIER: More with Governor Huckabee after a quick break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Governor Mike Huckabee is in our Center Seat tonight. Governor, you are a proponent of the fair tax.HUCKABEE: Yes.BAIER: And there are many critics of the fair tax. One of them is AEI's Alan Viard. AD he calls the fair tax, quote ""a big shift in the tax burden away from high-income groups toward middle income, lower income groups. And whatever you think about that politically, I think that's just not viable.""HUCKABEE: Well, he's wrong. And he takes the same position that a lot of people have taken without understanding the actual fair tax, most of which comes from a study that the Bush administration did on tax policy. They looked at the consumption tax. They didn't actually look at the fair tax, though they think they did.The fair tax empowers people at the bottom third of the economy most of all by about 14 percent, 15 percent. People in the middle third of the economy benefit seven percent or eight percent. It's the people at the top who benefit the least, still four or five percent. But because there's a provision in the fair tax called a pre-bate that essentially un-taxes poor people for their basic necessities, that it is the single most-empowering approach to taxation. It's bold. It's different, and it brings jobs back to the very people in those middle class areas who don't have them right now.BAIER: But on the back end of that, it's viable. Is it viable? Because tough get something through this Congress, and you know how Washington works.HUCKABEE: Yes.BAIER: The big ideas --HUCKABEE: It's not viable unless you have a president who can explain it, sell it, and lead it, because it isn't going to happen. It's 80 current congressional sponsors of the fair tax with the bill that's in place. It's not going to happen if you just have Congressional support. It's only going to happen if you have a president that actually can go out there and help the American people to see what this does to bring working capital back to America, get manufacturing jobs back and also help alleviate the economic incentive of illegal immigration, which the fair tax would help do.BAIER: Amy?WALTER: I want to talk about two of your proposals, Social Security and ethanol subsidies. In both cases you're arguing we don't need to have major reform, structural reform on Social Security and Medicare, and that you want to continue the ethanol subsidies. How do you square that with a philosophy that also government is too big and that our deficit is too high? How do you not have to tackle both of those things?HUCKABEE: Let's take Social Security first. That's not the government's money. People paid that in. Every paycheck I ever had since the age of 14 when I started working. No one asked me if I wanted to give that money into an account at the Social Security fund. It was taken out of me.Now you have people who are approaching the age of retirement, Social Security benefits, and then somebody says, hey, we're going to extend the age at which you retire. And oh, and by the way, we're going to means test you. All that money you put in, you may not need it after all. Talk about big government. How big government is it when the government makes the decision for me to take the money and then makes the decision not give it to me after I've paid it in? WALTER: Do you believe we can continue on this path that we're on right now without reform? HUCKABEE: If our economy were growing at four percent a year, just four percent -- I think we could do better than that, but at four percent we fully fund Social Security and Medicare. We've got more people talking about how we need to cut benefits for seniors and how we need to rid ourselves of these programs that people have depended on. With Social Security alone you've got 70 million people depend upon Social Security. More than a third of them, that's 90 percent of their income. Rather than talk about how to trim those benefits from them. Why don't we talk about growing the economy, giving everybody's boat higher water to float in? That makes a whole lot more sense to me.BAIER: But on the second part, Larry Lawyer writes in on Twitter, he says ""Adulterating our gasoline with ethanol is a bad idea for everyone except corn farmers. Why support it?""HUCKABEE: Well, first of all, the government mandated it, and the government encouraged people to go out and build this extraordinary infrastructure to take care of not just ethanol but biofuels, which are renewable. Green people ought to love this. The result has been 16 percent lower cost in energy for the consumer and a greener outcome.So on one hand you have people saying, well, you know this is what the government mandated. This is a classic bait-and-switch from Washington. They mandate it. Billions of dollars are spent to create the infrastructure to deliver biofuels, and then the next thing you know the government says we were just kidding. So all these people who made the investments, we're going to gut-punch them again? This is why people hate Washington. BAIER: So it's not about Iowa. It's not about votes at the caucus? HUCKABEE: I was saying the same thing when I wasn't a candidate. I was saying the same thing before I was a presidential candidate.BAIER: Charlie?HURT: It is interesting you had an op-ed this morning in ""The Des Moines Register."" And I was wondering why it appeared in ""The Des Moines Register,"" but I think I know why.HUCKABEE: I'm not going to kid you. I'm trying to win Iowa. Let's not be coy about that. But it's not that the position on that was just because of the election.HURT: OK, but at a time, and you yourself have just said this, at a time when energy prices are falling, a lot of this innovation is appears to be working on its own now. Why do we -- why do I need to subsidize, why do the taxpayers and the rest of the country have to subsidize this?HUCKABEE: Ultimately I think if you want to look at long-term, we won't need subsidies. But in the meantime, as we're developing the extraordinary necessary infrastructure to make this work, my goal is to see us become the number one energy exporter in the world. Do you have any idea what would happen if we changed the balance of power, if we became the exporter of energy to Europe, Africa, and Asia, and we took that market away from Russia, the Saudis, and the Iranians? We don't just improve the American economy. We transform the very essence of balance of military power itself.HURT: So would you say you're in favor of phasing out subsidies for ethanol?HUCKABEE: In the long-term if they're no longer needed to make sure that people whose investments have been made. You know, I just don't think you build this infrastructure, you cause people to follow a mandate, and then you just change the mandate in the middle. That's like changing the rules of the football game at halftime while the guys are in the locker room. That's crazy, you can't do that.BAIER: Well, we are phasing out our time on this panel. We'll start with Chuck after we get back. More with Governor Huckabee talking politics when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: We're back with our panel, Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee. Governor, you look at the latest poll out today, CNN-ORC. You are at two percent in this poll. Donald Trump is at 36 percent in the newest poll. The RCP, the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls, you are at 2.3 percent, again up against 30.8. And in Iowa, where you just said you would like to win, you are 1.7 percent. How do you tell supporters that there is a path when you look at these polls?HUCKABEE: The path is the way it's been for the past several election cycles. I was at a number worse than this eight years ago. Rick Santorum was at a number worse than that four years ago. We both ended up winning the Iowa caucuses.BAIER: But 57 days out of the caucuses you were that low?HUCKABEE: Yes, absolutely. And that's what people tend to forget. This is going to be a later caucus because now we are going to be February rather than early January. And so there's 60 days before we actually start voting. In the meantime, you know, Trump has got a great lead, but we're a long way from that moment. And historically, it doesn't mean that if you are leading now you are going to be leading when the votes get counted.BAIER: Chuck?LANE: A lot of people in the party are saying the probable with our field or one of the reasons Trump is running away from it is there are so darn many candidates. And you are just above an asterisk. Several people in that neighborhood, or at least one or two of them, Bobby Jindal comes to mind, have already dropped out, saying in part the party needs to concentrate its fire and get real. You've been processed by the Iowa voters as you pointed out yourself eight years ago. Why isn't this poll really a signal that it's time to do the right thing for the party and step aside?HUCKABEE: That would be like asking since some the publications even represented around the table are not number one around the marketplace, why don't they drop out? Why don't they quit publishing? You're using up a lot of trees, a lot of news space. Why not get out? Why keep subjecting the audience to a bigger choice?LANE: If you were losing money.HUCKABEE: I'm not losing money. I'm gaining ground. I'm getting still the opportunity to talk about issues that matter to me. And as long as that is the case, and until somebody has voted, I'm not sure why I should surrender before a single vote has been cast. I just think it's a big mistake when people start predicting. Let me ask you this, did you think Donald Trump would be running way with the polls for as long as he has back in April of this year?LANE: No, I did not.HUCKABEE: Then you don't know and can't tell me who is going to be winning the Iowa caucus in 60 days. So I'm not going to drop out.LANE: -- already had his shot at the Iowa electorate a couple times in the past.HUCKABEE: Right. But let's wait until February 1st and see how it shakes out.WALTER: In April of this year I said that the best candidate, most likely nominee was going to be somebody who was a governor. Republicans electorate loves governors. But now the top of the charts here, you got Trump, Carson, and two senators. And the governors have not been making much of a dent. What's going on? And is your experience not what people are looking for now?HUCKABEE: Well, it should be, because, I mean, do you want to get on an airplane that's flown by somebody who has never been in a cockpit before?WALTER: Apparently the Republican electorate says yes, they do.HUCKABEE: This shows how angry people are at government and particularly at Washington. What we have to do is remind them I have never had a paycheck from Washington. Never worked and lived in the city. So don't blame me for what this mess is. Look at what I was able to do in a very partisan, the most partisan atmosphere in the entire country. Nobody had more lopsided legislature than me. And I think you want to put somebody who has actually sat at the desk in the executive office and made the real, tough life and death decisions.BAIER: You took the pledge governor, but you would support a nominee in Donald Trump?HUCKABEE: I would for a couple of reasons. Number one, I still think he would be better president than Hillary Clinton. I know both of them, and believe me, I would vote for Trump in a heartbeat.Secondly, the Republican Party asked all of us to pledge our loyalty to the party. Isn't the party not going to pledge their loyalty to whichever one of us wins? If they don't, then that's absolutely unacceptable, and they should have to answer why they don't commit upfront that they will support whoever the nominee is.BAIER: Charlie?HURT: If you are not running for the nomination, could you see yourself with the rest of the field, would you support Donald Trump? And would you look at so many establishment Republicans who have such a hard time, you know, the acrimony that they have for him, you know, why don't, why do they not understand what so many voters right now see in Donald Trump?HUCKABEE: And I would say one of the questions is, will Donald Trump throws his support to me if I get the nomination? Let's hope that happens, too. I've pledged I'm going to support the Republican nominee. I'm a team player, always have been. The party provides an extraordinary level of resources for us to be a part of this process. They spend millions of dollars building the party infrastructure. So we should respect that and we should support the party and its nominee. I just think that goes both ways and the party needs to support whoever our nominee is by the votes of the people.BAIER: Governor, thank you. That is it for the Center Seat panel, but stay tuned for some political food for thought.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Finally tonight, political issues can be complicated and hard to digest, but our Center Seat guest likes to simplify things with food metaphors.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HUCKABEE: I don't think we can just abandon the region for the simple reason that it doesn't get better with age. This isn't cheese. This isn't beef.Republicans have a whole buffet, I mean, we are the Golden Corral of politics.Politics is like opening a Baskin Robbins store.If you are going to have sausage you have got to kill some pigs.I wish I had had some meat that I could have put in that meat locker.We better wake up and smell the falafel.We're talking chicken and egg here.It's like a 400-pound man saying I got to go on a diet but I am eating a sack of Krispy Kreme before I do.President Obama got rolled like a California sushi.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: I mean, there is a lot of food metaphors there, governor.HUCKABEE: There were when you put them all together.(LAUGHTER)HUCKABEE: It really was a funny skit.BAIER: I didn't know you could get a sack of Krispy Kreme.HUCKABEE: I will bring you one.(LAUGHTER)Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.BRET BAIER, 'SPECIAL REPORT' HOST: We are pleased to welcome Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush to our Center Seat. Let's bring in our panel of questioners, syndicated columnist, George Will, Karen Tumulty, national political correspondent for the ""Washington Post,"" and Steve Hayes, senior writer for ""The Weekly Standard."" Governor Bush, thanks for being here.JEB BUSH, R, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's a joy to be with you.BAIER: Well, it's a sad couple of days obviously with the tragic events in San Bernardino yesterday, and the obviously the FBI hasn't made their determination exactly, officially what it is. It looks like the main suspect may have been radicalized in some way. Yesterday as it was happening, President Obama said this about the issue of gun control.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: For those who are concerned about terrorism, some may be aware of the fact that we have a no- fly list where people can't get on planes. But those same people we don't allow to fly could go into a store right now in the United States and buy a firearm and there's nothing that we can do to stop them.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: He's calling for legislation. You're thoughts on all of this and this issue as it develops?BUSH: Well, first of all, the first impulse I would have rather than talking about gun control is to make sure that we protect the homeland. And last week the metadata program was ended on November 30th. I think it ought to be restored. There was apparently some tracking, if he was radicalized, there were suspects that were being followed by the FBI.And this is the job of the president. It isn't to turn every instance into a need for taking rights away from people that are law-abiding citizens. We need to protect the homeland. And I think every aspect of how we go about that while we protect civil liberties in this country ought to be used.BAIER: And when Hillary Clinton tweets out ""I refuse to accept this as normal. We must take action to stop gun violence now,"" What is your reaction? Should something be done on the issue of guns? Put this issue aside.BUSH: I don't think so. I don't think that there's a national federal government solution to this. The issue of this mass violence, which is so tragic it really breaks everyone's heart, ought to be, you know, the main thing that we've seen up until now is mental illness. And we could do better probably identifying people before they go completely out of control. But there's this impulse to always solve a problem in Washington, D.C., typically ends up taking rights away from law-abiding people.BAIER: George?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Governor, you say we are at war with ISIS. Yesterday the British parliament felt constrained to vote to authorize simply an expansion of British strikes on ISIS. We've been striking ISIS now for 15 months with no congressional authorization. If you were president, would you hesitate before having, proceeding with force until Congress acted?BUSH: I would seek congressional authority. I think the president does have the authority. But I think you need to get people all in on this. We need to have a budget. If it is a war of our times, then I think we need to be serious.When President Obama presented this to the Congress, and then he backed away, he put all, all sorts of constraints on it rather than listening to the military advisers. And not only that, the three Republican senators who are running for president of the United States did not give him that authority. But I think the next president should go and get this authority, lay out a clear strategy where the United States leads to train local forces, to create, make sure that everybody understands what the clear objective is and go at it and be successful at it.WILL: On a related matter. Two of your competitors are at daggers drawn over the issue of Libya. The attack on Libya was administered by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, supported by Marco Rubio. Ted Cruz says it was a disaster. Where do you come down on the U.S. intervention on Libya?BUSH: The disaster was there wasn't a clear strategy to create security at the end of this. That's the lesson learned over the last 15 years I think in the Middle East is if we're going to be engaging and put men and women in harm's way in uniform, we ought to have a strategy to create a peaceful solution at the end.WILL: Are U.S. interests in stake there?BUSH: I don't know. Clearly, we've now made things worse by not having a strategy to create -- we have chaos. We actually have ISIS now with a foothold that's now undermining Tunisia.So it appeared to me that this was -- this we were leading from behind. We were providing support to our European allies without any thought given about the overall strategy. So in reality I don't think it was the right approach. And then bragging about it as Hillary Clinton did is pretty amazing.BAIER: Karen?KAREN TUMULTY, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, ""WASHINGTON POST"": As George was saying, daggers drawn. What is your sense of the debate within your party about America's role in the world? It used to be that Republicans you know, you would pick the isolationists school or the internationalist school. Do you have a sense that it is shifting as a result of this?BUSH: I think it's a healthy debate to be honest with you. I think it's clear that some candidates have thought it through, and one particular candidate hadn't.TUMULTY: And name?BUSH: Donald Trump. No surprise. Trump has been all over the map. He's lacking a seriousness on this subject and this is a serious matter. We're living in very dangerous times and we need someone as president that actually has things through in a proper way. So I welcome the debate. And the differences are important to discuss for sure.TUMULTY: What is he advocating that you consider unserious?BUSH: Saying let Russia take out ISIS. Let ISIS take out Syria. Bomb the bleep out of ISIS, all within three weeks' period. That is not serious. Admitting that he gets his, of course we love the Sunday show here on FOX, admitting he gets his foreign policy credentials from watching the Sunday shows? That's not serious.STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, ""THE WEEKLY STANDARD"": Getting specific on that question, Ted Cruz said the other day that the United States doesn't have a dog in this fight. Do we?BUSH: I disagree with that.HAYES: Who is our dog?BUSH: The dog?HAYES: Who is our dog in this fight?BUSH: The threat of global terrorism is the threat for our country. And every day that the caliphate exists is another day that they win and that they can recruit terrorists. And the chaos in Syria is a grave national security threat for our country.HAYES: Do you think the United States has a moral obligation to intervene when somebody like Bashar al Assad has used chemical weapons on his own people?BUSH: Not necessarily. I think you also have to have a national security imperative attached to it. We do, I think it's appropriate1 in foreign policy to have a moral underpinning for sure. But it can't just be exclusively that.In this case we have a caliphate the size of Indiana, 30,000 battle- tested, well-financed terrorists who have declared war on us, and they're declaring war on the thing we're most vulnerable on, our own freedom. And I think we have to create a strategy because who else will do this? It's not going to be the French or the Brits or the Germans, and it's certainly not going to be the Arab nations unless the United States leads.BAIER: More with Governor Jeb Bush in Center Seat after a quick break.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)     BAIER: Governor Jeb Bush is in our Center Seat tonight. Governor, a lot of people tweeted in, Facebook messages, Instagram, questions for you. Fred writes in ""The results are in on Common Core and they are overwhelmingly negative. Why do you continue to support it?""BUSH: Well, first of all, the Congress is going to do something incredible. They're going to actually pass a bill to present to the president of the United States, the reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act which I helped work on. And the net result of that is that the federal government cannot have direct or indirect, any say in the creation of standards. And that's been my position from the very beginning.I support higher standards. And Common Core standards were higher than the Florida standards that we had. They were implemented after I was governor, and high standards with real accountability and school choice and a performance based system of paying teachers will yield rising student achievement. My passion is to make sure that every child has the God-given abilities to be able to go to college or get a job, and right now about a third of our kids do.BAIER: When you hear Fred and others, and I'm sure you hear it in town halls and in the Republican Party, really concerned about this.BUSH: They're concerned about federal involvement principally. They're deeply concerned about federal overreach in education. And their voice was heard, and the Congress will pass with bipartisan support a reauthorization of the federal government's involvement in K-12 education that prohibits it. And I support that.HAYES: On the question of crony capitalism, you campaigned saying that you will end crony capitalism if elected president. And yet you look at your biggest donors, they're the Republicans who are responsible in large measure for propagating crony capitalism here in Washington on K Street and elsewhere. If you're elected, do you lock them out? How do you do this?BUSH: Yes. They're supporting me because they see that I'm a leading, that I can solve problems, that I have a proven record, unlike others that are running to have nothing in their past that suggests that they could lead.And so, absolutely, I'm proud of the fact that people are giving me money. And I haven't changed my views about anything. I think we ought to phase out the sugar subsidies. I think we ought to phase out the subsidies in the tax code for oil and gas, for wind, for solar. We need to phase out the renewable fuel standard over a period of time. All of these things I've been clear. I go to Iowa and say these things. Look, I am who I am. And my compass points north, and the fact that people are supporting me is a good sign, not a bad sign.BAIER: George?WILL: You have a plan you say for four percent growth, which would be remarkable, and sustained four percent growth. Yet the next president may come to office in the middle of a recession, we're really overdue for one after a sputtering two percent recovery. How do you credibly say you can engineer four percent growth?BUSH: If you increase the economic activity by dramatic changes in how we create rules first and foremost. The proposal we've laid out is to say that there should be two years to be able to get a permit, not 10 years, that we're going shift power back to the states wherever possible. We've treaded on the 10th Amendment and trampled all over it. I think the EPA, the Department of Education, Department of Transportation, as much of their programs, Medicaid, all of things have to go back to the states.We should embrace the energy revolution rather than trying to make it harder and harder to create economic activity. We need to reform our tax code. If you combine all of those things together, you're going to get closer to four percent growth.     And George, let's just say I got it wrong. Maybe it's 3.75 percent growth. That would be a phenomenal difference in this tepid new normal of two percent growth that is trapping people in poverty and seeing $2,300 of disposable income lost since Barack Obama has been inaugurated.BAIER: Karen?TUMULTY: If we could go back to topic A among Democrats now after San Bernardino, gun control, what about the specific proposal that the president was talking about in the tape that we saw earlier? Do you think that if somebody's name is on a no-fly list that they should be able to get a gun?BUSH: If that no-fly list is a concise list, yes, I think that that would be an appropriate qualifier.BAIER: We should point out that you're sitting next to someone who was on the no-fly list.HAYES: So I wouldn't be able to get a gun.BUSH: No.HAYES: There's no due process in me not being able to get a gun.BUSH: I'm defending you, brother.(LAUGHTER)BUSH: My point is the no-fly list is not a concise list of people under investigation or that may be for a short period of time. But if you, if you narrow that down from that list to people that are, that are being investigated in an active way, yes, that would be appropriate.HAYES: You still don't have the due process on front end, right? By definition if they're on the no fly list --BUSH: That's why you would have to narrow it down to the point where it was clearly, there's an active investigation or something like that.But that's not going to be the answer. The answer is going to be that we have to identify people before they come to the country or identify them if they're -- if they're communicating with known terrorists outside the country. And there's ways to do that to protect civil liberties in this country and we need to get back to that business.BAIER: Governor, we always thought Steve was a little sketchy.(LAUGHTER)BAIER: Another round on politics with Governor Jeb Bush when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: We're back with our panel and Center Seat Governor Jeb Bush. Governor, let's talk politics. The Real Clear Politics average of all the latest polls has you at a 5.3 percent. That is 23 percent behind Donald Trump. You take a look at the latest Iowa poll, you're at 5 percent there,22 points behind Donald Trump. I've asked you this question before as have many people about your place in the polls. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BUSH: I used to say it's a marathon, not a sprint. I think it's a triathlon. It's a more arduous than a marathon. You've got to swim and ride a bike and run at the same time. We've got a long way to go.There is a long way to as always. There will be ups and downs, as always. Herman Cain was the winner at this time when he was running.What I meant was that Herman Cain was the frontrunner with close to 30 percent of the vote, that measuring polls in October and November are completely irrelevant.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Well, today, in 2011, Herman Cain dropped out of the race. Even though he was leading, he dropped out today in 2011. And here is what people are asking on Twitter and elsewhere. MDH2 says ""Governor Bush, at which point should non-leading candidates get out and get behind leading non-Trump alternatives?""BUSH: I think we need to let the process go forward, and that's exactly what I'm doing. The pundits aren't going to decide who the party's nominee is going to be. It's the people, for starters, in Iowa, and New Hampshire and South Carolina and Nevada. And then a surge of, you know, primary states in March.And I think people just need to be a little more patient about this. Let democracy work. I am -- we are best ground game in Iowa and in New Hampshire. I'm a patient person, and I believe that we are making good, steady progress. And ultimately the decision is not going to be about who is the loudest voice, who is the biggest personality, who can insult the person the best. It's who can lead? Who has the proven record to make tough decisions during difficult times?BAIER: If staying in means that the vote is split on the non-Trump candidate, are you OK with Trump being the nominee for your party?BUSH: Donald Trump will not be the nominee of this party. I feel totally confident in the judgment of the voters, Republican primary voters.BAIER: George?WILL: Let's stay with Mr. Trump for a moment. It's almost impossible these days for a Republican to get to 270 electoral votes without Florida, the most important swing state. You know Florida very well. Is it conceivable Donald Trump could carry Florida?BUSH: If Hillary Clinton is indicted for, you know, for her email scandal or something like that, perhaps. I think she is a weakened candidate. But you can't insult your way to the presidency. You can't insult people with disabilities. You can't insult people that are Latino. You can't insult women and expect that you are going to win the presidency.I had thought, perhaps, that he would have a second act, that as he garnered this tremendous surge of support that he would actually turn into a serious candidate, but there is no evidence is he a serious candidate.WILL: Trump against a non-indicted Hillary then, Hillary wins?BUSH: I'm afraid so.BAIER: Karen?TUMULTY: At what point do think -- you keep saying there is a long way to go. At what point is there no longer a long way to go?BUSH: February 1st would be the leading indicator because that's when the caucuses start.TUMULTY: You think this stays fluid right up until voting.BUSH: Yes.TUMULTY:  Where do you think you would be right now in the polls in your name was John Ellis and John Ellis Bush?BUSH: You know what, it doesn't really matter. I'm blessed to be a Bush. I'm blessed to be the brother of George W. and the son of George H. W. Bush. And I am who I am. I have got my own record. I'm running about ideas about the future. I'm totally comfortable with it.TUMULTY: And you are convinced that people are actually hearing this as opposed to sort of stopping it?BUSH: Yes. And a lot of -- if you look at the polling that I have seen, a lot of people actually like my brother and love my dad.BAIER: Steve?HAYES: A lot of talk about the drama between you and Marco Rubio and your relationship with him in the past, and there have been reports that your -- the super PAC supporting you is willing to be pretty tough on Rubio not just on policy but going beyond policy. You don't control your super PAC. Where would you draw the line? You can tell them today what's appropriate and what's not.BUSH: Everybody will be -- everybody will have scrutiny. And that's fair game. And that's exactly what I think everybody would want. And I'm not going predict what the super PAC does. So far the ads that I have seen when I'm working out at 5:00 in the morning all look pretty good. They are touting me. They're tooting my horn, which is what I like because I think people need to know what my record is and what my views are about how to fight ISIS and those ads are pretty effective.HAYES: Did you say that working out at 5:00 in the morning thing to prove your high energy?(LAUGHTER)     HAYES: Is that a response to Trump?BUSH: Donald has got his little slippers on and tea and ornate bathrobes. He is calling into the shows at 5:00 in the morning. He is a hard working guy, too.BAIER: We'll send the emails your way.     (LAUGHTER)     BAIER: What prospect of teaming up with others like John Kasich to go after Donald Trump, which had been talked about in some analytical circles, much like 2004 against Howard Dean in Iowa that had effect. Do you think that that is going to transpire over the next 58 days before February 1st?     BUSH: Look, my focus is getting my message out, the ideas that I have to create higher growth and create a safe and secure America and talk about the leadership skills that I have. We don't have vast resources to go beyond that, and to build a ground game in these states where retail politics really matters.BAIER: Governor, last time you here you said have me back, things will change. You are back. And it's a couple months later.BUSH: You invited me too early.  (LAUGHTER)BAIER: It's about the same. What is happening in the GOP primary?BUSH: You invited me too early. Trust me. I can sense it. When I campaign, our crowds are bigger. The convert rates to our campaign are higher. People are starting to get serious about this race. And this is not about electing the biggest personality. This is about having a candidate that can beat Hillary Clinton. And I believe you cannot beat Hillary Clinton without a proven, conservative record that is a record that draws people towards our cause rather than pushes them away, and that you have the skills to actually be president, because this is a serious kind of time we are living in and you want someone who has a steady hand, who has a backbone, who has a heart for people.BAIER: Governor, thank you. Stay tuned if you will. That's it for the panel. But we are going to see one presidential candidate knock someone's socks off on the campaign trail.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
