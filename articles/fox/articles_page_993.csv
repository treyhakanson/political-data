1	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/08/13/e-mail-scandals-and-america-political-scene/	E-mail scandals and America's political scene	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" August 13, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)PETER HOEKSTRA, FORMER HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: We're well engrained with how to use this information because it's classified top secret for a reason. Our enemies can use it against us. That is why the law is so clear and why this is so important. You don't get sloppy with top secret information.JOHN KIRBY, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: I don't have any updates for you in terms of original sourcing on those e-mails.UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Has the State Department been able to determine whether each of the four classified e-mails sent to Secretary Clinton's server originated within the State Department?KIRBY: We have no indications that there were any, that there was at all any stripping of classification markings on these.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Well, the e-mail controversy investigation continues. Just to set the table very quickly again, in a look inside these e-mails, they took out of thousands and thousands they looked at 40 of them. Of them, four of them were found to have classified material, two of those were said to be top secret and also sensitive compartmented information, SCI. That is the highest classification. That is just a sample of all of the e-mails. Whether they were marked or not, that's the controversy now, but there's more to it as this investigation continues.Let's bring in our panel and start there, syndicated columnist George Will, Judge Andrew Napolitano, Fox News senior judicial analyst, and Charles Lane opinion writer for The Washington Post. Judge, listen, there's all of this stuff about whether she sent or received and whether it was marked or not. The I.G. is saying it was there. If anybody else in government had this in their system, what would be happening?JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: They would be indicted for having failed properly to secure it. I mean, last month the justice department indicted a 22-year-old sailor for taking a selfie of himself in front of a sonar screen in a nuclear submarine and e-mailing it to his girlfriend. He's no more a spy than any of us at this table, but he's facing 20 years.Mrs. Clinton is presumed to have known in the years that she was the secretary of state what is top secret and what is not. This particular document came from a satellite, and it was a satellite view of a foreign country, and it contained information, either e-mail or telephonic, that had been interrupted, that had been surveilled from a foreign country. How she could not know that that was top secret is beyond me. If somebody removed the top secret terminology on it, that person committed a felony. But she is presumed to know what is top secret whether it's stamped ""top secret"" or not.BAIER: Through all this markings stuff, are we just chasing a rabbit down a hole here? I mean, isn't this investigation going to lead to something not good?CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: Well, I think the judge put his finger on it, which is her defense is somebody else committed an offense, right? I mean, in other words, on her watch someone in the State Department people are inappropriately taking the labeling off. That's the best case scenario for her. So that means it's not a good case scenario.Sorry to get into the politics of this for a minute, but they're getting worse and worse for Hillary Clinton. You now see front page stories in the Wall Street Journal from people around Joe Biden saying he's talking about getting into this. Stories in the newspapers on the Hill, like Politico and The Hill, saying that Democratic strategists are worried, et cetera. And her own campaign manager felt he had to put out an elaborate memo explaining why this is no problem and everything is fine. And when you're doing that, that means there's a problem and everything is not fine.BAIER: George?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, we're dealing in part with the forensics of complicated electronic devices and what they can and cannot find. I talked this afternoon to congressman Trey Gowdy of South Carolina of the Benghazi committee. He said one question is, is the FBI only interested in whether there currently are on this server classified documents? Next question is, can they reconstruct this device in such a way that they can find out if there ever was a classified document on it.And Mr. Gowdy makes the following point. The more steps that were taken to make that impossible, the more likely it is that something was there. The more intentional your concealment has become. And the more steps that were taken, the more implausible it is that what was being concealed was e-mail or so about yoga classes.NAPOLITANO: And the more steps that were taken, the more people were involved, the more it appears to the FBI like a conspiracy to do something, give her plausible deniability or obstruct the espionage laws of the United States, the more likely the FBI will target and indict the lowest member of that conspiracy and squeeze, to use their terminology, that person to provide information about those north of him or her on the conspiracy.BAIER: All right, another e-mail controversy that goes back to something we've covered for many, many months. Just to recue everybody's knowledge of this, Lois Lerner.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)LOIS LERNER, FORMER IRS OFFICIAL: I have not done anything wrong. I have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations.On the advice of my counsel I respectfully exercise my Fifth Amendment right and decline to answer that question.SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When you were pleading the Fifth you were saying if I answer your questions I may well implicate myself in criminal conduct.REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO: She hasn't been square with us since this thing became public. If she's lying to us, it certainly wouldn't surprise me, because, like I said, she lied right from the get go when faced with an implanted question and she tried to blame it on someone else.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BAIER: OK, now some new e-mails have come out from the Senate finance committee. One of them ""Evil and Dishonest."" ""Yesterday was a doozy,"" she writes ""They called me back to testify on the IRS scandal. And I took the Fifth again because they had been so evil and dishonest in my lawyer's dealings with them,"" talking about the GOP lawmakers. Continuing, accusing them of hatemongering, ""They took some really awful photos of me at the first hearing last year. I looked like crap. I don't look like that anymore, but it serves their purpose of hatemongering to continue those images."" It continues, George, these e-mails, shedding some light in the inner thoughts perhaps of Lois Lerner. Your thoughts?WILL: Well, first of all as Ted Cruz said she obviously took the Fifth Amendment not because people were being beastly to her lawyer but she thought truthful answers to questions about her comportment at the IRS would get her in perhaps criminal trouble.But what we really learn from this is not that she detests conservatives. We knew that. She acted on that. What we really learned from this was the fanaticism of this. She said Citizens United, the Supreme Court decision, was the worst thing that ever happened in this country, which rather slights the Civil War, the Kansas-Nebraska Act, and the Dred Scot decision that provoked the civil war.(LAUGHTER)BAIER: How about 9/11?WILL: Lots of things. But let's be clear about what Citizens United did. All it said was that corporations and unions are free to spend unlimited amounts on independent, uncoordinated, issue advocacy. That's it. All it said was that Americans do not forfeit their First Amendment rights when they band together in corporate entities such as the Sierra Club or the National Rifle Association, to express political speech. That's it. And she says that's the worst thing that ever happened.BAIER: Judge?NAPOLITANO: I fully agree with George. I fully agree with his characterization of Citizens United. She is a two-bit political hack. She's entitled to be a two-bit political hack, but not to be in a management position at the IRS when she's approving applications for exemptions from tax regulations for advocacy groups because she has a bias against certain advocacy groups and a bias in favor of other advocacy groups. She should not have that job. She can have whatever opinion she wants on Citizens United. She can have whatever opinion she wants on the Republicans who run the House. But she cannot act on those opinions when she's administering the nation's tax laws.BAIER: You know, judge, when I talk to people about this and the IRS investigation, there's this frustration out there that nothing ever came to a conclusion. She took the fifth. The investigation continued forever.NAPOLITANO: Right.BAIER: And so what? Where are we?NAPOLITANO: We only know that this administration and, candidly, others before it have not hesitated to put political activists in positions to administer the country's tax laws, and that's wrong. The IRS needs a fundamental structural change and only Congress can do that.BAIER: Chuck?LANE: Well, I would just say I'd sort of like to see the e-mails the guys on the committee were sending around about her.(LAUGHTER)LANE: They might have responded in kind from time to time.BAIER: Do you think this investigation goes any place?LANE: No. No. And I think these e-mails don't advance it one bit. They illuminate her attitude while it was going on. But there's no new fact they can see.WILL: I think within two months the investigation may go to impeachment proceedings against Mr. Koskinen, who is the head of the IRS, for obstruction of Congress's rightful power to investigate. I think it would be a big story this fall.BAIER: There you go. You heard it here.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

3	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/08/13/very-bad-day-for-hillary-clinton/	A very bad day for Hillary Clinton	"This is a RUSH transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" August 12, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!Hi, I'm Eric Bolling in for Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching us tonight.Let's get right to our top story.A very bad day for Hillary Clinton: two major developments in the controversy around her private e-mail server. Remember when she said this?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I did not e-mail any classified material to anyone on my e- mail. There is no classified material.I am confident that I never sent nor received any information that was classified at the time it was sent and received.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: But those claims have completely unraveled. Investigators discovered that her private e-mail server didn't just contain classified information, but top secret material. Hillary has now agreed to hand over her private server to the FBI.Joining us now on the phone with reaction, the anchor of The Factor himself Bill O'Reilly, who said back on March 10th that she should turn over her server to the FBI. Bill, you nailed it. What took them five months?BILL O'REILLY, FOX NEWS HOST (via telephone): Well, the FBI didn't get involved and they were hoping -- the Clintons were hoping that they wouldn't. But you have to give credit to Loretta Lynch and to Comey, the FBI director. They finally after the inspectors-general, two of them said, look, our cursory investigation shows that there was classified material on her private server.Then the Justice Department got into it and Mrs. Clinton had to, had to, turnover her server or the FBI would have got a court order. And that would have put her in a position where she would have looked like a criminal. So once the FBI started to say to her we need this stuff, she had to turn it over and she did yesterday. So that's what happened.BOLLING: So do you think this doesn't put into question her integrity, her character, her judgment and maybe now her willingness to lie to protect herself?O'REILLY: Well, look, I think you have to look at this way. That they didn't want, they being the Clinton campaign, to turn over the server. Obviously they would have done it in the beginning as I suggested last March they should do to put her above reproach. They did not do that. They chose to try to stonewall it.Then when it came down that they had to, of course, a judge would have signed an order to get it, then it's, ""Oh, you know, no. We'll give to you after all.BOLLING: But why are they waiting? You know, if they eventually are going to have to do it --O'REILLY: Because they don't want the FBI to see -- they don't want the FBI to see what is on the server. See, even though she deleted more than 30,000 e-mails, they can get that. They can reconstitute those e- mails unless they had gone through an unbelievable process of destruction. And if they did, the FBI will know that, as well.But I caution everybody because what happens in these investigations is you're not going to hear anything for a long time. They will take the server to Quantico where the FBI has its headquarters. They will do forensics on it. They'll break it down -- they will know.But the public's not going to know and then we'll go into this campaign season really not knowing what Hillary Clinton had or didn't have on her server.BOLLING: There are two ways it can go. Number one, Hillary Clinton thinks she's above the law and doesn't need to turn over the server until the FBI goes and in and picks the server. And by the way, took the thumb drive from her attorney as well, saying they didn't feel it was safe in his hands. Or she's just, I don't know, she thinks it's not going to matter that much.O'REILLY: Well, she doesn't have any choice now. She has no choice. She had to turn it over so she did. So now everybody waits to see if Mrs. Clinton was trying to hide something. She's going to maintain to the very end that she didn't know there was any top secret or classified information. That's what she's going to say -- all right.However, if there is some e-mails that are embarrassing to her, for example don't tell anybody about Benghazi, don't tell anybody this, don't tell anybody that -- she's through. Then she's done. So nobody knows, but you know if people are starting to convict the woman I wouldn't do that. I would just say this is a victory for justice. Obviously we should know when a secretary of state violates protocol, which she absolutely did, why she was violating it.If she's innocent, that will come out. If she's not innocent, that should come out. But we don't know when.BOLLING: You know what's interesting, Bill, you say don't convict her yet, however, it's one thing having classified information that may have been deemed classified after the fact although she may not have known in 2009, '10 or '11.O'REILLY: Right.BOLLING: However we found out today that at least two of these e- mails are deemed top secret which means by FBI definition means that exceptional grave injury could be expected to befall the United States should the information get leaked.(CROSSTALK)O'REILLY: She's going to say nobody told me that. I didn't know that. That's what she's going to say.BOLLING: Yes. But how bad is that Bill? If the person that wants to be president of the United States doesn't know what is top secret and could be deemed exceptionally grave -- cause exceptionally grave injury to America, I'm not sure which is worse.O'REILLY: Well, you would have to know what the top secret stuff was and then the folks can decide. But they're hoping -- Clinton campaign is hoping that she can survive yet another controversial situation because, A, people aren't paying attention in August and, B, they don't care about the server or top secret stuff, they're going to vote ideology anyway.So Hillary Clinton is a liberal Democrat. They are liberal Democrats. They'll vote for her, they don't care what she did. That's what they're hoping.But if there is something on there as you say, Eric, that is so egregious and everyone knows this is terrible, then you can't have this in a private situation. It has to be secured. Then she'll take a massive hit. But that's again speculation. And we don't know when that will be made public.And that's really -- Congress has now got to get involved and monitor the FBI's investigation because you know how the government is. You got attorney general who I like, Lynch, appointed by Barack Obama, is she going to be forthcoming and aggressive. I hope so, but you never know.BOLLING: And the FBI certainly if they do find something that's worth pursuing they will pursue regardless of the DOJ or the inspectors general.O'REILLY: You would hope.BOLLING: Bill -- politics now. Let's turn a little bit here. Democrats have to be having a migraine headache over these e-mail scandals. Does this open the door for, I don't know, maybe Joe Biden jumps in now saying look, I don't have any of these scandals?O'REILLY: Certainly Biden is waiting to see how badly Hillary Clinton is going to falter. That's absolutely what's happening. He's standing back saying everybody knows me, I don't have to get in early. I'm going to watch.Certainly Hillary Clinton's campaign is going poorly. There is no question it's going poorly. All right. The woman is not the engendering any confidence even in her own party. All the polls show that.So Biden is just standing by going I don't have to get in now, I don't have to slug it out. Let me just stand and see how bad it gets worse for her, and if it gets worse then he'll jump in.BOLLING: All right. Very quickly -- Al Gore, I don't know, he's exercising a lot, he's losing some weight. Thoughts?O'REILLY: No chance -- won't do it, you know. I don't know what he's at -- are you going to gym with him -- Bolling? What are you doing? How do you know all this?BOLLING: I don't know. I don't know.I'm going to leave it right there.O'REILLY: Are you pumping iron with him? I know you pump iron. Are you pumping iron with Al Gore? Is that what's going on here.BOLLING: I don't know. I love the gym. Bill, we're going to have to leave it right there. We thank you very much for calling in.O'REILLY: All right. Thanks for being in for me. I appreciate it.BOLLING: I love it.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight. For perhaps the first time in this entire election season, analysts are saying it appears that Donald Trump's campaign is approaching full-on damage control mode.  Following a week of troubling headlines for the Republican front-runner.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" I'm Megyn Kelly. His campaign manager has been hit with a criminal charge after police say he grabbed a female reporter against her will. In response, Mr. Trump attacked that reporter as a liar and then mocked her. This just days after he retweeted out this photo mocking the looks of Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi for which Mr. Trump has refused to apologize. Then yesterday, Trump appearing to misstep badly by telling Chris Matthews on an MSNBC town hall that women who have abortions if abortion is illegal should be punished.Remarks that were almost instantly condemned universally by both the pro- choice and the pro-life movements. The Trump campaign quickly walked back those remarks, but as you'll see in a moment, the damage had already been done. All of this comes just five days before the next big contest in campaign 2016. The battleground state of Wisconsin this Tuesday. And a brand new Fox Business Network poll finds Mr. Trump has some serious ground to make up in that state. Or Ted Cruz is now ahead of him by ten points.  Tonight we're joined by Charles Krauthammer. Trump's spokesperson Katrina Pierson and Washington Post columnist Marc Thiessen.But we begin with Trace Gallagher reporting from our West Coast, Newsroom.  Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And Megyn, despite a contentious relationship with the Republican National Committee and despite Donald Trump this week backing away from his pledge to support the eventual GOP nominee and not to run as an Independent candidate, Trump today showed up at a surprise meeting with RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. Trump called the meeting nice saying, he was quote, ""Looking forward to bringing the party together."" But togetherness is not the best word to describe Trump's effect on the GOP this week.First came the news that his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was being charged with battery for grabbing Breitbart news reporter Michelle Fields.  Even with video apparently supporting her claim, Trump stood by Lewandowski and mocked Michelle Fields intimating that she posed a threat to him.  Trump stirred the pot more with controversial statements on National Security issues. First insisting he was against nuclear proliferation, then encouraging Japan and South Korea to get nuclear weapons. Trump also would not rule out using nuclear weapons in Europe. His comments attracted bipartisan criticism. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. JOHN KASICH, R-OHIO, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's clear that he is really unprepared to be commander-in-chief, leader of the free world.BEN RHODES, DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: It would be catastrophic were the United States to shift its position and indicate that we support somehow the proliferation of nuclear weapons to additional countries.GALLAGHER: But Trump's statement on abortion is what continues to make headlines today. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC HOST, ""HARDBALL"": Do you believe in punishment for abortion, yes or no, as a principle?DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The answer is that, there has to be some form of punishment.MATTHEWS: For the woman?TRUMP: Yes. There has to be some form.MATTHEWS: Ten cents, ten years, what?TRUMP: That I don't know.MATTHEWS: Why not?(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: The Trump campaign then tried to walk it up saying it was a misspeak than tried to clarify by issuing two new statements, first saying the states should handle abortion issues, later saying, health providers who perform abortions are the ones who should be punished. The clarifications did not placate either side of the abortion debate or the GOP rivals. Watch.Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: That comment was wrong, and it really is the latest demonstration of how little Donald has thought about any of the serious issues facing this country.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: You mentioned the FOX Business poll. A new Wisconsin poll also gives Ted Cruz a ten-point lead in Wisconsin, but it was taken before any of these controversies -- Megyn.KELLY: Trace, thank you. Well, following those remarks on abortion last night, it took less than 24 hours for a pro-Hillary Clinton PAC to use Trump's words against him. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Must be a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees.You wouldn't have your job if you weren't beautiful.MATTHEWS: Do you believe in punishment for abortion?TRUMP: There has to be some form of punishment.MATTHEWS: For the woman?TRUMP: Yes, there has to be some form of punishment.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Katrina Pierson is national spokesperson for the Trump campaign.  Katrina, good to see you again tonight. And so --KATRINA PIERSON, DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: Hi, Megyn.KELLY: You know, the abortion remarks were so controversial that he was condemned by both sides almost instantly. There was no one defending him, no one. And he came out and did a full 180 on those and now he's claiming he misspoke. To those who say Mr. Trump misspeaks a lot, he said the war in Afghanistan was a mistake, and said that was misspeaking. He said that Obamacare, that he likes the mandate, and then said no, he misspoke there.  He said women should be punished for abortion if abortion is ruled illegal.  And now he says he misspoke there. What say you?PIERSON: Well, I say when you are a political candidate for eight months, you are speaking off the cuff. Mr. Trump, that's actually one of his appeals that he's not a scripted politician. With regard to this specific account with abortion, Mr. Trump did provide a statement two actually. One on the proposed ban. Because at first, Megyn, the media frenzy was that Trump called for a ban on abortion, which in fact he did not. That was the original statement about leaving it to the states. And the second was with regard to women where he wanted to clarify that he does not support punishing women for having an illegal abortion.KELLY: Why did he say he did? Because what his critics say is, it shows he hasn't thought the issue through, and this is not something that he's given any real consideration to.PIERSON: Well, his critics are going to say anything at this point. We know there's a full-blown anti-Trump movement going on. We know that the full-blown main stream media as we saw with Chris Matthews. Everyone is out to try and stop Donald Trump from winning the nomination.KELLY: Was the question unfair?PIERSON: No, not at all. Mr. Trump answered the question, he just answered it after Chris Matthews said, but for women, and he just said yes.  Because Mr. Trump was speaking about the legality here. This was a hypothetical context of something happening that was illegal. Mr. Trump was just reinstating yes, if something is illegal, they should be punished.  And then that's why he clarified for distinguishing the difference between the woman and the actual person --KELLY: OK.PIERSON: -- committing the procedure that is not legal.KELLY: Let me ask you about these polls that show trump has a 73 percent disapproval rating with women. Seventy three percent of American women disapprove of him. His unfavorable. Mitt Romney was viewed as unfavorable by 51 percent of women before the 2012 election. He lost with women, he only got 44 percent of their vote and he was killed in that election. So 51 percent unfavorable vote, he only managed to get 44 percent of the women voting for him. And he lost in an electoral landslide to Barack Obama.  How is Donald Trump going to do better than that with a 73 percent disapproval rating with women?PIERSON: Well, I think there are a couple of things. Mitt Romney is not Donald Trump. I mean, at this point in time, Donald Trump has more votes than Mitt Romney did at this point. And, you know, when you look at the national polls, everybody wants to talk about the head-to-heads, as if there is a crystal ball. Ronald Reagan was 23 points behind Carter at this point in his general election. With regard to women, we saw this early on when Mr. Trump entered the race that he had unfavorables with women. But as people started to vote, the issues are what began to take over and of course, there is a negative perception out there. You now have Republicans joining in the war on women bandwagon against Mr. Trump. But we are going to have a --KELLY: But there's a reason for that, Katrina. There is a reason for that. They didn't just start that out of nothing. He did several things that led them to voice those concerns.PIERSON: Yes, absolutely right. He's not politically correct. But I don't think that fits with the war on women. Mr. Trump has been very outspoken against men and women. Also with praise for men and women. It's just there's one aspect that they want to focus on here. And Mr. Trump is going to have about six months to get out there in the mainstream and really show America who Hillary Clinton really is.KELLY: Great to see you, Katrina. Thanks for being here.PIERSON: Thanks, Megyn. Great to be here.KELLY: Joining me now with more, Marc Thiessen, Fox News contributor and former chief speechwriter for President George W. Bush. Marc, what do you make of that?MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, basically what it is, what Donald Trump said about abortion is something that no conservative would say. But it's something that a liberal pretending to be a pro-life conservative would say. It's like when he say two Corinthians instead of second Corinthians. It's a tale that he really is not conversing, doesn't understand what pro-lifers really believe. He said in that interview with Chris Matthews, he said, this is a direct quote, conservative Republicans would say, yes, they should be punished. No, they would not say that. And what Donald Trump does is because he doesn't understand what conservatives think or he doesn't understand what pro-lifers think, he repeats the liberal caricature of conservatism and he says it because he thinks that is what conservatives want to hear.But it's really what Liberals what to hear because Liberals and Democrats want to run against the caricatures of conservatives, they want to run against the Republican who wants to put women in jail. Not the Republican who wants to stop abortion because women are victims just like the babies are. So, he doesn't understand the issues. And so he's saying things that are utterly silly.KELLY: Let's talk about the women issue. Because Katrina accurately points out that Mr. Trump was doing poorly with women for a while in his campaign, and then his numbers with women went up -- they went up considerably. And now they're in a freefall. And the question is whether he can stop the freefall and in fact turn the numbers around again. Your thoughts on that?THIESSEN: Well, because for years Democrats have been trying to wage this war on women battle against Republican thing. Republicans are anti-women.  Every time Donald Trump opens his mouth, he says something that feeds that narrative. And it's not just this comment, I mean, it's obviously, when you say that you want to put women in jail for having abortions, they take that as anti-women. But it's not just this one comment in isolation. As you showed at the beginning of this segment, he tweeted out that horrible picture of Heidi Cruz. He made fun of Carly Fiorina's face. He said, this is a quote from a tweet that he re-tweeted, if Hillary Clinton can't satisfy her husband, what makes her think she can satisfy America?That's from the future president of the United States? And then his sick obsession with you. The comments he made tweeting out calling you a bimbo and a liar and crazy. And now with Michelle Fields. Every time he tweets or opens his mouth, he says something that alienates women. And this is not what Republicans need. Republicans are pro-women. Donald Trump projects a caricature of conservatism that Liberals are trying to project.  He is doing their work for them.KELLY: Uh-hm. Marc, thanks for being here.THIESSEN: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: So what is all of this mean in this election? The University of Virginia politics team took all of the recent demographic data and dropped it into a hypothetical Trump versus Clinton match-ups in the Electoral College. As of today, the results they came up with gave Clinton a solid win by a margin of 156 electoral votes. They'll predicting it will be a landslide for Hillary Clinton.Joining me now, the man who lead the analysis, director of the University Of Virginia Center for Politics Larry Sabato. Larry, thank you for being here. So, you start your piece today by saying, I know everybody wants me to say it's going to be close. We all like to say, it's going to be close.  Your prediction is it would not be close.LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CENTER FOR POLITICS: Well, you used the right phrase, Megyn. You said as of today. We also said in that piece that we have to deal with reality as it exists. The best indications that we have and there's some research suggesting that right about now the outlines of the general election returns start emerging. So there is some substance to this. However, it's inevitable that we're going to revise this. It will revolve over time. New circumstances. You can think of a load of things that would change at least to a certain degree.  Change the dynamics.KELLY: That can lower your poll numbers. I've never seen it happen before, but I'm assuming.SABATO: Yes, no, it could change the poll numbers. A recession, you know, a terrorist act. You know, all kinds of an indictment of a particular candidate. Not to mention any names.(CROSSTALK)SABATO: Sure.KELLY: But on the other hand, you know, Trump's numbers, as we just discussed with a core group of American voters, which is half the population of women, are going in the wrong direction for him. And it's not like they don't know him. He's got 100 percent name recognition.SABATO: Exactly right. You see, when you're unknown, you can really manipulate poll numbers. You can change them dramatically within a few months. But when you have name I.D. approaching 100 percent as both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump do, it becomes much more difficult to change perceptions. That's why we pick them. They are the front-runners.  And they're the two best known by far.KELLY: What about the theory that he has energized a section of the electorate, you know, white male voters in particular, that, you know, we've never seen before, and that these people are going to come out and make up whatever deficits he may have with minorities, with women, et cetera.SABATO: Megyn, he absolutely has energized that segment. And let me tell you a few other segments he's energized. You mentioned one, women, minority and white women and they tend to be anti-Trump. He has energized minority voters and increasingly they seem to be anti-Trump and finally, don't forget about college educated, graduate educated, professionally trained white voters. They also have tended to be anti-Trump. They're energized by Trump. So he's gaining some votes in one sector and he's losing them in other sectors.KELLY: Uh-hm. But he has six months as Katrina points out, he's got six months if he, you know, turns this thing around.SABATO: A lot can change. Sure.KELLY: To change the opinions of him. And he's a master of messaging.  Larry, great to see you.SABATO: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: So, now the Trump critics are suggesting that maybe he peaked.  Maybe that was it. But before jumping on that bandwagon, you will want to hear what Charles Krauthammer has to say, next.Plus, Donald Trump met with the RNC chair today to talk about uniting the Republican Party and National Review editor Rich Lowery and former Senator Scott Brown are here on what appears to be a very divided GOP at the moment.Plus, Brian Kilmeade will join us to report on how the State Department decided to start tweeting about spring break -- oh, boy -- and assigning women, I guess, numbers? Maybe it was the guys who were getting rated and how it went very wrong, very wrong. Girls, stop that!(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight. New polls just out from Fox Business Network gives Senator Ted Cruz a ten-point lead in the upcoming fight for Wisconsin. What's more, this is the second poll in a week showing Donald Trump taking a hit with women voters. Now some political writers are starting to ask whether the front-runner may have peaked in his support.Joining me now, syndicated columnist, Fox News contributor and author of the book, ""Things that Matter,"" Dr. Charles Krauthammer.Charles, good to see you. That's the question, whether I know others have said it many times, but whether you believe we have seen a Trump peak, and the momentum is shifting in this race.DR. CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, look, I've said it many times and I was wrong every single time. We've heard the expression ""Peak Trump"" about as often as we've heard peak oil for the last 50 years and oil is gushing all over the world. So, look, I think it is likely that he recovers. But if there is going to be one incident or one series of incidents happening together, as we've seen in this week, that would actually stop his momentum and actually put a question mark in some of his supporters, this would be it. This was a terrible week. And there's something about the abortion question. It's not just that it will alienate a lot of particularly suburban, moderate just right of center women that I think is a constituency that he has been able to hang on to, to some extent. But I think it's a deeper question.Donald Trump, people like me who have been accused of being an elitist intellectual poignant headed snobs about has said that he doesn't know anything, that his policy credentials are one inch deep, and on a ton of issues he doesn't seem to know what's going on. We, of course, have been denounced as an elitist establishment. Fine. For most issues, people say, who cares if he knows about the nuclear triad, Hezbollah, Hamas, or Quds, that's stuff he can learn in a half hour. That's fine. But abortion is the central issue of the conservative movement from the last 30 years in terms of social issues. It is a deep one that anybody involved has thought through.The fact that he could give such an answer, which is so far afield from what the pro-life people and the movement think tells you A, that he's not actually thought it through. And I think it might actually raise doubts in his supporters who have stuck through him through all the other incidents and gaffes, to say, well, if he hasn't thought through this, this central issue, what has he thought through on other issues? And what does he actually know about the other issues that we have ignored up until now?KELLY: What do you make of these, you know, the poll numbers when it comes to where he stands? Sixty seven percent of the country has an unfavorable view of him. Three quarters of women, two-thirds of Independents, 80 percent of young adults, 85 percent of Hispanics, nearly half of Republicans and Republican leaning Independents, all have an unfavorable view of him.KRAUTHAMMER: Well, the only thing you can say is that, if he's not able to change these numbers, say he becomes the nominee, then he will lose in a landslide. I know people talk about he will put certain of the mid-western states in play where Reagan Democrats will be recalled, the ones who stay home, the ones who had defected back to being Democrats. Are they going to come back? Yes, but this cannot outweigh what will be a demographic tsunami.KELLY: And we've seen, you know, some within the Trump supporters starting to openly voice concerns about him. And some more open minded to Ted Cruz and start to complain more about Trump's behavior. Even Ann Coulter was complaining about his tweet about, you know, Heidi Cruz's looks, comparing her unfavorably to his own wife Melania. I mean, Ann Coulter who's been a staunch defender of his. And the question is, whether you think Trump's behavior in the past week is really behind some of that softening we appear to be seeing among some supporters or whether it's something else that they're just starting to have general doubts about the man they've been backing.KRAUTHAMMER: When Ann Coulter calls you mental, you've got a problem. And I say that as a retired psychiatrist. Although you could argue that they cancel -- two negatives cancel each other out. But still, there's a lot of trepidation. I think the abortion question and all the other stuff that went on, the charging of the assault of his campaign manager and Trump's furious defense of his and essentially insulting the woman who was involved, the fact that as Ann Coulter has pointed out, he's mocking the looks of his opponent's wife. I mean, and doing all this at once, it makes people think as to the temperament issue, as to the knowledge issue and to the seriousness issue. In my view, that's been around for nine months.  So, as an observer, I'm surprised it took this long.KELLY: Before I let you go, do you still think that the Sanders thing is a mirage or do you think there is something going on there?KRAUTHAMMER: It's a real phenomenon. But the whole thing is been cooked against him, with all those establishment figures who are going to be the super delegates, the ones who are not elected, the math is almost impossible. I think he will be a force. He will be a figure. He will speak at the convention, and he will leave a legacy. For example, I could see him as a way of making the peace, and he would have to, because Hillary is going to need his supporters, particularly the young, he could say here is who I want as the vice president. Somebody who would carry on his legacy.KELLY: Uh-hm.KRAUTHAMMER: So he's important. He's made himself important. But he's not going to be the nominee. And he better not, because I still have no money on him.KELLY: Charles, always a pleasure.KRAUTHAMMER: Thank you.KELLY: Well, late today, Donald Trump met with the RNC to talk about uniting the Republican Party. National Review editor Rich Lowry and former Senator Scott Brown are here on whether that can happen, next.And the Brian Kilmeade reports on why some spring break advice from the State Department, yes, the State Department, is causing such a controversy.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)ANNOUNCER: From the World Headquarters of Fox News, it's ""The Kelly File"" with Megyn Kelly.KELLY: Breaking tonight, Donald Trump met with RNC Chair Reince Priebus today and the GOP frontrunner emerge having this to tweet. He said he had a, quote, ""Very nice meeting with Reince Priebus in the GOP,"" and that he is looking forward to, quote, ""bringing the party together."" But can that happen? The polls show an extremely fractured Republican Party right now that has had implications well beyond the political realm, as outlined by our own Greg Gutfeld on ""The Five"" yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST, ""THE FIVE"": From a micro level to a macro level, you can look at conservative websites like Breitbart, how much that has fallen apart since the Trump nomination. You can look at ""The Five,"" on any given day, we have tension over this nomination, over these candidates. You can look at our network as a whole, which is -- where we are having issues within a family of anchors over this stuff. You can look at the party. So in every area where there is conservatism, there is strife.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now to discuss it, National Review editor Rich Lowry and former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown. Both are FOX News contributors.Rich, do you -- do you believe the call for unity now in the Republican Party will be heeded no matter who is the nominee?RICH LOWRY, NATIONAL REVIEW EDITOR: I doubt it. This is a party that is at war with itself. Donald Trump is incredibly a polarizing figure, and has done nothing to make it better.You know, usually at this stage, a front-runner, for a major party's nomination, begins to unite the party. What have we seen from Donald Trump the last two weeks? He has threatened and mocked Ted Cruz's wife, and then said the other night incredibly that he doesn't want Ted Cruz's support. That is insane.KELLY: Senator, do you -- do you think that this party can unite behind Donald Trump? Because the latest polls show, this according to Pew, just 38 percent of republicans believe the party would unite solidly behind Trump if he becomes the nominee.SCOTT BROWN, FORMER MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR: Well, then we'll have Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton as president. And with that goes the loss of the ambassador, the loss of a cabinet position, the potential loss of the vice president if the Senate is gridlocked.So, there is a lot of losses and people have to look themselves in the mirror and say, I would rather have that than having you know, not supporting the ultimate nominee if it's Donald Trump.And here is the -- Megyn, I'm a glass half full kind of guy. I want us to get together. I want us to find that common bond and that's going to be a lot of healing, no doubt. This has been one of the most amazing elections that I participated in, and I've run 20 of them.I've never seen anything like it, where the conservatives and the establishment are attacking the front-runner. He's getting it from all sides. I mean, the people who are left aren't talking to each other.KELLY: And giving it, too.BROWN: It's unbelievable.KELLY: Given it, too. Rich, that's the thing. Is it people -- what's happening in the Republican Party right now is another layer to this. I mean, real acrimony is developing between sides. You know, those who support Donald Trump and whose who are part of the never Trump movement.And the party, they use words like ""unforgivable"" now when they talk about the other side.LOWRY: Yes. It's deep and it's hard to see how it's going to get papered over. And Scott says warns us about electing Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. But every single objective indicator, every single poll we've seen in recent weeks shows that the most likely way to get president Hillary is to nominate Donald Trump for president. For every single indicator says that.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: But you know what, his supporters say, they pay his numbers will go up once he starts on her and if he becomes the nominee.LOWRY: We'll see. But look.(CROSSTALK)BROWN: Yes. Megyn.KELLY: Wait, let him first. Go ahead, Rich.LOWRY: These numbers, 70 percent -- 70 percent of women disapprove of him. It doesn't matter how many people on the right who write op-eds and all the rest of it say they will or won't support Trump. It won't matter if 70 percent of women in this country are convinced that this guy is a disaster for them.And every single day, he's doing something to make it worse. If he wants to unify the party and begin to take steps that way, apologize to Heidi Cruz, apologize to Michelle Fields. Go and learn something about policy so you're not embarrassed by Chris Matthews asking a basic question.And those are the sort of things Donald Trump has shown no capability of doing and no willingness to do.KELLY: What about it, senator? Because you look at the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, three quarters of women view him unfavorably. Two thirds of independents view him unfavorably, 80 percent of young adults, 85 percent of Hispanics, nearly half of republicans and republican leaning independents view Donald Trump unfavorably. Overall, he has a 67 percent unfavorable rating in the country right now.BROWN: Sure. I'm aware of all the stats. Listen, you can throw the stats out all over the place, I get it. I'm surprised they're not quite frankly worse with all the attacks he's been getting from every side.That being said, obviously there are six months to go and I think it's critically important that he meet with people like he did today. One of the biggest things that I've heard when I speak to my former colleagues, is that they just want to meet him. They want to get to know him. They haven't meet him.They're relying on sound bites they're relying on stats that you're pushing forth. And that being said, I think there is an opportunity, and that will depend on who he surround himself with, who he chooses as vice president; who he starts to criticizing the highest leaders.(CROSSTALK)LOWRY: But, Senator, how about -- how about apologizing to Heidi Cruz?BROWN: Rich, with all due respect, I don't agree with what he did, OK?LOWRY: So, should he apologize?BROWN: I'm not...LOWRY: If you think it was wrong and you're a supporter of his then you're on -- you're on here to...(CROSSTALK)BROWN: Rich, can I answer the question?KELLY: What about, Senator, we've heard that, so we've heard that criticism before of Donald Trump that why doesn't he just apologize when he's wrong? Every human being makes mistakes. I have, both of you have. Why not just I'm sorry when you know you're wrong?BROWN: Well, he did correct himself recently. He did -- if I could answer the question, guys. He did -- he did obviously put a statement out regarding his misspeak and his error with regard to the abortion issue.I've already been on record with that issue with Heidi Cruz and whole host of other issues. I don't agree with him on everything.That being said, that's one of the things that people like about him is that he has the -- he's not a politician. He's not a seasoned guy like you have Ted and Marco and everybody else who has been participating in this problem -- in this process.(CROSSTALK)LOWRY: I don't think that people like that he mocks ted Cruz's wife.BROWN: He's going to make mistakes. Hey, Rich, listen.KELLY: Let him finish with his point, Rich.BROWN: Rich, with respect, I know what your position is on the guy, and that's great. But you have a choice after this is over. You can either, you know, support the nominee, you have a choice. It's not over.(CROSSTALK)LOWRY: You have a choice is to nominate Ted Cruz.BROWN: It may not be him. The difference between me and you...LOWRY: That actually know something, he's a conservative.KELLY: OK. OK, don't talk over each other, please.BROWN: The difference between me and you, Rich...KELLY: Hold on.BROWN: Rich, the difference between me and you is that I, in fact, will support the ultimate nominee for the benefit of our party and the country and you won't. That's the problem.KELLY: OK. I got it. Rich, I'll give you the quick last word. Go.LOWRY: Well, let's nominate Ted Cruz, let's unite around him. He won't embarrass us. He actually knows things. Chris Matthews could spend hours and hours hammering away at Ted Cruz and he would never have a blank look in his eyes and take a wild guess at what the right answer is on a public policy issue that has been contended for decades.KELLY: OK.LOWRY: That would never happen with Ted Cruz.KELLY: OK. Great to see you both. I'm not sensing unity, but it's still early.Coming up, when college students complained that they felt threatened by seeing a pro-Trump message in chalk, like this one, look what it says, vote Trump. The school took action. Brian Kilmeade will show you what happened since then.Plus, while the GOP is worried about getting along, new reports today suggest the democrats may be worried about Hillary Clinton going to prison.Former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy says Mrs. Clinton may face three options and not one is good. He's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Developing tonight, new reports the FBI's criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server may be nearing completion. Federal agents are reportedly preparing to interview her.And our chief White House correspondent, Ed Henry just filed this report.ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, as Hillary Clinton hits speed bumps with Bernie Sanders, but continues to rack up those delegates, the last major hurdle to her getting the nomination really is this FBI probe.Clinton vowed at the beginning there was no classified information on her personal server. Since then, hundreds of classified e-mails have been found on that server, though, she maintains they were not marked classified.The FBI, of course is sorting all of that out and now there are indications that this is getting closer to a resolution. It's such a serious case that dozens of FBI agents are working on it. And the FBI director James Comey has been personally involved getting briefings almost every day and he's known as a straight shooter.Attorney General Loretta Lynch has said she's waiting for the FBI to either give her a criminal referral or not, but there's a lot of skepticism whether a democrat Justice Department would really move forward with an indictment.Time Magazine reporting the next phase is the FBI preparing to interview some of Clinton's top aides, and then maybe the candidate herself. Clinton aide, Brian Fallon told me today, the FBI has not yet requested an interview with Clinton but they are eager to cooperate and will do so if an interview is requested.What campaign aides in general hate more than anything are unknowns. This FBI probe is hanging over the campaign as a great unknown, what some have dubbed the Comey primary. Megyn?KELLY: Ed, thank you. For more on this, we're joined by Andy McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor and National review contributing editor. Andy, good to see you.So, James Comey, you know him, you've worked with him, you say he's a straight shooter and he's going to present Mrs. Clinton with what you say are three bad options. What are they?ANDY MCCARTHY, NATIONAL REVIEW CONTRIBUTING EDITOR: Well, either she testifies in the grand jury, which is not a good option because she doesn't get to bring her lawyer in for the questioning.She submits to the questioning by the FBI, which can be used to develop leads in the case against her, but at least she gets to have her lawyer there with her to have the conversation, or she takes the fifth, which legally is probably good advice that a lawyer would give her, but politically it's suicide.KELLY: Suicide. So, what do you think she's going to do?MCCARTHY: I think she'll meet with the FBI.KELLY: With the lawyer?MCCARTHY: Yes. Because it gives them a sense of what the FBI's case is and what the government's case is overall. She gets to process it with the lawyer, if she has trouble in the middle of the interview, the lawyer can jump in and, you know, sort of delay and help her get through it.KELLY: What should we glean from the fact that they want to interview her?MCCARTHY: Well, you always want to interview the lead defendant, especially in a case where, you know, they have to prove whether she was reckless in the way that she designed this communication system or if there was willfulness involved.So, if it's a state of mind thing, you always want to sit down with the -- with the person.Their guidelines basically say that if a subject or target of an investigation wants to come in and testify, that they should allow that to happen. Now, I think she's publicly saying she wants to do that, because what is her alternative? She has to say that. But as long as that's the position she's taking, I invite her in to speak.KELLY: Do you think an indictment could possibly come down?MCCARTHY: I have a hard time believing that Loretta Lynch will pull the trigger. But on the other hand, if they wanted to whitewash the case, there's no reason that there would be an investigation.I mean, the FBI basically is part of the Justice Department. If they didn't want this investigation to be happening, they could have stopped it from the beginning.Now, you know, Comey may have ranted and raved and they may have had to put up with that. But a lot of the stuff that's happened here could not happen, like the giving of immunity to this guy who ran the communication system, the e-mail server. You need a prosecutor to grant immunity. The FBI doesn't have authority to do that.KELLY: So, the DOJ clearly working with the FBI to some extent here.MCCARTHY: Right.KELLY: And so, you can't rule it out.MCCARTHY: Correct.KELLY: You really can't rule it out.MCCARTHY: Yes. I don't -- I don't know that we'll necessarily get a decision though. I could also see her just sitting on it.KELLY: Andy, thank you, sir.MCCARTHY: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: Up next, Brian Kilmeade, spring break. Don't miss this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Well, there's a new free speech fight on a college campus tonight. Surprise. Surprise. And this time it involves Donald Trump. It's happening at Emory University where someone starting writing Trump for president signs in chalk around the campus.Before long, some students were complaining that the words, just the words made them feel threatened and wanted it check down.Brian Kilmeade is the co-host of Fox & Friends and the host of Kilmeade & Friends on Fox News Radio. He is also our original and occasional roving reporter on the campus security beat.BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX & FRIENDS SHOW CO-HOST: At least for the first story.KELLY: So the words?KILMEADE: Yes.KELLY: And the cop keys could not function at the mere sight of a pro- Trump writing.KILMEADE: Look, there was a time when you didn't write chalk on steps in school. I thought that was the story. But the fact that one candidate is written there, Trump 2016, I had no idea would be perceived as intimidation.Forty students got together and petitioned. They said they were outraged. The school wasn't listening and they're in pain because of the quote, ""because of Trump 2016.""I mean, as if Swastika or KKK hood. It's just flat-out unbelievable. But Jim Wagner seems to have caved.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: The university president.KILMEADE: Jim Wagner, university president, he now has a series of things he's going to adjust to. He is going to have a retreat. A racial retreat. He's going to have structured opportunities.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Because some of the students are pro-Trump?KILMEADE: Listen to me, he's going to have structured opportunities for difficult dialogue. That's your ""b"" block, difficult dialogue. And a full process, institutional difficult reviews and address social injustice. Unbelievable that this is happening.KELLY: You know what, they'd be better off making the students sit next to each other and yell mean things to each other. That's what you need to get used to function in the world.KILMEADE: That's the America we grew up in.KELLY: Right. Come on, toughen it up.KILMEADE: Come on, what's going on here. Why are you all of a sudden yelling at me?KELLY: I'm trying -- because I'm trying to toughen you up. I've seen you.KILMEADE: Thank you very much. We do but it is -- the alumni stood up and wrote a big thing, how they're embarrassed by the way, the way Emory is going.KELLY: Yes. I'm with you, Emory. I'm with you, alumni, I should say.KILMEADE: Yes.KELLY: State Department spring break. What did the State Department -- they're rating women? The State Department is out rating women?KILMEADE: They are guilty of trying to be clever and cool and they should, they turned themselves in.KELLY: How?KILMEADE: Essentially they said this, in a message to spring breakers who are no longer welcome in Panama City, thanks to Angelie Earhart. That have reporting on spring break. This is exciting. They are fearful that a lot of them they are teens 19 to 22 are going to go are going to go overseas.And they tweeted out this, ""if you're a 10 in the U.S., you're not a 10 overseas. And they're worried about Americans naively thinking.KELLY: If you're not -- this is a State Department tweet. ""Not a 10 in the U.S., then not a 10 overseas."" They are talking about how beautiful you are.KILMEADE: How beautiful and daring -- yes. Like a Bo Derek.KELLY: What is that supposed to mean, like if you're ugly here, you're ugly there. So, don't let -- don't get them -- don't let somebody's beer goggles fool you into thinking -- what does it mean?KILMEADE: Here's the thing. Let me bring you this scenario, you're at a bar, and you don't usually in America get much action. But suddenly you're in London, and a guy, and a woman walks up to you, she's quite attractive and all of a sudden you buy her expensive drinks or she says hey, you're cute, here's some luggage.And if she gives you luggage, you think, I must be hot. You're not hot. That luggage is lined with coc and you're going to get arrested.KELLY: Oh, boy.KILMEADE: Buy my knockoff stereo, bring it back, get arrested for buying knockoff equipment. So, they're trying to tell Americans, if you're not hot here, you're not hot there. And it's really not the message I expect from my State Depart. So, they have since apologized and they say just don't buy hot women drinks if you're not hot. And said it's sexist, they shouldn't be clever. It was so clever it made you wonder is this real?KELLY: Yes.KILMEADE: And everyone tweeted in response. So, they apologized for being...KELLY: Inappropriate. OK. So, how about, so an EgyptAir flight was, you know, we thought it was being hijacked. As it turns out it was a fake suicide belt. But for a while there they thought it was real. What did some guy do?KILMEADE: As a viewer of Fox & Friends, you know, we covered it as a real hijacking because when the plane was diverted to another place. And they said there is a bomb on board, call me gullible.KELLY: And we tend to believe that.KILMEADE: So, this is EgyptAir flight 181. And this guy is on there. Evidently, he wanted to get the attention of his ex-wife. And instead of e- mailing or texting her, he thought he'd take the plane.So, one guy on there...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Sure. Sure.KILMEADE: ... who was still on board is from England. He's 26 years old and he's the coveted job of health and safety inspected auditor. And he decides in the middle of this tense moment -- and there's video out there, but it's truly not that great -- to go up to the hijacker, get a flight attendant to translate, say can you see if I can have a picture with him.KELLY: Before he knew it was fake.KILMEADE: Before they knew it was fake. So, he said, what the heck. So, with 26-year-old safety inspector auditor sits there with the hijacker who stops and takes a picture with him with the body bomb fully in display, then goes back to his seat and calls his mom.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: You know what he...KILMEADE: And his mom said, whatever you do, don't call attention to yourself. He goes, I didn't tell her that I took a picture with the hijacker. You know what this goes to show you, this is my opinion. Do you want to have some deep thoughts?KELLY: Tell me.KILMEADE: America thinks that their social media feed is more important than the network they try to get on. He wants to be star of his Instagram rather than survive a hijacking. He's crazy.KELLY: Let me tell you something. As I see it, he has the last laugh because his instincts were dead on. It wasn't real. It was going to become a big story. And nobody got hurt. So, they're great. Good for him.KILMEADE: He's on the cover of every newspaper...KELLY: Well, there you go.KILMEADE: ... from The Daily Mail to The New York Post.KELLY: Speaking of weird behavior on planes, ponytail girl got in a lot of trouble. Tell us why.KILMEADE: Well, here's the deal. This woman had a ponytail flipped over the back of the seat. You're about to see the picture. And it's blocking the TV screen.KELLY: This is so wrong.KILMEADE: A reporter from The Boston Globe was there and takes this picture. He says ""I can't believe this,"" no one is moving the ponytail and this person is force to watch the TV through the ponytail.KELLY: So rude.KILMEADE: Well, this picture goes viral. As everyone just can't believe and marveled at how oblivious this woman is. I'm not a ponytail wearer and never have been. I didn't know you can't feel the ponytail.KELLY: You know what?KILMEADE: I didn't know you didn't know.KELLY: You can. You can feel the ponytail. Let me tell you. She's lucky that like Gutfeld that wasn't sitting behind her. Because the next thing you know she looks like this, she has this hair.KILMEADE: It's cut. Good something like that. So, that's the story that come. Well, The Boston Globe reporter said I feel so sad, I write great stories that's supposed to reveal things and one photo gets more traction than everything he does...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Because he get irritated by people's rudeness especially in public places. It's happened to all of us.KILMEADE: America likes the trivial.KELLY: Well, and honestly, like, the coarsening of our culture. And she is an example of that ponytail girl. Sweep it around the side. Sweep it around the side. They're on the side is the way to go when you have that long Soviet hotness.KILMEADE: I did not know. Right. You put it with Soviet hotness?KELLY: That's what I call it. Because you watch The Americans, the greatest show on television.KILMEADE: Right.KELLY: Well, that's how the lead character wears her hair over here.KILMEADE: I was thinking Pocahontas.KELLY: I was channeling that for a while and then, you know.KILMEADE: I didn't know.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.RICH LOWRY, GUEST HOST: Welcome to ""Hannity."" 2016 Republican front-runner Donald Trump refuses to back down from his attacks on Bill and Hillary Clinton.I'm Rich Lowry, in for Sean tonight.Earlier today, Trump continued to criticize the Clintons. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, if you look at the different situations, of course, we can name many of them. I can get you a list and I'll have it sent to your office in two seconds. But there was certainly a lot of abuse of women. And you look at whether it's Monica Lewinsky or Paula Jones or many of them, and that certainly will be fair game.Certainly, if they play the woman's card with respect to me, that would be fair game. When she started about a week ago talking about, Oh, he mentioned -- and you know, the whole thing, playing up the woman's card very, very strongly. And if she's going to play that game and he's going to be out there campaigning, then he's certainly fair game. And I think just everybody agrees with me on that.This is a person who -- you know, he's going to be out, and I like the fact that he's campaigning for her. He failed in 2008. He failed really badly.  He frankly did a very poor job at campaigning, if you want to know the truth. And perhaps he'll do well, or perhaps he'll do poorly. But if she's going to play the woman card, it's all fair game.(END VIDEO CLIP)LOWRY: Joining us now with reaction, from The Washington Times, Charlie Hurt, and FOX news contributor Eboni Williams. Thanks, guys, for being here. Charlie...CHARLES HURT, WASHINGTON TIMES: Good evening.LOWRY: ... -let me start with you because there is some pushback on this Trump offensive saying, Look, what fault is it of Hillary Clinton that her husband cheated on her? But it goes much further than that, doesn't it, because Hillary was part of the political operation that went out of its way to attempt to smear and destroy the reputations of Bill Clinton's accusers.HURT: Yes. And to me, you know, that's the heart of this charge about sexism and stuff. You know, the Clintons, you know, are trying to accuse Donald Trump of being sexist because of the words he uses and things like that, but of course, his record shows that he has a record of hiring women and putting them in powerful positions.And yes, he does use some coarse language, some language that shocks people, but it is nothing like what Bill Clinton did to people that worked for him, young people that worked for him that weren't much older than his daughter.And of course, as you mentioned, Hillary Clinton was -- you know, her entire career as first lady pretty much even before that, quite frankly, was dedicated to covering for him, covering for this horrible behavior and doing everything she could to discredit the women, the very strong women who came forward despite the intense pressure not to, who came forward and said, Hey, there's something wrong with this guy. This guy did this to me.  And she -- you know, she took -- she was -- she led the charge in destroying those people and their characters.HANNITY: Eboni, what do you think? Is this a smart play for Trump?EBONI WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think it's smart in one way. I think he's right that it's fair game, certainly. In the law, we say when you introduce something into kind of evidence, it becomes fair game.  You've opened the door for it.So certainly, the moment Hillary Clinton tossed (ph), you know, Bill Clinton out there on the campaign trail to bolster her, she rightfully can't benefit from the added component of Bill Clinton and not reap the consequences of what he causes (ph), too. So Trump's right about that.But it's interesting because Bill Clinton remains incredibly popular, incredibly bolstering of enthusiasm for much of the traditional Democratic base. And that's the thing that Hillary Clinton, despite her best efforts, still has not been able to tap into, that enthusiasm and that rigor.So I don't know if it's the best choice on Trump's part to kind of wake that sleeping giant. I said let Hillary just be defective (ph), let her be boring, let her be unstimulating to her base all by herself!LOWRY: OK, well, I don't think Hillary's going to have that much of a problem being boring on her own.(LAUGHTER)LOWRY: And in fact, Charlie, I think part of the problem with Bill Clinton campaigning for her is you see this contrast between this really extraordinary -- extraordinarily talented politician, the most natural skilled politician of his generation, and Hillary, who's just not that good at this. She's sort of a grind.And when Bill was out there in 2008, working it hard for Hillary Clinton, none of his political skills transferred to her when she was trying very hard and ultimately unsuccessfully to beat a much more natural campaigner named Barack Obama.HURT: Yes, and just as the extraordinary coalition and diverse coalition that Barack Obama has put together in 2008 in that sterling campaign and then kept together pretty well in 2012 -- just like none of -- that new coalition isn't going to be directly transferable to Hillary Clinton this year, nor is the extraordinary talents and gifts for politicking that President Obama had.And as brilliant a politician as he was in 2008, you know, there were a lot of stories back then about how she -- how he really, in a lot of ways, sabotaged her campaign in 2008, and people have wondered about it.And the single best explanation I've ever heard given for why he would have done it is that he knew that if his wife became the first female president in history that that would be such a big deal, the only thing that would be remembered about Bill Clinton would have been all of his antics in the White House and the blue dress and the Monica Lewinsky scandal.LOWRY: Do you think that's true, Eboni? Because this is a scary thought.  If Hillary Clinton becomes president, she will be on our currency one day.(LAUGHTER)LOWRY: It'll be a very big deal. And Bill Clinton will just be remembered as this transitional figure.WILLIAMS: Yes, that's interesting. Charlie makes an interesting point.  I've heard -- I think that argument gives Bill Clinton too much credit, actually. I think that what we saw in 2008 was the Clintons both just totally missing the ball, miscalculating some of the most key points of that demographic, that broad coalition that Barack Obama tapped into. I'm talking about people of color. I'm talking about college students and young people.They really took that demographic for granted. They had a very entitled attitude going after that and thinking that it was just going to be rightfully theirs because it had been in the past.And people didn't respond well to that. I think they saw backlash around it. People were accusing the Clintons of kind of being racially insensitive and kind of saying Barack Obama, you (ph) kind of stay in his place. It went very badly for them. So it was a very big political misstep moreso than I think a sabotage.LOWRY: So Charlie, let's take a look really quickly because we're talking about Clinton and Trump, and Rasmussen has a new poll that we'll get up on the screen about a prospective general election matchup between Trump and Clinton that is basically tied. And I think to most political observers, Charlie, that would be shocking but not necessarily to you.HURT: Well, no, because, I mean, the guy has really tapped into something, and it's not just angry white people. It's a far larger, broader cross- section of voters. And I think that we might find that it could very well make up a lot of Democrats and independents. But if, indeed, he is able to get these new voters to the polls the way Barack Obama did in 2008, it could be a real deal.And going back to the thing that Eboni said -- of course, I totally agree with what Eboni -- what you were just saying about that. That is obviously the reason that they totally whiffed it in 2008. But my point is that in - - the Bill Clinton of 1992 never would have misread that and made those grave mistakes that they made.(CROSSTALK)LOWRY: ... address that poll.WILLIAMS: Yes.LOWRY: When you look at that poll, does that speak to Clinton's weakness, Trump's strength or both?WILLIAMS: I think it speaks to both. I'm not shocked by it at all. I agree with Charlie. I think that on the GOP side, Trump is probably best suited to run head to head with Hillary Clinton. I think he can have some cross-aisle appeal in a way that people who would have never voted for a Republican in their life, including my own mother, will consider voting for Donald Trump because they believe that he understands the problem.That's kind of the first step here, where we are now in today's society and political climate. They feel like he's not been a part of these historical problems, politically speaking. He's clearly a Washington outsider. So those numbers don't surprise me. And I think the left will be very, very afraid to run against Donald Trump head to head.LOWRY: So Charlie, really quickly -- got about a minute left -- who among the other Republican candidates is the most serious threat to Donald Trump at the moment, in your estimation?HURT: You know, obviously, Ted Cruz in Iowa, you know, could possibly create a real problem for Donald Trump because, you know, if he does manage to win Iowa -- and Iowa is always a giant asterisk in any of these things - - it could still sort of create some turbulence for Donald Trump that he hadn't experienced before. He's never been behind really before ever since he's gotten into this.And then -- and then, you know, whoever it is that is -- you know, right now, it's Chris Christie -- whoever does really well in New Hampshire does the same thing. But -- but honest -- you know, quite frankly, after you get past New Hampshire, Donald Trump -- when you look at the state-by-state polls, he continues to look very, very good...(CROSSTALK)LOWRY: Charlie, we got to get out of here. Thanks so much to both of you.  Happy new year. See you next time.Coming up, the 2016 candidates are preparing for the final push before the Iowa caucuses. Ed Henry will have a full report.And later, Al Jazeera appears to be backtracking after trying to link NFL star Peyton Manning to performance-enhancing drugs. We'll have reaction with Brian Kilmeade and former Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz. All that and much more as ""Hannity"" continues.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)LOWRY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" With the Iowa caucuses just 33 days away, candidates on both sides of the aisle are pounding the campaign trail. Joining me now with a full report from Washington is Ed Henry -- Ed.ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good to see you, Rich. What we really saw today was the battle for the anti-Trump establishment lane of the Republican Party intensify as Chris Christie and Jeb Bush launched sharp attacks on Senator Marco Rubio. He responded in Iowa by rolling out an important endorsement, that of a conservative rock star, the House Benghazi committee chairman Trey Gowdy.They feel good in the Rubio camp because that is somebody who obviously conservatives will respond to. They say they've got a whole bunch of other endorsements they've already rolled out. And they've got polls in Iowa and nationally showing Rubio in third place behind Donald Trump, who you've just been talking about, and Senator Ted Cruz.And with Rubio sort of filling up that space there in third place, that's why you see all of these other candidates today slamming him for missing votes in the Senate, Chris Christie at a campaign stop in Iowa ripping into Rubio by saying, quote, ""Dude, show up to work. If you don't like it, quit,"" while the super-PAC supporting Jeb Bush again went after his former protege. They now have a $1.4 million TV ad buy charging Rubio was fund- raising instead of attending some important hearings and briefings on the Hill. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Days after the Paris attacks, senators came together for a top secret briefing on the terrorist threat. Marco Rubio was missing, fund-raising in California instead. Two weeks later, terrorists struck again in San Bernardino. And where was Marco? Fund-raising again in New Orleans.Over the last three years, Rubio has missed important national security hearings and missed more total votes than any other senator. Politics first, that's the Rubio way.Right to Rise USA is responsible for the content of this message.(END VIDEO CLIP)HENRY: Now, we should note Chris Christie has also spent a lot of time away from New Jersey while he's been campaigning, while the Rubio camp notes the pro-Bush ad left out that as a member of the Intelligence Committee, the senator received a high-level briefing after the Paris attacks, Rubio spokesman adding, quote, ""It's sad to see Jeb's joyful campaign reduced to such intellectual dishonesty. ""The sparring frees up Donald Trump, really, to focus on the general election, as you were just talking about, doubling it down on his attacks on both Hillary and Bill Clinton.And there's a new element now, Fox's own Howard Kurtz reporting that Donald Trump as early as next week, as the new year starts, is going to start spending up to $2 million a week for several weeks on his first TV ad buy.So think about that. Donald Trump has been dominating the Republican polls without, as you know, Rich, spending very much money at all. All of a sudden, this big TV ad buy -- that could really swamp his competitors at a critical time right before Iowa and the New Hampshire race.LOWRY: Ed, thank you very much.Joining us now with reaction, vice president at WPA Research Lisa Boothe and FOX news contributors Julie Roginsky and Jedediah Bila. Thanks, ladies, for being here.Lisa, let me...UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hi, Rich.LOWRY: ... start with you because Jeb Bush has been sitting -- or at least his people, sitting on this death star of a super-PAC that's run a bunch of ads trying to boost him, which hasn't worked so far. Now they're hitting Trump. Now they're hitting Rubio. And they're going to hit some more people, I'm sure, coming very soon.Is this desperation, or is this just smart hardball politics?LISA BOOTHE, GOP POLLSTER: It is desperation. And if you look at the ads specifically targeting Marco Rubio, it's incredibly tone deaf. Right now, there's a desire among the Republican primary voter for an outsider. How much more inside-the-Beltway does it get than attacking a candidate about their voting attendance?Voters are concerned -- they don't feel safe right now with the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, with the terrorist attacks in Paris. We have the lowest workforce portation (ph) rate since the 1970s. People care about jobs and the economy. They care about feeling safe. They don't care about Rubio's voting attendance.LOWRY: Yes, Julie, I'm sort of struck by that. The ad makes it seem as though as long as senators are attending their committee hearings, America is completely safe.(LAUGHTER)LOWRY: You know, and the terrorists will never hit us. What do you think (INAUDIBLE)JULIE ROGINSKY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, as somebody who works in the Senate, I'm very happy to hear that people actually care about what happens there, but the reality is it really doesn't matter all that much.And look, for somebody like Chris Christie to come after Marco Rubio is the height of hypocrisy. They guy can't even file for New Jersey -- you know, he's not even a New Jersey resident anymore. He's been gone for more than half the year campaigning God knows where. And for him to hit Marco Rubio is absolutely preposterous. I'm no Rubio supporter, but -- but, you know, have a little shame.LOWRY: The other thing about Rubio, he's actually leaving the Senate.JEDEDIAH BILA, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: Right.LOWRY: You know, it's not as though he wants to stay there, and you know...BILA: He's one and done. Yes!LOWRY: ... attend all his committee hearings...BILA: He's one and done!(CROSSTALK)BILA: I agree. Look, there are probably issues you could go after Rubio on in the Republican primary on issues and on policy. Attendance to me is such a silly thing to go after. There are plenty other issues if you want to get into that lane and take over from Rubio in that conservative moderate lane. But going after his attendance is really just a silly (INAUDIBLE)LOWRY: So Jedediah, if you squint just right...(LAUGHTER)LOWRY: ... really squint at the polls and you look at Bush, you can see how he's competitive...BILA: Yes...(CROSSTALK)LOWRY: ... three or four out of a very distant second place.BILA: Yes.LOWRY: What's your read on his...BILA: Oh, I mean...LOWRY: ... state of his political health at the moment?BILA: ... the desperation from Jeb Bush is -- it's alarming. Some of the worst ads that I've seen have come from either PACs supporting him or directly from him. I mean, it's just terrible, terrible stuff.And you know, it's really funny because he was so supportive of Marco Rubio just a few years back. They were so tight. This is what people can't stand about politics. They're going to look at him, and now he's all of a sudden criticizing Marco Rubio left and right, and say, Well, hold on a second. Weren't you telling us how great this guy was just a couple years ago? What made you change your mind? Well, of course, because, politically now, this is what he has to do.Look, if Jeb Bush wants to make any gain, he needs to rely on himself. He needs to be the kind of candidate that can step on that debate stage and inspire confidence.Instead, he looks angry. He looks like he's not confident. He looks like the likes of Donald Trump and every other candidate on the stage takes the microphone away from him very easily and makes him look nervous, like he's not the man fit for the job.That's his issue. And instead of picking on Marco Rubio's voting record, he should be worried about himself.LOWRY: So Lisa, you know, another thing that strikes me about this ad -- I think Marco Rubio has the most natural predators of anyone in this field.  Trump hates him on immigration. Cruz hates him because he's potential competition for the conservative vote. And then Jeb, Christie and Kasich are competing with him in New Hampshire for the non-Trump, non-Cruz vote.  So everyone has a reason to be after Marco Rubio.BOOTHE: Well, they do. And exactly, those are the things that they should be hitting Marco Rubio on. Hit him on immigration. Don't hit him on his voting record. I mean, John McCain missed more than half of his Senate votes when he was running for president.And back to Jeb Bush and the desperation factor. And look at him trying to take on Donald Trump with challenging him to a one-on-one debate. It doesn't get more desperate than that. And not only is it desperate, but it is so uncharacteristic for Jeb Bush to be trying to play this Mr. Tough Guy kind of role. It's just not believable right now.LOWRY: So Julie, Donald Trump doesn't need any of our advice. He's doing fine, OK? He's the front-runner in all the national poll. What advice would you give to the other candidates to either try to get around Trump or just beat him?ROGINSKY: Well, I'm going to give some advice as a Democrat to some of these guys. Listen up, Republicans. If I were in Iowa, if I were Ted Cruz -- he's got to win Iowa. He's got to spend his money on get out the vote efforts to get his supporters to caucus. That is much harder to do...LOWRY: And he appears to have really done that.ROGINSKY: And he appears to do that. Now, for Trump, he has a lot of support, but they're not people that traditionally caucus. It's an all-day affair. It's a tough thing to do.In New Hampshire, if I were Trump, I would go negative against Christie and I would go negative against Rubio, who allegedly got all this money that Ed Henry referred to and Howard Kurtz referred to, that he's going to spend on ads.He's got to make sure that neither of them emerge because if Trump loses Iowa and Trump loses New Hampshire, the aura of being the winner, which is exactly what he's been running on all these years -- or all these months -- excuse me -- is going to be gone. So if I were in his shoes, I would go negative on the two of them in New Hampshire and I would make sure your supporters...(CROSSTALK)LOWRY: We have about 45 seconds left.BILA: Yes.LOWRY: But this seems like the -- one of the few ""Trump is going to sink"" theories. It hasn't been tested yet. What happens if he loses an early state or two?BILA: I'm not sure -- you know, I -- I -- everybody looks at Iowa all the time. I'm not sure that's going to make a huge difference for him. It really depends on how the voters feel, on how much you have a split.I mean, his major issue is going to be Ted Cruz, I think. I think conservatives are sort of watching both of them. But with Donald Trump, I ultimately think it's going to be whether or not people believe that he is a guy that they know what he's going to do when he gets into office. I think it's going to be a matter of confidence, in terms of, Right, this is what he stands for, I'm confident that when he gets this job, these are the kinds of policies he's going to enact.If they don't feel ultimately confident in that, I think conservatives will likely shift to Cruz. Establishment voters will shift to Rubio. And we'll see where it lands.LOWRY: Great. Thanks so much, guys. I really enjoyed it. I'm not sure Jeb Bush enjoyed what any of you had to say tonight.(LAUGHTER)LOWRY: But thanks so much for being with us.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Probably not.LOWRY: Coming up -- after creating a media firestorm by attempting to link NFL star quarterback Peyton Manning to performance-enhancing drugs, Al Jazeera now appears to be backtracking. ""FOX and Friends"" co-host Brian Kilmeade and former Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz join us next.And later -- a Muslim ACLU official says it's not her job to condemn radical Islam. We'll have reaction. All that and more as ""Hannity"" continues.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)LOWRY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" It appears Al Jazeera is backpedaling from its report essentially accusing star NFL quarterback Peyton Manning of doping back in 2011. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The only allegation in the program from Charlie Sly is that growth hormone was sent repeatedly from Guyer to Ashley Manning in Florida.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So it sounds like your documentary doesn't have any evidence against Peyton Manning.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're not making the allegation against Peyton Manning.(END VIDEO CLIP)LOWRY: Former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer has been hired by Peyton Manning and told ""Hannity"" in a statement today, quote, ""Al Jazeera is backtracking and retreating. Their story was not credible to begin with, and it's not credible now.""Within 48 hours of the broadcast, Deborah Davies is now contradicting her own reporting.Joining me now with reaction is author of ""Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates: The Forgotten War That Changed American History,"" ""Fox & Friends"" co-host Brian Kilmeade, and former Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz. Gentlemen, thanks so much for being here.Now, Brian, what's your basic take here? Is there an allegation here, or is it just innuendo?BRIAN KILMEADE, CO-HOST, ""FOX & FRIENDS"": Well, what we know is confirmed is packages from this anti-aging institute, which Peyton Manning says he went to...LOWRY: Anti-aging institutes always seem to be bad news.KILMEADE: Right. I agree, but it's the Guyer Institute in Indianapolis -- that they -- they did go there. They went separately. They never went together. And the medication they did confirm was sent was sent to -- whatever it was, to Ashley Manning. That is the wife of Peyton Manning.So they said they never accused him of it, but they did say that this medication was sent to her. They didn't tell us exactly what's in it.What was done by Charlie Sly -- whether you love Charlie Sly, the guy who's seen in this video, or hate him, he did not want to be a whistleblower. He did not know he was being taped. So you can't -- you could say -- he could come back and say, I'm lying. OK. But he actually never wanted anyone to be outed to begin with. So someone concluded that perhaps he just doesn't want to be in the middle of this thing and he does say, Don't trust what I was saying.They came back and said, We taped him for 12 days in seven meetings for a total of 27 hours. We find it hard to believe that he was lying the entire time.LOWRY: OK. Well, actually, let's listen because Charlie Sly did recant on this allegation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHARLIE SLY, AL JAZEERA SOURCE: The statements on any recordings or communications that Al Jazeera plans to air are absolutely false and incorrect. To be clear, I am recanting any such statements, and there is no truth to any statement of mine that Al Jazeera plans to air. Under no circumstances should any of those statements, recordings or communications be aired.(END VIDEO CLIP)LOWRY: Now, Coach, I have to say, in any dispute with Al Jazeera and Peyton Manning, I know which side I'm instinctively on.(LAUGHTER)LOWRY: What is your take about this story? Should it have aired? And it is genuinely damaging to Peyton Manning?LOU HOLTZ, FMR. NOTRE DAME HEAD COACH: Well, with a name like Sly, that makes you very...LOWRY: I know. You can't make this stuff up, can you?HOLTZ: ... concerned (INAUDIBLE) But number two, I wonder how much money he was paid? Nobody gives 27 hours of their time. How much did they pay?I've known the Manning family. They've never been a bit of scandal in their entire life. They've lived their life. And Al Jazeera -- their main objective is to tear the country down. What greater way to do it than to try to tear down an icon like Peyton Manning?Let me say this also. Peyton Manning has never changed his appearance. I had the same neck surgery. For five months, I was in great pain. Doctor never recommended HGH to me.And if his wife took it, I don't blame her! We get (INAUDIBLE) anti-aging.  Good Lord, don't (ph) send it to me at my age, where my birthday's cost (ph) candles (ph) more than the cake.(LAUGHTER)HOLTZ: It's just natural for that to happen, particularly when you have a husband who's Peyton Manning. That's not unusual. But the thing that scares you about the people who make these accusations, they can vote and sometimes more than once.LOWRY: So Coach, just to put it in a nutshell, you think this is a deliberate smear of an American hero.HOLTZ: That's my personal opinion because give me the facts, give me the proof. You cannot prove a negative. Peyton Manning can't prove when did you stop beating your wife. If there's facts there, give it. The fact that you delivered a package to her, anti-aging to a woman? No, I don't think that's going to do it for me.Now, that's just my personal opinion. Give me the proof of what? How can you make an accusation against somebody who has done so much for so many people and for this country in general without any proof? And how much did they pay him?LOWRY: So Brian, should we care if human growth hormone was sent to his wife? And it was notable that Peyton Manning in his very fierce denunciation and denial of this report...KILMEADE: Right.LOWRY: ... didn't deny that his wife might have gotten these kind of...KILMEADE: Basically, if it's HGH and it says (ph) a packaged (ph) prescription -- they said there's only four reasons you get HGH, a legal prescription, is growth hormone deficiency in children, treats weakness in muscles from HIV. It says a chromosomal abnormality and Turner's syndrome and children born too small might be legally allowed to get HGH.I'm not sure what happens in the anti-aging community, but I would say this. And Coach, on top of that, it is not just about Peyton Manning. He did not come out and come just say about Peyton Manning. It's basically a number of Packers. Clay Matthews, former of USC, is also on the Packers.  He also names a bunch of baseball players along with it, and he just goes on and on and on.The difference about this is it's no Jose Canseco moment, where he says, Aha, Mark McGwire, you did this and all these other guys are cheating.  This is a guy who doesn't even want to be in the middle of it. And it happened in Vancouver, so he's not even subject to American laws or protections.HOLTZ: I wanted to say this. When you look at the thing from top to bottom, we've had so many athletes, whether it be Armstrong, Sammy Sosa, McGwire, deny it, and later we find out that they really lied to us. That is the problem here. But once again, show me the proof.LOWRY: Really quickly, we've got about a minute left. What is the state of the NFL and football these days? Bigger, better than ever?HOLTZ: I think it's bigger and better than ever. I think they're doing a better job of controlling the concussions. That's still a big concern. I think we have to do something to control the use of the helmet. To me, personally, take the face mask off the helmet and we'll have no more concussions.KILMEADE: A lot of broken noses.HOLTZ: The dentists will love it, but we'll get rid of the concussions.LOWRY: Who is going to win the college national championship this year?HOLTZ: I think it's going to come down to Oklahoma and Alabama, but once again, I've been wrong so many times, that's why I was in the third grade a little longer than normal.(LAUGHTER)LOWRY: All right, coach, thanks so much. Always a pleasure. Brian, thanks for being with us. Happy new year's guys.HOLTZ: Thank you.KILMEADE: Thank you.LOWRY: Coming up, a Muslim ACLU official says she emphatically refuses to condemn radical Islam. You won't believe her reason why.Plus Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is under fire after more violence rocked the windy city. Even reverend Al Sharpton is calling for him to step down.  Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)LOWRY: Welcome back to LOWRY. Yesterday Rana Elmir, the deputy director of the ACLU of Michigan wrote an op-ed in ""The Washington Post"" titled ""Stop Asking me to Condemn Terrorists Just Because I'm Muslim. I have no reason to say sorry, and Islamophobes won't believe me anyway."" At one point in her op-ed she writes ""I will not be bullied into condemning terror perpetrated by psychopaths who misrepresent and distort Islam for their deranged purposes.""Joining us now with reaction is the president of Act for America, Brigitte Gabriel, and the president of America Together Foundation Mike Ghouse.  Thanks so much for being here.Mike, let me start with you. I don't really get this point of view at all.  I was raised a Presbyterian. If there were major Presbyterian groups out there committing terrorism in the name of Presbyterianism, I would have no hesitation whatsoever to condemn them wholeheartedly and without any hesitation.MIKE GHOUSE, AMERICA TOGETHER FOUNDATION PRESIDENT: Rana should not only condemn terrorism, she should ask everyone, you, me, and every American to condemn terrorism, and that is the right thing to do, Rich.As a Muslim, I should -- I have triple responsibility. First, terrorism is wrong. Second, it's being labeled as Islamic, which it is not. Third, they're using the name of the religion that I am using, and that is wrong.  So I have a responsibility to condemn this to no end.Technically, however, she is right. Why should we accuse her, why should she apologize for an act she did not commit and she did not support. But there is a thing of freedom of speech, and she has that right, and we have the right to say what we want to say. But terrorism must be condemned by one and all. I don't know why she has to let it -- she should be condemned unequivocally. I condemn it, and Muslims in America and Muslims elsewhere condemn this act to no end.LOWRY: I'm totally with you on the point of the apology. No one should apologize for something they didn't do themselves or bear any responsibility for themselves.Brigitte, let me get you in on this. And this is an ongoing debate whenever there's a terror attack. I think it's so important to hear Muslims condemn Islamic terrorism because, unfortunately, Islamic extremism does have significant popular and theological support within the Islamic world. So it's important for other Muslims to make the case against this kind of extremism.BRIGITTE GABRIEL, ACT FOR AMERICA FOUNDER: It is extremely important for them to do that, to come strongly in condemnation of such barbarity in the name of their religion. We westerners need to see that in order to believe that the Muslim community really stands with us.And we are seeing across the western world, whether Australia or Canada or France, it is the Muslim minority that is causing problems regarding terrorism in relation to terrorism. And all these countries, this is not the Buddhist minority, it's not the Jewish minority, the Christian minority. It is the Islamic minority in every single western country across the world.So we are seeing a pattern. And it's very important for westerners to see the Muslim community within these nations come out strongly and condemn terrorism. We are not asking for them to apologize. There's a difference between apologizing for somebody and condemning their actions. The Islamic community must condemn the actions of what's being perpetrated in the name of Islam.GHOUSE: And we do.LOWRY: Mike, another important point here, and the reason why it's so important for us to applaud people for condemning this sort of terrorism is in a lot of the world, not necessarily in the United States or most of the west, but in the Middle East it actually takes courage, physical courage to stand up to these extremists when you're a Muslim. You are taking your life and your safety in your hands in some places when you do that.GHOUSE: That's very true. And I think most Muslims like most any other community, Christians, Americans, Pakistanis, are afraid to speak up because a few handful have bullied them into silence, and this is time for Muslims not to be bullied and speak out and condemn terrorism in unequivocal terms. And I think once more and more Muslims join we will decimate them, let them know that they do not have any support coming from any corner. And when they get that realization they'll start folding themselves in. And I think that's one way of dealing with terrorism, Rich.LOWRY: I love the energy. I love the energy and spirit. Brigitte, do you agree with the notion that ISIS is not Islamic?GABRIEL: ISIS is Islamic in its purist form. It's called the Islamic State. It operates following exactly the commandments of Muhammad. ISIS is not doing anything that Muhammad himself did not do, whether it is beheading, cutting off tongues, cutting off ears, killing traitors.  Muhammad himself was a military leader. In the Islamic world he is considered the perfect man. ISIS is following the Koran to the letter.GHOUSE: I have to disagree.LOWRY: We're running out of time. Disagree in 20 seconds.GHOUSE: Brigitte is completely wrong on that. She is wrong.GABRIEL: Not true. I am correct.GHOUSE: You are absolutely wrong on that.LOWRY: OK, we'll have to take up this debate later, but both of you, thanks so much for being here. Really appreciate it.Coming up next right here on LOWRY --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)AL SHARPTON: I think he's gone beyond the point where he can even govern with the trust of the people.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So you think he should step down?SHARPTON: I think that the people have to make that decision, but certainly from where I sit, he should.(END VIDEO CLIP)LOWRY: The reverend Al Sharpton is now calling for Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to resign. That and more as LOWRY continues.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)LOWRY: Welcome back to LOWRY. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has been coming under heavy criticism for how he has handled police shootings in the windy city. And now Reverend Al Sharpton is calling for him to resign. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SHARPTON: This is the height of either insensitivity, lack of intelligence, or arrogance, or a reasonable combination of all three. I don't see how he can continue governing now. I think he's gone beyond the point where he can even govern with the trust of the people.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So do you think he should step down?SHARPTON: Oh, I think that the people have to make that decision, but certainly from where I sit, he should.(END VIDEO CLIP)LOWRY: Joining me with reaction to this and the broader issue of urban crime, trial attorney and political commentator Eric Guster and fellow at the Manhattan Institute Heather MacDonald. Guys, thanks so much for being here. Eric, let me start with you. Now, the allegation with Rahm, at least one of them, is that the city withheld this damaging video of this controversial police shooting until after a really tightly fought election. Do you think it's time for Rahm Emanuel to resign?ERIC GUSTER, TRIAL ATTORNEY: It's probably time for him to resign. This is why. You have a leader of a city where there's clearly corruption, or clearly a misguided police force where they can hold a tape for over a year that no one knew existed. The police officer was not indicted. He was never charged until the tape was forcibly released. Then that is a problem. And it starts with the top. And that's why we need strong leaders in cities like Chicago and every other city to really make a stand.  LOWRY: Heather, I get why people are talking about Rahm Emanuel. He's a high profile figure in a very important city. But what I don't understand is why there's not more of a national conversation and a roiling debate about something you have been writing about very powerfully recently, which is big, double digit increases in the murder rate in major cities in America, Baltimore, St. Louis, Cincinnati. The roll call goes on and on.  And it seems for some reason the left wants to deny or make excuses for this jump in homicides.HEATHER MACDONALD, FELLOW AT MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: Absolutely. Chicago, shootings are up 17 percent this year. Homicides are up 16 percent.  That's the real scandal about Chicago is that the urban death violence rate for young kids is four times higher than that of New York City. And we want to talk about police instead of talking about crime. If the resignation of Emanuel would do anything to save more black lives, I would support it. But I have a simple rule of thumb. If Al Sharpton says something should happen, I'm generally on the opposite side of it.But I think that it's a lot easier to talk about politics than it is about healing the black family, getting fathers in the home again, to stop the bloodbath. On November 2nd a nine-year-old boy was lured into the alley of a Chicago Southside area and killed in cold blood in retaliation for his father's gang banging. That is the sort of thing the press should be focusing on.LOWRY: And nobody really hears about it.Eric, why don't we hear more about Baltimore now? Baltimore had an unprecedented, historic spike in the murder right where young black men are dying at an atrocious rate. It's as though those black lives don't matter.GUSTER: I can't say that. That's not correct.LOWRY: But the left doesn't seem to care about them.GUSTER: The left does care about them.LOWRY: Why don't we hear about it? Why isn't there a movement?GUSTER: There are plenty of movements. For example, I've talked about it on this show as well, my fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha is out doing great programs. We have to get back to jobs in the communities. When you have urban blacks, when you have people who don't have jobs, then those bad things are going to grow and fester. That's where we have to get back to putting jobs back into the inner cities, back into our economy in order to grow the economy and bring the educational system back up to par for those people to make it fair across the board where you don't have to be rich to get a great education.LOWRY: The economy hasn't gotten a worse manifestly over the last year.  It appears to be in Baltimore and other cities, police have pulled back because there is this movement that is criticizing them as systemic racists.MACDONALD: I would say with all respect to Eric has it backwards. You can't get jobs until crime is brought down. New York saw that. We brought crime down and the economy flourished in the inner city. The economy did not get better because of a government program. We've been spending trillions of dollars from the federal coffers alone on antipoverty programs. It wasn't until policing got data driven, held accountable police commanders for crimes in their jurisdictions that crime started dropping. But this effort to demonize the police is leading to police backing off, and people are dying as a result.LOWRY: Another thing that is very striking about these cities where we have these high profile cases and you have corrupt city officials, Chicago, Baltimore, they have been run, almost uniformly by Democrats for decades.  So doesn't the Democratic Party bear overwhelming responsibility for the state of these cities?GUSTER: First, let me reply to something she just mentioned. It is not about demonizing police. It is about showing what bad police do. And that is what the movement is about. It is about showing and improving what the bad police are doing and bringing light to that to get those bad apples out.When you have someone like Michael Scott, who was shot in the back, when you have people like other different cases where people have been literally executed by police, that is a problem. That is why people don't trust police. Just like in the Chicago case we just mentioned, this was not brought to light for over a year. And the city administration knew about this. This guy was shot over a dozen times, and he was not indicted. That is a problem.LOWRY: The point about Democrats running the cities that you're upset about?GUSTER: It's not just about Democratic Party and Republican Party. It's about quality leadership. And we have to get quality leaders in these positions.LOWRY: Right. But, I mean, these are Democratic cities and you haven't had quality leadership in decades.MACDONALD: And Rich, I would say it's whitewashing the Black Lives Matter movement to say that it's not demonizing the police across the board. The police are facing extraordinarily hostile, tense situations in their cities now. Every time they go to make an arrest they are cursed at, jeered out.  That is having a real effect on their morale and they're backing off.GUSTER: That's not true.LOWRY: We have got to leave it here.Coming up, more ""Lowry"" right after the break.
