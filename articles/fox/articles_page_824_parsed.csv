Jack Keane talks Trump Tower national security meeting; Trump supporter defends stance on potential Muslim registry 	"This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" November 17, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, FOX HOST: Breaking tonight, ""Fox News"" just confirming a critical new pick for President-elect Trump with the job offer going to a controversial candidate, one you know very well.Good evening and welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly.Topping a list of priorities for the president-elect, building the team that will protect this country at one of the most uncertain times in our history.Just moments ago, ""Fox News"" confirming that President-elect Trump has picked former Obama administration military intelligence chief lieutenant General Michael Flynn to be his national security adviser. This is a critical post in the national security landscape. It will not be without controversy. But it will be without Senate confirmation, which is not needed for that job.We're going to get into this in just one minute.Among the other candidates who visited Mr. Trump today, legendary foreign policy giant Henry Kissinger, South Carolina governor and reported candidate for secretary of state, possibly Nikki Hailey, head of the national security agency Admiral Mike Rogers and our next guest, retired four-star general and former vice chief-of-staff of the United States army, General Jack Keane, who says this country is facing global security challenges on a scale not seen since the rise of the Soviet Union. General Keane in a moment.But we begin tonight with chief national correspondent Ed Henry, who is here with me in New York on the breaking news and the transition. You just broke this. You just confirmed this. It's a deal.ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Lieutenant General Mike Flynn, who has been offered it. He has not officially accepted, but widely accepted that he will take this post.Why it is significant that he's being appointed to a top White House job as, as you say, he's made very controversial statements about Muslims before he's taken on President Obama, challenged him on national security. That's why he got forced out. And so Democrats would want a pound of flesh if he was nominated to a post like defense secretary or secretary of state. This allows President-elect Trump to get him installed right into the White House.Kellyanne Conway today pushed back on all these reports charging that more broadly the transition is moving too slow. She declared while they have a lot of work to do, they are moving methodically and calmly to focus on quality rather than speed.I mentioned Flynn. It is also another surprising move tonight, President- elect Donald Trump inviting Mitt Romney to a meeting this weekend at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. The same former Republican nominee that Trump called a choker and the same Romney who called Trump a phony and a fraud in that searing speech last March.Sources telling us tonight Romney is a potential secretary of state, a sign Trump maybe trying to bring together a team of rivals as we saw President Obama do with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Trump's friend Rudy Giuliani has been a contender for secretary of state as well after indications that he was not as interested in attorney general as outsiders expected. Other options include Senator Jeff Sessions for attorney general; the first lawmaker to stick his neck and endorse candidate Trump. As well as another surprising pick, a rival again for either attorney general or a spot on the Supreme Court, Ted Cruz who now sounds ready to join the team based on what he told ""Fox and Friends"" today. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I have an incredible job right now representing 27 million Texans and I'm incredibly honored to hold that job. And it's a job I take very, very seriously. I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact.(END VIDEO CLIP)HENRY: Now Senator Sessions also in the running to be defense secretary. You mentioned Henry Kissinger. General Keith Kellogg has also passed the Trump Tower. Lieutenant General Michael Flynn as well has been huddling with President-elect Trump.The bottom line is they want to get this national security team in place as quickly as possible, Megyn, because this is, as you said, critical, not just protecting the nation, but we're still at war and during a transition is when someone like ISIS is going to try to make some sort of a statement. You want to be on guard for that. And so while they are under great pressure to get this transition moving, national security top of the list.KELLY: Absolutely. Ed, good to see you.HENRY: Good to see you.KELLY: Adding to the urgency for Mr. Trump to assemble his national security team, today the director of national intelligence James Clapper submitted his letter of resignation. He will stay on, however, until President Obama leaves office in January, putting Mr. Trump in the position to choose his successor.Joining us now, General Jack Keane, who is a retired four-star general, former vice chief-of-staff for the U.S. Army and chairman of the board for the Institute of the Study of War.As we mentioned, he also visited Trump Tower today and there's some vacancies there, general. So, come on, let's have it. What did you get offered?GEN. JACK KEANE, RETIRED FOUR-STAR GENERAL: Look, it was his meeting, all right, not mine and he controls the information. But I'll tell you this. The thing I have in common with Donald Trump is about a dozen years ago, we got a ""Man of the Year"" award in New York City, the Hotel Plaza from the USO. So I met him once and I found him to be very personable. He asked excellent questions, you know, throughout the 45 minutes that I was with him. Very, very engaged and very curious about, you know, the world and its complexity. You know, something, let's be honest, that he and many of his close in advisers that he's selected don't have a lot of knowledge about.Most people who aspire to be president don't have a foreign policy and national security background. The exception was certainly Hillary Clinton.KELLY: But you do. You do, so I mean, you tell me, because you are enjoying your retirement and all your many stars. And now, you know, you're working in the Institute of the Study of War, which you co-founded - - you founded.So you tell me whether you might have some interest in being the director of national intelligence or even secretary of defense or something like that.KEANE: Well, that's between myself and Donald Trump. I feel --(CROSSTALK)KELLY: That's not a no.KEANE: I spoke very frankly to him and he understands where I'm coming from.KELLY: All right, viewers, we are getting some place with the general. We're getting some place. I feel like we know, but he just can't say.I want to ask you about the breaking news and Michael Flynn -- Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. We know him. He's on ""The Kelly File"" all the time.Many people are going to lose their minds over this. Just explain why this position is so important, national security adviser to the president.KEANE: Yes, it's a real important position certainly. Just the name itself implies that. There's two jobs there. The one is the one -- the one is very visible, the national security adviser to the president. And, obviously, the president judges whether that person is successful or not because he or she speaks to that person on a regular basis, just about every single day, multiple times a day.KELLY: That person is like the clearinghouse for information from the intelligence agencies and who else?KEANE: From all of the inter-agencies that deal with national security. So the second piece of the position, it gives you a better sense of it, he's also the director of the national security council which has members on it from the Department of Defense, Department of State, all of our intelligence agencies, the Department of Treasury, et cetera. And it has its own staff, which now is about 400. Senate Arms Service Committee wants to reduce it. so those are the two jobs.KELLY: So he doesn't need to be confirmed in that position. He can just, you know, if Donald Trump wants him, he's got him. But people are already pointing to some controversial statements that General Flynn has said in the past, including let me pull it up this one from his Twitter account. This is from April, last April. ""Fear of Muslims is rational,"" in all capital letters, RATIONAL. ""Please forward this to others. The truth fears no questions.""I mean, his language like that and as General Flynn's somewhat controversial history especially with the Democrats going to hurt him at all. I mean, can it?KEANE: Well, as I said before, he's advising the president of the United States. That's between the two of them. The president is going to judge whether Flynn is doing a good job or not. The other thing he does so I can just carry that thought a little further, he could -- when a president makes a decision to implement a national security policy, it will be General Flynn's job to coordinate all of the agencies I mentioned in the execution of that policy. And also --(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Do you feel good about it? Do you feel like General Flynn can do this?KEANE: I know him. He's a good guy. You know, this is about the president's confidence in somebody that he knows, somebody he likes and somebody he trusts. That's what this is really all about.KELLY: We got our eyes on you, General Jack.KEANE: I frankly don't think whether we think he's a good guy or not, or a great guy or a bad guy, it's not even relevant. This is about the president picking a guy he wants to talk to every single day about national security. That's what's important.KELLY: I'm just telling you, we're watching you. I'm going to see you going back in the Trump Tower. We're going to see a big announcement. I hope you come right here to ""Kelly File"" first after you get it. Great to see you.KEANE: Good talking to you, Megyn.KELLY: Also with us tonight, Katrina Pierson, who is the former Trump campaign national spokesperson and Matt Bennett, who is co-founder of the ""Third Way"" and a former deputy assistant to President Bill Clinton.Great to see you both.So let me just start with you on this, Katrina. It's now being confirmed. Our Ed Henry has confirmed General Michael Flynn and he is already taking the incoming on this.What say you to the people who say he sat in on intelligence briefings while he was advising foreign clients, he made the controversial tweet about how fear of Muslims is rational, not radical Muslims, but just Muslims. Your thoughts?KATRINA PIERSON, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: Well, I won't confirm or deny the appointment simply until the transition team does.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: We already know.PIERSON: I don't want to make that mistake.KELLY: OK.PIERSON: Simply because we've heard rumors and people for the last two days. And, you know, the media can't decide, Megyn, on how to shift gears from trying to defeat Trump to trying to actually cover him by holding him to a completely non-existent standard.And, you know, it's really bad when David Axelrod, chief strategist to Barack Obama, took to Twitter today to remind the media that they didn't even have these appointments made at this time without criticism.KELLY: No one here is criticizing him for not making appointments fast enough. I'm talking about General Flynn and whether he's good for this position.I'll give it to you, Matt, on why the Democrats don't seem to like himMATT BENNETT, CO-FOUNDER, THIRD WAY: He is a horrendous choice for this job. General Keane is being polite. But being the national security adviser is incredibly important.Think about it. Condi Rice was the national security adviser in 9/11. You have to coordinate all of the agencies as the general is discussing. You have to make sure that the president's wishes are carried out by the entire national security establishment, which is gigantic and most importantly you have to be an honest broker for the incoming that you're getting from the State Department and CIA and the intelligence agencies and the defense department.He is, by all accounts, a very difficult guy to work for. But, also, and much more, importantly, he's just not a good person. He's talking about how we should fear all Muslims. That is not the kind of person that you need in the most important position in Washington.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Well, just because he made that one statement, which I've had him on the show many times and I have heard him speak about radical Muslims for the most part, although this tweet doesn't say that, just for the record. So I don't know that you can lead to he's not a good person, Matt.PIERSON: Can I --KELLY: Good ahead, Katrina.PIERSON: But if we're being honest here, I mean, whoever Mr. Trump nominates to any position, there's going to be scrutiny. There's been scrutiny over his initial appointments.KELLY: Of course.PIERSON: And so I think to expect that that this is just going to be, you know, icing on the cake is just completely unfounded.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: OK, but the criticism, Katrina, is that the people who are going in there, that they don't have any experience and that it's just favors he is returning. He's putting, you know, people in major positions as just favors because they were loyal to him as opposed to people, this is the criticism, who know what they're doing.PIERSON: Right. And the election is over and the people chose Donald Trump. Someone who had never been a politician before because they trust him to make the right decisions and to choose the right people. And, again, this is not just one person that's going to be making these decisions. There are teams that are going to be put in place. The landing teams are going to be announced soon. Mr. Trump is brilliant when it comes to putting together teams and when it comes to doing what he wants to get done. And I think he's proven that time and time again.KELLY: Go ahead, Matt.BENNETT: Well, look, he's made three appointments, one of them I think most Democrats are comfortable with, which is his chief-of-staff Reince Priebus. But the other ones, Steve Bannon as you well know , Megyn, is unbelievably controversial because he again is somebody who is just so far outside the mainstream.If George W. Bush had had a meeting in the Oval Office with Steve Bannon, it would have been news because it would have been a scandal. Now he's going to have an office next to the Oval Office and I think there is going to be same kind of questions raised about General Michael Flynn.KELLY: But, you know, as Katrina pointed out, Steve Bannon was running Trump's campaign and the people elected him, Matt, so you know --BENNETT: No doubt.KELLY: Is there really any objection to Trump using him as he wants, President-elect Trump?BENNETT: No. We can't -- we can't stop it. He can appoint who he wants and he will, but we can object to it because this is not the kind of guy that you want in the halls of power. You want somebody much more reasonable and much more mainstream than guys like Steve Bannon.KELLY: I think your objection may be overruled.PIERSON: There's a laundry list of controversial people surrounding Barack Obama as well.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Good to see you. I got to go. I got to go. Great to see you both.Also breaking tonight, new reports that Nancy Pelosi could be caught in the crossfire as the Democrats get ready to punish someone for the epic losses last week. Will it be Ms. Pelosi.Plus, a fierce fight breaking out today over the idea of tracking immigrants who come here from terror hot beds. We'll show you what the law says about this, and then we'll pick up the political fight with Hassan Shibly from The Council on American Islamic Relations and former Navy S.E.A.L. Carl Higbie. They are next. Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, growing fallout over reports that the president- elect's team may be considering some kind of registry for folks who are coming to the United States from areas that are hot beds for terrorism.While critics are hitting the plan as anti-American, some constitutional experts say it's not only legal, but several administrations have used practices this.Trace Gallagher explains how this might work.Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, when it comes to implementing Donald Trump's call for extreme vetting of immigrants from some Muslim countries, Kansas secretary of state Chris Kobach, a member of the Trump transition team says the answer might be reinstating the National Security Exit and Entry Program System known as NSEERS, which required people from primarily Muslim countries deemed as a higher risk to be interrogated and fingerprinted.The program started after 9/11 and ended in 2011 when the Department of Homeland Security decided it was redundant. It was also criticized for unfairly targeting Muslims.And Chris Kobach who helped design the program acknowledges NSEERS didn't result in any terror charges, but says it was a great tool for fighting terror because law enforcement could identify potential terrorists who did register and arrest those who didn't. And even those who oppose NSEERS say it would be easy to reinstate because technically it's still on the books.Former policy director for Homeland Security Theresa Brown told BuzzFeed, the program is inactive because the 25 high risk countries were taken off the list. But if the president issues a new order and if the homeland security secretary issues a new list of countries, the program could be easily reactivated.Whether it passes constitutional muster is a different question. Experts say there is no comparison to the interment of the Japanese during World War II because those were American citizens. And now the Trump team says they would not be registering just Muslims, but rather those who come primarily from Muslim countries, a distinct legal distinction.KELLY: OK. Trace, thank you.Our next guest is among the legal experts suggesting that a program like this, like that post-9/11 registry would likely pass constitutional muster before a judge in part because it already has.J. Christian Adams is a former DOJ attorney.Great to see you, Chris.J. CHRISTIAN ADAMS, FORMER DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ATTORNEY: Hey, Megyn.KELLY: So describe what exactly you think would be legal.ADAMS: Foreigners do not have a constitutional right to enter the United States, Megyn. Even Americans, they don't enjoy the Fourth Amendment rights against search and seizure when they are at the border. So the Constitution doesn't apply normally at the border.All you have to do is say these hot beds of terror have to be subject to additional screening. This is a reasonable request. It's something I think most Americans would agree with.If you come to this country and want in from these hot beds of terrorism, you're going to be subjected to additional screening. It's neither Muslim nor a registry. It's where the terror is.KELLY: How far could they go with that? I mean, could they say, we need your address, we need your cell phone, we need your fingerprints, you need to check in with us every three days and if you don't, you're out?ADAMS: Absolutely. It's totally constitutional. And it was in play, something similar to that up until 2011, which naturally the Obama administration quit doing. You could say you have to check in INS every week.Remember, the 9/11 terrorist, Megyn, overstayed their visa. A tool like this would have been effective to help stop 9/11.KELLY: So how -- I mean, the concern is that what if we wanted to go beyond that? What if we wanted to do something like corral them and keep them in a certain area? I mean, they do have constitutional rights once they get on U.S. soil and get past the border.ADAMS: That's right. And nobody is suggesting that. Nobody is suggesting -- that's part of this attack on the Trump transition is they're making things up that aren't actually being suggested.You cannot corral people based on their religion and nobody is suggesting it. But you can impose entry requirements that will protect this country by asking them about their views of certain issues. Or do they think it's legitimate to wage jihad against the west.KELLY: Can Donald Trump just do that with a stroke of a pen or does he have to, you know, get that pass through a Congress.ADAMS: He can do it with a stroke of a pen and I suggest he probably is going to do it, because that's why he was elected, to try to keep America safer than we've seen over the last couple of years. In places like Paris, where you can see what happens if you don't protect the country.KELLY: The president has a lot of power in dealing with the border to protect the nation.Christian Adams, great to see you.ADAMS: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: Well, this debate over this has been on fire in the media today and we're picking it up there with Carl Higbie, a former Navy SEAL and Trump supporter and Hassan Shibly, the chief executive director of the Florida branch on The Council of American Islamic Relations known as C.A.I.R.Great to see you both.So, Carl, you -- we had this debate on the show last night.CARL HIGBIE, FORMER NAVY SEAL: Right.KELLY: You just want to make clear that -- we got into this back and forth about, you know, whether there was legal precedent for doing this.HIGBIE: Right.KELLY: Checking at the border. And you were not -- you made a reference to the Japanese in World War II and your position tonight is that that was not a reference to internment camps, is that right?HIGBIE: Oh no, absolutely. I was quite frankly -- I was actually shocked that you brought in internment camps. But it was a reference strictly to the scrutiny on immigration and the stopping of immigration and the registration of immigrants coming from places like Japan and Italy and Germany and things like that. So, no, it had nothing to do with interment camps whatsoever.KELLY: OK. You didn't say that you were shocked. Here is what happened between us last night when we were talking about this proposal by Chris Kobach to check out Muslims at the border. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: You're discussing drafting a proposal to reinstate a registry for immigrants from Muslim countries, for immigrants from Muslim countries.HIGBIE: Yes. And perfectly honest, it is legal. They say the whole constitution a muster. I know the ACLU is going to challenge it, but I think it will pass. And we've done it with Iran back a while ago. We did it during World War II with Japanese, which, you know, call what you will - -KELLY: Come on, you're not proposing we go back to the days of interment camps I hope.HIGBIE: No, no, I'm not proposing that at all, Megyn. But what I am saying is that --(CROSSTALK)KELLY: You know better than to suggest that. I mean, that's the kind of stuff that gets people scared, Carl.HIGBIE: Right. I'm just saying there is precedent for it. And I'm not saying I agree with it.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: So I mean there wasn't shock expressed there. You were saying there's precedent for it, which is what got people, you know, confused, but I take you at your word if you're saying you were referencing something else. You were trying to make a different point.HIGBIE: Yes. It was references in parallel with Iran when we, you know, under Jimmy Carter, when we banned immigration from Iran. So I assume that -- forgive me for not being as clear as I possibly could.KELLY: Because you mentioned the Japanese and World War II.HIGBIE: Yes, no, I did, but I did not ever mention internment camps. So, you know, for those out there who thought it was --KELLY: I know, but that's kind of the big story about what we did here with the Japanese.HIGBIE: You put words out there, Megyn, and let's be honest the media has --KELLY: Only after you put out the words about what we did to the Japanese in World War II, which is like, OK, I remember that.HIGBIE: Yes, well, I tell you what, you know what, I think the left-wing media took this by the horns because they're not a fan of Donald Trump. It is exactly why he ran because of the dishonest media. I'm not saying you.KELLY: OK. Listen, I understand you're clarifying it. Got it.Hassan, let me bring you in on what Carl is actually saying tonight, which is he supports this proposal. You just heard our lawyers saying it would be upheld in a court of law to say Muslims coming into the country from countries where terror originates, or where there's a terror problem that they could be forced to submit to this kind of monitoring.Your thoughts?HASSAN SHIBLY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CAIR: Thank you, Megyn. And to Carl I say have you no sense of decency, sir? I mean, America is a country based on freedom of religion. Freedom of religion is a fundamental principle that I have taken an oath and I'm sure you've taken oath to protect. And it is ineffective to target people simply based on religion.Let's target criminals, let's target terrorist but let's not divide people simply based on their religion. And my children hear you. After Donald Trump won, my children came home, their ages 4, 5 and 6, and we don't talk about politics at home, but they said, daddy, daddy, Trump won and now he's going to kick us out and he's going to build a wall so big we can't even fly back home. And I told my kids, don't worry, you were all born here, this is your land and I'll protect your freedom to practice your faith in this land as we will protect the freedom of all Americans to practice their faiths in this land and their freedom.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Well, he's not talking about Americans, though, Hassan. He's not talking about Americans. He's talking about foreigners, who want to come in to America and the kind of screening that we should do when we're in a war on terror.SHIBLY: Well, I think anybody coming into America should face scrutiny and screening to make sure that people who are coming into America are --(CROSSTALK)KELLY: You don't think there should be any heightened scrutiny for those who come from hot beds of terror.SHIBLY: I don't think there should be heightened scrutiny based on people's religion. Again, that's not what America is about. You have IRA committing terrorism --(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Is that based on religion or is it based on geographical -- you know, geopolitical war.SHIBLY: Well, we've heard many different things. We've heard many different things from Trump supporters and Trump surrogates and some have advocated -- I mean, this gentleman here himself has said some very negative things about the entire Muslim community.We can't be promoting fear and hate against an entire religious community. Let's target on actual threats, but let's not divide Americans based on religion because what makes America so great is freedom of religion. That's what the U.S. Constitution is about.KELLY: Go ahead, Carl.HIGBIE: Well, Hassan, forgive me for not taking you too seriously about American security and safety, which is the paramount of Donald Trump's policies here.Your organization CAIR was listed as a terror organization by the UAE. Seven of your board members can't come into the United States because they have alleged terrorist ties. And you supported Hamas.So let's be very clear here. Donald Trump wants to protect Americans first and scrutinize people who want to join our country. And make sure when they do join our country, they do it on our terms which is safe for Americans but we also want to be fair to the people who are already here.So I welcome immigrants, I welcome people from all over the country or all over the world to join us here. But I want to make sure that it's safe for Americans in my country that I fought for.KELLY: Go ahead, Hassan.SHIBLY: And that's absolutely false. You know, I'm a civil rights lawyer. I run the largest civil rights organization in the state of Florida. We defend the rights of all people of discrimination regardless of race, or religion or ethnicity --(CROSSTALK)KELLY: The UAE has designated CAIR as a terrorist organization.SHIBLY: The UAE, the UAE did designate CAIR, not CAIR of Florida and we don't go by the UAE. We live in a democratic country. The UAE does not have a democratic freedoms or liberties and the reason they did this is because.HIGBIE: There is another Muslim county --SHIBLY: .here is a civil rights organization -- yes, a dictatorship. Are you under UAE laws? Or do we believe in American laws? I go by the American system.Only a couple of months ago, I met with the president. Our deputy director is a sheriff deputy and he protects this country day and night. We keep our country safe. We are proud Americans and we want to keep America a free and just nation for all people regardless of their race or religion. And we will stand for all victims of discrimination. Let's stand united. Let's not let fear and hate divide us and turn us against each other. We stand united. Thank you.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Carl, I'll give you the quick last word and I got to go.HIGBIE: I just want to say thank you, Megyn. I think the American people understand where we stand on our differences on this one. So thank you.KELLY: Great to see you both.Also tonight, we're doing a new investigation into fake news reports and whether they change people's votes.Plus, Nancy Pelosi may lose her 14-year grip on power as a result of the pounding the Democrats took last week. Marc Thiessen and Austin Goolsbee are here on what that means for the country.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Well, let me just say that as I said without even asking anybody for a vote, I have over two-thirds of the caucus supporting me.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, a young Democrat from the Blue Collar Town of Youngstown, Ohio has stepped up to challenge Nancy Pelosi and possibly break her 14-year grip on power. That news comes as President Obama faces roughly two months in office left and the legacy under possibly going under from the President-elect.The Clintons appear to be leaving the political stage meantime after being a powerful force in Washington for over 30 years. Senator Harry Reid is retiring after three decades in office. Nancy Pelosi could do nothing but watch as her caucus decided this week to delay leadership elections while they figure out what went wrong on Election Day. Joining me right now, Fox News Contributor Former Chief Speech Writer to President George W. Bush Marc Thiessen and President Obama's Former Chief Economist and Economic Professor at Chicago's Booth Schools of Business, Austan Goolsbee, great to see you both.MARC THIESSEN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISING SCHOLAR AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to see you, Megyn.AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIST AND ECONOMIC PROFESSOR AT CHICAGO'S BOOTH SCHOOLS OF BUSINESS: Thanks for having us back.KELLY: So Marc, let's put this in perspective for us about the state of the Democrats and the Democratic Party right now.THIESSEN: Well, the Democrats have called off their elections until they can figure out what the hell is going on. That's what it sounds like right now. Look, the state of the Democratic Party is pretty bad. A few weeks ago the Democrats were preparing to measure the drapes in the White House. And once the Republican Party infight over how they had this devastating lost to Hillary Clinton. Now it's the Republicans that are measuring the drapes and the Democrats are infighting.And they have a lot to fight about. As Congressman Ryan has correctly pointed out, they've had the smallest congressional minority since 1929. Donald Trump has been elected president of the United States. They've lost 60 seats in Congress since 2010 and that is at the Republican wave at the national level. At the state level, the Democrat Party has lost 242 state legislative seats, since Barack Obama took office, lost control of 30 state legislative chambers and a dozen governorships.When Barack Obama took office Democrats - I am sorry. Republicans had control of about eight state legislatures where they had the governor and the state legislature. Today it's half the country. And Democrats controls it. So the Democratic Party has been -- we have been focusing on the national election at the state level they've been completely wiped out. The wave is in the national level, there is a tsunami at the state level.KELLY: Pretty compelling argument there, Austan. What's the counter?GOOLSBEE: Yeah, look, several of those things I don't disagree with. You know, Donald Trump wins a very narrow presidential victory. But I think Marc is right, that completely turned the tables. Now it's the Democrats fighting with each other trying to figure out, you know, why did this happen and whose fault was it and where should they move.The only thing I would observe at the state level is a lot of what you've seen at the state level is true at the House of Representatives too, which was 2010 was a big year for Republicans and because 2010 is a census year, you had a massive amount of redistricting in those states. And that has absolutely redounded into the House of Representatives and into the State Legislatures. You've seen the senate remain much more balanced because there's no redistricting.KELLY: What do you make, I mean, obviously the Democratic Party has some soul searching to do. You tell me, they don't seem like they fully understand why or how they lost.GOOLSBEE: That is partly true.KELLY: From the diagnosis, I guess the postmortem I'm looking for.GOOLSBEE: Look, we can both parties we have seen can overreact to very narrow election victories by the other side. You've seen that happen multiple times over the last 20 years.KELLY: You think Nancy Pelosi is going to get the boot?GOOLSBEE: Well, see that is what I was going to say. That said, it's clear with the Clintons, with Pelosi, we got a generation of leadership that sometime in the near future is going to shift to the next generation. I don't know if it's right now. Nancy Pelosi is pretty strong and pretty effective. I don't know if this one congressman from Ohio will be the challenge. But I do think, you know, the winds are blowing, the winds of change are definitely blowing.KELLY: Wind of change, yeah. Marc, basically the Republicans took over the Congress in 2010, Austan is saying and re-jiggered the lines such as, you know, in a way to help the Republicans.THIESSEN: Yeah. If it were that easy then they wouldn't have any problems. Then they would have to wait for the redistricting. Look, the reality is I hope they keep Nancy Pelosi in power, because if you have the same leadership, you have the same results. The reality is that reason that the Democrats have been wiped out is because they've lost the white working class vote in states like Ohio, state like Pennsylvania, state like Wisconsin.KELLY: Why is that?THIESSEN: Because they lost, personal - because they have utter contempt for those people. These are people that Barack Obama said are bitter people who clean the guns, that Hillary Clinton called them the deplorables. They are not going to win those people back with the San Francisco liberals. Tim Ryan is from Youngstown, from that part of the world, he knows how to bring the Democrat Party back, but I hope they don't listen to him.KELLY: Quickly, Austan, go ahead.GOOLSBEE: Marc is kind a firing the most inflammatory things that he can fire. I mean Barack Obama's popularity rating is following Ronald Reagan's at this point of presidency. And Donald Trump just lost the popular vote by more than a million.KELLY: But he won the Electoral College.(CROSSTALK)Let that be your warm blanket as you go to sleep, to President Trump.(LAUGHTER)Great to see you both, nine days after Donald Trump's victory and some of Hollywood's ardent liberals are still having trouble coming to terms with the results. We'll show you what actress Lena Dunham is now doing in her struggle to cope with the results.Plus, have you heard about fake news? Did you hear about this on Facebook? Did it really change how people voted? Our investigation is next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, FORMER UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT: There's so much active misinformation and it's packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)From the world's headquarters of Fox News, it's ""The Kelly File"" with Megyn Kelly.KELLY: Developing tonight, a brand-new analysis from Buzz Feed News has found that in the months leading up to the U.S. Election, bogus election news stories generated more engagement on Facebook than top real stories. Now some of the left are claiming that fake news contributed to the outcome of the race and President Obama is warning about living in an age of misinformation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: There's so much active misinformation and it's packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television. If everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won't know what to protect.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining us now, Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News Digital Politics Editor and Dana Loesch, host of The Blaze on TV and Author of ""Hands Off my Gun: Defeating the Plot to Disarmed America"", great to see you both.DANA LOESCH, THE BLAZE ON TV AND AUTHOR OF ""HANDS OFF MY GUN: Thanks for having us.Fake news, it's apparently a real thing though I don't know if it was a real cause of Hillary's defeat. Let's just start with -- apparently the fake stories, the biggest ones include that Mrs. Clinton sold weapon to ISIS, that the Pope endorsed Donald Trump, that Ireland was accepting American refugees fleeing Donald Trump and that RuPaul, the drag queen, you know, right, said he was groped by Trump.LOESCH: Well, that was a foul story.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DECISION DESK CORRESPONDENT: Whoa.LOESCH: That probably moved a lot of needles.STIREWALT: Don't say that.(LAUGHTER)LOESCH: There was a story where - no, seriously. There was some story where it was, it was Media Research Center and they discovered that about 8 percent of voters, they determined that maybe if what they had believed was being said about Hillary Clinton that they saw on the news, maybe if they would have believed it. It would have had an impact on the way they voted. But nobody trusted the media, 70 percent of voters don't trust the media. That is a MRC poll from last week, so, I don't really think -- and those are so outlandish, the RuPaul. That is my favorite. I haven't heard that one until tonight.KELLY: Stirewalt, you know, fake news I guess could be potentially a problem.STIREWALT: Yeah.KELLY: What seemed to be the bigger issue in this election was real news that was completely ignored by a lot of people, for one reason or another, on both sides?STIREWALT: Well, look, the attack, the sustained attack on the press, so we earned it in large part. The broken faith with the American people by dishonest reporting heavily biased reporting passing itself off as objective journalism, decades of mistakes brought.KELLY: Some of which was revealed in WikiLeaks.STIREWALT: Some are revealed from WikiLeaks, not just revealed by turning on the television for some channels and going oh, I see how it is. So, all of these decades of misconduct laid open the door in 2016 that you had both campaigns, particularly Donald Trump waging war against the press. Hillary Clinton said it's because of the coverage of my e-mails that I'm in trouble. Actually it's because of the emails that you're in trouble. And then Donald Trump of course with an all-out attack on the press. CNN sucks, CNN sucks.KELLY: Disgusting was his favorite.STIREWALT: Rage and hate against the press. He ran against the press and Clinton did to a degree too.LOESCH: He skull-stumped the press. I mean, there is really no other way to put it. I mean, there's really no other way to put it, but that is exactly what happened. But the thing is he did to the American media what so many voters have wanted to see happen for the longest time. Think about this. Back in 2010, even before that, back in 2008, if you didn't vote for Barack Obama, then maybe you have some racist tendency that is how it started. And this in 2010, right before the healthcare, unaffordable healthcare I prospect, there was a whole story of congressional members that were spit on by tea Party demonstrators in Washington, D.C.There was zero proof of this. It was a made up story. Nothing was confirmed. And it kept going, going and going and the stories got more, more, and more outrageous. This wasn't a left meaning website or it wasn't a right leaning website doing this. This was major network news that was doing this. I remember there were reports of tea Party activists that were carrying firearms, but they were cropping people out, so you couldn't tell that it was a black American voter who was carrying a firearm lawfully. I mean that is the kind of stuff they did so people would freak out.KELLY: It's almost like you want a do-over. Let's start with media over again. It's gotten so clammed up with bad information and bad actors. You know in some cases, in the eyes of the viewers in particular.STIREWALT: Social media is great, because it connects people in ways that they haven't been before. The success of Donald Trump is reflection, not just of his ability to share information or misinformation, but it is a reflective of the ability to create a network and an organization of people that transcend normal networks. Great, that is really good. But there is something that we have to pay attention to which is if we can't be sure we're telling the people the truth, and they are un-trusted sources, we won't keep the Republic.KELLY: I would say, no matter, you know we have taken a lot of bumps and bruises, we the press, many of them been deserved.LOESCH: Some of them better than others.KELLY: It's still a noble profession.STIREWALT: We got a job to do.KELLY: We're looking out for them. We're trying. There are a lot of great journalists who give up a lot and who work very hard, usually for very little money, giving you the best information they can, great to see you both.LOESCH: Thank you, Megyn.STIREWALT: Yeah.KELLY: So, Lena Dunham, Tom Hanks and Brian Kilmeade. Only one of them is here, next.(LAUGHTER)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Two winners in the 2016 election, Donald Trump and the therapists working in and around the Hollywood area. It seems some of the best known names from the entertainment industry are having, especially hard time with the results. Here to discuss it, is the Co-Host of ""Fox & Friends"", Brian Kilmeade and, listen to this, if you're in Dayton, Ohio tomorrow night, you can catch Brian at a signing for his book, ""Thomas Jefferson and the Triple E Pirates"", 4:30 p.m. Eastern at Book and Co. Dayton, Ohio. Kilmeade will be there, exciting.BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX AND FRIENDS SHOW HOST: And I will not be crying. Lena Dunham, evidently the story goes. She is at the Javits Center, waiting for Hillary Clinton to show up, so she could have a party of a lifetime. Then she would realizes Florida stone the other door action, she reaches to her face to find tears there. He was crying. A little bit later she found hives on her chin, she found somebody else, and who also have hives in her chin. It was clear Hillary Clinton is going to lose. The only thing she could do is join her boyfriend at home and take a shower. And she did.KELLY: You know what, can I tell you for the record one of our producers, Emily Jeffers she also breaks out in hives when she gets upset.KILMEADE: Really?KELLY: Not in this particular instant. But I think it could happen. That could happen.KILMEADE: Is she upset now? Please bring her out.KELLY: I think she is feeling pretty good.KILMEADE: All right. Ok, good. I've never had that kind of reaction. Sometimes if I scratch a dirty cat, my eyes will puff up.KELLY: Well, you know, the truth is, this is very upsetting to a lot of Americans the same way as, you know when Barack Obama won two times in a row. It was very upsetting to someone on the other side.KILMEADE: But in which famous people get upset, they do interesting things that blue collar people can't do.KELLY: Like what?KILMEADE: They go to Aspen, Colorado, where they just go and climb rocks.KELLY: Is that where Lena Dunham is?KILMEADE: That is exactly what she did.KELLY: In Aspen, I thought she was in Arizona, the same thing.(LAUGHTER)KILMEADE: Same thing. She is in Arizona. Don't look for her. She is out now and she decides.KELLY: Just don't look for her.KILMEADE: Right. Don't look for her, but she is back she says she realized she is going to fight the good fight.KELLY: How about Tom Hanks. He is taking a different route.KILMEADE: Typical classy Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks got another award on Wednesday, so finally he is getting recognized.(LAUGHTER)So he gets the trophy, because there's nothing in the trophy case. I am so embarrassed for. He was really good at ""Growing Pains?"" (Inaudible) he was fantastic, by the way.KELLY: Would you get to the point.KILMEADE: All right. He is making a speech, that was Tom says, listen, I was form to somebody else but the paraphrase, he says it is time for as Americans, we are not Republican or Democrat, we are Americans. And my hope is that Donald Trump does so well I vote for his reelection in four years and that is the attitude that most people have. When Barack Obama won and Mitt Romney lost, you're an American. Same thing with George Bush and Al gore, you are an American.KELLY: Although I have to say I will never get over the fact when Barack Obama was elected and inaugurated in 2008 and I went to his inauguration in 2009, there were people in that crowd who booed George W. Bush and Laura Bush and George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush. How do you boo Barbara Bush, explained that to me, I don't understand.So, healing is good. You helped produce a healing moment as well that people don't know. It's in my book, ""Settle for more"" which you can buy right now, it is on stand and it helped Donald Trump and I get over the weirdness that went on between us. And people don't know that Brian is like, Henry Kissinger, I reached out to Donald Trump to meet with me, like sit down with me so we could stop that and he didn't want to see me. And then enter Brian Kissinger, tell them what happened. It is in the book.KILMEADE: He disrupted me because he made up with Mitt Romney too today, the same type thing, as bad as he gets, fundamentally he does want to get over things. My sense is I went to interview him and we got in a fight earlier that day, because of you. Because he is going to have to - to make the long story short, I had a chance to talk to him, that was the time I said listen, if I talk to Megyn and Megyn wants to talk to you, can we get this thing done. You want it to get it done, and so he said go ahead. Call - text my office. Hope they bring me back, sure enough, let's do it Sunday, can't do it on Sunday. Can Melania come, can't come. Next thing you know he met you and now you're friends. It is very similar to the same pattern with Mitt Romney and Ted Cruz.KELLY: It was amazing. You did a great job and you really helped us both out, great to see you. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Are you a working parents struggling with the joys of doing and having it all. Check out ""Settle for more"" at your local bookstore and we can share some stories. Thanks for watching, everybody. I'm Megyn Kelly.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, 'ON THE RECORD' HOST: Welcome On The Record. I'm Greta Van Susteren. I'm joined tonight by Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and my colleague, Bret Baier.BRET BAIER, 'SPECIAL REPORT' HOST: I'm here with Madam Secretary. I will take the next seven minutes followed by Greta. Two quick follow-ups on Benghazi now and then we move to something else. You talked about the war. September 12th, Beth Jones, the Acting Assistant Secretary of State sends an mail to your Chief of Staff and others staying she has been speaking with the Libyans, specifically the Libyan ambassador. And she writes, quote, when he said quote that he expected that his regime elements carried out the attacks, I told the group that conducted the attacks Ansar al-Sharia is affiliated with Islamic extremists. So, the question is why is the state department telling the Libyans, the Libyan ambassador, Ansar al-Sharia, and yet telling the American people at the same time it was this video?HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: Well, Bret, I think that you have to take both ideas at the same time. I don't know anybody who is saying it is only the video now, but I think at the time , there was a lot of information flowing around that we were trying to assess that at least it played a part. We knew it had in Cairo which is next door to Libya. But, also, we were trying to sort things out like who did what, when, and information kept changing. I mean, that is you know one of the challenges, why I write about hard choices because information is coming at you from all directions. It sometimes takes time to sort it out, find out what actually is accurate, and frankly, what's not.BAIER: I heard your interview with Diane Sawyer. What exactly are you taking responsibility for?CLINTON: I took responsibility for being at the head of the state department at that time. Now, that doesn't mean that I made every decision because I obviously did not. But it does mean that I feel very deeply and very personally about the losses that we incurred. And there were others who were lost in the line of duty while I was as secretary. And it also means that as a leader, I have a responsibility to try to figure out what happened and then to put into place changes that will prevent anything like that from happening again. And, the United States government, just like any business, any family, any person, has to be a learning organism. We learn from the terrible attacks in Beirut in 1983 where 250 Americans were killed in the marine barracks in our embassy. We learned from the attacks on our embassies in Kenya and tans Tanzania in 1998, and we are learning from this latest terrible attack. We have to keep trying to figure out how we can be in dangerous places. I'm not one who says there is danger -- your responsibility is to get us out. No, my responsibility is to do the best job that I can leading a diverse group, relying on security professionals, so that we can be in the hard places to help make the hard choices.BAIER: I guess for the people who look at the ARB which singled out four state department officials, the ARB that you commissioned, they didn't interview you, but one of those officials was set to retire, three were reassigned, and no one was fired. So, there are people who look at that and say where is the accountability?CLINTON: Well, I understand that, and we gave very specific direction. I said you can go talk to anybody. You can see any document, anything you need to try to help me and help the American public and congress understand what happened. So, they had unfettered access to everyone. And they spoke to the people who they thought were involved in making the security decisions that, you know, they believed were unfortunately inadequate for what we faced.At the same time, they made very clear that there was no authority within our current law -- remember, this group was set up under existing American law, that you could not hold somebody accountable for a mistake. You know, there is a difference between getting it wrong and committing wrong. And what I asked for and what I hope the congress will do at the state department is pushing this on Capitol Hill -- is to give authority to be able to make certain decisions. Retention or retiring, so that people who may be responsible directly can be held accountable.BAIER: Did President Obama, during his first term, ever seriously disappoint you in any way?CLINTON: We had disagreements.(CROSSTALK)BAIER: Did he seriously disappoint you?CLINTON: No. No. He did not, Bret. You know, I have known several presidents quite well, including my husband, and I worked closely with President George W. Bush and the White House then after 9/11 and I served with President Obama. I disagree with all three of those presidents on certain things. I can tell that you right now, but I also believe each has tried to do what he thought was best for the country. And I would only be seriously disappointed in any president if I thought that in some way he was either ignoring or undermining the national interest. And, I never saw that in any of those three men. Even though as I say I disagreed with all of them on something.BAIER: In an interview with CBS, you were asked about politics and a viable woman if it's not you, and you replied quote politics is so unpredictable. Whoever runs has to recognize that the American system is probably the most difficult, even brutal in the world.CLINTON: Yeah. Yeah.BAIER: Have you been to more than 100 countries.CLINTON: I have.BAIER: Most brutal?CLINTON: Not in a beat-you-up sort of sense, but in an absolute marathon running the gauntlet day after day, most of our fellow democracies around the world, many of which are parliamentary, they choose a leader from among the elected officials who represent a constituency but not the whole country. That's not where they are elected from. Many have time limits whether it's 60 days, 90, or 120 days, so their campaigns don't go on for years. Many of them don't cost anywhere near as much. We require our candidates to raise all that money. Certainly, a lot of them have rules that prevent other money from flowing in, influence -- I mean, you list all the differences. Now, I'm quick to add that.BAIER: I guess people perked up with brutal, I suppose.CLINTON: Yeah. Well, you know, I think that that comes from experience, because when I ended my 2008 campaign, I was exhausted. I was drained. It was quite an experience. But I'm quick to add that, you know, part of it is we have a different idea about free expression, about the role of money in politics as the supreme court has recently said. And we are a big complex country. And so, getting through that gauntlet to be one of the nominees to run for president requires a lot of stamina.BAIER: Last thing, quickly. The Real Clear Politics average of major reliable poll, not just one, the average polls has the right track, wrong track breaking this way, 29 percent right track for the country, 64 percent wrong track. That's the average of polls. So, do you agree with the 64 percent?CLINTON: What I agree with is that many Americans are still feeling that they have not recovered from the Great Recession. They are still worried about their future, the future of their children. We could go down all the reasons why from -- you know, student debt to, you know, stagnant or decreasing incomes to income inequality, all of these factors that Americans are living with and they look and they say what happened to the American Dream? I was raised with that. I'm a product of it. I am proud to be a product of it. I had a great upbringing. I had a family that supported me. Great public education. All these opportunities as did my husband. And now, people are saying well, we think it's over. So, of course they are going to say, regardless I would argue who is president, I would say that most people are saying wait a minute, it's not working for me anymore. What do we do to get back on track toward people living up to their own God- given potential in this country that we love?BAIER: Thank you, Madam Secretary. Greta?CLINTON: Thank you, Bret.VAN SUSTEREN: Madam Secretary, you are a lawyer. President Obama is a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. And NSA spying on Americans violates the Fourth Amendment. Couldn't be plainer. You want to spy on Americans, you get a warrant. What do you think about that?CLINTON: Well, I think that we are finally taking stock of the laws that we passed after 9/11. I voted for some, and I voted against some. And people are saying wait a minute, we did all of this in an emergency in a hurry because we were you know understandably worried and scared, and now, we need to take a step back and figure out how we make sure that the balance between liberty and security is absolutely right for America.VAN SUSTEREN: Different question. Different question. When you go out and you seize American's stuff, you have to have a warrant.CLINTON: Yes.VAN SUSTEREN: The NSA seizing America's stuff, no warrant. And there are two options, either amend the Constitution or you get a warrant, that wasn't done. So, what should the American people think?CLINTON: Well, I think that the laws that were passed, again, post 9/11, gave very broad authority. And that authority was passed by the Congress. It was overseen by the FISA courts, and it was endorsed by executives in two administrations, both Bush and Obama. I think what has happened is people have said, OK, the emergency is over, and we want to get back to regular order. We want to make sure that we're not being spied on, that our privacy is not being violated. So, we want you to keep us safe. We want you to protect us. But we don't want Americans to be in any way fearful of their own government actions.VAN SUSTEREN: I don't think any American wants to be unsafe. And I think every American wants to give the authority of the government to seize things constitutionally.CLINTON: Yes.VAN SUSTEREN: The problem is we have this funny little called the fourth amendment. And it's actually quite plain. And I know everyone on Capitol Hill is trying to scurry and say we have got these laws and I hear you, too. But the fact is the fourth amendment is plain and says you need a warrant.CLINTON: Well, I think what you are going to find with the laws being amended and passed, one was just passed in the house. That the congress is trying to square Americans' constitutional right under the fourth amendment, and the necessity for information that can be connected to terrorist activity here at home or abroad. It's a really difficult balancing act. But you are 100 percent right, that we have to make some changes in order to secure that privacy, that constitutional right to privacy that Americans are due.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. Sergeant Tahmooressi is a marine. He is sitting in prison in Mexico since March 31st. And Mexico has not fast tracked the judicial process. He is there after making accidental turn. What can the United States do or what should the United States be doing to help this marine get fast-tracked through the judicial system because it was an accidental turn into Mexico?CLINTON: We should be doing and I assume we are, you know, I'm not there, so I can't speak directly to it, but we should be doing or I can tell you what I would be doing, burning up the telephone wires, sending, you know, envoys not just our ambassador, but others coming in, talking to the highest level Mexican officials, making it clear that this is really important to us. You know, we work with our counterparts, our friends in Mexico on a lot of issues. Obviously, it's something that is in our interest to do it as it is in theirs. When this kind of action happens and somebody who as you say made an accident turn who is serving our country ends up in a prison, that is just unacceptable.VAN SUSTEREN: Would you expect that if you were still secretary of state made a phone call that they would get on this immediately.CLINTON: Well, I'm not sure it would be only one phone call. We might have to make a couple of it, and call everybody that we could.VAN SUSTEREN: But we have enough diplomatic muscle with Mexico that it doesn't need to drag on this long.CLINTON: Well, again, I don't know the specifics, but I certainly expect everything is being done that can be done, but maybe we need to raise the decibels a little bit more.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, was very upset we were bugging her phone. Should would she be?CLINTON: Yes, she should be. That was absolutely uncalled for. I said that before. There is work that we need to do with the Germans and inside Germany. I well remember that some of the 9/11 hijackers got some of the training and some of the plotting went on in Hamburg, Germany, and we weren't able to penetrate that, and neither were our allies in the German intelligence service. That has nothing to go with Angela Merkel's cell phone, and that should be off-limits.VAN SUSTEREN: The sexism in politics. I agree there is sexism in politics. You write about it in your book. At one point, you write that the Obama administration -- Obama campaign rather, after John McCain selected Sarah Palin, that they called you (inaudible) and you issued something that was dismissive of her and you said no.CLINTON: That's right, I did. And I write about it in the book because I want to make clear, number one, that, you know, I don't think attacking women for being women or for trying to get the votes of other women makes a lot of sense. I think it's right or smart. So, I made clear I wouldn't that. And shortly after that, the campaign also agreed with it because I do believe that sexism is still a problem. It's not just in politics. It's in journalism, in business, and all kinds of human endeavors in our country. And we have to call it out wherever we find it, even with our friends, we have to say you know what? That's a line you shouldn't cross.VAN SUSTEREN: Is that done though? One of the most striking things to me, I think there were terrible sexist things said about you. I have no doubt about it, but perhaps the one I put in the compartment all its own is that Governor Sarah Palin, there was a media article that and many people ran with it in which it said that she was not the mother of her special needs' child. And I thought the silence was deafening. I was hoping that a woman would speak up. I was hoping that a democratic woman would speak up, but the silence was absolutely deafening.CLINTON: Well, I could not agree with you more, Greta. That those kinds of personal attacks, which I have had more than my share of because I have been in the political arena are, you know, despicable and they should be called out there. There's so much that moves so quickly in a presidential campaign as you know so well. I can't speak to who did or who didn't say anything. But I'm absolutely with you that any kind of personal attack should be repudiated.VAN SUSTEREN: It seems to me that some that would at least help some of the politics or women, if people would cross parties and actually speak up because it would make it unsafe then for people to be critical within their own party and actually focus on the issues. Sort of get, you know, I think that would sort of, you know, make it safer for women.CLINTON: I think that's a really good idea. I think we ought to try to enlist more women and men to do just that. I mean, it ought to be across the aisle. It ought to be across all segments of society. We don't do any service to ourselves, to each other, to young women coming up if we let those kind the comments stand, if we, you know, ignore the double standard, which still makes it very difficult for a lot of young women to feel that they have a role in the public sphere because of the way they are judged. So, I'm with you on that and maybe we could work together to try to get some kind of pact or agreement that people will speak up as we go forward in politics.VAN SUSTEREN: I read your book and I was actually disturbed by this. Richard Holbrooke who served our nation with distinction in many ways, helped to handle the war in Bosnia, negotiate the Dayton accords, that when he was working for you, people over at the White House would sometimes roll their eyes at him. To me, I thought the arrogance of those people at the White House not respecting his contribution, that bothered me.CLINTON: You know, I think it was related to age. Just like we were just talking about what's related to gender. I think a lot of younger people, and I wouldn't exclude any part of society, wouldn't be just at the White House or any one place, may not appreciate some of the struggles that our country has gone through, even in fairly recent times.VAN SUSTEREN: The way I read it in your book is that these -- I take it wasn't the president because -- but I mean someone below the president, you don't name them, but the arrogance that they thought they knew better.(CROSSTALK)VAN SUSTEREN: And actually, I think that makes it hard to sort of govern if your staff thinks that they are such know it all's.CLINTON: Well, I think part of it was Richard's experiences in Bosnia and his experiences going back it Vietnam, which he often talked about and drew comparisons with, were not understood to be as relevant as Richard and I thought they were because we both had lived through both of those experiences. First in Vietnam as young people, he was a diplomat, and then, with the war in Bosnia. I view it as you know kind of a missed opportunity, perhaps, for people who didn't have the personal experience to have learned more. But one thing about Richard Holbrooke is he was indefatigable, and he was used to people saying OK, Richard, it never stopped him. He just kept going. I also talked in the book how he followed me into a lady's room in Pakistan once because he was trying to get me to agree to something, and I was still thinking about it. And he thought I needed to agree right then. He was not bothered by any of this. I was the observer who thought what a shame that people aren't really listening to someone who is one of the great diplomats of our time.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. President Obama has called the IRS scandal a ""phony scandal."" Is it a phony scandal?CLINTON: Well, I think any time IRS is involved, for many people, it's a real scandal. I think that there are some challenges that rightly need to be made to what is being said and I assume that the inquiry will continue. So, I don't have the details, but I think what President Obama means there is there really wasn't a lot of, you know, evidence that this was deliberate but that's why the investigation needs to continue.VAN SUSTEREN: But it's really hard not to say it's deliberate whether you have now, we find out that there are two years worth of pertinent emails missing. It would be almost irrational not to be extremely suspicious. You know, I wouldn't say phony. I would say this is real to many Americans.CLINTON: Well, I think maybe the right thing to say is let's investigate it, but do it as a nonpartisan, as fair-minded, and fair and balanced as we can.VAN SUSTEREN: I have heard that.CLINTON: Because we want to know what the facts are.VAN SUSTEREN: If you call it phony, you are trying to throw the dog off the scent.CLINTON: Well, I think not just the president, but anybody who says that is basically saying, you know, the circus around the investigations, you know that -- you are a long-time observer, are really trying to confuse what is happening. It's important to get back to very professional inquiries that can't be accused of politicizing because somebody may be worried about the answer they get or they don't get, and let's try to find out, you know, what the facts are.VAN SUSTEREN: Secretary Clinton, thank you. I have read the book. Of course, I traveled on many of these trips. It's a fun read. Thank you very much. And that concludes our special joint interview.CLINTON: Thank you.BAIER: Madam Secretary, thank you very much.CLINTON: Thank you so much, Bret. My pleasure.BAIER: Interesting back and forth.CLINTON: Thank you, Greta."	['Obama', 'McCain', 'Hill', 'Dayton']	[]
