"This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" September 7, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle along with Juan Williams, Eric Bolling, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five."" Did Hillary Clinton and her staff intentionally obstruct justice destroying evidence in the middle of an investigation, and did the FBI know about it and ignore it? Bureau notes reveal an IT staffer deleted Clinton e-mail archives after a Benghazi committee ordered for all e-mails to be preserved. The head of the House Oversight Committee says, ""Congress will investigate.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JASON CHAFFETZ, HOUSE OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: I don't think Hillary Clinton gets it. The fact of the matter is they did not look at this and the House of Representatives, also a branch of government, also gets to look into this. Of course we're going to do hearings. We're going to get to the truth of this.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: A former FBI assistant director takes great issue with how Director James Comey handled the Clinton probe. He thinks Comey gave the secretary a big pass.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAMES KALLSTROM, FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: The FBI director is playing politics. The FBI director does not take the most famous, the best law enforcement agency in the world and politicize it by letting thing out, you know, Labor Day weekend. I mean, I just think that's the worst thing he could do. He should be absolutely ashamed of himself. And this interview, you know, this interview, why wasn't it recorded? Why wasn't there a transcript? Why wasn't she under oath?(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Why? And there could be more stunning developments soon on Clinton's e-mails. WikiLeaks is threatening a documents and it could be a September surprise.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JULIAN ASSANGE, FOUNDER OF WIKILEAKS: The first batch is reasonably soon, we're quite confident about it now. We might put out some teasers as I don't want to promise anything because we have to see how the formatting goes, but we might put out some teasers as early as the next week or the week after.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right Dana, so the story not going away. It started out with just casting a whole pal (ph) on the FBI with these documents on fun Friday. You heard the comments there from ""The Kelly File"" from last night saying this was inappropriate. This is essentially putting shame on the FBI which is, you know, the world's most favorite -- famous investigatory agency. And now we have that follow up with the fact that there may start to be a bit of leaks of documents coming sooner than we anticipated.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Well I'd like to be on record saying I do not support encouraging Julian Assange to release more American secrets. I think it's the American that we should -- Hillary Clinton should be more transparent. The FBI should not have done this on the weekend. I think that the FBI should release the entire file, just release the entire file because it's going to drip out. And instead of allowing all of this speculation, you would imagine that James Comey, who I think really cares about his integrity and his position and his reputation, probably regrets, I would hope, regrets doing this on a Friday. I'm sure maybe the PR people talked to him into it, they -- oh, it will be fine. It's not fine and this is not going to end for a while, but I do not think that in any way that the Americans should be relying on Julian Assange who released documents that led to the several -- well, of several, but we certainly know that at least, at a least one or two people who were covert operators who ended up with their lives lost because of these types of leaks, so I don't think -- I'm not for encouraging that, but I am for a lot more transparency. I don't see how Hillary Clinton gets away with all of this, especially the 13 different devices. That to me, I just -- after she said, ""I used one device for convenience."" And we've known that hasn't been true for a while because we knew about the iPad and a couple of other things, but 13 devices and they destroyed with a hammer.GUILFOYLE: Destruct, yeah.PERINO: I mean, come on. There's a lot more there. Plus, I think that the chronology is very curious. So she keeps the e-mails for a long time. Then the Department of State asked for some them back, ask for them back. She gives some of them back. Then the stories hit that the server is out there. So then, all of a sudden the e-mails that she returned to state, it's not a complete list. And we find out later that the rest of them were deleted by BleachBit. I don't see how they try to clean that up. I know that the Clinton campaign is going to want everyone to move on. I just don't know how we move on until the FBI releases the entire file.GUILFOYLE: All right Eric, so there are a lot of problems here with it. There's the destruction of evidence, the 13 devices, the -- let's call it loose relationship with the truth saying one device was used, 13 were used and now, you know, this constant kind of drip of information of e-mails showing a total disregard for the policies, the procedures, and then unfortunately we don't have the transparency because they didn't do a recording of the interview with Hillary Clinton. And from the notes we know that you mentioned yesterday, there was very little pushback across examination to like track down and lockdown the details.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Yeah, what -- if she thought she was ABC in a line of alphabeticals where A and B .PERINO: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: . that was never asked.PERINO: Or D.BOLLING: Or D. Also today, I think Jason Chaffetz, the congressman, said that he believes that she -- they were buying these devices on -- use devices on eBay. That's one another reason why he wants to open the -- reopen the investigation. Used devises on -- BlackBerry's on eBay. I mean this --GUILFOYLE: You can't get them. I tried it one time.BOLLING: You can't make this stuff up. I mean it's insane how bad, how poorly this whole thing was managed. And as Dana obviously right, we points that yeah, we keep the -- the harder you push, the more e-mails you find. Now we got the FBI found 13,000 more e-mails that Hillary Clinton said weren't ever there, but apparently they were. But again, that still doesn't -- I guess we'll never find the 33,000 e-mails. And the point being made is, if the only way you can get it is through Assange leak or some of these things that Assange says, literally says, she knew about, C stood for classified or confidential, because she used it several times and he has proof that, you may start to see it. The point is who is Hillary Clinton? You're finding out who Hillary Clinton is, is someone willing to lie to the American people.GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: Apparently, she's not willing to lie if Assange is being straight- forward, willing to lie to the FBI as well. She has always believed that Clintons have always believed they're above the law and this is tying up exactly who the Clintons are. So before you vote, you want to know who you gonna vote for. And lastly, I just I'll just point out, that if you destroy 33,000 -- destroy them, not keep them, not hold them with your lawyer, not wait until they get subpoenaed, if you destroy them, you're destroying evidence. There's no question about it. If you or I did that, Kimberly --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: If the IRS wanted some details of some transaction we did, we would be going to jail if we said in advance of that investigation.GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: I'm sorry, I destroyed the documents.GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: But we're too small. When it's bigger and bigger and massive and has global implications as a presidency would, apparently it's OK.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, it sounds, Juan, like she would be a character of on the Sopranos, because they used the bleach, they used a hammer to clean up the crime scene. I mean great lengths by the secretary of state and her staff to avoid turning over evidence that they knew was potentially needed to further an investigation. I mean that's pretty outrageous from a prosecutor's standpoint.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, sure it's interesting to listen because I'm still waiting for there to be evidence of a crime. I mean FBI says there's no evidence of any crime, but you guys are upset about the weekend release, you think that the guy who was working for the server company --BOLLING: For the real people in the world, Juan .WILLIAMS: Let me just say --BOLLING: . destroying evidence in a crime.WILLIAMS: Let me just say she didn't destroyed it. If she destroyed evidence there would be a charge. There's no such charge. What we see here -- look, I mean -- people .(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: . I had politicians say to me, get off my butt, you all you are is a muckraker. There's no muckraking going on here. All you guys are doing is complaining about when this was release, why didn't the FBI be more aggressive with her. You guys are throwing stuff at the wall and hoping something sticks. Nothing is sticking. This is more Benghazi, more e-mail. This is just feeding Hillary's thing that, you know what, these people are insatiable. They just want to bring me down. So what we get is Jason Chaffetz is now is a political arm using Congress as a political arm of the Trump campaign. That's what's going on here.GUILFOYLE: All right Juan, we see so clearly now that you explained that all. All right Greg, so what, what do you think? This is something is going to be significant that's gonna continue to dawn for -- I don't know.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Even if the law -- it's not just about that laws are broken, it's that in this era of cyberterror, these things actually matter, to have somebody who is so ignorant about technology. I mean she thinks that hammering your BlackBerry destroys information. That's like smashing your clock to freeze time.WILLIAMS: It worked (ph).GUTFELD: It doesn't work that way. Thank God she didn't use carrier pigeons.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: She would have strangled them with her bare hands.PERINO: She would have been in mess.GUTFELD: Yeah, I know that. And also the idea of releasing bad news before a holiday, yeah, it's not illegal, but it's insulting to the American people and it's obviously an evasive strategy.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: And it doesn't work in any other part of society. A doctor is not going to wait until Christmas Eve to tell you that you have cancer. That is not what you do in real life. And yet in somehow in politics and in media, they think that we're so stupid that if you do it before Labor Day, we'll just magically forget about everything and on Tuesday everything will be different. It may not be illegal, but it's shameless, it's cynical, it's disgusting, it's wrong. What else -- what also is wrong is relying on Julian Assange. Six years ago, conservatives were calling for his head for his arrest for the government to do something about WikiLeaks, and now they're cheering him on because why he's trying to manipulate the election to hurt the democrats. But what if the world -- the shoe were on the other foot? What if Assange actually had Trump's medical records? Or had Trump's tax returns? Do you think that there would be conservative leaders to be cheering him on? I think not.BOLLING: And I would hope so. I mean I hope it would go both ways.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: It's information that the public should know about candidates they should get it out. James Comey .GUILFOYLE: Yes.BOLLING: . says, or released a statement saying defending his timing of the release saying that we don't, quote, ""We don't play games,"" the FBI. Maybe the FBI investigators don't play games, but the timing of the release certainly feels like game playing.PERINO: It's the PR department, come on. Yeah.GUILFOYLE: Well, this is in a memo to the staff and saying that also that he felt that this wasn't a prosecutable case. So this was just coming in as well.PERINO: Well, the other thing I was going to add to that in terms of the timing is, I think that it's also very old school thinking. I don't think that waiting to release things on a Friday works anymore, anyway. Mostly because people generally, I think 60 or even up to 70 percent of people get most of their news now from their --BOLLING: And that the shows on Saturday.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: Well --BOLLING: Right?GUTFELD: That's where I get my news.BOLLING: Hello? Hello?GUTFELD: Just then.PERINO: But from social media, so they're getting it --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: And the reason I think some of Hillary's poll numbers continue to go down is because it's not that people are necessarily watching our show that we appreciate everyone who is watching our show, it's that if you release something on Friday, that doesn't mean that it just goes away and no one ever hears about it. All weekend long people are on their phones .GUILFOYLE: They travel. Yeah.PERINO: . and they're checking and it is like -- and it's more of an immediate response as well, and it sticks in your mind. More so, even than television commercials they're finding that's what the research is saying. So, I think that this game of trying to release things on a Friday is over anyway, so retire it as a tactic.GUTFELD: But then again, they're also playing on the fact that because we have so much information that we will forget no matter what, which is somewhat true. I mean, the tragedies that would affect us for weeks, we move on in 48 hours.BOLLING: Or something else happens .GUTFELD: It's something --BOLLING: . on the weekend.PERINO: Yeah.BOLLING: You know, three-day weekends, a lot of things .WILLIAMS: But you know --BOLLING: . can happen like a candidate actually being draped in a prayer cloth, which happened this past Saturday in Detroit, if you remember that.WILLIAMS: Oh.GUILFOYLE: OK, but --WILLIAMS: I was going to say that if, if there was something substantive in what had been released Friday, we would have it front and center and we would still be talking about it, because I don't think anybody's dump or not gonna remember what was relieve, if in fact she doesn't mean terrible. Now --GUTFELD: But those e-mails --PERINO: Don't you think 13 devices --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I mean suspicious. You can say, I can agree, suspicious are crazy .GUILFOYLE: Oh, come on. Lying about it?WILLIAMS: . but it's not illegal. Anyway, what is illegal?GUTFELD: I mean that's not enough.WILLIAMS: Right.GUTFELD: This is not illegal?BOLLING: That she lied. That she didn't break the law in line?WILLIAMS: I think that was the great hope that she would get indicted .GUILFOYLE: But no, but that's not like she -- yeah.WILLIAMS: . and it would hamstring her campaign.BOLLING: Or how about that people realize that she's willing .GUILFOYLE: But it's not what kind of a moral and ethical equivocation.WILLIAMS: Look, I tell you --BOLLING: . she's willing to lie.WILLIAMS: I tell you where the media is falling down. And I think this is going to, you know, calls all of you .(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: . somewhat (inaudible) is nobody's talking about Trump actually paying a fine, actually having been found guilty of making a campaign contribution through his foundation that was in violation of the law. Nobody says a word, (inaudible).GUILFOYLE: Right. Well, in fact --WILLIAMS: Hillary Clinton low bar for Trump .GUILFOYLE: Juan, that --WILLIAMS: Once again.GUILFOYLE: Due to the word count that I was keeping on you, we are talking so much that actually was the second topic that we were running at --WILLIAMS: Well, go right ahead.GUILFOYLE: Well, you just talked about it. Yeah.WILLIAMS: I think we should talk about it.GUILFOYLE: We --WILLIAMS: I don't understand.GUILFOYLE: We were talking about it.WILLIAMS: I don't understand how he gets away --GUILFOYLE: Bring us the pudding.WILLIAMS: He gets away with bankrupt casinos. He gets away with, you know not paying contractors with Trump universities being investigate, California, Florida, elsewhere, New York State; and nobody says a word.GUILFOYLE: Well, he says, ""Hey, Hillary Clinton and you can't release your e-mails and I'll release my tax returns.""WILLIAMS: Oh my, gosh. I'll just -- you know, I just think it's the double standard, but again, I think Hillary Clinton is held to one standard. And you know Trump, if he doesn't trip over his shoelaces, everybody says, wow, you did pretty well.GUILFOYLE: I don't think so. I think he gets --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: And then the media --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: I want to lose its $25,000 donation which was paid back and you're talking about the Clinton Foundation that has raised somewhere around $1.5 to $2 billion .WILLIAMS: Yeah, and so much good.BOLLING: . and some of it being under .WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: . questionable means and --WILLIAMS: Look, I -- look, as you know, I think that a lot of the appearances, but Trump actually was found to have acted improperly. Not just there, but in campaign contributions and here in New York City to the city council, to the New York State legislature. This has been going on for decades.GUTFELD: Juan, I have a solution, have Pam Bondi investigate Hillary.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Yeah, but beside that .(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: . let's keep in mind poor Pam Bondi, who is a friend of mine, I mean she's not somebody who is one of the state sponsors of terrorism or a country that supports Sharia Law and crimes against gays and women and, I mean it's unbelievable -- anyway. All right, back to Clinton Foundation. Ahead, the war over who would do a better job fighting the war on terror. That's next. Please stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Hillary Clinton took some new shots at Donald Trump yesterday in their escalating feud over who will do a better job protecting America.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: When it comes to fighting ISIS, he has been all over the map. You would have to literally map it out. He's talked about letting Syria become a free zone for ISIS. Look at the map, Donald.(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: He's talked about sending in American ground troops, not on my watch. He's even talked about using nuclear weapons. He says he has a secret plan to defeat ISIS, but the secret is he has no plan.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Trump, of course, struck back today, will also offering new details on his counter-terror strategy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: In a Trump administration our actions in the Middle East will be tempered by realism. The current strategy of toppling regimes with no plan for what to do the day after only produces power vacuums that are filled simply by terrorists. Immediately after taking office, I will ask my generals to present to me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS unlike my opponent, my foreign policy who will emphasize diplomacy, not destruction. Hillary Clinton's legacy in Iraq, Libya, Syria, has produced only turmoil and suffering and death.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: And tonight there's a commander-in-chief forum, Hillary Clinton is going to speak first, Donald Trump after him and -- I'm sorry, for her, excuse me. Here's one thing and I think is interesting, Kimberly .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: . if I were Donald Trump I would spend the next couple of hours thinking about how he's going to connect these two dots. When he says he's going to ask the military for a plan, give me a plan within 30 days on how you going to defeat ISIS, but then he says, ""I'm going to use diplomacy."" I think what he should do is say, I would not just use the military, I would try to find out what are all the tools across the federal government from a financial standpoint and also from a State Department standpoint to try to bring that all together because otherwise, I think you might find that she can kind of run rings around him on that issue.GUILFOYLE: No, I think it's a great advice when you talk about it on the show in terms of trying, kind of a broad based approach, sort of like the octopus to strangle it and suffocate and destroy ISIS, right? So that has multiple arms and options whether you're going to follow the money and cut off supplies, cut off the funding that's coming in from oil sales and what they've been able to get there.PERINO: Right.GUILFOYLE: Go after their infrastructure. I mean, ISIS is actually like having officers in charge, printing money, issuing, you know, passports and identification, all of that has to shutdown to be able to eliminate their modes and means and operations of travel, the routes that they use to do their supplies, hospitals that are supporting and taking them in when they're committing these acts of terrorism in addition to use of force on the ground, more assets on the ground to be able to get more real time intelligence, cyber security and hitting them in that way in terms of attacking their means of operation and communications to disrupt. So there are a lot of options there and one thing that I am particularly passionate about is rules of engagement. So -- and then listen, listen to the people. He says he will give them 30-days so the Pentagon to come forward with a precise and comprehensive plan about how to destroy. One of the other things we've been hearing today is, it's not just about ISIS, this whole war of radical Islamic jihad can take on a new name and more if you do not cut it out completely and try to strangle it by all those means necessary - -PERINO: The other thing that was strange to me, Greg, in that, in her clip is where she says she's taking options off the table.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: She says in that the thing that .GUILFOYLE: A problem.PERINO: . ground troops is not an option, so basically it's continuing Obama's way of disarming America, which is basically, I think has hurt our diplomacy efforts as well.GUTFELD: Well, she said two things are interesting. Regarding ISIS, she says Trump's all over the map. Well, that's because ISIS all over the map.GUILFOYLE: All over the map.GUTFELD: How did that happen?GUILFOYLE: There you go.GUTFELD: And then she says she won't be sending in ground troops or not on her watch. So, let me get this straight, she is not transparent to the American people, but she's more than transparent to ISIS. She's willing to let them know what we're not going to do.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: That has to stop. You know, I listened to Trump's speech. It was like Michael Moore in spandex, it was packed tight. It had a lot of specific which appeals to me.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: I like hearing all of that stuff. It makes me happy. The question is, does it appeal these days to everyone else, to the people that either independents or young people? Will they watch this forum? And 65 years ago, men and women, they understood the risks and the achievements of war and the shared experiences of combat. And now the shared experiences for so many people are video games and I'm not talking about our military. I'm talking about everybody else that's home that is so distracted and unaffected by the experiences outside our boarders, so that when you talk about national security and you talk about defense and terrorism, it doesn't really affect them. That scares me.GUILFOYLE: OK.PERINO: Eric, I was going to say something about the fact that you have the military piece, which I think -- I'm sorry, I just saw that you circled on there, but you know the military support that Donald Trump has been able to garner. And then what she was saying yesterday, which is why I have all these officers, but I actually think that below the officer level, I think that there is a lot of support for Trump.BOLLING: Is that yesterday the headlines were Donald Trump got 88 officers to sign on board and then like two hours later, she got 95 officers, so they went back and forth. The poll I was talking about the CNN poll from yesterday, they talked among current and former military, Trump has a wide lead. He's up on her by 19 points. Here's important what happened today, though, Trump delivered that speech in Philadelphia.GUILFOYLE: Yes.BOLLING: He kind of tested out some lines and great points out. It was packed. He talked about NATO. That got a lot of applause. I assume you'll see of that tonight when they do this thing over being trapped. Now the audience being trapped is military people who haven't been as friendly to Trump in the past. So he had to bring some really favorable lines. I'm thinking, I'm guessing a lot of that was tested. So he talked about NATO paying their fair share. Five people are supporting us included, are supporting the vast majority of NATO. Then he added a five-point plan, beefing up the military, navy, air force, marines, army, as well; 540,000 standing army up for 490, currently. That got a lot of applause. But he hit one line, and for me it was like, well, look at that.GUILFOYLE: Wow.BOLLING: The whole place stood up. He said, you know, towards and he said, ""We are one nation under one got saluting one American flag."" And he got the whole place to stand up. It was a simple line, but it underscores difference between the patriotism of a republican Donald Trump and the perception of the democrats who have got the military of the past, eight years or so. So I think tonight will be very, very interesting. I think you'll see a lot of the same like you saw in Philly today, tonight at 8 o'clock.PERINO: Go ahead.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. I was just going to say, you know when I was listening to all the comments, you know, at the table, and Greg said he'd like to hear the specifics and you referenced the five-point plan, it seems like this is a very, you know, tailored message on point that some saw attention to details been put in to it, which been a criticism people so they want some specifics for him. It seems to me that he is listening, perhaps, or at least he will going to actually repeat some of these things, maybe from people like General Flynn or some of the other advisers, Dana, that have been trying to advise him, you know, on foreign policy, on national security or the military, which also may start to factor and affect people's opinion that this is someone that won't just go off fly off the cuff, like you know, Juan thinks that will actually listen and assemble people for best practices.PERINO: Well, it's not just Juan.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Well, no.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I mean to say, Juan just did that. So thank you.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, you know what I'm saying.WILLIAMS: Because I think it's overwhelming.GUILFOYLE: It's a point of concern.WILLIAMS: You know, 61 percent of Americans think Trump has too little to non-existed experience in dealing with foreign policy. So when it comes to foreign policy, Clinton holds a 14 point lead on who would better handle American foreign policy. When it comes to who would better deal with nukes. It's not even close, it's double digits. People say, oh, Clinton not Trump. The real issue for me, Greg --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: And terrorism.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Trump was up by five or six yesterday, but that flips back and forth. But what I was going to say to you Greg was, the spandex thing, I'd loved that.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Yeah --WILLIAMS: But I would love some details, because remember at one point Trump said, ""I can't tell you my plan.""GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: Because that have been my political opponents might use it or .GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: . then it wouldn't be unpredictable and we should be unpredictable for the bad guys .GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: . right?PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: But he never ever reveals the plan.BOLLING: Did you see it today?WILLIAMS: I saw them --BOLLING: Active armies.WILLIAMS: You don't know.BOLLING: Up to 50,000 .WILLIAMS: No.BOLLING: . to five corps .WILLIAMS: Let me just --BOLLING: . marine put 36 battalions up from 23.WILLIAMS: You're switching the topic, Eric.BOLLING: Navy, 350 surface ships versus (inaudible) now.WILLIAMS: Eric, you're switching the topic.BOLLING: I will hear --WILLIAMS: This is about rebuilding the military that he has condemned and damned as incompetent. Which is, I'm amazed that anybody in the military would say, oh, yeah, U.S. military incompetent? Our U.S. military is the greatest on earth. But anyway, you're switching the topic. That's about him saying he wants to put more money into the military, when in fact what we're talking about is how to take on terrorist and ISIS, ISIL, whatever you want to call it. And Trump says, ""Oh, yeah. I've got a plan, it will knock them out."" Now he's saying, ""Oh, yeah, the generals. I'm going to tell my generals to give me a plan in 30 days.""GUTFELD: That was the plan.WILLIAMS: That was the plan?GUTFELD: The secret plan was asking the generals for a secret plan .WILLIAMS: Oh, yeah, yeah.GUTFELD: . which was brilliant.BOLLING: And the scary part?WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: That beats Clinton by six percentage points.WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is ridiculous.PERINO: I really don't think that the military -- whoever wins that the military can't device a plan unless they know what the new president's policy position are going to be.GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: Like what are you willing to do? How much would you be willing to allow -- are you gonna willing to change the rules of engagement?GUILFOYLE: Yup.PERINO: If we capture a terrorist, can we take them to GITMO? Are we gonna keep that? All of these things, actually a lot of that policy decisions has to be made at the top before the military can deliver a plan. And does it bother anybody, especially on the libertarian side. He's now talking about busting through the sequester caps .BOLLING: Yeah.PERINO: . which is the thing that had cut back on the military budget. I'm actually -- I'm for that by to criticize for being for that, but I believe that we should spend more money on the military. But libertarians, like if you're leaning in that direction, you think there's too much waste brought .GUTFELD: Yeah, they'll --PERINO: . to be use in the military.GUTFELD: They'll say if there are, they aren't spending (inaudible). And they're probably right. I mean, we went through that whole era of the expensive toilet seat from, I guess the late '70s. No one remembers that.PERINO: What do you think on that, on the budget issue?BOLLING: Well, I think there was -- he had, again, today in Philadelphia he tested it in front of a big group and he got a very big round of applause, because people are ready to have our military beefed up, more money spent on the military.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. And you know why?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Remember strength through power .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: Are probably through (inaudible).GUTFELD: He's through strength.BOLLING: Strength. Yeah, and that was the Reagan's mantra and philosophy. Spend more, beef up your military and don't get into the fight. I mean, don't get into the fight that Hillary Clinton has voted in favor of, Iraq.GUTFELD: You never win a war by underestimating.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: That's because we don't have enough resources. The idea is that you have to be able to fight two proposed major areas of conflict. And so say for example, if you had to deal with like Russia and China and in another region, and we have such a commitment to resources already in the Middle East, it's taxing in terms of our --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: And most military leaders do think that you could cut the budget.WILLIAMS: Yeah.PERINO: They're talking about reductions in force.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Most Americans think that --PERINO: But if you're going to Virginia to give a speech, you say that you're increasing the military.WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah. But you get automatic applause.GUILFOYLE: Unless you --WILLIAMS: But I just want to hammer home a point here which is, you know what, you have to have the support of the American people. That's why putting troops on the ground is not popular right now, republicans or democrats, and yet from Trump it's like, oh, yeah, we're going to risk or wild mouth (ph) will kill their families -- people don't want that. That's not what Americans want.BOLLING: All right. Let's switch gears here right now.As the 15th anniversary of 9/11 approaches, a new memorial controversy is growing in New York. A Muslim group is offended by two words in a monument for victims in the town of Owego: ""Islamic terrorists.""The Islamic Organization of Southern -- of the Southern Tier thinks it's unfairly pointing all Muslims with a broad brush and wants the word ""Islamic"" scrubbed. A town supervisor says it's not going to happen.We'll bring it around, Greg. So here it is. PC going amok. Do we listen to this Islamic group, this group of Muslims who say Islamic terrorism is offensive to them?GUTFELD: Why did they attack? Why did these terrorists attack the World Trade Center? Was it a political act? No. Was it an act of imperialism to take territory away? No. It was an ideological act; it was an act based on ideas. Where did those ideas come from? Islamism. That's why they did it. they hate the West, and Islamism, the whole goal is to take over the west, take over the world.And by the way, no longer calling Islamic terror, you know, Islamic terror. It doesn't change anything. You know, melanoma, you can not call it cancer; it's still cancer. So the language, just because you're changing the language, the critics here, you're not changing the truth. We all know you just call attention to it, and you actually harm Islam, because you end up blurring the lines between Islam and Islamism and radical Islam.WILLIAMS: So the other side of this argument is that they say they would prefer that they put in al Qaeda. They said this was al Qaeda terrorism, but I don't think there's any argument it was Islamic. The argument really is are you, then, encouraging bigotry against Muslims by putting it in there?GUTFELD: That's always the argument.WILLIAMS: Well, that's the argument and, you know, I appreciate it. But again, I have to come down on Greg's side: I think the truth is the truth. I don't think you want to do things that are intentionally provocative.BOLLING: That's the anti-Obama idea, though.WILLIAMS: What's that?BOLLING: President Obama would never say, ""Islamic terrorism."" Would never say, ""Islamic terrorism.""WILLIAMS: We are not at war with Islam. We are not. What Greg said...GUILFOYLE: We are at war with radical Islamic terrorism.WILLIAMS: ... was -- Greg's point that it was an ideologically-inspired attack on 9/11, and that's a fact.GUILFOYLE: OK, but the problem is -- OK, so if you listen to Jeh Johnson, the familiar theme which we also have heard, you know, espoused in some of the theories, the rhetoric from President Obama and from his administration, is one, essentially, of victimhood, that we need the federal government to be able to protect you from injustices, from racial targeting, whether it's through the emphasis and use of the arm of the DOJ, et cetera, to the FBI and getting involved at local levels; municipalities and police departments across the country to address and redress some of the injustices that people feel that have happened to them.And then what he's saying is drawing a parallel to, as well, to Muslim- Americans, which I like the point that he said there, yes, law-abiding American Muslims that have fought and served this country and are against radical Islamic terrorism and terrorists just like we are. That, I think, is a helpful point, but the rest of it is overbroad. I mean, it's not America the punisher.BOLLING: Dana, the monument didn't say against Islamists. It said Islamic terrorists.PERINO: I actually think that that is something that people who are peaceful Muslims should be able to differentiate. And I think they should run with it and say, ""Yes, that was separate to us.""We're not going to change that monument, OK? That's not going to happen. And imagine, if there was a group of Christians that went to Mecca, and they blew something up, do you think for one second they would not say it was Christian terrorists? Of course they would.And I think just -- I think naming the enemy, which was Islamic terrorism. We're not saying Muslims or Islam is a bad religion, but that we're at war with them, but that did happen. They shouted ""Allahu akbar"" as they were doing their terrible deeds that resulted in 3,000 Americans dying.BOLLING: We're going to leave it right there.Next, a taxpayer-funded university undoes the work of the civil rights movement by separating students by their race once again. An important story you'll want to know about, just ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: So if you think time travel is impossible, then you haven't made it to Cal State L.A., where they're now segregating students based on skin color. Amazing.According to CSLA, the school's under fire for offering separate housing for black students in response to claims of racism. Apparently, this new housing was triggered by insensitive remarks and micro-aggressions made by professors and students. So get this: the solution to racism is segregation. You know who would agree with that? Racists.Somehow, I don't think this is the unity that we all had in mind.So as inclusion is now seen as some kind of appeasement, the left view separatism as the answer to their grievance. The natural result of identity politics, where conflict resolution is replaced by polarization.After America's grand experiment of inclusion, we now return to tribal splintering, retreating to the instinct of surrounding like with like. It indulges the worst urges. It's based on the toxic assumption that empathy cannot exist between different pigments, genders and orientations.So where do we go from here? As the country splits into factions, be it through separatist movements or infamy, through divisive symbolism or reparations that reward anger over achievement, it only leads in one direction. Down and then apart.All right, Juan. I go to you for no particular reason.WILLIAMS: Oh, yes. I wonder why.GUTFELD: Yes. Isn't it weird to you that progressives and racists reach similar conclusions: separation?WILLIAMS: Yes. I'm so disheartened by it. But I must say, it's all over the country, so I see it out in California. You see Davis, Berkeley, University of Connecticut here in the East, but you also have smaller institutions that are adopting it.And the idea, Greg, is that you know what? Oftentimes the black kids, the Hispanic kids come from a different orientation than the majority white population, because they might come from poor quality high schools or they might be income less, and so they're kind of like not feeling accepted. And so to be around their peers makes it for more support.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: You know, support of learning. I understand all that. I'm sensitive to all that.But the larger picture just cannot be ignored, which is the picture you drew, which is that you are saying that segregation is a good thing. In my book, segregation is never a good thing, especially in a diverse society.One last point to quickly make. Which is that if you want to succeed in America, you better know how to deal with all kinds of people.GUTFELD: Exactly.WILLIAMS: Because your boss may be a Puerto Rico woman, as is my case here on ""The Five"". You never know, right?GUILFOYLE: I'm your boss mamma.WILLIAMS: That's what I'm telling you. Well, you never know, that, you know, you might have to sit next to a white guy every day and argue with him. You never know. So you've got to be -- you've got to be comfortable, right? You've got to be, you've got to know -- you can't just say, ""Oh, yes, I'm only going to deal with people who are just like me.""I think, in fact, that is condescending. I understand that you want those kids to feel comfortable, you want to give them some added support. You can do it for veterans. You can do it for women, et cetera, but separate housing?BOLLING: Can I just point out, that's a wonderful looking tie, Juan.WILLIAMS: Is that a condescending comment?BOLLING: No, no. Don't be micro-aggressed on that.There's a difference, though, choice, right? So a lot of people do segregate by choice. Black fraternities in colleges, right?WILLIAMS: White fraternities.BOLLING: White fraternities in colleges. Athletes in colleges.GUTFELD: I can't join a sorority.BOLLING: Well, you can.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: You can be my little sister.BOLLING: But choice is the difference here, whereas I assume their segregation is coming mandated segregation.GUTFELD: It's offered. You don't have to do, but it's there. But it's also -- it's a state-funded school, which is kind of, you know...PERINO: I -- so I grew up in Denver, and that was one of the cities that was the first to try bussing to integrate the schools. And it was hard. I got up -- I had to get up much earlier than just walking six blocks to school. We had to bus 20 miles in.I have to say, I think that experience helped me be a lot more empathetic, I believe. So I feel like we've come a long way. Like, don't take us backwards. And maybe there's more work to do. Maybe you've got to put another R.A. in there, but you know, I think...GUTFELD: Why don't you -- OK, wouldn't the solution be if you believe there's racist attacks in various shapes or forms, why don't you get the evidence and punish and not just say, ""Look, everybody separate."" Doesn't that make more sense.GUILFOYLE: Absolutely. I think this is lazy. This is a lazy approach that is not making people safer, better, stronger, more fulfilled or hearing their voice and their expression of what they've gone through.Have forums. Have weekly meetings where everybody gathers in, like, the community center in the dorm, et cetera, to talk about their feelings or what they might be thinking. And make it more inclusive and have people assimilate and work together, just like you have to do in real life every day when you walk into different buildings across the country.That's where the growth opportunity is. That's where people are going to understand each other better like we sit at this table and we all come from different background. And you learn and you listen, and you grow and evolve.GUTFELD: But sadly college isn't real life. They're trying to divorce you from what you will be facing when you're outside.PERINO: A four-day vacation from real life.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: Four years, excuse me. I mean, I was advanced.GUTFELD: Of course you were.GUILFOYLE: Four days.GUTFELD: Yes, yes. I credit you on that. The chief diversity officer at Clark U. says that they don't want to say, ""You guys"" anymore. You can't say, ""You guys.""PERINO: Can you say, ""Y'all""?GUTFELD: I don't know. You all.GUILFOYLE: I was on an all-girl floor.PERINO: I was, too.GUILFOYLE: There were boys underneath. They find a way.GUTFELD: All right. Moving on.It's a stereotype that's been around forever. Women like to shop, and men don't. We will discuss this pressing topic later.GUILFOYLE: Yes.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: I've been saying this for years. They need more chairs in stores for vagrant husbands like me who are left standing while their wives are shopping. And this next story proves I'm right.A new study shows that men spend three weeks of their lives waiting for their wives or girlfriends while the ladies are shopping. I'm sure a lot of men say it feels a lot longer than just three weeks. What do you say?GUILFOYLE: Well, I don't know. I mean, it sometimes a little bit creepy if you're in the dressing room, and there's all these guys standing right outside that are allegedly waiting for wives or girlfriends. And you're trying to -- well, that's a little funky.But I don't know. Do you really want to bring a guy with you to go shopping? I mean, I guess maybe if they're treating you.WILLIAMS: You mean your husband?GUILFOYLE: Well, I don't have a husband right now.WILLIAMS: Yes, yes, yes. But let me ask the men about this. Gregory, does your wife insist that you stay in there while she's shopping and trying on things?GUTFELD: Not at all, but when I go, I always try to make it interesting. I always, like, if I'm trying on clothes, I try to start a conversation with the person in the next dressing room.WILLIAMS: Is that right?GUTFELD: And sometimes I'll make -- you know, say, ""This is so hard to get in.""GUILFOYLE: With your foot tapping.GUTFELD: I'll leave -- sometimes I'll leave messages on the mirror with lipstick.WILLIAMS: Is that right?GUTFELD: Something creepy. I'll also try on really, really small articles of clothing, just to see if the salesperson will tell me it's too small; and then I will accuse them of calling me fat and try to work that into a discount.I would bring food into the dressing room and just eat a sandwich.WILLIAMS: So...GUILFOYLE: And then get a stain on it and ask for a discount.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: Statistics say women really care about price and if they get a deal. They spend a lot of their leisure time browsing. Men just want speed. We want to get in and out of the store. Would you agree?BOLLING: Look, the experience with Adrienne is we'll both on the -- if it's nice out, we're outside doing something active, right? But if it's not nice, she'll like go to the mall, and I'll go. I enjoy the mall on a rainy day or something.GUILFOYLE: Hot dog on a stick.BOLLING: And we'll split up for a while.GUILFOYLE: Lemonade.BOLLING: And I'll meet you back here in 45 minutes or an hour. And then we'll go around together. But I won't go into the stores. I'll usually stay outside and text or go on Twitter or something and just wait and kill some time. I look at some sports scores or whatever...WILLIAMS: Yes.BOLLING: ... and let her do her thing. But I'll go. It's actually a pleasant experience.WILLIAMS: So Dana, does Peter -- according to the stats, the No. 1 complaint is long lines for checkout. Do you just say to Peter, ""Stand in line. I'm just going to go and try this on""?PERINO: Definitely. Here's the thing. He's a great shopper.WILLIAMS: He's a great shopper.PERINO: And he's an enabler. Like if you find something and you're like, ""Oh, I like this,"" he'll say, ""Oh, you should get two."" I have to get them in two colors. He's an enabler.And I would say it's time well spent, right, because then I'm happy. He's happy. The other thing is this is going to go down, because online shopping...GUILFOYLE: That's true.PERINO: ... means that you're not going out to the stores anymore. You're just buying it there, and then they send it to you. You get the free shipping to return if it doesn't fit. And you don't have to go to the stores.WILLIAMS: They said -- you know, it's interesting. The researchers said woman care a lot that you're able to buy online but then...PERINO: Return it at the store.WILLIAMS: ... return it at brick-and-mortar.PERINO: And you know why the stores like that?WILLIAMS: Why?PERINO: Because if you return at the store, you're likely to buy One More Thing before you...GUTFELD: Hmm. ""One More Thing.""GUILFOYLE: I think it's more fun, you know, like with your girlfriends or you do how we shop. I go, ""Dana, where did you get those shoes?""PERINO: Who's got girlfriends? I don't have any girlfriends from college.GUILFOYLE: And she's like, ""Right here on Amazon."" And you send me the link and I buy them.GUTFELD: Shopping online after you have been drinking or taking an Ambien.PERINO: Bar none. Not the Ambien part.GUTFELD: No. You ever shop on Ambien?PERINO: No.GUTFELD: It's amazing.PERINO: Or maybe I ordered 32 toothpaste one time.GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: You ordered what?PERINO: OK. So we were traveling along, and I wanted the little toothpaste, because at TSA, you have to have it under 3.2 ounces. So I had the wine and I was looking -- or maybe it was Ambien. And I went on, and I went to get 3.2 ounce toothpaste, and I ordered toothpaste. And it arrived, and I had 32 tubes of it.WILLIAMS: Oh, my God.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: ... talking.WILLIAMS: So let me just tell you that the surprise, after all that we have just talked about, the big surprise is guess what? Men spend more on clothes annually than women these days.PERINO: I knew it.WILLIAMS: So men are doing more shopping.PERINO: I knew it.WILLIAMS: Anyway, ""One More Thing"" up next.GUILFOYLE: All right, Juan.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: All right. Time now for ""One More Thing."" Ms. Perino.PERINO: All right. It's book day for me. This is Amber Smith's new book. It's called ""Danger Close."" She is an amazing helicopter pilot. She flew the Kiawa Warrior helicopter, and this is a really amazing story.So she's friends with Katie Pavlich, and then I meet her later. And we realized she was actually flying the Kiawa Warrior helicopters that were the security for our flights that went into Bagram Air Force Base in December of 2008.So you never know when you'll have a small world experience. And I'm really honored to have a copy of this book. And Jasper, I think, he took a look at it this morning, too. He took a look. He couldn't get enough of it.GUILFOYLE: He's got a paw on it.PERINO: So congratulations to her. She's an accomplished women. And if you are a mom or dad and you want your daughter to read about this amazing epic journey that she had. It's a great book.GUILFOYLE: Fantastic. And we thank her for her service.PERINO: Absolutely.GUILFOYLE: Really inspirational. We love it, we love it.All right. Juan, what do you have for us today?WILLIAMS: Well, you know, I'm a romantic.GUTFELD: You are.WILLIAMS: I love love songs. Thank you, Gregory.GUILFOYLE: I like that about you.WILLIAMS: I love wedding pictures. Well, take a look at this one.GUILFOYLE: Me, too.WILLIAMS: It might be the best photo ever taken at Yosemite National Park in California. The photographer, Mike Karas did not know the couple -- you can see them there kissing and hugging. She's in a wedding dress; he's in a tuxedo.But with a picture this great, he shared the photo on the Internet, asking for help in finding the mystery couple. And finally, the newlyweds have been identified. Congratulations to Catherine Mack and Rick Donald, who came all the way from Australia to California to get married. Hopefully, the marriage will be as beautiful as this picture.GUTFELD: She left him for Cliff. [GUILFOYLE: I would be so afraid to be on the edge of that.All right. Eric, what do you have?BOLLING: OK. So the iPhone 7 came out today in California. They launched -- take a look. It's beautiful. It looks a lot like the 6. However, they have the upgraded operating system. There's also a second camera option on the plus, the bigger side.So price point stays the same, 649 bucks for the regular iPhone 7. But here's the interesting part. The ear buds that come with the iPhone...GUILFOYLE: Yes.BOLLING: The ones that plug in, you need an adapter to plug into your charger. Or, for an additional 159 bucks, that goes away, becomes wireless air pods. I think a lot of people are going to do that. Those things look really cool.GUTFELD: I would lose those.PERINO: I'm going to lose those in half a second.BOLLING: Yes, you know what? I think you eventually get used to having something in your pocket. But don't forget, Apple has become almost a phone company now. Something around 60 percent of their revenue comes from these phones. By the way, jet black. Color, jet black.GUILFOYLE: Did you get on the wait list, whatever? On the list?BOLLING: I'm going to get one. I'm ready for one.GUILFOYLE: OK, can you add my name?Greg.GUTFELD: Time for this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: ""Greg's Disgusting News.""(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: I just want to warn everybody, this is incredibly graphic, horrifying video.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(FOUR FLUFFY PUPPIES TURNING HEADS TO LISTEN TO MUSIC)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: This is the first moment that these puppies, these Alaskan malamutes, heard music for the first time in their lives. They had no idea what it was. I know, people are sick to their stomachs watching this right now. It's disgusting, just to see this. But look at this. It's going into their ears. They have no idea what's going on. So they just keep moving their heads.WILLIAMS: They look like us when Juan talks. We're like, ""Huh?""GUTFELD: That's when we hear the dog whistles.PERINO: Aww.GUILFOYLE: How cute, right?BOLLING: Good girls.WILLIAMS: What were they really doing?GUTFELD: They were listening to music.WILLIAMS: Seriously?GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: All right. My turn now. Call them myself.So this is a photo of a 5-year-old boy bowing his head, and this is really special, I think, especially in light of all the news recently. Outside of his school. It's very touching, and a lot of people love it, because the mother shared the story behind it.Heather Nelson said her son Royce was running late to kindergarten when she noticed him standing silently in front of the doors. The other children were rushing in to get inside and not be late. Well, he had apparently heard the Pledge of Allegiance starting and stopped in his tracks to recite it outside the stool and then followed up with a prayer. She said, ""I'm very proud of him to represent the two most amazing things: God and our country.""Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of ""The Five.""

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MARTHA MACCALLUM, GUEST HOST: Breaking tonight, disturbing displays coming to light on the campaign trail. New video emerging of children shouting expletives at Trump supporters and what happened then.Welcome everybody to ""The Kelly File"" tonight. I'm Martha MacCallum in for Megyn Kelly. And that is not our only big story this evening as we look ahead to tomorrow night's primary in Indiana. It is clear that this is a contest that's likely to reshape this race, it's just a matter of how it all turns out. We begin with a troubling and growing by product bill of this campaign as anti-Trump protests spreading across the country over the weekend. Last week it was California where police cruisers were smashed.  And Trump's supporters physically attacked but now some on the Left taking things to a new law as a group of children joined by some clearly consenting adults dropped the F-bomb on Trump supporters as they made their way to a rally in Fort Wayne, Indiana yesterday.Take a look at this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(BLEEP)(INAUDIBLE)(BLEEP)  (SHOUTING)(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Wow! Nomiki Konst, Bernie Sanders supporters joins us now.  Founder and executive director of the Accountability Project. And David Wohl is a Trump supporter and attorney. Welcome to you both.NOMIKI KONST, BERNIE SANDERS SUPPORTER: Thanks, Martha.DAVID WOHL, TRUMP SUPPORTER: Hi, Martha.MACCALLUM: Nomiki, can I start with you? What was your reaction?KONST: So, listen, I mean, when you have a presidential candidate who is throwing out hatred. He's saying to massive groups of separate movements and groups of people who don't have power. That they're not to be respected, they're not to be included in American Democratic process. When he's saying we should build a wall, when he's saying that all Mexicans are rapist and criminals, you're bound to get responses from all different spectrums. These are not professional activist, these aren't professional politicians, these are angry people and also not indicative of the entire movement.  I mean, there are thousands of peaceful protesters out there who are outraged of a presidential candidate. Somebody who is going to represent our country's interests internationally who wants to negotiate deals internationally is throwing out hateful rhetoric with his own people. And to people who want to come here for a better life. So, sure, these are -- these are a small group of people that do not reflect the overall rhetoric of the group of protesters.  MACCALLUM: All right. David, you're a Trump supporter. I would imagine that you heard some things that you felt were inaccurate what Nomiki just said. So, I'll let you address that. And also, this phenomenon that we're seeing on the street. And granted, this is a small group but it's disturbing and it tops on to something that I think on fall size, you have to say, what's going on?WOHL: Well, Martha, the reality is, any parent who is thinking about exploiting or endangering their child for political gain is those parents who were think again, it's a felony, it can result in jail time, it could result in your child being picked up by child protective services, it's a disastrously bad idea. Also Martha, on that political level, I mean, these are presumptively Hillary Clinton voters, supporters, the parents of these children.MACCALLUM: One of the kids has a Bernie t-shirt on and, you know, I mean, obviously they're not a supporting Donald Trump. That's a win out.WOHL: Well, they're going to vote. They're going to vote for the Democrat candidate who is going to be Hillary Clinton. And until she comes out and condemns this, condemns it completely and unequivocally, then she is going to own this type of behavior and she's going to pay for it down the road and it's going to be a cool, cool --KONST: Oh, come on!WOHL: -- summer for Hillary until she really comes -- and let people know this is unacceptable.MACCALLUM: Hold on. You know, when you were suggesting David that this is abusive to encourage their children as one person who appears to be a mom in this group. You were kind of snickering to that, Nomiki. And I don't understand that because when I look at these kids, I think, I feel sorry, it makes me sad. I mean, who teaches children to stand on the edge of this street and yelled the f-bomb at people as they're going by to go to a political rally. I mean, don't you think that, it's just wrong. Who does that?KONST: Well, it's not a felony. Let's make it -- I was snickering because -- David, you're a lawyer, that's not a felony and it's outrageous to say that.    WOHL: You know, how's a felony, if someone, one of those cars throw something at one of those kids, the person in the car gets prosecuted --(CROSSTALK)KONST: That's not what happened though. You have a responsibility --WOHL: -- and the parents who endangered the child gets prosecuted.KONST: Okay. Okay.WOHL: I've been doing this for 25 years. Believe me.MACCALLUM: Well, you know, I don't know if it is a felony but I can tell you that it's inappropriate. It's unethical.KONST: Sure.MACCALLUM: And to set-up kids and allow them to yell those kinds of words where they're holding pollsters that say, no hate.KONST: Yes.MACCALLUM: Are you kidding me?KONST: Sure. Responsible parenting --MACCALLUM: I mean, what kind of method is that?KONST: Absolutely responsible parenting. But let's not get distracted here. There's only one person running for president that has that type of rhetoric and it is that man right there, to the right of the screen who is Donald Trump and she has said much worse on a public stage nationally trying to rile up voters. He has said --(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)MACCALLUM: To suggest that it's -- coming to the country illegally?WOHL: I was at this rally on Thursday in Orange County, and I'm going to tell you something right now, my daughter, my nine-year-old daughter and I couldn't get out of the parking lot because these people who were in guise as a protesters were destroying everything in sight. We're saying we hate Donald Trump so we're going to destroy police cars, we're going to lay across the street. We're not going to let anyone out.KONST: I'm not condoning that, David.WOHL: This is not the new Left.KONST: I'm not condoning that.WOHL: This is not the new violent Left.KONST: Take responsibility for your candidate. Don't blame it on the Left, none of Bernie Sanders supporter --WOHL: So, you're blaming Donald Trump for that kind of behavior?KONST: -- we didn't coordinate with these people.WOHL: You're blaming Donald Trump for that kind of behavior?KONST: Well, I think Donald Trump saying -- hang on a second, David, when Donald Trump says that he is going to pay for the legal bills, for those in the audience who will go and attack the protesters, is the guy who wants to negotiate in Saudi Arabia?WOHL: When did he say that?MACCALLUM: He has said so many times that he does not -- hold on, guys.  Hold on! Stop shouting at each other -- that he doesn't condone violence at these rallies or outside these rallies. And I think that really both, you know, everyone needs to acknowledge that because there is a lot of heat around this situation.WOHL: Martha, we went to the rally on Thursday. The first thing that happened was a very loud recording that was played that said, if you see anyone creating trouble in this crowd of 30,000 people, do not touch them.  Shout out. Trump, Trump, Trump. And the security or the Secret Service will come and over and take care of them and they would be very polite about it.KONST: And now they say that. Now that they've been caught.(CROSSTALK)What about the punching protesters. What about the white extremists.WOHL: There was no violence inside the rally at all. None piece of violence.(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: Okay. I think you both made your points. Nomiki and David, thank you very much.KONST: Thank you.MACCALLUM: We're going to be talking about this with our next guest coming up as well. Thank you to you both. As we mentioned the clip of these children comes as leftist activists took to the streets in cities across the United States using Donald Trump seen here holding a KKK hood in Los Angeles in their protests against deportations, police shootings and capitalism.Trace Gallagher live with the report on this in our Westcoast Newsroom this evening. Hi, Trace.  TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Martha. There was a banner at the May Day protests here in LA that read, stand with immigrants, Black Lives, Muslims, LGBTQ and low wage workers, a pretty good indicator that those who showed up came to support a variety of causes. But they also largely share a common motivator Donald Trump. Some believe the giant balloon meant, effigy of Trump meant to symbolize that he was plastic and he has no heart. Others felt he was important to maintain the piece because they believe Trump is trying to stir up the violence. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. Trump is not going to change our community to be a hateful community full of violence. He's trying to do that. And he going to pit us against each other. We don't believe in that.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: That sentiment was not shared by demonstrators last week in Southern California. A Thursday protest outside of a campaign rally for Trump in Orange County led to the closing of streets, the pummeling of a police cruiser and at least one bloody confrontation. It took police and riot gears hours to regain the peace. At least 20 people were arrested, the next day in the San Francisco Bay area, hundreds of protesters tried to storm the doors of a hotel where Trump was set to address the state GOP convention. The protesters were held back, but the candidate himself was forced to pull off the freeway, jump a barrier and sneak in the back door.  But ramping up the violence outside is not toning down Trump's rhetoric inside. He is still taking a tough immigration stance and promising to build that boarder wall -- Martha.  MACCALLUM: All right. Trace, thanks.  Again this is hardly the first time as Trace's pointed out that we've seen these protesters go to extremes to get their message across. Last Thursday in California nearly 20 people were arrested, some five police cars were smashed as Trace mentioned, as one Trump supporter was bloodied during these so-called demonstrations leaving one writer to wonder how one would be covered if conservatives were doing the same thing at Clinton or Sanders rallies, what would that be like and how would that be covered? Which is always a fair question to ask in these situations.Marc Thiessen is a Fox News contributor and former chief speechwriter for President George W. Bush. Andell Brown is a civil rights attorney.Welcome to both of you, gentlemen. Good to have with us tonight.ANDELL BROWN, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Good to be with you, Martha.MACCALLUM: So, Andell, let me start with you. You know, if you were seeing this kind of thing, if you know, a Clinton supporter or a Bernie Sanders supporter was wearing a Bernie Sanders t-shirt and had blood pouring down his face because somebody bashed him in the face, how do you believe that that would be covered if it were, you know, conservative activists who were doing it?BROWN: We've seen protesters at both Sanders and Clinton rallies with the same type of violence that follows the Donald Trump rallies had not ensued.MACCALLUM: Right.BROWN: The common denominator is Trump and his supporters.MACCALLUM: My question is -- my question is you have to put the shoe on the other foot and you have to ask yourself is it fair -- is it fair to say that this kind of behavior is wrong, that it's, you know, un-American? I mean, protesting is absolutely the right thing to do if you want to exercise your right to freedom of speech. But, you know, this kind of distracted behavior is just not allowed.BROWN: When it comes to this article, which I read, I thought to myself, can I get some cracker and cheese to go with all this wine? I mean, I would expect the people on the right to come with a little bit more than calling these protests and demonstrations riots. I mean, we see more action on during spring break on South Beach. We have 52 arrests, that's more than all of these events combined.MACCALLUM: You're okay with police officers and police vehicles that have been smashed and you think that's perfectly, it's fine, nobody should be disturbed.  BROWN: I'm not saying it's fun, but let's not blow it out of proportion and call it a riot --  MACCALLUM: Okay. We're just calling it what it is. We named exactly how many arrests happened and what the distraction was and we're getting you guys to come on and, you know, discuss it.I'll bring in Marc Thiessen who I think believes that this was actually beneficial in some way to the Trump campaign, Marc. Explain.  MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it is beneficial to the Trump campaign, but first of all, you said that it was the common denominator was Trump protester protesters. That guy that we just saw jumping on a police car was not a Trump protesters. The people who are throwing rocks at motorists were not Trump supporters. So, this is not the Trump supporters there are doing. These are the smash mouth tactics of the radical left that are not protesting what Donald Trump said, they're protesting his right to speak. They're trying to stop him from speaking. They tried to go into the hotel and break through and the police stopped them to stop him from exercising his right to free speech.So, you do not see that happening on the right. You do not see Trump supporters going to Clinton and Sanders rallies and hurling rocks and throwing epithets and wearing sombreros and holding up their middle fingered people. This doesn't happen. It's helping Donald Trump because he couldn't have designed a better scene for himself to be his standing up against.  BROWN: Maybe they should --MACCALLUM: So, Andell, let me ask you one more time to put the shoe on the other foot. If this were happening at Sanders and Clinton rallies, right?  Would you be saying, you know, look at that's crazy right wing nut jobs who are running over this, you know, peaceful campaign.  BROWN: I don't recall Clinton or Sanders advising their supporters to knock the crap out of someone. I do recall Donald Trump doing that. And when you foster an atmosphere of violence and it follows, you can't be surprise. Everywhere he goes this violence follows and it's not happening on the other side.  MACCALLUM: All right. We have to leave it there. Do you want to have one last thought, Marc?  THIESSEN: The idea that Donald Trump is responsible for people coming in and throwing rocks is just absurd. They're coming in to his rallies, disrupting --BROWN: Common denominator --THIESSEN: -- him from speaking and so the people are responding to that and quite frankly the Trump protesters have been incredibly restrained because in the face of this violence they haven't done these things.  BROWN: Sure. Punching people in the face is incredibly restraint.(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: That incident must covered on this network and this show. Very clearly. Thank you, Gentlemen. We'll see where this goes. It's not a good trend out there. Thanks, Gentlemen.So we're just eight hours away now from the first polling opening in Indiana and Ted Cruz says that he will fight on even if he does not win tomorrow night in Indiana. Eric Trump here live on that.  Plus, an old rape case causing new headaches for the Republican front- runner after Mr. Trump spent the weekend promoting an endorsement for Mike Tyson. We're going to talk about this.Greg Garrison was the prosecutor in that case. He is here next.Plus, the White House was on defense today after the host of the Correspondents' Dinner went to an ugly place to get a laugh. We'll going to show you the fall out, you can decide. Coming up, next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LARRY WILMORE, COMEDIAN: Yo Barry, you did (bleep), did it.Thank you very much. Good night.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Developing tonight in the final hours to the critical Indiana primary, the Cruz campaign is trying to use a Trump endorsement against him. Mr. Trump made a point this weekend of promoting the fact that boxing great Mike Tyson is endorsing him. The problem is that Tyson was convicted of rape in Indiana back in 1992 and the Cruz campaign has been hitting Trump and Tyson repeatedly.Here is Trace Gallagher joining us once again tonight with the background and the details in this story. Trace.TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: As you recall Martha Mike Tyson served three years for raping a 17-year-old beauty pageant contestant who also taught Sunday school. At the time Donald Trump said Tyson was railroaded arguing that on the night of the rape, the victim was seen dancing with the big smile on her face, and willingly went to Mike Tyson's room. Now Trump has stirred up the controversy again by saying this.  Listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Mike Tyson endorsed me. I love it. He said out a tweet. Mike, you know, all the tough guys endorse me, I like that.  SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And Donald Trump says Mike Tyson is a tough guy. You know what John? I don't think rapists are tough guys. I think rapists are weak, they are bullies, and they're cowards.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Ted Cruz's VP picked Carly Fiorina added this, quoting, I think it says a lot about Donald Trump's campaign and his character that he is standing up and cheering for an endorsement by Mike Tyson. Outspoken Trump supporter Roger Stone responded saying, Fiorina's remarks show that she is a racist. Now, he did not explain why. And the man who prosecuted Mike Tyson Greg Garrison who is now a conservative talk radio host, also questioned the judgment of the Trump campaign saying, quoting here, ""In Indiana? Really? Did nobody in that while entourage of yours know that that snake raped a lovely kid in this town. I think I'd beef up my intelligence operation a little bit.""On ""Fox News Sunday,"" Trump appeared to put some distance between himself and Mike Tyson saying, he didn't have a meeting with him and that he hasn't seen Tyson in years -- Martha.  MACCALLUM: All right. Trace, thank you. So, here more on this and whether Mike Tyson and that issue will come up in the campaign, Trace just mentioned our next guest who is a radio host in Indiana, talk radio host and the prosecutor back in the early '90s that has successfully convicted Mike Tyson of rape. Greg Garrison joins us this evening. And also Charlie Hurt, political columnist at The Washington Times. Welcome, gentlemen.CHARLIE HURT, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, THE WASHINGTON TIMES: Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: Good to have you both here tonight.Greg, let me start with you.You know, just sticking with the politics of this, do you think that this issue given the polls and what you're seeing out there in Indiana, is it going to have any impact on this race tomorrow night?GREG GARRISON, HOST, GARRISON 93.1 WIBC: Well, one thing you have to remember is that was 24 years ago.MACCALLUM: Yes.GARRISON: So, yes, it's been a long time. There's been a lot of people going to vote in this election don't know who Tyson is and don't even know that this stuff happened. So, let's not, you know, let's not make it something it's not. It was a little bit of a ready, fire, aim moment for Mr. Trump who I just don't think was well advised. I suspect he'd like to have that one back. There's nothing about Mike Tyson that makes anybody want to celebrate his endorsement. That was a great kid. She was 17 years old. She was 5'6"" and 106 pounds. He tore her clothes off her and raped her and ruined her life.That's not the kind of thing -- I have no ax to grind with Mr. Trump. I think he's done some things for the Republican Party and for the politics that's important, but in this particular case to use a worn out old rapist like that and claim him to be a tough guy, that's silly. He went after woman, you know, and girls for that matter.  MACCALLUM: I understand what you're saying and we know that Mike Tyson did three years for that conviction. When you look at the politics of this Charlie, and you know, Greg may be right that the Trump campaign should have been more aware of the revelations of this issue in Indiana, what does it reveal perhaps about the campaign?  HURT: Well, Mr. Gary says exactly right about Mike Tyson and hats off to any prosecutor that puts a guy like that behind bars, but honestly, you know, to hear Ted Cruz try to gin this up into a big issue now, at this point in the campaign when polls show that he appears to be losing Indiana, when this endorsement came out, you know, six months ago back in October, where was the outrage then? You know, where was the outrage from Ted Cruz back when he was nuzzling up with Donald Trump and all of the early debates. The answer is, this is a political stunt. The Cruz campaign is using it as a political thing and this is exactly the kind of thing that voters are sick and tired of hearing from professional politicians, tactics like this as despicable as Mike Tyson is, as despicable as what he did is, it has nothing to do with what is wrong with this country and moreover, you know, those actions don't happen to be Donald Trump's fault.  MACCALLUM: Closing though. Mr. Garrison?GARRISON: Well, yes and no, it's an unforced error. Trump didn't need this and I suspected nobody -- knew that Tyson said anything six months or a year ago. I don't see it as being something huge. Whether or not it's being ginned up, you have to remember who brought it up. I mean, I'm not taking a side here, but Ted Cruz didn't talk about Mike Tyson. Donald Trump he brought it up --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: Yes. Well, you know what, at this stage of the game, you know, as irrelevant as it is as you point out Charlie in terms of what Indiana needs in the future from a president, we see this kind of stuff all the time in these final hours when, you know, one candidate is behind and they start to open themselves up to it, which I'm sure they probably have some second thoughts about now.Gentlemen, thank you. Good to see you both tonight.  HURT: Thanks, Martha.GARRISON: Thank you.MACCALLUM: So, as Indiana being called the state that could decide the future for the GOP race, Donald Trump's son Eric joins us next.Plus, the White House defends the host of their annual Correspondents' Dinner after his racially charged joke touched off a pretty big debate today, when we come back.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILMORE: Ben Carson was also against Harriet Tubman replace an Andrew Jackson in the $20 bill. He praised Jackson saying he was a tremendous president. From the grave Andrew Jackson replied what did (bleep) they're saying.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Breaking tonight, the final countdown is now on in the Hoosier State. And by this time tomorrow, we could know the big winner in Indiana, in all 57 delegates are up for grabs tomorrow night and right now it is Donald Trump leading with a nine point edge in a real clear politics average of polls. But parts of the state have been described as Cruz country. He's been working hard over the past few days.Our chief political correspondent campaign Carl Cameron is tracking the candidates and reporting tonight from South Bend, Indiana this evening.  CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Martha.  Donald Trump is wrapping up an event here in South Bend, Indiana. Indiana a state where Ted Cruz had said he must win. The Texas senator more than a month ago began pointing to this very red state as a place where he could halt Donald Trump's momentum. And today, as he has for about a week and a half campaigning in the Hoosier state, Cruz went after Trump with a whole series of characterizations saying that he is a bully, that he insults people, that he puts down people, that he belittles the disabled, that he's racist and a sexist, all of these things Cruz says are why Indiana should not vote for the front-runner. Listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: I trust the good people of Indiana to differentiate, we are not a country built on hatred. We are not a country built on anger, pettiness.  We are not a bitter, angry, petty, bigoted people, that is not American.  (END VIDEO CLIP)CAMERON: Trump today had a pretty big crowd here in South Bend, but he ran about 15 minutes late and during an earlier show tonight. I sort of downplayed the size of the crowd. And when he got here, he pointed out that there are overflow rooms that we don't see here and in fact that there are several more thousand than a particular reporter noted inaccurately a little bit ago.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Carl Cameron who is a nice guy, he said, no, they only have 1,500 people here.(CROWD BOOING)Let me tell you, let me tell you, start counting them up Carl because you have a lot of people here Carl.  (END VIDEO CLIP)CAMERON: Well, there you have it there, Martha. Fair and balance. Trump was right. There are probably about 8,000 people here spilled into two overflow rooms that frankly we didn't see because he was so late and didn't get a chance to see those people going in there. But we report, you decide and when the candidates are right, we give them their fair and balance -- Martha.MACCALLUM: I'm glad you got that straightened out. Carl, thank you very much. So, the fight between Trump and Cruz was captured in an unscripted moment when Senator Cruz confronted a Trump supporter on the street today and there was an interesting exchange that ensued. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: I want to thank you just for being here and exercising your First Amendment right.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Vote Trump.CRUZ: You are entitled to have that view and I'm going to treat you with respect even if not everyone in this process does. I'll tell you this election matters. It matters a lot...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah, it does matter. It matters a lot.(Crosstalk)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And then you asked Kasich to drop out and it's your turn. Take your own word. Time to drop out.CRUZ: Well, I'm sure sir, when Donald doesn't get to 1,237 are you going to call on him to drop out.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, he's definitely going to get to 1,237.CRUZ: No, no, Donald told the New York Times editorial board he's not going to build a wall and he's not going to deport anyone. He's lying.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Lying Ted.CRUZ: Well, sir, if I were Donald Trump, I wouldn't have come over and talked to you. I wouldn't have shown you that respect. In fact, you know what I would have done? I would have told the folks over there to go over and punch those guys in the face. That's what Donald Trump does to protester. I think a candidate is campaigning to work for you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're lying.CRUZ: Okay sir, I respect your right to speak, but I'm also going to say in America, we are a nation that is better than anger and insults and cursing and rage and I believe the people of Indiana have a common sense, good judgment that they want real solutions.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everybody vote Trump. Vote Trump.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: That was today on the campaign trail. Joining us now by David McIntosh, president of the Club for Growth. Its pack has endorsed Ted Cruz for president. Mr. McIntosh previously served as a congressman for the state of Indiana. Good evening, sir. Welcome to the program tonight.DAVID MCINTOSH, CLUB FOR GROWTH PRESIDENT: Great to be with you, Martha.MACCALLUM: So, what do you make of that back and forth there from your candidate.MCINTOSH: you know, I think Senator Cruz did a great job of holding his own being respecting the people that were clearly sent there to harass him, but he's right. Everybody has a right to raise their own opinion and what we don't need is a leader like Donald Trump who would send folks over or say, hey -- used to be that they would just get punched and maybe that's what we need. We don't need that kind of leadership in the White House right now.MACCALLUM: you know, just going back in a little bit in the history between, you know, how you chose your candidate Ted Cruz. You know, you guys have had a lot of back and forth and now that the focus is on your state in Indiana, some from the Trump camp might say you guys were never on the Trump side and in fact they go back to the time when you actually went to Trump's office and asked for $1 million for Club for Growth and were denied and after that started the Super PAC against him. So, that's sort of back in focus now that this is all turned to Indiana. You want to comment on that.MCINTOSH: Sure. One, let me say, I think Indiana will be a do or die state and very important probably decide who the nominee is.MACCALLUM: Right.MCINTOSH: Club has a long history way before that meeting of telling Donald we don't like your program of raising taxes. We're for free trade and you're not. And in fact, he asked me to send him a letter and say, well, we'll give you some money to help your other candidates and we said, well, if you're going to do it, we'll take that. But I now realize that was an effort to maybe buy our silence and we're not silent about his terrible record.He is opposing as a conservative. He has a long history of really supporting liberal democratic efforts and actually supporting Hillary and liberal Democrats. Hoosiers will be smart. They'll figure that out that Ted Cruz is the authentic conservative and we'll see that at the polls tomorrow.MACCALLUM: And if it doesn't go Ted Cruz's way tomorrow night, what would be your advice to him.MCINTOSH: My advice would be stay in there, anything could happen with Donald Trump and he'll have the second largest number of delegates. Keep fighting the fight and see what happens. But I think it would be a lot easier for him to be able to win the convention if we can have a victory tomorrow night in Indiana.MACCALLUM: All right, good to have you with us tonight. Thank you very much.MCINTOSH: My pleasure. Thank you.MACCALLUM: David McIntosh. So, joining us now as promised, Donald Trump's son, Eric Trump who is the executive vice president of development and acquisitions for the Trump Organization. Eric, welcome. Good to be here. You know, it goes back to this whole issue whether or not your dad is a true conservative and the Club for Growth has been, you know, sort of a nemesis back and forth in terms of that charge leveled against your dad. You remember that time.ERIC TRUMP, TRUMP ORGANIZATION VICE PRESIDENT: Very well, very well.MACCALLUM: So, talk to me about your recollection of that.E. TRUMP: Well, it's actually the obvious part. I listened to David speak, right. He came into my father's office. He asked for $1 million. My father goes, you know, I'm going to politely decline for now, and about a month later there's a Super PAC run by David spending all his time raising millions and millions of dollars to use on negative ads against my father and I think, you know, it really surprises me, right.A non-politician, as a family who's never been in politics, how ugly the business is. I mean, there's really extorsion. What they did is nothing short of extortion and it's sad and I think people are fed up with it.MACCALLUM: In terms of the accusations that have been, you know, leveled and you heard it from David and we talked about it earlier in the show -- when you look at the anger in some of these protests -- what your dad's opposition says is he started this basically, that he allowed things to happen or he encouraged people.He said, you know, I'll cover your expenses if anybody gets hurt or you know, back in the days somebody would have been carried out in a stretcher and they say that that's what started all this. What do you think?E. TRUMP: I'd like to say exactly the opposite. I think it is beautiful passion, right. You look at these rallies, you have 20,000 people show up, and they even calls you just said that, that they had 8,000 people at the rally that they're speaking at right now. I mean, it's love. It's passion. I mean you have a bunch of Bernie supporters who would come in and riot and you see that all the time and it's very sad.None of our protesters going over to Sanders or Clinton events. It's always their protesters coming over and disrupting our event. You know, it speaks for a lack of manners honestly in this country, and if I ever went to a, you know, a rally -- you know, somebody else's really and acted like that, I mean, my father would have killed me as a child. I mean, he just would have killed me. It really speaks to a lack of manners in the country.MACCALLUM: Talk to me about tomorrow night, about Indiana, about your perspective on how things are going to go there and if your father wins tomorrow night, if Donald Trump takes Indiana, what does he think should happen next and what would he do to try to bring people together.E. TRUMP: Well, we're going to win tomorrow night, there's no question about it. I mean, Ted Cruz has had an awful, awful, awful two weeks. He lost New York. We beat him by almost 50 percent. He got zero delegates in the state. We won Pennsylvania and Connecticut and Maryland and everywhere else and Delaware and Rhode Island. I mean, we won every congressional district of those five states and he just had a bad week.He did this little thing with Carly which backfired with them. He did this thing with Kasich which also backfired. I mean, both moves were very silly. It made him look very desperate and foolish. We're going to win tomorrow, there's no question about it. Even if we didn't win, quite frankly, we'd get well past the 1,237. We're going to win tomorrow and I think we're actually going to win every state between now and California.MACCALLUM: So then, if that's true, the big issue becomes a couple of groups, women primarily, where your father's unfavorable numbers are very high. He has said when asked about this question, he thinks Hillary's going to play the woman card and basically, you know, we're going to fix it. We're going to fix that problem. So how are you going to fix that problem when Hillary Clinton will clearly go after him on this?E. TRUMP: Listen, over the last couple of days, there have been polls that have been coming out where we're actually beating Hillary in the general election. You know, in a head to head matchup, we're beating Hillary. There was a poll that came out today -- there's a poll that came out two days ago where we're beating here.There's a poll that came out a couple of days before that where we're dead even. We're going to blow past her. But if you look at every state, in New York State alone, we got 59 percent of the women vote. Of the people who voted for us, 59 percent of them were women.MACCALLUM: And the legit (ph) people.E. TRUMP: If you look at Nevada and some other states, they would say you have the same problem with, you know, Latinos. Well, you know, in Nevada we blew out the Latino vote. We got that so, it always makes for an easy sound bite to say, hey, Trump's not going to get the Latinos.Trump's not going to get the African-American votes, Trump's not going to get the women votes, but we have time and time again, race after race and (inaudible) million votes ahead of Ted Cruz. We're 450 delegates ahead of Ted Cruz. We're doing amazing because people -- I think we're going to do great in the general.MACCALLUM: There's no doubt that you're doing very well in terms of the GOP nomination, but I think that the point is that when you get to the general election, the dynamic changes so dramatically. So what -- I'm just asking what the strategy is, you know. How do you -- what's the approach? How do you start to expand the pool? Do you go to Ted Cruz? I mean, is there patching up with Ted Cruz, somebody that you're dad has calling ""Lying Ted"" all along. I mean, we've seen him make some overtures towards Marco Rubio in some way. How do you patch those things up and is that what you're going to try to do.E.TRUMP: Well, the thing about Cruz is he's no longer concerned about the party. He's concerned about himself. He was telling John Kasich to pop out of the race, right, because he had no path to 1,237. Now, Ted Cruz has no path to 1,237, he doesn't want to go anywhere, right. And it sounds like he wants to be a little bit stubborn going, you know, going forward.If he loses tomorrow and he will lose tomorrow, he still wants to stay in the race. I mean, he's just effectively at this point, just being a spoiler. That's not good for the Republican Party. We should be out there. We should be going after Hillary and we should be doing everything we can to build the teams, build the GOP.MACCALLUM: I'm hearing no bridge coming any time soon with Ted Cruz.E. TRUMP: Listen, it's just sad. I mean, again, it's a politician putting himself before his party, his movement, and the people. You know, we should be behind one person and we should unify the party and we should get a jump on the democrats because that ultimately how we're going to win them come November.MACCALLUM: We'll talk more. Eric, thank you very much. Good to see you tonight.MACCALLUM: So, on the democratic side Hillary Clinton continuing to defend her handling of the e-mail scandal, but now for the first time, her husband has publicly spoken out about this issue. So, let's take a look at what he said and why Bill Clinton would be saying these words at this moment. Judge Napolitano here on that.Plus the White House now says that the president was cool with the racially charged remarks that came from comedian Larry Wilmore on Saturday night. Kevin Jackson and Mark Hannah, coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Developing tonight, the White House doing a bit of defense after the host of this weekend's correspondent's dinner went to calm the ugly place to get a laugh. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well Barry, you did a (bleep). You did it. Thank you very much. Good night.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Well, that was a big finish. Joining me now Kevin Jackson, conservative talk show host and Fox News contributor and Mark Hanna, a veteran of the Obama and Kerry presidential campaigns and author of the upcoming book, ""The Best Worst President"". Good to see both of you tonight.MARK HANNAH, WORKED ON OBAMA AND KERRY CAMPAIGNS: Hey Martha.MACCALLUM: So Mark, let me start with you. What was your reaction?HANNAH: Sure, I mean, it's tough for me to come out as kind of a guy who personifies whiteness and has like white privilege oozing out of my pores here. The debate with Kevin on whether this people should be taking offense at Larry Wilmore, but look, I've been to these White House correspondents's dinner. I went to one with George Bush as president, you got to have pretty thick skin to get there and this is late at night. There's some off color comments.Even Bill O'Reilly has come out and said tonight even that Larry Wilmore was coming from an affectionate place. That if you read this remarks in context, it's not that. What really ticks me off frankly is when people like black conservatives come on TV and say the black lives matter protestors are being too sensitive when they protest somebody who basically has been shot, an unarmed black kid has been shot but yet when a comedian uses a bad word, all of a sudden they're protesting. They think that they don't protest too much.MACCALLUM: I need to point out that the word that we used was the ""N"" word because we agreed (ph) to that.HANNAH: Yeah, that's right.MACCALLUM: And I just want to make it, you know, clear to everybody else that I know what we're talking about. But Kevin, you know, weigh in on this because, you know, I tell my kids never to use that word, right. So, then they see on the (inaudible) and they say, well, how come some people can use it and other people can't use it. It's funny when some people use it. It sends a very -- it's kind of a divisive message actually because it makes you feel like, you know, that there are different rules for different people and if you can get away with it, it's okay.KEVIN JACKSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it is divisive and to Mark's point about black lives matter, it's a fake movement that never should existed -- that never should exist because it's not based on any factual information. In fact it's the opposite but that's just to cover that little bit of a comment. But as far as this goes, it's very simple. Ask Mark two questions. One, what if a white comedian had done it and said exactly the same thing and the same thing and the same jokes, could he have gotten away with it? Absolutely not.HANNAH: Absolutely not.MACCALLUM: Right, absolutely not.JACKSON: Secondarily, not to be interrupted Mark, but secondarily, if a white comedian had said, hey, you're my cracker to George Bush as he was walking off as if to say, hey, we're the same people or something like that, he would have been excoriated for that as well.The fact of the matter is Larry Wilmore essentially knew that at all those correspondents, all these great supposed journalists could not say what he just said to the president and get away with it. This is essentially the wussification (ph) of America where if you say something that's politically incorrect, people will get fired over this. Paula Dean lost her career at one point.(Crosstalk)MACCALLUM: Just a second. Besides the fact that, you know, I think it's divisive in many ways. I agree in some ways he was trying to give the president a big compliment and then he finished it off with that sort of tasteless comment which was very unnecessary, but I think he was kind of -- he's having a tough time up there.People weren't really laughing that much and I think the president was sort of just trying to be gracious at the end and kind of make him feel better and not sort of wince when he used that phrase. That was my take on it, Mark.HANNAH: Well, it's possible. Look, Larry Wilmore is a skilled comedian but he had something going against him, which is he was following the president...MACCALLUM: Who was very funny...HANNAH: ...who was actually very funny. Even if you think that this is, you know, the horrible (ph) no-good, very worthy (ph), the blurriest (ph) president we've ever had, go Google after the show is over, the White House correspondent then watch the president's performance, it was pretty good.MACCALLUM: We have to leave it there guys.HANNAH: Thanks Martha.MACCALLUM: I like the host. I like, you know, like Don Rickles, Dean Martin, those guys are funny and they could do it without being rude and mean.(Crosstalk)HANNAH: I hope your kids were in bed by then. It was 11:00.MACCALLUM: Thanks you guys. Good to see you both. So, over the weekend Bill Clinton offered his first public defense of his wife's e-mail issues. Judge Napolitano, up next on that.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Developing tonight, new reaction after former president Bill Clinton offered what appeared to be his first public defense of Hillary's e-mail scandal. The FBI investigation into the former Secretary of State's use of a private e-mail server at her home is still under way, yet this is how the president addressed it, former president, this weekend.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL CLINTON, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: If you're driving in a 50 mile an hour zone and a police officer pulls you over when you're driving 40, says I'm sorry I got to give you a ticket because you know the speed limit here should be 35 and you should have known it. So everybody's all restless about this. Look, this is a game.MACCALLUM: The game, joining me now, Judge Andrew Napolitano, the Fox News senior judicial analyst and author of ""The Radical Expansion of Presidential Powers and the Lethal Threat to American Liberty."" I got it out. Hi, judge, how are you?ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Okay, Martha, how are you?MACCALLUM: Good to see you tonight. I'm good, thanks. I'm doing well. So, why now? Why is Bill Clinton speaking out about this now and why is he calling it a game?NAPOLITANO: You know, I'm shaking my head because he was the president. He was the chief law enforcement officer of the land and he knows how seriously these things can be. Here's why he said that on Saturday, because on Friday evening, the justice department filed a brief not in the case involving its investigation of Mrs. Clinton, but in a Freedom of Information of Act case, where a reporter asked for copies of correspondence between Mrs. Clinton and the State Department and Mrs. Clinton and the FBI, and the Justice Department said we can't give you these documents because they pertain to our investigation which is an active one involving law enforcement.This is the first time that the justice department has referred to the investigation of Mrs. Clinton as one that involves the enforcement and investigation of the enforcement of Federal law. It's important because Mrs. Clinton herself has said countless times, this doesn't involve me and it doesn't involve law enforcement, it involves classifying documents of whether they should be classified or not.MACCALLUM: She has repeatedly called it a...NAPOLITANOL: This directly challenges her view on this.MACCALLUM: She's repeatedly called this a security review that is not an investigation into her saying that there is no law enforcement investigation. So, it's clear that, you know, President Clinton -- these things just don't happen. He decided it was time for him to speak out about this. He wants to minimize it.He wants to make it appear to be no big deal. In terms of where this is going, is there any indication that it's going to wrap up any time soon because there was some suggestion it could go even beyond November, judge.NAPOLITANO: I think -- remember, there's two investigations.MACCALLUM: Right.NAPOLITANO: The investigation alleging public corruption. The allegation is that Mrs. Clinton made decisions as Secretary of State with foreign persons and foreign governments so they would contribute to the Clinton Foundation. That one may go beyond November. But I suggest to you that Bill Clinton knows from talking to his wife that the investigation of espionage, whether she removed state secrets from a secure location and put them into a nonsecure location is coming to an end.And they know it's coming to an end because the FBI has called in her closest circle of aides and they've already been interrogated by the FBI. There's one person left to be interrogated and that's Mrs. Clinton herself. And when she does go in to see the FBI or if she doesn't, all of this will become public and Bill Clinton is not only responding to what the justice department said on Friday, a law enforcement investigation, but he's trying to prepare the public for the end game here since we don't know how it's going to end.MACCALLUM: All right. Judge, thank you very much. Good to see you tonight. Judge Andrew Napolitano. Quick break here and we will be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: So it is May and it is primary season and tomorrow night it is Indiana folks -- 57 delegates up for grabs tomorrow evening. Our special coverage with Megyn Kelly and Bret Baier and Bill Hemmer and myself and a cast of others. Thanks for being here. We'll see you tomorrow night everybody. Have a good one.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: And this is a 'Fox News Alert.' Welcome to 'Hannity.' Tonight, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton participated in a presidential forum earlier tonight. Now, Clinton went first, where she was asked about her private e-mail server scandal and once again -- well, she came up with a new excuse, spinning the fact that the FBI found it held classified information. Now we got a new excuse. Let's take a look at it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-N.Y., PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Classified material has a header which says top secret, secret, confidential. Nothing -- and I will repeat this and this is verified in the report by the Department of Justice -- none of the e-mails sent or received by me had such a header.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: As for Donald Trump, he was asked about the military under President Obama's leadership, and used the opportunity to explain how he would take a much different approach than Hillary Clinton if, in fact, he becomes the commander-in-chief.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MATT LAUER, NBC: Have you lost faith in the military commanders?DONALD TRUMP , R, PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I have great faith in the military. I have great faith in certain of the commanders, certainly, but I have no faith in Hillary Clinton or the leadership. You look at what's happened. And you know, when she comes in and starts saying, Oh, I would have done this, I would have done -- she's been there for 30 years. I mean, we need change, Matt. We have to have it, and we have to have it fast.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Now, this comes as a brand-new NBC News poll shows that Donald Trump has a 19-point lead over Hillary Clinton among registered active duty military and veteran voters.Here with reaction, from the Trump Organization, Eric Trump, and Donald Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway. You know, I'm watching media coverage, everybody is getting it wrong. The moment of the night was this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I think that the decision to go to war in Iraq was a mistake. And I have said that my voting to give President Bush that authority was, from my perspective, my mistake. I also believe that it is imperative that we learn from the mistakes, like after-action reports are supposed to do. And so we must learn what led us down that path so that it never happens again.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: She voted for the war. She voted to pull out early. It created a vacuum for ISIS to emerge with the financial backing and the oil, that they got out of Iraq. Wow!OK, Kellyanne, if you are the mother of one of, what, up to 5,000 people that were killed, and here's a woman that wants to be president -- Oh, I made a mistake, but it's important that we learn from the mistake -- you have a dead child, you have a child that lost their limbs, have been disfigured as a result of her decision -- wow! I can't believe that's not front and center on every TV show tonight.KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: But that's not on her -- well, thanks for making it front and center on your show, and thanks for having the Trump campaign here.That's not what's on her mind. What's on her mind right now, Sean, is that she's on the verge of losing two consecutive presidential races because -- in part because of her vote on the war in Iraq. She lost the primary to Barack Obama in 2008, where he pounded her about the war in Iraq vote mercilessly. And now you've got Donald Trump being able to take the superior position to her on this. He's saying, I was against the Iraq war, and I said we should have taken the oil and gotten out of there -- before we got out of there. And so she doesn't have a lot of ground here.And by the way, it's not like it's just the Iraq war that's part of her secretary of state and U.S. Senate record. What about Libya? What about Syria? What about the Russian reset? What about Benghazi?And look, I think this election, Sean -- we're starting to see it's complex people and very simple ideas. You're either with the 70 percent of Americans who say, I want to go in a different direction, I want change in leadership, or you're not.(CROSSTALK)CONWAY: You either are with the 30 percent of America that thinks she tells the truth, or you're not. This is very simple.HANNITY: Thirty-seven percent of Americans -- 37 percent -- we're on the wrong track. I think this is key.Eric, I want to get to you and this forum tonight, and very specifically -- I made a mistake, 5,000 Americans died, many more injured, then created the vacuum for ISIS. And I know people are critical -- oh, your father was critical of some of the generals. Well, I don't think Obama's listening to the generals. That's a separate issue. But seriously, 5,000 people, Oops, I'm sorry, we've got to learn from it?ERIC TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S SON: We were sitting there with General Flynn tonight. It's amazing. I mean, the thing he said, and it was very, very clear -- we've been handcuffed. We've been totally handcuffed. We're not allowed to do our jobs. It's no different than the border control. They've been handcuffed. They can't do their jobs.And it's not just the lives -- and the lives are the most tragic thing in the entire world, it is so sad, thousands and thousands of lives -- it's also trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars.And I think my father's point is, what do we have to show for it at this point, Sean? I mean, what do we have to show for it? We have three, four, five different countries that are in total ruin. We have civil war. We have anarchy. We have ISIS. I mean, you can't flip on the TV anymore without seeing another ISIS attack either in our country or around the world.We have pandemonium in the Middle East. Her foreign policy destroyed the Middle East! It destabilized every single one of those nations and it's proven to be absolutely disastrous for our nation.HANNITY: And by the way, I haven't even got to the Iranian deal, and I thought her answer was pathetically weak because we're enabling the Iranians to spin their centrifuges with our money. They get to partner with Russia for missile defense. They get to build up their conventional arms.Then we've got Benghazi. Let's see, they denied 600 requests for security before. They denied help during because she was worried about what our military rescue team was going to wear! And they changed the uniforms four times!And then, of course, the lies afterwards. She told her daughter the truth, the Libyan president the truth. She told the Egyptian prime minister the truth, but she told us a lie. So to me, there's a lot of things that came out tonight.Now, we learned something new. We got a new excuse. First, of course, we heard the, Well, there was -- I neither sent nor received anything classified. I neither sent nor received anything marked classified. Now we got a new excuse tonight, anything marked with a header. The problem is, her own staff took away the header that marked it classified. And she's the only person in Washington that doesn't know that 'C' equals classified, especially if there's no A and B before the C, that can't be alphabetical.Now, I want to play James Comey responding to Trey Gowdy's question on how Hillary Clinton lied again and again about what the -- excuses she gave to you, the American people, on the use of this private server.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. TREY GOWDY, R, SOUTH CAROLINA: Secretary Clinton said there was nothing marked classified on her e-mails either sent or received. Was that true?JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR: That's not true. There were a small number of portion markings on, I think, three of the documents.GOWDY: Secretary Clinton said, I did not email any classified material to anyone on my e-mail. There is no classified material. Was that true?COMEY: There was classified material emailed.GOWDY: Secretary Clinton said she used just one device. Was that true?COMEY: She used multiple devices during the four years of her term as secretary of state.GOWDY: Secretary Clinton said all work related emails were returned to the State Department. Was that true?COMEY: No, we found work-related emails, thousands that were not returned.GOWDY: Secretary Clinton said her lawyers read every one of the emails and were overly inclusive. Did her lawyers read the email content individually?COMEY: No.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Wow! She lied! She lied repeatedly! He discovered that she lied! She lied about Benghazi repeatedly! And I'm listening to her tonight and then her saying what she did about, Oh, it was a mistake.CONWAY: Well, and the funny thing is, the ironic thing is, Sean, that Matt Lauer couldn't even get to all of Hillary Clinton's foreign policy failures because he had to spend the first 14 minutes -- and I credit him for this -- on her email server and then on her vote in Iraq.I mean, she was on defense from moment one, and she looked it. I don't think the Clinton campaign could be very happy with tonight's performance. I don't think it looks good for the upcoming debates. And that's not a loop that they're going to want to have rerun and rerun.And I would just remind everybody of one thing. Republicans in the past have been what I call hearing impaired when it comes to doing these hearings, and they don't do a very good job. This was masterful today by Trey Gowdy. Just lay out the...HANNITY: A couple weeks ago.CONWAY: Yes, it was a couple of weeks ago.HANNITY: It was masterful.CONWAY: And like, for Jim Comey, I want to remind people -- I want to remind people that he's under oath when he testifies in Congress.HANNITY: Why isn't she under oath?CONWAY: Well, she's not under oath when she's at a forum. He's not under oath when he gives a press conference. And I think that you're going to see that in an ads -- you're going to see that, what we saw tonight, in an ad this fall, I promise.HANNITY: Let me just remind -- and I'll get Eric's response to this because she gave multiple answers as it relates to the e-mail server scandal and it kept evolving. And tonight, we got a new explanation. Let's roll tape.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Laws and regulations in effect when I was secretary of state allowed me to use my e-mail for work. That is undisputed.It clearly wasn't the best choice, and I take responsibility for that decision.I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: iPhone or Android?(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: iPhone.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)CLINTON: OK, in full disclosure...UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Blackberry.CLINTON: And a Blackberry.I have a -- you know, an iPad, a mini-iPad, an iPhone and a Blackberry.I believe I have met all of my responsibilities, and the server will remain private.In order to be as cooperative as possible, we have turned over the server. They can do whatever they want to with the server to figure out what's there, what's not there.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Oh, but not only did they not clean the server with a cloth, as she glibly told our own Ed Henry, but they actually used BleachBit to make sure, as Trey Gowdy said, that God couldn't find those emails, some 33,000.When you look at the evolution, and yet a new excuse tonight, what are your thoughts?E. TRUMP: I'm a civilian and I just think the American people deserve a lot better than this. I mean, it's disgusting. You see that whole train . You see the lies. You see the deception. You see the lies to Congress. You see the lies to the Department of Justice, right? I mean, it's really disgusting.The American people deserve better than this, Sean. I think that's exactly why my father's running. You know, I mean, you see the corruption down in Washington. You see the amount of money that the Hillary Clinton -- you know, that the Clinton Foundation took in, the amount of money that they've profited off of government. American people...HANNITY: I've never seen anyone enrich themselves...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: What are your other takeaways here? Because on Libya, it got short shrift a little bit because before there were 600 requests. During, she was arguing about what our rescuers are wearing. And after were the lies.Then it's the Iranian deal. Then it's her answer on the VA. Well, VA corruption still exists today, and they weren't -- they're not waiting six days. I think your dad said six days. No, they've waited years. People died because they have two sets of lists, and bureaucrats got their bonuses based on creating the second list, which is corruption at the highest level at the expense of our brave men and women!CONWAY: The fundamental difference between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is this, and you can't get it in one-hour town hall forum tonight, Sean. It's that he's out there giving policy speeches every day. What did he do today? He went down to Philadelphia, went to the Union League and gave this military preparedness speech on the day that he also...HANNITY: Tonight...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: ... watched it.CONWAY: She didn't do that. So if you want to know what his full plan is as commander-in-chief, go read that speech. If you want to know what his plan is on middle class tax relief, on law enforcement, on communities of color, on defeating radical Islam and terrorists, on education tomorrow -- I mean, we're going to have ObamaCare coming up. In other words, at least you can see -- Veterans Reform Act, 10-point plan. She doesn't do this!HANNITY: The liberal media, I can tell already, is fixated on, Well, Donald Trump said that -- he's questioning the generals, saying he knows more about ISIS. What's your response to that?E. TRUMP: Oh, I think it's crazy. I think my father's exact point has been the generals have been handcuffed. And I said it...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: That's how I interpreted it, as well.E. TRUMP: ... has been handcuffed. And so have law enforcement across the country. And so have our border control across the country. You need to give them the tools that they need to succeed. They've been asking for the tools, and they've been denied those tools. We have amazing military. We have the best military in the world. We have the leaders there to beat ISIS. ISIS isn't -- I mean, ISIS is a force...HANNITY: But the key is, Obama, Kerry and Clinton don't listen to the generals!(CROSSTALK)CONWAY: That's right. And he mentioned all three of them, in fairness to him, and I hope people will play the full clip, Eric and Sean, because what Mr. Trump said was -- Matt Lauer said, Do you have a problem with the military (INAUDIBLE) No, I respect the military. It's President Obama's leadership that has to change.HANNITY: We're get into that and play it in full.CONWAY: I mean, he took on Kerry later on, too. And look, the polls are tightening. I think the Clinton folks are getting nervous. And why are the polls tightening? They call Donald Trump unfit and unpresidential. So you know what's happened? He shows that he's presidential. He goes to Mexico. He goes to Louisana.HANNITY: Mexico, Baton Rouge, Detroit...CONWAY: (INAUDIBLE)HANNITY: ... Philly today, yes.CONWAY: Yes. America -- what's her greatest liability? Her greatest liability is people think she lies for a living. What's happened to that? That's only gotten worse.HANNITY: Well said.CONWAY: (INAUDIBLE) mistake.HANNITY: All right, guys, good to see you both.CONWAY: Thank you.HANNITY: Thank you.And joining us now here with reaction, host of ""War Stories,"" Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North. Colonel North, I think you know a thing or two about radical Islamic terrorism and you know something about fighting a war -- 58,000 brave Americans. You fought in that war. You have multiple Purple Hearts that given you in that war.If you hear a presidential candidate glibly say, OH, I made a mistake sending you there and it's imperative we learn from the mistake -- if you're the father or mother of one of those dead soldiers, airmen, Marines, Navy men, as Obama would say, Navy 'corpseman,' my question to you is, I don't think I'd like that answer one bit. I'd be angry.OLIVER NORTH, ""WAR STORIES"" HOST: Well, I'm one of those, as is my brother, my next younger brother, who was sent to war by Lyndon Johnson, who made a terrible mistake and then didn't run again for reelection because of it. And Richard Nixon brought us home with the intention of winning the war.Now, look, the national security of this country and its strategy, its budget, its military end strength, its equipment buys, all of that, which were raised peripherally by Matt Lauer tonight, all have to be based on what I would call a cascade of risk, from the greatest risk to the least. And that requires we know our adversaries and the threats posed. Did anybody hear Mrs. Clinton talk about radical Islamic terror tonight? I didn't.HANNITY: I didn't hear that, either. I mean, she spent a lot of time having to explain herself on her email.NORTH: Exactly.HANNITY: Now, she says she can be trusted after corrupting national security and compromising it. I know of a case because I interviewed the mother, her son, who innocently sent classified information, will be spending two years in jail, one instance. One instance!NORTH: I would point out that I was indicted for altering, removing and destroying U.S. government classified documents, and therefore, aiding and abetting -- the actually charge was aiding and abetting the obstruction of Congress.Now, mercifully, I was exonerated. But at the end of the day, that's exactly what she did. I simply point out that there is a truly different standard for those of us who serve in the armed forces and most who serve in government and the treatment that Mrs. Clinton is being given by the Justice Department.HANNITY: What did you think -- and this didn't get enough play tonight, and I think it really should have, is -- I want to go back to Benghazi because, you know, at this point, 'What difference does it make?' was Hillary's answer, but I think what's really imperative here -- there were 600 separate individual requests for security before the incident happened.Remember, they were watching it in real time. The Brits had left. The Red Cross had left. The incident's happening, they're watching it, and she's negotiating with her team. She's the highest-ranking cabinet official at the table, and she's negotiating whether or not we need permission from Libya and what uniforms our brave men and women that are going to rescue them and risk their lives should be wearing!NORTH: Ever since...HANNITY: And then they lied afterwards!NORTH: Yes, ever since this terrible event, I've said the crimes that were committed before, during and after Benghazi are the things that really she ought to be held to account for. They did nothing to prepare for what always will be -- listen, it's just a few days away -- 9/11 will always be a terror target because it's a holiday for them. It's a great victory for them.HANNITY: Such a good point.NORTH: And so 9/11, no preparations were made. When it was happening, nothing was done about it. And afterwards, they had to lie to cover up their tracks.HANNITY: All right, Colonel, we got to let you go. Safe home, my friend. Always good to see you.NORTH: Appreciate you, buddy.HANNITY: And coming up, at tonight's forum, Trump and Clinton -- they both laid out their plans to defeat ISIS. When we come back, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, Lieutenant General Mike Flynn are here with reaction.Then later, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange -- he says the liberal American media is, quote, ""erecting a demon"" by protecting Hillary Clinton from scrutiny. We're going to have part two of my interview with Assange.That's coming up later as we continue tonight right here on 'Hannity.'(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back. Tonight, now, earlier, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump talked about the rise of ISIS at the commander-in-chief forum. Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)D. TRUMP: Part of the problem that we've had is we go in, we defeat somebody, and then we don't know what we're doing after that. I always said, Take the oil. One of the benefits we would have had if we took the oil is ISIS would not have been able to take oil and use that oil...LAUER: Let me stay on that...E. TRUMP: ... to fuel themselves.LAUER: Let me...D. TRUMP: If I win, I don't want to broadcast to the enemy exactly what my plan is.LAUER: But...CLINTON: We have to defeat ISIS. That is my highest counterterrorism goal. And we've got to do it with air power. We've got to do it with much more support for the Arabs and the Kurds. We are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again, and we're not putting ground troops into Syria.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Here with reaction, author of 'Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War,' Dr. Sebastian Gorka, as well as the author of 'The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies,' retired lieutenant general Michael Flynn.General Flynn, I think it's wise not to give details. You don't -- you don't telegraph what you're going to do, especially if you're fighting an enemy like ISIS. Obama and Hillary -- they told the world, Well, we're pulling out on this date. Good, we'll wait it out.GEN. MICHAEL FLYNN, U.S. ARMY (RET.), TRUMP ADVISER: And we have this many troops going in. Sean, we have got to stop being what I describe as the best enemies in the world! We continuously telegraph every single move we're going to make, whether we're going to take troops out of whether we're going to put troops in. I mean, we have to stop doing that.HANNITY: Were you at all offended -- because the liberal media, this is where they are going with this. They're going to ignore the fact that she made a mistake that resulted in 5,000-plus dead Americans and many others injured.But when he talked about the generals, my interpretation was -- and tell me if I'm wrong -- is that the generals have not been given the ability to do their job, and the only generals that stuck around were the people that would say yes. Is that true? Is that fair?(CROSSTALK)FLYNN: Donald Trump has enormous respect for our military. He has enormous respect for the leaders that we have in our military that are serving today. What he knows is that the decisions that have been made, the incredibly poor judgment on decisions to pull out of Iraq, that led to the rise of ISIS -- - I mean, we really haven't talked about Libya. The decision to go into Libya was almost solely placed on Hillary Clinton, and Libya is a disaster. It's a non-nation state now. So and ISIS and al Qaeda are running...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: I was just talking about that, I mean, 600 specific requests denied before it happened.FLYNN: Right.HANNITY: Literally while we're watching in real time!FLYNN: And you know what? She said something tonight, Sean? I'm sorry. She said something tonight that no one died in Libya, Four Americans died in Libya, to include...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: ... at this point, what difference does it make?FLYNN: Well, I just...HANNITY: I'm quoting her, obviously.FLYNN: I know you are. But these are -- this is about judgment. And what we saw tonight and what we've seen in the last couple of years -- I mean the last decade -- is just the incredibly poor judgment. And I was -- you know, I like to hear people talk about winning and how we're going to win.HANNITY: Dr. Gorka, that brings up a great point here because she's saying, We were wrong in Iraq. Sorry about all you people that died and all you people that lost your legs and limbs and bled on the battlefield to win Mosul, Ramadi, Fallujah, Tikrit, and Baghdad -- sorry! Oops! Mistake! Then they pull out. Then they create the vacuum for ISIS.But it's bigger than that. Then you got an Iranian deal, as we have discussed, that gives the mullahs, the number one state sponsor of terror all this money to spin their centrifuges and build nuclear weapons. Then you've got, of course, Libya, which the general is talking about.You know, at what point does she have to bear responsibility for all of these decisions being so destructive and so wrong?SEBASTIAN GORKA, 'DEFEATING JIHAD' AUTHOR: Sean, don't hold your breath on that one. It's not going to happen. This is the Teflon Don of national security. She's never going to take responsibility for the disastrous Iraqi policy, the Libya policy, the Syria policy.The general is absolutely right. It is a failure to have judgment. They're not interested in national security, Sean, they're interested in politics. Again, what are they doing? They're telegraphing our moves! I'm not...HANNITY: What about what Trump said, generals have been fired, reduced to rubble. In other words, how was your interpretation of that? Because mine is very different than what I'm hearing on other networks.GORKA: Look, the general knows better than anybody else. But as somebody who works very closely with military, in the last seven-and-a-half years, the general officer corps, the flag corps, has become very politicized. If you don't agree with the White House, you could find yourself in the kind of place that General Petraeus.HANNITY: Hasn't that happened?GORKA: Yes. Absolutely.HANNITY: General -- I think I know one right here.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Didn't that happen to you?FLYNN: Yes. I mean, you know, let's be very honest...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: ... story. You were a contrarian.FLYNN: Yes, very much so.HANNITY: And what happened?FLYNN: I mean, to me, you know, you're -- you're -- I'm sitting here today.(LAUGHTER)FLYNN: I'm sitting here today, so...(CROSSTALK)FLYNN: I'm stuck with you, Hannity.(CROSSTALK)FLYNN: But this is very serious. This is very serious because what Dr. Gorka is talking about, and I know -- I know inside of our military, there is great frustration. There is. I mean, you don't -- and the polls of how many of our military support Donald Trump is not a mistake. I mean, this is a big deal.HANNITY: Here's a tough question because you're on the inside. Is it true that our generals know that there's no hope of getting through to Obama and he's going to do what he damn well pleases anyway?FLYNN: Nothing is going to change. Nothing will change.HANNITY: And they know that. The generals know that.FLYNN: They know that. I mean, they know that. Nothing's going to change. You know, here's what I would tell you and I would tell the American public. There is no enemy that is unbeatable. I mean, we know how to beat these guys. We can beat these guys. And there's no ideology better than the American ideology, the American, you know, idea of our way of life.HANNITY: I want to pick that up when we get back because I think we've got to rethink. I know Donald Trump laid out a 10-point plan today. Don't we have to rethink how we approach war? We can't send kids in Humvees that even -- are not even up-armored, going door to door, when we should be building the technology, the new advanced method of warfare. And I think that's missing.We'll take a break. More with Dr. Gorka, Lieutenant General Flynn after the break.Then WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange broke news right here last night by revealing that he could release new documents about Hillary as soon as next week. We'll have part two of that interview and much more straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LAUER: Have you lost faith in the military commanders?E. TRUMP: I have great faith in the military. I have great faith in certain of the commanders, certainly, but I have no faith in Hillary Clinton or the leadership. You look at what's happened -- and you know, when she comes in and starts saying, Oh, I would have done this, I would have done -- she's been there for 30 years. I mean, we need change, Matt. We have to have it, and we have to have it fast.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: And he reiterated no faith in Obama or the generals working with Obama because he's not listening to them anyway.Here with us, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, retired lieutenant general Michael Flynn.I want to put emphasis on this. You disagreed with Obama. You were pushed aside. Is that true?FLYNN: Yes. I mean (INAUDIBLE)(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: ... kicked out.FLYNN: I mean, part of that is that it's this whole notion of the ideology, that radical Islamist ideology that we know -- and those of us in the intelligence community and those of us in the military know this is what we're facing.We've been fighting them. I've sat across these guys in interrogations. I know exactly what I'm talking about here.What Donald Trump said tonight is that he has enormous respect for those...HANNITY: He said that repeatedly, and that's being ignored by the media.(CROSSTALK)FLYNN: You know, the American public are not that dumb, Sean.HANNITY: So you -- this is very key to me, though. You had a contrarian view. You believe we can defeat ISIS. You have a plan. Dr. Gorka has a plan, but they wouldn't listen to you, and you're out!FLYNN: Yes. And I think that the other thing...(CROSSTALK)FLYNN: You know, part of the problem is, is that inside of the military right now, I know their hands are tied. I mean, it's like the border patrol that has come out and said we support Donald Trump --HANNITY: This is crucial.FLYNN: These are law enforcement and military professionals.HANNITY: Hands are tied.FLYNN: Their hands are tied.HANNITY: He's the commander in chief.FLYNN: We're talking about ISIS, an enemy that can be beaten. No enemy is unbeatable.HANNITY: Let me bring Dr. Gorka in. His story, if you don't mind me using you, General, here, is crucial to Trump's comments here. And it puts context and texture to the entire answer. And if his hands were tied and he's thrown out for being contrarian, that tells me Obama's not listening to anybody but his own arrogant, radical self. And that's where the problem comes in.GORKA: Sean, it's the echo chamber, OK. It's very important to listen to what happened to the general. The general was the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the highest ranking military intelligence professional in America, who was never invited to meet the commander in chief. This is the man who revolutionized our intelligence gathering in Afghanistan when General Flynn was responsible in Afghanistan for intelligence. You need to listen to what he's saying. The viewers need to understand when the general says is absolutely true. There is no enemy America cannot defeat. But we have to have a president who believes we are at war and wants to defeat our enemies.HANNITY: Dr. Gorka, I didn't hear Hillary challenged on why she can't utter the phrase ""radical Islam."" I think that's crucial. You have to fight them, right?GORKA: It was a dog and pony show, Sean. You have to look at the Philadelphia speech. Donald Trump's Philadelphia speech laid down the reality. The cops in the Army, the cops in the Navy --HANNITY: If Hillary is going to admit wars are politicized -- oops, it's a mistake, sorry your kid's dead, and we did the same thing in Vietnam. Does America need to invest strategically and tactically in the notion that we're not going to send kids door to door like we did in Iraq without up- armored Humvees getting their legs blown off or blown to smithereens? And is there a new way to fight wars without putting these kids on the ground, General?FLYNN: So, I would love to hear Sebastian Gorka's answer on this, too. The short answer, yes. The longer answer is we have to give the resources, the resources that our commanders need.HANNITY: And the sequester.FLYNN: And in terms of building up our military readiness. People should go and listen to what Donald Trump said today in Philadelphia.HANNITY: We're running out of time. Dr. Gorka, do we need strategic tactical shifts to ensure the safety of brave men and women when politicians are going to say, oops, sorry, your kid's dead, I made a mistake?GORKA: Re-field the fight by the general. Check out my book 'Defeating Jihad.' But most important of all, the rules of engagement have to be changed. Our guys are handicapped right now.HANNITY: All right, guys, thank you all for being with us. General, good to see you. Dr. Gorka, thank you.Coming up, part two of my interview with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Last night he revealed that he may release more documents pertaining to Hillary Clinton as early as next week. I asked him how significant that material is. He'll give us that answer next.And then later, we'll have more reaction to tonight's commander in chief forum. We'll check in with A.J. Delgado, Lisa Boothe as we continue tonight here on HANNITY.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to 'HANNITY.' So last night WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange made news on this program when he announced that he'd reveal and release several batches of documents related to Hillary Clinton possibly as early as next week. Here's part two of my interview with him.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: Let me go to the Hillary issue for a second. You did liken her to a demon, which I found amusing, but then you went on to say 'the American liberal press is falling all over themselves to defend Hillary Clinton, erecting a demon that is going to put nooses around everyone's neck as soon as she wins the election, which is almost certainly what she's going to do,' meaning if she wins. I don't think anyone can accurately predict right now which way this election is going to go. That's my own personal opinion. What did you mean by that?JULIAN ASSANGE, FOUNDER, WIKILEAKS: Well, it's a bit taken out of context by critics like 'The New York Times.' I wasn't talking Hillary Clinton as a person but rather the climate that they are erecting. It is a demon, that climate, if Hillary Clinton is elected.And they have legitimized a climate of calling opposition leaders Russian agents, calling critical press Russian agents. Her campaign team has done it both to Mr. Trump, to us, for the Green's candidate, Jill Stein, and another small publisher in the United States. They are legitimizing that climate. When ""The New York Times,"" a kind of standard bearer of the liberal press, says that's an OK thing to do for a ruling party candidate, to come out and say that the opposition leaders and the press are foreign agents in order to turn around a domestic scandal, that's a really serious problem.HANNITY: You know, I give you more credit than those in the liberal press. I'm a commentator. I am a talk show host. I openly tell this audience I have strong conservative opinions. But I would expect objective journalists to be doing a lot of what you're doing. And you're right, I think they are unwilling to do that because they've got a political agenda in play.You have talked at length about other information that you have that you'll be releasing to the American public prior to the election in November. Can you give us any insight about that information? Do you think it will have a dramatic impact on the electoral results?ASSANGE: I don't know about electoral results. I'm quite cynical about politics, or skeptical about politics, as I'm sure you probably are as well, Sean. Things can happen in interesting way. I do think the material that we have that we're working on around the clock is significant, and it's up to people to look at it and run with it.Now, I'm sure Fox News will run with some of that, but in the DNC leak, yes, we saw the resignation of five of the top DNC officials, including the president. But did 'The New York Times' run with it? No. Did MSNBC run with it? No. In fact, MSNBC, 'Politico,' and NBC were exposed as conspiring with the DNC to subvert Bernie Sanders' campaign.But people in the United States came to our website, some journalists also came, and it was the public that really took it up and pushed it. So I hope that will happen again.HANNITY: You said you were going to release more information before the election in November 8th. If you had to maybe rate it on a scale of one to 10, 10 being most significant, how significant is it?ASSANGE: Well, it's not just one type of piece of information. We have thousands and thousands of records. So it's, you know, each hundred records gives you a story. So you have to kind of understand each story, and that is a lot of work to format it, to verify it, to put it in particular batches to be released. WikiLeaks is tax deductible in the United States, if people want to buy and help us do that. We're a small outfit that has been attacked by the Obama administration for six years now in an investigation that's been condemned by Human Rights Watch, by the U.N., by even by the ACLU.HANNITY: You have said that if you had information on any candidate you feel the public has a right to know. Do you have any information, any batches, if you will, on Donald Trump?ASSANGE: We have information which touches on the Republican Party's campaign. In assessing that information, we will publish it, of course. But Donald Trump is -- he makes very controversial statements. He doesn't have a history of being in government.HANNITY: He doesn't use e-mail, you know that, right? He doesn't use e- mail personally.ASSANGE: I'm sorry?HANNITY: Donald Trump does not use e-mail personally.ASSANGE: Right, probably a wise choice.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: Let me ask you one last question on the morals and ethics of this. I actually do applaud -- you've exposed a lot about our government that I am appreciative of as a citizen, because I think there have been things that have been going on that we need to know about, and I hope it wakes people up. What do you -- where do you draw a line in terms of the right to citizens, private citizens, or, you know, people even in the public to have privacy?ASSANGE: Well, look, we publish information from political parties and governments. We're not interested in information from private individuals unless they are billionaires or trying to manipulate or drive the political system in some way. So people don't need to worry about WikiLeaks' being interested in that.Before these big, corrupt organizations, you know, dodgy politicians and so on, we just say what they say. If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear. What's their problem in the public knowing the truth? Because that's all we publish. There's no allegation that we haven't been completely accurate.HANNITY: That's 100 percent true. Somebody like George Soros would be on your radar. He's trying to influence elections. He's trying to impact the political process.ASSANGE: We will be publishing quite a lot of information about George Soros. It has been published elsewhere, but in a very unusable form. That's part of what we do, as well, is take records that are extremely hard to use, like some of the State Department records. We create this wonderful library of how modern institutions actually behave across the world in the United States and other countries, as well, published 650,000 documents on Russia, most of them critical, 2.3 million of Bashar al Assad and Syria, even including his personal emails.(END VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: And coming up, we have more reaction to tonight's commander in chief forum. We'll check in with A.J. Delgado, Lisa Boothe. They're here next as we continue. Glad you're with us on HANNITY.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to HANNITY. Here with more reaction to tonight's commander in chief forum, 'Washington Examiner,' contributor Lisa Boothe, Trump campaign senior adviser, our friend A.J. Delgado. What are the headlines from tonight's event from your perspective, not the liberal media perspective?A.J. DELGADO, TRUMP CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER: I thought it was an amazingly poor performance from Hillary Clinton, a surprisingly bad one, which is kind of has me wondering now how she'll perform in a debate. She faltered badly under pressure, Sean. She honestly seemed as though she was going to have some sort of emotional breakdown when he started questioning her about the emails. She knows she's lying. She knows she has been caught lying. She knows she broke the law.HANNITY: She extended the lie tonight. We got a new answer, we got a new lie tonight.DELGADO: When do we not? They come in every day.HANNITY: I could play Trey Gowdy again and again. But Trey Gowdy interviewing Comey, 'No, that's a lie. No, that's a lie. No, that's a lie.' It was pretty profound, right?LISA BOOTHE, 'WASHINGTON EXAMINER' CONTRIBUTOR: We've heard a million different iterations of the classified information. I didn't send classified information. OK, I sent classified information but I didn't really know what the ""c"" meant. I thought it meant it was alphabetized. But, I mean, come on. Hillary Clinton, I believe Donald Trump is right when he says Hillary Clinton has disqualified herself from being commander in chief. The reality is, let's look at the women's actions. She reportedly spent $140,000 out of her own pocket to set up a private e-mail server, deleted tens of thousands of e-mails using BleachBit.HANNITY: BleachBit, my favorite part, because Ed Henry goes, 'Did you wipe the server clean?' 'Like, with, like, a cloth, Ed?' They are using BleachBit. Jesus can't find it. That's what BleachBit is for.BOOTHE: Not even that.HANNITY: You're an attorney and went to Harvard Law, correct? Isn't that intent, criminal intention?DELGADO: They had a subpoena and destroyed evidence. It doesn't get clearer than that. And Sean, I have a homework assignment for everybody. Go Google.HANNITY: I don't like to do homework.DELGADO: It's an easy one. Go Google the name Bryan, I want to make sure I get it right, Bryan Nishimura. Bryan Nishimura was a Naval reservists who pretty much did what Hillary Clinton did. He was fined and he can no longer have security clearance.HANNITY: Julian Assange is on my radio show for an hour tomorrow, but I'm also interviewing a guy going off to jail because he sent out classified material one time, once, two years ago.DELGADO: She should be in a trial room right now, in a courtroom, not running for president. She's not just unqualified. She's disqualified.BOOTHE: And it's also the fact of other information that we learned from the FBI putting out some of those documents, the document dump prior to Labor Day is the fact that her aides quite literally smashed phones with hammers.HANNITY: By the way, it was multiples devices. There were 13 devices.(CROSSTALK)BOOTHE: She said she used one for convenience.HANNITY: Thirteen.BOOTHE: There is no question anymore if she was hiding something. You don't take those actions if you aren't trying to hide something.HANNITY: A.J., I have 13 more in the green room. You can bust that up with a hammer. It's my iPhone.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Just hammer away.DELGADO: That is not weird at all.HANNITY: Beat the crap out of it and erase it for me.DELGADO: Very presidential.HANNITY: Do you have BleachBit? Anybody?DELGADO: It's very expensive. I've never had the money.BOOTHE: I never tried to hide something to that degree. Sorry.HANNITY: Why can't you just, if it's about yoga, a wedding and a funeral, why not delete it like everybody else?DELGADO: Or hand them all over like she said she did?(CROSSTALK)BOOTHE: We know that she had lied because she said that she turned over her work related e-mails. That is not the case.HANNITY: We've got to break. When we come back, we need your help, a very important question of the day.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And time for our 'Question of the Day.' In the wake of tonight's presidential forum, who do you think would make a better commander in chief? It's a simple question. We want to hear from you. Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you think.That is all the time we have left. We have a busy show coming back here tomorrow night. We hope you'll join us.
