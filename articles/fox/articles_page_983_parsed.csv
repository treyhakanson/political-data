This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: Republican Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt is not smiling. In fact, he is suing.Over what, General? What specifically?SCOTT PRUITT, R - OK, ATTORNEY GENERAL: Well, good afternoon, Neil.I think what we are -- are focused upon is this executive amnesty, the executive branch doing that which only the legislative branch can do. The president has said, pass a bill. But the legislative prerogative is to pass a bill or not pass a bill. And because Congress has not acted, it doesn`t give him license to fill in the void.And so, with this executive action, it has put the states in a very adversarial position. We have triggered state benefits now because these folks are lawfully present in the state of Oklahoma. And so state Medicaid, state welfare benefits are going to be paid . This is injuring the state and injuring states all over the country because of the unlawful action of the president.CAVUTO: So, that`s really the -- the backbone of this suit, right, in other words, that it`s costing your state, as it is a lot of cities and municipalities directly affected by this freeze in deportations for some five million illegals. It`s a big, costly issue, not a political one, just a costly one.PRUITT: That`s right exactly right.And these -- these individuals are subject to deportation today. And the president has suspended their deportation. They`re here unlawfully. He has taken action to replace what Congress would do otherwise. And so he has pointed to prosecutorial discretion, Neil. As attorney general, I utilized prosecutorial discretion every day, and that`s only done on a case-by-case basis.When you`re talking about four million-plus individuals, it`s impossible for the federal government to be able to engage in a case-by-case review of those four million individuals in the way that would characterize prosecutorial discretion.The president is taking too much license here. He`s acting only because in his estimation Congress has not, and that doesn`t give him that authority, and so he has acted in an unlawful way.CAVUTO: All right.Now, you`re a man of the law. And you`re not trying to play politics with this. But are worried that you`re being sort of sucker-punched by the administration and by Democrats in general, who love this talk of being sued and who love this talk of being dragged to court and love this talk -- and it`s extreme -- of even threatening to impeach the president?That`s not you, Attorney General, but there are many Republicans who are advocating that. And that it gets people`s attention off the issue at hand, which is a good legal one in your case, and then it makes it look like Republicans are anti-Latino, obstructionists. You've heard it all.PRUITT: Well, we should care, Neil, that the process does matter.There are -- there are ideas that the president has put forth in his executive action that may be good ideas. There may be some ideas that are not so good. But that`s why the process matters. And we have something called rule of law in this country. The president himself, when he was running for president, recognized that he was constrained by the law and couldn`t just take executive action like he described last week.So...CAVUTO: But what do you do -- what do you make of his argument, sir, that I tried work with Republicans for six years now to come up with a coherent immigration policy, they dropped the ball? Republicans counter they had plenty of options out there and plenty of options they were pursuing with the White House, including tougher border enforcement, and that`s where the line was drawn and the division started.But having said that, he is going to come back at you and say, I would have been happy if they had given me a bill. I would have been happy to pursue that. They never did. So there I stand on my sound legal ground. You say what?PRUITT: Well, when -- if he -- if he believes so strongly that he had this legal authority to act, and it`s such a compelling issue, my question would be, why did he wait until after the election to do so? Why didn`t he act six months ago? Why didn`t he act two years ago?The fact of the matter is, he acted post an election and before the next Congress comes in. I think, if anything, that`s brazenly political. At the end of the day, we have something that constrains even the president. It`s called the Constitution. And the U.S. Congress is the body that is responsible for passing laws.It takes two branches to pass a law, not just one, and the president can`t act just because the Congress has failed to.CAVUTO: All right.Attorney General, we will watch very, very closely. Thank you, sir, very much.PRUITT: Thank you. Thank you, Neil.Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2014 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

"This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" January 7, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle, along with Juan Williams, Eric Bolling, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5 o'clock in New York City and this is The Five.In a week one of 2016, the chaos in the Middle East has dramatically spiraled. Two powers in the region, Saudi Arabia and Iran are now in a diplomatic standoff. In Afghanistan, the Taliban has waged new attacks against our troops, killing one on Tuesday and injuring two others. And as ISIS maintains its grip in Syria and Iraq, a frightening new video has emerged of weapons experts training terrorists. Former Defense Intelligence Agency chief, Mike Flynn, thinks chaos has emerged as a result of President Obama's retreat from leadership. He says enormous challenges lie ahead for our next leader.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LT. GEN. MICHAEL FLYNN, FORMER DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY DIRECTOR: The importance of this next national election is huge, because whoever is the president of the United States is going to deal with an absolute mess on their hands and it's going to last for a long time potentially, their entire presidency. Whenever there's a void of U.S. leadership, it will be filled and it will be filled by dictators, by terrorists, by those threats that we face.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: You just heard General Flynn say how important this election is to fight overseas. So what do the candidates make of the conflicts?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When I'm president we're going to have a real war on terror. Not a rhetorical war, a real one. Which means this -- the best intelligence agencies in the world are going to tell us where they are and what they're doing. The most capable military force in the world is going to destroy them.DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You look at what's going on in the world. We're the policemen of the world. We owe $19 trillion. We just made a ridiculous budget, you know, the omnibus that just got approved. The only thing Obama negotiates well with frankly, are the republicans. He always seems to come out on top with the republicans. Iran beats him, everybody beats him. We're the laughing stock all over the world.GOV. JOHN KASICH, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: With Iran and Saudi Arabia keep our nose out of it. The difference between Shia and Sunni, those (inaudible) fighting has been going on since about the 6th century. And the last thing we need to do is to get in the middle of it.(END VIDEO CLIPS)GUILFOYLE: So the question remains is the Middle East on the brink. With all the swirling conflict, growing tensions in the area, it is definitely a national security quagmire to say the least where a leadership is needed to be heard, Flynn saying that this is because of a vacuum of President Obama. Do you think the candidates are sending the right message and tone to contrast with the president?ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: I do. I think they're smart, they're on it, they realize, especially Kasich realizes that this is one you really -- Saudi Arabia versus Iran, you probably don't want to get too involved in this. This is Sunni/Shia conflict that you could basically do that and many of the various countries throughout the Middle East. If you start picking and choosing sides on those lines, you need a road map to figure out who was your friend and who was your foe. I think you have to let that play itself out. This is ugly, though. This Iran/Saudi Arabia thing --GUILFOYLE: Very bad.BOLLING: Saudis allegedly dropped bombs on their -- on an embassy in -- within Iran. This is unbelievably explosive. It had -- has implications for Americans. It had -- has implications for global economies. Oil prices could skyrocket on something like this. They didn't, but they could. I think the smartest thing to do is to kind of pull yourself out. The question is, for John Kasich, who I agree with, stay out of that. What happens to the other ones then? Do you pull yourselves out of the other ones? Why is a Syrian civil war something we need to be involved in?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Boy, you surprised me.BOLLING: Why?WILLIAMS: I never thought that you would say something --BOLLING: You have -- had you been here for the last two years?WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah, but I mean, I'm -- I tend to agree with you. That's just surprising.GUILFOYLE: Because if you agree, we'll skip you now.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: That counts for two. Dana, what's the messaging here? What do you think is going on in the White House, in terms of how they're handling this? What kind of diplomacy or engagement/involvement should we be doing?DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: I think it's analysis by paralysis, right? So that's a General Michael Flynn was saying. It's one of the reasons that he resigned. We already chose sides with Iran, OK? We gave them the store when we gave them their nuclear agreement. And so, that was why the Saudis have felt like we have not been living up to our agreement to provide for their security. They don't trust our judgment. So they went ahead and they did the execution that irritated Iran, to be -- do a great extent, so they're already picking sides.But Eric, when you say, like for example, I agree with you. Like this could have major consequences for us. So then the question is, and do you just pull out all together and let them fight it out? But if it has consequences for us, do we have a role to play?GUILFOYLE: Should we take it.PERINO: And what role would that be? And I think of the thing that's very frustrating for the White House is that they were counting on, both Iran and Saudi to be at the table to try to deal with this ISIS talks, so to speak, like to try to figure out some sort of agreement. But now, if you had -- the Saudis helping -- basically represent the rebels, and Iran basically representing Syria with Russia's help, then they were all supposed to come to the table. Now, nobody's at the table. So the one small hope that the administration had of being able to say we're trying to get a handle on ISIS is now evaporated. So then the question is, so what is the president's strategy, and what is he willing to change, if anything. And it probably doesn't help in an election year, that you have candidates who are not giving fulsome responses, they're giving sound bites here and there. They are weighing in and chipping at the president's strategy or lack thereof. And it makes it more difficult even for a president to actually be able to go ahead and either admit that they need to change courses mid- stream or to basically sit back and wait and then bequeath to his successor, a huge mess like General Flynn was talking about.BOLLING: Can I just very, throw this in very quickly? The only one of the issues here, and I would agree with the administration on this is how do you back the Saudis for hanging 47 people in a day?PERINO: You don't. And that's why -- you don't. And that's why it's always been extremely tricky. It's never been a black-and-white issue. It's extremely tricky with everybody.GUILFOYLE: But that's how they deal with stuff that we know.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: We attack the president for leading from behind. But then when we say we're not going to be there, I mean that's a decision and that's a foreign policy and some people do support it, but there are consequences to that, too, and we can't pretend that doesn't have an effect on American soil at some point, if we are concerned about ISIS proliferating in the region, which is my original point. And I'm taking so much of the time.GUILFOYLE: So Greg, if you have a Rubik's cube, really.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: How are you going to shape-shift this into something --to a solution?GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Well.GUILFOYLE: Solve it.GUTFELD: We always begin the segments with that the Middle East is on the brink. As if there's nothing else but the brink. There's no other area. They should rename it, the brink. That entire part of the country should be called the brink, because it's been the brink for four decades. It's where we change the name to earth's bursitis, because it is a chronic pain that you're stuck with forever. And the fact is, you only, the only time you step in at this point is when it becomes your problem.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: And I think we -- Syria, we should have stepped in because it's our problem now. It is Europe's problem, what we're seeing right now is a migrant -- a chaotic migrant nightmare, because.WILLIAMS: Right.GUTFELD: We didn't want to do any granted, the choices weren't great. We had no choices. But right now, we're in a scenario, it violates the Middle East crisis rule. Generally, there should only be two hot spots, you know? But now there are four. That's kind of like, you know when, you only wake up in the morning with one big zit. The earth has four of them in the same place and you can't pop them all.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: It is a -- I would go do a dermatologist.GUILFOYLE: It's like --GUTFELD: If I saw four big blackheads.GUILFOYLE: Oh my, gosh.GUTFELD: I would go to the doctor.PERINO: You have a lot of personal problems. You've got bursitis, you've got like acne, what else, gout?GUTFELD: They're the crazy couple that lives in apartment 12-C that you avoided at all costs until the drunk guy, you know, punches your son or the crazy lady insults your wife. That's the Middle East. It is the crazy couple and you only step in until the crazy couple steps in your life.WILLIAMS: Well, I just think it's terrific that this table, as I famously saying.GUTFELD: That this table.GUILFOYLE: At this table.WILLIAMS: Is not echoing General Flynn, in terms of General Flynn saying, oh gosh, you know there's a big strategic football game going on and we're not even in the stakes.GUILFOYLE: I'm echoing.PERINO: I didn't say that.WILLIAMS: No, I don't think you said that. I think that what you said is.GUILFOYLE: Oh, playback.WILLIAMS: That we have difficult choices to make here. And if you look back over the history of this situation, you have several administrations. I think back to Bill Clinton's administration, forward to the Bush. Lots of people have made difficult choices in this area. And right now, we have to look.GUTFELD: That's why you're a president.WILLIAMS: Right. And I think that right now, we, as Americans have to come together and not, which is I saw some of that from the candidates, get in the blame game in terms of pointing fingers.PERINO: Well, that's just going --WILLIAMS: At Obama.PERINO: That's just going to -- that is going to happen for sure.WILLIAMS: But I don't think --PERINO: There's a whole election year, it happened in 2008. It happened in 2004, I mean, that just happens in election years.WILLIAMS: OK.PERINO: So we have to accept that. I think it's given.WILLIAMS: I don't think it's good. I don't -- I think, given that there is a deal in place right now with Iran, that there has to be a sense of, you know what, we have to now do what Hillary Clinton said, which is, you know, distrust and verify. You have to be --PERINO: So then why did, why did the administration back off on doing the sanctions against Iran last week?GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: Because they want it.PERINO: They had --WILLIAMS: they understood what was going on.PERINO: No. Because Juan -- no, Juan, they had briefed Capitol Hill. They had --WILLIAMS: Yes, they --PERINO: They have said the treasury is going to do this in three hours. An hour and a half later, they pulled it back.WILLIAMS: Correct.PERINO: And now they're not going to do the sanctions anymore?WILLIAMS: Not on that one moment, but that's not to say that it's not coming.BOLLING: It violated the state -- it violated the agreement.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: They blatantly violated the agreement.PERINO: That's not doing what Hillary said.BOLLING: Not only in a small way, they violated it less than a mile away from an aircraft carrier -- U.S. aircraft carrier.WILLIAMS: There's no argument about that.BOLLING: It wasn't -- it was a violation of (inaudible).WILLIAMS: But the argument is, are you now going to escalate on the basis of that one incident?BOLLING: How about -- forget escalation, just stop paying.PERINO: It's not escalating.BOLLING: just don't send the (inaudible).GUILFOYLE: Well that's one start right there. But Eric, you brought something up that I think it's very important and it's significant in the region, and Doctor Sebastian Gorka, weighs in on this about the Saudi airstrike on the Iranian embassy. We'll get your reaction.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA, MARINE CORPS UNIVERSITY: We are obsessed with ISIS, with the bad guys.BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX AND FRIENDS CO-HOST: Right.GORKA: With the jihadist. They want to kill us here in America. But that's just part of this much larger war for who is going to control the Middle East.We should be supporting those guys who are on the frontline of this war, who are on our side already, especially Egypt, especially Jordan. And we're not touching them because, you know, since he used to wear a uniform, this administration doesn't like him. You know, I think there was a certain guy called Eisenhower.KILMEADE: Right.GORKA: He used to wear uniform and became the president. We have to understand that this is a war.KILMEADE: I got it.GORKA: Between two extreme religions.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: OK. So it's a war between two extreme religions. When you break it down, you put the map up there, you know the place they called the brink. To Middle East, it's between two warring religions. That's the issue.BOLLING: Yeah. Look, support our friends, support our allies, financially. Support our allies and the rest -- have at it. I mean -- I would disagree with the whole -- that the refugee crisis -- was there anything to do to stop that from happening?PERINO: Yeah.BOLLING: Take -- if you take out.PERINO: Take out Syria.BOLLING: Assad.PERINO: Take out Assad earlier.BOLLING: Then does the rebel forces, do they become ISIS and they're ticked off that we're there, anyway. I don't know. Look, support your friends. You have Jordan. You have Egypt to a certain extent. You have the Saudis, I guess.GUILFOYLE: That's what you said.BOLLING: And three or four other countries, and make sure that the brink doesn't go over the brink.GUTFELD: The other thing, too, is what has America done in absence, by not, not going there, where did they go? They went to America. We have devoted the past eight years to a full-blown identity crisis. America is wondering what we are. We're not thinking about the world. And so, instead of finding fault and perhaps, terrorists, and killers, and tyrants, and crazy people, we go after people with different views on marriage. Or we go after people that we believe might be racist because they're in law enforcement, or we call people sexist because they disagree with you on certain act.PERINO: Because they need media on Wall Street.GUTFELD: Because the media -- exactly. So what we have, what we have now is we have this internal conflict, which is draining all of our energy. So then when we look over there, it's like.GUILFOYLE: We're exhausted.GUTFELD: We're exhausted.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: I know I am.PERINO: Because you're tired to fight.GUTFELD: I'm too tired to fight.GUILFOYLE: I'm not.GUTFELD: Let's hug.GUILFOYLE: Oh no, OK, quickly hug -- anything else?BOLLING: Wrap it.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: But I like Gorka. I like his voice.GUILFOYLE: So do I, I find him.GUTFELD: He's got an amazing voice.GUILFOYLE: Soothing and amazing.GUTFELD: But --GUILFOYLE: Right Dana? Like Caso. Because we love Caso, that's an inside joke.PERINO: More to come on that.GUILFOYLE: All right, more to come on that.Coming up, it's a story reigniting the debate over refugees, a string of violent sexual assaults on women in Germany. By what police say are large groups of Arab and North African men. The horrific details, when The Five returns. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: After a thousand Arab men and North African men sexually assaulted dozens of women in Cologne -- a German city -- on New Year's Eve, its mayor, Henriette Reker, has a solution. She told women to stick together. Don't get split up, even if you're in a party mood.Well, thanks for that, Henriette. And when terrorists start shooting into clubs, be sure to wear bulletproof vests. When suicide bombers try to blow up a restaurant, wear body armor at dinner, especially on your head, even if it means taking your bouillabaisse through a straw.Oh yes, the European version of assimilation. Instead of arrivals acclimating to its host city, it's the citizen that must bend to the mob. And what's the best emasculated Europe can do? Hey women, watch out for the rapists, travel in groups -- like that's stopped them before. At least 60 victims were sexually violated by the encircling angry goons. And it was planned. The men tossed firecrackers into the crowd as another pile of fiends assaulted the distracted women. If it sounds familiar, it should. The Arab Spring was a rape-fest, as mobs isolated and assaulted women. No one got arrested. Now this practice, somehow, has been exported to Germany.So is this behavior, the product of a misogynistic system that sees women as chattel, forced to dress, behave and obey according to men? Well, ask any prominent American feminist, she'd probably say no. After all, these men aren't Republicans.So Kimberly, we always hear that we have a rape culture. You know, this is absolutely horrible and it was covered up for three days.PERINO: Yup.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, that's the thing.PERINO: By the press.GUILFOYLE: That's so upsetting about it. Like, where was the press on this? Why wasn't something like this leaked, you know?GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: But I think, perhaps, they wanted to date. Somebody called somebody. I don't believe this is like a coincidence in terms of covering it up, not letting the public knows about it. It's obviously horrific, shameful behavior about this going on, and the fact that they would try and not let the public know.GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: Because the public safety issue to me. You have to get it out there and you have to let them know what's going on, so people can protect themselves.GUTFELD: Right.GUILFOYLE: And have the facts. I mean, give me a break.GUTFELD: But --GUILFOYLE: But the first thing you have to do is to try and shut it down by having people be involved and aware.GUTFELD: Exactly. Dana, maybe, what her tip was meant -- was Earnest, but it's basically he's saying, mind your provocative behaviors, that not to the guys, like stop doing this.PERINO: I mean, you're right -- exactly. And it -- she probably regrets saying it or the way that it came out. Because I think she was -- in her mind, she was thinking, she was just trying to provide smart, good guidance to women.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: Instead, it's like, really, have we come this far as women in the world.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: In western societies? Where we are about to have a presidential candidate in the United States of America, the first woman presidential candidate, and we now, or actually now saying that you should blame the woman for her behaviors?GUTFELD: Yes.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: To assimilate to the mob? I think it is outrageous. Also, the mob understands what it's doing. They are taking advantage of western weakness and western tolerance. And someone has to stand up for western values. And if Angela Markel and the mayor of Cologne are not going to do it, who is?GUILFOYLE: Take away her -- what did she get? Time magazine, it's like -- take it away.PERINO: Person of the year.GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: Take it away.GUTFELD: That was back in the good old days. Eric, according to the Telegraph.GUILFOYLE: Two weeks ago.GUTFELD: Which is a U.K. paper, I think one or two suspects have already claimed to be Syrian refugees. So this -- I mean, Europe is in bad shape.BOLLING: Europe. And Dana points out, western cannot isolate Europe as part of the western that -- so the open border policy in Europe where can you travel from country to country.GUILFOYLE: Terrible.BOLLING: Exactly, you don't need a passport. They're trying to tighten some of those things up. But that migrant population, they're calling these guys migrants, well refugees and migrants.GUTFELD: Right.BOLLING: All the more reason to be very, very careful how fast you allow 10 or 200,000 refugees -- Syrian refugees into this country. Allegedly, up until this point, allegedly, there were a lot of rapes going on, right? The refugees and the migrants, but they were Muslims raping Muslim women. How long before it spreads to the Germans? Or how long of their fear --PERINO: That's what happened on New Year's Eve.BOLLING: Right, right, and how long before it becomes an epidemic. This maybe an isolated incident, hopefully it is. And how long to before it becomes an epidemic, like anything.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: And then they virus once you introduce the virus to the host, the virus spreads.GUTFELD: But I mean, it's already been introduced, yet. Remember Rotherham, we've talked about. That was the child rape scandal in, I think it was 2010, 1400 children abused by gangs, British, Pakistani men. But Juan, they -- the politicians seem very, very preoccupied with the hate speech that goes on after a terrorist attack. More so, than these physical assaults -- am I wrong?WILLIAMS: No. I think that it's a legitimate concern, though. I mean we're talking about Germany, we're talking about a country with a history here of, you know, isolating, alienating.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Belittling people and then, of course, we know the rest of the story.PERINO: But --WILLIAMS: So I think that if they have a legitimate concern.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: What Angela Merkel said was, ""you know what, I'm open, this country should not have a problem.""GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: ""with legitimate refugees coming in and seeking some kind of asylum."" The problem is the criminal problem, and Merkel has come out and said very directly, ""this will not be tolerated."" And that they will enforce the law and stop it. I think that message is, to me, more important than somehow feeding people who want to say -- this is the basis now, for treating the migrants as bad people as a whole. That's a mistake.GUTFELD: This is the problem. This was a practice that came from another part of the world. That is now here.PERINO: And I just feel like we have to clarify. The Nazis said that Jewish men were attacking women.WILLIAMS: Yes.PERINO: And it was false. This actually we know that this actually happened.GUILFOYLE: It's true.PERINO: This is not false to try to hurt the migrant community, this actually happened and it was perpetrated by the migrant men.WILLIAMS: The question is, the question is, you know, if the similar, exactly the historical point you just raised, the question is, is this now a widespread incident? Or was it a one-time or few times?GUTFELD: We don't know.WILLIAMS: Eric is talking about which women are being attacked.BOLLING: Is it too early to make that --WILLIAMS: Correct.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: This elsewhere. I want to get to the second layer. We know --we've heard today --GUILFOYLE: Allahu Akbar.GUTFELD: About a man with a knife.GUILFOYLE: Sure.GUTFELD: Was shot dead, approaching a Paris police station. He was carrying a knife and he was wearing a fake explosive vest. He was carrying a knife, he walked up to the police station and he yelled Allahu Akbar, and they killed him. My theory Dana, this is my kind of martyr. I think that this is a great thing. I think that this guy should be saluted, because he decided to martyr himself. He knew he was going to die. He committed suicide and he didn't take anybody. All ISIS martyrs should follow this.PERINO: OK.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: No, seriously.PERINO: No, I get -- I know, I say, I hear you. So he was -- it was a suicide by cops.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: OK. But what kind -- like how many resources are we going to have to deploy, so that we could deal with martyrs?GUTFELD: Set up a martyr center. A martyr center where you can come with.PERINO: At the brink?GUTFELD: Yes. Where you could -- at the brink, where you could come with your knife and you -- but you saw what he did, Eric?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Put a big-screen TV in a square.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: So that everyone can watch it and let everybody know.WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: It is 4 o'clock, come and martyr yourself. And you -- you know.GUTFELD: But you -- you realize you didn't --GUILFOYLE: Look at Juan, Juan's upset. He's like, oh.WILLIAMS: I am very upset.BOLLING: It's a great idea.WILLIAMS: I tell you what, OK. You know what?GUILFOYLE: Oh, man.GUTFELD: Yes, tell me.WILLIAMS: Go, go and hide (inaudible). If you want to go kill yourself -- go ahead. But don't put cops in danger, don't put us in danger, get away from me.GUTFELD: He stood in front of a police station with a knife and a fake vest. Clearly, he wanted to die and he didn't take anybody with him.GUILFOYLE: Well, he's just not.GUTFELD: I want all terrorist to be like that.GUILFOYLE: I mean he's not good. He's an ISIS reject or something.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: His name and picture. Can we --GUILFOYLE: This one is out.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: And he's no martyr to me. I got to tell you that.GUTFELD: He's not --WILLIAMS: This is a jerk.GUTFELD: No, he found the nirvana loophole.WILLIAMS: Well. Yeah, well, go do it.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: This is the nirvana loophole.GUILFOYLE: Juan, you really went out on a ledge there, he's a jerk?WILLIAMS: No. Well, I don't have any respect.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Take it easy, Juan.WILLIAMS: No.GUILFOYLE: You're getting really crazy.WILLIAMS: I mean we're talking a moment ago.GUILFOYLE: So that's it.WILLIAMS: About the German situation.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: And hate speech. So that mayor that you guys are criticizing because of what she said.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: And Dana said, maybe.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: It didn't come out the right way. That woman was stabbed.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: By somebody who was an anti-immigrant activist, right?GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: And so, you see these people now, they take their position and then advance it in terms of violence.GUTFELD: Do you see my point?WILLIAMS: I never gonna embrace that.GUTFELD: But you see -- no, but do you see my point, Juan? Compared to what happened in Paris.GUILFOYLE: I get it, yes.GUTFELD: Compared to other terror acts.GUILFOYLE: You've been saying this.GUTFELD: This guy, at least killed himself, didn't kill other people.WILLIAMS: Yes, and so.GUTFELD: I'm for that.WILLIAMS: As I put people in danger.GUILFOYLE: And we have said that. Whether its school shootings or anything else, just stay home and do yourself in.WILLIAMS: Yeah.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: We would see what suicide by cop.WILLIAMS: OK.GUTFELD: It's not an uncommon thing.All right, some usual theory, I admit. Next, another conductor has stepped aboard the Ted Cruz birther train. It's Senator John McCain -- coming up next in the Fastest 7.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Welcome back, time for --The politics edition and very fast of the Fastest seven minutes on television, three vibrant stories, seven vigorous minutes, one vehement host. First up, gender politics being deployed by, guess who, Hillary Rodham Clinton. Here's an ad checking the boxes, women, feminism, and gay marriage.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My name is Olivia. I'm a little feminist growing up to help all women with equal rights. I have two dads. I go to a school for kids with learning disabilities, and I wish that there were more public schools that could help kids with dyslexia like me. I hope you can be the first woman president of the whole United States. By the way, I'm really glad that there is now gay marriage legal all around the whole 50 states of America. I would be completely willing to help you out, after school. I bet I would be the youngest member of your campaign.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: We can do seven minutes on just this one. We've got to go fast. I guess, Greg, she ran out of time for abortion and income inequality.GUTFELD: Yes. You know what? I am totally for using kids in ads. And the ad I would like to see is a Hillary advertisement where you have a delightful 12-year-old girl saying, ""Thanks to the fearless fighting for abortion rights by people like Hillary Clinton, I was never born. If you want to see less of me, vote for Hillary.""PERINO: It rhymes.BOLLING: Yes. Dana, your thoughts on Hillary's checking the boxes.PERINO: I would say checked a lot of boxes, but if you're going for her target market, great ad.BOLLING: Great place to be.Juan.WILLIAMS: I just thought it was very effective. And again, I -- what struck me was the effectiveness of little Olivia, the 12-year-old, coming across as genuine. I thought it was very effective.BOLLING: Aww, K.G., I'm Olivia. I'm a little feminist.GUILFOYLE: No, but does she know?BOLLING: I don't know.GUILFOYLE: I know. I mean, sometimes we try to define it at this table.GUTFELD: I'm a feminist. You know I am.GUILFOYLE: No, you're effeminate. Effeminate, not...BOLLING: All right.PERINO: Oh! Mean!BOLLING: Do you want to talk back before we go?GUTFELD: No.BOLLING: All right. Then we'll go.Highlighting the fact that the GOP has become the big-tent party, the RNC released this new ad.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I got involved with the Republican Leadership Initiative simply because I wanted to be the best version of myself. Working with the 2016 Republican Leadership Initiative not only allows me to cultivate myself; it allows me to cultivate everyone around me.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To the next generation, earning it the hard way.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: To all those moms who just make it work.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trail blazers.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mentors, coaches and innovators.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All you second-chancers, welcome.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Where you lead others will follow.(END VIDEOTAPE)BOLLING: What do you think, Juan?WILLIAMS: That's terrific. Let me tell you something. My son is part of the RNC and the group that was involved with this. And I've got to tell you, I think they've done a great job: $300,000 ad buy. And the idea is that you get people to speak out about real issues that conservatives shared -- where their shared values between minorities and conservatives and make it apparent and get away from the whole race hustle industry that I think distorts things.BOLLING: Very positive ad.GUILFOYLE: I love the ad. I thought it was nice. Dana remarked about how handsome, the guy was so cute.PERINO: Yes. And also, I love the line, ""All you second-chancers."" I really like that. Because I think it's a good way to get someone to pay attention to you, or they might not have given you a look before or maybe not even a second look. But with something like that, ""We welcome all you second-chancers."" I like it.WILLIAMS: I think -- no, I think one of the people there had been to jail for criminal activity -- Greg.GUTFELD: The candidates, look at the candidates. The RNC is way more diverse than the DNC. If you look at who's running, it's three old white progressives. It's not a party: it's Peter, Paul and Mary. They should be singing ""Puff, The Magic Dragon.""BOLLING: And doing some of that, also.Finally, Ted Cruz's fill-in-the-blank game has heated up. A, an American born on foreign soil, and therefore qualifies to run for president. B, Ted Cruz is a Canadian. C, I don't like Ted Cruz anyway, so I'm going to make life difficult for him. Here's some ""C.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The answer, according to lawyers, is his mother was American, so he's a naturalized citizen. But that's never really been tested.SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: I do not know the answer to that. I know it came up in my race, because I was born in Panama, but I was born in the canal zone, which is a territory. Barry Goldwater was born in Arizona when it was a territory, when he ran in 1969...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But you were born on a base, too, weren't you?MCCAIN: Yes. It's a U.S. military base. That's different from being born on foreign soil. So they think -- I think there is a question. I'm not a constitutional scholar on that. But I think it's worth looking into.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right, K.G., common knowledge that the senator from Texas is not one of the most beloved senators on the floor.GUILFOYLE: Well, I mean, look, yes, that's the problem. But guess what? You know, he's going to lose some votes there, but he's got a lot of people supporting him. He's quite popular out, you know, on the stump and in the field and in the polls. So I guess that's what he's more concerned about.But you know, they're raising this issue. Now look at this. This is how many days everybody is talking about it. I've been get e-mails, saying dual citizenship. You can't qualify to be POTUS. And I mean, getting all kinds of stuff.BOLLING: Wouldn't you just think McCain would just say, ""Look, he's a citizen""?GUTFELD: Yes, I don't think -- this is much ado about nothing. But I will -- I've got to defend Ted Cruz. Because he has less friends than the guy who sleeps in the public library. His personality is abrasive. He comes off as annoying, yet, he's successful. And he's -- maybe he's great, because he can't rely on charm. He doesn't have charm or charisma that a Bill Clinton has. So he's getting far on substance. You know, Ted Bundy was charming, and look what he did.BOLLING: Dana, I believe John McCain, that was litigated in court, wasn't it? Wasn't that -- he was...PERINO: And it was settled. Yes, I believe so.I think, look, Ted Cruz will weather this storm. But one of the things that this whole controversy has conjured up is just it takes a lot of time and resources, and so your staff is having to deal with this. You're having to answer questions. Every time you're going to go do an interview, you know you're going to get asked about it.And when it comes to Senator McCain, I would just say this guy knows how to play politics very well, and I would say hats off to him.WILLIAMS: I must say -- I must say, I am shocked because of the politics. It's kind of like the enemy of my enemy is my friend, because McCain has no great love for Donald Trump. Remember, Trump insulted him, called him a loser for getting...GUILFOYLE: It's not John McCain's job to, like, be the lawyer for...BOLLING: Juan, the White House, they must be loving this controversy a little bit.WILLIAMS: I think Democrats on the whole think it's kind of curious. But nobody -- look, legal experts are all on Cruz's side. It's just that the Supreme Court has never ruled definitively on this issue.GUILFOYLE: Here's the deal. You know who Ted Cruz is? I was watching specials the other night, very late. He's a honey badger. He's just going to get it done. He's like relentless, like focused.WILLIAMS: You think he's successful? I don't think he ever got anything done.BOLLING: We're going to leave it right there. We're going to leave it right here.Next as Mayor Rahm Emanuel's police scandal widens in Chicago, why haven't we heard on the president on the crisis in his and my hometown? Stick around.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Does this mean even more trouble for Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel? Potentially damaging information has come to light over his handling of a fatal police shooting in 2014.According to emails, city lawyers decided to keep the video of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald's killing out of the public eye after consulting with the mayor. Emmanuel has apologized and has even fired his police superintendent but is refusing to give into calls for his resignation.Meanwhile, Democratic leaders, including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, have remained silent on the controversy. And here's Carly Fiorina on that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARLY FIORINA (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Rahm Emanuel clearly believes in the Clinton way. I must say, what's the Clinton way? Say whatever you have to say. Lie as long as you can get away with it, and do whatever you need to do to get re-elected.Just imagine, for one moment, if the mayor of Chicago were not President Obama's personal friend. Just imagine for a moment if this were a Republican. Most of the time Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are right out front, way before the facts are known, in saying that the police have done something terrible here.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: All right. Kimberly, I wanted to read something to you. So it says that not only do the emails show the effort to cover up what really happened to Laquan. It went to the top of the Emanuel administration. They also showed that the mayor's office was pulling strings at the independent police review authority, which as its name indicates, should be independent. And that's in the news today.GUILFOYLE: Yes. I mean, this is a big story. I think it's important for people to get it out there. But it -- I'm kind of surprised that it took this long for the truth to come out. I mean, this is sad.PERINO: A lot of people knew about it.GUILFOYLE: A lot of people. It was like an open secret. Like, everybody is talking about it. But somehow nobody knew about it.BOLLING: Because that's business as usual in Chicago.GUILFOYLE: Yes. In Chi-town.BOLLING: The most corrupt city on the planet. Forget America, on the planet. It probably...GUILFOYLE: Whatever you do, don't elect a president from there.BOLLING: Did you notice that the superintendent got fired?GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: Right.BOLLING: Really? Get rid of Rahm.GUILFOYLE: No, but there's going to be a body count.BOLLING: The only reason why he held that videotape back was so that Rahm Emanuel could get re-elected.WILLIAMS: I don't know about that. I will say this. There's a problem here for the mayor. Because the mayor wrote in the Chicago paper that the McDonald family had approached them and him about keeping the tape secret. Well now, what we know is that that's not true.GUILFOYLE: That's a lie.WILLIAMS: It seems to me that his credibility is now way out there. And this then brings in the question of what about the Democrats and how the Democrats handle this?Obviously, the Republicans are delighting in Rahm Emanuel, never one of their heroes, taking shots. But the bigger question is how does the city of Chicago deal with a mayor whose credibility is at low ebb, and can he come back? And how can he come back? Because his personality is...PERINO: Well, where are their principles? But really, where are their principles. The Obama White House has been very aggressive at immediately commenting on police brutality. And they've almost said nothing about this.GUTFELD: This happened right around re-election.WILLIAMS: Yes.PERINO: Right before his reelection.GUTFELD: It just shows you two Rahms don't make a right. He should be a Rahm-con.Anyway. This -- we have to remind everybody of this: that while there were murders taking place in Chicago, what was the most important thing in Rahm Emanuel's life? Going after Chick-Fil-A.As people were dying in his street, he was -- he took his spotlight and he said, ""We will never have Chick-Fil-A in our city."" He's such a boob; he's such a hack. He should be -- he should not be there. And the city for once should try a Republican mayor. Make a deal...BOLLING: They never have.GUTFELD: Just for five years, people. Try it for five years, and if it doesn't work, Republicans will promise they won't come back. But just try it once. Nothing else is working.GUILFOYLE: By the way, if it wasn't Rahm Emanuel, who's buddies with President Obama, there would be some kind of civil rights investigation with Loretta Lynch and everybody, like, pounding the pavement in Chicago.PERINO: Let's be clear. If Rahm Emanuel were to resign in disgrace, he would definitely get picked up by the Democrats on Wall Street the next day.GUTFELD: Or MSNBC.WILLIAMS: I don't know. You know, the...PERINO: We've got to run. The hit Netflix series ""Making a Murderer"" is making waves, with calls for the convicted murderer to be pardoned. But did the filmmakers mislead viewers by leaving out key evidence about the case, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: It's a hit show, but are filmmakers of the crime docu-series, ""Making a Murderer"" on Netflix, misleading viewers?It tells the story Steven Avery, a man who spent nearly two decades in jail for a sexual assault he did not commit. When he got out, he was convicted of another murder with his nephew.The series raises questions about that conviction, but some, like Judge Jeanine, argue critical evidence that implicates them was not included.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEANINE PIRRO, FORMER PROSECUTOR: There is evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that 12 jurors unanimously believed that this guy, Avery, killed the victim in this case, a 28-year-old woman.There's no question that if you make a decision that you're only going to present one side of the story, everybody is going to start saying, ""Oh, my gosh, this guy is not guilty."" I'd believe it, too, if I saw Netflix.It clearly taints the piece, because when you look at the evidence that was not presented, in this documentary as they call it, then you realize that what they did was try to sway their audience. This isn't a documentary.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: The filmmakers dismissed claims that they constructed a false narrative. They say they presented the state's most compelling evidence and could not include everything.GUILFOYLE: Boo!WILLIAMS: Sounds good. Kimberly is booing, and Gregory, he has gone crazy over this.GUTFELD: Well, they're not filmmakers; they're propagandists. This did not start out as a documentary. It was for the defense. If you actually saw the evidence, if you talked to people that had been following the case, which I have, the key evidence that was left out is absolutely astounding. He had been stalking her. He had threatened another woman at gun-point.The DNA on the bullet, that DNA that belonged to the woman was on his bullet from the gun that hung above his bed. They found non-blood DNA that belonged to him on the hood hatch of her car where they stuffed her body.By the way, I could go on for an hour for this. I just want to also remind people that this was a guy that took a live cat, dipped in oil, and threw it into a bonfire.WILLIAMS: OK. OK.GUTFELD: I'm not done, Juan. No, no, no. Let me finish. Let me finish.Anybody who participates in animal cruelty never turns back. That's a dry run for humanity.And by the way, all you little futon detectives at home watching the show thinking you're so smart, why don't you go the extra step and look a little -- just a little further? Just in remembrance of the victim, the woman who died.By the way, one last point.WILLIAMS: Yes.GUTFELD: The second to the last episode...WILLIAMS: Go right ahead.GUTFELD: ... you know what happens when somebody's in jail? There's a spinster that arrives, and says, suddenly, she thinks he's innocent and she falls in love with him. This happens all the time. She sees him, she finds love with this guy. You know who she is? She's the viewer. She's representative of every viewer that thinks he's innocent.WILLIAMS: Dana, 117,000 people have signed a petition asking Governor Scott Walker, not President Obama, because President Obama doesn't have authority, to pardon him. What do you say?GUILFOYLE: Denied.PERINO: I like the other question, which was, was Netflix negligent? I actually believe that Netflix knew exactly what they were doing or they didn't care, because the ensuing publicity has ensured that we've now been talking about ""Making a Murderer"" for seven days.GUILFOYLE: Yes, but they weren't negligent like you said.GUTFELD: ""Making a Martyr.""GUILFOYLE: ... it's now seasons. They did this on purpose. It is a false narrative, so they're just shysters.BOLLING: You know what they forgot, though, the defense. The one tactic they should have done? They should have had him try on that glove.GUTFELD: Exactly. Like Johnny Cochran.If Johnny Cochran were alive, he would have taken this case.WILLIAMS: All right. ""One More Thing,"" up next.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: It's time now for ""One More Thing."" Miss Dana.PERINO: OK. Debuting a new graphic. Check this out.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Dana's Corny Joke of the Day(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.PERINO: OK. Thanks to FiveFanPhotoshop for making that.All right. I have three. Are you ready?GUTFELD: Oh, yes.PERINO: Why is ""The Five"" so cool? We have a lot of fans.OK. That's a good one.OK. Why did the football coach -- what did the football coach say to the broken vending machine?BOLLING: Return something.PERINO: Give me my quarter back!GUTFELD: Oh!BOLLING: Oh!PERINO: Good one. Here's the last one.GUILFOYLE: You've got to change the graphic.PERINO: Are you ready? K.G., what does a nosy pepper do?GUILFOYLE: What does a nosy pepper do?PERINO: A nosy pepper do.GUILFOYLE: Rings the bell?PERINO: Gets jalapeno business.GUILFOYLE: What? Jalapeno business?BOLLING: I like that.GUTFELD: All up in your business.GUILFOYLE: All up in your business?WILLIAMS: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Oh, lord have mercy.GUTFELD: You were practicing saying that.GUILFOYLE: Say it again.PERINO: I can't say it. I tried all day.WILLIAMS: I think it was very good.It's not PC, but quite funny.GUILFOYLE: It's not PC?WILLIAMS: Definitely not.PERINO: Why?GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.WILLIAMS: I think you did a great job. I think you did a great job.PERINO: Jalapeno business.GUILFOYLE: All up in yo business.WILLIAMS: OK. There you go.PERINO: I was counting on you.GUILFOYLE: The Puerto Rican at the table. Keeping it real.GUTFELD: Oh, my God.BOLLING: You know, I identify as a Puerto Rican.GUILFOYLE: Do you?BOLLING: I do.GUILFOYLE: The tan.Bolling.BOLLING: OK. So last night the 600 -- or $500 million Powerball. No one won, so now it's up to 700 million. We got more tickets. But I asked you to Snapchat me some of what you would do with 500 million. I have four very quickly. I don't know names. Sorry, guys. I can't remember.""I would charter a cruise ship and take my family and friends to the Med."" That was that one.No. 2 says -- hold on -- ""Cash it and dance in it."" I love that one.Also, send his cutie to college. And finally, this one: ""$500 million, maybe buy a seat on 'The Five'."" Whoever you are, I've got news for you, I'm not selling for 500,000.PERINO: I will!GUILFOYLE: Juan.WILLIAMS: All right. So last night Jimmy Fallon had Billy Joel on ""The Tonight Show."" What you didn't see during the commercial break was they did an impromptu version of ""For the Longest Time.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(MUSIC: ""FOR THE LONGEST TIME"")(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: I love that song. And that was actor J.K. Simmons who was getting in on the fun.PERINO: It was a little pitchy.BOLLING: A little pitchy.GUILFOYLE: I know, right? Anyway, all right, good job. Be yourself.OK, mine is how about -- hello, how about these tickets, how much are they going for? And she's working out. She's working out to earn your money. That's a little selfie that she posted, saying, ""Getting ready. She heads to the U.K. and Europe starting February 29 through June 13. And six big days at Madison Square Garden.PERINO: I want to go. I want to go.GUILFOYLE: OK, when I -- if I get a ticket.PERINO: OK.GUILFOYLE: Greg.GUTFELD: I had a thing with an animal in it, but instead I just want to reiterate that ""Making a Murderer"" is a crime. Netflix, you're disgusting.BOLLING: What do they call those people?GUTFELD: They're called futon detectives, people who sit around and don't care about the victims. All they care about, ""Ooh, I put in ten hours. Oh, I deserve to be right."" You're wrong. You should be ashamed of yourself. Start it, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Is the futon open?Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 Roll Call, Inc.

9	9	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2013/08/27/all-star-panel-uproar-over-voter-id-laws/	All-Star Panel: The uproar over voter ID laws	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" August 26, 2013. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ERIC HOLDER, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: This morning we affirm that the struggle must and will go on in the cause of our nation's quest for justice until every eligible American has the chance to exercise his or her right to vote unencumbered by discriminatory or unneeded procedures, rules, or practices.SEN. JOHN CORNYN, R - TEXAS: This is deeply depressing to see the chief law enforcement officer in the country use partisan politics, and that's all it is, to drive a wedge between Americans based on race and ethnicity. It's really sad because we have come a long way.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Well, today at the White House President Obama met with civil rights leaders preparing to mark the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington. He will give a big speech Wednesday at the Lincoln Memorial. Today, as you see, meeting with civil rights leaders, and they'll be expecting some tough language on the growth of state voter I.D. laws. What about this? We are back with the panel. Steve, there are a number of states who have done it. You need a photo I.D. for a number of things, but yet this is a big issue this week for these black leaders.STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Including attending some of Eric Holder's speeches you have to show I.D. Look, it should be totally uncontroversial to have to show I.D. to vote. Now, whether that means that the states should take it upon themselves to provide more funding to make sure that everybody has the opportunity to get I.D.'s -- that's, I think, an open question. I think voting is such a fundamental right that even in times of tight budgets you would find some conservatives who would be willing to go along with a plan that would ensure that everybody has those I.D.'s.But the idea that you should be able to show up at a polling booth on the day the election, and not be registered, and not have to produce an I.D., and actually then vote, I think it's crazy.BAIER: Photo I.D., as I said is required to get in government buildings, courts, board a plane, rent a car, buy alcohol, buy cigarettes.MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: And voter I.D. laws when they are polled are quite popular. However, you have to put this in a bigger context. If the sum total of these laws, that aren't just showing photo I.D. at the polls it's also curtailing early voting, same day registration, same day polling opening, if the sum total of them are perceived as making it harder for one group of people to vote, lower income, minority, young people, registration on college campuses is curtailed in some of these states' efforts, it adds up to something that is -- Colin Powell talked about this this weekend, could produce a backlash against the Republican party.BAIER: With the justice --LIASSON: I think they do this at their peril, at the same time that I think the legal effort that the Obama administration is undertaking probably is doomed in the courts.BAIER: The Justice Department filing against the state of Texas.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Look - but look at this in context. It's all happening on the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington when the politics of it -- the Jim Crow laws, the voter restrictions had a huge impact on black Americans.  All of that changed and black American life has changed radically.Is the biggest issue in African-American life today the voter I.D. law? Is that going to alter the course of society, black America, the inner cities, the terrible standard in the schools, the breakdown of the family, and all of that? It's nostalgia of a movement that's intellectually bankrupt.BAIER: Are these voter I.D. laws upheld or not?KRAUTHAMMER: They will be upheld and they have been already in the highest court.LIASSON: I think they will be upheld, that doesn't mean they won't have a political problem for the people who passed them.HAYES: Yes, they will be upheld, they should be.BAIER: That's it for the panel. But stay tuned for an American hero with a story to tell.Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2013 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
