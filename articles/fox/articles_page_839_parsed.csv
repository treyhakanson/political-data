"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" May 31, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DONALD TRUMP, PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: When I raise money for the veterans, and it's a massive amount of money -- find out how much Hillary Clinton's given to the veterans. Nothing. And then I see a few guys standing out there, they don't know what they are there for. They have no idea. They are there because Hillary Clinton's campaign sent them.HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I, of course, have given money to veterans' charities. And John McCain and I actually helped raise funding for the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund. And I worked with Senator Lindsey Graham to expand health care to National Guard and Reserve members. So much of the work that I've done has meant tens of millions of dollars in increased benefits to veterans and their families.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Raising money for veterans is becoming a campaign issue today. Donald Trump eviscerating some members of the media asking him questions. And he raised some $5.6 million, he says, and all the checks are out, and he listed all of the organizations that have received these checks.Meantime, outside that event, as he was holding this news conference, there were protesters holding signs, veterans saying that Trump is essentially against veterans in some way. It turns out -- this is The Daily Beast saying this, that Marine veteran, Clinton supporter Alexander McCoy served as a spokesman for the demonstrators, went to great lengths to hide the Clinton campaign's involvement with organizing the demonstration. When reached by phone after that event McCoy acknowledged that Clinton campaign organized the conference call, bringing together possible attendees to that protest. One element of today's back and forth, we'll also talk about the Clinton/Sanders race.Let's bring in our panel: Steve Hayes, senior writer for The Weekly Standard; Ron Fournier, senior political columnist of National Journal, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer.OK, Steve, kind of a heated event today between Trump and reporters, saying he's paid the money to the veterans.STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Well, a little eruption from Donald Trump today. For five months reporters of all stripes have been trying to get the details of what this event did, and asking I think fairly basic journalistic questions like, what was the total amount given? Who received these funds? And in some cases, who gave these funds? And they have had very little luck getting that information from the Trump campaign.I would argue that in a PayPal economy, when I can wire you $25 while we're sitting here at this table and you'll have it in the bank account tomorrow, the Trump campaign should have been able to provide that information much earlier than it has. Now, it took him five months. It's a good thing Donald Trump raised money for the veterans. People have raised questions about why he did it and the original intent of that event to distract from the FOX News thing, but I think basically we're all better off when private individuals or private organizations give money to veterans groups.I do think when Trump is complaining about the news media targeting him on this, I don't they're targeting Donald Trump. I think they are asking very basic questions.One last thing, he's right, though, I think to suggest that there's a double standard, that the media are far more interested in his businesses and his alleged scams than they are in Hillary Clinton's fundraising and Clinton Foundation and what have you, although he shouldn't really be surprised by this.BAIER: OK, here's just a taste of some of the back and forth with reporters today at the news conference.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: And on behalf of the vets, the press should be ashamed of themselves. They are calling me, and they are furious. And instead of being like, thank you very much, Mr. Trump, or Trump did a good job, everyone said who got it, who got it, who got it? And you make me look very bad. I have never received such bad publicity for doing such a good job.I like scrutiny, but you know what, when I raise money -- excuse me, I have watched you on television, you're a real beauty. What I don't want is when I raise millions of dollars, have people say, like this sleazy guy right over here from ABC. He's a sleaze in my book. You're a sleaze.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: It went like that for a while. Obviously the media, Ron, is an easy target for politicians. We talk about that a lot.RON FOURNIER, NATIONAL JOURNAL: Yes. Hillary Clinton does the same thing, tries to fob off her responsibility on us.BAIER: Maybe not in the exact same way, but she does.FOURNIER: She'll get there. Bottom line is Donald Trump deserves credit for raising money for veterans. There's not enough attention given to veterans in this country. Good for him for doing that. I don't think this story has big legs.But it does remind us of things we have already known about Donald Trump and should concern us when we decide whether or not to vote for him. He's obviously very thin-skinned. He obviously does not want to be held accountability. He's obviously a disingenuous man. There's many things he said today that just were not true. For example, he said from the beginning I only thought I could raise $1 million. You said the day of the Fox News debate that you were going to raise $6 million.And sleazy reporters, yes, some of us are sleazy, but if it hadn't been for the media, he would not have donated this million dollars. The fact of the matter is, it's a fact, not an opinion, he did not donate his $1 million that he promised until The Washington Post called him on it last week.BAIER: Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I think this demonstrates, this is a classic Trump maneuver. He counterattacks against the press because you can't lose in doing it. There's no love lost for the press, and I think he did it effectively. And it distracts on the fact A.P. is reporting that half the donations were given after The Washington Post began to look into the story, which indicates that the press was not only doing its job but it actually stimulated the execution of these donations.BAIER: The Trump campaign says -- the Trump campaign in response to that says they added veterans groups and there was a vetting process and that the checks went out in an orderly fashion. That's their response.KRAUTHAMMER: That's fine. Then I will leave it as a heck of a coincidence.But on the other hand, I think in the longer run, yes, this plays very well. It plays particularly well to the Republican primaries. How is it going to play in the general election? It's not that people don't like seeing attacks on the press, but it is a sense of Trump's character. Is this what you want in the White House? He was asked, is this how you're going to be behaving in the White House? He says, yes.I think at one point he was asked about the attack on Susana Martinez, which he had said was because the economy was bad in New Mexico. But in this press conference, he said, well, she wasn't very nice to me. Now is that going to be the criteria to which a president decides whether to attack, praise, or just ignore anybody else, either a politician or foreign leader of another country, by the criteria of how good are they to me? That is a peculiar criteria, and it appears to be the only one that applies to Trump.BAIER: All right, he also ripped on Bill Kristol for this third-party talk about an independent conservative run. Now we are learning a name that perhaps may fit that wish list for Bill Kristol and others, and that is David French. He's a National Review writer. This is from Bloomberg: ""Two Republicans intimately familiar with Bill Kristol's efforts to recruit an independent presidential candidate to challenge Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and told ""Bloomberg"" Politics that the person Kristol has in mind is David French, whose name the editor of The Weekly Standard floated in a current issue of the magazine. French is a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom according to the website of National Review, where French is a staff writer. He's a constitutional lawyer, a recipient of the Bronze Star, and an author of several books. He lives in Columbia, Tennessee, with his wife Nancy and three children."" Not exactly a huge name, Ron, that is gaining a lot of attention.FOURNIER: No. But the fact of the matter is we might not need a huge name to make a difference in this campaign. There's a lot of evidence out there data-wise and anecdotal that the public is sick of these two parties, and we've never had two major party nominees who were this unpopular. I think you could have a dead man or woman run outside the Democratic and Republican Party and get five percent to 10 percent. We already see double digits with Gary Johnson and Weld. So French or whose Kristol comes up with would be the fourth ticket, we could have five, six. It is not totally inconceivable that this thing gets thrown to the House.KRAUTHAMMER: I like the idea of a dead man.BAIER: But in all honesty --HAYES: He can't lie, at least.(LAUGHTER)BAIER: Trump's response to this, Steve, is that this throws the election to Hillary Clinton.HAYES: yes. Well, I think the people who are critical of efforts like this one ought to decide if it's really unimportant and not going to have any effect or whether it's going to throw the election to Hillary Clinton, because you hear both arguments.Look, I have not talked to Bill Kristol in detail about this. I don't know even that that is actually the candidate, though it may well be. As you noted, he floated it in the magazine, this along with several other names.I think what he wants to do is to go somewhere to make sure that there's a bigger debate, to have a debate that goes beyond Hillary Clinton on the one hand and Donald Trump on the other. As Ron pointed out, you saw The Washington Post/ABC poll that said six in 10 Americans either hate or dislike both of the two major party candidates. Last week there was another poll that showed that Vladimir Putin had lower unfavorables than either of those two. This is about getting people another choice.BAIER: Sure. But until you put the name behind it, you don't know where the numbers fall. Last word.KRAUTHAMMER: Whatever name it is, I think it's a mistake for conservatives to run another candidate with the explicit intent essentially of blocking Trump from winning. Either he's going to win -- he is the nominee of the GOP, chosen by the people, he's either going to win or not. And if he doesn't win, he should not be able to claim he was stabbed in the back. That would be a terrible mistake in the future.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

IT IS FOX NEWS' POLICY THAT CONTRIBUTORS DISCLOSE POSITIONS THEY HOLD IN STOCKS THEY DISCUSS, THOUGH POSITIONS MAY CHANGE. READERS OF ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.Wild Market Swings Spark New Recession FearsGary B. Smith: I think we are every single sign I look at, whether you look at macro signs of GDP growth, household income, demand for oil, whether you are looking at the financial sector, the charts, I can't see one positive sign out there. Normally getting brief pullbacks, you see, well the tech sector is strong or Netflix is still doing well. I go through every single indicator I look at. I can't find one that's positive. I think the market is hurting. I definitely think we are headed to a recession. We are probably long overdue. I think this could be a painful one.John Layfield: We're the tallest leprechaun. That's not saying a lot. There aren't many good signs out there. The Middle East is in crisis. More important than the Middle East being at war. You have countries like Qatar, Saudi Arabia for the first time they can't fund their own government so they're selling a lot of their stocks, it's killing European banks, so you see a lot of negatives going forward. Most of the signs I don't think we are headed for a consumer recession. We are certainly in a corporate recession. We had three straight quarters of declining profit t. Capex is the lowest spending we had in five years. We are seeing a lot of bad signs. I think we will be a growth but a meager growth going forward.Chuck Rocha: I blamed it on Donald Trump. I was watching him. He said he will make everything great again. I'm sure everything will be fine. I was looking, car sales are up. We are creating jobs; oil is at an all-time low. We have slow GDP growth, I sound like Gary B, I'm not coming on this show anymore. I would say it is slow growth. The funneling of Bernie Sanders is going to millionaires and billionaires. People like me being left out. I think that's the problem.Suzy Welch: If there even was a recovery, you can make the argument there wasn't a full recovery. One number that has me worried, the number that has me worried is venture capital spending in Silicon Valley. It was 19 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015, down to 9 billion the first quarter of this year. That's scary the tech sector was like the last bulletproof sector. If you look at analyst reports, you average them out. They'll tell you there is a 25 to 35 percent chance there is going to be a recession in the next 18 months. Okay. That's, you know, that's not the preponderance of it. That's sort of like a weather forecaster saying, go outside, there is only a 25 to 35 percent chance you will get frost bite. That's not 100 percent chance. It will be nasty out. I think it will be nasty going forward. If are you a consumer or somebody who works. You got to batten down the hatches. When you vote, you have to think jobs, jobs, jobs, that's the thing that will get hit.Jonas Max Ferris: If you don't look abroad; it's hard to say things are falling apart here. There is serious recessions in the emerging market to some extent in Europe they have a banking crisis. For us, I say we can dodge it. It's been a long time. I still think the consumer at home has seen the benefits of the world's problem. Car sales were brought up. Mortgage rates are staying low, gas is pushing a dollar in some places because of a huge foreign problem hopefully won't spread and destroy America. So at this point I think you can sit tied and enjoy the benefits of a collapsing world.New Wage Rage Protesters Target Democratic Presidential CandidatesJohn Layfield: It's an arbitrary number they have chosen. I'm fixing it long term and take unions and politics out of it. I was in Seattle. I paid $50 bucks for parking. I asked, Why is it so much? He said with the new minimum wage we had to raise everything in Seattle. You are seeing it hurting the rental car business, the parking business. It's going to technology, which is what will happen with these jobs, it's going to technology where there is not a minimum wage.Gary B. Smith: They're doing the opposite. They're not opening them, they're closing them in china town, in Los Angeles, the residents there were dying to have their Wal-Mart there. They love their Wal-Mart there because it provided a real need. It had to close because they couldn't afford the $15 minimum wage. You know, John talked about Seattle, of course one of those billionaires who can't afford $50 for parking. But somehow, the point is restaurant prices there have gone up 7 to 8 percent . Prices are passed onto the consumer. Whether you look at anecdotes or studies, $15 minimum wage, everything above mark will hurt the economy.Chuck Rocha: You need to back up. I make these union signs. I make the TV ads for the politicians, it's called don't be hurting my job here. Back to this point, you can tie it to the other conversation we were having because of no real wage growth and a slow recovery, there's lots of people that have lots of minimum wage jobs. I say all for them. If you can demand and get more, if you get more money, you are going to spend more money. We can continue to have this debate. I think as long as working people are trying to demand it and let their voice be heard. It's a good thing. They may not always get it. I can call you a campaign sign. Call me up.Suzy Welch: I agree with Gary and John. Let everybody raise the minimum wage. This is like letting your child have all the Halloween candy the night of Halloween, you say don't do it. Eventually, they have to learn the hard way it's bad for them. You let them eat the candy, it's not pretty. Let the wages go up and the jobs will vanish. There will be fewer jobs. Next time they'll protest for training, not for these low paying service jobs but higher paying high quality jobs. That's what they should be protesting about. More jobs, not higher minimum wage.Jonas Max Ferris: Global wage stagnation is not going to be curable with a decree by the government on what the wages should be. That said, it is a good insurance policy against Bernie Sanders and that element. There is always a risk in capitalism that people will revolt. You will have more damages than a slightly artificially high wage. Which is what we are talking about here. I say, Bernie Sanders wouldn't be leading Hillary Clinton if Obama put this index into inflation years ago. It would have quitted that element of the debate down. I say you need it. Maybe not 15. A lot of companies cost high unemployment. It's better when other people revolt.Facebook Stepping Up Efforts to Shutdown Profiles With Terror LinksSuzy Welch: I don't think we can throw enough money at this problem. I think it's a part of private efforts to do it. It's stupid money, nothing will happen. Fighting Isis messaging has gotten very sophisticated is not a job for bureaucrats or admin Madison Avenue. This is a gob for people who have been radicalized and left and people experts in at risk youth. Those are the people going to Isis. Hopeless young men who are being promised a future. The messaging has to be sophisticated in presenting another kind of future. I think Facebook and Twitter and the government all together wisely with smart and focused efforts.Chuck Rocha: That's right. The FBI started this goat game. It shows young children not to go down the propaganda highway by destroying a goat. I think more so than that it should be a private public thing. I said this before. I went online last week and looked at peanut butter treats for the best bulldog. Which I have. Everywhere I turn I see the treats online, if they can track me getting dog treats. They should be able to track these people that want to destroy our country and get rid of them.Gary B. Smith: It sounds like it's ripped from the page of the onion. One bill counter prevents online radicalization. First of all, they are just doing that now. Second of all, I bet Isis is scared of their planning session. The other one, Chuck's point, they will go to colleges and have the students develop counter-narratives for teenagers and young adults. Oh my gosh, I better that quaking in their boots. I'm not sure we're addressing the right problem. They sound like a wonky thing and which will get nothing done.Jonas Max Ferris: The white house met in early January. It's a one of page request as Gary B was saying. I played the goat game. It made Donkey Kong look like World of Warcraft  I'm sad at the final thing.John Layfield: This is the same government that spent hundreds of thousands on the Obamacare website and had to fix it. Had officials with classified e-mails, they couldn't organize a rock fight much less something to do with computers. Put a bounty on it. Pay anonymous to do it.Stock PicksGary B.
