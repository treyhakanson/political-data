This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SHANNON BREAM, GUEST HOST: Our next guest made big headlines with her CPAC speech and won new Republican fans when she went after the woman expected to be the lead candidate for the Democrats. Watch this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARLY FIORINA, FORMER HEWLETT-PACKARD CEO: Like Mrs. Clinton I too have traveled the globe. Unlike Mrs. Clinton, I know that flying is an activity, not an accomplishment.(APPLAUSE)I have met Vladimir Putin, and I know that his ambition will not be deterred by a gimmicky red reset button.(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: Carly Fiorina is the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard and share of the American Conservative Union. Carly, thank you for joining us tonight.You got a lot of good feedback on your speech yesterday. When you first started testing these waters some thought that you were very much a long shot. But it sounds like you're making progress in sort of exposing yourself to a group of potential voters. How do you feel like it went this week?FIORINA: Well, I've been very encouraged. First of all I've been coming to CPAC for several years now and I'm honored to serve as the chairman of the foundation here. And CPAC is just a great event. You know, it brings together conservatives from all across the country to talk about the issues that we all care about. So the event itself is really invigorating and energizing, especially all the young people we have here.As for my own speech I was very pleased with how it was received. And just so delighted to have so many people here come up to me and encourage me to run and encourage me to continue to speak out.  BREAM: You have been very bold in the lead-up to this and including this speech in going directly after Hillary Clinton, former secretary of state, former senator, asking her to identify some accomplishments. So how do you respond to your critics who say you haven't held office, she has a different kind of experience that may better equip her to run for the White House. How do you respond?FIORINA: Well, I actually think most Americans, a lot of Americans for sure, are sort of tired of professional politicians. And the things that qualify you for high office are an understanding of how to make tough decisions and tough environments and understanding of how the economy works and understanding how the world works and understanding of how bureaucracies work and how technology can transform them. And I have those experiences. I'm not quite sure when we became a nation that believed that only professional politicians could run for office. It's not how we were founded. Ours was intended to be a citizen government. And because I come from outside the world of politics, I think it's a very fair question to ask people to speak about their resolves. Outside the world of politics we actually are expected to produce results day after day. So when I asked Mrs. Clinton, what are your accomplishments, that's the world I come from where we need to be held accountable for our results.  BREAM: And coming from the world of business I know that in your speech that you said now in the U.S., it's your opinion that we're destroying more businesses than we are allowing to be created. How would you rectify that?FIORINA: Well, actually it's not my opinion. It's fact. And indeed the Gallup poll has identified this as a fact. It's been clear for some time that we are destroying more small businesses than any time in the last 40 years and we have to solve it by attacking crony capitalism. Crony capitalism is alive and well. Elizabeth Warren's right about that. The little secret is of course that big companies do well with big government and likewise, because big companies can handle all the complexity and all the rules. They can take advantage of all the complexity and all the rules. But meanwhile small businesses are disappearing because they cannot deal with the complexities. And the powerless are trapped in a web of dependence without sufficient opportunities. So the way to solve these problems is with less government, not more.  BREAM: All right. Carly Fiorina, keep us updated on your decision making schedule. Good to see you tonight. Thanks for joining us.
