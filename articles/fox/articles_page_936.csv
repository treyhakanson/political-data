 Lessons for GOP Candidates 
"	It now appears that the economic conditions facing the incumbent Democrats next year will be at least as negative as those that led Republicans to defeat in 2008. So Republicans now have a remarkable opportunity, but they need to be careful. Public alarm over deficits and debt may be at an all-time high, but in their zeal to curb spending, Republicans must not seem to care more about shrinking the budget than expanding the economy.The two goals are not incompatible, but Republicans must make the connection between them, or risk looking like a party of accountants. And this may be harder than it appears, especially with the intense pressure Tea Party activists will surely exert for far deeper spending cuts than the GOP, with control of only one House of Congress, is likely to achieve anytime soon.On foreign policy, some congressional Republicans and some GOP presidential candidates seem ready to pull the plug on the limited Libya operation, and to head for the exits in Afghanistan as well. Neither of these conflicts is popular so it may look like good politics to oppose them.But does the party of Ronald Reagan want to become the party that helped a wounded brute like Muammar Qaddafi survive in power? Or let Afghanistan regress into the terrorist haven that gave us 9/11?President Obama may be inclined to relinquish the traditional U.S. role in the world and as he might put it, to lead from behind. But do Republicans really want to follow him?

Rep. Dennis Kucinich Falls Out of Favor With Hometown Paper

"	"Now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine:The Usual Suspects?The former deputy head of the Egyptian Domestic Security Agency says the group behind yesterday's deadly bombings in Dahab is not Arab Terrorists -- it's Israel.General Fouad Allam, who in 2004 pinned the bombing of a Sinai hotel on the Israeli Intelligence service Mossad, said only the Israelis had anything to gain from carrying out the attacks arguing that Arabs would not have targeted areas frequented by Egyptians.What's more, Allam believes Mossad is involved because, just prior to the bombings, Israel warned its citizens to avoid the region because of possible terror attacks. Rush to Judgment?The Center for Responsive Politics is calling on Illinois Representative Bobby Rush to recuse himself from a key telecommunications vote before the Energy and Commerce Committee -- after a report that the community center he founded received a $1 million grant from a major phone company.Dennis Kucinich may have gained national prominence during his long shot 2004 presidential campaign, but his national ambitions have cost him the support of his hometown paper.Parents Rights Coalition argues the school is legally obligated to notify parents when teaching sex education. But the school's superintendent says the book isn't sex-ed, but is merely ""teaching children about the world they live in.""The same school made headlines last year after sending kindergarten students home with a ""diversity book bag,"" including material on homosexual families.-- FOX News' Aaron Bruns contributed to this report."

But the problem is less partisan than ideological.The battle over spending and debt is being fought along the deepest fault line in American politics.Republicans believe deeply that raising income tax rates for anybody -- including the rich -- is economically dangerous and politically suicidal. Besides, they say, it wouldn't raise enough money.But Democrats, with equal fervor, believe that cutting entitlement benefits -- benefits which are the big driver of deficits -- is to attack the crowning achievements of their party's drive for social justice in America. Nancy Pelosi even directed her appointees on the super committee to oppose any such cuts.Bear in mind, though, that the super committee was not supposed to produce a balanced budget, only a plan to lop off about one eighth of the projected deficit over the next 10 years. Surely you'd think they could split the difference: some tax increases in exchange for some entitlement cuts and get a deal.But that underestimates the political wrath that member of both parties would face from their base voters for making such a deal. You can get politicians to buck their bases in a national emergency. The ballooning national debt may be a crisis, but neither the politicians nor the public seems to see it as an emergency.
