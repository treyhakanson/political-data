This is a rush transcript from ""Hannity,"" November 3, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Welcome to ""Hannity."" All right, just five days to go before you, the American people, head to the polls, Democrats are being exposed for exactly what they are, divisive, manipulative, and tonight, we'll show you downright racist. In just a few minutes, Rudy Giuliani, Laura Ingraham and others will join us.But first, Project Veritas is out with a disturbing new undercover video.  It appears to show a major Democratic donor making racist comments about African-Americans. Now, Fox News, as we've told you before -- this is the fifth in a series -- has not independently verified the content of what you're about to see. We've got to warn you. This is beyond shocking.  Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Our journalist was speaking with Leah and Benjamin Barber (ph). Mr. Barber is a well-known political theorist and author, and he is a major donor to Democrats and specifically to Hillary Clinton.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And you think (INAUDIBLE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You'd think that they would...(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ... Holocaust.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, it depends on (INAUDIBLE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. [AUDIO GAP](CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Same thing?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) blacks (INAUDIBLE) helping the other side (INAUDIBLE) (EXPLETIVE DELETED) (INAUDIBLE) only helping the enemy (INAUDIBLE) help someone, it will be different, and maybe (INAUDIBLE) somehow to save my race (ph) (INAUDIBLE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Outrageous and beyond shocking! Now, we've reached out to the Clinton campaign and to Benjamin Barber asking for a comment. We've not heard back from them.If you're surprised by that video, you shouldn't be this is exactly who the Democrats really are and it's exactly how Democrats really feel. This video is not just some one-off example of the feelings of Democrats and what they truly feel and the feelings they hold. It's the norm in Hillary Clinton's Democratic Party.Now, let me explain to you, over the summer, WikiLeaks released thousands of emails from the DNC, which at the time was run by Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. And what was discovered is that high-level staffers and their associates -- they made racist, anti-semitic, homophobic, misogynistic and sexist comments. In one email, they made fun of a woman's name. Quote, ""(INAUDIBLE) oh, name, oh, I'm sorry, boo (ph). I hope you get a raise with this title.""And in another email, DNC staffers spoke about using Senator Bernie Sanders's Jewish faith against him in states like West Virginia and Kentucky. In a separate incident, a now former DNC finance director used a homophobic term, writing, quote, ""I love you, too, no"" -- and you can read it yourself.And that's not all. We also learned through WikiLeaks that the DNC approved a fake Craigslist ad that they used to attack Donald Trump that featured extremely sexist language. Now, you would think that Hillary Clinton, who accuses everybody else of saying horrible things -- that she'd be so disgusted that she would disavow all of those who were involved. No, she didn't.In fact, after Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced to step down as the head of the DNC -- well, Clinton made her part of her campaign! Now, Clinton also said back in June that Wasserman Schultz is, quote, ""a long-time friend."" Now, would you call someone who oversaw that type of conduct a long-time friend? I doubt it.And could you imagine, by the way, just for a second, if Donald Trump said or did even a fraction of this, the left in this country would go nuclear and insane. But when their own people say it, deafening silence. You can hear the crickets!That's because the Democrats have a long history of these types of remarks.  Now, let's go down Memory Lane. Let's take a look about what they said about President Obama. You may remember this. According to The New Yorker, during the 2008 primaries, Bill Clinton said this to Senator Ted Kennedy about Obama, quote, ""You know, a few guys ago, this guy would have been carrying our bags.""Senator Harry Reid also made racist comments about Obama. According to the book ""Game Change,"" Reid was, quote, ""wowed by Obama's oratorical gifts and believed that the country was ready to embrace a black presidential candidate,"" especially one such as Obama, light-skinned, African-American, with no, quote, ""Negro dialect"" unless he wanted to have one.And of course, the vice president, Joe Biden, crazy uncle Joe -- he said this about Obama.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: (INAUDIBLE) got the first sort of mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. I mean, that's a storybook.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Storybook? Well, he's articulate, clean, takes a shower.  Shocking.Now, instead of recognizing their own history of rampant racism, the Democrats do what they always do, and they falsely accuse Republicans and conservatives of the very thing they are guilty of!Now, here's President Obama playing the race card and trying to tie Donald Trump to the KKK. He did this today!(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: If you accept the support of Klan sympathizers before you're in office, you'll accept their support while in office.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Outrageous! Now, you would think that President Obama, when making such an explosive claim, that he'd have facts to back it up. But he doesn't. He plays the race card.Now, the KKK is a domestic terrorist group, and frankly, Donald Trump isn't connected to any domestic terrorist groups in any way, shape, manner or form.Now, if we're talking about connections to domestic terrorists, well, then we should point out, of course, President Obama's ties to the unrepentant domestic terrorists Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn. Mr. President, you want to go there? Let's talk about it. Not to mention, I don't think that Donald Trump's pastor -- I don't think his pastor of 20 years ever said these things.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REV. JEREMIAH WRIGHT: The stuff we have done overseas is now brought right back into our own front yard! America's chickens are coming home to roost!No, no, no, not God bless America, God damn America! That's in the bible!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Remember Obama said, He is like family to me, 20 years in the pews, but I had no idea he thought this way.Hillary Clinton -- she's also made similar accusations against Donald Trump, trying to paint him as a supporter of the KKK while ignoring her very own relationship to someone who was actually in the Ku Klux Klan. And here's what Hillary said about her mentor, former Klansman Robert KKK Byrd right after he died.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, THEN-SECRETARY OF STATE: Senator Byrd was a man of surpassing eloquence and nobility. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance and he was always generous with his time and his wisdom. I admired his tireless advocacy for his West Virginia constituents. As secretary of state, I continue to rely on his advice and counsel.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Her mentor. How is she praising someone like that? Now, keep in mind this is the same Robert Byrd that said this on Tony shows -- Tony Snow's show years ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. ROBERT BYRD, D-W.VA.: A white (EXPLETIVE DELETED. I've seen a lot of white (EXPLETIVE DELETED in my time, if you want to use that word. But we've all -- we all -- we just need to work together to make our country a better country.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: That guy right there, former Klansman, Hillary Clinton's mentor!Now, Clinton and the Democrats -- for decades, they tried to wrongfully strike fear into the hearts of African-American voters. Take a look at Al Gore going into his preacher voice and saying this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FORMER VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE: It's wrong what the leader of the Republican Party and this Congress are doing in blocking an accurate census because they don't want to count everyone that they don't think they can count on.They are in favor of affirmative action if you can dunk the basketball or sink a 3-point shot! But they're not in favor of it if you merely have the potential to be a leader in your community and bring people together!  Don't tell me we've got a color-blind society!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Then he went on to say Republicans don't even want to count black Americans in the census. Now, Clinton and the Democrats have also relentlessly pandered to African-American voters by doing things like this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I don't feel no ways tired.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I come too far from where I started from.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Nobody told me that the road would be easy.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Now, why does Al Gore and Hillary change their tone, their pitch, their cadence, their entire delivery if they go before predominantly black audiences?Now, we also we cannot ignore Hillary Clinton's claims to be the champion of human rights, women's rights, gay rights. Remember, the Clinton Foundation accepted millions and millions and millions in donations from countries that treat women, gays and lesbians and religious minorities horribly. Her foundation has taken millions of dollars from countries like Saudi Arabia -- look at the money right there that they gave to the Clintons and the Clinton Foundation -- Kuwait, the UAE, Brunei, Qatar, Oman, Algeria.Joining us with reaction, nationally syndicated radio talk show host, our friend, Larry Elder is with us. I hear you're at a big event tonight. Is that true?LARRY ELDER, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: I am. I'm here in Colorado, another swing state. We're going to Ohio tomorrow, and then Pennsylvania, did Nevada yesterday.HANNITY: Awesome. You know, one of the reasons -- when the president came out with that Klan comment today, I can't take it! I can't tolerate, as a conservative -- Larry Elder, you want to say something horrible about somebody, call them a racist. And the Democrats do this every single election season. And what the president of the United States and the Clinton campaign are doing by playing this card is a national disgrace and a lie! But it's the very thing they themselves behind closed doors are guilty of.ELDER: And Sean, it is nothing new. They say behind closed doors what they often say in public, and they get a pass. Claire McCaskill, when she first ran of Senate, said that George W. Bush let people die on the rooftops in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina because they were poor and they were black.Gloria Allred referred to Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell when they were in the Bush administration as, quote, ""Uncle Tom types."" Barney Frank was talking about Hurricane Katrina and he said George Bush responded sluggishly because he wanted ethnic cleansing by inaction.And Harry Belafonte, Sean, said exactly in public what that man said in private. He said -- he was calling George W. Bush a racist, and somebody pointed out that Bush had appointed a lot of black to high positions, referring to Condi Rice and Colin Powell,and Harry Belafonte said, Well, Hitler had a lot of Jews higher up in the hierarchy, as well.So they said it publicly! You had Charlie Rangel saying that Republicans don't say N word anymore or F word anymore. They just say, Let's cut taxes. I can on and on and on.Joe Biden gives a speech before a black audience in 2012, and he's criticizing Mitt Romney for not wanting further regulation on Wall Street.  And he tells his black audience he wants to unchain Wall Street, wants to put y'all back in chains.They do it all the time!  They use the race card as a sword and as a shield.HANNITY: And you can't go to a 7-Eleven unless you have a slight -- or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent.I guess the only thing is, this by the president of United States -- they - - you know, this is identity politics. They play the race card. They play the gender card. All these tactics -- they divide this country, rich versus poor, black versus white, young versus old. It never stops.And of course, every Republican, every conservative wants to take grandma in her wheelchair and throw her over the cliff...ELDER: Right.HANNITY: ... and kill her, and meanwhile grandma now is paying, on average, $4,100 a year per family in health care costs because of Hillary and Obama!ELDER: And Sean, the goal is to tell black people that the number one problem facing the black community is racism -- not bad schools, not the breakdown of the family, not jobs, it's racism.So you have Debbie Wasserman Schultz, when she was head of the DNC, saying the Republican Party wants to drag us back to Jim Crow, wants to turn back the clock on Civil Rights.Why don't you name a name? Is Paul Ryan out to commit genocide? Is Mitch McConnell out to commit genocide? Is Ted Cruz out to commit genocide? It is ridiculous, but they know that it works. It's a dogwhistle that they blow, and a lot of black people buy into it because the Democratic Party has taught black people that they are victims, that those guys over there, those Republicans are victimizers, and by the way, we wear the white horse -- we wear the white hat and ride the white horse and we're the saviors.  And a lot of people have bought into it.HANNITY: All right, Larry, we always appreciate you being here. Good luck at your event tonight. Thank you for being with us.ELDER: My pleasure. You got it.HANNITY: And coming up, according to reports, the FBI has uncovered e- mails on Anthony Weiner's laptop that are related to Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state. And by the way, they're not duplicates. Ed Henry has a full live report tonight. Plus, we'll get reaction from former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani and Laura Ingraham.And also later tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Clintons from dead broke to worth hundreds of millions. So how did Hillary end up filthy rich? Pay-to-play politics.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump highlights Hillary Clinton's corrupt practices.  We'll check in with Jason Miller, Laura Ingraham, and you're going to meet the mother of a young man who served this country and took six pictures inside a submarine. He's in jail tonight. Hillary Clinton -- she's running for president. Wait until we show you a video. You're going to want to record this and send it to all your friends, straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" So Hillary Clinton's email scandal is not going away anytime soon. Here with the very latest is Fox's own Ed Henry.Ed, this is getting bigger and bigger, and you got the Justice Department versus the FBI versus the White House. There's a war going on there in D.C. I hope you're not a part of it.(LAUGHTER)ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: No, I'm not. But you're right. There are FBI agents frustrated that more was not done earlier, particularly about the Clinton Foundation.A new development tonight -- you heard Republican Donald Trump on the stump citing a report by CBS News that FBI agents in kind of a separate part of this investigation, multiple investigations, as you know, going through the laptop of Huma Abedin. You see her there. She was in Washington tonight at a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton with Anna Wintour, Diane von Furstenburg, as well. And it's interesting because we had not seen her in almost a week out and about. But she's raising money for Hillary Clinton.What the CBS report is saying and what I have from an FBI source tonight is that they are picking up some emails from that laptop that Anthony Weiner had that, basically, Hillary Clinton's name comes up. It's not clear whether there was classified information or not.But why this is significant is that initially, when James Comey came out last Friday and said that he was reigniting this investigation, the Clinton camp tried to spin it and say, Well, Hillary Clinton's is not involved and these are just duplicate emails.This FBI source tonight is saying no, they're getting fresh emails and Hillary Clinton is named at least in some of these emails. So that might heat up that part of the investigation.Then Wikileaks today had several more emails coming out about Hillary Clinton and whether or not she had turned over all of her work-related correspondence. In particular, a March 4th, 2015 email exchange where Clinton aide Jen Palmieri wrote colleagues that Cheryl Mills was close to a deal with the State Department to release more of those work emails.But one adviser replied, if there's a release of the 55,000 pages, are there others that are not being released? Joel Benenson, the chief strategist of the campaign, said definitely.Well, that's interesting because you'll remember also on March 4th in this new email, Mandy Grunwald pressed Palmieri on how they decided which e- mails were personal and deleted. She said, quote, ""Family and friends?  Are Huma, Phillippe, Cheryl, et cetera included in the 55,000 work- related?"" That was what Grunwald was asking. No clear answer there.And the reason why that's a critical question is, you can tie this back to the Clinton Foundation with Huma Abedin, Phillippe Reines, as well as Cheryl Mills, particularly Mills and Abedin. In addition to working at the State Department, where you would think they would have had official e- mails that would been collected and then released, they also were paid by the Clinton Foundation and were doing work for the Clinton Foundation.So as the FBI now looks at this investigation into the Clinton Foundation that Bret Baier's been reporting about the last couple of days, you would think some of those emails from Mills and Abedin would be important because they were basically working for two different entities at the time, Sean, and that would be right at the nexus of what the FBI is trying to get at, which is were there favors being done at the State Department for Clinton Foundation donors?It's something we can't answer tonight. There have certainly been allegations about that. But this gets to the heart of whether Hillary Clinton was telling the truth when she said way back in March 2015 that she turned over all work-related emails, Sean.HANNITY: It's getting more interesting by the day. Ed, great reporting, as always. Thanks for being with us.Joining us now with reaction, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. By the way, Mr. Mayor, as we're coming on the air -- and I just got this report on my email, it literally just broke -- the race for the Oval Office has tightened significantly. The two candidates are tied in Florida, North Carolina, and apparently, Michigan has narrowed so much the state is too close to be called. Ohio is a dead heat and Pennsylvania is only now barely tilting Clinton. This thing is blowing it wide open!RUDY GIULIANI (R), FMR. NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Yes, I just came back from Pennsylvania. I did two events in Philadelphia with the police, the FOP of Philadelphia completely in support of Donald Trump. I don't think there's a policeman in this country that doesn't support Donald Trump, given what Hillary has done to the police, and also their understanding, like the FBI agents who are in revolt, this is a corrupt person. I mean...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: The FBI rank and file...GIULIANI: Look, I told you I think a year ago...HANNITY: Yes.GIULIANI: ... that she violated the laws.HANNITY: Let me put them up on the screen. This is what we call Rudy's list.GIULIANI: I told you a year ago that she violated the laws of the United States, serious laws (INAUDIBLE)HANNITY: These are the specific laws you said.GIULIANI: Everything coming out now completely corroborates what I was saying because it doesn't take a genius to figure out, if you have Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills working for the State Department and the Clinton Foundation, all of a sudden, they became one. The minute they became one, you had a crime because she promised Obama she would keep them separate because it would create a conflict of interest.Now, I looked at the first case that came out. Nobody disputes these facts. I could put her in jail and convict her of this. UBS -- UBS, big bank, they had 56,000 identities they were trying to hide from the IRS.  UBS gave the Clintons $660,000 in contributions to the Clinton Foundation, a $30 million loan to the Clinton Foundation and a $1.5 million speaking fee to Bill Clinton, and they got Hillary to get on that airplane, go to Geneva and try to convince the IRS to lay off UBS.HANNITY: Unbelievable.GIULIANI: The IRS did, and they only got 4,000 of the 56,000 emails.HANNITY: As Bret Baier has been reporting...GIULIANI: That's a bribe!HANNITY: No, that's pay-to-play...GIULIANI: That's a bribe!HANNITY: ... quid pro quo -- that's a bribe. I got it.(LAUGHTER)GIULIANI: Pay-to-play (INAUDIBLE) bribery...HANNITY: It's called bribery.GIULIANI: ... 15 years in jail. I put two congressmen in jail for that.HANNITY: You did.GIULIANI: She did about 10 of these!HANNITY: All right...GIULIANI: I feel bad for the cases that I prosecuted because they were so small in comparison...HANNITY: Did you meet the woman that's...GIULIANI: ... to the massive fraud this woman was involved in.HANNITY: Did you meet the woman in the Green Room? She's going be on later tonight. Her son took six pictures for his own use...GIULIANI: Yes.HANNITY: ... of a submarine! He's in jail for a year! He's got a 1-year- old baby at home!GIULIANI: So we have -- now we have the FBI telling us there's a 99 percent chance that at least four or five foreign countries were able to...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: 99 percent chance.GIULIANI: 99 percent chance, which to me means 100 percent change. Look, if China doesn't have their email, then we don't have to worry about China. If Russia doesn't have their emails, we don't have to worry about Russia...HANNITY: They all have it!GIULIANI: They're a joke. You know...HANNITY: The Romanians have it!GIULIANI: ... they're a complete joke.HANNITY: The Iranians have it. The Russians have it! The Chinese have it!GIULIANI: Look, ISIS has it.HANNITY: That's what I was going to say next.GIULIANI: Yes. Come on.HANNITY: All right, so...GIULIANI: Then they're not worth anything if they don't have it.GIULIANI: But let's put something together here. Remember when the AP did their story, 55 percent of the people, individuals that got access to Hillary were all donors to the foundation.Now, if you look at the Uranium One deal, where Hillary Clinton had to sign off specifically -- now, she was given $31 million by the principal involved. Then he got others to give her millions. And then they were merging with other companies and eventually with a Russian company. She signed off 20 percent of our uranium assets to give back to the people that gave her tens of millions!Then you got the Moroccan deal, which is a direct quid pro quo. Then you've got the Haiti deal. Let's have two separate lists of people!GIULIANI: Yes. This idea that there's no quid pro quo for me for the last seven months, eight months, has been a joke. The Russian deal is probably the worst. What secretary of state in the last, I don't know, since the communist revolution in Russia, would sign off on 20 percent of our uranium going to Russia but one who was bribed?And she was bribed. The people who made money on that were all of Bill Clinton's friends who had arranged a deal with Kazakhstan and the dictator, Nazerbayev (ph) of Kazakhstan, had they made hundreds of millions of dollars, and they gave $30 million of that to the Clinton Foundation, and then they put a lot of money in Clinton's pocket as a speaking fee.That is bribery. No secretary of state since the time that Russia became a communist country through now, with Putin trying to assert himself, would possibly give 20 percent of our uranium to Russia.HANNITY: Nobody would. Nobody would.GIULIANI: And she is making these allegations about Trump and Putin?HANNITY: Which have been disproven.GIULIANI: What a joke! What a complete joke!HANNITY: All right, let me -- last question. Do you think there's any way, with what we know now, short of a pardon, that she gets away without an indictment, considering the Justice Department trying to protect her...GIULIANI: There's no way. There is...HANNITY: The FBI rank and file have now said...(CROSSTALK)GIULIANI: There's one -- there's one way. If in his lame duck status, Obama gives her a pardon. And he should promise the American people that he will not give her a pardon, whether she's elected or not elected.HANNITY: He really should.GIULIANI: He should promise the American people, I will not -- look, he's completely -- between him and her, they have completely corrupted the Justice Department and the State Department. Donald Trump is going to have to put in a reform agenda in both the State Department and the Justice Department, the same way that it had to be done after Watergate.HANNITY: All right, we're going to have to run. Mr. Mayor -- we call it the Rudy Giuliani list now. Its got an official name.GIULIANI: I don't know when I first gave that to you. You got to give me the date.HANNITY: It was about a year...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: ... about a year ago.(CROSSTALK)GIULIANI: I turned out to be right in every single one of them, right?HANNITY: Yes, sir.GIULIANI: And I left a few off.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: Thank you for -- you going to add to the list?All right, up next on this busy news night tonight on ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Clintons, from dead broke to worth hundreds of millions. So how did Hillary end up filthy rich? Pay-to-play politics.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Only five days to go until you, the American people, go to the polls, Donald Trump making sure that every American will know just how corrupt Hillary Clinton really is. Laura Ingraham, Jason Miller -- they'll weigh in.And also tonight, ""Clinton Cash"" author, the guy that got all of this started, Peter Schweizer -- he exposed pay-to-play and the practices with the Clinton Foundation.And you'll also tonight meet the mother I was just talking to the mayor about. Her son is in jail -- in jail! Why? He took six photos for his own use of a classified area, a fraction, a mere fraction of what Hillary did! And by the way, his wife and 1-year-old child are waiting for him to come home a year from now. Straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Clintons -- from dead broke to worth hundreds of millions. So how did Hillary end up filthy rich? Pay-to-play politics.  Staggering amounts of cash poured into the Clinton Foundation from criminals, dictators, countries that hate America. Hillary cut deals for donors. Now the FBI has launched a new investigation. After decades of lies and scandal, her corruption is closing in.DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I'm Donald Trump, and I approved this message.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, a brand-new ad put out by the Trump campaign. Joining us now, FOX News contributor, editor-in-chief of Lifezette, nationally syndicated radio host Laura Ingraham, Trump campaign senior communications adviser Jason Miller.Laura, I'm looking at this breaking news. This is pretty amazing.  Michigan is now in play? This is all the things you and Newt have been saying to me, and here's Mr. Doubting Thomas. You know, I need to put my hand (ph) in the side (ph) because I want to see it on paper first. What do you think?LAURA INGRAHAM, EDITOR IN CHIEF, LIFEZETTE.COM: I think, Sean, that New Hampshire -- I lived there for four years, you know, a long time ago. But they're very independent people. There are a lot of Massachusetts transplants up in New Hampshire. But they don't like being told how they're going to vote. And I think people in New Hampshire get a little tired of the prognosticators with very little factual basis saying that it's over in New Hampshire. It's already leaning Democrat. Same thing with North Carolina and Colorado.We're learning a lot more about the Clintons. Andy McCarthy of National Review said it well when he said that the foundation, it looks like, was operating ostensibly as a charity, but it really was, looks like from these documents, and we'll learn more, operating as a continuing criminal enterprise that was lavishing huge benefits to Clinton cronies, of course the Clintons themselves, luxury travel, advisory board appointments, and of course big speaking fees and access to Hillary Clinton. That is going to be a tumor on the presidency of Hillary Clinton should she be elected.  That is, I imagine, for a lot of people just a bridge too far to take.HANNITY: What do you think, Jason?JASON MILLER, TRUMP SENIOR COMMUNICATIONS ADVISER: I think numbers are moving quick. I think this Clinton, the investigation into the foundation on top of what we're seeing from the State Department I think is big. You look at Mr. Trump's travel schedule. He's kicking off tomorrow. He's going to 11 states in three days. Tomorrow he'll be in Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, turning a lot of blue states or purple states red.  You look at these numbers with the way that they're moving. New Hampshire, that could put us over the top. If Pennsylvania, if we win Pennsylvania --HANNITY: Look, this road is not easy for any Republican. Laura, go back to you. That means that Trump has to win North Carolina. The polls have been tight there. Florida, it's always tight. Ohio, he'll win Ohio I think and win Iowa I think. I think he'll win all four of those, but then we've got to take Nevada, and then we've got to start looking to take all of the states that Romney won. Can he get Colorado? Can he get, as you said, New Hampshire? Is Michigan really in play? Is Pennsylvania really in play or is that a pipe dream?INGRAHAM: I think Pennsylvania for the first time in many election cycles for a Republican is in place because Donald Trump has made this election about the perils of globalization, corruption in Washington, and mass migration, illegal variety, into the United States. That's all converged in a state like Pennsylvania and drastically reduced the standard of living of people there. You throw in the Obamacare premiums, all the new revelations, absolutely.And Sean, I just want to add. It's so serious for Hillary Clinton right now and they're so worried that they have Barack Obama flying everywhere to try to save this for her. He's popular, she's not.HANNITY: Talking about the KKK, that Barack Obama?INGRAHAM: Despicable. And what happened to when they go low we go high?HANNITY: Exactly.INGRAHAM: We go low and then we go lower.HANNITY: Just like he was going to fix the economy, hope and change. Let me ask you this --INGRAHAM: Campaigning for her as hard as he is, I think he's in four states. He has four big events this weekend. And from what I just read, I think Hillary has three big events over the weekend. They'll be in a bunch of different states. She has other surrogates. But I think the damsel is in distress, and it's going to be the big rescue attempt by Barack Obama to try to save this.HANNITY: I wonder if the 13 million more Americans on food stamps since he became president and the 8 million more in poverty since he's become president and the doubling of the debt maybe took a little bit of the hope and change feeling away that people had for him. Playing the race card won't help.Let me ask you one legal question, Laura. This is leading towards an indictment. Do you think the FBI rank and file have so had it with the Justice Department they are not going to allow this case not to be brought before the American people?INGRAHAM: To me the way it's going, you know, my experience in white collar criminal defense, if I were Hillary Clinton I would be really, really worried at this point. It seems like it's pointing that way and pointing that way in a very devastating fashion. You don't have a mutiny at the FBI for nothing, and that looks like what we're on the verge of having.HANNITY: Jason, last word.MILLER: Momentum, everything is coming up Trump right now. You see Hillary has completely given up any type of positive message. All the energy, all the enthusiasm --HANNITY: How disgusting is it that the president of the United States who hung out with unrepentant terrorists, spent 20 years in the church of G-D America, made that accusation today, pretty low? Go high and low, as Laura said?MILLER: It is pretty low, and I think the fact that we're finding all of these emails on Anthony Weiner's laptop is just --HANNITY: Pretty disgusting too. By the way, the president lied to us about that because he said I found out about it from the news media.INGRAHAM: Yes, and the press.HANNITY: Thank you guys.INGRAHAM: Hello.HANNITY: Peter Schweizer when we come back. He was the first person, by the way, to expose this pay to play practice at the Clintons and what was happening at the Clinton Foundation. He'll react to the FBI probe. Plus, tonight --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I often feel like there's the Hillary standard and then there's the standard for everybody else.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's the Hillary standard?(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: You're going to meet the mother, her son now was in the service, now sitting in jail. Why? He took photos for himself of a classified area. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton didn't even get a slap on the wrist for having all of that classified information, top secret information, on an unsecured private server that we have a 99 percent chance was hacked by five foreign intelligence agencies. We'll continue.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We know Hillary can't be trusted. We've learned that. With America's security, you take a look at her email situation, can we trust her with our security?CROWD: No!TRUMP: She is disqualified for running for president of the United States.  She's disqualified.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump earlier tonight. My next guest was the first person to expose pay to play and the practices at the Clinton Foundation, and as our own Bret Baier first reported last night, the FBI is actively, aggressively pursuing an investigation into wrongdoing. Joining us now, the author of the bestseller and the best DVD, ""Clinton Cash,"" Peter Schweizer. Peter, we don't have a lot of time. Explain what you knew and how this is being exposed vis-a-vis WikiLeaks and the FBI.PETER SCHWEIZER, AUTHOR, ""CLINTON CASH"": The book came out April of last year. We had front page stories, ""The New York Times"" and ""Washington Post"" confirming our findings, ABC News. The FBI a few weeks after that got in touch, started making queries. I mean, I actually haven't had that much contact with them. The last contact I had was at the end of February.  They were doing their own investigation. The book was out there. And they've added a lot.I think one of the things that the Clinton camp is trying to spin is that basically they tossed the book on the desk and said here's our case, which is ridiculous. They've done a lot of legwork. They interviewed a lot of people --HANNITY: By the way, you got these hacked -- we now know the media is corrupt. There's not really a Clinton Foundation investigation, which is total nonsense. But they're spinning it -- the Justice Department is leaking to their media pals and the media sops it up like the propagandists that they are. So you knew this investigation was ongoing from when?SCHWEIZER: I've known it from last summer. It's always hard to know on the outside in a sense looking in how widespread it was. But we've had people now from the bureau confirm to news outlets that five offices, Little Rock, Washington, New York, Los Angeles, and Miami have been looking into this in addition to some of their overseas operations.HANNITY: Is there any doubt what they did is bribery pay to play, meaning the uranium deal, or the Moroccan deal, or the list that was created for the Haiti relief fund?SCHWEIZER: No, there's not. Sean, you look at my book and then look at what's come out now in WikiLeaks. You have the internal review done at the Clinton Foundation at Chelsea Clinton's request, done by Simpson Thatcher, a prestigious law firm in New York, and they said that donors, quote, ""had expectations of quid pro quos in exchange of their gifts."" You look at the emails that have come out of Doug Band arranging meetings for donors. You look at --HANNITY: Clinton, Inc. he called it.SCHWEIZER: Yes, Clinton, Inc., exactly.HANNITY: Sad.SCHWEIZER: You look at the ABC News report that to get contracts in Haiti they actually said is this contractor an FOB, ""friend of Bill."" If they weren't, they sent them to some website. If they were, they got special treatment. That's classic pay to play and it's illegal.HANNITY: Great work. I was very proud -- I think I had the first interview with you when the book came out. We've interviewed you many times since. You've done a great job and a great service to your country.SCHWEIZER: Thank you.HANNITY: Thank you.Coming up, you'll meet the mother, her son tonight sitting in jail for taking a photo of a classified area on a submarine. Hillary Clinton is campaigning to be our next president. She should be the one in jail, straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. MIKE PENCE, R-IND.,VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I told Senator Kaine last night if either of our sons in the military handled classified information the same way Secretary Clinton did, they would be court-martialed. I mean that's the hard truth of all of this. And the American people are tired of it.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: They are tired of it, as the Clinton campaign continues to face increased scrutiny over Hillary's mishandling of classified information.  In just a minute you're going to meet the mother of a Navy service member who says her son, Kristian, is definitely being held to a very different standard than the Democratic nominee. My web producer at Hannity.com put this video together. This is their story.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: So we're going to get a special prosecutor and we're going to look into it, because you know what? People have been, their lives have been destroyed for doing one fifth of what you've done. And it's a disgrace, and honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.(MUSIC)CLINTON: I often feel like there is the Hillary standard and the standard for everybody else.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What is the Hillary standard?(MUSIC)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I know Bernie Sanders said that, quote, the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails, but there are a lot of people who are not.(LAUGHTER)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Including FBI officials.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Thanks to my radio team. Kathleen Saucier is here. You were crying during that. I know you've seen it before, but this is your son.  This is his life.KATHLEEN SAUCIER, MOTHER OF KRISTIAN SAUCIER: Yes, this is. And I apologize for being tearful. I thought I was going to hold this together.HANNITY: Why do you apologize? Your son, your grandbaby won't see their father. He took six pictures of his sub, right?SAUCIER: Right. And so we do get to see him, which we're very blessed that we get to see him.HANNITY: In jail?SAUCIER: In prison, yes. So in 2009 there was no cell phone ban on submarines at that time. Technology was you and the Navy hadn't caught up yet. And many of the young men, 22 years old, many of them were taking photos. A couple got caught under the Navy while they were on the submarine and they were reduced in rank and fined $560. Unfortunately my son, his phone was lost and then found outside of the Navy. And then the FBI became involved. And so that was, you know, years ago, and we've come to this point now, flash forward to May of this year after a lot of threats and intimidation towards our family, my son made the decision and financially we just didn't have anything else.HANNITY: Did your son take pictures in the submarines to give to Russians, or did he take it to say, oh, this is where I worked? I'm assuming the latter.SAUCIER: Yes. Yes. I believe he did. I really have no doubt in my mind it was a 22-year-old guy.HANNITY: He is proud of where he worked and he took pictures and cell phones were allowed. Look at these pictures. That is your one-year-old granddaughter.SAUCIER: Yes. He has an absolutely beautiful wife who has stood by him through this, which I'm so grateful for her and her strength and a beautiful one-year-old daughter, yes.HANNITY: I'll put up on the screen all of the offenses Sharyl Attkisson at her website put up. She's a former reporter at CBS. All the things she's done. When you compare the Hillary standard, there it is, all she's done, all that we know, all of the emails that have now been uncovered, national security secrets, top, classified, all of the top levels, and special access programs at the highest level of security on that unsecure email, what do you say to Hillary?SAUCIER: It just disgusts me. I don't understand how the American public cannot see this, that there is a clear double standard. She should be held to the same standard as every other American patriot.HANNITY: When does your son get out of prison?SAUCIER: Next year October.HANNITY: So he's got a whole year to go.SAUCIER: He's got a year to go, and the hard part about it for everyone I think is that everyone says he'll get out early for good behavior.  Unfortunately he won't because he was sentenced to a full year in federal prison.HANNITY: I'm so sorry. Thank you for sharing this story. We're sorry this happened to your son.SAUCIER: Thank you. God bless and please pray for us.HANNITY: We will.""Question of the Day"" is next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Quick ""Question of the Day"" tonight. Do you think the FBI should recommend that Hillary Clinton be indicted based on what we know? Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter.Thanks for being with us. I don't know where my football went. We'll see you back here tomorrow night. Where did it go?  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.TRISH REGAN, GUEST HOST: Breaking tonight, Republican nominee Donald Trump revving up a potential campaign reset in the motor city with a big speech on one of the two key issues that analysts believe could help him defeat Hillary Clinton.Welcome, everyone, to ""The Kelly File."" I'm Trish Regan in for Megyn Kelly tonight. Today Mr. Trump gave a major speech on the economy, a speech that's raising expectations and exciting his base while also raising eyebrows from his opponents. Trump's 60-minute-long speech zeroed in on what we need to do to get our economy growing again in the way of lower taxes for individuals and corporations. Less regulation, better trade agreements, and child care tax credits for working parents.Trump also took aim at the left's economic policies that he says have destroyed the middle class. Now, there were no insults at fellow Republicans today, and Trump refused to let the protesters steal the show, though they tried. The Donald Trump we saw today, the billionaire, the entrepreneur, a man who knows firsthand what regulation does to growth, came across to his supporters as a politician with a stronger, tighter message. A message focused on restarting our challenged economy.  Simultaneously, he went after Hillary Clinton. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The city of Detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent's failed economic agenda. If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better than Hillary Clinton's economic agenda. Hillary Clinton short circuited again.  She accidentally told the truth and said that she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class. Hillary Clinton says her plan will put a lot of coal companies and coal miners out of business. There will be no change under Hillary Clinton. Only four more years of weakness and President Obama.(END VIDEO CLIP)REGAN: Now, in just a few moments, we will speak with Steve Moore, the man who helped right Donald Trump's speech, along with Robert Reich, former labor secretary under President Bill Clinton.But first, let's go to campaign Carl Cameron, chief political correspondent who is in Detroit. Carl.CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Trish. Welcome to Cobo Center in downtown Detroit where Donald Trump today addressed the Detroit Economic Club. A policy wonk oriented organization, and there wasn't a lot of the kind of talk that is customary here, how to reduce the deficit, how to balance the budget, that sorts of things. Instead, it was mostly an enunciation of Trump's goals and priorities. Not a lot of specifics but there was a big revision.He talked about how he would reduce the number of marginal tax brackets from the current number down to three and revised his numbers upward.  Early in the campaign, Trump said that he would have only three brackets, 10, 20, and 25 percent. A dramatic reduction from the current highest bracket of 39 percent taxes. That has now been revised, and Trump says that there will be three brackets, 12 percent, 25 percent, and 33 percent, an increase from what he had proposed, but it puts him in line with House Republicans and Paul Ryan, who have proposed tax reductions with those brackets in those rates.It's a very big deal. Apart from that revision, what really this was today was a speech in which Donald Trump went after Hillary Clinton, saying that she has all of her political life embraced the policies of failure. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Every policy that has failed this city and so many others is a policy supported by Hillary Clinton. She supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your community and the crime policies have made you far, far less safe.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAMERON: Trump reiterated his commitment to make child expenses fully deductible and suggested that he will do away with carried interest, a darling of Hedge Fund and Wall Street bigwigs that's allowed them to escape a lot of taxes. Trump from the earliest stages of his potential campaign said that this was one of the things that he was going to change in order to make taxing more fair -- Trish.REGAN: All right. Thank you so much, Carl. Will Trump's economic and tax plan work? And importantly, will it help him right now with voters.Joining me, Stephen Moore, Trump economic adviser and a FOX News contributor, along with Robert Reich, professor at UC Berkeley. And a former labor secretary under President Clinton. Good to see both of you, guys.I'm going to start with Stephen. Stephen, Trump says lower taxes, less regulation. It will unleash American prosperity. Now, you know I'm a business reporter. I spend a lot of time covering the economy. So politics aside, these are, in most economists' minds, generally healthy ideas for the economy. But how could he do it? I mean you heard Carl hit him on specifics. How could he do it and if he does, what kind of growth are we talking about?STEPHEN MOORE, TRUMP CAMPAIGN ECONOMIC ADVISER: Well, great to be with you, Trish. And by the way, I just do have to make a political point because we all know that the last week was a pretty bad one for Donald Trump. And he needed to swing for the fences today, and, you know, he knocked this thing out of the park. I mean there was an air of electricity in that convention center in Detroit. And there's a reason he gave that speech in Detroit. Detroit really is the embodiment of the failed liberal policies of the last 30, 40 years.Now, you asked the question, can he do it? And the answer is yes. Look, every time we've cut taxes, whether you go back to John F. Kennedy in the 1960s or Reagan in the 1980s, we've had more growth. And by the way, one of the most important points of the economic program that was announced today, you haven't mentioned yet, which is businesses. Small businesses and big businesses will now pay a 15 percent tax. Now, Trish, you know this from FOX Business news. The United States of America has the highest business tax rate in the world.And how many times have you reported on great American companies like Burger King and Pfizer and others that are leaving the United States because our taxes are so high? And we really believe you bring those taxes down and the regulations, you're going to bring a lot of those companies back to Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Illinois, and you're going to regenerate growth. So the way you get the deficit down, Trish, is you build -- rebuild the American economy.REGAN: I know, you're going to grow the economy and therefore -- yes. You know, then you bring in more tax revenue. That's the thinking anyway. But Bob Reich, you have a problem, and always have with this sort of lower tax idea as a way to unleash prosperity. So what is your main complaint?ROBERT REICH, LABOR SECRETARY UNDER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Well, first Trish, let me say something very positive. I want to salute Stephen Moore for his handiwork, his fingerprints were all over that Trump speech today, and Stephen, what you did is you walked Donald Trump away from the abyss of sheer lunacy back toward the normal --MOORE: Thank you, Bob.REICH: Normal nonsense of supply-side, trickle-down economics.REGAN: All right. We can count on Bob for that, anyway.(CROSSTALK)REICH: I think that's real progress. I mean, look it, this is basically what Paul Ryan has been urging. Donald Trump is now lining himself up with Paul Ryan. And the problems with it are a couple. These are the classic problems with supply-side, trickle-down economics. Nothing trickles down.  You don't really change the average, you know, working person's life. You just give huge tax benefits to the wealthy, and also you very often end up with huge deficits. Now, we've seen this again and again, Trish. And I'm not saying anything that's new. But I am speaking as somebody who was the labor secretary in Bill Clinton's administration, and the Clinton years were pretty good. I mean, 22 million new jobs.REGAN: With all due respect. Bob is right. One of the problems with our current economic situation is, you know, whether you want to go after trickle-down economics, you can look at the current situation and know that it actually hasn't worked. I mean Stephen Moore, you look at the jobs picture right now and, yes, unemployment is decreasing. But the reality is nobody is making any more money. In fact, wages, they have been stagnant for 20 years. When you look at the opportunity that people have now, it's not the same as it was 30, 40, 50 years ago. So, you know, I'd like you to answer Bob here, as he says, this trickle-down theory, it doesn't work. It won't.MOORE: Well, a couple of things. I mean, first of all, it certainly hasn't worked what we've done over the last seven-and-a-half eight years.  I mean, we've had the weakest recovery since the great depression.  Americans haven't had a pay raise now. This is the first time we've had a recovery, so-called recovery from a recession where middle class families didn't make any ground. In fact, they've lost some ground in this recovery. And the real unemployment rate, as Donald Trump said today, I mean the biggest joke in America is that we have a five percent unemployment rate.It's closer to 10 to 15 percent when you include all these people out of the workforce. So, we believe that by lowering taxes on business and getting the regulations off businesses, you're going to grow the businesses, Bob. And once you grow those businesses, guess what, they're going to hire more workers. They're going to pay more money. And what I don't understand, Bob, and maybe you can address this. I mean, Hillary Clinton says she actually wants to raise the taxes.She wants to raise the capital gains taxes which is how small businesses are financed. She wants a four percent surtax on small business owners and wealthy people. That's going to take more money out of the businesses.  Bob, how is that going to create more jobs?REICH: Well, just let me say Steve. First of all, Moody's analytics, which is not a left-wing organization -- I mean Moody's analytics looked at Hillary Clinton's plan and said, it would create 10.1 million net new jobs.  And I was in the Clinton administration. We created 22 million net new jobs, not because we reduced taxes. We raised taxes. What did we do? We invested in the American workforce in terms of infrastructure and education. We also made sure that the American income tax credit was expanded. So, most people actually kept more of their income if they were low income people. We made the economy fairer, and we also invested in our workforce -- Steve.(CROSSTALK)That is the way you create jobs.MOORE: Bob, if I actually thought that Hillary Clinton would govern the way Bill Clinton did, I might actually vote for her.REICH: I'm going to quote you on that.REGAN: We'll leave it there, guys. You got a compliment on both sides.  Thank you so much.MOORE: If you look at what happened under Bill Clinton, dramatic reductions in government spending. We did the capital gains tax. We did welfare reform, a lot of those under Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton. And that was when the Democratic Party was moderate. Trish, my problem is that Hillary and the Democrats have moved so far to the left, one of the areas that we're going to talk a lot about in this campaign that Donald Trump talked about was energy policy.REGAN: There's a lot there to talk about. Unfortunately we're out of time. Stephen Moore, thank you so much. Robert Reich, thank you.REICH: Thank you.REGAN: Good to see you guys.All right. It's worth mentioning that at the same time Donald Trump was laying out his vision for making the economy great again, with one of the policies, the Child Care Tax Credit aimed at helping working women, the media was going after Ivanka Trump. Trump's famous daughter known for defending her daughter and for also playing not just a big role in his company but separately, running her own fashion company. So here's what they're getting her on.Apparently her fashion company partners with another company which is under attack for not offering paid maternity leave. The revelation leads the Washington Post to proclaim, ""Ivanka Trump champions working moms, except the ones who design her clothes.""Howie Kurtz, host of ""MediaBuzz"" joins me now with more. And, you know, Howie, I was wondering when they were going to start in on her. Today apparently is the day. But what do you think? Is there anything here to this story, or does it just make for one sexy headline?HOWIE KURTZ, HOST, ""MEDIA BUZZ"": Well, Ivanka is fair game for the press given her role with her father. But this story, I got to tell you, is as thin as hand-me-down lingerie. It's based on one complaint from an unnamed woman. It doesn't involve Ivanka's own clothing company, which offers eight weeks of paid maternity leave and flexible hours for new parents. But a company whose work she licenses, which follows the law by the way, but offers 12 weeks of unpaid maternity leave. So is Ivanka responsible for the personnel practices of everyone she does business with?  I don't think so.REGAN: Well, apparently The Washington Post might think so. But you say that she's fair game. I mean, I just wonder about that. I mean, do we see the left coming out and attacking Chelsea Clinton for whatever issues she might have had along the way? I mean don't you think that there is a little bit of a bias or a reason for them to go after members of Donald Trump's family in a way that we don't necessarily see on the other side, Howie?KURTZ: Well, I don't think she's fair game personally, but in terms of her business record and the fact that, you know, she spoke at the Republican convention. I'm just saying, I don't consider her to be off limits completely. But to come back to the -- my problem with the story, it was so determined to show that this was the sort of a rich girl, a hypocrite because she claims to care about working moms. It had such a condescending tone. It began with her Republican convention speech in a blush tone dress --REGAN: And by the way, 158 bucks? Pretty nice dress.KURTZ: But then the story goes on and on. It dredges up a 1994 quote from Donald about putting a wife to work can be dangerous with reference to his then-divorced wife Ivana. And then finally this to me reminds me, Trish, of the New York post publishing those 20-year-old nude modeling photos of Melania. In other words, it's a way of getting at the candidate by attacking his family.REGAN: All right. Howie Kurtz, thank you so much.KURTZ: Great to see you.REGAN: Ignore for a minute what the media is telling you right now about polls and consider this. What if we were heading into November, and this race was actually literally too close to call?Chris Stirewalt raised that exact question today, and he is here to explain why that scenario is very much a possibility.Plus, a new Republican challenger today announced he is joining the race for the White House, and he's here next.Plus, a dramatic new headache for Hillary Clinton after reports surface that a U.S. spy discussed on Hillary Clinton's unsecure e-mails has now been executed by Iran. Judge Napolitano is in the House. He'll explain.  I'll see you here in two.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)Does the department think and some have even charged that there's a link between that appearance and unclassified e-mails and the prosecution and execution of Dr. Amiri. Does the department see any linkage between the two?(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)REGAN: Developing tonight, about three months out now until ""Election 2016,"" and a new poll from Monmouth University has Clinton at 46 percent support among registered voters compared to 34 percent for Donald Trump.  The Real Clear Politics average points to a slightly tighter race with Hillary at 47 percent and Trump at 40 percent. My next guest says no matter what the media is saying -- and we've heard a lot lately -- a neck and neck race heading into November is not out of the realm of possibility.Chris Stirewalt joins me right now. He's our Fox News digital politics editor. Chris, good to see you.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: How are we doing?REGAN: Walk me through here your scenario. How do you see this playing out?STIREWALT: Well, so far what we see in that Monmouth poll and other polls, this is the low end for Donald Trump. This is the bottom end of his support. He's got a range that's between the mid-30s to the mid-40s, maybe 46, 47. Hillary Clinton has a range too. Her range is from about 50 percent down to the low 40s. So you can imagine a moment if these two candidates stay within these bandwidths that if he's at his high point and she's at her low point three months from tonight on Election Day, guess what? He could win.He could win a narrow election, and that could be very challenging for this country because, remember, a big part of Donald Trump's success is saying that everything is rigged, that the country is a fraud, that things are falling apart, that you can't trust people, and that there's a conspiracy against ordinary folks. If you have -- and that energy is on the left and the right, whether you're Elizabeth Warren or whether you're Donald Trump, that's all out there. If we get into a 2000 Bush v. Gore situation, things get pretty dicey out there.REGAN: I would imagine. Now, let me ask you about polling data and historically how it spent. I mean, there have been recent -- in recent times, situations in which the polling hasn't held up in terms of, you know, say August in 1988, Dukakis was ahead in the polls yet failed to win the presidency.STIREWALT: Well, sure. Just because the polls say something today doesn't mean that's what it's going to be three months from today. We're exactly halfway between Donald Trump clinching the nomination and Election Day. So we're exactly at the hinge point in the election. We're halfway home.  Now, things can change a lot over that period of time, and even if it just stays within that bandwidth it can change a lot. I would remind you -- this is really important. The polls are mostly accurate. Good polls have mostly been accurate, and we have never seen a presidential election blown.  We're looking for the trend lines over the next three months.REGAN: Do you think he helps himself today by getting back to the economy as his main message?STIREWALT: It's his best message. It's the things that voters trust him the most on consistently. That's his best place to be. He ought to say there.REGAN: All right. Chris, thanks so much.STIREWALT: All right. As you just heard moments ago, there is a new face shaking up the 2016 presidential race. Evan McMullin is a Never Trump conservative who officially announced his independent bid for the presidency earlier today.And now in a KELLY FILE exclusive, he's telling us why he wants his name on the ballot.Joining me right now, Evan McMullin, a former CIA officer who most recently served as chief policy director for the House Republican Conference.  Welcome, good to have you here.EVAN MCMULLIN, FORMER CIA OFFICER: Thank you, Trish. Good to be here.REGAN: All right. Why are you getting in now?MCMULLIN: Well, I'm getting in now because I firmly believe that both candidates are woefully unprepared and woefully unfit for the responsibilities that they seek. And I think our country is desperate for a new generation of leadership. I think that's clear. Americans are so unsatisfied with the direction of the country, and then to have two candidates whose negatives are so high. There's just a lot of frustration out there.REGAN: But, again, I guess, just question the timing of it because apparently 26 states have already basically closed the opportunity for you to get on the ballot there. So that would make it extraordinarily difficult for you to get the votes that you need to win the presidency.MCMULLIN: Well, a couple of things. First of all, their petition deadlines may have passed, but there are other means to get on those ballots. So, let's just say that. I've got a great team, they've been studying this for months. And through a variety of means, we expect to be on a broad number of ballots and to compete, and to compete to win. You know, with regard to the timing of this, yes, it's not ideal. In fact, for months, I as well as many Americans have not longer hoped that someone with national name I.D. would step up and do what I'm doing. I believe that this is the last moment when somebody can offer credibly still an alternative to these two unfit candidates.REGAN: So you're a lifelong Republican.MCMULLIN: I am. I would say I'm a lifelong conservative before that.REGAN: Okay. Are you okay, then, with Hillary Clinton getting elected?  Are you okay with your taxes going higher? Are you okay with her picking the Supreme Court justices?MCMULLIN: Listen, the suggestion then is that I somehow would force her to win. Donald Trump is losing badly already to Hillary. I've just entered the race today. He's doing terribly, and he can't keep his foot out of his mouth. And today --  REGAN: But you just heard Chris say, you know, look it's early. There's still more than 90 days to go. And you know, polls can be meaningless when you finally going to the ballot box. And there are polls out right now that suggest he is actually running quite tightly with her in some states.  So the thinking would be that you might pull away some of those votes, therefore tipping the favor to Hillary Clinton.MCMULLIN: Donald Trump is losing badly now according to the polls, according to the Real Clear Politics average poll, even which is, doesn't necessarily reflect the current situation. And it still shows that he's quite a bit behind. Donald Trump keeps saying terrible things that alienates large swaths of the population. He's wholly unfit. I think in fact he's dangerous to the country. And by the way, he is not a conservative. The idea that Donald Trump is a conservative is a complete farce. He is a conman who pretends to be a conservative.REGAN: Wow! Well, those are some big allegations for someone who doesn't want to see Hillary Clinton elected. Anyway, thank you so much.  Unfortunately amount of time. Good to have you.MCMULLIN: Thank you. I appreciate it.REGAN: All right. Joining me right now to respond to Mr. McMullin, New York Congressman Chris Collins, co-chair of Donald Trump's U.S. House Leadership Committee.Good to have you here, Congressman. You know, he says he's really not going to take votes from Donald Trump, but that's I guess one of the concerns here.REP. CHRIS COLLINS (R), NEW YORK: Well, I don't think he's going to get any votes. I mean, this is kind of a desperate noise in the wind kind of move, Trish. We're not going to pay any attention to this. And I'll say this about the polls, they can't poll energy. The Donald Trump energy -- the reason people are voting for him, he's going to secure the borders, bring our jobs back, defeat ISIS, make America great again, put America first. Hillary Clinton has yet to give a reason why anyone should vote for her. The best she can say is, don't vote for Donald Trump. That's not going to cut it over the next 95 days. And when she steps up in that first debate with Donald Trump, no one is going to be watching an NFL game.America is going to tune in, and Hillary Clinton, who can't take a question from ""The New York Times"" and defend what she's trying to defend -- because you can't defend the indefensible on the e-mails, let alone the foundation and Benghazi, you can go on and on. What I'll say is the polls don't mean a whole lot today. I think we just have to look at the battleground states. We have to look at Ohio, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Florida. Those are the key states. Donald Trump wins those four states, he's our next president. And I think right now --REGAN: If he keeps doing what he did today represented, if he keeps doing what he did today, if he keeps hitting the issues -- and by that, I mean the economy. I mean national security. If he stays on message, can he turn this thing around?COLLINS: Oh, there's no question he can. You know, we had kind of a stumble the last week or so, but I think he's back on message. It is the economy. Eighty percent of the public says the economy is going in the wrong direction. The country is going in the wrong direction. As one of your other folks on the show said, you know, the middle class hasn't had a wage increase in 20 years. More people living in poverty. We need to get the economy moving, and that's going to create the opportunities for wage increases, more jobs.We're going to bring the jobs back from China. We're going to erect some tariffs to make sure we have fair trade. You know, this free trade nonsense just didn't cut it. So, on jobs and the economy as well as talking about terrorism, Donald Trump has the answers. It's a reason to vote for him, and Hillary hasn't yet given a reason to vote for her.REGAN: All right. Representative Collins, thank you so much. Good to have you here.All right. For months, now, everyone, Hillary Clinton has embraced the Black Lives Matter movement. But when police tried to reach out to Mrs. Clinton, her response left them disappointed and shock.Sheriff David Clarke and Attorney Eric Guster are here on that next.Plus an alleged spy is referenced in Hillary Clinton's unsecure e-mails.  And then Iran kills him. Judge Andrew Napolitano is just ahead.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Does the department think that -- and some have even charged that there's a link between that appearance and unclassified e- mails and the prosecution and execution of Dr. Amiri. Does the department see any linkage between the two?  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)REGAN: Developing tonight, Hillary Clinton dealing with new controversy concerning police. While the Democrats went out of their way to include cops on stage at the end of last month's convention, when the cameras weren't rolling and America's biggest police group approached the Clinton camp about endorsing her for president, Clinton says thanks but no thanks. Trace Gallagher reports from our West Coast newsroom, Trace.TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Trish, the National Fraternal Order of Police says it has about 335,000 members, about half of the police officers in the U.S. and the way the presidential endorsement system works is that each candidate fills out one of their questionnaires. The answers are then distributed to members and the various state chapters vote. If two-thirds of the chapters agree on a candidate, the union will endorse.It was Bill Clinton in '96, George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004 and John McCain in 2008. Neither Mitt Romney nor President Obama got the two-thirds needed in 2012. But Hillary Clinton apparently won't even fill out the questionnaire. The union feels snubbed saying the Clinton campaign indicated right up until the deadline that she would seek the endorsement. The union president says, quoting, ""You would think with law enforcement issues being so much in the news, even if she had disagreements with our positions, she would have been willing to say that.""The union has also criticized the Democratic Party for being more focuses on deaths caused by police than officers killed in the line of duty. When asked about the endorsement, the Clinton campaign side stepped, saying, quote, ""Hillary and her team have engaged law enforcement throughout the campaign to listen to ideas and solutions, and she will continue to do so as president.""Clinton has gained the support of mothers of the Black Lives Matter Movement and has actively courted the Black Lives Matter Movement, but the founder of BLM says the Clintons, ""Use black people for votes but then don't do anything for black communities."" Donald Trump is actively seeking the police union endorsement. The last candidate to snub the union was John Kerry back in 2004.REGAN: All right. Thank you, Trace. So why would Hillary snub the police? Joining us now, Sheriff David Clarke of Milwaukee County Sheriff's office, and Eric Guster, an attorney and political commentator, welcome to you both. Dave, I'm going to start with you. Sherif Clarke, you know it seems to me you want every vote you can possibly get, right? I mean, why would she not want those of the police?DAVID CLARKE, MILWAUKEE COUNTY SHERIFF: Especially from a fraternal organization of police. Look, everybody that runs for elected office, state, local, federal level, they know they have to have and they seek out aggressively support of first responders, police, sheriff's deputies, firefighters, corrections officers, so on and so forth. Even her husband, who is a better politician on his worst day than she could ever hope to be on her best day, two times sought the support of the fraternal order of police and received it in '96.He was like a kid in a candy shop. Here is what he said, ""For four years I've worked hard to stand with police officers of America and I'm profoundly honored that they have decided to stand with me for four more years."" He understood the importance of that. She has had nothing but utter contempt for the American law enforcement officer. This is just another thumb in our eye. She's engaged the law enforcement community, but she's done nothing but slander our reputations.REGAN: That quote that you just read from her husband, it was, I should point out, at a different time when we didn't have Black Lives Matter taking to the streets. And Eric, could we actually be looking at this and saying this was, in fact, a very calculated political move? In other words, she did not want to be associated with the police because it's too important for her to have those Black Lives Matter votes?ERIC GUSTER, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: No, that's not the case, Trish. Hillary Clinton has reached out to police officers as well as people on the social justice movement and it's not just about Black Lives Matter. This is about getting police to be held accountable for the things that some of the bad ones do. And police officers have to start coming forward to report these bad police officers.Now, back to Hillary Clinton and her endorsement, this is just a union. She's not saying, I don't support the police, but he does support the police. She said it hundreds of time on the campaign trail that she supports their actions.TRISH: But Eric, she didn't even try -- she didn't even try to get their endorsement. She clearly didn't seem to want it.GUSTER: No, they vote in September, so she still has time to get the endorsement, Trish.TRISH: No, the cutoff is over. The deadline came and went. She missed the deadline. She never moved forward. They invited her to do so. And, Sheriff Clarke, she declined the opportunity. Do you think that in fact she's being politically calculating? In her view, she does not want to be associated with the police because therefore that would destroy her support among many members of the African-American community?CLARKE: Well, sure. She's all in with the criminals. You know, her compassion for criminals is not shared by mainstream America. Most of the American public, a large segment of the American public stands on the side of the American police officer. She knows she has to have a heavy volume of black votes to even contend in this election, but she's not going to outdo Barack Obama, who had a record number in both 2008 and 2012.And if Obama hadn't outdone himself in 2012 with a new record high for black voters, he would have lost to Mitt Romney. She has no connection emotionally to the black community, and that's why she has to go all in and leave no daylight in her contempt for the American police officer.REGAN: And look, the black community is clearly struggling right now as we look at crime rates, we look at unemployment, and you look back over the last eight years. And if I were an African-American voter right now that might have been thinking about voting for a Democrat, I think I'd have some serious questions, Eric, because I would want some change. And I don't know if she quite can deliver that or at least in her message, she's not offering that. Does she need to emphasize more change?GUSTER: Trump isn't the change. As long as Trump keeps on the downward spiral that he's going on, she doesn't need to reach out to the FOP. He has lost so many endorsements from GOP leaders that it is shameful for a GOP candidate to lack that type of endorsement. And what Trump is doing, he is dividing our country. And what Hillary Clinton is trying to do is bring us all together.She's not saying, I'm all for one side or the other. She wants to bring both sides to the table and let's talk about community actions. Let's talk about making sure the police -- that bad police are held accountable for the things that they do, but also we need to improve our communities as well. So, she's trying to be a healer when Trump is a big divider.REGAN: You know, it's just tough when you're running on a record in the last eight years, I should think. Thanks so much guysGUSTER: Well, Trump is running it into the ground.REGAN: Good to have you guys here. Potentially damaging new fallout from Hillary Clinton's e-mail server scandal. A reported U.S. spy who was discussed on her unsecure e-mails has been executed by Iran. Judge Andrew Napolitano is here on where this could all go next. And just when you thought the story of the ""Clock Boy"" was over, new drama tonight surrounding him and his school district that led to a lawsuit.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)AHMED MOHAMED, ARRESTED FOR BRINGING A SUSPICIOUS CLOCK: I lost a lot of things. I lost my home. I lost my creativity because before, I used to love building things, but now I can't.(END VIDEO CLIP)REGAN: Developing tonight, the Obama administration ducking new fallout from the latest twist in Hillary Clinton's ongoing private server scandal. Iran announcing the execution of Shahram Amiri, an alleged spy whose fate was discussed over Clinton's vulnerable e-mail system way back in 2010. Yesterday, Senator Tom Cotton said this goes to show how Mrs. Clinton gravely mishandled American secrets.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TOM COTTON, R-ARK.: The e-mails that were on Hillary Clinton's private server, there were conversations among her senior advisers about this gentleman. That goes to show just how reckless and careless her decision was to put that kind of highly classified information on a private server. I think her judgment is not suited to keep this country safe.(END VIDEO CLIP)REGAN: Now today, the State Department wouldn't say if Mrs. Clinton's e- mails led to the scientist's death. Watch.(BEGI VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dr. Amiri was referenced in the e-mails of former Secretary of State Clinton.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mm-hmm.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Does the department think that, and some have even charged that there's a link between that appearance in unclassified e-mails and the prosecution and execution of Dr. Amiri? Does the department see any linkage between the two?ELIZABETH TRUDEAU, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: So, we're not going to comment on what may have led to this event.(END VIDEO CLIP)REGAN: All right. In just moments, we're going to speak to Judge Andrew Napolitano who thinks Hillary Clinton may have jeopardized national security. But first, let's go to Chief Washington correspondent James Rosen, who is in Washington with the details on this, James.JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Trish, good evening. The Islamic regime said it executed Shahram Amiri because he gave the U.S. vital information about Iran's nuclear program while he was here in the states under bizarre circumstances. Back in June 2009, Amiri disappeared during a pilgrimage to Mecca.He surfaced a year later posting internet videos in which he claimed ultimately to have been abducted by the CIA, taken to Tucson and tortured and that he was free and safe. Here's what Secretary of State Clinton said about him at the time.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Mr. Amiri has been in the United States of his own free will, and he is free to go. He's free to go. He was free to come. These decisions are his alone to make.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: Amiri made it to the Pakistani embassy in Washington and there demanded to return to Iran, which he did. Even in announcing Amiri's execution on Sunday, the regime boasted that the U.S. Intelligence community had been duped by Iran.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GHOLAM-HOSSEIN MOHSENI EJEI, IRANIAN JUDICIARY SPOKESMAN: Americans assumed for a while that Iran was not aware of this person's actions or what he was linked to or how he was taken to Saudi Arabia and taken away from there. They imagined that our intelligence was unaware of all of that.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: In July 2010 when Amiri's return to Iran was still being finalized, a top energy adviser of Hillary Clinton's, former Ambassador Richard Morningstar wrote to Clinton's deputy chief of staff, Jake Sullivan, referring to Amiri as a, ""friend to the United States and suggesting how to massage the issue for public consumption. ""We have a diplomatic psychological issue, not a legal issue,"" Morningstar wrote. ""Our friend has to be given a way out.We should recognize his concerns and frame it in terms of a misunderstanding with no malevolent intent and that we will make sure there is no recurrence."" That e-mail was forwarded to the Secretary of State, whose private server was so inadequately secured, the FBI concluded that, ""hostile actors may have gained access to it."" The Clinton campaign says it's remarkable that anyone would link her to this, ""tragic death."" Trish.REGAN: All right. Thanks so much. Here now with more, Judge Andrew Napolitano. And judge, what do you think? I mean did Hillary's e-mail have something to do with this man's execution?ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS JUDICIAL ANALYST: Well, we don't know because he was tried in a court system very unfamiliar to us, and he was convicted. He was sentenced to death. He appealed it. He lost the appeal. And yesterday, he was apparently hanged. We do know that he did provide us with a lot of information. We do know that American intelligence agencies paid him a good deal of money. He was a classic spy.He provided information that was fed to Secretary Kerry, who had it in the back of his head or in his notes at the time he was negotiating with his opposite number that produced the Iranian accords. Whatever you think of those accords, we had a leg up on them because of this spy who worked for us. Can you imagine -- imagine if this e-mail was used in the prosecution against him, hear (ph) members of the court as evidence that the American Secretary of State, the great Satan, was referring to you as their friend.REGAN: If I were a spy anywhere in the world right now, I'd be pretty nervous knowing that Hillary Clinton's e-mail server was not secure, knowing that she could have said the same about me. You refer to someone as a friend. Are you then in danger?NAPOLITANO: One of the reasons that the -- one of the former leaders of the NSA now in private life suggested that the Democratic National Committee was probably hacked by the NSA is because of the well-known antipathy that the intelligence community has to Hillary Clinton. And that antipathy is based on a couple of things, not the least of which is the reckless manner in which she exposed state secrets, including the names of spies, including the names of moles, including the names of double agents.And some of those people in the intelligence community had their covers blown by Mrs. Clinton's recklessness, and some of those people in the intelligence community, others believe, never came back home because she blew their cover.REGAN: And this is because of the e-mail server, because somebody was able to get access to this?NAPOLITANO: This is because she failed to safeguard state secrets by causing all e-mails to come to her. She didn't write this e-mail that referred to him as our friend, but she was copied on it so, it passed through her non-secure server. Some of information she in turn sent to her friend Sid Blumenthal who had no national security clearance and no security whatsoever on his server, and we know that his server was breached probably by the Iranians.REGAN: And members of the intelligence community believe that there are people that have been compromised as a result.NAPOLITANO: And for that reason, they do not want to see Mrs. Clinton in the White House because they believe she's a danger to national security. And the more she lies about this, Trish, put aside the politics, the more she feeds their fear and antipathy.REGAN: Sure. Judge, good to see you tonight. Thank you so much, sir.NAPOLITANO: Good to see you.REGAN: All right, the saga of the so-called ""Clock Boy"", remember him? It continues. First his homemade clock landed him in hot water with authorities. Then he left the country. Well, guess what? He's back in the USA, and he's filing a lawsuit. The details on that one next.(BEGIN VIDEOC CLIP)MOHAMED: Anytime I walk out of the house, there might be death waiting for me so, the best thing for me is that I have to stay overseas, far away. And I really love the States. It's my home, but I couldn't stay.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)REGAN: Not a ""Kelly File"" followup. It was just about a year ago that a boy got in trouble for bringing a homemade clock to school that some said resembled a bomb. Now, his family is suing, saying the principal, the school district, and the city, they all violated his civil rights. Trace Gallagher reports from West Coast newsroom for us tonight, Trace.GALLAGHER: Hey, Trish. The lawsuit claims the state of Texas and the Irving school district has a history of discrimination against Muslims. So, 14- year-old Ahmed Mohamed and his family are now asking a jury to decide the damages. The family had offered to settle the case for $15 million. The boy, as you'll recall, was arrested last September for bringing a hoax bomb to school. Ahmed claimed he built the clock out of hardware salvaged from his parents' garage and was even applauded by president Obama for his ingenuity and invited to the White House.But critics later claimed the boy never built a clock. Instead, he took the cover off an old clock, exposing the wires, making it look suspicious. Police eventually dropped the charges, but he was still suspended for three days and ended up leaving the school altogether and moving to Doha, Qatar. The family is now living back in Texas, but Ahmed claims it's no longer safe for him to live here. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MOHAMED: There is nothing I can do. I've lost a lot of things. I lost my security. I can't walk out on the streets anymore without having to be covered up because I don't want to get shot because it happens here. And it might happen anywhere.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Ahmed, who the media nicknamed ""Clock Boy"", says he got a lot of support in the beginning, but now it's the hate that really sticks. And we should point out the reason his family has now moved back from Doha, Qatar to Texas is because the family could not find work over there. They were living on food stamps and subsidized housing, so now they're back, and he'll go back to school in Qatar.And we should also point out finally this is still being investigated by the Irving school district, and there is a battle between the state and school district as to whether that investigation ultimately will go public or remain private.REGAN: Now, I love that the family couldn't find work over there, so they're back here, and now they're suing. Trace, thank you so much. We're going to be right back. I'll see you right here.(COMMECIAL BREAK)REGAN: Thanks so much for watching, everyone. I'm Trish Regan in for Megyn Kelly tonight. I'm going to see you again right back here tomorrow night and every day at 2:00 p.m. eastern on the Fox Business Network. Have a terrific night. ""Hannity"" is next.
