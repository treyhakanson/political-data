This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: And this is a Fox News alert. Welcome to this two hour live edition of ""Hannity.""Now, it's been a very big night for Donald Trump. He just took the podium at his headquarters in New York City at Trump Tower. Let's listen in.(MUSIC PLAYING)(DONALD TRUMP SPEECH)HANNITY:  All right, that was Donald Trump addressing supporters after winning all five GOP races tonight.  And on the Democratic side, this was just in, Fox News can now project that Hillary Clinton will beat Bernie Sanders in Connecticut's Democratic presidential primary.  Now Clinton has won four out of five contests tonight.  All right, lot of delegate issues.  Let's head on over to Bill Hemmer.  He's standing by at the big board to give us a big delegate count.  What do we got?  BILL HEMMER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Sean, good evening to you.  On the board now our delegate tracker here has Donald Trump at 950 delegates.  He needs to get to 1,237, magic number.  He's just shy of 300 needed so far.  On the night, Sean, he's won 105 delegates that were up for grabs out of a total of 118, and some of this could change a little bit.  But 105 is a blowout number based on all the estimates prior to tonight.  He swept Connecticut, got all 28 delegates in Connecticut.  He won winner-take-all Delaware, got all 16 delegates in Delaware.  Maryland has 38 delegates on the map tonight.  So far Trump has taken 35 in the state of Maryland.  That may go a little higher.  We'll see, three delegates outstanding.  And he won all 17 at large in the state of Pennsylvania.  So that's where we are at the moment at 950.  So as we go forward now, and we'll -- well, Tuesday, a week from now is Indiana, right?  And you know the Fox polling came out last Friday afternoon.  If it stays this way, Sean, you know, that's another pickup for Trump.  And we can -- we're going to talk more about the Hoosier state in the next seven days than you've heard about in a very long time going back to Gene Hackman as head coach there.Then we'll go to Nebraska the following Tuesday.  It looks good for Cruz.  Same day, West Virginia, looks good for Trump.  Not all 34 but a good chunk of it in West Virginia that day.  Following week, Oregon seems a bit of a split right now between Donald Trump and John Kasich.  We'll see how that continues.  But Trump a slight delegate lead in Oregon.  Cruz has a slight delegate lead in Washington state.  So now we're in the month of June and we'll just tick through this quickly. We believe as it stands today Trump wins winner-take -- excuse me, Cruz wins winner-take-all in Montana.  Cruz wins winner-take-all in South Dakota.  Also that day New Mexico, we did a little calculation the last couple of days.  We think Trump picks up a few more delegates than the others as it stands right now.  And then you're in California -- 172 on the line delegate total.  We think Trump will win 109 in the state of California.  That same day now, over here on the east coast in winner-take-all New Jersey.  So he's at 1,164. He would be 73 shy of the magic number of 1,237.  And winner-take-all New Jersey at 51 would put him at 1,215 making him 22 delegates shy.  Now, already tonight, Nate Silver has been crunching the numbers among the 54 delegates in Pennsylvania that are free agents, basically.  Sean, if you go to the list on his website, they have the winners from the delegate face-off tonight in Pennsylvania.  Of those 54, a total of what appears to me as I count them up, 36 of the 54 have said they'll either vote for Trump on the first ballot or they will vote for the person who won their congressional district.  So let's drill down a little bit and see on the results page here just what happened in these five states tonight, OK?  Trump is in purple.  This is Rhode Island with the county map.  Trump 64 percent, 99 percent reporting.  This is Connecticut tonight.  Trump's in purple, 58 percent, 82 percent reporting.  This is Pennsylvania, few counties outstanding, four more to fill in at the moment -- 72 percent of the vote outstanding -- is in, rather.  Trump's at 57 percent.  This is the state of Maryland tonight, and this is Delaware.  So far he has won every county in every state that had a primary tonight, five for five.  And a clean sweep not just of the states, Sean, but of the entire counties in these five areas.  I mean, that is extraordinary.  And I don't know anyone in this business or in politics or in the country who made that prediction prior to the vote today.  That's just -- I mean, that's what you call a clean sweep with a capital ""C"" and capital ""S"" all the way.  Now, how does Trump make the argument for winning in a general election?  If you look at some of the geographic regions in the country so far, he's won up here in the northeast.  We've marked that.  New Hampshire, and then down here in Massachusetts, he's at 35 percent in New Hampshire, just shy of 50 percent in Massachusetts a while back.  Down here, so that's the northeast.  Deep South is Mississippi.  Next door, Alabama.  Trump has won in both states down there as well, and a few others in between, granted, but I'm just making the point about geography here.  And out here in the southwest in Arizona, 47 percent of the vote in Arizona.  Up here in Nevada, that's Clinton/Sanders -- Hillary Clinton beating Bernie Sanders by five points.  On the Republican side in the state of -- let me try and get -- hang on one second here.  We'll try and get this thing.  It was cooking with gas there for -- OK.  Here we go.  (LAUGHTER)HEMMER:  Trump, you know, 46 percent of the vote.  You see the point.  You see the argument he's building here for this general election.  I know you've got Newt coming up here in a moment here.  Sean, one other thing here, and I'm very curious to get his take and yours as well.  Trump is going to make the argument that he can win in states like Pennsylvania, and after tonight you're like, wow, maybe he can.  He's talked a long time about that he could win in the state of New York.  Maybe he can.  But if you look at the primary raw vote total from week ago in New York, the Democrats had 1.8 million votes cast.  Republicans had 800,000.  That's a 1 million vote spread.  In Pennsylvania I was just looking at the numbers, about 60 percent of the total vote in between Republicans and Democrats, and there's still a couple hundred thousand more raw votes on the Democratic side than the Republican side. If you're going to make the case you need a better turnout in November.  That's just the point on that.  So there's a lot more to get into.  We'll go to the look ahead and we'll change some things up here and show you if Trump does not do what we said what the scenario could be, Sean.  HANNITY:  Bill, we'll get back to you.  But think about this.  So we have New York, we have about, what, 92 out of 95.  Tonight, 105 out of 118 bound delegates.  Then we've got the 54 unbound delegates, and we'll be going back to Bill Hemmer all throughout the night in finding out what happened with those.  I put up, Bill, as we talked about last night on my web page, those delegate names on the ballot in Pennsylvania and whether they were supporting Trump, Cruz, or Kasich.  So we should have more of those numbers coming in as well.  All right, so we'll get back to Bill Hemmer at the big board.  Now, before we go, quick programming note.  Tomorrow, my friend, my colleague, Greta Van Susteren, she is going to be hosting a town hall with Donald Trump in Indiana, the next big state one week from tonight.  If you happen to live in and around Indianapolis, you want to go to tomorrow's event, just go to Gretawire.com and find out how.  Now coming up, we're going to have a lot more live reaction to tonight's results.  We have Newt Gingrich, Laura Ingraham, also later, Governor Mike Huckabee, and much, much more.  Stay right there.  We'll continue.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  Welcome back to ""Hannity.""  A big night for Donald Trump after he won all five GOP primary contests tonight.  Here with reaction, former speaker of the House, Fox News contributor, Newt Gingrich.  Mr. Speaker, I know we delayed your appearance here tonight.  I appreciate you bearing with us.  Look at the numbers Bill Hemmer just gave us -- 105 of 118 available bound delegates tonight.  Then you've got 54 unbound delegates of which many have said and pledged that they will support Trump or the winner of their district.  It looks like most of Pennsylvania went that way.  So you got Trump very clearly approaching 1,000 tonight in terms of delegates.  You said in your newsletter that tonight would tell us a lot.  How to you interpret tonight's results?  NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I think, look, it's an even bigger sweep than I expected.  I think Bill Hemmer said that Trump will have carried every single county in all five states.  That is an astonishing achievement.  That means, of course, he's going to get all the congressionally allocated delegates.  Now, so this is a big night for him.  And it raises a very interesting question about the mindset of the news media and the mindset of Washington, which is, what is it you think is going to change when you get to the next big fight?  Why do you think California where Trump is ahead by at least 18 points, what is it that's going to suddenly go sour for Trump?  What is it that's going to go sour for him in Indiana?  And you see the momentum building here.  I think it would be very, very hard, virtually impossible, to stop him from winning the nomination at this point.  And I think it's -- I understand why Cruz and Kasich don't agree, but for everybody else who has looked at the data, this is an enormous achievement building on New York, and it means that he's almost certainly going to have an absolute majority of the delegates before you get to the convention in Cleveland.  HANNITY:  Yes.  And the argument that has been made by his opponents is that it's going to be a contested convention.  Now, after tonight's results, based on -- you're laughing.  I always know that laugh. I've known you since 1990. OK, what?  GINGRICH:  My question, I have friends who talk about a contested convention, if Trump comes out of California and New Jersey at somewhere -- I think Bill Hemmer had him about 1,250 at that point.  Now, what's the contest?  He won.  And the challenge then for the Republican establishment is to get over it.  HANNITY:  I want to pick it up there.  This is the back of the show -- the back of the hour.  We're going to have a nice, long segment with you.  We'll reset at the top of the hour.  We'll have a lot more reaction from Newt Gingrich to tonight's results, also talk about Hillary Clinton, a potential matchup.  Laura Ingraham is with us, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Eric Bolling, Willie Robertson, Hemmer at the big board.  Two hour special live edition of ""Hannity"" continues, and please stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  And welcome back to this special two-hour edition of ""Hannity.""  We'll get back to Newt Gingrich in just a few minutes.  We have Laura Ingraham coming up, but as you can see, we're back at the Bill Hemmer big board.  I want to go particularly, 105 of 118 delegates so far.  That might change tonight.  HEMMER:  Could be a little higher but not by much.  HANNITY:  Not by a lot.  HEMMER:  Could be.  I'm -- could he hit 110?  He could.  I think the Trump people thought, even today, if they were 80 or 90, that would be a blowout night.  HANNITY:  But this is --HANNITY:  Not what they expect.I want to go to Pennsylvania.  I want you to explain one more time, because Trump won the state of Pennsylvania.  So he got 17 delegates for winning the state.  HEMMER:  Right.  HANNITY:  Now, there are 54 unbound delegates.  People of Pennsylvania actually voted for delegate names not associated with the candidates.  Tell us what this --  HEMMER:  And what the Trump team did in the final week is they put a list out of delegates who would vote for Trump on the first ballot in Cleveland.  You can see that on the ballot, by the way.  You can see that name if you were paying that close attention.  HANNITY:  This is interesting because this might be the first example. They brought in a new team specifically for delegates.  HEMMER:  Could be.  HANNITY:  And Paul Manafort.  Are we saying maybe that --HEMMER:  I think so.  I was just watching this tick behind you.  I think he'd make a good point about that, too.  And I can't say for sure.  Maybe that is in the works.  But it appears you might be right.  And Pittsburgh, 90 percent of the vote --  HANNITY:  Go do Philly.  What do we got in Philly?HEMMER:  Philly down here obviously in the southeast, this is Delaware County.  This is Philadelphia.  These are the counties around the city and he's at 57 percent.  You come out here to Montgomery County, almost 50 percent.  Pop down here to Chester County, plus 44.  HANNITY:  Let's go the three counties.  Do we have any numbers coming back in from those three outstanding, nothing at all?  HEMMER:  Yes.  The ones you can see in gray are information is not in.  I'm not quite sure what is going on there.  That was a huge rally in Pennsylvania yesterday.  That was right around, let me get it right there, just southwest of Scranton.  HANNITY:  We've got have to take a break.  We're going to come back.  We have Bill Hemmer at the big board all night.  We'll be watching the delegate count very, very closely.  We also have Newt Gingrich, he'll come back, full analysis, what this means for the state of the Republican Party. Is there a contested convention or not?  Laura Ingraham joins us.  We have our panel, Willie Robertson, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Eric Bolling, and so much more as we continue tonight on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  Welcome back to this two-hour live edition of ""Hannity.""  Donald Trump, he goes five for five in tonight's primaries.  And back with us now for reaction, former speaker of the house, Newt Gingrich.  I just got a lot of e-mails.  I think you said, they're going to have to get over it, meaning the establishment.  Do you think they're having a hard time dealing with this insurgency here?  GINGRICH:  Look, I think somebody could have a profitable business just having Trump adjustment classes.  (LAUGHTER)HANNITY: There are psychology classes for those suffering under Trump, I guess, victory syndrome in cases.  GINGRICH:  You look at the data, and look, there are a lot of things I disagree with Trump about, both on policy and on style, but you look at the data, you look at the degree to which he has assembled millions of Americans, creating a really new movement that is much more aggressive, much more inclusive, and nobody thought he could do it.  So when I hear all the people who were wrong for the last year tell me their newest idea, my first question is, why would I have believed them now when they have clearly not known what they were talking about for a full year?  And that's why I think this is absolutely one of the most amazing experiences in American political history.  And as a historian and as somebody who's been a pretty reasonably successful politician, I am absolutely fascinated by what we're living through.  HANNITY:  He said in a speech tonight that Hillary would be easier to beat than any of the Republicans he went up against.  Now, in hypothetical head to head match ups, the most recent one that's 46-43 within the margin of error, others have had Hillary in the lead -- do you think he would beat Hillary Clinton?  GINGRICH:  Well, I think he would beat her, and second, my point would be, why would we think any of us understand what a Trump general election campaign will be until we see it?  He's going to turn with the same energy, the same drive, the same risk-taking, he's going to follow his own gut.  He's not going to follow Paul Manafort, he's not going to follow Lewandowski, he's not going to follow anybody -- Chris Christie, who he may admire a great deal, but Trump got to this point in his life with a very intense focus on his intuition, his gut instincts, his willingness to gamble, and my guess is that he would run a campaign against Hillary unlike anything we've ever seen a Republican do, at least since Theodore Roosevelt back in 1904.  It would be so inclusive, so aggressive, and have so many appeals to people that you normally never hear from a Republican, that I think it would really be fascinating.  HANNITY:  Let's talk about Donald Trump tomorrow.  He's giving a foreign policy speech, from what I understand, this is going to be the real deal, a real speech, sort of like what he gave at AIPAC.  We heard him tonight for 35 minutes.  Evaluate his tone, his pitch, his cadence.  The things that he was saying sounded optimistic.  I'll bring jobs back, businesses aren't going far away, I will be competitive, I will make better trade deals, we will make America great again.  GINGRICH:  Well look, I think if people would -- when I say people, I mean the Washington elites and the New York elites -- if they would drop their assumptions about who Donald Trump is and actually listen to him for a while, this was a pretty sophisticated conversation tonight.  You may disagree with him about certain things.  I supported NAFTA back when he passed it.  So obviously I have some defensiveness there, but he's making a sophisticated argument about the nature of the world.  His statement about nuclear weapons is exactly right -- you have you to be idiotically out of touch with reality to think that global warming is as dangerous as nuclear weapons, and Trump in that sense is a much more realistic person about national security than the current commander in chief.  So I listen to him and I was actually impressed.  And I think, correct me if I'm wrong, Sean, and you and I have been kidding about this now for two months -- I think he got through the evening without one lying Ted.  HANNITY:  Well, we did get a couple of crooked Hillary's in there.  GINGRICH:  But that is all right, that's the next fight.  I just want to get him out of the last fight.  He won the last fight.HANNITY:  Well, that's an important point you're making in this sense -- if you follow social media, the antipathy, the anger, the hostility, the rhetoric going back and forth, Cruz supporters hating Trump supporters, Trump supporters hating Cruz supporters, it's been as intense as any election I've ever followed in my life, and we've been through a couple together, and I was emceeing the night you became speaker of the house in 1994 -- does that go away?  For example, I would expect if I'm a Cruz supporter, I'm saying, we're going to Indiana, we're going to California, we're going to New Mexico and we're fighting.  GINGRICH:  They have every right to fight all the way to the end.  Football teams don't stop in the third quarter.  Basketball teams don't stop with three minutes still on the clock.  They have an obligation, totally legitimate to the campaign.  I'm saying as an outside analyst, I don't see how they get there, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't try.  The burden, and this will be interesting to watch -- the burden is about to shift onto Donald Trump's shoulders.  He is, as he said tonight himself, the presumptive nominee.  Now that means the guy has got to unify the party.  It ain't Ted Cruz, it ain't John Kasich, not Reince Priebus.  The guy has got to unify the party as the presumptive nominee, namely, Donald Trump.  HANNITY:  I asked you a question on radio today.  I want to repeat the question, not to hear myself talk, but we had 17 really impressive people start this process.  Governor Perry, Governor Bobby Jindal, John Kasich's record in Ohio, if he doesn't get it, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker, Carly Fiorina -- I can go through the whole list, then we could add people that didn't run like Nikki Haley and then maybe some others.  Would it be wise, would it be smart to maybe put a coalition together, announce to the country, this is going to be my vice president, my secretary of state, my secretary of defense, Dr. Carson, Health and Human Services -- would that be a wise, maybe unconventional idea from an unconventional candidate that could work?  And Ted Cruz to the Supreme Court?GINGRICH:  Look, it's certainly worth considering, and I agree with you.  I thought that this was the greatest depth of capability that we have seen in a Republican nominating process in my lifetime.  You look at the total 17, that was a remarkable level of talent that started down this road, and Trump can take some satisfaction in the notion that he's still standing.  There were a lot of first rate personalities out there, any one of whom you would have thought had a fair shot at winning this thing, and he just gradually outgrew all of them, out-argued all of them, turned out to have skills none of us thought he did, and a lot of this -- it certainly, to me, is a big surprise.  As you know, we've known Donald a good while.  I had no idea he had this level of talent and this ability to put together a majority.  HANNITY:  To be very fair, though, even though the last Fox poll had Trump up by eight in Indiana, in the previous poll, up by six, you have this alliance that took place between Kasich and Cruz, it didn't get a lot of good, favorable reaction from what I saw on social media, but on top of that, there are a lot of reports tonight that Ted Cruz may in fact even announce a vice presidential candidate as a means of bringing energy to his campaign -- you're shaking your head before I finish the question.  Why is that?  We're friends so you can do that, that's fine.GINGRICH:  There are two parts to this.  The first is, you have two guys who are the weaker of the three candidates, bringing weakness to each other because in a year, when people are angry about politics and they're angry about deal making, to be openly, publicly trying to make a deal like this personifies everything people are already mad about.  Second, and I think Trump is exactly right about this -- you don't start thinking about the vice presidential nominee until you have the delegates.  The idea that the guy who's losing is now going to announce his vice presidential nominee doesn't make any sense at all to me because it makes it look like the person is out of touch with reality.  Aren't they aware of the fact that they're not winning?  HANNITY:  Let me go through this last question, and I promise I'll let you go home and go to sleep.  I know you had a long trip back from Europe.  So as of tonight, Trump has won 27 state or territory -- of those contests, he's won 27.  Cruz has won 11.  Rubio has won three.  Kasich won one.  If he falls short, 50 delegates, let's just say, will they be able to take it away from him at that convention?  What would be the reaction if they did?  GINGRICH:  Look, you would have a nationwide movement bringing pressure to bear on Cleveland.  The other side can't offer this, but the other side, remember, right now, is characterized by stop-Trump.  They're not characterized by positives.  They're not characterized by, here's the better future.  They're stop-Trump.  But Trump represents a very profound rebellion against the current political establishment, and those millions of people, the people that are showing up at all of these big rallies, those millions of people are going to do whatever it takes -- you could have an amazing number of people coming to Cleveland if they thought this was going to get stolen.  HANNITY:  All right, Mr. Speaker, thank you for staying with us so late, we appreciate it.  Coming up, a lot more reaction to tonight's primary results.  We have analysis.  Laura Ingraham, Eric Bolling, Willie Robertson is here in studio with his beard and everything.  Also, Kimberly Guilfoyle, they will all join us as ""Hannity"" continues.  Stay right there.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We are really honored by this night and I'm really honored to have hit over 60 in virtually every race with 3 people in the race.  I started off for 17.  I'm down now, I'm winning, and it's over.  As far as I'm concerned, it's over.  These two guys cannot win, there's no path.  So why would I change?  If you have a football team and you're winning and then you get to the Super Bowl, you don't change your quarterback, right?  So I'm not changing.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  All right, Donald Trump, earlier tonight, addressing supporters after he swept all five Republican races.  Here now with reaction, editor in chief of lifezette.com, Fox News contributor, Laura Ingraham.  Is he the presumptive nominee in your opinion?  LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I'd say yes.  I know everybody is spinning out these fantasies that Indiana is going to change momentum, and then we're going to go to California and Cruz and Kasich together are going to peel away dozens and dozens of districts.  I mean I guess that could happen, anything could happen, but I think if it were anybody but Trump, the party would be rallying and people would be basically wrapping this up.  I don't want to take away anything away from Ted Cruz.  He's run a fantastic campaign, and I guess if there's a landslide movement in Indiana, a real scene change for some reason, and I don't know what it could be, it could change, but right now, in my home state of Connecticut, I can tell you, the people who are contacting me today and tonight from Connecticut are saying, finally, we have someone who speaks for us.  And they're telling me they have not felt that way since 1984.  These are my family, friends, high school friends, college friends, Rhode Island, Connecticut, you know, not too far away in Maryland -- this is a profound thing, and I know a lot of the never-Trump people are upset and I get that and they're maybe somewhat bitter tonight, but --HANNITY:  Do you think they hold to that, though?  In other words, I have never liked never-Trump, never-Cruz.  I've never liked the in-fighting.  I don't like hostility on social media.  Do you think they stand there when they're going to compare and contrast whoever the Republican candidate is?   All right, Trump now, really, if you look at, he's won 27 contests.  Cruz won 11, impressive wins on his part, but after tonight, Trump will have about 3 million more votes than Ted Cruz, his next closest competitor.  Indiana is certainly not over.  Indiana, you've got to get to 1,237.  Cruz is going all in there.  You see the Kasich-Cruz alliance.  Do you see any path for preventing Trump from getting that number?  INGRAHAM:  Yes, there's a possible path, but when we're reading pieces tonight, Sean, that Kasich's allies on the ground in Indiana, his people, his grassroots, are now in rebellion, according to POLITICO, about this deal -- they're like, wait a second, we just spent the last ten months pounding the pavement for you and now you're telling us we have to be quiet and not speak publicly on your behalf?  So I think it was maybe the only play they had to do this deal that's kind of not even a deal, I guess it's the only play they had, but so far, I just think it's gone over like a lead Balloon.  My callers today on my radio show were just over the top, including a lot of Cruz supporters, and they called and they said look, my whole family is for Cruz, but this is the last straw.  I mean, I can't tell you how many callers I -- just today, in Indiana, who called in to say that, and that struck me.HANNITY:  What's fascinating is the millions of more Republicans that have come out this year than in '08 and 2012.  Republican Party always talks about wanting to expand their base.  Clearly, their base is being expanded.  Certainly issues that have not been discussed as passionately in previous elections involving issues of trade and immigration and building a wall and other issues -- seems to be resonating.  Blue collar workers seem to be coming back.  Reagan Democrats seem to be coming back to the party, but yet the establishment seems to want no part of that.  INGRAHAM:  I just think that what we see now is that the conservatives, and those are mostly represented by Cruz, and the populous, are dominating the Republican Party.  Bushism is over.  That's gone.  That's just been totally rejected.  There is no audience for Bushism, period.  No audience at all.   So this is a great moment.  People should savor this moment.  All of our friends that we really love, we love these people who write for national review and other folks, and I know they're mad, but I'm going to say to them, the life for conservatism will be much worse if Hillary becomes president of the United States, because the party splits in two at the convention, Sean, and it's for television cameras to see a disaster at the convention.  If we go into that convention without unity, it's over.  Hillary wins this race, we've lost the Supreme Court for our lifetime, and I think if Trump and Cruz can somehow come together at the end of all of this and we can bring this party together, I think the sky is the limit. New England just voted for a populist conservative tonight.  New England. I grew up in Connecticut.  I lived in -- my family is from Massachusetts and Rhode Island.  I lived in New Hampshire.  There is a populist wave sweeping this country and it's real, and to reject it and to dismiss it and to demean it is not going to get these conservatives any policy victories that they want.  I think conservatism and populism have to work together for the betterment of the country.  We have to put our egos in the back seat.HANNITY:  I have to let Laura go, otherwise she's going to get arrested.  If it happens, I promise I'll -- she only knows what I'm talking about here.  This is the real deal.  We don't want Laura Ingraham arrested, but I will come, I'll bring a cake with a file in it, that's a promise, all right?  INGRAHAM:  Thank you, Sean.  As long as I get off easier than Hillary. Thanks.HANNITY:  Oh yes, OK.  Well, you won't be wearing orange jumpsuit and shoes without laces.  INGRAHAM:  Not my color.  HANNITY:  Before we go, quick programming note, my friend and colleague, Greta Van Susteren, she is hosting a town hall with Donald Trump, it's in Indiana.  Now if you live in and around Indianapolis and you want to attend tomorrow's event, just go to gretawire.com and find out how you can be a part of the audience.  Coming up, our good friends from ""The Five"", Eric Bolling, Kimberly Guilfoyle, and that guy with the beard, well, you know him.  Willie Robertson is here in the house as we continue, straight ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  How do you pick a man, on the second or third or fourth ballot, who has millions, five, six million votes less than Trump, and I'm the one that brought all these people into the party?  That's why the Republican Party is up almost 70 percent from 4 years ago.  And you know what's going to happen?  Those people, at a minimum, they're going to be very upset, very angry, but at a minimum, they're just not going to vote.  Everybody is talking about the party, worldwide how hot the Republican Party is.  Some people used to say (inaudible) -- well, the Democrats are 35 percent down from four years ago.  The Republicans are almost 70 percent up from four years ago.  That's an amazing tribute.  And that's not because of Kasich or Cruz, that's because of me.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  All right, Donald Trump, earlier tonight, after sweeping all five primaries, that is Maryland, Delaware, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania.  K.G., look, we all were factoring this in.  And I'm getting notes from some Cruz people and they're saying, wait a minute, this isn't over yet, this isn't over yet, and people are saying, all right, so let's talk about the path that others might have.  They can't -- neither Kasich nor Cruz can get to 1,237.  They need to stop Trump from getting there. They started the alliance.  How does that work out for them?  KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, FOX NEWS HOST, ""THE FIVE"":  I mean this just wasn't like a sweep, this was a leg sweep.  I mean, he pretty much took everybody out with this, and I think this begins and ends in Indiana, because how can you even try and recover, other candidates, after this kind of momentum, five decisive wins coming on the heels of a huge victory in New York?  So he's definitely got some momentum with them, and then also we saw definite improvement with the ground game tonight as well in PA and getting those unbound delegates, so I think that that is going to be very important going forward and I think the emphasis and addition of Paul Manafort in Indiana will help as well.  HANNITY:  It's interesting, because they really were a skeletal staff.  I've been out on the road with them and it was Trump, and Cory, and Hope, and that was it.  So for the first time, he's actually built a team which all campaigns had earlier on.  Was that a disadvantage, Eric?  ERIC BOLLING, FOX NEWS HOST, ""THE FIVE"":  No.  I think he did a great job.  And Corey and Hope, they brought him there, then they brought in Manafort when they realized they were losing -- there was some delegate leakage when Cruz was going around getting Louisiana delegates, and Colorado and North Dakota delegates, and they realized, oh, we have to tie that up, they're bringing Manafort in, and he does that.  Sean, I've been here for six months, seven months saying, I see the path to 1,237 for Trump.  I'll do it again tonight.  There's a path to 1,237 for Trump.  A couple numbers, very quickly.  Trump points out, I think his numbers were a little off, here are the real numbers.  The Republicans are 64 percent higher turnout this year than 2012.  The Democrats are down 20 percent.  That tells you some Democrats are coming over to vote on the Republican side and he is getting a lot of them.  The anti-Trump crowd, the never-Trump crowd has always said, oh, he's got a ceiling at 30 or he has a ceiling at 40 -- then it became a ceiling of 50.  He just blew right the ceiling of 50 tonight, and an NBC poll had him at 50 percent on the presidential election on the GOP side.  That one, forget those numbers, and here's another one.  Going into tonight, Trump had 2.1 million more votes than Mitt Romney had at this exact same point in time, and at that time, everyone was behind Mitt Romney as the nominee.  HANNITY:  And 2.3 million more than Ted Cruz, who by the way, has had a very impressive run so far, and probably 3 million more after tonight.  BOLLING:  It's 2.95 million more after tonight.  HANNITY:  So go through your path.  How do you get there?  We were going over the polls --BOLLING:  You've done this for how many years, 30, 40, 50 years, right? It's all about momentum.  HANNITY:  Thirty, 40, 50, I'm 95 years old.  BOLLING:  (laughter) The momentum, right?  Politics, momentum, time, and money.  Money's out of the question right now --HANNITY: K.G. is much nicer.  I love that five but I'm really taking sides now.  BOLLING:  We're the same exact age.  So OK, if we've been doing this, let's say 35 years.  Momentum and time now.  He's got all the time in the world, now.  Cruz, time is running out for Cruz, and time is running out for Kasich, but he's -- Donald Trump has momentum.  Indiana, brings him into California --HANNITY:  But the number of states are also profound.  27, we're talking about states, territories that candidates have won, he's won 27, Cruz 11, Rubio 3, and Kasich 1.BOLLING:  If you're an unbound delegate, and there are some 150 of them out there floating around right now, and they see this big mass momentum getting behind Donald Trump, what are you going to do?  Throw your vote up to someone else?  HANNITY:  Let me bring my friend Willie in here.GUILFOYLE:  Get your wagon.  HANNITY:  So I had you and your dad on the show and you were both debating.  He supports Ted Cruz, you support Donald Trump.  If Trump wins, how would your dad react to that?  WILLIE ROBERTSON, CEO, DUCK COMMANDER:  Oh, he'll be fine.  He's already said that he would support Mr. Trump.  HANNITY:  He's not going to vote for Hillary under any circumstances?ROBERTSON:  Yes, he doesn't like what's on the other side of this.  He met with Cruz and they (ph) shot a spot, which I didn't know about, and then I got home and I said what'd you do, and --HANNITY:  By the way, that was a pretty cool spot.  ROBERTSON:  Yes, it was.  Until he said that, you know, we were all backing Cruz.  HANNITY:  And then meanwhile you're the family rebel and you came out --(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  I know you did a prayer around the dinner table.  Any chicken legs being thrown back and forth?  ROBERTSON:  No, no.  He's fine with --HANNITY:  Any duck wings being thrown over there?ROBERTSON:  Whoever it's going to be, he's fine with, and that's how our family works.  We have arguments about it --  HANNITY:  You go around the country --  in many ways you're like a preacher.  And you speak in a lot of churches, you speak to a lot of different groups.  What are people telling you as you go to the different parts of the country?  One of the things that Bill Hemmer was saying at the big board is, OK, Trump is organizing in the northeast, in the Mid-Atlantic states, in the Southern states, out in the Pacific. We'll see in the Pacific Northwest soon enough.  ROBERTSON:  They say I don't look like a preacher.  So that's what they tell me.  This is not a preachery look.  But what I'm hearing is that people really want change.  I do see the anger, but I do see them want something to change really in all of it.  So if you're antipolitician, it's a great year I think to be Trump.  I think Cruz I think just made a big mistake with this alliance thing right here at the end.  I think he was going to have to play it perfect to actually take him on.  I mean, if you look -- if you look back at what Trump has done, he just got into politics.  And here he is, just steamrolling everyone.  And then right here at the end, I think they -- I think it looked weak and I think it's going to -- it didn't help them any.  HANNITY:  You don't think it helped (INAUDIBLE).ROBERTSON:  To team up and then --HANNITY:  But you know, Kimberly, some of the exit polls confirm issues we have all talked about now for a long time.  Pennsylvania, 60 percent of Republicans feel betrayed by Washington Republicans.  That is a massive number.  It's not immigration.  39 percent talk about the economy and jobs.   I keep mentioning every night, we have 95 million Americans out of the labor force, 50 million in poverty, 46 million on food stamps.  57 percent are very worried about the economy.  83 percent believe an outsider is the one that's going to be able to fix it. 71 percent believe the country is in desperate need of change.  How do you interpret that data?  GUILFOYLE:  I think that he's really encapsulated that movement and that feeling, that emotion, that energy, that passion, to see something new in the country.  And those polls and other polls that we've seen after other primary elections really substantiate that.  We see that this an electorate that is ready to move. They're ripe for it.  And he was the guy that came in at the time and was able to connect with them.  And yes, he ran an unconventional campaign, but guess what?  He's right.  He's saying why would I switch up my game?  You know, you go to the Super Bowl with what you know, how it works, and what moves you (INAUDIBLE).  HANNITY:  Do you worry about party unity?  You --GUILFOYLE:  Yes, I do.  I'll tell you why.  As an attorney, as a prosecutor, I'm very concerned about the U.S. Supreme Court.  And I'm telling you, if the Republicans like go into this, just like Laura Ingraham said, they go into that convention, they're not united, you might as well hand it over and not even show up at any other, you know, further convention stuff going forward, because it's going to be game over.  HANNITY:  Eric, he's going to start a series of policy speeches.  He starts tomorrow on foreign policy.  He has one upcoming on judicial philosophy where he told me the other night in an interview that he will give the names of only the 10 or 12 people that he would ever consider for the Supreme Court.  They will be either Antonin Scalia-like, or Justice Thomas-like.Will that -- will that maybe help conservatives that support Ted Cruz, that may have doubts about Trump as he moves forward?BOLLING:  I would hope that they take what Donald Trump did with Paul Manafort and say, hey, he can surround himself with people that know things that he may not know, areas that he may not have experience in, and bring them into the fold and he'll make some good policy decisions.  I mean, there's some concern about that but he did great with the delegate process.  That list of data that you just outlined right there, the exit poll stuff that Americans are really worried about, that should be his -- his basically campaign philosophy against Hillary Clinton when he becomes the nominee.  Instead of fighting with Ted Cruz and John Kasich, turn it over to her and say you want eight more years of Obama policy?  In Hillary Clinton, you get eight more years of that.HANNITY:  Willie, let me throw this last question at you.  Ted Cruz and John Kasich made the case -- they -- they say they do better in head-to-head match-ups.  Interesting, battleground poll yesterday, it was within margin of error, Trump versus Hillary.  You buy that argument?  And if they make that argument, why aren't they doing better in terms of primary voting?  ROBERTSON:  I don't buy that argument at all, because if you go back to when Trump first started, and you looked at polls and you've seen how they've changed, especially once he started getting momentum and steamrolling people, and you saw things change.  I think Hillary's a terrible candidate.HANNITY:  Awful.ROBERTSON:  I mean, I -- I think she got trounced by Obama.  She's probably better than she is now, because now she has all this other baggage.  People don't like her and I think she's very beatable.  And once it gets down to tow, I think you'll see the polls changing.  You'll see these people start moving.  I just -- I just -- it's a bad argument.  HANNITY:  All right, thank you guys for being with us.  Good to see you all. Great to have you in town, by the way.Now, programming note.  Don't forget.  Right after this show, in 26 minutes from right now, KG, Eric Bolling, and of course all of our friends at ""The Five"", they will be live for analysis and continuing coverage.And coming up, we have more reaction to tonight's five primary races.  We got Tucker Carlson, Geraldo Rivera, Monica Crowley will weigh in as we continue tonight on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The other day, Mr. Trump accused me of playing the, quote, woman card.  Boo. Well, if fighting for women's health care and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the woman card, then deal me in.  TRUMP:  I work far more for women than Hillary Clinton will ever do.  Including -- remember this.  Including protecting our country, because she will not be good with the military, she will not be good with protecting our country.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  all right, that was Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump trading jabs earlier tonight.  So is this a preview of upcoming attractions?  Here with reaction, we have Fox News contributor Tucker Carlson, Fox News senior correspondent Geraldo Rivera, and Fox News contributor, and she's with ""The Washington Times"", Monica Crowley.  All right, Geraldo, I find her speeches -- and don't take this the wrong way because I know you -- you're going -- he's going to take it the wrong way.  I find it unlistenable.  They just -- she like screams them.  What is that?  GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  The fact that she is at times screechy.  I think -- what I would do, if I were her -- let me finish.  If I were her --HANNITY:  I'm laughing, because if I did --RIVERA:  If I were her, I would have an audio engineer give her an earpiece where she can hear what the microphone is hearing.  And I think it would solve the problem.  I don't understand how these professional politicians haven't taken care of what is essentially a technical problem.  She sounds like this.  And (INAUDIBLE).  Because she's playing to the crowd instead of to the mike.  It's a simple fix. But let me say --HANNIT:  You know what I love about you?  You're so honest and you can get away with it because of your politics.  If I said what you just said, right?  I'm in trouble.RIVERA:  One more point on that.  I think that Donald Trump can and should go after Bill Clinton, as he has very effectively, with Monica Lewinsky and using that as the --HANNITY:  Coming from you?  I am shocked.  RIVERA:  But he cannot savage Hillary Clinton in the same way.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Sure, he can.RIVERA:  (INAUDIBLE) who is her opponent (INAUDIBLE) across the stage and hand it to her on a piece of paper. Hillary Clinton is going to pay the price.  MONICA CROWLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I disagree with that.HANNITY:  Tell him why.  Because I agree with you.CROWLEY:  First of all, Donald Trump is not a politician so the standard rules of political play do not apply to him.  He can get away with a lot more than the average politician or more traditional candidate can. Secondly, that sort of rash persona where he takes no prisoners and he doesn't care who you are.  He doesn't care that Hillary Clinton is a Clinton.  He doesn't care that she's a woman.  He blasted Bill, he is blasting her, he's getting away with it.  And it's gotten him to this point--RIVERA:  If you want him to lose women by 55, 70 percent.CROWLEY:  -- where he is at the precipice of getting the Republican nomination.  He's not about to stop now because this is who he is.HANNITY:  Is this fait accompli, Tucker?  Do you -- I would urge people on both sides, and I'm getting notes from Trump supporters, Cruz supporters, remiding this is not over.  Big night, five states, six in a row, almost a full delegate sweep of six states.  But Indiana is coming up.  And then other states are coming up that I think, on paper, are favorable to Ted Cruz. What do you think?  TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, if it's not over it's hurtling toward over.  The shock among Republicans in Washington is -- it's a sight to behold.  They really believe that voters out there in the states are dangerously out of touch with Republican pundits and donors.  I mean, they really believe that.  And they've gotten to the point where they're blaming voters for something they can't control.  So the new idea is, well, voters are just stupid and they're just liberal.  They're just not conservative.  This coming from the exact same people who refused to secure our borders in the Republican Party, who sent Americans to die in order to nation-build in the Middle East.  They're lecturing conservatives in the states, well, you're not really a conservative. As if they're the only ones who get to define what that is.HANNITY:  But here's an important question I want to ask you, though.  Will they sabotage?  Will they want the Republican insurgent presidential candidate to lose so they can say see?  We told you how dumb you are?  CARLSON:  Well, that's what they're doing.  That's what they're doing right now.  I mean, of course.  I mean, no one's even -- look, no one's even making an affirmative case against Trump.  They're just -- they're saying well, you're just -- he's just racist.  I mean, they're employing the ugliest tactics of the left in order to discredit Trump without defending their own views.  Look, if you're for open borders, if you're for more foreign wars, if you think that carried interest on the state of the tax code, say so.  Make your own case.  But they don't.  They instead just attack him as just beyond the pale.  It tells you everything.HANNITY:  Let's talk about a VP candidate.  And then let's -- it doesn't have to be Donald Trump.  Let's just -- he is probably in many people's minds tonight the presumptive nominee.  The number of delegates that we have, at least 105 of 118.RIVERA:  He's the nominee.HANNITY:  You think he's the nominee?RIVERA:  I think he's the nominee.HANNITY:  You think he's the nominee?CROWLEY:  Well, I think it looks increasingly likely.HANNITY:  OK, who would be the best VP if that's the  case?CROWLEY:  Well, I think he's got some obvious choices.  Number one would be Ted Cruz because he --  HANNITY:  Ted Cruz?  CROWLEY:  Well, he's given Donald Trump a real run for his money.HANNITY:  Hold the nose!CROWLEY:  Second choice, I think Marco Rubio, who he said some nice things about.  And Rubio has returned the favor over the last week.  He's still got a number of delegates that could come into play.HANNITY:  What about Kasich?  Of Ohio?CROWLEY:  John Kasich.  John Kasich, his whole mission was to prove that he could, as running for vice president, not running for president, running for vice president, that he could deliver the key state of Ohio.  He has done that.  He has proven that point.  Why he's still in this race I'm not quite sure.  But he would also be an obvious choice.  HANNITY:  All right, Geraldo's having a heart attack over there.CROWLEY:  But he's a little bit of a loose cannon.HANNITY:  What's the matter?RIVERA:  I think that Kasich is the obvious choice.  I am so sad that his eating disorder has been exposed by Donald Trump because they think Donald Trump has diminished him by ranking him out --HANNITY:  Eating disorder?RIVERA:  Oh come on, this gobbling.  I think now, when you see -- and I really like John Kasich, who was my colleague, our colleague, he was at Fox News for three years.  I think in Ohio, my wife's from Cleveland, I think he's enormously popular.  It makes all the sense in the world and I hope that he can be repaired.  I have a job for Ted Cruz.  He should police bathrooms to make sure none of those transgender people sneak in unless they are biologically --  HANNITY:  Wait, wait.  Just when you start making a little bit of sense, you go off the deep end.  You do.  You're almost there for a little bit. Tucker?CARLSON:  Well, yes, but I think we're missing it.  Trump can't pick a man.  Not because he needs to win female voters, he'll do fine, but because he can't share a stage with a man.  He instinctively diminishes every man who stands next to him.  He needs to be the top guy and it's just very uncomfortable to watch.  He can only exist with a woman.HANNITY:  I disagree with that.  CARLSON:  Really?  HANNITY:  You don't think he can share a stage with any of the names that were just mentioned?CARLSON:  No.  I don't think he would allow it.  I think he really needs to diminish the guy because that's who he is.  I'm not attacking him.  Just watch --HANNITY:  (INAUDIBLE).  But don't successful businesspeople -- if you own a business, like for example, we have this television show.  I want the best, the smartest, the brightest people surrounding me, because that helps me be successful.CARLSON:  Yes, that's true.  But you can't factor out people's instincts.  And Trump's instinct is always to be dominant.  And that's one of the reasons a lot of his key advisors are women, starting with his daughter, who I think is his most important advisor.  I just -- it's really tough to see him sharing a ticket with a man.HANNITY:  (INAUDIBLE) real quick.CROWLEY:  Well, I don't necessarily agree with the premise, but I would say he does need a help with female voters, so he might have to choose a woman like --HANNITY:  Monica Crowley, maybe.CROWLEY:  Well, OK, we could have a Draft Monica moment here on ""Hannity."" Or Governor Susana Martinez of New Mexico.HANNITY:  Susana Martinez did not have a lot of nice things to say about him.RIVERA:  (INAUDIBLE) Little Marco.  Every time you see Marco Rubio, you're going to think Little Marco.  I think that Kasich can be rehabilitated.HANNITY:  I don't believe that.  CROWLEY:  He can -- he can -- yes.HANNITY:  Eating, one little eating comment?RIVERA:  It wasn't --(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  OK, now I think Kasich is rehabilitated.   RIVERA:  Rehabilitatable.HANNITY: Rehabilitatable.  All right, we'll put that in the new dictionary.  All right, thank -- that wasn't a beau (ph) word.  All right, so we're pretty good there.All right, guys, thank you all.Coming up, Larry Elder, Peter Johnson, Jr, they weigh in on tonight's primary results tonight as ""Hannity"" continues.  Straight ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  I call her Crooked Hillary.  She's crooked.  She'll be a horrible president.  She knows nothing about job creation.  When it came to answering the phone at 3:00 in the morning, she was sleeping, OK?  She was, with Benghazi and all of the other problems.  You look at what she did with Syria.  You look at what she's done in so many different ways.  She will not be a good president.  She doesn't have the strength.  She doesn't have the stamina.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Donald Trump earlier tonight, five for five.  Joining us with analysis, well, we have Salem Radio and CRN talk show host Larry Elder, Fox News legal analyst Peter Johnson, Jr., both attorneys.Let's talk about that.  He said, Peter, it would be easier to beat Hillary than any of the 17 that he challenged.PETER JOHNSON, JR.,  FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST:  I think he's showing great confidence.  He's ready to go toe-to-toe, head-to-head with Hillary Clinton.  And nobody, very few people, but for Sean Hannity and a couple of others, understood that he had the capacity and the desire and the ability to be in the position that he is in now.  And he's saying to America I can do it.  I will do it.  I'm not afraid of Hillary Clinton.  I'm not afraid of the Democrats.  And, tomorrow, I'm going to be telling you what my foreign policy views are, and then on other issues going forward.  So this is a full-throated presidential campaign, based on someone who wants to win and is going to show the capacity not only to win but to lead in America.  HANNITY:  Larry, let's talk about this new maybe campaign strategy, or maybe a new approach to things.  He gave a speech at AIPAC.  It went over pretty well.  Tomorrow it's foreign policy.  We expect judicial philosophy, coupled with specific names that he would limit his choice to the Supreme Court so people would know ahead of time if he becomes the nominee.  Will this go a long way to helping him?  Will this help maybe those millions of conservatives that don't like him, that are supporting, say, Ted Cruz?LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO/CRN TALK SHOW HOST:  Well, it's the next obvious step to go.  I mean, he's vanquished his opponents.  Now he's got to show that he can actually be a president.You know, Sean, I just saw the movie ""Batman V Superman"".  And if I'm Ted Cruz, this is a spoiler alert for people who haven't seen it.  If I'm Ted Cruz, I feel like Superman after the beatdown that Batman put on him.  And probably almost as big as this five state sweep that Donald Trump has had tonight is that poll that you just now mentioned, the GW battleground poll, which shows him just three points behind Hillary.  The argument has always been against Donald Trump that, OK, he can galvanize some people.  He can get some crossover votes.  He's entertaining.  He's spontaneous.  He's politically incorrect.  But he can't beat Hillary.  He's already within three points of her, at least by this one poll.  That is almost as big a deal as what happened tonight.  HANNITY:  Do you think he is the presumptive nominee, Peter?  JOHNSON:  Oh, I think he is the presumptive nominee.  And what he's going to demonstrate going forward is a few issues.  Reform, rejuvenation, renaissance, and redemption.  He has shown that he has the capacity to change the Republican Party.  He is not wedded to the lost and broken principles of some in the Republican Party.  And so he will not be handcuffed by that, and by token of that, he will have the ability to reach out to Democrats and to independents and say I can be a true compassionate conservative and bring governance to all people in this country at a real price and with real values.  That is going to be his strength, and he will have a -- they'll have a hard time stopping him on those issues because he's so different.  HANNITY:  Does populism, nationalism, become a big part of modern day conservatism as a result of Trump's position?  Larry?ELDER:  No, not really, Sean.  I hate to make things overly simple.  It is still the economy, stupid.  Both the Bernie Sanders supporters and the Trump supporters are mad at the same thing.  This has been the worst economic recovery in our lifetime.  Obama will be the first president to preside over a recovery where not one year we've had 3 percent GDP growth.  People are upset.  Their incomes are stagnant. They don't feel their futures are positive.  They want some real change, they want the economy to do well, they want their paychecks to rise.  That's why they're so upset.  And Donald Trump has tapped right into that.  HANNITY:  Yes, you know what?  Go back to those numbers.  60 percent feel betrayed by the Republican Party.  39 percent say it's economy and jobs.  57 percent very worried about the economy.  And 83 percent believe we need an outsider.Peter Johnson, Jr., Larry Elder, good to see you.ELDER:  Good to see you, Sean.HANNITY:  Thank you.  When we come back, we've got more ""Hannity"" right after this break.  Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  Welcome back to ""Hannity.""  Now, if you're in Indianapolis, you want to see Greta and Donald Trump, it's gretawire.com.  Now, that's all the time we have left this evening.  But let not your heart be troubled.  My great friends at ""The Five"" have a special midnight edition.  They take it over from here.  We'll see you back at 10:00 Eastern tomorrow night.Have a great night.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS HOST:  Two major stories breaking tonight.  One involving a monster storm that's impacting much of the U.S. East Coast.  And another involving big developments that could change the trajectory of the White House race.  Welcome to ""The Kelly File."" I'm Shannon Bream in for Megyn Kelly. Tonight, the Clinton campaign is once again in damage control mode.  After the FBI releases new details about her server scandal, raising serious new questions about the investigation and what some feel was an incomplete investigation by the FBI.  We'll get to that in just a moment.  But first to the deadly tropical storm Hermine, which raced across the state of Florida leaving heavy damage in its wake.  Tonight a tropical storm warning is in effect all the way from Georgia to New Jersey.  Amtrak has canceled some service.  Roads are flooded.  Hundreds of thousands are still without power, and multiple states of emergency are in effect.  The storm is expected to make its way across North Carolina tonight.  And that is where we find Joel Waldman reporting tonight from Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.  Hi, Joel.  JOEL WALDMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Shannon, good evening to you.  Your timing on live television is impeccable because over the last hour or so, the wind's really picking up here in the outer banks of North Carolina. And although you can't see it behind me, you can see the sand dunes, but behind that obviously the mighty Atlantic Ocean, and those waves really starting to kick up.  Now, you combine that with about 10 inches of rain that they are expecting along with one to three feet of storm surge and upwards of 50-mile-an-hour winds and that is a major problem potentially with coastal flooding.  So, a lot of people have already taken off.  The governor here in North Carolina has said better to be over-prepared so that we are underwhelmed. And you've really seen people heed that advice, but obviously this is the Labor Day weekend.  It is a big money weekend for the hotels down here and obviously other tourist attractions.  But in talking to people, about a third of these people have actually canceled their bookings.  So that is thousands of tourists that are not coming here.  A lot of hotel rooms empty and because of that, a lot of restaurants empty.  And obviously people are not going into the stores to buy merchandise and things of that nature.  Meanwhile, the Emergency Operations Center is open and ready for business. The governor is hoping they won't have to use it, but they do have national guardsmen on standby and Humvees to get people out in case of major flooding.  But as you can tell right now -- and I know it's a little bit harder on the television to see it, but the winds really starting to whip up, coming off the East Coast.  And of course the fear now is this storm could head up north, pick up more steam in the Atlantic, and potentially barrel into cities in the northeast like New York City.  But, Shannon, for now I will send it back to you.  You enjoy yourself in that warm, cozy dry studio.  BREAM:  I know, please be careful out there.  We really appreciate your on the scene reporting, but stay safe.  Thanks, Joel.  WALDMAN:  We will.  BREAM:  All right.  So, what is next?  Chief meteorologist Rick Reichmuth is live in the Fox Weather Center.  He's tracking all of the Hermine moves.  Where is it now?  Where it could be next?  How could it affect your holiday weekend?  Hi, Rick.  RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS CHIEF METEOROLOGIST:  Hey, there.  Yes. Especially when it kind of stops moving and that's when we're going to feel the big impacts over the next couple of days.  We're probably going to be talking about Hermine until Wednesday, I would say, which is not good news for a lot of people across the east.  The center probably right there, around the Myrtle Beach area at this point.  But tonight, we're going to be under the gun here across a lot of North Carolina and in and around the outer banks where John just was.  Tornado concerns until midnight.  At least this watch is in effect until midnight.  I think we'll see another one issued later on.  But we're going to see very heavy rain, an additional probably six to eight inches of rain. Because of that, we're going to see some more flooding.  We have flash flooding going on, down across parts of Southeastern North Carolina.  Flood watches in effect really for a lot of state and up towards around Norfolk, Virginia.  This is the track.  And over about the next 24 hours, we're certain this storm is going to move in this direction.  Then it gets back over water, and the water here out across north part of the Atlantic or the mid-Atlantic is a lot warmer than normal, and it very likely is going to go right around the Gulf Stream. The water is very warm there, and it will give it the strength likely to strengthen again, maybe back up to a hurricane-strength storm, getting very close here down the -- or the New Jersey coastline.  We're expecting to see a prolonged event here.  We have tropical storm watches -- excuse me -- warnings through New Jersey. Watches in effect for the Connecticut coastline, and we're going to be watching a prolonged event.  A very strong winds, we're going to see a very significant storm surge for about two to three days across the Jersey Shore especially.  Lots of coastal erosion, lot of flooding.  We have a really dangerous situation on our hands likely took Tuesday to Wednesday -- Shannon.  BREAM:  All right.  Let's hope folks heeds your warning.  Rick, thank you for the update.  REICHMUTH:  Yes.  You bet.  BREAM:  Also breaking tonight, for the fourth time since the Clinton e-mail scandal broke, the government has dumped a big load of news on a holiday weekend.  Only serving to reinforce the criticism that there's something they're hiding.  Earlier today, the FBI released a summary of its July interview with Hillary Clinton involving allegations that classified information was stored on her personal server, potentially putting national security at risk.  You'll recall, of course, the FBI did not recommend charges against the former secretary of state.  The Clinton campaign has been quick to react, saying that her use of the private account was a clear mistake, but the documents show that there was no basis to move forward with a legal case against her.  Her critics don't agree.  Donald Trump saying he doesn't understand how she was able to get away from being prosecuted.  What's more, the documents raise further questions about Mrs. Clinton's repeated claims that she handed over everything that was work-related.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I responded right away and provided all my e-mails that could possibly be work-related.  We went through a thorough process to identify all of my work-related e-mails and deliver them to the State Department.  At the end, I chose not to keep my private personal e-mails, e-mails about planning Chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines, family vacations, the other things you typically find in in boxes.  I think that anybody who has actually looked at this has concluded that I have now put out all of my e-mails.  (END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM:  Okay.  We now know that's not the whole truth and that the FBI did, in fact, recover more than 17,000 e-mails that were never handed over. Those e-mails are said to be a mix of both work-related and personal messages.  Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge reports from Washington on what else we've learned.  Catherine.  CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  This 11- page FBI summary of Hillary Clinton's July 2nd interview shows the former Secretary of State could not remember key details about her e-mails more than two dozen times.  Clinton told FBI agents she could not recall when she got a security clearance.  Clinton could not recall briefings or training on the handling of classified information, and Clinton could not recall specialized training for the U.S. government's most closely held secrets known as special access programs.  Critics aren't buying it.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is a case of special, you know -- Mrs. Clinton operates under one set of rules and the rest of the federal  government operates under another set.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HERRIDGE:  The same week Clinton became Secretary of State, she also signed two non-disclosure agreements where she said she knew the rules and that violating these agreements could result in criminal charges.  Clinton told the FBI that she could not recall the details surrounding the 2009 setup of the Clintone-mail.com domain whose servers were housed at their Chappaqua, New York home.  Clinton said the personal e-mail account was a matter of convenience.  FBI agents do not appear to press Clinton on the issue. Further reinforcing Republican criticism of the FBI director and the investigation.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TREY GOWDY, R-SOUTH CAROLINA CONGRESSMAN:  My takeaway was this. Remember James Comey said she was not indicted because he didn't have sufficient evidence on the issue of intent.  She said she did it for convenience.  But I didn't see the follow-up questions in the interview I read.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HERRIDGE:  The heavily redacted FBI summary also shows Clinton was questioned about the 22 top secret e-mails too damaging to release for national security reasons, which include the drone campaign as well as human spying for CIA programs.  A separate document providing a case timeline shows 13 of Clinton's mobile devices are unaccounted for.  And without a forensic examination, the FBI couldn't say whether they were hacked -- Shannon.  BREAM:  All right.  Catherine Herridge, thank you so much.  Joining us now, David Wohl, an attorney and Trump supporter.  Alan Colmes, host of ""The Alan Colmes Show"" on Fox News radio.  And Guy Benson, townhall.com political editor and a Fox News contributor.  All right.  Alan, I'll start with you because we have a lot of -- we have many new revelations here, and they all point to one thing.  Either Mrs. Clinton was not being honest, or as some would say, her critics would say, she is incompetent.  She's somebody that wants to be the commander-in- chief, will be handling the most top secret information in the world, and even though FBI Director James Comey said, anybody who is a reasonable person should have known better than exactly what she did.  ALAN COLMES, HOST, ""THE ALAN COLMES SHOW"":  Well, I don't agree with those either/ors.  Number one, the FBI did not indict or did not recommend indict.  And number two --  BREAM:  But he did say she did an extremely careless job with this and any reasonable person -- she was a cabinet secretary -- should have known better.  COLMES:  Number two is that we have no new information here.  This is what the FBI already did.  They already looked at --  BREAM:  I didn't know that she had 13 devices plus five iPads.  COLMES:  The FBI already -- but this is everything the FBI already knew, and the FBI decided there was not enough here, that there's no precedent for going forward.  This is basically a political witch-hunt at this point. We just saw a Trey Gowdy, who had her in front of him for 11 hours and did a horrible job if he's trying to get anything out of her that's indictable. He didn't -- he couldn't come up with anything, and so now he's trying to save grace.  I mean she stood before an 11-hour witch-hunt because they probably think she's a witch, and we keep going over this old ground over and over and over again.  BREAM:  But since she testified -- but since she testified, Alan --  COLMES:  There's nothing new.  BREAM:  There have been new revelations.  They come all the time.  COLMES:  What new revelation?BREAM:  Seventeen thousand e-mails that we didn't know about.  COLMES:  It's not new to the FBI.  The FBI knew everything that came out today.  BREAM:  Okay.  Not new to the FBI but -- Trey Gowdy wouldn't have known that when he was questioning her.  COLMES:  But the FBI having known all this, decided there was no reason to go forward.  This is everything James  Comey, a Republican, knew already, and now all of a sudden conservatives are acting as if suddenly all this new information has come out, and that's it.  It's much ado about nothing.  BREAM:  It was new to the Congressional -- it would be new to Trey Gowdy and the other people that --  (CROSSTALK)COLMES:  The Congress had 11 hours to question her and they didn't come out --   BREAM:  But they didn't have half the information they have now.  David, you're an attorney --  COLMES:  Eleven hour and they didn't come up with anything.BREAM:  David, you're an attorney and, you know, Alan makes a great point. The FBI had all of this.  James Comey, the FBI director, has been a very respected inspector and prosecutor and, you know, person over the years. He said not enough to indict.  So, shouldn't that be the end of it?DAVID WOHL, ATTORNEY:  You know, when in doubt, Shannon, plead ignorance. I mean, Hillary Clinton has two major allies.  She has the Department of Justice, Barack Obama's Department of Justice on her side, and she's got the mainstream media completely in the tank for her.  She can't remember a darn thing about those top-secret or classified e-mails, so what does she do?  She makes sure she'll never be able to remember anything by scrubbing her illegal server with the BleachBit.  COLMES:  Doug, come on!  WOHL:  This whole scandal, this whole scandal and it's growing and will continue to grow in the coming weeks.  COLMES:  There's no scandal that's growing.WOHL:  It makes Watergate look like a parking ticket.  COLMES:  You wish it were growing.  WOHL:  This is so out of control right now.  COLMES:  This is over.  This is done.  WOHL:  The American voters are going to stand --   BREAM:  All right.  Gentlemen --  WOHL:  Wait a second, Alan.  Whether or not you want somebody who is so rife with corruption that she can't do a single thing without violating the law --  BREAM:  All right.  Guy is waiting patiently.  WOHL:  Donald Trump, who has no history of corruption and a lot of great ideas.  COLMES:  What?  Donald Trump --  BREAM:  I know that Alan wants to jump on that, but let's bring in Guy here to give us a little bit of an outside look.  And what you think, I mean, looking at what we learned today, because it's new information to us.  But, you know, it's not to the FBI and they decided no prosecution.  GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  There are two significant news worthy revelations in the report that we saw today which did not coincidentally drop on a Friday before a long weekend.  The first of which is that Mrs. Clinton used at least 13 mobile devices during her time at the State Department.  Recall that her initial excuse for setting up the private server was actually one of the conveniences of one device.  She used 13. Now, she was warned personally and explicitly on two occasions that doing official classified business on unsecure blackberries was putting sensitive information at risk.  She continued to do so anyway, and now we find out today that several, an undisclosed number, but several of those blackberries were lost.  She lost these cell phones filled with classified information that she wasn't supposed to be using in the first place.  That is breathtaking, one.  And, two, this is important as well.  With the timeline that is pieced together in the documents that we saw today, Hillary Clinton's team began to purge and scrub her e-mail archives, which were under Congressional subpoena at the time, a few weeks after The New York Times first reported the existence of her server.  If that is not obstruction or intent, I don't know what is.  BREAM:  Alan, it was described as an oh blank moment that somebody realized The New York Times was reporting publicly on this stuff, and that's when we got the BleachBit and after we got the deletion of information that could have been relevant.  COLMES:  It's fine to me that -- Guy seems to know more than James Comey because James Comey said --  BENSON:  No.  COLMES:  If I may finish.  Said there was no obstruction and there was no intent, unlike with David Petraeus, for example, whether there was intent and there was obstruction.  So if the FBI director who did an investigation and said she  did not lie to the FBI and could not find intent, which is the basis upon which he decided he would not recommend an  indictment, but I guess you know more, Guy.  BREAM:  Okay.  Very quickly, David.  I want to give David a final word here.  I want to give David a final word here and just ask if Alan, Guy, you, or me had done the stuff that's been outlined by James Comey, do you think we would have gotten a pass?WOHL:  You would be in jail calling my office for a bail hearing.  There is no question about it.  Hillary Clinton's name is Clinton.  That's why she's not in jail.  This Department of Justice has her back.  It's Barack Obama's Department of Justice.  He formally endorsed her as president of the United States.  Give me a break.  That's what this boils down to.  But we haven't seen the end of it.  COLMES:  All right.  I'm not sure I'd be calling your office as my attorney, but thank you for the offer if I ever need one again.  BREAM:  Alan, you can also call me.  I passed the bar.  COLMES:  I would call Shannon.  I would call Shannon.  There's no question about that.BREAM:  All right.  David, Alan, Guy, great to see you all on a Friday night.  COLMES:  Thank you.WOHL:  Thank you.BENSON:  Thank you, Shannon.  BREAM:  All right.  Up next, new setbacks for our current commander-in-chief.  How a sluggish economy is sinking ObamaCare and new revelations surrounding the nuclear deal with Iran are affecting the 2016 race.  Charles Krauthammer is here with how all of that could impact Hillary Clinton's chances in November.  Plus, Chris Stirewalt and Rich Lowry are here on breaking details from what really happened after Donald Trump's meeting with the Mexican president. Oh, it's getting more spicy.  That's just ahead.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Look.  We're the only ones that know what's going on with illegal immigration.  Hillary Clinton has no clue and doesn't care.  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM:  Developing tonight, new details emerging about Donald Trump's busy Wednesday that began with that visit to Mexico City and the aftermath of his meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.  The two men singing a seemingly harmonious tune.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRES. ENRIQUE PENA NIETO, MEXICO (through a translator):  I do recognize the fundamental right that each of the countries has to defend its border. I also believe that a true effort of collaboration between neighbors and allies is the most effective road in order to achieve this.  TRUMP:  Having a secure border is a sovereign right and mutually beneficial.  We recognize and respect the right of either country to build a physical barrier or wall on any of its borders to stop the illegal movement of people, drugs, and weapons.  Cooperation toward achieving this shared objective --  (END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM:  Prior to those remarks, the two men had agreed apparently they would not mention paying for the border wall.  So team Trump says they were surprised when Pena Nieto tweeted soon after, quote, ""At the beginning of the conversation with Donald Trump, I made clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall.""  That tweet reportedly angered Trump so much that he reinserted this key line back into his immigration speech.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  We will build a great wall along the Southern border, and Mexico will pay for the wall.  Hundred percent.  They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for the wall.  And they're great people and great leaders, but they're going to pay for the wall.  (END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM:  Yikes.  All right.  Joining me now, Chris Stirewalt, Fox News digital politics editor.  And Rich Lowry, editor of National Review and Fox News contributor.  Great to see you both.  RICH LOWRY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Hi, there.  CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR:  Hi, Shannon.  BREAM:  All right.  Chris, to read behind the scenes of how they negotiated this whole thing where no one is going to talk about paying for the wall. This is just a first, initial meeting.  And to hear that the Mexican president brought it up right away, and Rudy Giuliani, who was there with the Trump side of this, stopped right away like, no, no, no.  We're not going to be talking about that.  They played so nice at the meeting or the, you know, public part after the meeting.  But, man, it got ugly really quick after that.  STIREWALT:  All right.  So it seems like the key moment was that Trump was asked the question about, by the way, Mr. Trump, you said that you're not going to just build the wall but make Mexico pay for it.  Here we're talking about, you know, tens of billions of dollars.  And Trump said it didn't come up.  Didn't come up.  The wall didn't come up.  And then afterwards, the Mexican president obviously felt obliged to say, well, no, it did come up.  I brought it up at the very beginning and told him we wouldn't be paying for it.  So this, then, gets the counter fire from Trump who says, oh, no, no, no. You're going to pay for it.  You don't know it yet, but you're going to pay for it.  And this is the thing that's challenging when you try to have a bifurcated day like Trump did.  He wants to have a beginning of his day where he's cool, where he's talking, he's on the international stage.  He's got a nice, greenback drop there, it's very mild and mellow.  And then he's going to come back to the United States.  He is going to go to Arizona, he's going to hang out with Joe Arpaio and Jeff Sessions.  He is going to talk, hot, hot, hot, hot about illegal immigrants and rapists and murder and all of this, all the hottest language possible.  So when you try to do it both ways, you end up having a little bleed over from one to the other.  BREAM:  But, Rich, that Wednesday night speech is exactly how he won the primary.  Millions of people like what he has to say about immigration. They voted for him, and maybe he felt like after -- and some people were saying he got owned by the president.  The Hillary Clinton team was saying, you know, he showed that he doesn't understand how to do foreign policy and it blew up in his face.  What other choice did he have but to go to the wall Wednesday night?LOWRY:  Well, that speech, I think, Shannon you're absolutely right.  They have to underline that phrase.  It's how he won the primaries.  He is now trying to win a general election, which is a different animal.  And I thought that speech on the substance was utterly sound and unassailable. But the tone was very much a  primary tone, and I think, you know, going to Chris' point about the bifurcated day, if you're going to go to Mexico to look statesman-like, sound statesman like in your policy speech in the evening as well.  And I think that's where he made the mistake.  He shouldn't have given the speech in a rally setting.  He should have been in front of a Think Tank audience, where he didn't feel obligated to play to the crowd and kind of projected much more of a sense and sobriety and strength.  He's not losing this race on the issues so much.  He's losing it on demeanor and the perception that he doesn't have presidential qualities.  So it doesn't make any sense to have this lightning-strike into Mexico, which works and where he projects all those qualities, and then to do something totally different at night.  BREAM:  All right.  Chris, king of the cross tabs, I want to talk to you about some polling stuff.  Fox digital poll shows that Hispanic registered voters favored Clinton 66 percent to Donald Trump's 26 percent.  Is it hurting or helping themselves this week?STIREWALT:  Okay.  Look, Donald Trump is not going to win the election with the support of Hispanic voters.  That's not how he's going to do this.  BREAM:  But he needs a good chunk of them.  STIREWALT:  Nah.  Mitt Romney only did 25 percent.  Donald Trump is going to do worse with Hispanic voters.  He's going to do worse with black voters, and all non-white voters presumably than Mitt Romney did.  His key is that he is trying to juice white turnout.  He is trying to juice the turnout of blue collar, white voters, who stayed home by the way.  And there is real evidence that blue collar white voters, especially in the upper Midwest, stayed home.  And so he's trying to get there the other way.  However, he has to do it with the other part of the Republican coalition. And that's college educated white voters, who vote for him, who are supporting him in large number.  But he needs to get back to those Romney- size numbers with those voters if he wants to deal with the blue collar whites.  The key in the outreach, whether it is with Mexico, talking about and cementing his shift on deportations or whether he's talking to black voters in Detroit or elsewhere, the key is convincing college-educated white voters that he is not racist.  He is not what they say he is.  BREAM:  And, Rich, quickly before we're out of time, now he is making this visit this weekend to Detroit to stop it at an African-American church to be interviewed by the pastor there.  What sort of risk/reward situation is he walking into there?LOWRY:  Well, it's a little bit like the trip to Mexico.  If something blows up, it's going to be really bad.  But if he performs ably, it's going to be good for him.  And I think anything the campaign can do to get him in different settings where he's not in front of big rally audiences and when he is shouting, is very good for him.  So, I think it's right that they're being a little more imaginative and mixing it up, and now it's a question of whether he can pull it off in performance.  BREAM:  We'll be watching.  Rich, Chris, great to see you both.  STIREWALT:  Have a great weekend.  You bet.  BREAM:  Thank you.  You too.Right up next, Hurricane Hermine leaving a trail of destruction in her wake.  One person is dead.  Hundreds of thousands still in the dark.  We're going to take you on the ground in Florida as that state begins to clean up.  Plus, while Obama's approval ratings are sky high, some of his major policies look to be tanking.  Should Donald Trump be doing more to tie Hillary Clinton to the current administration's trouble?  Charles Krauthammer is here with some surprising recommendations, next.    (COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM: Breaking tonight, Tropical Storm Hermine surging through the south and marching north ahead of the busy Labor Day weekend. Hermine making landfall on Florida's north West Coast earlier today.Downgraded from a category 1 hurricane to a tropical storm on its way to the Carolinas.Here's a look at some of the devastation Hermine left in her wake earlier today as she swept through Cedar Key, Florida.That's where Steve Harrigan joins us live tonight with the latest on the storm that clip. And, Steve, after your live shots yesterday, I'm just happy to see you are in one piece, safe and sound.STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  We're all good here, Shannon. But the coast of Florida is a little bit different. You can see here in this palm tree a bit of mattress, some chairs also stuck in that tree.And if you look over here, some of the damage from that 9-foot storm surge. This condominium, you can actually see all the way through from one end all the way out the front. The wall is knocked down.This place got pounded by 80-mile-per-hour winds as well as that heavy storm surge. You can see bits and pieces of people's belongings all over the place here, ironing boards, satellite dishes, pictures, personal belongings. They've been hit pretty hard here.And ordinarily the day after a disaster, you see a lot of activity, people picking through the wreckage, a lot of emergency equipment crews trying to rebuild. We are not seeing that great amount of activity here today. Perhaps that's for a couple of reasons.In some cases like this, maybe the devastation is so complete, people are not going to be able to recover at all. But also a sense that maybe they can't get back here or because the conditions are so difficult.No running water. No electric power. At this hour, more than 220,000 Floridians have no electric power. Some seniors just came up to us a few minutes ago, furious that they're going to spend a second night in the dark here along the coast.Shannon, back to you.BREAM:  I think that includes my parents. But again, safe and sound, good to hear it. Steve, thank you.Developing tonight, as the campaign battle between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton continues to dominate the daily news cycle.President Obama finds himself enjoying his highest approval ratings in years. That's despite a growing list of issues facing some of his administration's most significant policies.First, his signature law, ObamaCare, seeing premiums rising sharply. And some of the country's biggest insurers threatening to back out.Plus, a shocking new report suggesting his administration gave secret exemptions to the nuclear deal with Iran. And today's disappointing jobs report. With just 151,000 jobs added, down 45 percent from last month, coming on the heels of a sluggish GDP report.All this begging the question should Donald Trump be doing more to portray Hillary Clinton as nothing more than a third Obama term?Joining me now, syndicated columnist and Fox News contributor, Charles Krauthammer. Great to see you tonight, doctor.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST:  Good to be here.BREAM:  OK. So, you know, obviously this is always something that you can use in the campaign, the fact that your opponent, tying them to the current administration if they're from the same party, which she was actually part of the administration. Is Trump missing a golden opportunity here?KRAUTHAMMER:  Well, I'm not sure how golden it is, and the reason is that Obama's own numbers are quite high for someone in the eighth year of his term. It's over 50 percent, which is pretty unusual, and I think one of the reasons is that he's out of sight.Now, just take, for example, health care, which of course extremely unpopular. Always has been. Well, in the years when he was delivering 37, 38 -- we lost track of how many speeches, national addresses on the subject, he was completely associated with it.Well, he hasn't spoken about it for years. In fact, he hasn't sort of been seen for about six months or so because as you said, seeing the media coverage has all been about the campaign. It's as if the country has been run on autopilot. So, the blame attached to the policies is far less than it would be otherwise.Now, this is generally true at the end of two terms, but it's all the more true because it's been an unusually, let's say, an unusual campaign with a lot of entertainment value, and Obama has sort of faded. So, as he fades, his numbers go up. Out of sight, out of mind. It doesn't pay as much to go after him. You want to go after her, and that's been Trump's strategy.BREAM:  Well, and when you think about the fact that she was a member of his team as Secretary of State and she has been critical of some things that have turned into foreign policy, sort of disastrous things. She would have handled them differently.But it seems like Trump has done some connecting her to, you know, obviously the Russian reset, which didn't go quite as smoothly as planned, problems in the Middle East. I mean, does he need to focus on her as an extension of the foreign policy from this administration?KRAUTHAMMER:  I think the things he's missing is, look, the biggest disaster of the last eight years in terms of foreign policy was the complete withdrawal from Iraq in 2011, clearly as a way for Obama to clear the way for his re-election campaign. That was a political decision. It was not a strategic decision. And she was in on it.She was Secretary of State. Now, she can say, I gave different advice in private, but that won't wash. I think that is something where you can tie her to him. Instead what they did is when we got the news about the ransom that was given flown, the cash flown into Iran in return for the hostages, they tried to tie her to that, but that occurred after she left office.Any connection between her and that was extremely tenuous. I thought that was a missed opportunity. That was not a credible connection even though she had initiated negotiations on the nuclear deal years ago.She was not involved in the ransom payment. But I think there are issues, clearly the one about the debacle in Iraq and in Syria as a result of the precipitous withdrawal was something that I think he ought to push on very hard.BREAM:  And by the way, as you know, Dr. Krauthammer, they're not calling it the ""r"" word. They're not calling it a ransom.KRAUTHAMMER:  Of course. But we...(CROSSTALK)BREAM:  People may want to define it that way, but the State Department and this administration continues to say not a ransom.KRAUTHAMMER:  But you and I are speaking the truth here, so we do say the word ransom.BREAM:  I'm going to get out my dictionary. But let's talk about the economy as well. Because, you know, we continue to hear, well, hey, unemployment is at 4.9 percent. Things have improved drastically since President Obama took office. Others say dig into those numbers.The labor participation rate at an all-time low. And they say that there are all kinds of fundamental underpinnings of the economy that are in trouble. How can you link that? Should Trump try to link that to her? I mean, we know what her policy positions are on some of these economic issues. Would that be helpful?KRAUTHAMMER:  I think it's a little hard to make her responsible for the current condition, but it is not hard at all, and I think it ought to be the essence of the campaign to say that she represents classic liberalism.In fact, she's probably to the left of Obama because she had to run to the left to catch up with Bernie Sanders in the primaries. And we know where the policies have led. You know, we have now gone eight years.This is the longest, the only time in American history we've gone through a presidential term without a single year of growth at 3 percent. This is unprecedented.And I think what you do is you say she represents the democratic idea, the democratic establishment, and the traditional old, completely obsolete and an anachronistic democratic economic plan to go back to the new deal.It worked in the mid-20th century. It doesn't work now. And do you want to elect that? So I don't think you do this by making the economic argument in terms of blame. What you do is in terms of the future, not the past. This is what the past has brought you, and that's the future she promises you.BREAM:  All right. Well, we'll see if the Trump campaign is listening to ""The Kelly File"" tonight...(CROSSTALK)KRAUTHAMMER:  I'm not sure they listen to me.BREAM:  and taking up to Dr. Krauthammer's advice.KRAUTHAMMER:  They may listen to you.BREAM:  You never know. We'll see. We'll let you know if we hear from him. You let us know if you hear from him too. Charles, great to see you tonight.KRAUTHAMMER:  I'm sure I will. Take care.BREAM:  Thank you.Still ahead, cupcakes at a major university are told not to use certain words that could be offensive to fellow classmates.Plus, the polls tightening between Clinton and Trump as reports surface that Clinton's campaign offices outnumber Trumps three to one. Does Trump have the ground game necessary to close the gap by Election Day? A fair and balanced debate on that, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM:  With just 67 days to go until the November election, the focus now shifting to the candidates' ground games. A staff advertising and battleground appearances takes on a new importance down the home stretch.Donald Trump finds himself nearly two points closer to Clinton than last week. But campaign experts are pointing to some deficiencies in his operation that might make it hard for him to keep up this momentum. Politico proclaiming Mr. Trump's new ad buy is half of what the campaign had promised.And on top of that Clinton's campaign offices outnumbered Trump by more than three to one across key swing states.Joining us now to discuss it all. Kristen Soltis Anderson, republican pollster and columnist at the Washington Examiner, and Jason Osborne, a Trump supporter and former communications strategist to Dr. Ben Carson. Great to see you both.JASON OSBORNE, FORMER BEN CARSON'S COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGIST:  Thank you.KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, WASHINGTON EXAMINER COLUMNIST:  Thanks for having us.BREAM:  All right, Kristen, I'll start with you. Unconventional could be a way we describe the Trump campaign. He plowed through the primary, wiped out 16 other candidates. He has massive crowds showing up. He's picking up in the polls, but nothing about his strategy has been traditional.So, should he be worried about getting it in line with what people will argue has worked for general elections in the past?ANDERSON:  There are things that Donald Trump has benefited from greatly that have allowed him to be a little bit unconventional thus far. For instance, he gets a ton of media coverage, and he gets it all for free, meaning that while normally candidates have to spend tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars to put their message on the air,Donald Trump has benefited from getting an incredible amount of coverage. But what you can't make up for is a ground game, and that's what's really important and where I think the Trump campaign has been lacking.You know, in the 2012 election, Barack Obama's re-election campaign had 780 field offices across the country compared to Mitt Romney's campaign, that only had 280. That gap was huge, and it meant that Barack Obama's re- election team could bring out more African-American voters in key places like Ohio.The Trump campaign has got to catch up if they want to turn out all of those voters that they say are sort of the silent Trump voters that are unlikely but could swing to Trump.BREAM:  Well, and, Jason, we're hearing from the RNC that they're going to deploy hundreds of people, that they're going to beef up these important states with extra offices and more ground game.But there have been, as you know all along, many rumors about tension between the RNC, the Trump camp. They just see doing things differently in many cases. Those are always denied, and they resurface again. Do you think he'll take this help from the RNC, and do you think it will work long-term for him?OSBORNE:  Oh, absolutely. I mean, I think going back to your point at the beginning of this segment, which where you pointed out correctly that during the primary, Donald Trump was outspent hundreds of millions of dollars to virtually nothing, and yet he was still able to generate the movement and get over 13, 14 million votes in a republican primary.And I think he's able to do the same thing here. I do think there is, you know, a concern legitimately that, you know, are we going as a party, going to be able to get enough people out to vote?And I think the answer to that, based particularly on what Reince has said, the chairman of the RNC and the Trump campaign, is that they are teaming up and doing very well together in deploying the traditional, the old 72-hour program has now become the two-month program.And I think the enthusiasm is there for Trump. I don't see it there for Hillary.BREAM:  Yes, a lot of folks would say that, you know, her appearances are much less well attended. The excitement, the passion is not there.Kristen, that's something he definitely seems to have harnessed. But honestly, you know, we've been paying attention to this for a year and a half, but it's now Labor Day.Now America is going to start paying attention. I mean, Kristen, does he have a bit of a clean slate as they're going into what is the home stretch now where people really start to dial in if politics is not their thing?ANDERSON:  So, normally I would say yes, but this is not a normal election. And here you have two candidates for president who are extremely well known by the public. These are folks that have been in the headlines for decades, for almost my entire lifetime. The Clintons and the Trumps have been in the news.So, this is not necessarily a case where you're going to have a lot of voters suddenly learning about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton for the first time when we get into the debates. While you may have had folks first learning about, say, Mitt Romney or John Kerry in the debate phase, here these candidates are pretty well known.And so I think it is -- it's a cliche, to say it comes down to turnout, but it is going to come down to having the actual ground game out there to go find every voter who might consider voting for Donald Trump and knocking on their door and calling them and getting them to the polls.And I'm not quite sure that at this point, the campaign has proven that they've invested as much as the democrats have over the last decade, building that kind of machinery.BREAM:  Yes. Certainly the personnel by both the campaigns and the parties very, very different.We're out of time. We've got to leave it there. But, listen, this campaign has defied all kinds of conventional wisdom, so we'll see if the momentum continues. Jason, Kristen, great to see you both.OSBORNE:  Thank you.BREAM:  Up next, two more institutes of higher learning apparently frowning upon free speech. Nomiki Konst is here to discuss it, and she is fired up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM:  With just 67 days until we elect our next president, some institutions of higher learning seem to be struggling with values that have made this democracy so great since its inception.At Rutgers University, for instance, where college dormitories have been outfitted with bulletins advising students to use only, quote, ""necessary words in order to avoid microaggressions.""Guys in the studio are already laughing list. I'm not finish with the intro yet.And at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, where a new chancellor Ronnie Green instituted a new non-negotiable respect policy at the school, what language falls under the banned category remains to be seen.Joining me now, Nomiki Konst, host of The Filter on SiriusXM progress. Great to have you with us.NOMIKI KONST, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Thanks for joining -- for having me, not joining me.BREAM:  For join -- for joining each other. OK. So, I'm looking at this posting at Rutgers University, and the university says they didn't post this. This is the resident assistants in the dorms and they have freedom to post these kinds of things.But you can't use terms like illegal alien. It's recommended that you don't. They warn about micro assaults, micro insults and micro invalidations if you make someone feel like their point of view is not valid.KONST:  I don't even know what that means. I'm just going to start with that.BREAM:  And a feature ISIS doesn't even...(CROSSTALK)KONST:  Yes.BREAM:  I mean, I feel like they micro -- like do they chop your head off?KONST:  Right.BREAM:  In the real world, this kind of stuff is kind of hurt us all.KONST:  I think that's the issue here. Its liberal arts institutions and colleges, the ones that I value and I really believe in, used to embrace differences of opinion, differences of cultures, and they may not always be great.You may have to read a book about something very uncomfortable to read about from 30, 40, 50, 60, 100 years ago.BREAM:  Right.KONST:  But that helps you critically think.BREAM:  Right.KONST:  It helps you understand what the world is really like. And when you go out into that real world where the internet exists, you're going to see that there are differences of opinion that are very different than yours, but you're not going to be prepared if you're living in this bubble where you're not allowed to see that type of opinion.BREAM:  I mean, that is to me, college is supposed to prepare you for a particular school of study or a particular career that you're pursuing but also for the real world.And I do not understand how young people are expected to go into a corporate culture, even to be out there, say that they were entrepreneurs and doing something on their own. You still have to interact with people in the real world who you're not going to like.KONST:  Right. And it also suppresses people who are feeling some sort of they're being attacked. So if you're somebody who is being attacked but you're told that you're not allowed...(CROSSTALK)BREAM:  That you're the attacker.KONST:  Yes. That you're the attacker or if someone is being hostile towards you or you're feeling some sort of injustice, but you're being told-- as a lot of these institutions are saying now and Rutgers said this in the R.A.'s have issues this condemnation of anything that is not nice. That's literally the language that they use.So, if you're not saying something nice, it's not valid. So if you have some sort of critique of something that's been done to you, that doesn't fall in the lines of what he R.A.'s are saying you should say, that hurts the victim.BREAM:  Right.KONST:  If you don't have a space where you're free to say and feel what you want, that doesn't mean it's right, but that's what the other side is supposed to do. That's the essence of free press.BREAM:  Right.KONST:  You might have one perspective, but the other perspective cancels that out.BREAM:  Yes. We're going to leave it there. But I think this is a conversation that needs to continue.KONST:  That's right.BREAM:  Nomiki, always good to see you.KONST:  It's a pleasure, Shannon.BREAM:  All right. We will be right back on ""The Kelly File.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM:  Tonight before we go, some history on this day in 1944, former President George H.W. Bush came under heavy fire while conducting a bombing run in the Pacific theater during World War II. His plane was damaged beyond repair, but before crashing into the Pacific, the future president completed his bombing run on a Japanese installation.After bailing from the fiery aircraft, he floated in the Pacific for hours before being rescued by the USS Finback. What you're seeing now is rare footage of that moment. What an amazing man and story.That's it for ""The Kelly File."" Have a great Labor Day weekend. Thank you for watching. By the way, I did tell Alan Colmes he could call me for Twitter or for bail money. On Twitter, you're telling me just to leave him there. I won't do it. Have a great Labor Day weekend.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
