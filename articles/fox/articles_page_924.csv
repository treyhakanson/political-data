2	http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2013/01/14/year-in-fast-food/	The year in fast food 	"Every year, fast-food chains slowly expand overseas, launch new menu items, and try out new marketing themes. And while certain things, like the McRib's return, are an annual occurrence everyone expects to happen, other items (looking at you, dessert nachos) always capture the media's attention.Fast-casual chains like Applebee's don't count, but the chain's moves to be a more urban, hip establishment were mimicked by the fast-food category; other chains tried to add gourmet touches to their mass produced menus, launching ""fresher"" takes on classic menu items. There were some marketing faux pas along the way, some drama about politics, and a new movement to increase the wages of those working in the industry.So here it is: the year in fast food. Whether you're a fan of McDonald's, a Burger King advocate, or simply one who wants validation for their anti-fast-food habits, these stories look back on whether the fast-food chains of today are the same as those of yesteryear. And In-N-Out fans? Well, there weren't any expansions this year, so you're out of luck.Taco Bell Tried to Be Like ChipotleThe Mexican fusion fast food chain launched a menu that seemed suspiciously focused on burrito bowls, called the Cantina menu from Lorena Garcia (Top Chef). At the same time, Taco Bell solidified its reputation as stoner food of the world when they hinted at a Cool Ranch Doritos Locos taco, plus launched ""restaurant-sized"" nachos and churro desserts.Pizza Hut Went a Little Overboard With DealsFirst, they offered a ridiculous proposal package for Valentine's Day (every girl wants to celebrate with some pizza, obviously), then they offered free pizza for life for anyone who asked the presidential candidates their pizza topping preferences, sausage or pepperoni, during the presidential debates. Naturally, they rescinded the latter offer, because it was just dumb and people actually care about politics (true story), so when Christmas came around they just gave people $10 gift cards if they tweeted a photo of their lame Christmas present. Honestly though, we were really happy with our socks.Multiple Restaurants Launched More Adventurous Menu Items AbroadWendy's in Japan got a lobster and caviar burger, as well as a foie gras version, KFC put a weird cheese slice on top of their cheese top burger in the Philippines, and Burger King did crazy promotions that allowed this guy to put 1,050 rashers of bacon on his burger (not to mention that truffle burger in Hong Kong). In the meantime, McDonald's launched baguette sandwiches in France, fancy pretzel burgers in Germany, and wine in South America. We're waiting for our lobster rolls, Mickey D.McDonald's Tried to Be HealthyThe fast food giant launched a new, ""healthier"" Happy Meal with a smaller portion of fries and newly-added sliced apples. Then the chain promoted a healthier menu for the Olympics and decided to post calorie counts on all its menus, but that still didn't change the fact that McDonald's still has one of the unhealthiest ""healthy"" kids meals ever.Burger King Tried Desperately to Win Second Place BackEarlier this year, Wendy's beat Burger King as the number two fast-food burger chain in America (McDonald's was first, obviously). So naturally, Burger King did its best to win the title back. The chain tested a delivery service, signed on Mary J. Blige and David Beckham to do ads (one of which backfired), launched a bacon sundae, and even offered 55-cent Whoppers in honor of the 55-year-old Whopper.Click here for more fast food news from 2012More from The Daily Meal America's Unhealthiest Fast-Food Items  America's Best Bagels  12 Best Donut Shops in America  Best Burritos in America"

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The biggest story in all of politics is what's happening to the Republican Party, and I'm getting zero credit for it. And I should get all, because they're not coming in for little Marco, that I can tell you.SEN. MARCO RUBIO, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We can't win if we're divided against each other. We can't win if we have to spend six months convincing our own to vote for our frontrunner, to vote for our nominee.SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If we remain divided, Donald Trump wins. And the more we unite Republicans the more we're going to beat Donald.GOV. JOHN KASICH, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: All I'm suggesting is it looks increasingly, if I win Ohio, as though we will have a convention that will come together to pick I would think the adult in the room.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: OK. That's all today after last night's debate, of course, right here on FOX. Let's bring in our panel: Jason Riley, columnist with The Wall Street Journal; A.B. Stoddard, associate editor of The Hill, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. OK, Jason, fallout?JASON RILEY, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, that I think Ted Cruz had a very good night. I think he landed some body blows. I think bringing up the contributions that Donald Trump had made to Democrats over the decades was very, very effective. I think he was trying to explain to Republican voters that they are on the cusp of nominating someone who lacks really any sort of principles let along Republican principles or conservative principles.BAIER: You are not alone in that. This is Rush Limbaugh today post- debate.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: I think Ted Cruz was running rings around everybody in terms of awareness of the issues, knowledge of the issues, mastering whatever it was that was discussed. In terms of the old way that we used to consider qualifications for the presidency, the old way in which we used to analyze competence, Ted Cruz hit a grand slam homerun last night. But that's not how we make judgments on these things today.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: To his point, there is a new wave, and Donald Trump has figured out how to ride the wave of anger about Washington effectively, right, A.B.?A.B. STODDARD, THE HILL: Oh, yes. The establishment never understood the anger that he was connecting to and really kind of energizing, telling people you have really gotten the short end of the stick and telling them over and over, different groups, different places in different ways.The thing about when he has a bad debate, his supporters never care and they're never swayed. We've seen in 15 contests there are late deciders. So far they've mostly broken to Rubio. What you've seen with Cruz and Rubio, and then Kasich sort of over on the side who it thought also had a good night, is they refused to attack each other. So they're doing -- they're attacking Donald Trump trying to persuade late breakers and late deciders against Donald Trump. But they know none of them have a path on their own. They have to hang together. So even though they're not talking about it and they're not talking to each other, it is implicit that the only way to stop him as at the convention together.BAIER: I tried to point that out in that question early on to Kasich about how Romney essentially was laying out the blueprint. Kasich wins Ohio, Rubio wins Florida, Ted Cruz wins where he can win, and then you fight it out at the convention. Kasich obviously trying to play the adult in the room and that's how he is pitching that post-debate.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I think he did a good job of that, but it is a rather easy job, and it's not the most courageous, because, after all, he stands outside while Rubio and Cruz are hitting very hard at Trump to expose his weaknesses and to try to bring him down. If that doesn't happen, Governor Kasich has absolutely no chance at all. So he is allowing the others to do the dirty work.But it is clear that the strategy has changed. Until Super Tuesday, it would have been we need one guy to emerge one-on-one with Trump. It is now mathematically too late. So now they all understand that the only way to do it is everyone stays in the race, the anti-Trump forces. They each have to garner all the votes they can. Ohio has to go to Kasich. Rubio has to win in Florida. And then you deny Trump a majority. He gets a plurality, and then you work it out as to who is going to be the nominee. I would suggest two of them, perhaps Rubio and Cruz, go to Weehawken, New Jersey, and work it out the old fashioned way.(LAUGHTER)BAIER: Go ahead.RILEY: I was just going to say it is also the way that Rubio and Cruz have had to go after Trump, particularly Rubio. And you sense the un- comfortableness there. This is a guy who would much rather be discussing policy instead of the innuendos and so forth. But the way Trump has changed what is acceptable public discourse in this country is really troubling. You listen to some of what he says and you want to take a shower, Bret, when he's done. And I think that's very unfortunate.BAIER: There was a clean-up today, a clarification by Donald Trump after this particular question, it happened to be my question, last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Experts have said when you ask the U.S. military to carry out some of your campaign promises, specifically targeting terrorist families, and also the use of interrogation methods more extreme than waterboarding, the military will refuse because they've been trained to turn down and refuse illegal orders. So what would you do as commander in chief if the U.S. military refused to carry out those orders?TRUMP: They won't refuse. They're not going to refuse me. If we want to go stronger, I would go stronger too, because, frankly, that's the way I feel.(END VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Today, a statement came out saying ""I feel very, very strongly about the need to attack and kill those terrorists who attack and kill our people. I know people who died on 9/11. I will never forget those events. I will use every legal power that I have to stop these terrorist enemies. I do, however, understand that the United States is bound by laws and treaties, and I will not order our military or other official to violate those laws and will seek their advice on such matter. I will not order a military officer to disobey the law. It is clear that as president I will be bound by laws just like all Americans, and I will meet those responsibilities."" A.B.?STODDARD: Well, there was another reversal today on H-1B visas. So it was quite a busy day of clean-up. This is the argument the anti-Trump forces make, that he will not only do the things in his business practice that's he says he would never do and American workers should not to have put up with and that he's not serious enough on policy, but that he'll change his positions. You played two CNN clips, October 6th of 2015 and October 20, two weeks apart, two different policies on Afghanistan. And that's the argument they're driving, that he has no core principles.It is not flexibility and evolution in changing your mind as you learn more about a subject, but that he'll just switch on a dime. And today he was chastened, obviously, about the need to as a potential commander in chief respect and obey the law especially when it comes to military orders. This is the core of the argument, that he will change his mind and the minute he's the nominee, they fear he will become Hillary Clinton with different hair.KRAUTHAMMER: It may not be a winning argument. Flip-flop, contradict yourself, that an old charge. I think it could ironically help him because the reason for the anti-Trump force is this guy is out of control. He is extreme. He'll order illegal acts to our military, et cetera. Can't have him in office. I think the retreats he is making on all the fronts perhaps will hurt him on those on consistency, but it could help with people who are ordinary, run-of-the-mill Republican who don't want a man out of control in the White House. And it says in the end he is flexible even on immigration and he'll be OK.BAIER: All right, it is Friday, and that means we head down to a place called Candidate Casino. And you have $100 in chips. Who is going to get the nomination? Jason.RILEY: I am giving $70 to Donald Trump. He has got a significant lead. It is not insurmountable but it is large. I am going to give $15 each to Rubio and Cruz. I think mathematically they're still in it, but it's a very tough road that they have ahead of them.BAIER: A.B.?STODDARD: I gave $80 to Trump like I did last week. And I don't want know if Charles is going to raise his draw here, but I'm really going bold on this. And last week I think I had $15 on Rubio. I'm going $5 with each guy and $5 on other because we just don't know. But other has as good a chance as the three.BAIER: OK, Charles?KRAUTHAMMER: I think you guys are right on.BAIER: Drumroll.KRAUTHAMMER: Trump, $80. Cruz, $10. Rubio, $5.BAIER: Can we talk about the evolution here?KRAUTHAMMER: When the facts change, my opinions change. The important explanation is the Prozac because my despondency is such right now that wine, women, and song is not going to do it.STODDARD: When was whiskey?KRAUTHAMMER: I have to go to anti-depressants. But the good news is I can write the prescription myself.(LAUGHTER)BAIER: Finally, I want to go down the row here, this news in our show. We had confirmation that Secretary Clinton, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton is going to join our Democratic town hall in Detroit. She has agreed on participate alongside Senator Sanders. We'll have studio audience there in Detroit. I will be moderating that 6:00 to 7:00 Monday. It will repeat at 11:00 eastern time. Jason, what about that?RILEY: About her appearing, well, I think it is a smart thing to do. I think she is trying to appeal to I think some these voters that watch FOX News. I think that is part of her strategy, getting into some of these things, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and so forth, the industrial Midwest, voters that she didn't do well enough with in 2008, so I think she thinks she has an audience.BAIER: Maybe this has to do with Michigan?STODDARD: I think she's seen internal polling that says there are ant- trade Bernie supporters who could be Trump supporters in the fall if she's not the nominee, and she decided to join the bandwagon.BAIER: We're glad to have her.KRAUTHAMMER: Look, she is a weak candidate but her strong point is debates, town halls. She has beaten him on those measures a lot in the last few months. So I give him an open field.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino, along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Eric Bolling and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""Israel is on high alert and fighting back against Palestinians after a string of new attacks. Instead of standing by our closest ally in the Middle East, the Obama administration is accusing Israel of terrorism.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN KIRBY, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: I would say that in -- certainly individuals on both sides of this divide are -- have proven capable of and in our view, guilty of acts of terror.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: State Department Spokesman John Kirby stood by that remark today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KIRBY: I think I will just reiterate of what we said before and we'll continue to stress it. That the violence needs to stop, there's no excuse for intentional killing of innocent people for the use of terror as a tactic.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: And always well-coordinated, so did the White House.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The United States mourns any loss of innocent life, whether it's Israeli or it's Palestinian. It is our view that both sides have a responsibility to exercise restraint.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Earlier, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of spreading lies about the violence and warned the world not to confuse his country's victims with their attackers.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAEL PRIME MINISTER: We expect all our friends and anyone concerned with the facts and the truth to look at these facts, to see the truth and not to draw false symmetry between Israeli citizens, and those who would stab them and knife them to death.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: All right, we'll take it on the table. Eric, I think that Netanyahu showed a little bit of restraint there because people are being attacked, and yes, there has been violence in attacks against Israelis. If an Israeli then defends themselves or defends another Israeli by attacking that attacker, I would say that that is not terrorism. That is self-defense or defending themselves.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: And that is this few attacks over the last few days. Over the history of the last 25 years, the Israelis, they're not the -- they're the ones that are getting the missiles shot at them and they go back and they take out the places that the missiles were being shot from. These attacks now we know, if you watch the videos, they're -- Palestinian drives up to the bus stop, takes the bus stop out, hits somebody, hacks away at that person, hacks away at another person, an Israeli comes up and shoots him and now this guy is being called the terrorist? I don't know why, there are only close ally in the Middle East. We should be embracing that friendship, that alliance instead of calling them out. Notice Israelis response, not only Netanyahu, but Ron Dormer, the other -- the deputy Knesset member, they're very hesitant to call out President Obama specifically. Even though things have gotten worse under President Obama, they still say United States is our friend. We have a great alliance with the United States. It's not their fault. We just need to call attention to what's really going on.PERINO: In the last couple of days, Greg you've been noticing and commenting on the media coverage.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: It's amazing. They don't call it terror, they call it tension. And whenever there's any defense that is called a heavy-handed tactic. So when a man comes with -- at you with a knife and you shoot them that is a heavy-handed tactic. And then, we have to remind everybody, these are coordinated knife attack by Palestinian young men to foment a war. It reminds me of zombie movies when -- like Dawn of the Dead, when all of a sudden out of nowhere, some crazy maniac comes at you and stabs you or kills you. This is actually what Israel is experiencing every day. And what -- the media does is they equate both sides as creating violence. That's like a man who would push a woman in front of a bus. It's the same as the man who rescues her. Just because they happen to be there at the same time. It's absolutely disgusting. And watching -- I was at the gym watching on MSNBC and I was -- they must have thought I was crazy because I'm yelling at the TV like, you know, a 75- year-old man and it's -- it leaves you speechless, the media should be ashamed of themselves.PERINO: Juan, when the administration doesn't distinguish between the youth attacking Israelis and then the Israelis responding, if they equate that, I mean, doesn't that incite more of the terrorist acts by the Palestinian youth?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, I hope not because I think that you have a situation here where it requires some historical context, which is, of course, that we're talking about Jerusalem and about the Israeli assertion that that's their capital, including east Jerusalem. Which is nobody acknowledges this but -- and then you have, not Greg, somehow a coordinated effort by, you know, some Palestinian terror group, but individuals. I think everybody agrees these are individual kids acting out.GUTFELD: Coordinated.WILLIAMS: I don't know that it's coordinated. I think the kids.GUTFELD: It's coordinated.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Do you think it's just coincidence that there are all of these knife attacks?WILLIAMS: No. What Dana said is true, our social media.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: As opposed to a terrorist group.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: Which is what we had in previous intifadas, right? So that's not what's on the table. And then you have the Israelis using the military, not police sources, but the military in response. It's not some guy who says, I saw someone stab somebody on the bus and I responded. It's now the Israeli.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: It's what Eric is talking about really happened.BOLLING: Yeah.GUTFELD: I watched the film.BOLLING: Yeah, we watched the film.GUTFELD: We watched it. A car drove into a bus stop with elderly people, ran them over, he got out he stabbed them and thank God some guy comes out of nowhere with a gun and shoots him.WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: And then the guy gets -- the Palestinian gets up.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: Starts grabbing, swinging the knife again.WILLIAMS: But nobody -- this is true.BOLLING: This big, Juan. He gets shot a third and a fourth time.WILLIAMS: You were -- you're telling the truth, but you're ignoring the part about the Israeli military.BOLLING: But what's -- Juan, so what's the military stopping coordinated attacks?GUTFELD: How dare they do their job?WILLIAMS: No.BOLLING: What's wrong with that?WILLIAMS: I'm just saying you have.BOLLING: What's wrong with that?WILLIAMS: Because I think for most of the world they say wait a second, this is the Israeli military, not even the police force.PERINO: But you don't think -- but you think this is like random acts of violence? I mean, it's actually.WILLIAMS: No, I disagree with you.PERINO: Let see, what Greg is describing, Kimberly, is what terror -- the definition of terrorism. So trying to attack and kill innocent people to achieve a political aim. That's the definition of a terrorist attack. So why wouldn't the military fight back on the terrorist attack? I don't.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Well right. They would be remiss if they didn't. They would be shirking their obligations and their duties if they didn't do that. I don't understand why Israel has to sit there and lay down and take it and become, you know, victims of terrorism. They have every right to defend themselves and to stand up against it. With whatever force they need to use, to shut it down. Because if they see that that's a weak target and people can go in and do this and everybody wants to gang up on Israel, blame U.S., blame Israel as the bad guys in this, I don't play that game.WILLIAMS: I think if it's love of Israel, it's nobody -- and United States is the number one ally of Israel, OK?GUILFOYLE: But you wouldn't know.WILLIAMS: And I don't think that.GUILFOYLE: From the rhetoric and the lack of diplomacy towards Israel by this administration. That's a problem.WILLIAMS: On the contrary, I think the Iran deal, I think everything has been aimed to try and solidify Israel's standing.GUILFOYLE: You do realize that Bibi Netanyahu is like the calling out the president.WILLIAMS: That's Netanyahu.GUILFOYLE: The administration who's been going.WILLIAMS: That's Netanyahu's failure as a leader with a lack of vision.GUILFOYLE: Oh my, gosh. I don't get it.WILLIAMS: But I'm saying, you got to understand and.BOLLING: Wait, wait.WILLIAMS: And this is what's coming -- hold on.BOLLING: You're not suggesting the Israeli people are in favor of the Iran -- U.S.-Iran deal.GUILFOYLE: That's what he said.WILLIAMS: No, I said Netanyahu.BOLLING: But Netanyahu is.WILLIAMS: Netanyahu.BOLLING: Is talking to them?WILLIAMS: I think Netanyahu has done a bad job of leadership.BOLLING: And he's representing the Israeli.GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: Almost across the board.GUILFOYLE: And the people's interest.WILLIAMS: OK, OK, let me just say, this.GUILFOYLE: That's like Juan thinks like we hooked up Israel by getting in bed with, you know, Iran and doing this deal.WILLIAMS: How about we protect and say no to Iran getting a nuke, and Iran saying they wanted to remove Israel from the earth.GUILFOYLE: Dream on in the land of unicorns, Juan.WILLIAMS: But I'm just saying -- I'm just saying right now, everybody is talking about a two-state solution and that's why I think you hear the administration saying, ""Hey, slow down. Everybody slow down."" This is -- this could cycle out of control and everybody suddenly find.PERINO: Well, I agree.WILLIAMS: That we're in trouble.PERINO: I agree with that and I think that's why Netanyahu today actually was trying to be very calm about it, but you do have a problem when the secretary of state with declining influence in the Middle East says, ""I'm going to go and try to fix it."" But he has actually the one who said that it was because of an increasing number of settlements. And actually, it was even a bigger quote than that like more than ever. Well Elliott Abrams who has been in Israeli-U.S. domestic politics for a long time, actually points out, it's not true, like less elements under Netanyahu than previous ones. So it's dangerous rhetoric like that. That's careless. I think that feeds into it.GUTFELD: Where is the call for knife control by Piers Morgan and Barack Obama? Where is that?BOLLING: You know what the interesting thing, though, Juan is, is if it is the Israeli military who are thwarting these terror attacks, wow, great, they've declared a war on terror. We can't even say we have terrorists here. We.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: I would prefer their tactics over what we're doing, pretending it doesn't exist.WILLIAMS: I don't think anybody is denying what's going on. I think that's the difference. Everybody at this table, I think in the world sees that you have these Palestinian kids.BOLLING: Workplace violence.WILLIAMS: Let me finish.BOLLING: Workplace violence when 13 or 14, depending on your view of the pregnant person being killed, that was declared workplace violence.GUTFELD: This will be called road rage.WILLIAMS: OK, let me just say.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: All right, back to my point. Nobody in the world is denying that you've had these Palestinian kids perpetrating acts of violence.GUTFELD: Will you stop calling them kids?WILLIAMS: Or teenagers. What do you want me to call them?GUTFELD: Young adults.WILLIAMS: OK, young adults.GUTFELD: With knives.BOLLING: Young terrorists.WILLIAMS: All right, OK. Whatever you want to call them, all right? Let's not play games. So they're perpetrating acts of violence against Israelis. Now, you're thinking is oh yeah, bring in the military and the biggest armaments and that will stop them? Answer, no.BOLLING: How about bring anything?WILLIAMS: It's a lot of social media. And these kids are angry at the fact that the Israelis have come in and taking control of the.GUILFOYLE: You can hit the problem from other directions, Juan, but you're naive to think that you can't respond and should not respond with force and strong measure to shut it down.WILLIAMS: I just don't think.GUILFOYLE: They can go ahead and do their PR campaigns or social media, but you shouldn't sit there and.WILLIAMS: I wish to stop it.GUILFOYLE: See them get slaughtered like a lamb.WILLIAMS: And nobody is asking about you get stop. I just want it to stop and I don't think that tremendous overwhelming show of force is what's going to somehow dissuade this kid that he can achieve martyrdom by a knife attack.PERINO: I would send that more.GUTFELD: Yeah, I mean the thing is -- it is incremental progress when you kill somebody with a knife, which progress I'm willing to take. If that person has a knife, I would want my people to have a gun.PERINO: Can I do one more topic just because we have two minutes.GUTFELD: No, I've had enough, I'm out of here.PERINO: OK, please? All right, James Comey, he is the FBI director. He had a warning about ISIS here in America.(LAUGHTER)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR: That group is using social media to try to motivate people. Either come to their so-called caliphate, or if you can't come, kill where you are. The terrorist is buzzing in the pocket of a troubled soul, 24 hours a day through Twitter. And we have investigations in all 50 states to try to identify among hundreds of people who are consuming this poison.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: So Kimberly, how does the FBI -- another law enforcement coordinate to keep up with that?GUILFOYLE: Well yeah, I think it's very difficult, but I do feel confident that he understands the nature and extent of the problem. That it is something that we have to deal with cyber terrorism, the use of social media. A very active network to recruit young people that are feeling disenfranchised and disenchanted with the way government is or trying to join up with the cause to try to become one with something so there is that we have that same problem in the United States with gangs that we see in impoverished neighborhoods or areas, communities that struggle, socioeconomically. So you have to be able to find some kind of measure to draw those people in because they're there for the taking. Whose side are you going to let them play for?PERINO: I think all of the presidential candidates there should have to answer what their counterinsurgency plan is against the digital media war that we're engaged in.BOLLING: And I would hope that they will all say, like we've said right here over the two years. I think last year, Comey made that same statement.PERINO: But he said there were open investigations in all 50 states.BOLLING: Open investigation is all 50 states, so he really -- look, they're on it and that's the good news. And anyone that thinks they should back off any sort of spending on Intel is out of their mind. You need to press the Intel number. Give them all the resources they need. I just don't know what the answer is. I don't know that you know, clearly, ISIS is big and growing and becoming a bigger threat and more and more young people are disillusion are jumping into the fray for some reason. I don't.PERINO: I just.BOLLING: I have no clue with -- how do you solve that problem?PERINO: Well, I think there's an upcoming article in Foreign Affairs magazine by Jared Cohen from Google ideas, who has done a lot of this work, and one of the things he says is that ISIS actually has this hierarchy where they're all fix (ph) -- there's like a small number of people, guys, that work on the social media piece and then they have fake accounts, but they go into real accounts and so they're protected, but if there's some way that social media, such as Twitter can find out to cut that head off, then we will maybe.WILLIAMS: Can I just mention one thing here, with that came as a surprise to me was FBI also said today, number one source of terrorist attacks in the United States is not ISIS, but it's domestic terrorism and mostly from white supremacist groups.GUTFELD: And they're wrong.WILLIAMS: Oh, they're wrong?GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: Why is that Greg?GUTFELD: The amazing thing about this whole event is everybody blames George Bush for this instability that is created ISIS. They're wrong. Because it was actually way, it was more stable back then, seven years later, Captain Cumulus, who coined Kimberly's phrase.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: Has screwed Iraq, Libya, Syria, and allowed ISIS to thrive. Under Obama, the Middle East has become the middle beast. It's his game. And he's losing it.PERINO: And we didn't get to the third topic, which I -- for which I apologize, it was Afghanistan and the president switching his position yet again, there's more coming up on that on Special Report.All right, coming up, Hillary Clinton wants everyone to stop pestering her about her e-mails and one former government employee has something to say about that. He says, his life was ruined for leaking unclassified material and you're going to hear from him, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Hillary Clinton has been mocking the FBI's investigation of her e-mails every chance she gets.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Tonight, I want to talk not about my e-mails, but about what the American people want from the next president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, D-VT., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The secretary is right. And that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e- mails.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Thank you. Me, too, me, too.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Today, a former NSA official and others spoke at the National Press Club about how their lives were ruined for cases far less compromising than Clinton's. They were aggressively prosecuted under the Espionage Act for sharing information. Some of which was not classified to expose alleged government misconduct. Thomas Drake thinks there's a double standard.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)THOMAS DRAKE, FORMER SENIOR NSA EXECUTIVE: This is the secretary of state, one of the most targeted individuals by other intelligence agencies and entities in the world, using a private server to traffic a highly sensitive information, and no doubt, including classified information, and no doubt, information including sources and methods. But hey, I'm secretary of state, even Obama gave her cover.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: And no doubt, a double standard, Dana.PERINO: I'm glad that somebody is finally coming out and saying this. I mean the government employees are under very strict instructions in order to get a top-secret clearance. Her judgment is, is so bad, I would imagine it would be pretty easy for the Justice Department to put together a case because you do have individuals like Thomas, who have lost their careers, their livelihoods and have had to deal with the fact that now they have a record, right? How you know how hard it is to get a good job when you have a record like that? So I think that it is good that they have finally come out because there's surely, more people like for example the marine that Greg mentioned, who is being discharged, dishonorably discharged for sending an e-mail on a private server because he was trying to warn people to get out of the way of a coming terrorist attack.GUILFOYLE: Unbelievable, yeah.PERINO: The other thing that came out today was in her e-mails, it turns out that her e-mail server was so poor that often didn't work. And so her staff couldn't send her e-mails so she would send State Department business from her personal e-mail account to their personal e-mail accounts, that came out today from the AP.GUILFOYLE: Unbelievable. I mean you just can't -- it's so glaring, you know the contrast of what's happening with her account. Other people were treated, you know, Petraeus and others. Bolling, what's the justification and why shouldn't the media care about it and keep talking about it?BOLLING: We should.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: I take -- I push back on one thing that that gentleman said. He said even President Obama provided cover for Hillary Clinton, he didn't. In that 60 Minutes interview, he kind of threw her under the bus. He kind of said, we never condoned doing what he did with your e-mail server, it was a mistake. He apologized and we should maybe move on, but he definitely brought more light, shed more light on it.WILLIAMS: I say -- he said there was no national security issue.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: We don't really know yet.PERINO: But then I have to say that he walked that back the next day.BOLLING: We don't really know. Here are a couple of quick thoughts. Bernie Sanders gave Hillary Clinton cover. He is the only one who did. Now there's a subplot going on that the day after the debate, Mark Helprin reported that Bernie Sanders was supposed to be eviscerating Hillary Clinton for the e-mails when he delivered the line, but he delivered it improperly, so it looked like he was giving her cover. The Sanders campaign has since pushed back on that, so that's a little subplot going on, but here's the big thing, 30,000 e-mails were scrubbed by Hillary Clinton, right? I would love, love to know if someone could get their hands on those 30,000 somehow. They've got to be somewhere, right?GUILFOYLE: I mean we have.BOLLING: They got to be.PERINO: How president.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: You know in China.BOLLING: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: I'm sure they have them, for sure. Start there. Good start -- yeah, for your shopping. Juan?WILLIAMS: Well, there's no evidence there was any breach. I mean, if there was, boy, would we have something to talk about at this table, and so.PERINO: How could they not?GUTFELD: But you have against.WILLIAMS: Yes, there was.GUTFELD: This table, Juan.WILLIAMS: Well, I'm OK.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: This table is.WILLIAMS: Well there is.GUTFELD: This table that.WILLIAMS: Let me say.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: This table is a little bit -- this table a little tilted. A little tilted.GUTFELD: It's balanced.WILLIAMS: So it's a very special table, Gregory. And I just think when you look at what's going on here, the problem is for this table, Gregory, that the democrats don't give a hoot and a holler about this issue.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Disappointed.GUTFELD: It's their guy.WILLIAMS: Disappointed.GUTFELD: You know what you actually spoke the truth.WILLIAMS: Thank you.GUTFELD: You meant to say media, but you said democrats because of the same thing.WILLIAMS: I said that.GUTFELD: The media laughs. The media laughs.WILLIAMS: Are you kidding?GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: The New York Times is all over her.GUTFELD: With the exempt, I'm talking about during the debate. When you heard the laughter among the media, that's why the debate was a sham because they had the opportunity to question her on the fact that she put the country at risk and they didn't. I trust her with national security like I would trust Michael Moore with my dessert. She has no business being in the oval office. She has no business being in any kind of control. She - - what she did to this country was dangerous and, the fact that they paint accountability as somehow an attack? So that means you can never investigate anything. Why investigate anything?WILLIAMS: What do you mean?(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Yeah, when she will going to attack?GUTFELD: We can't investigate her because it's a witch-hunt. OK, nevermind.PERINO: And will she pardon all of these individuals like Thomas, who were prosecuted for it.WILLIAMS: Thomas was not secretary of state.PERINO: No, but -- does she, do you think that she actually has credibility with people in the national security industry?WILLIAMS: I don't think that's up to them. That's like us challenging.PERINO: Because she wants to be commander-in-chief.WILLIAMS: That's -- look, that's up to the voters. Go right ahead.PERINO: I'm asking you, though. Do you think she has credibility with them?WILLIAMS: You're taking the Democrat attitude that, you know what, republicans are so anxious to take her down and.PERINO: No. I actually -- you know what, don't fall for this, republicans. This is the whole thing of like democrats, basically saying that I'm trying to help the democrats? No.WILLIAMS: Democrats.PERINO: The Democrats were always going to move in lockstep behind her, anyway. You actually have to look for the truth, regardless of where it lies.GUTFELD: It's great, it's great. It's like, hey, you know every time you try to call her out on her incompetence, you're an investigator, you're helping her.PERINO: Right.GUTFELD: That's so you don't do that.PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: Wait a minute.GUTFELD: It's like a reverse.WILLIAMS: That hope is the FBI is investigating?GUTFELD: Yeah, I know.WILLIAMS: OK.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, we want that. Let's see what happens then and see how trivial what matter it is to you at that point, Juan.WILLIAMS: All right.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: I'm going to visit her when she's in jail.WILLIAMS: Is that right?GUTFELD: Oh, yeah.WILLIAMS: And Joe Biden is going to run.GUILFOYLE: I don't think she's going to be accepting.PERINO: And a week from today her testimony on Capitol Hill on the Benghazi committee.GUTFELD: I'm going to put a file in her cake.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Ahead, Donald Trump reflects back on his campaign, thus far for the White House. Plus, he previews his upcoming ""SNL"" appearance, that's all next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: As NBC announced that Donald Trump will host ""Saturday Night Live,"" Trump also spoke to that network about things that he said in the past. Hmm, I wonder if he could probably have said fewer things about certain things. But honestly, he's very happy with the way it's going.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, MSNBC)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I could probably have said fewer things about certain things. But honestly, I'm very happy with the way it's going.I never look back. I like to look forward. I like to learn from the past and I have learned.I can watch my words a little bit, maybe be a little more politically correct. But to be honest with you, I think one of the reasons I am doing well is because I don't want to -- being politically correct takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of effort. We don't have time in this country. Our country is really in trouble.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: He's right. Being politically correct is time-consuming, but being politically incorrect is not a cover for being crude.But Trump's a figure who can navigate both swamps of pop culture and politics. He's the first Republican to swim downstream from celebrity as a statesman. His power is that he can do ""Saturday Night Live"" in his sleep. His challenge, however is that we expect more when he's awake.So while I'm all for the skits, you can't be sketchy with world politics. Time for specifics. This race goes beyond an emotional high one gets from bold jabs on Twitter. Trump must put out, not put down.His old strategy, ""I won't show you my hand until I get the job,"" it's OK with groupies, but he wouldn't take that from a contractor, and we can't from a candidate, either. We already tried that, remember?So we need evidence that he's thinking of the big stuff in a practical manner. That means Islamic extremism, non-state terror, cyber terror, the changing demands of national security.As the world unravels, your standard for leadership shouldn't be, ""He's politically incorrect.""  It's, ""Can he persuade the rest of America that he can govern?"" Maybe that will be a skit.So Kimberly, how do you think he's going to do it on ""Saturday Night Live""?  He's done it before. He's one of the few Republicans who can pull this stuff off.GUILFOYLE: I think he's going to crush it. I really do. I think it will be one of their highest rated. I'm looking forward to seeing it. I bet you he's really going to answer the call. He's going to be himself. He's very good impromptu. He's got a lot of confidence. And when he's been on the tack shows...GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: ... you know, the late-night shows, he's done great. He was fantastic with Jimmy Fallon, too. So sit back, pop the popcorn.GUTFELD: I'm tired of popcorn.Dana, let's admit: he can be very charming when he's self-deprecating.PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: And he under -- like in that interview, he just seems to be such a good person. It's when he gets up, and he starts repeating the platitudes that he gets...PERINO: Well, there's definite benefit of being comfortable in front of the camera.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: And having done ""Saturday Night Live"" before, then that's easier.And also, when you show up in person, in my experience, they're almost always nicest to you. OK. It's very rare that they would actually go after him in a way that is not flattering in some way to him. So it's a good decision on his part.On one of the things that you mentioned on world affairs, so this morning - - I think it was this morning, but within the last 24 hours -- he was talking about the report of -- from the Dutch government that said that the plane that was taken down in Ukraine was from a Russian missile.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: And today, Donald Trump questioned that and said, ""Well, we don't know if that's true. Maybe we'll never really know."" But I think that when you want to be the leader of the free world, when you have one of their allies that does an independent investigation, you should at least back them up.GUTFELD: There's -- so we talked about that. There's something about Putin and Trump. He must be building hotels in Moscow. I don't know what it is. But he's like, you know, ""He's not a bad guy.""So -- so Eric, I have a feeling that the ""SNL"" crew will be more intimidated by him than he will be intimidated by them.BOLLING: I don't know. I think he -- he does so well in those situations.  Like you said, he can be self-deprecating. They can probably even do anti- Trump skits, and he'll pull it off.PERINO: He'll laugh. Right.BOLLING: He'll laugh. He has that skill.Asking -- great monologue. Very smart to go like, yes, he's awesome in this. But yes, he could also use work here. I'm not sure where, if you like him or if you don't like him.GUTFELD: I've always been -- I've always been here for Donald, as an educator.BOLLING: Got you, got you.GUTFELD: You know what. I can offer my assistance, my brain to help him out.GUILFOYLE: And your eyebrows.BOLLING: The way I see the things -- you want specifics, right?GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: You want to see specifics. You may not get the specifics, because he may not have them. He's got an immigration plan. He's got a tax plan. He's got things. But what he does very smartly, and he brings up names of very, very smart people in business, in government.GUTFELD: Carl Icahn.BOLLING: Friends of his.GUTFELD: It's always Carl Icahn.BOLLING: But when you think of that, wouldn't you rather have that anyway?GUILFOYLE: I think he's running...BOLLING: Wouldn't you rather have, rather than a President Obama who says, ""I know everything, so I'm going to sign away on everything that I believe,"" surrounded -- that person surrounded with really smart people and let them help them, that organization come to a decision?GUTFELD: The only thing I worry about is that imagine if he was on the ""The Apprentice,"" and somebody said, ""Look, I'm not going to sell any cupcakes today. Once you hire me, I'm going to go sell those cupcakes.""He's going to say, ""You're fired.""WILLIAMS: Or how about this: ""I'm going to get Eric and Greg and Dana and Kimberly to sell those cupcakes. They're great people, so elect me and trust that I will pick up"" -- it's ridiculous.GUTFELD: That's what they do with Fox News.WILLIAMS: Well, I know, but wait. That was going to be my point for this segment.So NBC cuts ties with Donald Trump and ""The Apprentice"" over his, you know, calumny against Hispanics, right? But now, for ratings, oh, the Donald's back in the game. And he will, as Kimberly said...GUILFOYLE: He's going to kill it.WILLIAMS: He's going to bring out big numbers.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: Everybody's going to watch. Now is he, in fact, because he's so bombastic -- I think he can be easily punctured by comics and critics and skeptics and the like. The question is how he feels about it. And I think he's just going to get into it.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: I think he will, as you said -- he will kill it.GUILFOYLE: I said he's going to crush it.WILLIAMS: Crush it.PERINO: I think anybody that shows up and is willing to play along will do pretty well there.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: But he'll do...GUILFOYLE: He's going to do great. He's going to get -- he's going to get more supporters, I think, because people are going to see that side of him; and maybe that's enough for some. You just never know.PERINO: And there's high expectations for him. If you don't do well, then it will be embarrassing.GUTFELD: Yes. Is there anybody in that field of Republicans that -- I mean, I think Christie could do it.BOLLING: Ben Carson can do it.PERINO: Yes.BOLLING: I think most of them could do it. Greg, the writing, right?  I mean, they have the team of writers that can put together, anyone can be funny.GUTFELD: I think Lindsey Graham would be the best.WILLIAMS: How about we surround Donald Trump with a bunch of women and Hispanics.BOLLING: (UNINTELLIGIBLE). He might not be able to pull that off.WILLIAMS: Yes, yes.PERINO: Santorum might have a hard time.GUTFELD: Santorum. That would be troubling.OK. Ahead, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, and my squash partner, has found himself back in the news, this time for deflating one of the world's most popular soft drinks. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: Only one Democrat on the stage Tuesday night said that all lives matter, when they were given a choice between saying black lives matter and all lives matter. So that one candidate was Jim Webb. Two prominent African-Americans, though, have some words for the rest.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SHERIFF DAVID CLARKE, MILWAUKEE COUNTY, WISCONSIN: It was plantation politics in its finest hour. The continued enslavement of black people emotionally by the Democrat Party with this destructive liberal ideology.  And they know it. They're whoring for votes. They know that's what they're doing. The liberal ideology has been very destructive for the black community for the last 50 or 60 years.BEN CARSON, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Of course all lives matter. And all lives includes black lives. And we have to stop submitting to those who want to divide us up into all of these special interest groups and start thinking about what works for everybody. There are a lot of policies that this administration embraced that hurt black lives, that hurt all people who are in the underclass.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Kimberly, Sheriff Clarke, Ben Carson, I think they're right.  Clearly, all lives matter. But to me it's a political context up on the debate stage, where you have the Democrats not wanting to antagonize the Black Lives Matter group, for fear of possibly losing black political support in the Democratic primaries. What do you think?GUILFOYLE: I never stand down to bullies.WILLIAMS: Even in a political -- when you're trying to win someone's vote?GUILFOYLE: No. Then who are you? Who are you? You're somebody who's a sell-out, then, because you know what you're saying is not right. You're doing it anyway, because you're pandering. You're trying to steal votes from people by saying something that you know is not true. I'm not into that.WILLIAMS: Well, Eric, you now what? I think -- this is interesting. I said what I think is interesting. How crazy am I? But I just think -- in fact, I think if Black Lives Matter said all lives matter, they would potentially bring in more support for themselves.GUILFOYLE: But they don't want to. Their group.BOLLING: It would undermine their exact...GUILFOYLE: They're going to defund their group.BOLLING: ... mantra. Their whole point is specifically pointing out that there's an issue with police and...WILLIAMS: Well, that's right.BOLLING: ... the African-American community.WILLIAMS: No, that's right. But don't you think, Dana, the kid -- that when they say that you can't say all lives matter, then people who disagree with them say that's a problem.PERINO: I think you're forgetting one thing and all of us are. A lot of different politicians have tried to meet with them. Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush.And -- OK, sorry. I know we have to go in a minute, after Greg. I was just finishing a thought.Is that at the DNC meeting, then they actually passed a resolution saying, ""OK, we hear you, Black Lives Matter. We get it.""And the Black Lives Matter people rejected it, because it wasn't strong enough. So even when you try to talk to them, they push back against you.WILLIAMS: So Greg, are they -- is it the case that, if you say all lives matter, that you are somehow diminishing Black Lives Matter and the issue of excessive use of force by police?GUTFELD: They should tell Hillary all lies matter.You make a deal with the devil the moment you embrace identity politics.PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: Because then you know that you need to foment division in order to exist.Unity is the enemy of identity politics, so you're willing to actually create a fractious country in order to get power. And there's nothing scarier to a white leftist, than an Africon [SIC], what I call black conservatives. A black conservative, who's a walking, breathing rejection of that phony toxic ideology. And like, if a white liberal gets on an elevator and there's a black conservative, they will take the stairs.WILLIAMS: I'm afraid I've seen them take the stairs.Don't move. ""The Fastest Seven"" -- it is a really good ""Fastest Seven"" -- up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Welcome back, time for...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GRAPHIC: Fastest 7(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: ...

The spiral which began last year culminated in in this 911 call from Tuesday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Please hurry. He's blood coming out of his nose, white stuff coming out of his mouth. Can't get him to wake up. He's like almost not breathing.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK, is he conscious?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Excuse me?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is he conscious?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right, Juan, we're going to go to you. Bad things were going on. But for some reason I just -- I still feel bad for the guy.WILLIAMS: I think everybody feels bad. It's just an awful situation.  And, you know, someone with that kind of career -- he was in the NBA 14 years -- it's just -- I don't understand. Why does a guy like that, in that place -- and people are enabling. But I'm serious...GUTFELD: No, I mean, he's a guy.WILLIAMS: You and I are guys.GUTFELD: By the way, he was in a whorehouse doing drugs. I mean...WILLIAMS: Is that a way to go?BOLLING: I feel sorry for him, because...GUTFELD: It's a way to go.WILLIAMS: What do you mean?BOLLING: If you got to go?GUTFELD: I mean, I guess I have sympathy, but there are people that die in horrible, horrible ways that I have sympathy for.WILLIAMS: But he's self-destructive.GUTFELD: Yes. There's a lot of people -- but there's a lot of people in this world who are self-destructive.BOLLING: K.G.GUILFOYLE: Self-reflection?GUTFELD: I'm reading a book on empathy.GUILFOYLE: That's a long time coming, by the way. Start over on page one.GUTFELD: No, I feel bad for him. I feel bad for him. But we know that bad things were going on there.GUILFOYLE: I feel badly for him and for the family. But you know, at least they're there to support him. But it doesn't look good from all the reports. Very troubling.BOLLING: Dana.PERINO: I don't know what to say, because I'm not -- I'm not really aware of him. But I do recognize the drug abuse in this country is very serious.  And I think that you're going to see a lot more focus on this issue in the presidential election.BOLLING: Yes.PERINO: And partly it's not only -- it's abuse such as this. But it's the lower level, the debate. The Drug Enforcement Agency today did a raid on 13 cities to go after synthetic Chinese drugs that people are taking. And it's just a really serious issue, and innocent people are dying.GUTFELD: The one other thing that drives me crazy, is I don't understand why 9-11 -- 911 calls are public. Because that keeps people from calling 911. When somebody is dying, you think to yourself, that's a celebrity that's dying. I'm not going to make the phone call, because I'm going to be on TV.BOLLING: All right. Got to move on. Next up, we know Fallon does a funny Donald Trump impression. But check this out: Fallon doing Trump and David Alan Grier doing a pretty darn good Ben Carson on ""The Tonight Show"" last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SANDERS: And that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails.CLINTON : Thank you, thank you.JIMMY FALLON, HOST, NBC'S ""THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JIMMY FALLON"": I don't get this guy.

And my whisper is only audible to dogs, watch.(SOUND EFFECTS: DOG GROWLING)FALLON: Down boy, down boy.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: No. 1 and two GOPers.GUTFELD: I have to say this is, one of the primary reasons why Ben Carson should be president. It will revive the career of David Alan Grier. He's now working again.BOLLING: K.G., do you like this one?GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh. Yes, I mean, it's funny. And I'm sure, you know, that Ben and the Donald think it's funny, too. I mean, they're the winners right now. They're in the top two spots, and this is what we're getting attention on things like ""SNL."" They're a reflection, a mirror of what's going on right now in the 2016 election.WILLIAMS: Just a moment. Just a moment.GUILFOYLE: We'll see a lot more of it.WILLIAMS: As someone who likes Ben Carson, knows Ben Carson, Ben Carson is not fat.GUILFOYLE: No, he's not. I told you that I find Ben Carson to be very handsome.WILLIAMS: Well, thank you, but I'm just saying, look at this guy.GUILFOYLE: I don't know why they put padding in his stomach.PERINO: I don't know why he didn't sit up.

We believe that Frosted Flakes are actually -- is a food. You just keep eating those things, and you keep wondering why, you know, we do have, you know, just incredible rates of disease in our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Like this one?PERINO: Well, I think he's obviously free to express his opinion; and people might seek it out, because he's a major superstar and he's in incredible health. And so people might want to know what would you feed your kids?I just think that he didn't have to actually name Coca-Cola. You could have said, say, ""soft drinks,"" and that would have been a more reasonable thing to do.BOLLING: Yes. He can cross off Coca-Cola and General Mills, I guess, whoever the brand that he named -- he can cross those off as potential endorsements.WILLIAMS: You sure that wasn't Mayor Bloomberg?BOLLING: K.G.GUILFOYLE: You know, I mean, this is the influence of Gisele.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Brazilian, healthy, eating acai berries, all of that. Yes, and so let him -- he can say what he wants. It's not like it's going to hit him in the pocketbook.GUTFELD: I think that he should shut up. And I'll tell you why. Coca-Cola is the greatest beverage ever made. It used to have cocaine in it back in the day.By anyway, Coke -- I had Coca-Cola every day when I was a child, and I turned out like this. By the way...PERINO: Did it stunt your growth?GUTFELD: Yes, it did. How dare you?But I've got to say this: Coca-Cola doesn't cause head injuries. It doesn't cause head injuries. What does? Something called football, Mr. Brady.BOLLING: Speaking of football, don't forget this weekend Brady gets a little revenge served on a platter, perhaps.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, big headlines from the campaign trail as a brawl breaks out at one rally. Reports bubble up of Republicans getting out and the two clear front-runners in the GOP race for the White House band together and threaten to boycott the next big debate.Welcome to ""The Kelly File"" everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly.Donald Trump and Ben Carson laying down a set of demands in the joint letter to the network hosting the next republican debate. Mr. Trump and Dr. Carson tells CNBC that if it does not change the debate format, then the two men will not participate. The letter reads, quote, ""Neither of our campaigns agreed to either the length you proposed or your ban on opening and closing statements. In fact, neither of our campaigns were even consulted. Neither of those conditions are acceptable.""Reportedly, the campaigns of Senators Rand Paul, and Ted Cruz, and Governor Jeb Bush are also calling for changes. But so far, tonight, one republican candidate is not ahead.We will be joined live by presidential candidate Carly Fiorina whose campaign today suggested that her opponents, lack of, quote, endurance for the three hour debate speaks volumes.But first up tonight, Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News digital politics editor. And Marc Thiessen, Fox News contributor and former chief speechwriter to President George W. Bush.All right. Chris, let me start with you. So many of these candidates, but, in particular, Carson and Trump are very ticked off.  About what, exactly?CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, it's too long. And if you watch the dug on CNN debate, it went on, three hours of a debate. And, by the end, Trump was kind of sleepy. And his -- he was a little lower energy. And it was -- I was sleepy by the third hour.KELLY: Me too.STIREWALT: So, I don't really blame any of the candidates. That's a long time to try to do it.KELLY: Exactly. We were thinking, thank God we didn't make the Fox News debate three hours.STIREWALT: Of course. But if you have, one could drew candidates who were packed on the stage, you want to ask everybody questions, so they want to make it longer, these guys want to make it shorter. And if you're Trump and if you're Carson, you don't want the debate, you don't need the debate.  You're at top of the polls. You're not great at debates --KELLY: Ahah!STIREWALT: -- maybe you're happy if you have to object.KELLY: Well, that's the question, Marc. Is it any accident that those two are saying we don't want that. And Fiorina is saying, why not?MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, who's the good debater of those three? I mean, look, Trump and Carson both have had pretty bad debates in the first two outings. So, no surprises, they don't want to.  And look at what Donald Trump's objections are. One, it's too long. Two, I can't waste time with opening and closing statements. I mean, in other words, he's basically saying, there's too much time to actually, you know, debate. So he doesn't want to debate. And so, you know, I would be much more impressed if his objection was, look, it's time to window the field a little bit. We have too many candidates -- there's not enough time for us to have a good exchange. That would be a legitimate objection. But he doesn't want to have time for an exchange. Because he doesn't want to have more time for Carly Fiorina to fillet him on foreign policy the way she did in the last one.KELLY: What is going to happen if neither Dr. Carson nor Donald Trump shows up at this debate, Chris?STIREWALT: They'll find a waif to accommodate.KELLY: CNBC will?STIREWALT: I would imagine they will find some way. But why they had to do this in public, so doing it publicly is what tells me that both Trump and Carson would be more than okay with getting out of these debates.  Remember, the Republican Party changed the regime for debates this cycle in order to try to protect a Faberge egg fragile frontrunner of the Romnesian kind.KELLY: Okay.STIREWALT: But now they find that the frontrunner is somebody who needs debate and who if he were subjected to more debates, would be falling down and the republican establishment would like that.KELLY: All right. I've got the move onto this. Because now there are reports today that Ben Carson, who is the frontrunner, according to some polls, and tied for first in others, is getting out of the race all together. The Carson campaign tonight is furious over an ABC report today that he was putting his campaign event on hold to promote his book. And he's just come out with a statement on Facebook calling this irresponsible and very wrong reporting saying, nothing is on hold.Chris, what do you make of it?STIREWALT: Well, this is trying to treat Ben Carson like a non- legitimate candidate. Like he is not for real. And so here you have I believe it was ABC News that had the initial report.KELLY: Yes.STIREWALT: That they come out and say, well, this guy is just a joke.  He is suspending his campaign for a book tour. When it's clear as you read what Carson says, what his campaign says, I talked to an unpaid advisor to the campaign, and you thought everybody, here's what happened, they were making it very clear. There will be no co-mingling of the book tour and for political, for legal reasons, you can't co-mingle the stuff. And they were just trying to make it clear that there's going to be no hanky panky.  They're not going to be having book advance paid for by the campaign or campaign events paid for by the book tour.KELLY: Uh-hm.STIREWALT: And they were trying to make that clear. And boom, you get a story that says, Carson is dropping out. Why would the guy who was tied for first drop out?KELLY: I know. Well, ABC News didn't report that he's dropping out but that's been the media speculation today in the wake of the report that he's putting his winning campaign thus far on hold for two weeks to promote his book. If he was then, why on earth would you do that? And the hence speculation tonight Carson says, nonsense. But there are other reports about Rand Paul possibly getting out of the race. And they led to somebody who was doing this live streaming event yesterday. Where cameras followed him all through Iowa. And he just took everybody through his entire day.  And he got to answer some questions that were being offered to him. And here, we apologize in advance for some of the language. But here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KAN., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The third question, most popular question, from Google is Rand Paul still running for president and I don't know, we wouldn't be doing this damn ass live streaming if I weren't. So, yes, I still am running for president. Get over it.Where is Rand Paul in the poll? This is not live. We can't edit this, right?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Right. But it's available. Marc, Rand Paul. Likely to get out?THIESSEN: Yep. We better have opening statements in the debate so he can stand there and say, who am I? Why am I here? Because that's what he's basically saying. I mean, first of all, it's pretty bad when you have to stand in front of the American people in the live stream and say people are asking. Are you still running? I mean, that's not a sign of success.  You know? And this is a guy who, unfortunately, the rationale of his campaign has disappeared with the rise of ISIS and the return of the Taliban in Afghanistan. Nobody is looking for an isolationist libertarian.KELLY: He doesn't like live stream. And doesn't find an intelligent way of communicating his message. Great to see you.THIESSEN: Thanks, Megyn.STIREWALT: You bet.THIESSEN: Well, Carly Fiorina is taking shots at both Donald Trump and Ben Carson for threatening to boycott this debate. The republican presidential candidate is here next to explain why. And then, President Obama has said repeatedly that the war in Afghanistan is over. We're out.  Everyone is coming home. Until he said something very different today.  Colonel Tony Shaffer served two tours there, and he'll tell us what's really behind this news.Plus, in the 2014 election cycle, the Democrats produced over 50,000 ads attacking two private citizens. And tonight, one of them joins yours truly in an incredibly rare television interview. Charles Koch, just ahead.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Do you believe that the Democrats including the President have tried to make bogeymen out of you and your brother, David?(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, the only republican woman running for president shows today she's not afraid to throw a few sharp elbows. After the two republican front-runners wrote an open letter complaining about among other things. The long amount of time planned for the next GOP debate, as we just discussed. Carly Fiorina's deputy campaign manager throws a virtual grenade at three big GOP competitors. In just one tweet, writing, ""Seems Jeb Bush isn't the only low-energy guy. Looks like Donald Trump and Carson don't have endurance to debate Carly Fiorina for three hours.""Joining me now, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard and republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina. Great to see you tonight, Carly.  So, what's your take on these gentlemen's objections to the length of the CNBC debate?CARLY FIORINA, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I think apparently they're worried about answering questions for three hours. For heaven sakes, we have ten candidates on the stage. I don't think three hours is a long time. And I think the American people actually like these debates.  Maybe the establishments wants fewer debates. But I think the American people really like them. And I think we ought to stand and answer as many questions as we can. They also apparently ask for prepared statements.  You know, prepared statements are what politicians do. So, honestly, here are two outsiders supposedly. Donald Trump and Ben Carson they sound a lot like politicians tonight to me.KELLY: In their defense, don't you think that CNN debate was a little long, three hours -- don't you get tired at all by the end?FIORINA: Well, yes, three hours is a long time. But when you have 11 people on the stage, this time we'll have 10. And when there are so many issues facing the American people, I think it's actually quite important.  You know, the CNN democrat debate was two hours. On the other hand, they only had five people on the stage.  KELLY: That long too. Let me ask you about the CNN democratic debate because we didn't --(LAUGHTER)I haven't heard your take on it, yet. But I saw in a written statement that you put out. You said, it's going to be a different thing if Hillary Clinton has to go up against you. And you wrote, she won't get away with, quote, ""downright lying."" What specifically did you hear that you thought was a downright lie in her part?FIORINA: You know, it's what I've been hearing for months and months.  It wasn't even specific to Tuesday night. Unfortunately Bernie Sanders gave her a big pass by saying, the American people are tired of hearing about your emails and your server. But of course, she lied about both.  She lied about Benghazi, I mean, honestly, when she knew the night of that terrorist attack that it was a purposeful terrorists attack, pre-planned in fact. She, nevertheless, faced the nation the next morning and talked about a video that didn't represent the values of the American people.Instead of saying, this was a purposeful, pre-planned terrorist attack and we will see a retribution. But I also found it kind of amusing honestly that Hillary claimed she was an outsider because she was a woman.  No, she's not an outsider. She is the quintessential professional member of the political class. But I think what we can expect her to do is play that gender card over and over and over.KELLY: Now, speaking of women and gender, some of them critical of you. And I confess that I made comments about this myself earlier this week. About whether you need to be warmer in order to connect better with the voters. And I said publicly at the Fortune's Most Powerful Women's Conference. I checked myself on that saying, is this sexist? Am I saying -- and I tell you, I would that I think any political candidate needs to connect with an audience.And we did a long bio on you when you launched your campaign. You have, you know, a wonderful family story and lots a love in your life and so on. Do you think that is a fair criticism? That perhaps you could do a better job of connecting on a personal level with viewers and voters?FIORINA: Well, you know, in that debate, Megyn, the vast majority of viewers thought I won it. So I clearly connected. And I'm here in Iowa.  And I just spent the last hour answering questions from voters. And they clearly understood I was connecting. I tell personal stories every day.KELLY: Uh-hm.FIORINA: Because of course, we have to connect in an authentic way with voters. But I think you're wrong when I say I'm not connecting with voters. I think that's why my candidacy is rising. I also think this.  There is a time to smile. And there is a time to be serious. And when you're talking about ISIS, it's hard to smile.KELLY: Certainly not those moments. Certainly not those moments.FIORINA: When you're talking about the death of your -- when you're talking about the death of your daughter, it's not a time to smile.KELLY: Of course.FIORINA: When you're talking about late term abortions in order to harvest body parts, it's not time to smile.  KELLY: But those are strawman --(CROSSTALK)KELLY: No one suggesting that in those moments, you should be laughing. And I didn't suggest you're not connecting with voters --FIORINA: But those were the questions that were getting asked. Those are the questions that were getting asked.KELLY: Here's why the reason I asked. So, this is a picture of you with your daughters, you know, in the bathtub which is great. And you see this mother and you see the love. And you know, a lot of us have seen this side of you. But we've also seen is you're slipping in the polls even though you skyrocketed after the CNN debate. You were way the heck up there. You know, number two in some polls. Now you're back down. We have a chart that shows, to where you were before even the FOX debate. And so folks have been asking why? Why is that? Why do you think it is?FIORINA: Well, actually, I don't agree with the premise of your question. I'm number two in New Hampshire today, I'm number three in Iowa.  I'm number two in Nevada. I'm way up there in South Carolina.KELLY: On the national polls, you're not.FIORINA: In the places where primaries are going to happen. Well, there's lots of problems with national polls.KELLY: In the Fox News poll, you're six.FIORINA: You and I have discussed, there's lots of problems with FOX News polls, frankly. That's something that we discussed many times. The national polls. People are going to go up and down. What I think is important to understand is in the state polls where the primaries are going to be held. I am a clear front-runner. And it's also true that we still have about 40 percent of the American voters, republican primary voters, who say they don't know anything about me. That's in the FOX News poll.KELLY: Uh-hm.FIORINA: So, I'm actually very happy with where I am. I think we are connecting with voters. And I think we're going to continue to rise in the polls. As more and more Americans get to know who I am and what my story is. And what I will do most importantly as president of the United States.KELLY: We'll post that, people who haven't seen it, we'll post that bio package that we did on you on our Facebook page at Facebook.com/kellyfile so folks can see a bit about your background. And we appreciate you coming on. Thank you. All the best.FIORINA: That would be fantastic, thank you.KELLY: All right. Take care.FIORINA: Thanks, Megyn.  KELLY: Well, also new tonight, a new fallout from 180 degree change in course, from a president dealing with the series of foreign policy headaches. President Obama today declaring that the U.S. drawdown of troops in Afghanistan will not happen the way he promised so many times.  There are 9800 troops currently stationed there. The original plan was to cut that in half by the end of 2016 at which point, just a thousand would remain he said to protect our embassy. He's at embassy level. It's a plan that we've been hearing about for years. And what he said would not change. Period.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Afghan forces now in the lead for their own security. Our troops have moved to a support role. Together with our allies, we will complete our mission there by the end of this year and America's longest war will finally be over. Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over.The date for us to have completed our draw down will not change.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: But, today, it did change. A lot. As the commander-in-chief announces that all of those troops he promised would be coming home would likely have to stay.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: I've decided to maintain our current posture of 9800 troops in Afghanistan through most of next year, 2016. But maintaining our current posture through most of next year rather than a more rapid drawdown will allow us to sustain our efforts.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Colonel Anthony Shaffer is a retired CIA trained Intel Operative who served two tours in Afghanistan which he recounted in his best-selling book, ""Operation Dark Heart: Spycraft and Special Ops on the Frontlines of Afghanistan and the Path to Victory.""Colonel, good to see you tonight. And this is an admission by President Obama, an admission of what?LT. COL. TONY SHAFFER (RET), CIA TRAINED INTEL OPERATIVE: An admission that he's abandoning the plan to abandon Afghanistan. I mean, let's be clear here. The basic reality, what she faces, is one where the Taliban, as much as he does not like them get a vote in the current circumstances. And what's happening simply Megyn is that he recognizes that as much as he wants to walk away, he cannot. The Taliban have been making huge gains. And if we don't stop them now, they will continue to gain ground. And ISIS more importantly, now is in 10 of the provinces in Afghanistan, about 36, seven of which they're in-charge of. So, to abandon the mission now, I think would be a kin to allowing Afghanistan to slip into the same, if not worst chaos, that Iraq is seen. And I think frankly, to be a bit political here, I think this is a mission that made the wrong decision regarding Iraq --  KELLY: What finally did it? Because the military -- reportedly has been telling him, your plan isn't going to work. You can't do it.SHAFFER: Right.KELLY: For a long time. I mean, he's been on camera saying the things we just played.SHAFFER: I think two things, first, General Campbell, the current commander there is doing a great job. He's doing what's necessary the right way at the right time. And also, we just saw a major change of command at the Pentagon. General Joseph Dunford, Joe Dunford just took over as the chairman. And he's made changes already. He dumped off the $500 million so-called Syrian, the moderate rebel training program which, you know, we trained five people, he dumped that already. And this is another change. And look, I've heard that the White House did not want this. The White House was fighting this tooth and nail. But Megyn, I think that the key here is that the reality we face is simply if we abandon Afghanistan the way we did Iraq, you will see chaos, you will see safe havens instantly pop up. And we will see if not, the same problems, worst problems with the idea of having Afghanistan the another safe haven for ISIS to grow rapidly.  KELLY: Last question.SHAFFER: Sure.KELLY: You served two terms there. You wrote about this in your book. Is this enough? Does he have the numbers right?SHAFFER: Yes, as a matter of fact, the numbers are correct. We, by putting a hundred thousand troops there --KELLY: This is you.SHAFFER: -- conventional troops, we're just in the way. This is a special operations where, always was. We're going back the way we were winning in 2003, 2004. We need to do one thing very well. Kill the bad guys and allow for the political process, the reconciliation between the Taliban and the Afghan government, primarily to happen. We need to oversee that, not force it. So our job now, simply, is to make sure that we kill the bad guys, when we find them, we maintain enough offensive operations to do it.KELLY: All right.SHAFFER: And then do what's necessary to protect the American people.  Period.KELLY: Colonel Tony Shaffer, great to see you, thank you, sir.SHAFFER: It's great. Thank you, ma'am.KELLY: Up next, a high school scuffle blows up into a brawl with police. The entire thing caught on camera and, Mark Eiglarsh is next on the legal complaints we are already hearing about excessive force.And then, Charles Koch took a fledgling oil company -- wasn't fledgling but it wasn't what it is today, and turn it into one of the biggest firms in America and became target number one for the Democrats in the process. Now, after years of largely ignoring attacks from the Left, he finally breaks his silence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Why do you think they've been so relentless in their attacks?  Harry Reid, your brother David pointed out, mentioned the Koch Brothers 289 times from the Senate floor. They have painted you as evil. They actually put you, the White House actually put you on an enemy's list back in the 2012 campaign.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Developing tonight, a new claim of excessive force against police. This time from a father in Texas planning to press charges now against the police officer who was called in to break up a fight at a local high school. That officer wound up grabbing the man's 14-year-old son by the neck, dropping the boy to the floor and the whole thing was caught on camera. Watch carefully.Joining me now, criminal defense attorney and former Prosecutor Mark Eiglarsh. Mark, good to see you. So, this cop --MARK EIGLARSH, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: I'm sorry, this father of this boy wants the cop charged criminally and says, this is an example of excessive force against a 14- year-old boy who had been in dust-up over goggles, sport goggles. And it wasn't like someone's got a gun, let's get the kid down.  EIGLARSH: Right.KELLY: Your thoughts.EIGLARSH: Well, first of all, as a father of three children, one of them being a teenager around that same age, I would be irate if a police officer did this to my son. However, if we're analyzing this objectively, I am 100 percent certain, beyond all doubt that I don't know exactly what happened. There's no audio tape.KELLY: Right.EIGLARSH: And if you believe what the officers are saying, this kid was determined to go back and continue the fight that he began with another teenager. So, these officers had to take some action.KELLY: But here's -- let's just look at the tape. Okay? Take Mark and me off and show the audience the fall screen. Now, watch. Forget this part. Let's just watch what happens in the beginning. The cops put his hands on the kid. The kid brushes it away. Watch. Right there. See, and then the cop takes him down. If you can just rerack it, you can see. So, the cop places his hand on the kid, you got to start it from the beginning.  And then the kid tries to knock the cop's arm away. That is when the cop steps in and takes him down. The police are going to argue that, again, we're not starting it at the right spot, right there, see? The police are going to argue that he was resisting arrest and that he was going to cause more mayhem. Would that do it? Would that justify what we've seen here?EIGLARSH: It's a fact sensitive decision made by jurors. This is in Texas. We've got to mention that. They're slightly conservative and slightly supportive of police officers like Bill O'Reilly is slightly opinionated. They will never, ever find in favor of this father and his son. This is law enforcement and they give wide latitude for them to take down somebody that they deem as a threat.KELLY: The kid was suspended for a couple of days for the fight he had. And the cop is under investigation although still on duty as the incident is under review. They say they repeatedly attempted to calm him and stop him from going after the other student and they were forced to detain him for his own safety and the safety of others. Great to see you, Mark.EIGLARSH: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: Well, when we got the incredibly rare chance to speak with Charles Koch, we of course had to ask about his political plans, attacks from the Left and how it feels to be publicly criticized by the President of the United States. But we also wanted to know how you build $110 billion company. Some amazing advice. Everyone needs to hear, next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Tell us about the first piece of advice your dad gave you when you took over as CEO.  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  KELLY: Charles Koch is the sixth richest man in the country. One of the most successful men in the world. Yet, his very name has almost become code for some on the left for what they believe is wrong with big money in politics.Fifty three thousand attack ads hit him in just the last election cycle. Personal attacked launched against him from the highest levels of government.Tonight, in a cable exclusive, we introduce you to the man few really know. We'll tackle the attacks, the myths, his politics and look at how Charles Koch became a tycoon of industry whose charitable works go largely unreported.Finally, we'll find out why he's willing to risk everything even his personal safety, to, in his words, make the country better for everyone.Charles Koch, captain of industry, innovator, and some say GOP king maker, which has made him a target of the democrats for years.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What is un-American is when shadowy billionaires pour unlimited money into our democracy to rig the system to benefit themselves and the wealthiest 1 percent.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They don't care what anybody says, except for themselves and the corporate masters like the Koch Brothers. They have one master and that's the money.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When people hear the name, Koch Brothers, it has a negative connotation.HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I will stand up to all the attacks from the supper PACs and the Koch Brothers every chance I get.KELLY: Even President Obama has joined in. Putting Charles and his brother David, who, together, employ nearly 60,000 Americans on a so-called enemies' list during campaign 2012.OBAMA: When you start seeing massive lobbying efforts backed by fossil fuel interests or conservative think tanks or the Koch Brothers, that's a problem.KELLY: The Koch Brothers seen they donate to republicans and they support fossil fuels, among other forms of energy. They own pipelines and lots of successful products you likely know very well.Koch grew up in Wichita, Kansas. The son of Fred Koch, who struck it rich in the energy business, and who, along with wife, Mary, raised four sons on the family ranch. Charles married wife Liz four decades ago, they've raised two children and appear devoted to one another.Charles eventually took over his father's business and grew it into the second largest private firm in America. The company, worth $21 million in 1961, is now worth $100 billion.Charles and David have donated hundreds of millions to help fight cancer, poverty and to encourage entrepreneurship in addition to their political donations.So, how exactly did Charles Koch, a man demonized by the President, the former Senate Majority Leader, and the House Minority Leader, to name a few, become so feared and so successful.For the first time, he tells us from his home in Wichita, banked up a little, thanks to foot surgery and wearing a cast decorated by his wife, ready to talk about life, politics and his new book, ""Good Profit.""So, your book, ""Good Profit,"" reads to me like a love letter to your father. How big of an influence was he on you?CHARLES KOCH, KOCH INDUSTRIES CO-OWNER & CEO: Both my parents were tremendous influence for me. And my father's influence came from -- he decided, well, probably before we were born that as he put it, I'm not going to have any kids who are country club bums.KELLY: He worked you.KOCH: He wanted to instill the work ethic. And, because he knew if you don't learn to work to be more productive to improve your efficiency, to cooperate with other people at an early age, you may never learn those habits.So, you can't make a contribution, you can't be successful. Then, years later, when I asked my father, I said, pop, why were you so much harder on me than my younger brothers? He said, son, you plum wore me out.KELLY: Later, Koch kept up the hard work landing at the prestigious MIT. His plan was not to take over the family business.KOCH: My father, going back at working for him, he was such a disciplinarian growing up, I had no idea I would do that.KELLY: But things changed.KOCH: He called me. He said, son, my health is not good. I don't have that long to live. Either you come back to run the company or I'm going to have to sell it.KELLY: Tell us about the first piece of advice that you dad gave you when you took over as CEO.KOCH: His first word when I arrived is, son, I hope your first deal is a loser, otherwise, you'll think you're a lot smarter than you are. But he had tremendous values, tremendous integrity, humility, work ethic and terrific thirst for knowledge.KELLY: You warn in the book about the trap of overconfidence, in a business and a person?KOCH: Oh, absolutely. Yes. Hubris arrogance is just one step ahead of loss of integrity. Because if you think you're better than other people, you know more than you're going to think, as many leaders have, that the rules don't apply to them. So, they lose their integrity.KELLY: His new book, ""Good Profit,"" emphasizes integrity. Arguing it's fine to make lots of money. But how you do it matters.You say you've always prized values over talent in your hiring decision. Really?KOCH: Absolutely. I've had the philosophy that John Adams expressed in the kind of system they were trying to create in this country, that this is a system for moral people. It will work for no other.KELLY: You're telling me some hot shot salesman from New York who come down, top of his game, and, you know, I'm sure, he may bend the rules here or there, but he's a producer. You won't hire that guy?KOCH: No, absolutely not. This is going to bend the rules, we won't have it. And in our interview process, that's what we look for.KELLY: How do you figure out someone's value, their integrity, in a job interview?KOCH: We put the candidate in different situations. Like we have somebody that the candidate doesn't think important, we take him down to the cafeteria, we see how the candidate treats that person, how they the staff at the cafeteria. And we see how they answer questions.We ask them, gosh, did you have any problems where you work? Did you make any mistakes? If they say, no, oh, no, but the company was so screwed up and they wouldn't listen to me. We don't want that person.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: What is the inability to admit mistakes tell you about somebody?KOCH: They don't have any humility and probably don't have any integrity.KELLY: Humility in hiring also served Koch well.Don't you want all the hot shot MBA's from Harvard and Wharton and elsewhere?KOCH: We find we do better from community colleges, from rural colleges, like after I was president of Koch Industries, our next president were -- well, one didn't graduate from college. And the current president is from Emporia State.KELLY: At Koch Industries, even you get evaluated. Is that true?KOCH: That's true.KELLY: How does that work?KOCH: That works great. I learn a lot.KELLY: Aren't you afraid of a bruised ego?KOCH: No. Like here's the thing. And that I think all of us need this attitude. Do you want to have your feelings hurt a little bit because you've got some negative feedback. Or do you want to continue down the disastrous track you're on and have a huge disaster? Talk about a bruised ego. It may ruin your career.KELLY: Is it true that any employee at Koch can earn more than his boss?KOCH: Oh, absolutely. It's -- we try to reward people according to the value they create. Value they create in society and the value they create for the company.KELLY: And that you will hire based on talent? Even if you don't have an open spot, necessarily?KOCH: well, on values, yes.KELLY: How can you hold to a budget under those circumstances?KOCH: Well, we're not big on budgets.KELLY: The other message you want to send your employees in your book is try new things. Experiment and don't be afraid to fail or make mistakes.KOCH: Right. If you never failed, then you're probably not doing very much. You're certainly not innovating. You're not improving. Because the only way you improve is to try new things.KELLY: What if you're a big success and you don't want to risk it?KOCH: That's one of my principles. Success is one of the worst enemies of success. Because success tends to breed complacency and lack of humility.KELLY: When companies aren't successful, Koch says Uncle Sam should stay out of it, dismissing government subsidies, loans and tariffs as, quote, ""Corporate welfare.""KOCH: Well, ""Corporate welfare,"" I think, is a disaster for this country. It's crippling our economy. It's contributing to a permanent underclass and corrupting the business community.KELLY: Critics say what the Koch's really oppose is government assistance that could hurt Koch's bottom line. A charge Koch denies.KOCH: We oppose all corporate welfare, whether we benefit or not. You will find that our policy positions mainly hurt our profitability rather than help it.KELLY: What about China? We've heard one of the presidential candidates, Donald Trump talk repeatedly about how they are devaluing their currency and that the next president needs to put a stop to that by, perhaps imposing a tariff on their goods.KOCH: Well, I mean, tariffs are a disaster. The way -- the principle way that human beings had gotten out of extreme poverty is free trade.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: When we return, Charles Koch addresses the attack from the left, the death threats and why he is still working so hard at the age of 79. Don't go away.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Not long ago, President Obama himself came out and attacked you. It's not the first time, but he said that the Koch Brothers are trying to prevent new clean energy businesses from succeeding.You came out, and, in a rare public statement, said you were flabbergasted by that accusation. Why?(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: The Koch's are behind a number of political action groups which have been demonized by the left. Donors may remain anonymous under the law, a source for consternation for Koch's critics including President Obama.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Not long ago, President Obama himself came out and attacked you. It's not the first time, but he said that the Koch Brothers are trying to prevent new clean energy businesses from succeeding.You came out, and, in a rare public statement, said you were flabbergasted by that accusation. Why?KOCH: Because the opposite is true. All of our policies are based on whether it will make -- enable people to improve their lives or it will make their lives worse.KELLY: On the comments made by President Obama beneath the dignity of the office?KOCH: Well, I think it is to misrepresent what a company stands for and attacking private citizens for trying to help people improve their lives.KELLY: Do you believe that the democrats, including the President have tried to make bogeymen out of you and your brother David?KOCH: Oh, definitely. That's a full time job on their part. I mean -- and that's why I've never been that fond of politics and only got into it recently kicking and screaming. Because I don't think politicians are going to reverse the trajectory of this country.I think it's going to depend on the American people understanding what is fair and what makes our lives better.KELLY: Why do you think they've been so relentless in their attacks? Harry Reid, your brother David pointed out, mentioned the Koch Brothers 289 times from the Senate floor.They have painted you as evil. They actually put you -- the White House actually put you on an enemy's list back in the 2012 campaign.KOCH: Well, I mean that's very sad that -- that's what where -- what we've come to. Because in fact, what we're trying to do is the opposite.KELLY: Is it dangerous? I know you've gotten death threats.KOCH: Yes. I get a lot of death threats but the way I look at it is, I feel I have a moral obligation to do the best I can to make the country better for everybody. And that threatens certain people because they're going to have much less power. I want the power to go back to people making decisions over their own lives rather than some experts making it.KELLY: Are you a libertarian?KOCH: No. I'm a -- I have been a libertarian in my past but now I consider myself a classical liberal.KELLY: Classical liberal. What does that mean?KOCH: Classical liberal is someone who wants a society that maximizes peace, civility, tolerance and well-being for everyone. One that opens opportunities for everyone to advance themselves.KELLY: Koch didn't want to reveal his opinions on individual candidates. But we tried. So the ""L"" word will have people asking is he going to vote for Hillary Clinton.KOCH: Well, I mean, putting aside all the things that are said about Hillary today, my main difference with her is on the vision of what kind of society will make people's lives better.So, this is a vision of society in which people are too evil or stupid to run their own lives, but those in power are perfectly capable of running everybody else's lives because they're so much smarter.It's what I call the fatal conceit or William Easterly called the ""Tyranny of experts"" because that's what it is, its tyranny.KELLY: This discussion will now have people thinking, ah-ha, he likes Rand Paul. He has libertarian leanings. He wants government out of our lives. Is Rand your guy?KOCH: No, I don't have a guy. I have these principles and what I'm trying to accomplish, and what we need, to me, is a candidate that will help change the trajectory of the country from all this wasteful, irresponsible spending that's heading us for a financial cliff, not just by the democrats but by the republicans.The reason we tend to support republicans is they're taking us toward the cliff at only 70 miles an hour and the democrats are taking us 100 miles an hour.KELLY: They say you're going to spend $900 million on the presidential race this cycle. Is that true?KOCH: No, not even close.KELLY: Koch says it's actually more like $300 million, and not all will go to a presidential race. As for the democrats' charge that Koch's donor network is shady.KOCH: Everything I give is pretty much as public. Now not every donor wants to -- or is willing to get the kind of abuse and attacks that we do, or death threats, so they're not willing to have their names out. And I think the other side is pushing for that because they want to intimidate people so they won't oppose it.KELLY: But Charles Koch is not intimidated. And not slowing down any time soon. At 79 years old, you still work nine hours a day.(CROSSTALK)KOCH: Well, more than that.KELLY: You come home and have dinner with Liz. And then you work again.KOCH: Well, OK. Now do you find it hard?KELLY: Find it there, we got there.KOCH: Sorry, thank you so much.KELLY: Why? Why do you still work so hard?KOCH: Because I feel a passion for what we're trying to do. I mean, why does somebody who's old as a writer keep writing? Because that's who they are. That's their nature. And to be happy you have to fulfill your nature.That's what Aristotle taught so many centuries ago, that the road to happiness isn't to go drink more or consume more. The road to happiness is fully develop your abilities, and then apply them to do good.KELLY: And speaking of happiness, Koch's father left his sons a bit of money upon his death. Along with one final piece of advice.KOCH: If you choose to let this money destroy your initiative and independence, then it will be a curse to you and my action in giving it to you will have been a mistake.I shall regret very much to have you miss the glorious feeling of accomplishment. Remember, that often adversity is a blessing in disguise and is certainly the greatest character builder. That's tough.KELLY: The glorious feeling of accomplishment.KOCH: Yes.KELLY: Charles Koch, thank you.KOCH: Well, thank you, Megyn. I appreciate it.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Getting lots of feedback online with Charles Koch, like this one, quote, ""Such a disappointing lack of evilness!
