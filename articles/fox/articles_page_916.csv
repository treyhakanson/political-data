This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.PAUL GIGOT, HOST: Welcome to the ""Journal Editorial Report."" I'm Paul Gigot.Issues of national security dominating the presidential campaign this week as the nation commemorates the 15th anniversary of the September 11th attacks. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump participated in a commander-in-chief forum Wednesday night before an audience of veterans and active-duty military personnel. And both candidates raised some eyebrows with their answers, with Donald Trump doubling down on his praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Hillary Clinton promising not to put ground troops in Syria and Iraq.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If he says great things about me I'm going to say great things about him me. I've already said he is very much of a leader. You can say isn't that a terrible thing? And the man has a very strong control over a country. Now it's a very different season and I don't know to like the system but certainly in that system he's been a leader. Far more than our president has been a leader.HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They are not going to get ground troops. We are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again. And we're not putting ground troops into Syria. We're going to defeat ISIS without committing American ground troops.(END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT: Joining the panel this week Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; columnists, Mary Anastasia O'Grady and Bill McGurn; and Mary Kissel, host of Opinion Journal on ""WSJ Live.""Dan, it seems to me the core argument that Hillary Clinton is trying to make here is that Donald Trump is unfit to be commander-in-chief, leading military forces, making life-and-death decisions. How did Trump meet that challenge?DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Well, I thought he did pretty well, by and large, in that confrontation with her and Matt Lauer, though he has this propensity to shoot himself in the foot. And if that doesn't work, he shoots himself in the other foot with remarks like Putin has 82 percent approval rating --(LAUGHTER)-- and Russia making -- you wonder what's the other 18 percent or even where they are -- and seizing the oil. I mean, we didn't seize the oil.  We're not going to seize the oil. Why keep bringing it up?That said, Paul, the fact is that in the CNN poll, Hillary Clinton's rating for commander-in-chief, people who want her to be commander-in-chief, is 50 percent. In The Washington Post, it's 46 percent. Why isn't a person who has been secretary of state for four years, a U.S. Senator, the most famous public woman in the world, getting more support than that to become commander-in-chief? Hillary Clinton has some sort of difficult ceiling that has fallen over her on these issues. I think there's room for Donald Trump to grow if he will stop shooting himself in the foot.GIGOT: Mary?MARY ANASTASIA O'GRADY, COLUMNIST: I think Dan hits on the right point, but just to go a little bit further with it, the problem for Donald Trump is not that Hillary Clinton would be a disaster as commander-in-chief, but that he doesn't take advantage of the fact that the real problem in Iraq is that the Obama administration gave Iraq back after we had done the surge and we had a victory. And once they gave Iraq back, the whole thing fell apart. What does Trump do instead? He talks about we should never go to walk, which, A, is not true and, B, is not a very strong argument for national security.GIGOT: There's a real debate whether or not he was opposed to the war at the start.O'GRADY: He came out and said, yeah, that he was mildly in favor of going?GIGOT: Bill, this Putin bromance by Trump, you know, Putin is somebody who is working against American interests in Europe and he's working against American interests in the Middle East.BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST: Right.GIGOT: Why would you say such favorable things about this authoritarian?  I don't get it.MCGURN: Very simple reason, Paul, he's not Irish. If you're Irish --(LAUGHTER)-- you recognize enemy. ""My enemy can also be my enemy.""(LAUGHTER)And it's amazing, given, you know, his stand on Iran because Syria is crucial to Iran and so forth. He just seems to have a binary track that, because the Russians might kill some ISIS leaders, then they're on our side. We ignore Ukraine. Ignore Europe. We ignore the rest of the Syrian problem. So it's just -- I think it's a binary track.GIGOT: He's playing into Hillary Clinton's hands with this, Mary.MARY KISSEL, HOST, OPINION JOURNAL ON WSJ LIVE: He certainly is. He certainly is. It's a shame because there's so much about Hillary Clinton's record that you could critique. You could look, for example, her support of the Iran deal. You could look at the reset with Putin in Russia that went so wrong. You can look at her handling of Libya. You can look at Chinese aggression in the South China Sea and what she said about that.  And as Mary said, he just misses all of these opportunities.GIGOT: On that Russia point, Hillary Clinton and a lot of Democrats, including President Obama, are now suddenly very hawkish about Vladimir Putin. That wasn't the case for six or seven years. And Hillary Clinton was the architect of the reset. Suddenly, she thinks it's back to the Cold War here. And some of that might be artificial?O'GRADY: Right now, these two candidates are fighting for Independent and undecided voters. I think most of those voters are not expecting some kind of mapped-out plan about how they're going to, you know, defeat Vladimir Putin. But they want instincts. They want the right gut reaction. In the case of Russia, both Mrs. Clinton and Trump have treated the human rights violations inside the country as something that's totally unimportant.  That is not what the United States -- tradition of the United States has been since the Cold War.GIGOT: Dan, what do you make of the ground troop assertion by Mrs. Clinton? No ground troops ever in Syria and Iraq.HENNINGER: Yeah. I'll tell you what I make of that, Paul. What I make of that is that Hillary Clinton does not believe that, but Hillary Clinton said that because that's what her party wants her to say. This is not the party of Bill Clinton or the party of Harry Truman. It is now the Democratic party of Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi. And they do not want to commit the military anywhere in the world because that would require increases in military spending, which Donald Trump is proposing. Hillary Clinton is constrained by her party.  We have to keep that in mind that it isn't just this one person. It's an entire Democratic Party mindset that will govern her national security policy. That is not true on the Republican side with Donald Trump.GIGOT: Briefly, Bill, by the way, there are troops, ground troops --(CROSSTALK)MCGURN: There are troops in Syria and Iraq.(LAUGHTER)And Americans don't realize what we have. Dan is absolutely right. The only thing the party cares about is her vote authorizing force in Iraq.  They don't care -- the worst vote was her opposition to the surge.GIGOT: To the surge.MCGURN: And so forth, which was political. But that party doesn't want us involved anywhere. And that's what she's going to be constrained by is she's elected president.GIGOT: She may regret that because she may have to deploy ground troops to defeat ISIS.MCGURN: Right.GIGOT: All right.Up next, the race for the White House continues to tighten with a new batch of polls showing Donald Trump closing in on Hillary Clinton nationally and even in key battleground states. Pollster Doug Schoen breaks it down, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT: More evidence this week that the race for president is tightening, with the latest RealClearPolitics polling average giving Hillary Clinton a narrow 2.7 point lead over Donald Trump, down from 4.5 points last week.  And in a four-way race, with Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party Candidate Jill Stein, that lead shrinks further to 2.1 point. Trump is chipping away at Clinton's lead in some battleground states as well with a new batch of Quinnipiac polls showing the race neck and neck in Florida, North Carolina, and Ohio.Doug Schoen is a Democratic pollster and former adviser to President Bill Clinton.Welcome back.DOUG SCHOEN, POLLSTER & FORMER PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER TO BILL CLINTON:  Thanks, Paul.GIGOT: When you were last here, I gave you a hard time because the brace had widened with Clinton and you had said this is a really a pick-'em race.  Now it's back to where you said, so I congratulations.SCHOEN: Thank you.GIGOT: Now, why is it tightening again?SCHOEN: A couple of reasons. First, the convention bounce that Secretary Clinton had has largely eroded. Second, the continuing e-mail scandal she has shown no signs of abating with the release of the FBI notes and additional emails. And third, Paul, I don't think fundamentally the American people or a majority of them want to elect Secretary Clinton. And they have two choices they have doubts about, Secretary Clinton and Donald Trump.GIGOT: What are the doubts about Clinton? Is it the fact they're reluctant to vote for somebody in the public eye for 25 years and been so controversial and they want to move on to something new? Is it that basic?SCHOEN: It is that basic. And there's one other thing. There is a lack of trust and credibility in the secretary of state, with negative ratings in those areas, around 60, sometimes as high as 65 percent. It's very hard, not impossible, I underscore, but very hard to get elected president when a majority, a substantial majority of the American people don't really think that you can be trusted to be honest and credible.GIGOT: The flip side of that, OK, as I look at the polls here, head to head, it looks like her support has fallen.SCHOEN: It has.GIGOT: OK. But Trump's has not necessarily risen. So that's why they're now more or less even.SCHOEN: Right.GIGOT: So what does Trump have -- first of all, do you agree with that analysis?SCHOEN: I do very much agree with that.GIGOT: What has to happen for us to break out of that tie?SCHOEN: People have different doubts about Trump. They wonder about his temperament. They wonder about his qualifications and his positions in some of the issues that we've been talking about, both you and I, on your panel earlier, about Russian and Putin, and foreign policy. The question is, is Donald Trump up to the job, which is why the first debate, I think, is so important. What I took away from the town hall with Matt Lauer was that Trump is in the hunt, is credible, but he's by no means closed the sale, Paul.GIGOT: So is Trump now getting the support of enough Republicans to win?  I mean, my sense is he's got to get above 90 percent or so and he was down in the low to mid 70s before.SCHOEN: He's gotten in the low to mid 80s now. So it's going in the right direction. The problem he has is getting the rest of the Republicans back so that the 90 percent number is hit, and then expanding his constituency with women and minorities to get at least a traditional Republican vote, because right now he's polling below norm in those two or three groups.GIGOT: I talked to a Republican this week who said that, as he was following a race in August in Pennsylvania, for example, a state that Donald Trump says he can win and hopes to win.SCHOEN: And needs to win.GIGOT: OK. Needs to win. All right. But he said that if you looked at what happened in the Philadelphia suburbs, not the core of Philly, but in the suburbs where there are a lot of Republicans, Trump, the bottom fell out of his support in August. Who are those voters and what does he need to do to get them back?SCHOEN: They are suburban, educated, moderate conservatives, certainly not extreme conservatives --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: College educated?SCHOEN: Absolutely, college educated, and people who see themselves as refined, civilized people who don't like the Clintons. They're not Democrats. But they pride themselves on their independence and their rationality. And much about the Trump message and presentation so far has been off putting.GIGOT: The Judge Curiel attacks, the Khan attack, that would have rubbed them very much the wrong way.SCHOEN: Absolutely, the wrong way. What they do respond to is a message of change because they don't like President Obama, they don't like Secretary Clinton. They want alternative politics and policies. So far, Trump has begun but hasn't quite developed a coherent narrative.GIGOT:  We also have two third-party candidates.SCHOEN: We do.GIGOT: Particularly, Gary Johnson, a Libertarian. I see him in the polls seven percent to 12 percent.SCHOEN: Correct.GIGOT: That's higher than a Libertarian has looked in a long time in a presidential race. And Jill Stein, 3 percent or 4 percent. How do you explain their staying power and would you anticipate that that goes down over time?SCHOEN: Sure. I think their staying power is a reflection of rejection of Trump and Clinton.GIGOT: It's about those two?SCHOEN: It's about those two.One interesting thing with Gary Johnson, his voters on the down-ballot votes are about 2-1 Republican, but yet they are people who heretofore look like they're inclined towards Secretary Clinton in a two-way race than Donald Trump. So who they are and how they vote is going to be a key question going forward.GIGOT: Why would they be Republicans and then be more inclined to vote for Mrs. Clinton? It's just --(CROSSTALK)SCHOEN: Disaffection from Donald Trump.GIGOT: With Trump. So is it better for Trump or Clinton to have Johnson in the debates?SCHOEN: I think it is probably better for Clinton to have him -- Johnson and Stein -- Stein won't be in, but Johnson -- to just deflect from the one-on-one confrontation. But so far, I think the Aleppo comment, not knowing where it was, that will freeze his vote.GIGOT: All right. Thank you, Doug Schoen, for being here.SCHOEN: Thank you, Paul.GIGOT: We appreciate it.When we come back, with scandals continuing to dog Hillary Clinton, her campaign turns the tables on Donald Trump, accusing the GOP nominee of some Pay-to-Play of his own.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT: I got tickled the other day when Mr. Trump called my foundation a criminal enterprise.(LAUGHTER)That was pretty funny considering he made a political contribution to the attorney general of Florida who at the time had an office investigating Trump University. And mysteriously the investigation vanished.(END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT: Former President Bill Clinton this week attempting to turn the tables on Donald Trumps as the fallout continues over Hillary Clinton's use of a private e-mail server and accusations of Pay-to-Play at the Clinton Foundation. At issue is a $25,000 donation Trump's foundation made to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi in 2013 at the same time her office was considering joining an investigation into Trump University. Bondi decided against joining the multistate fraud probe. And Trump was recently forced to pay a $2500 fine to the IRS for making a political contribution through a tax-exempt charitable group.We're back with Dan Henninger, Mary O'Grady, Bill McGurn and Mary Kissel.Mary, Donald Trump famously said during the primaries, when I give a donation to politicians, I do it because I know I can buy them.(LAUGHTER)O'GRADY: Yeah.GIGOT: Is this an illustration of that?O'GRADY: I think it is. I think frankly it stinks. But to hear Bill Clinton accuse Donald Trump of Pay-to-Play is really a joke, isn't it?  This is the guy who took how many millions of dollars from authoritarian third world regimes for his own pocket? I mean, give me a break here.GIGOT: So the Bondi episode is troubling to you, ethically?O'GRADY: I think so.GIGOT: Is that fair? Is that fair?O'GRADY: Absolutely.GIGOT: But it's a question of proportion?Is that the issue, Bill?MCGURN: Paul, I think it's two things. One is, the real scandal here is what's legal. If Donald Trump had made this a regular contribution, it would all be legal. It's because he did it through his charity. And second --GIGOT: That's why he paid the fine.MCGURN: That's why he paid the fine. But if he did it just as a regular contribution it would have been fine.GIGOT: What do you think?MCGURN: But it's still smelly.GIGOT: What do you think?MCGURN: I think it stinks. But the interesting thing about it the Bill Clinton defense is this is the classic Clinton defense, ""They're as sleazy as we are.""(LAUGHTER)GIGOT: Everybody does it, right, Dan?HENNINGER: Well, yeah, I suppose everybody does do it, Paul. But we're talking about politics. And you know, on a scale of one to 10, the Clinton Foundation is about 100. And this Bondi thing is about a two. I mean, you're just not going to be able to sustain this contribution to Pam Bondi over the next two months.On the other hand, Democrats all across the country have been pleading with the Clintons to separate themselves from the Clinton Foundation before the roof collapses on them. It's just one problem after another. And the Democrats are worried that there's going to be a landmine out there related to the Clinton Foundation that is going to blow up on them before the election. But they will not give it up. They say, all we do is good things with this charity --(LAUGHTER)-- end of story. That's not the end of the story.GIGOT: All right.But on the FBI notes released last week before the labor day holiday, conveniently, by the FBI, what did you learn from them, from that -- those documents that you think are significant?O'GRADY: Well, I think, first of all, it confirmed the sense that people had about Jim Comey when he decided not to go after Hillary Clinton.GIGOT: The FBI director.O'GRADY: Yeah. I mean, he -- first of all, by releasing them on that Friday before a long weekend, there was a real sense that he was just trying to get it out there but at a time when it wouldn't get much press.  And then inside of those notes. you find that, you know, all of her denials about never having, you know, used her private server to do anything related to classified information are just out-and-out lies. And the FBI knew that. They did not bother to interview her at the beginning of the investigation but rather waited until the very end, which is very unusual for the way that these kinds of investigations go.GIGOT: It happens, but not regular practice.O'GRADY: It doesn't make sense really. But there's a whole string of strange things that happened in this so-called investigation that really don't add up. And leave the electorate feeling like Jim Comey really did not do a full-fledged investigation of her because she is the Democratic nominee for the election in November and he didn't want to blow that up.GIGOT: Jim Comey issued a statement that leaked this week to former FBI officials, Mary, saying, look, I didn't do it, we only did it on that Friday, not for political reasons, we just wanted to get it out as soon as possible. You buying that?KISSEL: No. Nobody buys that. And I thought the memo was frankly bizarre and very defensive in its tone. Comey is clearly feeling pressure not just internally from the current agents working for the FBI but also from retired agents, and who knows what else. But he, as Mary said, has very clearly damaged that agency's reputation.MCGURN: I agree. Look, the situation we're in now is people not only don't believe Mrs. Clinton, they don't believe the FBI, because when you have to issue a memo like that telling people we don't play games --(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)MCGURN: -- it's because you're playing games.GIGOT: It's not a good look.MCGURN: And I think the thing is I think that within the bureau and former agents, they all recognize this.GIGOT: Mary, do you think that the Bondi example neutralizes, as a political matter, and for the rest of the campaign, the Clinton problem with the e-mails of the foundation?O'GRADY: I don't but that doesn't surprise you. Whether the electorate thinks so is a key question, especially these uncommitted voters who they're still trying to get. I think the reason why Bill Clinton found it so easy to explain what he thought happened in the Bondi case because he knows how it works and he's an expert at it. I think the magnitude of the Clinton problem is so much bigger than what happened with Trump that it's not going to be a big issue for Trump.GIGOT: Briefly, Mary?KISSEL: But let's be clear, Donald Trump paid a fine. What happened to Hillary Clinton for misusing all of this classified information? Nothing.GIGOT: Maybe going to the White House.Still ahead, U.S. intelligence officials are investigating what they say is a covert Russian plan to disrupt the American presidential election. So should the candidates brace for an October surprise?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: We know, based on our own intelligence analysis, that the Russians were behind the hack of the DNC and the providing of information for it to be disclosed from the DNC.Every American should be concerned about Russia doing anything to try to tilt and influence our election.(END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT: That was Hillary Clinton this week warning that Russia may be trying to sabotage the U.S. presidential election. Growing evidence that Moscow was behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee earlier this summer as well as breach of election systems in Illinois and Arizona has U.S. intelligence agency on high alert. So should the candidates brace for an October surprise?Gordon Crovitz is the ""Information Age"" columnist for the Wall Street Journal.Welcome, Gordon.GORDON CROVITZ, INFORMATION AGE COLUMNIST: Thank you, Paul.GIGOT: What do we know so far about the evidence that these were Russian hacks?CROVITZ: Let's first start with Russia's info war strategy generally.  Stalin had something called special propaganda. Vladimir Putin is a KGB officer, learned all about it, updated it for the digital age. And what that entails is trying to create disillusionment and distrust in democracies about their own systems, whether it's NSA or government officials or maybe now voters.  GIGOT: And he has tried to influence elections in Europe.CROVITZ: Absolutely. He hacked, or Russians hacked the Ukrainian Election Commission, Georgia. In the United States, we have 9,000 polling places across the country. We have many, many systems. We know how vulnerable every computer-generated piece of information is. This is why there's so much concern now about what the Russians might do next.GIGOT: All right. Let's take the DNC hacks first. The public officials, the American officials are saying they think it's Russian hacks -- Russians behind it. But they haven't laid out a trail of evidence yet. The FBI is still investigating. What do you think? Do you think it was the Russians?CROVITZ: I think there's no doubt that it was Russians. And it's not just the DNC. The Russians also almost certainly have all 60,000 of Hillary Clinton's e-mails, half of which, you will recall, she turned over.  Another 15,000 the FBI found.GIGOT: What is -- Jim Comey and the FBI said there was evidence that people tried to hack her e-mails but there's no evidence that they got in.  Now, they can reverse-trace those things. Why would you -- are you so sure that they have her e-mails?CROVITZ: It's much easier to reverse and determine if something has been hacked if it actually has any protection against hacking.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)CROVITZ: Her home basement service had no protection and intelligence the officials believe that many, many countries have her e-mails, certainly including the Russians. So the Russians hacked -- got her e-mails.  There's also evidence of hacking, as we discussed, the DNC, but also the Clinton Foundation and the State Department. So Putin has at his fingertips much more information than American voters do about Hillary Clinton, about the Clinton Foundation. If there's an October surprise relating to the e-mails, they may come from Russia. The Russians are able to triangulate all of this information that is not available --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: What it seems to me you've seen a series of public officials/Carter defense secretary, you saw the director of National Intelligence, Mr. Clapper, all point to Russian involvement. You saw secretary Clinton in that clip saying that Russia is involved. It sounds to me like it's almost preemptive, saying, look, if something happens in October that's who is at fault and, by the way, it's Trump's buddy.CROVITZ: Yeah.GIGOT: What do you think of that strategy on their part?CROVITZ: Well, I think they may have stumbled on to what is actually happening. I think it probably is the Russians.(LAUGHTER)Whether it is because they're trying to support Trump, I think is a different question. The Russian strategy is to create discord and disillusionment and distrust generally.GIGOT: Across the board.CROVITZ: There evidence the RNC has been hacked as well, the Republican National Committee. So I think the Russians are an equal-opportunity disrupter in this area. It's a separate question of whether Putin supports Trump or not.GIGOT: What about this issue of being able to disrupt the actual election, that is, the polling stations that you referred to? If you think about this, we have a close election, like a Florida 2000, and the complication, additional complication of the fact that there was some -- the accusation of foreign influence, I mean, we could have a real problem here with credibility of the next president.CROVITZ: Yes. The hanging chads of some years ago.GIGOT: Yeah. This would be much worse.CROVITZ: Much worse. And difficult to detect, and may or may not be found.One of the issues that people are concerned about to begin with is voting from overseas, where a lot of those ballots are transmitted digitally.  We'll start with that. And then there are the 9,000 polling places.GIGOT: What can we do to prevent that from happening? I'm talking about the polling place disruption?CROVITZ: I think it's very difficult. I think we've come to the issue quite late in the process. We don't really have systems in place. As you know, even the bigger government agencies --GIGOT: Get hacked.(LAUGHTER)CROVITZ: -- get hacked. Certainly, home-brew computers got hacked.GIGOT: So we don't want a close election.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: The other thing is the response that the United States has done to hacking in the past. All right? We know they brought charges against a few hackers, feckless charges, in China. We know they did almost nothing, the administration did, against North Korea for the Sony hack. Has that been a message to the Russians that, hey -- or anybody else, hey, you know what, you can get away with it?CROVITZ: You know, if there's no price to be paid, why not? I think that's what the Russians have learned so far.GIGOT: I think, yeah, that's a reasonable -- reasonable conclusion. What should Obama do?CROVITZ: I think there has to be some steps taken. Let's start with naming names, let's start with Obama and officially and on the record and not just unnamed officials. Let's start with that.But then the United States actually is pretty good at its own hacking and its own cyber activities. Why not disclose Vladimir Putin's bank accounts?  Why not the bank accounts of his cronies? What about all the visas for the children of the cronies who don't want to live in Russia and prefer to live in the United States? There's a lot that an administration can do to discourage this sort of Russian info war.GIGOT: Go on offense.All right, Gordon, thank you for being here.Still ahead, Libertarian Gary Johnson in the spotlight this week, but it's not necessarily for his strengths on foreign policy. Will his serious stumble hurt him as he fights for inclusion in the first presidential debate?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MATT LAUER, NBC ANCHOR: What would you do if you were elected about Aleppo?GARY JOHNSON, LIBERTARIAN PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: About?LAUER: Aleppo?JOHNSON: And what is Aleppo?LAUER: You're kidding.JOHNSON: No.(END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT: Presidential Candidate Gary Johnson taking some heat this week following that exchange on MSNBC. The Libertarian is holding steady at 9 percent in the latest RealClearPolitics national polling average, short of the 15 percent you need to participate in the presidential debates. But calls are growing for his inclusion, with 2012 presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, tweeting this week, ""I hope voters get to see former GOP Governors Gary Johnson and Bill Weld on the debate stages this fall.""We're back with Dan Henninger, Mary Anastasia O'Grady, Bill McGurn and Mary Kissel.So, he's a noninterventionist, Gary Johnson, Mary, that's probably a good thing if you're not going intervene in Syria, if you don't know where it is or where the capitol is.(LAUGHTER)What do you make of -- what do you make in general of Johnson?MARY ANASTASIA O'GRADY, COLUMNIST: First of all, I think we should establish for the record that he's really not a Libertarian. I mean, Johnson was a former governor of New Mexico. He had many mainstream Republican positions. He's in favor of gay marriage, which is not a Libertarian position. The Libertarians say governments should not be involved in marriage. He is in favor --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: And Mary knows Libertarians, OK?(LAUGHTER)O'GRADY: He is in favor of legalizing drugs, but largely because he believes that the prohibition on drugs is driving crime at the border and driving organized crime, and that's one of his big issues.Having said all that, he is not an interventionist and, you know, that's why he got into trouble here. I happen to think that there was something charming about the way that he responded to can question --(LAUGHTER)--- because Gary Johnson has some -- I would say a modicum of humility.  And the other two candidates -- which is one reason why he's doing as well as he is in the polls, because people look at the other two candidates and they think they're actually crazy and not suited for the presidency.(LAUGHTER)So they're looking for someone who is sort of low key, understands he doesn't know everything all the time, and can kind of take advice from experts.GIGOT: Dan, what do you make of Gary Johnson doing as well as he has in the polls? And how much is this going to -- this exchange going to hurt him? He's really desperately trying to get to 15 percent because if he can get there, or close, and he gets in the debates, that's what catapulted Ross Perot, for example, at the end of the race in 1992, the 19 percent he got. What do you make of Johnson's chances to get there?DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Well, they don't look too good.  I'm of two minds on this issue, Paul. There's a part of me that would like Gary Johnson to get on this stage because people are talking about him as an alternative. And let's find out whether he is a credible candidate or whether, like Martin O'Malley, the failed Democratic presidential candidate, there's just nothing there.Now, the cutoff is 15 percent, Paul. In the RealClearPolitics average right now, he's at 9 percent.GIGOT: Right.HENNINGER: That's a long way from 15 percent.And I would not favor just pressing Gary Johnson into the debate now because that means you would have to bring in the Green Candidate Jill Stein as well, and it would turn it into a circus. I think four dancing elephants are more than the American people can handle right now.(LAUGHTER)GIGOT: I guess the argument would be, Mary, look, Johnson to really have a chance would have to start winning some states. And if you don't have a chance to win any states, then the election is going to come down to Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump in the Electoral College. So should the voters get that to see those two go head to head without the distraction of a third-party candidate?MARY KISSEL, HOST, OPINION JOURNAL ON WSJ LIVE: No, I don't think so. I think rules are rules. He's doing well in Utah and New Mexico and a place like Colorado. Of course, that's a big Libertarian state, a lot of marijuana over there.GIGOT: They may carry Boulder. I don't know.KISSEL: He may carry Boulder. But the line is set at 15 percent. It's set by the Commission on Presidential Debates and I --(CROSSTALK)KISSEL: And I believe in rules.GIGOT: Any disagreement on that?O'GRADY: I disagree only in a sense that one of the big issues in this campaign has to do with government spending, and neither one of the candidates has explained how they are going to deal with this huge deficit and rising debt. And Gary Johnson would force them to have to --BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST: Interesting.O'GRADY: --say something about that.(CROSSTALK)MCGURN: That's what a debate is for. Debate is for who is likely to be president of the United States. I think we do have rules. 15 percent --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: Don't you want the issues debated though?MCGURN: I do want the issues debated. But I think we do have rules and not just let -- look, the harder part for Gary Johnson is the really tough question to ask people is, who is Gary Johnson. Probably more people could identify Aleppo than a Libertarian candidate.GIGOT: But isn't that the point then?If -- if the polls show, Mary, that the people are so public -- the candidate, neither, in some polls, are close to winning. If they're so disenchant we'd the main candidates, why not give somebody like Johnson a chance on stage?KISSEL: Because he has no mathematical chance of winning. The Commission on Presidential Debates, that's part of the criteria. You have to have a mathematical road to victory.And by the way, let's not discount the moderators here. Do we really need Gary Johnson on the stage to have a debate about how to balance the federal budge budget?(CROSSTALK)KISSEL: Isn't that the job of the moderators?(LAUGHTER)MCGURN: Right.GIGOT: To drive the questions, you mean?KISSEL: To ask the hard questions.GIGOT: All right.When we come back, the Obama administration's war on for-profit colleges claims its latest victim. So is putting Bill Clinton on your payroll the key to survival for these embattled institutions?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT: The Obama administration's war on for-profit colleges continues, and the latest victim, ITT Technical Institute, which shut its doors this week stranding some 43,000 students at its 137 campuses nationwide. It's a fate that did not befall another for-profit college, Laureate International Universities, where former President Bill Clinton was paid $17.6 million between 2010 and 2015 to serve as its honorary chancellor.Wall Street Journal editorial writer, Allysia Finley, joins us with more.So, Allysia, you've been following this story for us. What was the case against ITT, and was it fair?ALLYSIA FINLEY, EDITORIAL WRITER: Right. So ITT is a for-profit, meaning that it has shareholders. What happened is a bunch of regulators, a creditor, a creditor, as well as the SEC, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, levied a bunch of accusations, allegations that were never proven in court. And the Department of Education used these allegations as a pretext to basically cut off federal aid to students, shutting down the college.GIGOT: That would seem to be a violation of due process. I mean, do they get a chance --(CROSSTALK)FINLEY: Is that surprising?GIGOT: Well, you're saying that because of the Obama administration campaign.FINLEY: Right.GIGOT: They did this against Corinthian, too.FINLEY: Right so this is a pattern.GIGOT: Was the claim that they're misusing -- abusing students who rely on loans from the federal government? Is that -- was that the nature of the accusation?FINLEY: These are all very nebulous. But ironically, the CSPB and the SEC involve private student loans.GIGOT: OK, that the students took out to go to the school.FINLEY: Right, in which case, taxpayers are not on the hook.GIGOT: This is part of a broader campaign that the administration has had.  What's motivating it?FINLEY: One is that these for-profit colleges provide competition for community colleges, many of which are really struggling with enrollment.  And actually for-profit provide, in many cases, better programs, better suited for veterans, single mothers, non-traditional students, and that's really putting a crimp in the community colleges.GIGOT: Some politicians just don't like that competition for community colleges, which are public institutions?FINLEY: Right.GIGOT: And some of them are very good.FINLEY: Yes.GIGOT: But for the for-profits, some of these are online institutions, people who have to work for a living but want an extra degree, can't spend two or four years with mom and dad paying to go to school. Right? That's part of the attraction of some of these for-profit institutions.FINLEY: Right. They serve principally low-income, minorities, a lot of veterans, and those students who are in the military. But these schools are also not unionized. So Democrats don't like that.GIGOT: That's another issue.FINLEY: That's another.GIGOT: What about the performance of these schools like ITT versus, say, community colleges? Is the performance a lot worse or better or what?FINLEY: It depends. It's a case-by-case basis. But at least we know in the case of ITT that its graduation rates were, in most cases, three to four times higher than a lot of the community colleges in the nearby areas.GIGOT: What about their debt levels?FINLEY: They did graduate with higher debt levels. But because they earned more 10 years after graduating, they are better able to pay off their debt.GIGOT: Interesting.OK. Dan, so let's turn to Bill Clinton and Laureate. $17.6 million, that's higher than the minimum wage. What do you make of that arrangement?  And what was the relation of Laureate to the State Department and Hillary Clinton?HENNINGER: Well, I mean, it's just astonishing that a company like this would be paying Bill Clinton $17 million, to do what? It was mainly to be kind of a doorman, to introduce them to --(LAUGHTER)-- to people at the State Department, connect them to institutions overseas. They had institutions overseas. And nothing gets made of that.I mean, I think the underlying story here, Paul, having listened to Allysia discuss what happened to ITT and Corinthian, consider the incredible power of the federal government to literally put private companies like this out of business without any real proof that they've committed a crime at all.  What country are we living in?I would suggest as well that if Hillary Clinton becomes president, this sort of thing is going to continue. This is what the Democrats think -- is sort of the ideas Elizabeth Warren developed when she was head of the Consumer Financial Safety Bureau.(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: Bill, just briefly.MCGURN: Yeah. Look, I think the larger story here is ideological.  Remember Mencken's line on Puritans? We have to rewrite it. American progressives are haunted by the idea that somebody somewhere is making a profit. And that's what they're going to go after. This might have been money well-spent for Laureate if it had brought them immunity from the General Obama war on private schools.GIGOT: All right.Thanks, Allysia.Thanks, Bill.Thanks, Dan.We have to take one more break. When we come back, ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT: Time now for ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.Dan, first to you.HENNINGER: I'm giving my hit to Matt Lauer, the ""Today"" show host, who moderated the commander-in-chief forum. The day afterwards, every liberal pundit in Clintonista with access to a quick Twitter account barrel-bombed and carpet-bombed --(LAUGHTER)-- Matt Lauer because he was too hard on Hillary Clinton. So he must have been doing something right. But if the next commander-in-chief has to be protected from Matt Lauer, she's got a big problem.(LAUGHTER)GIGOT: He was just as tough on Trump, Dan, I thought.All right, Mary.KISSEL: I'd like to give a hit to U.S. hockey coach, George Tortorella, for telling his players this week, quote, ""If they sit on the bench for the national anthem, they will sit there for the rest of the game,"" end quote.  I think this is a good message, Paul. It's in response to San Francisco 49ers Quarterback Colin Kaepernick's refusing to stand for the national anthem and the raising of the flag in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. I think it goes to show, just because you can do something, it doesn't necessarily mean you should.GIGOT: All right, thank you, Mary.Bill?MCGURN: A miss to a Louisiana bakery that represents the latest chapter in the ongoing wars about who gets to bake what for what ceremonies.(LAUGHTER)This is not about marriage. An 18-year-old Louisiana girl named McKenzie Gill (ph) went to get a cake and she wanted a flag on the back and ""Trump 2016"" on it. The bakery refused her. She vented on Facebook and she went and got her cake elsewhere. So this is one young lady who bought her cake and ate it, too.(LAUGHTER)GIGOT: Mary?O'GRADY: Paul, this is a hit for the human spirit. This is the 15th anniversary of 9/11. And I was there on that day. I never would have imagined what lower Manhattan looks like today. There are 29 hotels in the neighborhood compared to six on 9/11. There are 60,000 people living in the downtown area. That's three times what lived there in 2000. And last year, there were 14 million visitors to the area. Human beings will not be defeated.GIGOT: Hear, hear, Mary.Thank you.And remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us at JERonFNC.That's it for this week's show. Thanks to my panel. Thanks to all of you for watching. I'm Paul Gigot. Hope to see you right here next week.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Fox News Sunday,"" March 13, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Chris Wallace.  Growing violence at Trump rallies amid accusations the frontrunner's rhetoric plays a role.  Today, we'll ask Donald Trump if he's responsible.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  Trump is forced to cancel a rally Chicago after hundreds of protesters show up to disrupt it.  DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  When they have organized, professionally staged wise guys, we've got to fight back.  WALLACE:  And Trump's rivals pin some of the blame on him.  SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Last night in Chicago, we saw images to make America look like a third world country.  SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  In any campaign, responsibility starts at the top.  WALLACE:  We'll sit down with Trump to discuss the violence and what he'll try do to stop it.  And we'll ask our Sunday if the protests will affect the Republican race.  Then, the GOP campaign reaches a turning point as the primaries turn winner take all.  In Ohio, Governor John Kasich battles to hold on to his home state.  GOV. JOHN KASICH, R-OHIO, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  When I win here on Tuesday, it's a whole new ball game.  WALLACE:  We'll talk with Kasich as he tries to stay alive in this campaign.  And our power player of the week: giving millennials the news in six-second chunks.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There was a large part of America that was being ignored.  WALLACE:  All right now on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  And hello again from Fox News in Washington.  This was the scene at a Donald Trump campaign rally Ohio yesterday -- Secret Service agents rushing to protect the Republican front-runner after a protester jumped a fence and charged the stage.  The concern was understandable, with growing protests and even violence at Trump campaign events.  All this as the GOP race reaches a potential turning point.  Five states go to the polls Tuesday, including Florida and Ohio -- both winner-take-all, and the home states for Marco Rubio and John Kasich.  In a few minutes, we'll sit down with Governor Kasich who says he'll drop out if he loses Ohio.  But, first, Donald Trump live from Chicago.  Mr. Trump, welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday.""TRUMP:  Thank you.  WALLACE:  Even before you had to cancel your rally in Chicago on Friday, there had been growing violence at some of your rallies around the country.  And some of the rivals, some of your rivals in the Republican race, say you have contributed to this with your rhetoric.  Question, sir: do you take any responsibility for the violence at your rallies?  TRUMP:  First of all, I disagree totally, Chris, with what you said.  I have by far the biggest crowds, 25,000, 30,000 people.  Last week, we had in Alabama, 35,000 people. And out of that, we'll have some disrupters, sometimes put there by other people.  But we'll have some protesters.  And nobody's been hurt at all.  And as big as the rallies are, nobody's ever been hurt.  We talk and we try and be good.  I will tell you, some of the protesters are very rough and they're bad dudes, and they swing and they punch, and nobody ever talks about that in the media.  If other people including the police, because it's usually the police that handle it, if they get a little bit rough because they have no choice, the next day at the newspaper, it'd say the police are rough.But we've had nobody hurt.  And when you think about it, when I have 25,000 and 20,000 people very routinely, by far the biggest, and we have some protesters stand up, who do you know that's been hurt over the last number of months?  Nobody.  Nobody's been hurt.  WALLACE:  Sir, let's take one example.  First of all, we've been running video that shows a number of punches being thrown.  I don't know that people have ended up being hospitalized.Let's take one example.  On Wednesday in North Carolina, a protester named Rakeem Jones was being peacefully escorted from the event -- I'm not saying he didn't do something provocative.  Yes, you can see he flips off a crowd, but then a man in the crowd elbows him in the face, knocks him to the ground.  Here's what the man says afterwards --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, he deserved it.  The next time we see him, we might have to kill him.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Mr. Trump, does that have any place in America?  TRUMP:  No, it doesn't, and it's a shame that it happened.  And I feel badly for everybody concerned.  And we don't condone violence.  But the kid did, from what I hear, stick up a certain finger right in everybody's face.  And this man has had enough, because I'll tell you what, people in this country are very angry.  They're angry at incompetent politicians, they're angry at losing their jobs, not having a pay increase for 12 years and more effectively.  Everything's -- this country is not -- we can't beat ISIS.  Our military is going to hell.  You look at what's going on with the vets, they're treated horribly.  They're worse than illegal immigrants.  We have a big portion of this country that's fed up.  You look at the Rust Belt and other areas of our country where jobs are being taken.  They're all being moved down to Mexico and other locations.  They're being moved out of the United States.  We have a president that doesn't have a clue.  He doesn't know what's going on.  And the people of this country are angry.  They're not angry people, but they're angry now.  WALLACE:  But you say and you just said again, you don't condone the violence.  But, sir, the record is clear and we're going to put up some tapes.  You have condoned violence in rally after rally.  Again, take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Just knock the hell -- I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees.  I like to punch him in the face, I'll tell you.  In the good old days, they'd rip him out of that seat so fast.  There's a group out there, just throw them the hell out.  That's OK.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  That sure sounds like condoning violence.  TRUMP:  Well, I'll tell you what -- the one -- first one, I was told by Secret Service that there were two people in the audience, they couldn't find them, they didn't know where they were, but they had tomatoes and they were going chuck them at me.  And maybe they had good arms, OK?  And, you know, being hit in the face by a tomato is not exactly so good.  So, before I saw them, in my speech, I said, folks, you have two people with tomatoes.  If you see 'em, do whatever you have to do to 'em, I don't care.  And you know what?  I think I'm totally within my rights to say that.But everything I say -- in fact, if you play 99 percent of the clips, I'm always saying, don't hurt 'em, take it easy.  Don't hurt 'em.  And I'm saying that to the police who are really mistreated in this country, by the way.  They're not appreciated for the great job they do.  But, usually, it's the police, it's not my people, it's the police in the various municipalities that I go to.  Honestly, they take -- they really take it easy.  And again, Chris, with rallies of 25,000 and 35,000 people, you don't know of one injury in any of our rallies.  And the one place where we could have had a problem was Chicago, and other than at your network, I've been given very, very good credit, very good credit for canceling, because if I would have had that -- we'll postpone it actually -- if I would have had that rally, you would have had a lot of problems.  And those were professionals.  I mean, those were real professionals.  And they weren't protesters, they were disrupters.  They were professional disrupters.  They came in with the Bernie Sanders signs right out of his printing press.  And they were disrupters.  And I will tell you, though, Chris, with all of the -- with all of the rallies that you've been witnessing over many months, you haven't had one person that's even been hurt.  And I'm sitting here listening to you tell me like, oh, like everybody's being maimed.  It's not that way.  And I have often said, do not hurt him.  You've heard me say that.  You don't want to play those clips.  WALLACE:  All right.  Let's move to another issue.  You've also created a controversy this week with your comments about Islam.  Here they are.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  I think Islam hates us.  There's something -- there's something there -- there's a tremendous hatred there.  There's a tremendous hatred.  We have to get to the bottom of it.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Now, Mr. Trump, there are 1.6 billion Muslims in the world today, 1.6 billion.  And according to the best experts, think tanks around the world, they say at most, 100,000 people are fighting for jihadist causes.  That's less than -- it's a tiny fraction of 1 percent.  So, why draw a battle line against an entire religion, including major countries that are helping us in the fight against ISIS?  TRUMP:  You're saying that out of 1.5 billion, 100,000, right -- let me tell you, whoever did that survey was about as wrong as you can get.  It's 27 percent, could be 35 percent, would go to war, would -- the hatred is tremendous, Chris.  Now, look --  (CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  Wait, wait, you're saying 250 -- you're saying 250 -- 300 million Muslims would go to war against us?  TRUMP:  Why don't you -- why don't you take a look at the Pew poll that came out very recently or fairly recently, where I think the number -- I mean, I could be corrected, it's whatever it is it is -- but it's something like 27 percent are, you know, really very militant about going after things.  And you'll have to look at it.  They did a very strong study.  And let's see what it says.  But it's a very significant number.  It's not 100,000 people, I can tell you that.  It's a ridiculous number.  But, look, there's something going on, Chris, when like it or not.  It would be easier for me to say, ""Oh, no, everybody loves us.""  But there's something going on.  There's a big problem.  And radical Islamic terrorism is taking place all over the world.  You look at what happened in Paris, you look at what happened in California recently with the 14 people killed by co-workers, by people where they gave 'em baby showers and then they walk in and they kill 'em, they shoot 'em.  They had no guns, they had no weapons.  They had no nothing.  They shot them.  They killed them all.  And -- I mean, there's something going on, Chris.  We can be very nice and very naive and say everything's wonderful.  All you have to do is look all over the world.  There's a great hatred out there.  WALLACE:  You also said this about the war on ISIS --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  We have to knock out ISIS.  We have to knock the hell out of 'em.  I would listen to the generals, but I would -- I'm hearing numbers of 20,000 to 30,000.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Which generals have told you, sir, that we need 20,000 to 30,000 U.S. ground troops in Iraq and Syria?  TRUMP:  Well, that's where I heard the number.  That doesn't mean I do that, by the way.  But that's what I heard the number is in order to eradicate.  And it could be quick.  You know, maybe we should do something quickly because this cancer is staying with us forever.  I mean, we've been fighting in the Middle East now for 15 years and longer --WALLACE:  But all the generals we've talked to say that's --TRUMP:  -- and we've been spending money at a rate -- and, Chris, in the meantime, our infrastructure in our country is going to hell, our country is in trouble.  And all we do is spend money in the Middle East.  I mean, either eradicate 'em or get out.  I mean, what we're doing is crazy.  We don't have any capability.  It's ridiculous.  (CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  But all the generals that I've spoken to say 20,000 to 30,000 -- I mean, yes, we may need more troops, we may need forward observers, we may need people, special forces to help, Iraqi ground troops.  But putting 20,000 to 30,000 American troops back in Iraq and Syria, they have grave doubts about that, sir.  TRUMP:  I'm not saying do, it I'm saying that's a number I heard you would need.  And I never said, do it, I said that's the number you may need.  But, look, let me tell you something, I whether you like it or not, I was against the war in Iraq, OK?  I'm one that said, don't go in.  You're going to destabilize the Middle East.  I was totally right about that.  So, I'm not like this big war hawk.  Bu now, you have people chopping off heads, you have people drowning 40 and 50 people in steel cages at a time, Chris, and now, we have to do something.  And the reason we have to do it is because of the power of weaponry.  They're looking to get weapons, and they're looking to acquire weapons that are going to be very, very horrible for our country if they ever do it.  WALLACE:  Mr. Trump --  TRUMP:  And we have to eradicate these people.  WALLACE:  I have two final questions I want to ask you.  Trump University, I don't have to tell you, has become something of an issue on the campaign trail with some former students saying it's a scam.  Here was one of them.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BOB, RETIREE/TRUMP UNIVERSITY VICTIM:  I was trumped by Trump.  I was duped by the Donald.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  But you put out a video this week in which you showed that same man's report card about Trump University.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Here's his report card on the school.  Quality of presentation, quality of everything -- excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent, all excellents, 100 percent.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  But now, The New York Times reports that that man, Robert Guillo, says that he was pressured to give the report card grades, the excellents, by his instructors who said he'd be fired if he didn't give 'em, and ""The Times"" talked to other students who say they came under pressure to give you good reports.  TRUMP:  Oh, really?  And they did that with 10,000 people?  Let me just tell you, this is a law firm.  It's a class-action firm.  They sue a lot of people.  They're trying to get money -- I don't settle cases.  I will go to -- I will go to court all day long with this case.  Almost everybody in there has given report card saying it was excellent.  We have an ""A"" from the Better Business Bureau, and you didn't report it on the show, in the debate.  You did something very dishonest.  You didn't report it.  You told me and you told the world watching the debate that we had a D --WALLACE:  Sir --TRUMP:  And we didn't have a D.  We had an A --(CROSSTALK)TRUMP:  Excuse me.WALLACE:  You know as well as I do, I didn't ask the question.  And --TRUMP:  I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about Fox.  WALLACE:  OK.  TRUMP:  I gave you the report card.  I gave you the A during the debate because they said it was a D.  And it was an A.  And I gave you the A from Better Business Bureau --WALLACE:  But don't you think you have the responsibility to check it out, to find out what's going on?  And the fact is, it's a little more complicated than that, because Trump University has been out of business for several years.  They're not getting so many complaints --TRUMP:  It's not out of business.  It's not out of business.  It's suspended until after I win the lawsuit.  WALLACE:  OK.TRUMP:  And after I win the lawsuit, hopefully, I'll be in the White House, and I'll have my kids, you know, my kids will open it up --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  But I promise you if Marco Rubio gave us a piece of paper in the middle of the debate, we're not going to simply start reading that.  TRUMP:  Oh, I think you would, I think you would.  Actually, here's the story -- you said Better Business Bureau gave me a D.  I said that's wrong.  I got -- during an intermission, I called in, they sent the A rating.  I got an A rating from Better Business.  I handed to Megyn Kelly, and they refused to put it on.  That is not honest.  WALLACE:  I think it's just wanting to check the facts.  But in any case, let me -- you'll like there last question, so bear with me on this.  TRUMP:  All right.  WALLACE:  Because for all of the controversy --TRUMP:  I'll love it --WALLACE:  I promise you, you will.  Here, you can tell me afterwards when you like this question.  TRUMP:  All right.WALLACE:  For all the controversies, you are doing very well now.  You have a solid lead in the delegates.  And as you pointed out, turnout is up considerably.  There's a 67 percent increase in votes in Republican contest over 2012, up 67 percent.  Twenty-three percent down in Democratic turnout compared to 2008.  You say that you have been leading a movement.  And I want to, briefly -- we have less than a minute -- explore that with you.  What's the movement?  What do these people want, and as what are the chances that you could effectively lock up this race on Tuesday?  Now, wasn't that a nice question?  TRUMP:  I think -- I like that question.  I like the statement, too.  I'm glad we're finishing with this.  Look, people have been disenfranchised in this country, great people, phenomenal people, people that have built this country.  They've been totally disenfranchised.  Trade deals have taken away their jobs all over.  Our military can't beat ISIS.  Our veterans are being treated horribly.  Our health care is horribly with Obamacare, where premiums are going up like nobody's ever seen before, 45 percent, 55 percent.  There's so many things wrong with our country and I'm going to straighten it out.  And people understand that.  We're going straighten it out and we're going to make America great again.  And that's what it's all about.  And there's never been, they say, in the history of this country what's happening right now.  And, by the way, it's been very friendly with no injuries, no injuries -- listen to you, it's like everybody, like it's a rampage.  There's been no injuries, Chris.  Remember that.  No injuries.  We did a good job by postponing the other day in Chicago.  No injuries, Chris.  WALLACE:  Mr. Trump, thank you.  Thanks for your time.  And I hope you and all the people attending your rallies stay safe on the campaign trail, sir.  TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  WALLACE:  Up next, John Kasich on his must-win strategy for Ohio.  Can he become the main establishment alternative to Trump?   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  A look outside the beltway at Cleveland, Ohio.  Tuesday is make-or-break for Ohio Governor John Kasich as he runs close in the polls with Donald Trump.  Kasich has made it clear if he loses his home state, he'll drop out of the presidential race.  He joins me now from Cleveland.  And, Governor, welcome back.  KASICH:  Thanks.  Thanks, Chris.  WALLACE:  I want to start with the growing violence at the trump rallies.  You say that he has sowed seeds of division, and we're now seeing the fruits of that.  You've called it a toxic environment.  What does all of this say about the kind of president Donald Trump would be?  KASICH:  He's not going to be president.  He's not going to have enough.  I'm going win here in Ohio with the support of folks here who have seen their lives improve.  More jobs, better wages, more hope, more people who have been ignored, who are getting attention.  And that's going to be the end of it.  He's not going to get to be the president of the United States.  And, look --WALLACE:  What about these rallies and his tenor at the rallies, sir?  KASICH: Well, I just have to tell you, you can walk into a room, Chris, or an arena or wherever, and you can prey on the fears of people, or you can go in and give them hope.  I go into my events and try to give them hope.  When he goes and pits one group against another and says the reason this isn't good is because of that group, that's not helpful.  And I think he has created a toxic environment.  That doesn't mean that there aren't some people who have attended his rallies who are intent on causing trouble.  But it's a mess.  And, hopefully, it will settle down, and we can move beyond this.  The last debate was far more civil than the ones before.  And maybe they're catching on to the fact that being positive may be the best way to run a campaign for president.  For me, I'm going to run -- I'm not going to take the low road to the highest office in the land.  And we're growing.  We're doing well in Ohio.  We're doing well in other states.  We're going to be very competitive.  And, Chris, don't be surprised if I go with the strongest amount of delegates into the convention.  WALLACE:  All right.  Let's talk about your path to the nomination.  After you finished a strong second as but in New Hampshire, you talked about your pathway being through the industrial Midwest.  But you suffered a disappointing performance.  You finished third in Michigan last week.  KASICH:  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Don't try to characterize what I did in Michigan that way.  WALLACE:  Well, I --KASICH:  I was about -- I was about 7 percent or 8 percent in Michigan and I finished with almost 25 percent of the vote --WALLACE:  You and your campaign -- excuse me, sir, you and John Weaver both talked about winning Michigan in February.  KASICH:  OK.  Chris, let me paint it for you.  I was at about 7 percent or 8 percent.  I split the number of delegates with Ted Cruz for second place, 43 percent of the late deciders voted for me.  We came out of Michigan with momentum.  There isn't anybody who's connected to the Kasich campaign that wasn't pleased with our finish in Michigan.   And you know what, that's the problem when we try to be fortune tellers.  I'm not going to be a fortune teller other than for Ohio which we're going to win.  WALLACE:  OK --KASICH:  We are with --WALLACE:  If I may, sir --KASICH:  OK --WALLACE:  No, but -- are you trailing at this point in Illinois.  You're trailing in Missouri, and which raises the specific questions I want to ask you which is, even if you win Ohio, aren't you just a favorite son holding on to your home state?  KASICH:  Chris, we're rising in Illinois.  There are going to be polls that come out that will show me in second place.  It's a matter of accumulating delegates.  And look, this -- for the last couple of weeks -- look, I don't want to be arguing about this.  I didn't get any attention.  When we had debates, there were people in the hall shouting my name to have me asked a question.  Finally, I'm getting heard.  Finally, the positive nature of the campaign is working.  Finally, people are beginning to realize that when I was budget chairman we had economic growth by the scores.  That in Ohio, we've turned this state around.  That wages are up.  We're up over 400,000 jobs.  I've cut taxes more than anybody.  And, finally, people are beginning to say, well, wait a minute, now I see who this guy is.  So, just give us a chance.  Most people never thought we'd -- most people never thought we'd get here.  WALLACE:  Governor Kasich, you're on the show today.  We're very happy to have you here.  I want to ask you -- I want to ask you about Marco Rubio because he has suggested to his supporters that to try to stop Donald Trump, maybe his supporters in Ohio should actually vote for you.  Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUBIO:  I have a voter in Ohio conclude that voting for John Kasich gives us the best chance to stop Donald Trump there.  I anticipate that's what they'll do.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Governor, following that same logic, should Kasich supporters in Florida support Rubio so he can beat Trump?  It's winner-take-all, instead of splitting the anti-Trump vote?  KASICH:  Chris, I'm not out to stop anybody.  I'm out to get myself elected.  And so, this is not like a parlor game for me.Look, I'm not in Florida campaigning.  I'm spending my time, I spent time in Illinois, I'm spending a lot of time in Ohio.  But again, I don't want to spend time in the process.  I want people to know that I have the foreign policy experience.  I also have the domestic policy record to show that I can take both of them and become an effective leader of this country -- bring people together, improve their situation, begin to solve some of the frustrations they have with their income, with their kids' future.  That's what I want to talk about.  That's what we're talking about in Ohio.  WALLACE:  Let's talk about an issue and one of the biggest issues in the Midwest is trade.  In the exit polls in Michigan, their last week, 55 percent of those voting in the GOP primary feel trade with other countries takes away jobs.  But you're on record supporting trade deals.  Here you are:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KASICH:  I'm a free trader.  I supported NAFTA.  I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are an interface against China.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Governor, are you telling voters in Ohio that NAFTA and the Pacific Trade deal are good bargains, are good for the Ohio economy, and that Trump is wrong?  KASICH:  Yes.  Well, first of all, simple fact is one out of every five Americans are connected to trade.  I was just in a plant in Dayton, Ohio, where the Chinese invested a half a billion dollars in employing over 1,000, you know, Ohio workers.  I was in a plant, invested by the Germans.  We have lots of people investing in our state.  That's why we're up over 400,000 jobs.  Here's the thing, Chris -- it's not just free trade, it's fair trade.  I've been saying all along that we need an expedited process.  I said it in the debate, an expedited process, when people try to rip us off and hurt the American worker, I will move immediately to block their imports.  And, in fact, in 2001, I helped to guarantee that the 2000 -- 2001 trade restraint so our steel companies could have a chance to breathe.  Fair trade but -- free trade but fair trade.  And I will act against trade violations.  WALLACE:  OK.  Fox News has gotten a hold of a video of Hillary Clinton on a trip to India back in 2005 when she was a senator.  She was asked about legislating, whether the U.S. might consider legislation to ban outsourcing.  She said no, but the she added this --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-N.Y., THEN-U.S. SENATOR:  Perhaps some economic incentives to at least think very hard before those decisions are made.  But, you know, it is a -- an inevitability.  There is no way to legislate against reality.  So, I think that, you know, the outsourcing will continue.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  What do you think of then-Senator Clinton's comments?  KASICH:  Well, I think -- I think the point on outsourcing, and I have talked to at least one CEO who wanted to move some operations out of the U.S. into the United States -- and I made it clear to him that there's more than just profits.  There has to be a value system that underlays our free enterprise system.  And before people make a decision to move out, before a board of directors authorizes this, they better be careful that they are not going to absolutely begin to hurt the concept in Americans' minds about the process of trade.  If I were on a board of the company and they wanted to go out there and outsource, they'd have to give me a very good reason as to why the survival of the company depended on it.  But just to make a few more bucks is not something that I encourage as to how to make a law, you'd have it tell me what the specifics are.  I'm open to anything that can put us in a position to protect the American worker, but at the same time not shutting down the blinds and locking the doors on our ability to dominate the world when it comes to economic activity which we do.  WALLACE:  Governor, I've got less than a minute left.  You know as an old TV host how that works.  KASICH:  OK.  WALLACE:  I want to ask you -- I want to ask you about Common Core.  In January, 2015, I asked you about other governors who had helped start Common Core but were now running away from it because of potential presidential campaigns.  Here was your very strong defense then of Common Core --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KASICH:  These were governors that helped create Common Core.  Chris, the Common Core was written by state education superintendents and local principals.  I've asked the Republican governors that have complain good this to tell me where I'm wrong.  And guess what?  Silence.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  But in the debate this week, you were asked once again to defend Common Core, and you never mentioned it.  Here you are again.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KASICH:  Frankly, education has to be run at the school board level with a little guidance from the state.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Let's clear this up, Governor.  Do you still --KASICH:  Yes --WALLACE:  -- supported Common Core, and are you prepared to say that Common Core is not, as you said in 2015, is not a federal takeover?  KASICH:  OK, we only have a minute, Chris.  Let me tell you, in our state, our state school board has adopted very high standards, and the curriculum is developed by local school boards.Plain and simple, you can call it anything you want to.  At the end of the day, we set the standards, and the local school boards develop the curriculum, plain and simple.  It's no more complicated than that.  We don't take orders from anybody.  We don't --WALLACE:  Is that Common Core?KASICH:  You're not going to get me to say -- Chris, you're not going to get me to start using names.  I'm telling you that it's about high standards and local control, and we need high standards in America.  So, our kids are trained for the jobs of the 21st century.  And that's exactly what we're trying to do in Ohio.You're a good man.  You're a good man, Chris.WALLACE:  Well, I'm not -- I'm not going to stop with you.  Governor, thank you.  Thanks for your time.(LAUGHTER)KASICH:  See you, man.WALLACE:  Always good to talk with you and good luck on Tuesday.KASICH:  Always good.  Always good.  WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the disruptions and debate in the Republican race.  Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the violence at Trump rallies and whether he's responsible for it?  Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Hillary Clinton is asked about the possible fallout from the FBI investigation into her private e-mail server.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JORGE RAMOS, MODERATOR: If you get indicted, would you drop out?HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Oh, for goodness -- that is not going to happen. I'm not even answering that question.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday group how the Clinton e-mail scandal is affecting her campaign, coming up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I shouldn't say it, but I watched -- I watched little Marco and I watched lying Ted Cruz.RUBIO: I still, at this moment, continue to intend to support the Republican nominee, but it's getting harder every day.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  After a brief outburst of civility, the Republican race returned to the more customary, personal insults this weekend.And it's time now for our Sunday group, GOP strategist Karl Rove, Julie Pace, who covers the White House and the campaign for the Associated Press, Kimberly Strassel from The Wall Street Journal, and Fox News political analyst Juan Williams.Well, we asked you for questions for the panel, and we got plenty this week about the violence at Trump rallies and whether or not he's responsible for it. Jenny sent this on Twitter, ""he specifically told them to punch people in the face. How is that not inciting violence?"" But Jean Cowburn wrote this on Facebook, ""Why are Ted and Marco pointing the finger at Donald? Do they always blame the victim?""Karl, do you expect all of this, about the rallies, the violence, do you expect it to have any impact on the vote on Tuesday? And if so, and I ask this as a genuinely open question, will it help Trump or hurt him?KARL ROVE, GOP STRATEGIST: Well, I think it will tend to help him. Let's divorce this two, this question, put it into two parts. Moveon.org, Black Lives Matter and others who -- who have announced their desire to break up Trump rallies by organized demonstrations inside the halls. This is reprehensible behavior, worthy of the (INAUDIBLE)  run by colonels in mirrored sunglasses. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton and the leaders of the civil rights movement have a moral obligation to speak openly to these groups and discourage them from doing so. Do whatever you want outside the rallies. Do whatever you want to do outside the hall in a peaceful fashion. But to -- to have, as an organized aim, like the leader of moveon.org said, to get into these rallies and disrupt them is fundamentally un-American.On the other hand -- and I don't want to make these morally equivalent because I don't want it to be cause and effect -- Donald Trump's behavior at the rallies -- ""knock the crap out of them, will you? Seriously, just knock the hell -- I promise I will pay for the legal fees, I promise, I promise."" I mean the declaration in his interview with you that he had a -- that people had a right to do this? He wants to be president of the United States.WALLACE: Talking about his supporters going after the protesters?ROVE: Right. Yes, and he wants to be president of the United States. What president had -- could you believe would indulge themselves in this kind of behavior?WALLACE:  So why do you think it's going to help him?ROVE: Well, I think it's going to help him because it -- people inside the Republican Party who support him say he's being a victim. And in a way he is. But he's also responsible for setting a tone. He claims that he can be presidential if he wants to be. It is time for him now to be presidential and to -- and to -- and to recede from this moment. Let the Secret Service and local law enforcement move these people out, but treat everyone in that hall with respect and set a tone that is worthy of our great country.WALLACE:  Kim?KIM STRASSEL, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, no, I agree. I mean, but I also agree with Karl that this is probably going to help him, too, because you have to look at Donald Trump's supporters. And a lot of them, they love the fact that he's anti-PC. A lot of them believe that when people are out there calling him a fascist, it's because -- for instance, he's anti-immigration. They don't like the idea that somehow those two are somehow equated. And so when you have these kind of protests going on, I think it's just going to strengthen the resolve of a lot of people to go out and vote for him. They feel as though that's the way you have to respond to these kinds of attacks.WALLACE:  President Obama was asked this week whether or not he bears any responsibility for the political polarization surrounding Donald Trump's campaign. Not surprisingly, he said, no.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: But what I'm not going to do is to validate some notion that the Republican crackup that's been taking place is -- is -- is a consequence of actions that I've -- I've taken.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Julie, are they really oblivious at the White House to how polarizing -- not specifically to say Obama caused Trump, but how politically polarizing this president has been? And if they are divorcing themselves from Trump, how about the -- the political revolution that's taking place, the populist uprising surrounding Bernie Sanders?JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: I don't think they're oblivious to it. I mean you do hear the president, in other moments, talk about how his biggest regret of his presidency has been that he hasn't been able to fulfill promises he made in his 2008 campaign to bring Washington together.WALLACE:  Yes, but, wait, because I heard him in that press conference and he blamed it all on the Republicans.PACE: Absolutely. I'm saying in other moments he does talk about how he bears responsible for not being able to bring Washington together. I think that when he looks at Republicans, though, when he especially looks at Donald Trump, one of the first things that comes to his mind is, during his first term, when Trump was pushing the birther movement. And a lot of Republican leaders -- I'm sure you did some of these interviews -- it was hard to get them to unequivocally state that Obama was born in the United States. That he was a legitimate president. So I think that when he looks at Trump, he looks at some -- something that through a different frame than necessarily what's happening on Capitol Hill, or the divisiveness that you might see in Washington.WALLACE:  You know, there's also a race that's going to happen on Tuesday, a big race, a turning point because you've got five big delegate-rich states voting, and two of them, Florida and Ohio, in addition to being the home states of Rubio and Kasich, are also winner take all.Juan, if you see Trump winning one or both of those, in a practical sense --not mathematically, but effectively -- could he wrap up this nomination?JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: It's hard, but it's possibly. And, clearly, he has the momentum now. If he wins both Ohio and Florida, though, keep in mind, Chris, he'd still need about 52 percent. So more than half of the remaining delegates. So it would be hard to say, he wraps it up.If he was to win, let's say, Florida, but lose Ohio, he'd still need 59 percent of the remaining delegates. If he loses both, 69 percent of the remaining delegates. So that's a lot.But, remember, beginning on Tuesday, we go into winner take all in several -- now the majority of these Republican states. That's a big advantage. So he could get a large share of delegates in a sweep. I was reading this week, Illinois, Missouri, two of the states that will vote on Tuesday, don't discount them, they've got a large pool of delegates, about 120. So if Trump does well there, it could offset a loss, let's say, in Ohio, where Kasich, at the moment, leads in the polls.WALLACE:  Karl, your -- your thoughts about what's at stake this Tuesday.ROVE: Well, Marco Rubio's candidacy, the viability of it is very much in question if he loses Florida. The viability of John Kasich's candidacy, which is poof if he loses Ohio. But let's put this in perspective. This contest is likely to go on. Donald Trump today has 460 delegates. The non-Trump forces have 636. So he's got to pick up a net of 176 more delegates on Tuesday than his combined opposition has in order to take the lead.Now, we -- we -- we enter after this -- this is the period, March 1st, the ides of march. We can begin have winner-take-all contests from here on out. However, the majority of the delegates elected after Tuesday are going to be in proportional or what are called hybrid or winner-take-most states. So we -- we are likely to have a very contested pattern right up to the -- to the convention itself.In the debate, interesting comment. Trump said -- was -- all the candidates were asked, well, what happens if Trump -- if somebody goes into the convention with a lead. And Trump said, well, I ought to go in to -- he said, I think whoever gets to the top position, as opposed to solving that artificial number that by somebody, which is a very random number. Well, that's called a majority, 1,237.WALLACE:  Yes. I (INAUDIBLE) that as well.ROVE: Yes. And -- and the fact of the matter is, is that we've had five of the 16 elected Republican presidents were not leading on the first ballot of the convention, including the sainted Abraham Lincoln, who was -- who was running third on the first two ballots and was nominate on the third. So this is likely to go.WILLIAMS: And what you hear -- what you hear from Republicans who are Trump backers is, there's going to be a great revulsion with the Republican establishment if Trump goes in leading anywhere close to having the necessary delegates, Karl, and if the establishment thwarts the will of the Republican voter.ROVE: The party will be bitterly divided in --STRASSEL: What will?ROVE: The party is likely to be bitterly divided almost no matter what the outcome is because if you go in and say, all right, I'm the guy who's got 45 percent of the delegates, but I deserve to have the nomination no matter what, the other 55 percent are going to have a lot of angry people.WILLIAMS: The party --WALLACE:  Right.WILLIAMS: The party has the trouble is in -- infraction (ph).WALLACE:  We have to take a break here, but the good news is that we only have, what, about four more months to be discussing exactly this and all the various scenarios.Up next, both Democratic candidates condemn the violence at Trump rallies as they also deal with their own issue, like the Clinton e-mail scandal.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT., DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The issue now is that Donald Trump has got to be loud and clear and tell his supporters that violence at rallies is not what America is about and to end it.CLINTON: If you play with matches, you can start a fire you can't control. That is not leadership, that is political arson.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders joining forces to attack Donald Trump for the violence at some of his recent rallies.And we're back now with the panel.Well, let's talk some Democratic politics. Sanders won a close but still shocking victory over Clinton in Michigan this week. He says it will springboard him to the nomination.Karl, one, does it at all change the overall dynamic of the Democratic race? And, second, even if it doesn't, what does it reveal about potential vulnerabilities of Hillary Clinton in a general election?ROVE: Well, this really was a remarkable victory. And the Real Clear Politics average going into the debate, there was not a single poll showing Sanders ahead. And her lead in the Real Clear Politics average was 21.4 of all those polls that were being run right up to it. And he eked out a 1 percent victory. He got a bigger break in the delegates because his vote was spread more widely across the state. He got 63. She got 58.But, look, it does not change. It -- it allows us to have more entertainment and excitement on the Democratic contest going forward. There will be other -- other -- other instances where, in states with substantial white populations in Democratic primary, that he pulls off a victory. She will win -- like that night, she won Mississippi, 85-14, taking 29 delegates to his four. And --WALLACE:  But doesn't it reveal some weaknesses?ROVE: Oh, absolutely. She -- this -- a systemic problem with her and the Democrats. John Judas wrote an interesting article last year saying the emerging Republican advantage. Blue collar people, working class people, are becoming unglued from the Democratic Party. And we're seeing that when they can't go for the Democratic frontrunner. However, look, this contest was over before it began because of the 712 super delegates. Seven hundred and sixty-six elected delegates for her, 551 for him. But among the unelected super delegates, the house of lords in the Democratic Party, it is 465 for her so far to 25 for him. And I understand they've got patrols out looking for those 25 and they are certainly (INAUDIBLE) --WALLACE:  Been rounding them up.Then there is the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server. And we showed you during one of the breaks how she bristled when in the last debate Jorge Ramos even raised the question as to whether or not she would drop out if she were indicted.Kim, on the other hand, with no sign that a grand jury has even been empaneled to begin to hear evidence in this case, this is going to take months at the least, yes?STRASSEL: Well, we don't know. One of the most important things that came out this week was the news that Justice has supposedly given immunity to Brian Pagliano. This is the guy who maintained her server at her house. He also was a State Department employee.And, you know, I would argue that people have all kept focus on the national security question, whether she mishandled the classified information. But, you know, Fox itself reported last month that in fact the FBI is also investigating this question about whether or not there wasn't some unseemly interaction between her official duties at the State Department and all the work that was done at the Clinton Foundation. And they seem to be looking at this very widely. So will that potentially take a little bit more time? Maybe. But she could be on the hook for something far more than just classified information.WALLACE:  There was another interesting moment in the Democratic debate this week when Hillary Clinton seemed to move well to the left of Barack Obama on immigration policy, when she in effect pledged that as president she would not deport any illegal immigrants in this country now unless they were violent criminals. Take a look at this exchange.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RAMOS: You would stop those deportation?CLINTON: I would stop --RAMOS: The deportations for children --CLINTON: Yes.RAMOS: And those who don't have a criminal record?CLINTON: Of our -- of the people, the undocumented people living in our country, I do not want to see them deported. I want to see them on a path to citizenship. That is exactly what I will do.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Julie, what do they make of that at the White House?PACE: Well, I mean, this is what of what we've seen happen with Hillary Clinton on a lot of issues in this Democratic primary and it's primarily the influence of Bernie Sanders, which is the Democratic Party has moved to the left and Bernie Sanders has really exposed that, broken that wide open. And if she sticks with some of the positions that she's had previously, even some of the positions that Barack Obama had, she's out of step with the majority of Democratic voters.I think if she becomes the nominee, there's potentially going to be a very important moment this summer if we do see a surge at the border, as we've seen in past years, where she's going to have to answer questions about what she would do with people who are coming across the border, young children coming across the border, families coming across the border. But, again, I think this speaks more to where the Democratic Party has moved and where Bernie Sanders has taken it than anything else.WALLACE:  Juan, let's pick up on that. I mean I understand the politics of Clinton trying to fend off Sanders and also her desire to try to mobilize the Hispanic base in a general election. But when you say that you are pledging, as president, you will not deport any illegal immigrants -- I'm not talking about Donald Trump's roundup of 11 million people, no illegal immigrants unless they're violent criminals, first of all, is that legal? And, secondly, do you run -- run the risk of a backlash in a general election by some people who may say, you know, we do need to do something to enforce our borders?WILLIAMS: Well, clearly, Donald Trump has stirred tremendous passions in the country on the immigration issue. I think that's really the launching point for his campaign is this anti-immigrant passions. In the Latino community, nationwide, so I'm not just talking about in Florida where everybody is right now in terms of the political focus, but I'm talking nationwide, there is a revoltion (ph) among the Latino community, not only about the anti-immigrant tone of Trump's campaign, but anger at President Obama for his high level of deportation exceeding what took place under President Bush.WALLACE:  But don't you think that a potential Republican candidate, where it's Trump or somebody else, is going to be able to say in a general election, really, you're not going to deport any illegal immigrant? The whole 11 or 12 or 14, whatever it is, they can all stay here if they haven't committed a crime?WILLIAMS: I think the contrary position, Chris, would be to say, and exactly how do you plan to deport all these people? Are you going to line up buses? Do you have a real --WALLACE:  President Obama's deporting them right now.WILLIAMS: No, he's deporting people -- he's going after specific targeted groups --WALLACE:  Right.WILLIAMS: At a very high rate --WALLACE:  Right.WILLIAMS: That, as I say, discomforting the Latino community. So, one, in terms of political passion --WALLACE:  Right, I'm just talking about continuing that.WILLIAMS: Well, I'm talking about in terms of political passions, I think the Democrats and especially Hillary Clinton feel the need to appeal to the Latino community on an issue that is number one in their minds. So I don't -- they're playing to that base. If you're asking about a subsequent backlash more generally, I don't see it, actually.ROVE: Look the -- what's involved here is a rule of law. The president of the United States has no authority to suspend the enforcement of our immigration laws in toto (ph) as Hillary Clinton proposed. And with all due respect, there's not one mind within the Latino community on this. You want to go down and talk to these mayors in the Rio Grande Valley, and they are irritated, angry it not people being deported, but not enough people being deported. And these are Latino mayors who understand that this influx of illegals, particularly children and families, is overrunning their social safety network.WALLACE:  Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week."" A political new startup finding different ways to attract readers and viewers.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  It's no surprise technology is changing the way we get our news. But what can still be a shock is when millions of us now get that news from companies that didn't exist during the last presidential election. Here's our ""Power Player of the Week.""(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)ALEX SKATELL, INDEPENDENT JOURNAL REVIEW: What we do better than anything is we help people experience the news. Show me versus tell me what's happening and I'll make the decision myself.WALLACE (voice-over): Alex Skatell is founder and CEO of Independent Journal Review, a four-year-old social media news company that targets millennials. It has found its audience. Thirty million different visitors a month, making it one of the top five news sites in the country.SKATELL: We have more Vine views than any other news organization in America, which are six-second news bytes of a story.WALLACE:  It was IJR's Vine on Trump's hands --TRUMP: But he said I had small hands. I've always had people say, Donald, you have the most beautiful hands. Actually, I'm 6'3"", not 6'2"", but he said I had small hands.WALLACE:  And Trump and Cruz at the last Fox debate.TRUMP: Civil cases.CRUZ: Not complicated. Count to ten, Donald, count to ten.TRUMP: Give me a break. Give me a break.COUNT VON COUNT, ""SESAME STREET"": One, two, three, four --SKATELL: When we think about the news coverage and the audience we're reaching, we want to create experiences for them which they value more than anything else. They want to feel like they're there.DAVID MUR, ABC NEWS: And the Independent Journal Review are honored to be here at Saint Anselm College in Manchester.WALLACE:  When IJR co-sponsored a debate, they created a 360 experience so you could put yourself in the hall. They got ten million views for this article, where a husband calculated it would cost him $70,000 a year to pay for all the things his stay-at-home wife does.CRUZ: Machine-gun bacon.WALLACE:  But what really put IJR on the map this election are its videos, like Lindsay Graham showing what it felt like when Donald Trump gave out his cell phone number.With replays on cable news, that got 62 million views. I met with their video team.I mean, seriously, have you all got attention deficit disorder?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. Yes.SKATELL: We're actually looking at the stats on viewership of these videos and you can watch after 30 second the viewership just tanks.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Plummets. It plummets.WALLACE:  Skatell was digital director for the Republican senatorial committee when he realized for millions of young people, their front page is now FaceBook or their e-mail inbox.SKATELL: I made a bet, and the reason I made the bet was because I was frustrated that there was a large part of America that was being ignored.We've had a really amazing month.WALLACE:  IJR now has a staff of more than 100 and is part of a company that also runs a Republican consulting firm, but Skatell says the news website is independent.SKATELL: Our editorial team is completely separate from -- and it's two separate companies.
