This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: Thanks for staying with us. I'm Bill O'Reilly in the ""What the Heck Just Happened"" segment tonight. New poll, again from the Pew people asking young people what they care about. In the group 18 to 29, they care about the World Cup at a rate of 24 percent. The Supreme Court decision, six percent. Violence in Iraq, 13percent. IRS losing emails ten percent. VA scandal 15percent. They don't really care very much about anything. Here now to analyze the young folks two old guys, Bernard McGuirk and Greg Gutfeld, author of the book ""Not Cool,"" which is a young person's expression, Gutfeld.And why don't they care about anything?GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST OF ""THE FIVE AND HOST OF ""THE RED-EYE"": It's no surprise. Soccer is probably the greatest thing ever in the world.O'REILLY: Yeah.GUTFELD: This is a sport that is so interesting it doesn't need scoring. Now imagine if you took all the scoring out of an NBA game, took away all those baskets. How much faster it would be. By the way, in Italian soccer means sleep.O'REILLY: Yeah, I know that.GUTFELD: But it's not surprising our country is in the toilet. So, we will look at anything, even soccer to take our minds off it. I actually took up nude Pilates with me and Dobbs in the park.O'REILLY: You and Lou Dobbs?GUTFELD: Yeah, in the park.O'REILLY: What park is that?GUTFELD: Brian Park about 3:00 a.m.(LAUGHTER)O'REILLY: Yes.GUTFELD: I pretend to walk a dog. Just got me off.O'REILLY: All right now, we've got absolutely nothing out of that answer. Do you have any reason at all that young people don't care about anything?BERNARD MCGUIRK, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF ""IMUS IN THE MORNING"": Of course, because we raised a bunch of common denominator nitwitz (ph). So I mean you say - you have Jesse Waters goes out and he documents the fact that he can tell a young person that the French bombed Perl Harbor, and they believe it. I mean them, you know, they think a misogynist or somebody who can give you a back rub. You know, they don't know Ghana from your momma. It's unbelievable.O'REILLY: So, you think it's the collapse of the educational system that's just driven the apathy?MCGUIRK: And that, and the way we raised them. We didn't tell them .O'REILLY: Challenge them.MCGUIRK: Exactly right.O'REILLY: In any way.MCGUIRK: If it's not trending on Twitter they don't care about it. I mean maybe if we had something ..O'REILLY: I think it's the machines. I really do. Because it is out of - and 24percent.(CROSSTALK)O'REILLY: No, the machines that these people carry that we had to take away from you right before the segment began.GUTFELD: That was a neck massager.O'REILLY: Because they - you can just blot out the whole world. You can just blot it out. Create your own insipid world, that means nothing and still be functioning.GUTFELD: But it's all good at - it's also has enabled more conversation and communication so you could argue the opposite that it has gotten people more in touch with politics and pop culture.O'REILLY: And then, would you have the poll that says they don't care anything about politics. What are discussing that I don't care about politics? That I'm not cool?GUTFELD: That's a fair point.O'REILLY: I don't know. I don't want to overwhelm either of you with logic, so let's go on to the next deal. This is a reaction to the Hobby Lobby Supreme Court ruling that said if you are a corporation that has strongly held religious believes we are not going to force you to buy a birth control device that may be you consider to be abortion. Here is how CNN commentator Ashleigh Banfield reacted.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ASHLEIGH BANFIELD, CNN COMMENTATOR: I started to think yesterday as I was trying to sort of digest everything I was hearing at rapid pace what if this were a Muslim family that owned a company and they were very strict in their religion, they did not believe that women should be coming to work unless they had permission slips from their husbands. Is this the kind of thing that they now could mount a case and take this all the way to the Supreme Court and heavens to Betsy there is actually precedent for a religious issue trumping civil rights laws? Alex?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, this is exactly the danger in this case.(END VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: Is it really?MCGUIRK: Heavens to Betsy, Bill. Hey, I'm glad to see I haven't seen that lady for a while. The woman with the hot glasses Ashleigh Banfield. I'm glad she landed on her feet. But the way she is talking it sounds like she might have landed on her head. I mean this is just - that's outrageous. She is engaging in Islamophobia in order to justify her religious bigotry.O'REILLY: It's the slippery slope that if you give a Christian concern this window that you don't have to do an abortion mechanism that they consider to be one. The morning after pill, that then everybody of the Muslim religion will be wearing burqas in the market place. And, you know, they'll force them to do that.MCGUIRK: Yeah. I'm for that. I would like to see burqa Fridays, the opposite of casual Fridays.O'REILLY: Burqa Fridays!GUTFELD: I don't need to see, you know, khaki shorts. I don't need to see people's knees. But, you know, this is the first time I've seen mainstream media concern about sharia law. It used to be if a conservative brought it up they were nuts. They didn't care about Hirsi Ali being banned from Brandeis for being a victim of sharia law. By the way she talks about Muslim businesses. She should give us a specific example of a Muslim business that might do this because it also, the case, specifically says this does not apply to other religious exemptions. So this is a completely bogus point.O'REILLY: OK. So you think that it's fabricated?GUTFELD: Yes.O'REILLY: For the sake of what?MCGUIRK: For the sake of just for politics. Political reasons.O'REILLY: Political?MCGUIRK: Of course it is.O'REILLY: To make the Supreme Court look like a bunch of fascists?MCGUIRK: To make .GUTFELD: Old men.MCGUIRK: The people who support the decision look like a bunch of fascists so that they can win at the ballot box.O'REILLY: Right. And I hope that Ms. Banfield isn't going for the younger market because only six percent of the 18 to 29 Americans cared about the Supreme Court decision.GUTFELD: Yeah.O'REILLY: Not a lot. All right. There is Gutfeld and McGuirk, everyone. Dennis Miller will return in this slot next week. And he would like you to know that the ""Bolder Fresher Show"" in Rapid City South Dakota on July 25, 95 percent sold out. Fargo, North Dakota the next night July 26th. 90 percent sold out. So, if you want to see us in the Dakotas you have got to get on it. Also, in the fall we see everybody in Boston, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, West Virginia.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Chris Wallace.  Donald Trump reaches out to black voters as polls suggest Hillary Clinton's lead is narrowing.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I fully understand that the African-American community has suffered from discrimination, and that there are many wrongs that must still be made right.  WALLACE:  Today, a debate between Dr. Ben Carson, a Trump adviser, and Congressman Gregory Meeks, a top Clinton adviser, on who has better ideas to help minorities.  Then, the other woman on the presidential ballot.  AUDIENCE:   Jill not Hill!  Jill not Hill!WALLACE:  Dr. Jill Stein, the Green Party's nominee, on her strategy for November.  Plus, Clinton faces new scrutiny over her responses to the FBI as a race against Trump begins to tighten.  We'll ask our Sunday panel how the new revelations will play with voters.All right now on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  And hello, again, from Fox News in Washington.  Hermine, the once and apparently future hurricane, has already claimed the lives of two people.  It's moving slowly up the Eastern Seaboard, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without electricity and it's set to do even more damage.  FOX News meteorologist Maria Molina is live in Atlantic City, New Jersey, with the latest -- Maria.MARIA MOLINA, FOX NEWS METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Chris.  That's right.  I'm here in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where the worst of the storm is forecast for late tonight and also into tomorrow.  Hermine is still well off shore, but as you can see behind me the water is already turning.  We have concerns for rip currents, dangerous surf and also beach erosion, and because this is a slow mover we'll be feeling the impact for several years, not just here in Atlantic City, but also across areas further off to the south, across Maryland, Delaware, and also extending north across portions of New England.  Tropical storm warnings and watches have been issued and a turn towards the north has not yet happened but it's forecast to happen later on today and it will slow down in forward speed, and that's why we will feel those impacts for several days.  The closer it tracks to the coast, the more we will feel those tropical storm force winds across coastal communities.  Another threat is coastal flooding especially during high tide across many of these areas -- Chris.  WALLACE:  Maria, thank you for that.  Now, to politics.  Donald Trump is continuing his effort to reach out the minority voters, visiting a black church in Detroit this weekend, and laying out what he calls a new civil rights agenda.  In a moment, we'll talk with Dr. Ben Carson who joined Trump in Detroit and Congressman Gregory Meeks, a Clinton supporter, about who has the better plan to help minorities.But first, Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy on Trump's stop in Detroit -- Peter.  PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, to get to the inner city church, the first African-American church he had ever visited, Donald Trump's motorcade had to pass through a rough part of Detroit.  And once inside the Great Faith Ministries, the Republican nominee told the congregation he can make Detroit a city the whole world envies again.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  We need a civil rights agenda for our time.  The right to live in safety and in peace and to have a really, really great job, a good-paying job and one that you love to go to every morning.  And that can happen.  (END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY:  Trump's speech that he said was handwritten was very well-received by the several hundred people who heard it and wasn't just optimistic and forward thinking.  It was reflective.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  For centuries, the African-American church has been the conscience of our country.  So true.  It's from the pews and pulpits and Christian teachings of black churches all across this land that the civil rights movement lifted up its soul and lifted up the soul of our nation.  (END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY:  Detroit native Dr. Ben Carson took Trump on a tour of his old neighborhood not far from the church before the nominee left town.  They met with residents, including the woman who now lives in Carson's old house and the informal visit fit with the pledge Trump made yesterday: to listen and to learn from the people he met here -- Chris.  WALLACE:  Peter Doocy reporting from Detroit -- Peter, thanks for that.  We want to turn now to Dr. Ben Carson who was a top Trump adviser and took the nominee to his hometown of Detroit.  Dr. Carson, Trump has been on the campaign trail now for 15 months.  This was his first trip to an inner city -- for a public event with African-Americans.  First, what took him so long?  And secondly, what do you think his trip accomplished?  DR. BEN CARSON, TRUMP ADVISER:  Well, first of all, I recognize that traditionally the Republican Party has not made an extensive outreach to southern communities include -- to certain communities including the African-American community because they have pretty much written that off as Democrat territory.  Donald Trump is changing that narrative and is really starting to talk about this in a very serious way.  And I've had many discussions can him about it.  He becomes animated during the discussions and this is a subject about which he cares deeply.And what is going to be accomplished is something that many in the Democratic Party fear, and this is an alternative -- an alternative to, you know, promises that are not kept, and look at the situation that's going on in our inner cities with the school systems.  You look at the incarceration rates that are going on, the broken homes, out of wedlock births, the economic situation.  This is not good.  And, of course, it doesn't apply to all blacks, you know?  But we have a substantial number of blacks living in our inner cities.  And if our inner cities are weak and are not prospering, how can the entire nation prosper?  WALLACE:  But let me --  CARSON:  And that is really the goal.  WALLACE:  But let me pick up on that, Dr. Carson.  Trump laid out what he called a civil rights agenda for our time -- education, safe streets, good jobs.  I want to talk about the first of those.  He calls for school choice, but we looked in all of his speeches during this campaign, we looked on his campaign website and nowhere does he explain what means by school choice -- how it would work and how he would pay for it.  CARSON:  Well, it is assumed that people know that school choice means you get a choice of your school.  You're not necessarily assigned to a school because of where you live and if that school happens to be dysfunctional, you just suffer the consequences.  That is something that we want to change.  We want to give people choice by a voucher system.  And it's very interesting that many people in the political arena are against vouchers and school choice and yet, they send their own children to very prestigious, private schools -- fully recognizing if you give a person a good education, it doesn't matter what their racial or economic background is, they basically will be able to write their own ticket.  This should be a high priority for us and it was for those who founded this country, and they talk about the need for an educated and well-informed society --  WALLACE:  But let me --  CARSON:  -- particularly Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson.  WALLACE:  But let me pick up on that, because Trump has called for abolishing the Department of Education, which gives out $1.4 billion a year in what's called Title I funds for schools dealing with impoverished students.  Here's what Hillary Clinton had to say about Trump and his outreach to African-Americans.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  It really does take a lot of nerve to ask people he's ignored and mistreated for decades, ""What do you have to lose?""  Because the answer is everything.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Dr. Carson, how do you respond to Clinton?  CARSON:  I would simply respond by saying it's really the Democratic Party that has the explaining to do.  They've been in charge of our cities for a long time.  The city I grew up in, Detroit, was once the most prosperous city in the United States -- some people say in the world.  From there, it went to the largest bankruptcy.  That was not a coincidence.  And we see that in our large cities across the nation under Democratic control.  That is a problem.  And when that is happening, what Donald Trump is saying, why would you continue down that same pathway?  The definition of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.  The result will not be different.  Now, he's talking about some real clear things.  We have had in depth discussions about the $2.1 trillion that are overseas, repatriating that money with no taxes with the stipulation that 10 percent has to be used in enterprise zones and to create jobs for people who are unemployed, underemployed or on welfare.  You want to talk about a stimulus, that would be the biggest stimulus since FDR's New Deal and it wouldn't cost the taxpayers one penny.  It gets corporate America once again involved in their communities which they used to be before the government took over and made a mess of it.  WALLACE:  Dr. Carson, Trump has a Hispanic advisory council.  But after his hardline speech on immigration this week, several members of that council quit.  Here's one of them.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JACOB MONTY, FORMER TRUMP HISPANIC ADVISER:  It was not a Republican speech.  It was not a compassionate speech.  I was very disappointed and I'm not going to be part of that.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Question: do you worry --CARSON:  Do you know what I would say?  WALLACE:  -- do you worry that you're being used as a prop and the support of Donald Trump will end up hurting your credibility in the black community?  CARSON:  It's not about me.  It's long time ago.  It's about our nation.  But I would suggest, Chris, go back and look at the 1995 State of the Union Address by Bill Clinton.  And see what he said.  He said, illegal aliens are creating big problems for us and we're going to put a lot more border patrol people on and secure our border and we're not going to have people able to work who come in illegally.  We're going to cut off their welfare benefits and we're going to deport people in record numbers.  You know, he says basically the same thing, but when he says it, wow, great, standing ovation, this is a great president.  But when Trump says it, it's hate speech.  What hypocrisy.  What incredible hypocrisy.WALLACE:  I've got about a minute left and I've got to ask you one final question and that is about the fact that the FBI released its files this week into the investigation of Hillary Clinton and her use of the private e-mail system.  Your reaction to the facts that were released?  CARSON:  Well, it's troublesome.  You know, she claims not to remember things.  Do you want somebody with an inability to remember in the White House?  Or do you want somebody who is a prevaricator in the White House, where you get a choice?  Or do you want to maybe go in a completely different direction altogether?  You know, everything is a coincidence.  I know it looks bad, but you know, it's not really that way.  We're really very honest people.  We don't use our office to enrich ourselves.  I know it looks that way and everything points in that direction.  But believe us, we're wonderful people.  I think at some point people begin to see through that.  WALLACE:  Dr. Carson, we're going to have to leave it there.  Thank you.  Thanks for your time on this holiday weekend, sir.  CARSON:  Thank you.  WALLACE:  Joining me now, Congressman Gregory Meeks of New York, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus PAC.  Congressman, welcome to ""Fox News Sunday.""REP. GREGORY MEEKS, D-NY, CLINTON SUPPORTER:  Good to be with you, Chris.  WALLACE:  Do you give Trump any credit at all for going into the inner city and meeting with African-Americans?  MEEKS:  No, because it's not real.  And Donald Trump has a career.  Here in New York where he's never -- this is his first time visiting a black church.  And so here again, you have what I think is a bait and switch scenario that Donald Trump is trying to put on and to, you know, in the words of Marco Rubio, con the American people, and instance, con African-Americans.  It's -- clearly, his record speaks for itself.  WALLACE:  You say he's trying to con them.  Do you think that Donald Trump is a racist?  MEEKS:  Well, I'd just say some of the things as indicated by the speaker, by Senator Scott, not by me, some of the things that Donald Trump has said clearly are racist.  They have indicated it.  That, you know, there were remarks that were racist in character.  So, I can only go by what one says and what one has done and clearly if you look at Donald Trump's record from the time that he started out with his father with the lawsuits until the very first statements and to not acknowledging David Duke immediately, to there goes my African-American, those are all statements.  What do you have to lose?  Those are all statements that I would say led one to believe that he has racist tendencies.  At least those are what his beliefs are if you believe what he says.  WALLACE:  But, Congressman, doesn't Trump have a point that things are not getting better in America's inner cities?  I want to put up some numbers -- 26.2 percent of blacks now live below the poverty line, 25.5 percent of food stamp recipients are blacks and black home ownership is 47 percent.  Congressman, all of those are worse since President Obama took office.  MEEKS:  But, you know, what we are doing -- where we are now is much better than when we were when President Obama was -- you know, took office in 2008.  WALLACE:  But those aren't better, those are worse.  MEEKS:  Well, we're coming from the greatest recession since the Great Depression and a lot of people lost their homes and the wealth in the African-American community and it's -- we have to build back.  That's why it's important that we have if kinds of policies that are being talked about by Hillary Clinton that would help build back and reduce income disparity.  That's why we also we have to make sure that we are raising minimum wage and focused on small businesses, which is important.  That's also where we have to make sure we're protecting historically black colleges and investing in historically black colleges for education and talking about education that's affordable and free for some, so that the key to tomorrow in America is a better education or trade.  These are all subject matters that which Hillary Clinton has been talking about.  WALLACE:  But, Congressman, do you hear anything in the very different Republican ideas about school choice, about enterprise zones, about renegotiating trade deals that have taken jobs out of America's inner cities?  Do you hear anything in those Republican ideas that you think maybe that's an interesting alternative?  MEEKS:  Well no.  I think that if you go to Washington, for example, there's an idea that Mr. Jim Clyburn from South Carolina put together called the 10-20-30 plan to help eradicate poverty in America and I think it's been embraced -- I know it's been embraced by Senator Clinton, but also by Speaker Ryan.  As some kind of dialogue that we can begin to have and to talk about, because I think that the issues, we've got to reduce the disparities that we have, because for sure the disparities are great within the African-American community.  But you've also got to reduce poverty.  And when we talk about issues of poverty, for example, we don't say that those Republicans that represented Appalachia for years are responsible for the poverty that is there.  So, we've got to have a deep conversation and I think the conversation could be had on a bipartisan basis, dealing with specific policy as the 10-20-30.  WALLACE:  During the Democratic primaries, Bernie Sanders went after Clinton in several cases from the left.  For instance, he noted that the welfare reform plan that she supported and her husband signed into law in 1996 resulted in more than the doubling of the number of Americans living in extreme poverty.  He noted that the crime bill that she supported and President Clinton signed in 1994 dramatically increased the number of blacks going into prison and the amount of time that they spent there.Isn't that part of the Clinton record?  MEEKS:  You know, I think that if you put into perspective what was taking place at that time and when you look at the crack epidemic that was going on, many of that -- much of that that took place at that time is taken out of context when we talk today.  If you recall at that time, the income disparity between African-Americans and others was shrinking.  You talk about unemployment was the lowest that it had been.  In fact, so many good things were happening in the African-American community that some was calling Bill Clinton at the time the first African-American president.  So, you don't speak of that now, but when you think of small businesses in which Hillary Clinton is focused on, and investment in urban America and the inner cities, creating businesses and opportunities for African-American communities, utilizing minority businesses, that was all positive and something that Hillary Clinton talks about today.  WALLACE:  Finally, again, I have about a minute left for this.  I want to ask you to respond to what Dr. Carson said about the release of the FBI files and to the e-mails.  More than two dozen times during that interview with the FBI, Hillary Clinton said she could not recall, did not remember key events.  It turns out she didn't have one BlackBerry as she had told the press, it turns out she had 15.  Your response?  MEEKS:  My response is that it's clear: Hillary Clinton has gone through several hearings in Congress.  Now, you've heard the FBI director say that there's nothing that she did that was criminal, or anything of that nature.WALLACE:  He didn't say it was criminal.  But he did say it was negligent and extremely careless.  MEEKS:  Yes. You heard that the secretary say that if she had a chance to do it again, she wouldn't have done it.  She's been apologetic about it.  But there's been nothing, there's been no smoking gun, as Republicans talked about.  You heard my colleague on the Republican side, McCarthy, said this all from the beginning, whether you talked about Benghazi or other items, was just to try to discredit Hillary because when you talk about policy issues and how we take this country forward, you can't compare.  And so, you try to divert, whether -- you know, so there's no smoke and no fire.  WALLACE:  Congressman Meeks, thank you.  Thanks for coming in today.  We'll look forward to talking to you again, sir.  MEEKS:  Thank you.  WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss Trump's trip to Detroit, reaching out to black voters.  Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the Trump's inner city events?  Will his pitch resonate?Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and we may use your question on the air.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  I believe we need a civil rights agenda for our time, one that ensures the rights for a great education -- so important -- and the right to live in safety and in peace and to have a really, really great job.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Donald Trump reaching out the black voters in an African-American church in inner city Detroit yesterday.And it's time now for our Sunday group.  Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume, Neera Tanden, president of the liberal think tank, the Center for American Progress, Anne Gearan of The Washington Post, and syndicated columnist George Will.  Brit, first of all, welcome back.  BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Thank you.WALLACE:  What do you think of Trump's visit to Detroit and that black church yesterday?  And what do you think of his outline in broad strokes of an agenda for civil rights?  HUME:  Well, I think it was probably worth a try.  But I sense that he will probably get more credit with white voters for making the effort than he will from voters in the inner city whose resistance to appeals from Republicans going back decades has been remarkably strong.  So I doubt he'll make, you know, any inroads of any consequence in that particular segment of the electorate.  But nonetheless, you had people looking to find way that they could possibly support him.  We'll see the soft-spoken version of Donald Trump making what I think are some, you know, detailed and serious sounding at least proposals and that might do him some good, but probably not within that community.  WALLACE:  Neera, if Trump weren't talking about these issues you'd criticize him.  Are you going to criticize him for talking about these issues?  NEERA TANDEN, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS:  I think the fact that he's at zero percent of support amongst some swing states of African-Americans is heretofore well-deserved of his policies.  I think the fact that you pointed out that these policies are not on his website and his history.  I mean, I think the reality here is most African-Americans have come to know him from his attacks on the first African-American president, with his birtherism, but also his history.  ""The New York Times"" has a long, detailed story last week about Trump Industries and a history of housing discrimination that goes back 30 years.  So, I think there's a long record here and two months before the election, have never gone into the black church or engaged in discussions with black audiences, I think people see this as a transparent -- transparent attempt to make up something where he's far behind McCain's numbers, and Romney's numbers with African-Americans, which weren't strong, that he's so far behind them.  WALLACE:  George?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST:  Just two months before the election, we're 19 days before the voting starts in some states, and Mr. Trump is saying, essentially, ""Never mind what I have said so far, I'm going to change.""He's campaigned for 400 days after announcing his candidacy and then said, I've got some regrets.  He didn't say what they were, but he said, I've got some regrets.  He goes to the black church, reiterates standard Republican views, school choice and all the rest, but people are supposed to forget he's a birther, at least he was.  He's the one who said that he'd sent -- five years ago, he sent out investigators to Hawaii to investigate the president's birth and people are going to be amazed by what they found.  He hasn't told us, but that's -- again, they're supposed to forget that.  He goes to Mexico and says, people I have described of rapists are now exemplary Americans.  And then he goes to phoenix and he chooses to be introduced by Joe Arpaio, the sheriff of Maricopa County, who's the very face of hostility to immigrants.  I don't think it will work.  Obviously, the Hispanic vote like all African-Americans are quite monolithic, but still what should worry Republicans most of all is in 2012, Mitt Romney did even worse among Asian-Americans than he did with Hispanics, which indicate that minorities generally do not feel welcomed into the Republican Party.  WALLACE:  Brit, are you as resistant to his outreach to minority voters as Brother Will here?  HUME:  Well, there's a contrast obviously between the soft-spoken man speaking in that church yesterday and the bombastic Trump of days before -- you know, before, when we heard so much of, which suggests to me the impression that African-American voters and other minorities may have of him may be sitting in cement.  Which is why I -- you know, all the things that he cites are part of the reason why I think he'll have trouble rallying what support if any in the community where, as Neera pointed out, he stands in some states at zero.  WALLACE:  Yes, that's bad.  (LAUGHTER)WALLACE:  All right.  Let's turn to the issue of Hispanics because Trump also tried to make an outreach this week to the Hispanic community.  A couple of weeks of talking about softening his position on mass deportations.  Then, as we see in the middle of the week, he went on Wednesday to Mexico City and met and had a respectful press conference afterwards with Mexican President Pena Nieto, sounding a diplomatic note.But later that same day in Phoenix, he said that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone.  You can call it deported if you want.  The press doesn't like that term.  You can call it whatever the hell you want.  They're gone.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  And Trump was talking there specifically about illegal immigrants who commit further crimes.  Not just coming across the border illegally, but further crimes once they get in.  But despite that specific point, for all of this back and forth over the last two weeks, was he going to soften, was he going to harden, did it do him any good with Hispanic voters?  (END VIDEO CLIP)ANNE GEARAN, THE WASHINGTON POST:  Well, probably not a great deal.  I mean, you see the dueling efforts here of Kellyanne Conway and a group of other Trump advisers who are pulling him in opposite directions on what he should be doing to at least give a credible sense of outreach and openness to Hispanic voters.  She's a pollster.  She's a demographer.  She sees the ultimate imperative of his having to have an outreach to Hispanic voters and for Republicans to have an outreach to Hispanic voters past this election, whatever happens to it.  She's doing at some -- making some effort to have him make that outreach.  I think what you're left with here is you can pick which Trump you like from five hours apart, right?  They were different people saying different things.  And Hispanic voters are going to look at both of those images and certainly more likely see that what he said in Phoenix as the real Donald Trump.  WALLACE:  But I want to pick up on this with you, George.  Let me begin first of all with this question, because we asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on Twitter from Ron who tweets, voters have their minds made up, especially the African-American voters.  So, George, let me ask you, first of all, how do you answer Ron?  But also, about what this point you heard from Ben Carson, that you hear from Donald Trump -- look, you've had decades of Democratic government in America's inner cities, they control -- they're the bosses in most of the elected cities and things have not gotten better in a lot of places and, as pointed out in some statistics, they've actually gotten worse?  WILL: It's indisputably true what Ben Carson says. The blue model of government, so-called the alliance of the Democratic Party and the public employees unions, particularly the teachers unions standing thwart school choice, has not served the African community well -- African-American community, that's in the cities. That said, there seems no -- there's no reason to believe that the standard Republican appeal, school choice, welfare reform, all the rest, that Jack Kemp brought to American politics -- he ran as the running mate of Bob Dole -- has no effect so far as I can tell and I don't see it having an effect this time around.WALLACE: All right, we have to take a break here, but we'll see you, panel, a little later.Up next, the Green Party's presidential nominee, Jill Stein, on appealing to voters who are unhappy with the choice of Trump or Clinton.Plus, what do you think? Will the third party candidates be real factors in the November election? Let me know on FaceBook or Twitter @foxnewssunday and use the #fns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Coming up, the FBI releases documents in its Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I did not e-mail any classified material to anyone on my e-mail.JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR: There was classified material e-mailed.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel how the ongoing controversy will affect her campaign, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  She's the other woman on the presidential ballot, a doctor and the Green Party's 2012 candidate for president. This year, Dr. Jill Stein is back on the campaign trail, once again, the Green Party's presidential nominee.Dr. Stein, welcome to ""Fox News Sunday.""DR. JILL STEIN, GREEN PARTY PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Good to be with you, Chris.WALLACE:  Let's start with your platform in this campaign and we're going to put it up on the screen. You call for Medicare for all, a guaranteed federal job for anyone who wants one, free college tuition, canceling all student loan debt, cutting military spending by 50 percent and ending all wars and all drone attacks.Dr. Stein, how much will that cost and how are you going to pay for it?STEIN: So let me say first, we don't call for ending all wars, but we call for ending these catastrophic regime change wars that have cost us $6 trillion by the time we've paid for the health care of our wounded veterans. That's according to a recent Harvard study. And, remember, this is half -- more than half of our discretionary budget. So that's part of how we pay for things.Another way we pay for things, in fact, we call for a green new deal, an emergency jobs program to fix the emergency of climate change. And the great thing, Chris, is that this program pays for itself. And I can say this as a medical doctor, it turns out we get so much healthier by eliminating fossil fuel pollution -- 200,000 deaths every year, in fact, from fossil fuel pollution. We get so much healthier that the savings in health care alone is enough to pay for the green energy transition.WALLACE:  Now, The Washington Post --STEIN: And something like --WALLACE:  Well, let me just -- let me just pick up. The Washington Post is a pretty liberal newspaper.STEIN: Go ahead.WALLACE:  After interviewing you, this is an editorial that they wrote. The headline, ""Jill Stein's fairy-tale candidacy."" And in it they said this. ""Jill Stein's policy ideas are poorly formed and wildly impractical.""Dr. Stein, that's not good.STEIN: Well, I think they called me actually a fairy tale campaign, to which I would answer, in fact we are living with a couple of nightmare campaigns right now that the American people object to at absolutely unprecedented levels. The American people are saying that politics as usual has been throwing them under the bus and, in fact, the two major party candidates have the highest ratings of disapproval and distrust of any candidate anywhere at any time throughout our history.So what I'm saying is what the American people are calling for. Seventy-six percent of Americans are saying, we need to open up the debates. There are actually four candidates on the ballot for just about every American and in America we not only have a right to vote, we have a right to know who we can vote for. Donald Trump actually has received more than $4 billion in free media and Hillary Clinton over $2 billion. I've received almost none and yet, still, I'm coming up 4 or 5 percent in the polls with zero media, which tells you there is word of mouth going on out there because a generation of young people is locked in to debt.And referring to your question about how do we pay for it? Somehow we came up with the money, it turned out to be about $16 trillion, to bail out the crooks on Wall Street who crashed the economy. Isn't it time that we bail out an entire generation that's basically been locked in debt, doesn't have the jobs to earn their way out of that college debt. What is more important to us than liberating a generation who can lead the way forward --WALLACE:  Let me --STEIN: Not only on our economy, but in all of the social issues that we have in front of us.WALLACE:  Let me pick --STEIN: It's always been young people who have lead the charge.WALLACE:  Let me pick up on another aspect of your plan, and that's the -- the -- the -- the foreign policy aspect. You call for cutting Pentagon spending in half. You would like to eliminate -- you say you would like to eliminate, although you have a caveat there you may not be able to -- all military bases, U.S. military bases around the world. A question, how would you fight ISIS?STEIN: Ah, very good point. We would not continue to do the same thing that has failed catastrophically since 9/11, since the trade towers came down, because what have we done with that $6 trillion, mind you, to just Iraq and Afghanistan alone, which, by the way, costs every American household $50,000 for those two wars alone. What have we done with this policy of regime change, this war on terror? We've created failed states, mass refugee --WALLACE:  OK, but how would you fight ISIS?STEIN: I'll tell you in one second. Failed states, mass refugee migrations and worse terrorist threats. Which is the point, it's not getting better. Every terrorist cause we've been fighting has only been increased and gotten stronger by dropping bombs and shooting them up with bullets. We need a weapons embargo to the Middle East since we are supplying the majority of weapons, which get out to all sides. We call for a weapons embargo and we call for a freeze on the funding, including our allies. Hillary Clinton identified the Saudis as still the major funder of Sunni Jihad terror around the world.WALLACE:  But -- but -- but what are you going to do about -- about ISIS and the people in Iraq and Syria who have also now developed plans, they have struck in the United States. They've struck in France. They've struck in -- in Belgium and a number of other places. How are you going to protect us from them?STEIN: So, one thing we have to do is not keep doing what we've been doing, which has only made them stronger. Each terrorist threat has gotten worse. We created ISIS out of the chaos of Iraq. So let's not keep doing a proven failed strategy. That's why we're calling --WALLACE:  I -- I understand what you say we shouldn't do. What should we do?STEIN: Yes. What we should do is deprive them of weapon, deprive them of funding, freeze the bank accounts of our allies that continue to fund these terrorist enterprises and close the border from Turkey so that the militias cannot cross over into Iraq and into Syria.WALLACE:  You -- you told --STEIN: We created this problem by funding it, by arming it. We and our allies. Remember, this goes back to Afghanistan, where we created this in order to fight the Russians and the Soviet Union by beefing up the Mujahedeen and creating this international terrorist (INAUDIBLE).WALLACE:  I -- I think a lot of people are going to question --STEIN: The Saudis continue to fund the Madrasas (ph) --WALLACE:  I -- we -- we have to move on, but let me -- let me simply say, I think a lot of people are going to question whether we were responsible for al Qaeda and we were responsible for ISIS. But let me -- let me move on because you -- you talked about the fact that you said --STEIN: This is why it should be debated, Chris.WALLACE:  Well, I -- that's why we have you -- that's why we're having you on this show, Dr. Stein.STEIN: This is why it should be debated, because the American people are not happy with the way it's going right now.WALLACE:  But let me -- let me ask you --STEIN: Well, I think -- I think a lot of people pay attention to our presidential debates.WALLACE:  Let -- let me ask you, if I -- if I may about -- about Hillary Clinton, because you talk about hers as a nightmare candidacy. You've said some pretty tough things about her. You've said that she had a -- has had a ""horrific"" career, your words. You say that she's ""too big to jail."" What's wrong with Hillary Clinton?STEIN: Well, what I said about Hillary Clinton is that she cannot be the good guy in the white hat while Donald Trump is the bad guy in the black hat. Donald Trump says despicable things, but Hillary Clinton, unfortunately, has a record for doing many terrible things. Donald Trump talks about deporting Muslims. Unfortunately, Hillary Clinton has been bombing Muslims. A million people killed in Iraq alone. And we've only created a greater catastrophe there.The Republicans are the party of hate and fear mongering. But the Democrats are the party of deportation, detention and night raids for immigrants who, in many cases, have been forced to flee into this country as refugees from NAFTA, which Hillary Clinton and Bill gave the thumbs up to. In fact, signed. And Wall Street deregulation --WALLACE:  Dr. --STEIN: Which led to the disappearance of 9 million jobs here in America.WALLACE:  Dr. Stein --STEIN: So the things that are terrible right now in our economy are very much -- go back to the policy of the Clintons as much as the Republicans.WALLACE:  Dr. Stein, we're going to have to leave it there. We thank you very much for coming on. And you can't say that you've had zero media exposure anymore because you've been here. Thanks so much.STEIN: And I appreciate it. And I look forward to getting into the debates so the American people can hear the full story.WALLACE:  Thank you.When we come back, the FBI releases files from its investigation and interview of Hillary Clinton. We'll bring back our Sunday group to discuss what she told them and the impact it will have on her campaign.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR: She should have known not to send classified information. I -- as I said, that's the definition of negligent. I think she was extremely careless. I think she was negligent.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  FBI Director James Comey telling Congress, while he didn't see grounds for prosecution, Hillary Clinton mishandled classified material on her private server while she was secretary of state.And we're back now with the panel.So, Brit, in her FBI interview, by one count, Clinton said 27 times that she did not recall or could not remember key events and details. As for the e-mails about drone attacks and CIA assets, she said that she relied on her staff. And if they sent her something, she assumed it was not classified. Do you find those explanations were failure to recall persuasive?HUME: Of course not. And I don't think many normal people would. And it simply furthers this impression people have that this is an extraordinarily exceptionally secretive and even indeed dishonest person now running for the highest office in the land. Under normal circumstances, such things as the mishandling of classified information, negligence in the handling of classified information would be utterly disqualifying. In this particular year, under the circumstances, given the nature of the opposing candidate, she's ahead. Whether over time this stuff -- and there's likely to be more of it -- will weigh her down to the point where people just might find it in their hearts to vote for the alternative is the question. Based on the polling we've seen so far, it doesn't look like it will be enough. But it's something to watch out for.WALLACE:  Neera, we should point out you are close to the Clinton campaign. You've been an adviser to her over the years. We all know Hillary Clinton is whip smart. So how do you explain her vagueness on all these events and even saying that she didn't really understand how the classification system worked?TANDEN: No, she didn't say she didn't understand how the classification system worked. I mean I think what's good about this is that everyone can read these documents. I've read them. I know --WALLACE:  She said she didn't really understand the difference between --TANDEN: No, she said --WALLACE:  Between various levels of classification --TANDEN: No, she --WALLACE:  And the ""c"" marking, she said she didn't understand that at all.TANDEN: She said that she took all the classifications very seriously. So she didn't differentiate in the way she handed because all of them were seriously (ph). That's what she said in the testimony.WALLACE:  Which is why she did it --TANDEN: I think that this issue --WALLACE:  Which is why she did it on their private e-mails.TANDEN: And I -- and I think this issue -- I think the issue of the e-mails is, she has -- I -- I -- I recommend people read this. There's 27 or so e-mails that she's asked to remember out of 60,000. She couldn't recall each one of those e-mails. But you see in the process that she --WALLACE:  No, no, no. No, wait, wait, wait. That's not quite true. She says at various -- it isn't just e-mails. She says --TANDEN: It's -- no, no.WALLACE:  No, she's asked, do you remember when you were told how the classification system worked, and she said she didn't remember that specific briefing.TANDEN: Right, out of the 20 --WALLACE:  That's not an e-mail. That's a briefing.TANDEN: Exactly. Let's just be clear. I want to be crystal clear about this. Out of the 27 times Brit mentioned, many of them are e-mails. So that's what I'm saying.WALLACE:  OK, that's different.TANDEN: That's what I'm saying. I want to be crystal clear about that.So I think the important thing here is just to step back. That we have had this massive investigation into this effort. There -- you see from this why the FBI did not move forward with any other action on this. And I think she's recognized that this was a mistake to set up the server.WALLACE:  OK. Let me --TANDEN: And -- and she's said that multiple times.WALLACE:  I'm going to pick up on one other --TANDEN: Whereas, I just need to say --WALLACE:  I -- I do want to pick up on one other aspect of this.TANDEN: I'm sure. But I just need to say that we have not had -- we -- we -- we've had a full discussion of this. But we just learned this week that Donald Trump --WALLACE:  OK.TANDEN: Is engaged in a -- was engaged in pay to play --WALLACE:  OK.TANDEN: With the attorney general --WALLACE:  Can we just -- can we stick to the subject?TANDEN: I'm happy to, but I just -- I would love --WALLACE: Well, no. OK, but I hear --TANDEN: I -- I -- just, there's not a lot of coverage --WALLACE:  All right, I'm just going to just go ahead with my --TANDEN: There's not a lot of coverage on Fox.WALLACE:  I -- I -- I just want to --TANDEN: I would love to get some coverage for that as well.WALLACE:  OK. Well, it has gotten covered. But in addition --TANDEN: Actually, not a lot of coverage.WALLACE:  In March of 2015, in her news conference at the United Nations, here's how Clinton explained using a private e-mail system.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I opted for convenience to use my personal e-mail account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal e-mails, instead of two.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  But, Neera, the FBI says she didn't use one e-mail device. She didn't use two e-mail devises. She used 15 Blackberries.TANDEN: OK, but --WALLACE:  And -- if, again, if I may just finish the question, and the FBI was unable to recover 13 of those 15.TANDEN: This is a great point. They were always one Blackberry at a time. She didn't use 15 at a time. I go through -- I know it's ridiculous. I've gone through my fair number of Blackberries. But it's not that she had 15 Blackberries at a time. I think this is an important part of reading through this investigation.WALLACE:  OK.TANDEN: You'll see that that's the reality.WALLACE:  All right.George, what do you make of the FBI interview and what effect do you think it will have on the campaign?WILL: Well, there are two kinds of scandals that are ruinous for a candidate. One is one that reinforces a negative narrative about the candidate, and the other is it subverts a positive narrative. This amazing e-mail scandal does both. That is, it re-enforces the idea that the Clintons are entitled and shady and indifferent to the distinction between law and not law, and it subverts the idea that she's a seasoned, experienced government official who said -- looked at the ""c"" marking and said, gee, what could that mean? Could it mean classified? She had no idea evidently.Clearly they -- she or people acting on her behalf destroyed materials that were under subpoena from a congressional committee just as the IRS did with Lois Lerner. So this is a very familiar matter. Now, does this matter? How many people are at this point undecided? I maintain still the belief that most Americans give more due diligence to the selection of a car than a presidential candidate. And I'm not sure that details of this granularity matter.WALLACE:  All right. We -- we're almost out of time and I want to bring Anne in because on this question of whether or not it matters, the race is clearly tightening. I want to put up some numbers. On August 9th, in the Real Clear Politics average of polls Clinton was leading Trump by more than seven points. Now that lead is down to three. As somebody covering the Clinton campaign, do they think that the revelations -- the continued series of revelations about the e-mails and the relationship with the Clinton Foundation, that it's hurting her?GEARAN: Clearly it is hurting her. I mean the -- the Clinton campaign would like to finally put the entire e-mail episode in -- in the past and -- and move on from it. And every couple of weeks or something happens that -- that doesn't allow them to do so. That -- I will say, however, they've always factored in the -- the race would probably be within five points at the end. So if we're at a more or less -- if we're at stasis now, they'll take it.WALLACE:  All right. And I will for -- on your behalf, Neera, say that you file a strong dissent on all of this.Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.TANDEN: Yes (pH).WALLACE:  Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week."" Maryland's governor takes us inside his battle against cancer.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  A look outside the beltway at the Maryland State House in Annapolis.Finally today, the inside story of Maryland Governor Larry Hogan's battle against cancer. Last November, Hogan sat down with us to talk about his illness and his recovery. Here's a special ""Power Player of the Week.""(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)GOV. LARRY HOGAN, R-MARYLAND: I kind of knew that being governor of Maryland as a Republican was going to be a tough job, but I was going to face all kinds of challenges, but I didn't realize cancer was going to be one of them.WALLACE (voice-over): Larry Hogan had been governor just five months last year when he noticed a lump in his neck. He'll never forget the diagnosis from his doctors.HOGAN: We've got some bad news to tell you. You know, you've got 50 or 60 tumors throughout your whole body, from your neck to your groin. You've got very advanced cancer that's spread all over.WALLACE (on camera): When they say that to you --HOGAN: Yes.WALLACE:  Fifty, 60 tumors --HOGAN: Yes.WALLACE:  And advanced cancer, what did you think?HOGAN: I thought about, how am I going to tell my family? You know, what's going to be facing me?WALLACE (voice-over): Three days later, Hogan told the public.HOGAN: I was diagnosed with cancer.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready for the poison?HOGAN: Yes, we're ready for it.WALLACE:  The governor and his doctors decided to be just as aggressive as his cancer. Six rounds of chemotherapy, where each time he would check into the hospital for five days of round the clock treatment.HOGAN: Yes, I didn't sleep for five days because they give you a huge amount of steroids to combat the chemo. So you're wired and you're wide awake.WALLACE:  Hogan worked the cancer ward like a politician.HOGAN: Can I come in and say hi?WALLACE:  Talking to other patients, even though his immune system was weakened by the drugs.HOGAN: You did such an excellent job beating cancer, that you need one of these.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you.HOGAN: I wasn't supposed to, but I was hugging people and shaking their hands and taking pictures with them, and it inspired me.WALLACE:  But, as the chemo built up in his body, the side effects got much worse.HOGAN: I lost all my hair. I had a full head of white hair. And -- and I lost my eyebrows and my eyelashes. My hands and feet started to lose feeling and has nerve damage.WALLACE:  He also suffered from exhaustion. But he kept doing his job.HOGAN: We had meetings in the conference room in the hospital. We had meetings in my -- in my hospital room with senior staff.WALLACE:  As Hogan started recovering, doctors let him go out more. Like to a Baltimore Orioles game, where he found a way to engage in a favorite pastime.HOGAN: I shook 500 hands or so at the Orioles games for the first time. I was so excited because I had a batting glove on.Now I'm putting 12 hour days in, instead of, you know, just coming in for a few hours.WALLACE (on camera): Doctors say to you, slow down a little bit?HOGAN: They keep trying to tell me that, but I don't listen very well.WALLACE (voice-over): Hogan is back in the state house doing what he used to do, but there have been some changes.WALLACE (on camera): What's the biggest thing you learned about yourself?HOGAN: There was a few emotional times, like you pointed out, in my press conference, and I teared up a few times when I was with kids. But I'm also pretty tough.WALLACE (voice-over): He's also found a new mission, as an advocate for cancer research and treatment.HOGAN: Hopefully I'll be done with this soon as far as my own personal fight, but I'm not going to be done with the cause.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  Hogan is in a different fight this week. He ordered Maryland public schools to extend summer vacation until after Labor Day starting next year. School officials and some politicians say that should be left to local school boards.And that's it for today. Have a great holiday weekend.

"This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" June 7, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, the general election is set.  Barring any dramatic developments in the campaign unlike any we have ever seen before, businessman Donald Trump will square off against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton this fall in what can only be described as a ground breaking and historic contest.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly, reporting live tonight, yes --  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)From San Diego, California.(LAUGHTER)One of the six states holding elections today. At any moment, we expect Donald Trump to take the lectern at the Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor in New York to discuss his campaign. As soon as he begins speaking, we will bring it to you live.But first, here's a look at how the candidates have fared thus far. At this hour, we have a few results for you. The polls closed first in New Jersey. And right now, Fox News can project as expected Donald Trump has won there.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)On the Democratic side -- yes, you know, nobody else is running against him so, I mean, there wasn't a lot of drama. On the Democratic side, and hold on, Fox News can now project that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will win New Jersey's Democratic presidential primary. Yes, beating Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders based on the early vote return. So, that's big. Hillary Clinton has won New Jersey. And we are projecting, as we mentioned at the top of the show, she has now become the first woman in history to top the ticket of a major political party. And that's the story.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton's victory is based in part on the support of super delegates or as I like to call them, super delegates.(LAUGHTER)So, it remains to be seen whether Bernie Sanders will continue to fight her until the convention. So far, all signs are yes. We'll continue to watch the remaining races tonight in New Mexico, South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana and California we will bring you those results as we get them.In the meantime, we have a huge show for you tonight, complete with expert analysis. Brit Hume joins us. Chris Stirewalt is with me here in San Diego.Plus, Frank Luntz and his focus group are here with me right now. And we've so many other surprises that in store for you.But as we await Donald Trump, we begin our coverage with our chief political correspondent campaign Carl Cameron who is reporting from Briarcliff Manor, New York. Carl?CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Megyn. And we're expecting to see Mr. Trump come out in just a matter of moments. And now the question is, can Donald Trump really make the pivot to the general election and has he resolved his issues with the Republicans? He's the uncontested Republican nominee. It's a clear win. Hillary Clinton becomes the first ever female nominee for the Democratic Party. But for the last week and a half, Donald Trump has been in roiled in a controversy of his own making.In his defense of himself given the Trump University case and criticism of the judge who has been overseeing that. Today, Donald Trump issued a statement essentially relitigating his side, suggesting that he's not been treated fairly by the judge but saying he's not going to talk about it anymore. We know that his speech tonight which does include a teleprompter is a couple of pages long which means it's likely to be short unless he ad- libs. This was billed as an opportunity for the press to take questions.  There have been a couple of these incidents on election nights where he's offered and give the press questions, and then never given us the chance when we actually got here.And there are a number of questions to be asked tonight. Most of them come from his fellow Republicans. Mitch McConnell today, the Senate Majority Leader, said that it was time for Donald Trump to apologize to the judge in that Trump university case. Paul Ryan suggested that there are still a lot of questions about whether or not Donald Trump has the proper temperament.  And a number of senators today have begun to withdraw their support.And specifically, Mark Kerr (ph), one of the most vulnerable Republican senators up for re-election this year, has essentially reversed his endorsement and says he simply can't endorse Donald Trump. That is the setting for the speech tonight when Donald Trump no longer contested and no more primaries has to make the pivot to Hillary Clinton. It's going to be a tremendous night. We were told just a moment ago we could hear the voice of God saying everybody please take your seats which means that Donald Trump is still a couple minutes away from here.This, again, another one of his golf properties, the National Golf Club here in Westchester. And he's used these facilities quite a bit. So, we'll see how he uses them tonight. The last time we were able to ask questions, we the media, he really trashed the press, said we were unfair.  And the conference call yesterday, suggested that perhaps we were the ones who were acting as racists. Lots of questions. We'll see if we get answers -- Megyn.KELLY: Carl, good to see you.Joining me now, Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume. Brit, great to see you. And so, as we await Donald Trump and his remarks tonight, it appears we now have the general election contest set. Although Bernie Sanders is not going quietly. Your thoughts?BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, first thing, it is obviously an historic milestone for Senator Secretary Clinton. But it lacks the drama that it might have had, had it been a closer race, had she not comes, you know, been the front-runner eight years ago, and had she not had this terrible struggle which continues to this day with Bernie Sanders.  Nonetheless, I think if you look at the Electorate Map and the polling at the moment, she's well positioned to win this election.Donald Trump has ground to make up. And I think it's pretty widely agreed among people you have been involved in national campaigns, do you have to run a disciplined and targeted campaign, with a disciplined candidate to win? That was the hall mark for example of Barack Obama's campaign in 2008. He was very disciplined. Lately, the escapades that Donald Trump has been involved in suggested that discipline has not yet come his way.  So, it will be interesting to see if he comes out and reads his carefully prepared statements tonight, if he's on message, as some fellow Republicans are urging him to be, we'll make it a sense on whether he's about to make a big pivot here. And it looks like he's coming by now.  KELLY: And let me stand you by, Brit. We'll go back to you after the Trump statement. Let's take a listen to Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.(DONALD TRUMP SPEECH)KELLY: A fired-up Donald Trump. A little less fired up than normal perhaps. He's a little bit more controlled. Using the teleprompter, which is something we almost never see him do staying on message. Some of the reactions on Twitter, suggested this is the more reined in Donald Trump that people like Senator Mitch McConnell have wanted to see. Perhaps some people into or around his campaign did not want to see because their motto has been, let Trump be Trump. But perhaps this is Donald Trump too.The more presidential version that he told us he is more than capable of being. You know, when he announced his candidacy a year ago, no one thought he had any chance. He was at single digits in the poll. And here he stands tonight, the presumptive Republican nominee, a very different- sounding man. At least tonight.Back with us now, our Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume. Brit, what do you make of the speech?HUME: Well, it was strikingly different from the meandering things he's been saying in recent days. Look, you can argue all you want about whether his promises are plausible or whether he can sustain them and defend them in a general election campaign. But these were the themes that got him nominated. That's what we heard tonight. On issue after issue after issue. And there's a lot in this for a lot of people.And it's a message that will appeal to not just the segment of the Republican electorate that nominated him, but to a larger slice of the electorate as he tries to build a constituency large enough to elect him in the general. And that's what his business is about. And that's what this speech seemed tailored to do. And he delivered it effectively. Not at great length. And shorn of all the stuff that's caused him a lot of gratuitous distractions, destructions in recent days.KELLY: Just before we went to Donald Trump, you were suggesting the Electorate Map would suggests that Donald Trump is going to lose this general election. I don't mean to suggest you have a case of whiplash, but did you change your mind in those four minutes?HUME: No, no. He has any Republican nominee, if you look at the Electorate Map, faces a formidable challenge and begins inevitably as an underdog. If you look at the states that Democrats have won in cycle after cycle, and those Republicans have won, Democrats have won many more of them. They have a built-in Electoral College advantage because of the way the population is distributed in our country in the way the Electoral College snaps up.So it's tough for any Republican. But it's impossible for Republican to win if he doesn't have or she doesn't have as the case may be a message that appeals to a broad cross-section of the electorate. And that's what the challenge that Donald Trump has faced and the opportunity that he's faced since he clinched the nomination some weeks ago. Begin to build out his appeal. So that he has a chance of winning enough states to win the election.But we're going to be looking, Megyn, when we come this fall, we're going to be looking at a lot of the same states, we always are, when it comes to the end, Florida, Ohio and the rest of them, the swing states, and you know, he has a challenge. He's got to find a way to win those states where, you know, Democrats may outnumber Republicans, and that's the challenge.KELLY: And you heard him tonight trying to speak out to not only the people he didn't win over during the Republican primary process but to Bernie Sanders voters who he believes and has said all along he thinks he can win with.Brit, it's great to see you.HUME: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: So, while Donald Trump was speaking, the Fox News decision desk projected that Donald Trump will win two more primaries tonight, one in New Mexico, one in South Dakota. In both states he was the only major candidate -- be happy about it, there you go.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)So it's a bit -- I mean, it's secure. The nomination is all but secure.  Doesn't become official until July.Joining me now with reaction, David Wohl, he's a Trump supporter and attorney. And Stuart Stevens who is a former campaign strategist to Mitt Romney 2012. And founding partner of Strategic Partners & Media.All right. Our guests join us. All right, good to see you both. Let me start with you Stu, as a Trump critic, that was a different sounding Trump.  Could you get behind that Trump?STUART STEVENS, FORMER ROMNEY CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST: Well, I think it should be a rule that all politicians read from teleprompters because it gives them a chance to formulate thoughts. Look, I thought it was a good speech.  It starts to lay the groundwork of addition. And that ultimately is what particularly a Republican is forced with. He's got to get people who aren't normally with you to convince them to come out and vote for you.  Democrats normally start with 240 electoral votes. Republicans start with more like 116. The question here --KELLY: Crazy when you think about that. To say that again, the Democrats normally start with 242 Electoral Votes in the bag. Like states you know they're going to win. That they always win. And the Republicans normally start with how many?STEVENS: Hundred and thirteen.KELLY: Wow!STEVENS: Two forty three is better. That's easier.KELLY: Yes. Yes.STEVENS: And I think -- I was interested to hear him speak about. Because people don't appreciate the difficulty of putting together a winning coalition in a presidential year which is a very different coalition --KELLY: So, you know, the response to that David, which is those people and history has never seen anything like the Trump --DAVID WOHL, TRUMP SUPPORTER: No, they haven't. And you want presidential, Megyn? I give you presidential. Donald Trump has this amazing way of taking negative energy and negative press and turning it into rocket fuel for his campaign and that's exactly what he did. I mean, there was an amazing speech. And on top of everything else, he teased Monday where he's going to have this huge disclosure about Hillary Clinton and I suspect -- I've got some ideas what it may be. But I'm going to leave it up to him that it will be huge.And it's got to be something but the Clinton Foundation and the donations and possibly the e-mail scandal. But this man has a way of taking scandal, a min-scandal and flipping it into such positive press. I mean, in two weeks, three weeks, no one will know who Judge Curiel is. Everybody will have forgotten about the Trump University situation and will leave it to what it is, which is a relatively minor civil suit.  KELLY: Yes. If you look back at the primary process, Stuart, he's exactly right, that's exactly what did happen, but it was typically because Trump would generate a new controversy that would then dwarf the old controversy and everybody would just move on because it's like, okay, it's the flavor of the day.  STEVENS: The thing about -- presidency, it's different than any other office. You really are investing in what you think is the soul of the nation and what you think is the leadership of the nation. This is something what Ronald Reagan really could bring together. And I think that more than any candidate that we've seen in a long time, Donald Trump is the message. So the challenge for Donald Trump is going to be able to sustain a positive, not angry, inviting open message if he goes out to the country.  It's very hard to do.You know, this isn't even the pregame warm-up for a campaign. I mean, this thing will be decided post-conventions. But he's got to sustain this. And really mean it from his heart and not just reading from a teleprompter.  That's true of any candidate but I think it's a particular challenge for him because two days ago, he was talking about how if you're born in Indiana, you're not really American.  KELLY: Yes, how this judge's Hispanic heritage made them unfit --WOHL: Megyn, he circled back on that one. And I think that, you know, it was the judge's affiliate much more than the judge's --KELLY: That's not what he said.  WOHL: Well, he didn't say it earlier, Megyn, I can tell you something, Donald Trump has --KELLY: I can tell you, we have it on tape, five times, saying the fact that the guy had Hispanic parents.   WOHL: Donald Trump has a way of saying things and having a slightly different meaning than he intended. Now, I can tell you right now, I've spoken to him and if Ronald Reagan was called the great communicator, I can tell you right now that you just witnessed it. Donald Trump is also a great communicator in a different way.Sometimes it can seem a little rough around the edges but the power of his words. And you just saw him reading off a prompter and it's so natural, by the way, that he could be a news anchor nut he's amazingly talented at communicating the ideas with such force and power that you believe. When he says he's going to do things, I mean you sit there and say, wow, I think he can really do it and that's just how...KELLY: Last question to you Stu. He said...STEVENS: I think David should run.KELLY: He's got my vote. Stu, some say I'm too much of a fighter. My preference is peace. My goal is to bring people together. Can he sell that, given the history of his comments?STEVENS: I think it's very difficult to do. If Trump -- Trump is someone whose instinct is to divide people, not bring people together. That's why he's got to sustain this(AUDIENCE BOOING)KELLY: Sorry we're having hecklers in the audience. It's the instant feedback. They love you. They mock because they love.STEVENS: He has to sustain this and that's going to be the challenge for him.KELLY: Great to see you both. Thank you guys.WOHL: Thank you.KELLY: So, you heard Brit Hume talking about the general election and we have put together a fierce focus group of bipartisan voters who will help decide this very election. When we come back, you will hear them take on the fight between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in a must see preview of the battle ahead, next.(Applause)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back everybody. We are live in beautiful San Diego, California where they are voting today, and now we have the focus group of voters with us here. Democrats and Republicans who are prepared to vote in this general election contest, which we're looking at next. You can feel and hear the enthusiasm. Chris Stirewalt is on his way over, I will talk to him too but I want to get to the focus group.All right first of all, so for the Republicans in the group, raise your hand if you are on the fence about Trump prior to tonight. And did his speech do anything to assuage your concerns?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not especially, no. I am kind of a Never Trump Republican. I voted for Ted Cruz today. I'm proud of it. Yeah, Donald Trump, you know, I just am not so persuaded by him, you know. He's been a democrat most of his life. You know, a lot of his positions, he's swaying now and going back toward the liberal side of things and his speech...KELLY: But what about you -- the people who feel as Dylan does, the Republicans, would you vote for Hillary Clinton? I mean, that's what the Republicans say. Go ahead.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Gary Johnson. I'm libertarian. I've never -- I voted Republican my entire life and this year, I'm giving the other guy a chance.KELLY: All right, anybody -- any other disaffected Republicans in here who don't love Trump but are going to vote for him anyway because they don't want to vote for Hillary Clinton? You, go ahead.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Absolutely. He's going to bring I think jobs back to America. Literally the United States government has sent manufacturing, customer service and tech support abroad while they've started giving American jobs to foreign workers. Absolutely not. They've created a labor crisis for the United States.KELLY: The Democrats who are out here, is there -- because he was trying to appeal to Bernie Sanders supporters. Are there any Bernie Sanders supporters here? How about you? Would you consider Trump now that Bernie seems to be on the swan song?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Never Trump.KELLY: Never Trump, okay. So you go for Hillary?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Actually, I'm not even sure I would vote for Hillary but I know I would not vote for Trump.KELLY: You know but Donald Trump is not stopping at the Republicans. He's trying to rein in some of the Democrats too. He thinks this is how he's going to build the winning coalition. He doesn't need the sort of never Trump Republicans. He can get enough Democrats over to him that he can win this election. Go ahead, you sir.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think that Brit said it earlier. I think you'd really have to address the disaffected, you know, voters -- the 100 million people that don't vote and I think the candidate on either side that takes control of that particular sector because this is a nuclear election. It's going to be nuclear. This thing is going to get big. It's going to be bigger than anything that we've ever seen. But I think the motivation behind that is going to be the candidate that can actually talk to the people and make them come out and vote. That's the winner.KELLY: Go ahead, Corey.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a horribly dispirited election. None of the above voters are probably going to decide this election. The swing state, it's going to come down to people who don't want Trump or don't want Hillary but can't make a decision between the two of them and have to pick one for their side or they try but whatever and it's hard to stay tuned in on.KELLY: Let's hear from the Trump supporters because I know there are Trump supporters out here thinking these folks don't get it...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, what's going to cause Trump to win this election as those Bernie supporters are going to come over to him, because you know what, Hillary Clinton is the absolute worst decision for this country, okay. She has proved herself to be absolutely wrong. She's big government. She's not what this country needs. We need to go back to the constitution and it's all about economics. Economics is what's going to run this election cycle and country.KELLY: Go ahead ma'am. Okay, let her respond. Go ahead.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I would say yes she has proven herself and Donald Trump hasn't proven anything, okay. It's like a horse race. My dad was a racer...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She has proven she cannot lead...UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What would you rather vote on, the horse that hasn't ridden? The horse that can't even get into the gate because he doesn't respect a single soul, he can't get a rider on his back to even win the race. At least Hillary has already won two races as far as being a senator and being our Secretary of State and it's a triple crown.KELLY: They want to get in on that.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Here's the difference -- here's the difference though...UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The first woman...KELLY: You ma'am, in the front.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, our first woman president, yes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hillary has the experience and she can take us where we need to go. Donald has done absolutely nothing but alienate everybody. Women, minorities. He just -- No, absolutely not.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She's failed every time -- everything she's tried. She failed Namibia (ph). She sold them down the river (ph). She failed in Egypt. They're a mess (inaudible). The whole administration is -- Saudi Arabia, we need them as partners and then they know we got this guy, Donald Trump.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump doesn't make it better.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, he doesn't, he doesn't, he's already offending them.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: ... by saying that we are a nation of immigrants.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He never once addressed the immigrant situation in this country.KELLY: Illegal immigration?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, I'm sorry, in the words of Eva Longoria, and I am Eva, she said the border crossed us. We did not cross the border. This country is made of people from every country in the world and when you choose to purposely alienate hundreds of thousands of millions of people from all ethnicities, all religious backgrounds...KELLY: Go ahead Amanda.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They broke the law coming over. I grew up in San Diego. This is what we got to deal about our whole entire life.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm sorry, and who is the person who cuts your lawn and takes care of your children and washes your dishes and scrubs your toilets.(Crosstalk)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah, I'm worried about the ones who wants to go away with financial aid from students like me though.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I mean, that is the focus. I'm sorry Dillon (ph). They do not take away your financial aids. --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They're not flying American flags. They're flying Mexico flags...(Crosstalk)KELLY: Let me just ask you, you're a Trump supporter?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Irish flag in St. Patrick's day.KELLY: What did you think about the comments about the judge which he didn't mention today but have been on the news?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm learning about it. I actually went to the Trump rally where he was produced (ph) speaking about it and I don't know much about it.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: ... proud of their heritage...UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I believe that there may be some bias with the judge with regards in...UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Some bias? No.(Crosstalk)KELLY: Go ahead, Corey.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What Donald Trump said is unacceptable and un-American to say that somebody's ethnicity can affect their own judgment is completely un-American. We are a nation of immigrants. We're in San Diego, California.(Crosstalk)KELLY: Go ahead, ma'am.(Crosstalk)KELLY: Let her go.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: ...to my family and to my daughter. When I look at Trump's website, the number one issue is his school, check it out. That's his number one issue. His number one policy is pay for the wall. I want someone who cares about education, economy, healthcare. I want someone who has true policies and true sense, if you check out the difference, if you want substance. I don't want somebody who goes to bed thinking about himself and who bothered him that day. I want someone going to bed and thinking about our future, our children.KELLY: Go ahead.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I respect what she's saying, but the reality is all the things you just mentioned, healthcare and all the things that continue to be a problem in this country, we don't really address. The media has their own way of saying things and I think the American people are fed up. I think they...KELLY: So who do you like? Who do you like?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Pardon me?KELLY: You like Trump?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Pardon me?KELLY: Who are you voting for?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm a Trump supporter.KELLY: Okay.(Cheering)(Laughter)KELLY: You're convincing me or yourself? All right this is great, you guys, stand by.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How do you feel about how he treated you when you first had the first interview?KELLY: It's not about me, it's not about me. My feelings are irrelevant. The only questions -- the only feelings that are relevant are yours.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I know.KELLY: All right, I got to go. Standby.(Crosstalk)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: ...unemployment rate in Chicago, that's the problem.KELLY: Standby, standby, standby, because there's much, much more. I'm delighted to tell you. So, you want more of this, right? And I think these guys want to get in on it, right? I think they're having focus group envy. Don't go away because we have much more coming up including Frank Luntz who wants a shot at these folks.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)   KELLY: Breaking tonight, Hillary Clinton officially clinches the number of delegates to make her the presumptive Democratic nominee, but her challenger Bernie Sanders is not backing down quietly. His campaign says you should not expect to see the Senator drop out any time soon. Joining me now, Bernie Sanders supporter Nomiki Konst and Hillary Clinton supporter Congresswoman Linda Sanchez, great to see you both. Congresswoman let me start with you. It is history. This is history. First time a woman has secured the nomination of a major party.LINDA SANCHEZ, CALIFORNIA CONGRESSWOMAN: Yes, absolutely historic and long overdue.KELLY: What factor does that play in her securing the actual win in November?SANCHEZ: I don't really think that it has much to do with that. I think that she stands on her own merits. If you look at her track record of accomplishments, of working on the issues that working families care most about. She's the most qualified candidate.KELLY: What's she going to do to dispatch Bernie Sanders who seems to be holding on?SANCHEZ: Well, look, I give Bernie Sanders a lot of credit. He has excited first-time participants into the system, younger voters. That's healthy for democracy and I think that's, you know, much to his credit. He's talking about issues that resonate with a whole generation.KELLY: But he's talking on and on and on and on, she wants to get rid of him?SANCHEZ: No, I understand that.KELLY: He's talking too much she thinks.SANCHEZ: Yes. I would just say this, look, there is a finite amount of time between now and the November election and the quicker that democrats can coalesce and unify behind our nominee, I think the better for us in terms of the outcome of the national election (ph).KELLY: But you know, Bernie and his supporters and his campaign team has said forget that, we are still in this thing and, you know, we're going to go all the way to a contested convention.NOMIKI KONST, BERNIE SANDERS SUPPORTER: Absolutely, and that's because the rules, as you will notice, the DNC has not come out and declared that Hillary Clinton is the presumptive nominee because the rules are that the candidate needs to reach 2,383 pledge delegates.KELLY: Right, and she's got super delegates mixed in.KONST: Exactly, and a lot of them had been chosen yet, they're not found (ph). They're not so super in my opinion because some are lobbyists, some are answering (ph) to voters. Their voters have said that they want to vote -- they want Bernie Sanders...KELLY: He says he's going to coonvert some over to his side, the Super Delegates, and so far he hasn't gotten any, in fact...KONST: We got one today (ph).(Crosstalk)KELLY: ...and that person went towards her.KONST: Well, today there was one in California...KELLY: ...so he's got one.KONST: Well, regardless of that, a contested convention, but that's not what democracy is about. Democracy should not be about a super delegate and equal 10,000 votes...KELLY: It's your party.KONST: ...to this election. Exactly, so we're going to go to the convention, have a contested convention, try to push for change of rules, bring democracy back -- 43 percent of the country right now is independent and Bernie Sanders has brought in independents for progressive leaning into the party. The Democrats...KELLY: But what about -- what about Congresswoman Sanchez's argument which is the party needs to unite because otherwise you're just going to see Hillary, the presumptive nominee, at least, struggle in her contest against Trump.KONST: So, the issue here is the DNC has one job right now and that's to elect the most electable candidate. Bernie Sanders is the only one beating Trump. He beats Trump...KELLY: His polls are still better than her versus Trump.SANCHEZ: Sure, but look at the fact that if you just look at the pledged delegates, too, Hillary Clinton is leading so...KONST: Maybe not after California.SANCHEZ: ...this attempt to sort of sway super delegates would undermine the outcome of popular voting which clearly favors Hillary Clinton and I'm just going to say this, there's too much at stake in the November election because I think Bernie Sanders at the end of the end of the day has more in common with the values of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party than they do with Donald Trump and I don't take anything for granted. Donald Trump is a dangerous man. He's a divisive man and I think in order to have our best to beat him, we need to unite and we need to be rowing in the same direction.KONST: And we should unite by the kind of candidate that can win, and that's Bernie Sanders. We're going to a contested convention.SANCHEZ: I disagree.KELLY: Great to see you both. Thanks for being here.KONST: Thank you for having us.KELLY: Well, a fired up focus group and Chris Stirewalt are next. Don't go away.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back everybody. Here we are in San Diego, California with a fired up group of focus people and Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News digital politics editor. Chris, first of all, what did you make of the Trump speech tonight, the pivot speech as they're now talking about it?STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Too much Republican, not enough Trump. Trump needs to be more Trump.KELLY: What do you mean?STIREWALT: So, the Republican Party --KELLY: He can't win.STIREWALT: No, no, he can't win. He did win. He won faster than Mitt Romney, he did it in 13 weeks.KELLY: But when he does the sort of Trump, Judge Curiel stuff, he gets pummeled. Be more presidential, that is more presidential and you say be more Trump.STIREWALT: I am 100 percent in favor of the idea that what Donald Trump needs to be is true to the person who God made him to be. And that person is loud, that person is controversial, that person angers Republicans. He needs to stay in that space and keep doing it because as soon as he acts like Reince Priebus wants him to act, boom.KELLY: You guys agree with that?UNIDENTIFIED MALE/FEMALE: Yeah.KELLY: Oh, wow. Look at that.STIREWALT: Look at how good looking and smart these people are. Obviously they agree with me. Obviously.KELLY: So raise your hand if you believe in the let Trump be Trump? I know you're a democrat. He doesn't mean it in the same way the rest of you mean it.(Laughter)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump.KELLY: Yes, go ahead. You in the front.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Part of the establishment of the Republican Party does not want to change what they are because they're really RINOs. They're not really conservatives.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Republican Party needs to be shaken up and Trump is the person to do it. They have failed miserably in power. As somebody who started out voting as a Republican, I have been so utterly disappointed in this party recently. Trump brings some needed change and if he's arrogant and he's obnoxious, great. Far better than a criminal.KELLY: Other than -- better than a criminal. They like the wrecking ball effect. Go ahead.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Everything you said is true, but there's also a theory out there that says well, he's going to be so in over his head and he's already going to the party to get help. That it's going to be an establishment Republican Party, anyway, or an establishment...KELLY: You really think Trump will wind up bowing to the establishment?UNIDENTIFIED MALE/UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think -- I think...STIREWALT: Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't do the dance. It's either the Trump, the whole Trump and nothing but the Trump. There's no other Trump. There's not like in other setting when you say I'm only Trump until about 1:00.KELLY: It's like this one goes to the...STIREWALT: I'm only Trump until about 1:00.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If Trump changes who he is, he's not going to win this and this country is going to continue to go down in flames. We need somebody to come in and stir the pot. It's unfortunate, but it's true. Somebody needs to fix this. He will get the people in the middle, absolutely.(Crosstalk)KELLY: Wait, wait. Led Sidney make her point then you, sir. Go ahead.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm a conservative through and through and I can't stand any of these politicians. I don't care if they're Republicans or Democrats in Washington or in California.KELLY: You like -- you like...UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm for Trump. It's the only time I'm not going to plug my nose when I vote for president.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So you like him.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's a conservative, he's a free enterpriser.(Crosstalk)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She loves America.KELLY: You in the back, sir, I promised you next. Go ahead.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump is going to defend (ph)... Yeah, I'm an independent and there's no way in the world if Donald Trump keeps up with the egotistical buffoonery, he's going to pull me towards him. He alienates me which millions of Americans...STIREWALT: Dale (ph) are we counting out egotistical buffoonery in politics now?(Laughter)STIREWALT: Is egotistical buffoonery out in politics now?KELLY: So judgmental.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm sorry.KELLY: For everybody here, clap if you think Donald Trump is going to win the election.(Applause)KELLY: Okay. And now -- and now clap if you think it's going to be Hillary.(Applause)KELLY: OK, I don't know how exactly weighted the groups are, just to be full disclosure there. Thank you all so much for watching. Thank you, San Diego. Bret and I will be back at 11:00 for special coverage. Good night.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

The governor of the great state is here. Sheriff Clarke is here tonight.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HANNITY: But before we get started, on a serious note, this summer, we have seen a wave of violence inspired by radical Islamists both here at home and abroad. Let's get a quick reminder. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, my God. They're all shooting back and forth.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tonight, our community witnessed or experienced a very horrific crime. Many lives were lost.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Now a terrorist outside Paris stabbing and killing two French police officers, and he streamed the murders live on Facebook.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One of the three blew himself up outside. The other two blew themselves up inside after opening fire and engaging in a firefight with police.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That all too familiar news of another terror attack striking at the very heart of Europe. Suddenly, this truck accelerated and plowed into the people lining the beach, watching the fireworks.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is no spotlight on this war. This is the reality. The enemy has a plan.

Another Syrian refugee killed a co-worker and injured two others in a knife attack in the town of Reutlingen (ph).UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: ... Syrian suicide bomber who pledged his allegiance to ISIS blowing himself up and injuring 15 people.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They attacked and cut the throat of the priest. They then attacked one of the elderly parishioners. They then left the church, and it was as they were emerging from the church that they called, Allah-u akbar.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: And joining us now here in Milwaukee, 2016 Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is with us.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HANNITY: You know, I watched very closely your speech yesterday, and you were very, very frank, and you talked about this being literally this death -- ideology of death must be stopped. You talked about San Bernardino.  You talked about Orlando. You talked about Chattanooga. You talked about Paris, France, Germany, Belgium, all of this terror -- that's just from this summer. Is this a war or clash of civilizations?DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Absolutely, it is. And we're not taking it -- we're not taking it to them, and we have to take it to them.  You know, I didn't want to go into Iraq. Said -- and I was a civilian, so I would say not too many people cared what I wanted to do. But that was a terrible mistake. Our terrible mistake number two was getting out the way we got out.President Obama, Hillary Clinton -- the way they got out was absolutely insane. It'll be talked about for many, many years, and it really led to the formation of ISIS.We have problems in this country. We're letting thousands and thousands of people come into our country. We have no idea who they are, where they come from. There's no paperwork. Nobody knows what they're doing. And they're coming in by the thousands, and Hillary Clinton, who has announced recently that she wants to allow 550 percent more coming into our country from Syria, from the migration, than Obama's allowing to come in.HANNITY: You said yesterday anyone who cannot name our enemy is not fit to lead this country. Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, the oppression, the violence of radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our president.TRUMP: Well, he actually had a speech and...(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: It's actually -- it's not only true, it's sad because, I mean, how obvious can it be? You look at what's going on, World Trade Center, you look at San Bernardino, you look at so many different things. You look at Nice just recently.I have friends that won't go to France anymore. They love France. They love the city of lights, Paris. They love -- they love Paris. And I say to them, How was France this summer? Oh, we don't go there anymore.  France is no longer France.And we're going to do the same thing to our country, Sean. So we can't allow it to happen. And I have as big a heart as anybody. We take care of people. We'll build safe zones over in Syria. We'll do something. We have to have the Gulf states pay for it because the Gulf states, they may nothing but money...HANNITY: In other words, the refugees -- you'll help them.TRUMP: A hundred percent.HANNITY: You'll give food, water...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: ... baby formula, but it'll be a safe zone that's protected and not bring them here.TRUMP: A hundred percent, a hundred percent. And we have to. We have to.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HANNITY: Let me ask you this. I know it was being controversial when you said that the founder of ISIS is Obama and the co-founder is Hillary. But yesterday...(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HANNITY: Yesterday, you went into a lot of detail. You and I -- actually, I remember debating you because I did support Iraq, but I didn't support leaving early without finishing the job. We had so many Americans bleed and die and risk their lives for Mosul, Baghdad, Fallujah, Ramadi and Tikrit. They won those cities.TRUMP: Right.HANNITY: And you talked about even though you were opposed to it, you were opposed to leaving.TRUMP: Well, look, look, I said one thing right from the beginning. I wanted to get out. We should have never been there, and I wanted to get out. And I've been against it ever since. I mean, you can look back to 2004, 2003. In fact, on Neil Cavuto's show, before the war started, I said, Let's not do it. We have other things we have to do, including fix our economy, which was a mess, OK, to put it mildly.But the way we got out was ridiculous. But I've been saying something even since I've known you, keep the oil. Have I said that?HANNITY: Yes.TRUMP: Keep the oil.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Keep the oil. And I said, when we went in -- you know, in the old days, to the victor belong the spoils. We -- if we -- I don't call it a victory. It's no victory, but certainly, militarily we wiped them out.  But I said keep the oil and take the money and some of it give to the families of the soldiers who died, give it to the wounded warriors, give it to the people that have been hurt so badly in that war.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And it would be -- by the way, that would be such a small part of the money, and the rest we use to pay ourselves...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: ... life blood of how they fight terror now, funding.TRUMP: Right, so it's -- what I'm saying is, keep the oil. Now, if they would have done that, there would be no ISIS. I said keep the oil. And I think most of the audience has heard me say it 200 times. I mean, every time, practically -- so I wanted to get out, but I wanted to keep the oil.So by nature, that means you're staying in because you're going to have to guard the oil, et cetera, et cetera, but that oil is very prized oil, believe me. We have the same problem in Libya right now. We did the stupid attacks on Libya and we got nothing out of it, and ISIS has taken over the oil, and it's some of the finest oil in the world.HANNITY: You said it's time for new approach, but you're also against sending in ground troops. And this enemy is different from any other enemy. And you mentioned our history of defeating fascism and Nazism and communism and imperial Japan, and you talk all about that. How do you defeat ISIS if you don't have ground troops?TRUMP: So when I was young and went to school, I'd always heard we never lost. This country, we never lost a war, you know, World War I, World War II -- we just didn't lose wars.And since then, I mean, when you think of it, you look at Vietnam, you look at this mess that we're in right now, all of the money spent on this -- I mean, it's so sad, trillions of dollars. I used to say $2 trillion in Iraq, but that was years ago. I mean, I've been saying that for so long.  Nobody even knows what it is.In the meantime, our country is going to hell. Our infrastructure is terrible. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our schools, our hospitals, they're -- we're like a third -- we're becoming like a third world country.  We're spending our money over there.With all of that being said, you have an enemy that wants to do serious harm to us, OK, beyond what anyone has ever seen. This is like medieval times.HANNITY: You know -- you know what I'd like -- one question I'd like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama asked. I've seen the beheading videos.  Have any of you taken the time? It is the embodiment of evil in our time.  I don't know if Hillary or Obama's ever watched it. Have you watched those videos?TRUMP: I chose not to, but you know, we all understood what took place.  And these were great young people. And not only our people, they're doing it to their own people. They're doing it to Christians. If you're a Christian in the Middle East and they have you, it's very likely that's going to happen.The point is, they want to do serious harm. We have to take them out. We have to take them out very, very swiftly, and viciously, if necessary.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HANNITY: But there's no ground troops, though. You know, you did say a couple other things. You said the era of nation building is over and it's going to come to a quick end, and you're saying it'll come to a quick end.  That will mean bombing on a very -- at a very high level. And every time that happens, you know what the media is going to do, is they're going to find the one area where there is collateral damage, which, sadly, happens in every war. We've been a compassionate nation. How do you do it...TRUMP: General Flynn...HANNITY: ... with collateral damage and win?TRUMP: Right. General Flynn and other of the generals -- these are great people. And I ask them all the time, if you were given your head -- because right now, they're fighting a politically correct war. If you were given your head, just you go in and you got to get them out, how long would it take? I'll tell you what. They are telling me they could do the job very, very rapidly.Now, very rapidly is longer than you would like, but they could get the job done and get it done with precision and get it done. We have no choice, Sean. We have no choice. We have to take them out.HANNITY: All right, stay right there. We're just getting things started.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HANNITY: Now, we will have much more as we continue with Donald Trump right after the break.Also tonight, you'll meet victims of radical Islamic terrorist attacks, their family members, as we continue ""Hannity"" from Milwaukee and the Pabst Theater straight ahead.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) he was dead. He was dead on the floor!.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And she said, I saw two sisters and one brother from Poland who were mourning the death of their two other siblings. The youngest was crying, and the other two just didn't know how to react.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) very deep identity of the French people, and that's why it's -- it was really a very big shock for everybody.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I feel guilty about screaming about my leg in pain because I could feel nothing, like the other 49 who weren't so lucky to feel this pain of mine. The guilt of being alive is heavy.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Just a few of the victims of terror. We continue from Milwaukee for the full hour with Donald Trump as we talk about protecting the homeland.And joining us now, we have victims of terror to tell their story. Joining us here, Karen McWatters, her husband, Kevin. And Karen, you lost your leg in the Boston bombing.KAREN MCWATTERS, BOSTON MARATHON BOMBING SURVIVOR: I did.HANNITY: Tell us your story.MCWATTERS: I went to see my husband Kevin run, and we got a nice spot right at the finish line. I was with a dear friend, Crystal (ph), and we were all having a great time. The marathon is always a fun day and lots of celebration and fun.And we were at the site of the first bombing. So when the first bomb went off, we -- that's when I lost my leg. And actually, I didn't lose it right away, but I hurt my leg. And Crystal died there, and then we were awake (ph) to hear the second bombing, and then after that...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: ... close friend.MCWATTERS: She was a close friend, yes.HANNITY: What do you think when you hear -- you heard Mr. Trump's speech.  You hear a president that can't say radical Islamic terror.MCWATTERS: It's really upsetting. I don't think it's helpful. I think if we don't speak honestly and clearly about what's happening that we can't solve the issue. And I think that he is so concerned that Muslims are all going to be targeted or -- I'm assuming he thinks that. But I lost my leg.  I don't blame all Muslims because I lost my leg. I understand the difference between radicalized people and people who are of peace.HANNITY: Donald Trump, who's sitting right here, talked about extreme vetting of people that come from countries that practice sharia, which is the antithesis of our own Constitution. Is that something that you think this country -- what would you like to tell them?TRUMP: Well, we're just allowing people into our country that some are going to be a problem. And we have enough problems in our country right now, and you people are really proof positive. What you've gone through, it's unimaginable.I watched the Boston bombing so many times on television, how somebody could do that, how they got them on tape -- it was genius police work, how they got them to start off with, but you know, how they caught them.But when you walk -- you see them walking along like they haven't got a problem in the world and they're looking to do mass destruction. And when I see that, I want to do something about it. I want to do something about it.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HANNITY: Dorothy Woods (INAUDIBLE) this guy is a very close friend now of mine, and she's become a close friend. This is Kris ""Tanto"" Paronto. He is one of the heroes of Benghazi.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HANNITY: Dorothy's husband, Ty Woods, was also one of the heroes. You remember, Mr. Trump, that they were given a standdown order.TRUMP: Sure.HANNITY: They all risked their careers and they said, We're not standing down when Americans are under fire, while Hillary Clinton was debating...(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HANNITY: ... whether to ask the Libyan government for permission and whether or not they could go in uniform.You lost your husband that day, and your husband went to protect people that he knew were under assault at that compound. And he will tell you and others that I have interviewed that your husband saved a lot of people's lives.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)DOROTHY WOODS, WIDOW OF BENGHAZI VICTIM TY WOODS: He did. Really, I'm here this evening because of Benghazi, and I -- you know, as a victim, there was lack -- under Hillary Clinton and the State Department, there was lack of security planning and decision making up to and during that night.The Obama administration lacked strategic action because they felt like there wasn't enough time to help them. You know, Americans died. My husband died saving American lives. We're at war against Islamic -- you know, radical Islam here and abroad. So you know, we have men and women out there in dangerous places serving our country, and they don't have confidence that we're going to (INAUDIBLE) save them.HANNITY: I want to remind the audience, though, and Kris, you can talk to this, because your husband was a hero. Your husband defied orders, risked his entire career. You did the same thing. You were told to stand down, correct?KRIS ""TANTO"" PARONTO, CHAIRMAN, LEADING FROM THE FRONT: And Ty is a hero.HANNITY: And Ty is a hero.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: That's right.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HANNITY: Here's what we've now learned since. There were 600 separate requests for security that were denied before, while the -- while Great Britain and the Red Cross left.PARONTO: They did.HANNITY: Because things were so bad.PARONTO: (INAUDIBLE) pulling out (INAUDIBLE)HANNITY: And then during the attack, there were multiple requests. This was all being seen in live video. And then afterwards, you were in Germany, you told me that they said this was a spontaneous demonstration.PARONTO: First thing I saw. And I told people, turn on the TV, and I saw Susan Rice and her on TV saying it was due to some video and some protest.  And I'll be honest. I didn't get angry. I turned the TV off, and because of all the things that I've seen over those years of deploying under the Obama administration, I turned it off. I said par for the course, and I went back to bed.HANNITY: Yes.PARONTO: So it was almost like I expected to see them start to cover it up. And then it just steamrolled from there.HANNITY: Unbelievable. What would you like to tell Mr. Trump about what needs to change?PARONTO: You know, I believe in the vetting process. I do. Now, the terrorists -- and I've been deployed for 10 years. The terrorists overseas utilize our strengths, which are compassion and empathy, against us.TRUMP: True.PARONTO: That's what they're doing right now.TRUMP: True.PARONTO: So I do agree that vetting is necessary. I also agree that -- and when you speak of the Muslim community, you're right. Not all Muslims are bad, but the Muslim community in America, they are Americans because they're here -- they need to start speaking out publicly and condemning...(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HANNITY: Let me bring in...PARONTO: So I do believe that.HANNITY: Kimberly Munley -- Kimberly, how many times were you shot at Ft. Hood, which, by the way, was workplace violence, and not terrorism. How many times were you shot?KIMBERLY MUNLEY, FT. HOOD TERROR ATTACK SURVIVOR: Three times.HANNITY: Three times. And also, we have Howard Ray, and you were a survivor of Ft. Hood.HOWARD RAY, FT. HOOD TERROR ATTACK SURVIVOR: Yes, sir.HANNITY: Yes. Tell us your stories. Kimberly?MUNLEY: As you may remember, on November 5th, 2009, there was -- I got -- the call was, Shots fired, multiple injuries, and arriving on scene, engaged the shooter, shot him twice. He still shot me three times.(APPLAUSE)HANNITY: Did you hear him yell, Allah-u akbar?MUNLEY: I did not personally. Where he started the massacre at inside the building. When I engaged him was outside the building. I never spoke a word to him. He never spoke a word to me. After I went down, my weapon malfunctioned from the impact of falling, and he walked up to me and put his gun to my head and pulled his trigger, and his malfunctioned, as well.HANNITY: And you got to get a new -- wow. Wow. Tell us your story.RAY: The day of November 5th, 2009, I'd showed up to the SRP site and -- Soldier Readiness Processing station, and I was actually there for an appointment in a building just adjacent to where the shooting initially took place.I heard the shots ring out. And I was, like, Well, this isn't right. And so I took action to make sure that I got all of my fellow soldiers and co- workers and our group facilitator out of the building. It was quite chaotic.What ended up happening was, a woman ended up freezing out the door on the way out. And I realized this from experience, that she froze up. She was lost. I grabbed her, we run out back. And there was someone there yelled, He's coming around, he's coming around.And so that day, I was in civilian clothes, I reached back for my pistol.  I had a very good opportunity and timing (ph) to take care of the situation, looked down into an empty holster, only to tell the woman, who is now in total tears and crying, as she should, because it's such a terrifying situation, where she -- I said, We got to go, and so we ended up running across the back side of the parking lot.I put myself in front of her. He came around the corner, raised his gun.  And I said, Well, here it is. And ultimately, I ended up unscathed, but I subsequently got her to safety. I was given an award for saving the lives of my colleagues that day.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HANNITY: These are the victims of real life terror that is hurting our homeland, San Bernardino, Orlando, Chattanooga, abroad, France, Germany, Belgium, all of Europe, the impact immigration has on this, vetting refugees -- is it possible?We want to thank our guests for being here. Thank you so much for telling and sharing your stories.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HANNITY: When we come back, we'll talk to Mr. Trump about how to keep the homeland safe straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" We're in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with Donald Trump for the entire hour, and we're talking about protecting the homeland, defeating ISIS, winning this war on terror.These are the real victims. They don't get a -- you know, Boston happens, we move on. Chattanooga happens, we move on. The people in Orlando are still living in the aftermath of what happened at that nightclub.TRUMP: Right. And there'll be more. Look, we can be nice about it. We can say it's never going to happen again. There'll be more. And what we're doing by allowing thousands and thousands, tens of thousands of people in here that we just don't know anything about -- it's going to happen again because there's something wrong. And until we figure it out, we have to stop it. And that was really a large part of the speech that I just gave.HANNITY: I want to get into that...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)HANNITY: I want to get into the extreme vetting in a minute. You're right where -- don't worry. I know how to do my job. It's all right.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: I want to get into this because this is a really important question. You talked about countries that live under sharia and about people that want to come here from countries. If you grow up, for example, in Saudi Arabia...TRUMP: Right.HANNITY: ... which gave the Clinton Foundation up to $25 million...(BOOS)HANNITY: ... the Clinton library $10 million.TRUMP: They did.HANNITY: OK. And I can't find any -- I can't find any instances where Hillary criticized them. Women can't drive. Women are told how to dress.  Women are told if they can go to school or if they can go to work. We know gays and lesbians in Saudi Arabia can get the death penalty. You can't build a Jewish temple. There's a guy over here with a sign that says ""Jews for Trump.""(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HANNITY: And you can't build a Christian church. Would you ever -- would you ever take money from a country that treats gays, lesbians, Jews and Christians that way?TRUMP: Well, you don't want to do that.HANNITY: And women?TRUMP: And if they knew about it, that would be one thing, and I assume they know about it bigly (ph), but certainly, they know about it now, so maybe they can give the money back. I've actually called...(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I've actually called...HANNITY: Wait a minute. They knew about it because that has been Saudi Arabia's practice for years!TRUMP: But you know what? Let's give them the benefit of the doubt. They certainly knew about it...HANNITY: You're going to give Hillary the benefit of the doubt? I'm not.  OK. Go ahead.TRUMP: But you know what? You know what?HANNITY: Yes.TRUMP: They should give the money back, and I've been saying this for a long time. They should give the money back.HANNITY: Should they give the money back?(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HANNITY: What does it say, though...AUDIENCE: Give it back! Give it back!HANNITY: I guess there's (INAUDIBLE)HANNITY: What does it say, though, she claims to be the champion of women's rights and gay and lesbian rights and freedom of thought and religion.TRUMP: Well, you know, look, there's a whole big phony deal going on. And I have to say, when we were talking about Benghazi -- the ad -- I don't know if everybody remembers it. I remember it, at 3:00 o'clock in the morning, essentially who do you want to be at that phone at 3:00 o'clock in the morning? We had some people...(CROWD YELLING)TRUMP: We have some people -- oh, I'll be up. Hey, I'll be up. I will tell you that. She was not too effective.HANNITY: Well...(CROWD YELLING)TRUMP: You know -- you know, the amazing thing, because that was a big ad and everybody made a big deal, and she said she'd be there at 3:00 o'clock.  She wasn't there. But...HANNITY: This was 4:00 in the afternoon!TRUMP: But she had a certain friend that was contacting her routinely all day and all week and all the time, routinely, and you had 600 messages trying to get through, different forms of message, and not one of those messages got through.HANNITY: What is extreme vetting, and what does that mean, and how do you -- for example, if somebody grows up in a country where the Clintons take all their money from -- if they grow up there...(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: ... and they think that men can tell women how to dress and they can't drive and they can't go to school and they can't build a church or temple, and you grow up there and then you want to come to America, how do you possibly vet what's in their heart?TRUMP: Right, let me just tell you, you get very smart people, and there are those people. And they are very good at understanding what's going on.  But beyond that, you use social media, because a lot of these people, they are better at social media than we are. ISIS, if you look at what ISIS is doing with social, they are recruiting over the Internet. And I also said we have to end that. We have to knock it out, you know, some people would say that's a terrible thing, we have to end that.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: But, Sean, when you look at what's going on with the Internet and how ISIS is using the Internet and what they are doing and what they are doing to us, and then you have people in our country that say, oh, you can't do that, that's doing something so bad to us. Here we are, people that want to blow us up, you have to be very careful. We have to take them out very swiftly, because weapons are getting stronger and stronger, meaner and meaner, and, believe me, they want to come over here.Now, again, I was one that didn't want to go over there, but now you have no -- really, you have no choice.One thing, when Obama announced when he's going out, all they did is they sat back. I couldn't believe it, when I was watching this conference and he was talking about getting out and when they were getting out, I can't believe that he would say it. And even Hillary Clinton when she talks about the different things, why can't we just be quiet and do the job?(APPLAUSE)HANNITY: And you said you don't want to telegraph -- but when you talk about extreme vetting, and you did talk about in the cold war we did have ideological test screening, and this goes into your thinking. And how do you stop, how do you possibly know if somebody grows up under sharia and these extreme viewpoints that are the antithesis of our constitutional --TRUMP: So, when you look at San Bernardino, right, which was a horror show. She came in. She probably radicalized the husband, what a couple that was. That was a real beauty.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: So if they would have looked at social media, they would have seen that this woman --HANNITY: She was radicalized.TRUMP: We didn't look at social media. They just came in. They actually killed people that gave them a baby shower, a baby party. They had a child. 14 people that were killed, they were at the party honoring the birth of their baby, and then they went in and shot them all, killed them all. Look, there's something going on -- it's a sick deal. Sean, this is a sick, sick deal.HANNITY: Agreed, sick ideology. This is an advancement of a caliphate that wants worldwide either convert or die. Here's my question then. You pointed out that this guy, the father of this Orlando shooter, and he was smiling, as you said, and Hillary, and you talked about her stupidity and her weaknesses, and he's explained his radical views. What do we do when we find somebody that has extreme views? Do we throw them the hell out?TRUMP: I'd throw him out. If you look at him, I'd throw him out.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: You know, I looked at him, and you look, he's smiling. He had the red cap on. I thought it was one of my caps.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: No. Make America great again, I don't think so. But he has the red cap. He's got a big smile on his face during the whole thing. He obviously liked what he heard, OK, from her.Look, we have to be so tough and so smart and so vigilant, and, frankly, the Muslims have to help us, because they see what's going on in their community. We don't see it. They have to help us.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: If they are not going to help us, they are to blame also. And San Bernardino, they saw bombs lying around the apartment. People saw it. And they wanted to be -- they called it racial profiling. We didn't want to call in because of racial profiling. In other words, a lawyer got to them and said you got a problem here, you knew this was -- say racial profiling.  Look, whether it's racial profiling or politically correct, we better get smart. We are letting tens of thousands of people into our people. We don't know what the hell we're doing.HANNITY: And we can keep people like that safe. We have got to take a break. We'll come back. We have more with Donald Trump. We're at the Pabst Theater, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that and more as HANNITY continues straight ahead.  (APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: ISIL is not a caliphate.  It's a crime ring.HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Under President Obama and Vice President Biden, we are making progress.OBAMA: ISIL is on the defense.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What the problem with ""radical Islam.""CLINTON: Well, the problem is that that sounds like we are declaring war against a religion.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Allah Akbar!OBAMA: There's no magic to the phrase ""radical Islam."" It's a political talking point.CLINTON: Our enemy are these criminal killers who misuse a religion.OBAMA: ISIL is not Islamic. No religion condones the killing of innocents.CLINTON: You can talk about Islamists and don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.OBAMA: ISIL does not speak for Islam. They are thugs and killers, part of a cult of death.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, the Islamic State is not Islamic, there's no such things as radical Islam terrorism. By the way, they are the jayvee team, and of course they are contained and they do not represent an existential threat to the United States of America. Those are the words of President Obama and candidate Hillary Clinton.We continue now with Donald Trump. We're in Milwaukee in the Pabst Theater.(APPLAUSE)HANNITY: And also joining us, he's the author of ""The New York Times"" bestseller ""Defeating Jihad, The Winnable War,"" Dr. Gorka is with us. He's the professor of strategy and irregular warfare at the Institute of World Politics at Marine University.(APPLAUSE)HANNITY: You just heard jayvee team, they are contained, they're not an existential threat. We see the victims that we interviewed earlier. What don't the -- what does the president and Hillary not understand about this evil in our time?DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA, ""DEFEATING JIHAD"" AUTHOR: Sean, they don't understand the reality. The war is real, and the war is here. The war is here. The victims are here. This is a threat that is real and is escalating every day. ISIS makes between $2 and $4 million every 24 hours. It has captured territory larger than the U.K. with 6 million people living on their territory and has recruited 80,000 jihadists.HANNITY: Every 84 hours there's another attack.GORKA: Outside. So there's this hellhole in Iraq and Syria. Outside of the battle zone every 84 hours since June there's been a jihadi attack somewhere.HANNITY: Donald Trump, I know he gets beat up by the media, but he says he's going to have extreme vetting and he's going to build a wall. Who's going to pay for it?CROWD: Mexico!TRUMP: By the way, that's a little bit of a different subject.HANNITY: No, it's actually related, though, isn't it?TRUMP: It's related, little different, but it's related.HANNITY: You know, will those policies that he's advocating versus what we hear from them, will it keep -- let me backtrack. There's 1,000 FBI investigations ongoing now about ISIS in America in all 50 states, including Wisconsin. Will the policies Mr. Trump is advocating keep everybody here and across the country safer in your professional opinion?GORKA: Absolutely. Let's take politics --(APPLAUSE)GORKA: Let's take politics out of the equation. We have killed or arrested 108 people linked to ISIS in the last two years in America.  Linked to ISIS. Not Al Qaeda and ISIS, just ISIS. If you don't have borders, you don't have security.(APPLAUSE)HANNITY: Is there anything -- you heard him speak -- is there anything else you would add so we can keep the homeland safe? And you say we can defeat ISIS, can we defeat it as Mr. Trump is saying without ground troops?GORKA: We don't have to be the face of this war. It has to be our allies in the region. This is why Mr. Trump's speech was essential. It has to be our Muslim buddies. The Jordanians who have suffered so much, the Egyptians.HANNITY: Saudis.GORKA: We'll talk about that later, OK? It has to be the Jordanians, the Egyptians, who are the face of this war. We can provide the training, the special forces advisers, but we don't need to be the face of this war. And the most important thing Mr. Trump said, this is an ideological war like the cold war. We have got to destroy the brand of jihad.HANNITY: How dangerous is the Syrian refugees, and is it a better idea, I'm talking as if you're not here. Hi.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: No, but 550 percent increase that Hillary wants in Syrian refugees. You're offering to provide a safe zone, protected militarily.TRUMP: Paid for by somebody else.HANNITY: Paid for by other people.(APPLAUSE)HANNITY: By the way, Obama did accumulate more debt than any other president before him combined.TRUMP: Doubled it, he doubled it.HANNITY: But you'd also provide food, water, medicine, supplies, cots, baby formula. That sounds pretty liberal.TRUMP: In Syria, they have plenty of land, that I can tell you, but in Syria, and there's plenty of money. Because you look at the Gulf states, you look at the kind of money they have, nobody's seen money like that.  And they are not doing anything. They are not doing anything.HANNITY: All right, last question. James Comey, James Clapper, General John Allen, Michael Steinbeck, the assistant FBI director, the House homeland security secretary, have all warned us, and Brennan, our CIA director, that ISIS will infiltrate this refugee population. So is Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama gambling with the lives of these American people by taking them in, yes or no?GORKA: If Hillary Clinton becomes the commander in chief and continues the policies of this administration, American lives will be endangered. It is that simple.HANNITY: Is it fair to say they'll have blood on their hands if refugees kill Americans?GORKA: They already do.(APPLAUSE)HANNITY: All right, we're going to have to break. Dr. Gorka, good to see you, thank you.GORKA: Thank you.HANNITY: When we come back, we'll have more with Donald Trump and his plan to take out ISIS and radical extremists, protecting the homeland. This special edition of HANNITY continues from Milwaukee.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity"" as we continue with Donald Trump.  And we are from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.(APPLAUSE)HANNITY: Mr. Trump, all right, I know you get advice from a lot of people.  It probably drives you crazy at this point. Everybody has advice for you?TRUMP: Everybody. Right, everybody.HANNITY: One of the things, I watched your speech and I watched what you did. You laid out everything wrong you felt Hillary and Obama have done.  You laid out your solutions to how you would handle it differently. And the only thing I know friends of mine, I was at a party the other night.  ""I know you know Mr. Trump, we love him. Please tell him to only talk about Hillary and Obama.""(APPLAUSE)HANNITY: Well, wait a minute. You all agree with that?(APPLAUSE)HANNITY: All right, because in 84 days we're electing a president and they are the only two people that matter. What do you say to those who say don't talk about that?TRUMP: I really do mostly, but a lot times the mainstream media will put it on like if I'm talking about anything else they'll put that on. She is so protected. They are so protecting her.(BOOS)TRUMP: She hasn't had a news conference in, like, 250 days.HANNITY: I think she's in the witness protection program.TRUMP: She's being protected by the government. How she got away with e- mails is beyond anything I've ever seen in justice. But I have to say she's being protected and she's being protected by the media. When I say something about -- for instance, if I speak for an hour and talk about her for a half hour, 45 minutes, nothing gets on television. They'll put something else on. But they won't --HANNITY: But you mentioned the ""New York Times"" or Mr. Khan or the judge.TRUMP: Other things get on television.HANNITY: Do you think it's better not to talk about that?TRUMP: Let me just say, she's totally protected. I've never seen anything like it.HANNITY: By the media.TRUMP: And she doesn't really do that much. She'll give a speech on teleprompter, and then she'll disappear. I don't know if she goes home and goes to sleep. I think she sleeps.HANNITY: She takes weekends off.TRUMP: I guess she takes a lot of time off. And you know, that's frankly, frankly, it's really not fair.HANNITY: You know, I look at, I've asked you a lot about the economy.  We've got the lowest labor participation rate since the 70s, lost homeownership rate in 51 years, the worst recovery since the 40s. We've got 12 million more Americans on food stamps, 58 percent increase in the black community on food stamps. We've got 8 million to 10 million more people in poverty. My question is this. Forgetting the media, I have interviewed you a lot. How certain does the wall get built? How certain does Obamacare get repealed?TRUMP: You can never say 100 percent, but I'm telling you pretty close to 100 percent the wall gets built. We need it. The border patrol agents have endorsed me.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Along with sheriff Joe and everyone else.HANNITY: We're running out of time.TRUMP: It gets built.HANNITY: When you say, and you will rebuild the military, that's a promise?TRUMP: We have to rebuild. It's depleted.(APPLAUSE)HANNITY: And you will send education back to the states?TRUMP: A hundred percent.HANNITY: And you will make America energy independent? Can you do it in four years?TRUMP: It can be done faster than that. We have regulations that are absolutely destroying our energy.HANNITY: And will you appoint originalist justices like Scalia.TRUMP: Yes. I've already announced two of the 11 could be.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I have 11 people from which to pick. And I want to get as close to Scalia as I can.HANNITY: And you will repeal Obamacare and protect our Second Amendment rights?TRUMP: Obamacare is dying of its own volition.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: You saw what happened with Aetna.HANNITY: And those are promises you're telling the people of Wisconsin?HANNITY: One-hundred percent, I'm telling you, too.(APPLAUSE)HANNITY: Unfortunately, that is all the time we have left this evening.  As always, thank you for being with us. We will see you back here tomorrow night. Thank you, Wisconsin. Thank you, Milwaukee.  (APPLAUSE) Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.
