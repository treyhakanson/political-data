1	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2008/01/25/political-mudslinging	Political Mudslinging	"Flying mud and presidential politics. That is the subject of this evening's ""Talking Points Memo.""The latest poll has Barack Obama defeating Hillary Clinton by 15 points in South Carolina. And ""Talking Points"" believes Mr. Obama will win that state on Saturday night.In Florida, it's very close. McCain, Giuliani and Romney all have a chance to win, according to the latest polling. Governor Huckabee seems to be falling back.Now we don't know who will win next Tuesday's Florida race. The following Tuesday is the deadly 22-state exposition, where Clinton and Obama will get exactly what is coming to them, whatever that may be.Right now, Senator Clinton remains ahead nationally, but only by eight points. Obama seems to be closing. So there is tension in the air for both parties, but more so for the Democrats. There are now tough ads running in South Carolina.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hillary Clinton. She'll say anything and change nothing. It's time to turn the page. Paid for by Obama for America.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Listen to Barack Obama last week talking about Republicans.BARACK OBAMA: The Republicans were the party of ideas for a pretty long chunk of time there over the last 10, 15 years.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Really?(END VIDEO CLIP)Well that ad has just been pulled, by the way. But even more than paid advertising is the ascending bitterness between the Clinton and Obama camps. Yesterday, Bill Clinton got teed off when asked about the personal nature of the campaign, including the race factor.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL CLINTON: You're asking me about this? You sat there, and not one single solitary soul asked about any of this. And they never do. They're feeding you this because they know this is what you want to cover. This is what you live for, but this hurts the people of South Carolina, because the people of South Carolina are coming to these meetings and asking questions about what they care about. And what they care about is not going to be in the news coverage tonight because you don't care about it.(END VIDEO CLIP)President Clinton obviously angry about race questions, but his wife accuses Obama of working for an inner-city slumlord. So what does Mr. Clinton expect? Come on.""Talking Points"" believes the race issue is bogus, but that the bitter tone of the campaign is to be expected. Both senators want to be the most powerful person in the world, and that job comes at a price.So 12 days from now, the winners and losers will be much more sharply defined. Until then, we believe the nastiness will continue.And that's ""The Memo.""Pinheads & PatriotsTwo big moguls recently chatted about a ""Factor"" report. General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt sat down with ex-Disney boss Michael Eisner and addressed our story that GE does business with Iran.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHAEL EISNER, EX-CEO, DISNEY: Iran wants GE technology, and the U.S. government doesn't want American companies to deal...JEFFREY IMMELT, CEO, GENERAL ELECTRIC: Once like that, Michael, we stopped taking orders in a place like Iran in 2005. Most of our customers in Iran were European companies, you know, European oil companies, things like that. So we just didn't just go cold turkey, you know. We finished the projects we started, but we took no new orders.(END VIDEO CLIP)But of course GE continues to do business with the Iranian government. So Eisner is a patriot for even asking the question, even though the whole thing may have been rehearsed. As for Immelt, you make the call."

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The only thing that is holding us back is our politics. The only thing that's preventing us from passing the bills I just mentioned is the refusal of a faction in Congress to put country ahead of party. And that has to stop. I need your help sending a message to Congress that it's time to put the politics aside and get something done.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: President Obama continuing his bus tour in Iowa today. He was actually just 13 miles down the road from Texas Governor Rick Perry who was campaigning just in Dubuque in Iowa. The president said he is cutting Governor Perry a little slack, when talking -- when Governor Perry essentially said that he is running for the military to once again respect the office of the president. I'm paraphrasing that statement. But the president said he is new to the campaign trail. I'm going to cut him some slack.We're back with the panel. What about this Midwestern bus tour, Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: When the president accuses the Republicans of putting party over country and at another stop he said they want America to fail so they will succeed politically, that is a sophisticated way of essentially accusing the Republicans of near treasonous behavior. Now of course he is sophisticated and practiced and articulate so he won't use the word the way that Perry did. But it's the same idea.BAIER: Now wait, are you suggesting that Texas Governor Perry is not articulate?KRAUTHAMMER: I'm saying the way he articulated his attack on Bernanke, it was a demonstration that he does not have the art and the artful way of presenting it that Obama does.It's an essentially an equivalent claim. These people care nothing about country, only about self-interest and politics and re-election. So ""A,"" it demonstrates that the president is practiced at this. Perry could use practice. But it's essentially the same, I think unhealthy kind of attack. It's really something that neither party ought to do.And the president combines it with a pretense that, of course he stands above all of this. But look at this scene. He is on a political trip, which he pretends is not. Therefore, our tax money is paying for this trip under the pretense that it's explaining his policies. It's clearly a campaign trip. It's all a stump speech.So he is on political trip in which he accuses his opponents of playing politics putting it above country, when he himself is engaged in politics at the same time and pretending that only he speaks in the name of the national interest. He does this over and over again. I know it's going to be a theme of his campaign. I think he ought to be called out on it, if you're gonna call out Perry on his use of that, I'd call out the president on that as well.BAIER: Kirsten, it does have the Harry Truman ""give them hell"" running-against-Congress feel it to. And obviously Congress has an approval rating of roughly 10 percent, so politically it probably makes sense. But he said that he'll be putting forward a specific, quote, ""very specific"" plan to boost the economy, to create jobs and to control our deficit. Are there people, do you think, out there on the trail who are saying, where has this been?POWERS: Well, that would be the obvious question, I think. I don't really understand this trip completely. I don't know how he benefits from it. It does looks like a campaign stop. It does look like a reaction, actually, to Perry and Bachmann, and the Republicans out there. Ya know he's gotten in a fight with a Tea Partier.BAIER: That was last night.POWERS: Yeah, I mean, it's just -- it's not really enhancing his stature at all.And then he's also talking a lot about how he is the compromiser and Republicans won't compromise. And of course Democrats don't want to hear this. Democrats are angry at him. Democrats don't want him compromising. That's exactly their issue with him. So I just don't see how this is benefiting him.BAIER: We should clarify -- the fight with the Tea Party person was a question about Vice President Biden calling Tea Party members terrorists. And the president denied that and pushed back, and said they held him up against the cliff of this default.Bill, what about the trip overall and the overall optics of it?BILL KRISTOL, EDITOR, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: I think it's kind of a disaster. I think this White House is really flailing about. I was with the last president to lose after one term, I was in his White House, George H.W. Bush, a fine president, who nonetheless was denied re-election in 1992. We didn't panic until 1992 until the election year and started doing stupid things.And they are panicking the summer before the election. Harry Truman, his great whistle stop tour, speaking from the back of trains, that was two months before the election. It only makes sense for President Obama after the Democratic convention to go around beating up the Republican Congress.But he's now president of the United States. And it's a big advantage still to be president. I don't care how much anti-incumbent sentiment there is or how much people are unhappy, he should take advantage of being president. And I think with this bus tour, he's -- it's him on one bus and Rick Perry is on another bus. And we're sitting here comparing the two of them and they're comparing each other. And he's taken himself down to the level of a candidate for president from being president, I think.KRAUTHAMMER: And that's the irony of it all. He pretends in his speeches and the content of his speeches that he hovers above all of this in an Olympian way. And yet, as Bill indicates, he is down there in the mud at the same level, with people who are competing with him, who want the stature that the job endows in him. And he -- I think he is squandering it. I think he is in a panic mode.BAIER: That's it for panel. But stay tuned for all of the scrutiny on the newest member of the GOP field.Content and Programming Copyright 2011 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2011 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

The interviews with 1,200adults were done in September.Forty percent of those surveyed think election coverage carries a liberal bias. Twenty-one percent think it is too conservative -- and 30 percent think it is balanced.Eighty-eight percent think campaign coverage focuses on trivial issues. Sixty-one percent believe the media do not provide enough coverage of policy plans. And 43 percent say there is not enough coverage of candidates' personal values and ethics.Photo ShoppedAn exhibit at the New York Public Library features President Bush and other administration officials in doctored ""mug shots"" -- and it has a lot of people upset.The New York Daily News reports the pictures are drawing fire from the New York Republican Party and members of the public.State GOP communications director Matthew Walter says it is ""inappropriate political attack art"" -- and should not be in a taxpayer-funded building.One member of the public tells the paper he was stunned to see the exhibit in a library, which is supposed to be neutral ground.The library's print collection curator says the exhibit is in keeping with its historical tradition and is a relevant example of political commentary.Celebrity EndorsementsSpeaking of political commentary -- game show host Pat Sajak says he and other famous folks have no business telling people who to vote for.Sajak writes -- ""If any group of citizens is uniquely unqualified to tell someone else how to vote, it's those of us who live in the sheltered, privileged arena of celebrity-hood ... The idea of choosing the Leader of the Free World based on the advice of someone who lives in the cloistered world of stardom seems a bit loony to me.""Sajak adds -- ""the idea that a gold record, a top-ten TV show or an Oscar translates into some sort of political wisdom doesn't make much sense to me. Trust me, one's view of the world isn't any clearer from the back seat of a limo.""Cellphone RageAnd a judge in Niagara Falls, New York has lost his job -- after taking 46 people into custody when a cell phone rang while court was in session. Judge Robert Restaino was presiding over a family court hearing in March of 2005 when the phone went off. He demanded to know whose it was -- no one volunteered -- so he ordered the doors locked and everyone detained.Most people got out on bond but 14 actually wound up in jail. The New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct was not amused. It called Restaino's decision ""an egregious and unprecedented abuse of judicial power ... that caused irreparable damage to public confidence in the fair and proper administration of justice in his court."" The judge has 30 days to appeal the decision.-- FOX News Channel's Martin Hill contributed to this report."
