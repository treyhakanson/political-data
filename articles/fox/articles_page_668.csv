This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" September 29, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, a big story out of campaign 2016 as a new look at battleground polls shows Donald Trump closing the gap in states that matter most, even winning states that repeatedly voted for President Obama.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly. Today we have been pouring over data from RealClearPolitics.com and found some dramatic numbers in the seven key states that together represent more than a third of all of the electoral votes needed to win. According to the Real Clear Politics average of polls, Donald Trump is now leading in five of the seven top battleground states.He's up by five points in Iowa, more than two points in Nevada, two in Ohio, almost a point in North Carolina and is just edging out Mrs. Clinton in Colorado. Meantime it is a dead heat in Florida. And while she is still leading in Pennsylvania, Trump has narrowed the gap to less than two points in a state the pundits suggested he could not win. What's more, all of these states went for President Obama in the last two election cycles with the exception of North Carolina.We have a great lineup to discuss all of this tonight including Karl Rove who is here with a warning about the format of the next debate.Plus, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn who has been helping Mr. Trump shapes his message and prepare for debates. And Tom Bevan, co-founder and publisher of Real Clear Politics, he is here to discuss those poll numbers.  And we're going to start with him.Tom, good to see you. So, these numbers are good for Trump. And Florida, let's start there. You say is the most important state for both of them.  TOM BEVAN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS CO-FOUNDER: It is. And particular for Donald Trump. I mean, if you look at the map, he just can't get there unless he wins the 29 electoral votes. He'd basically helped her run the table. It would take something of a miracle. So, that's critical for Donald Trump. That's a state that Obama won by less than one a point in 2012. It's now under point in our Real Clear Politics average.It's been really close for basically the entire month of September. And so you know, Trump is going to try and run up his numbers in the North and the panhandle. Clinton will run up her numbers in Southern Florida and then the battle will be fought as it always is in Florida in that I-4 corridor of Hillsborough County around Tampa is where that state will be decided.KELLY: Okay. North Carolina, that's, you know, you tell me who that is suppose -- typically traditionally would have gone Republican.  BEVAN: Right. Obama won in 2008 but didn't in 2012. He lost it by two points to Mitt Romney. This is a state Trump has to keep in the Republican column. Fifteen electoral votes and it's close. It's very, very close.  In fact, we have seven polls there, three of them favor Trump, two of them favor Clinton and two of them are exactly tied. So, it is that close in North Carolina. And again that's one that Trump really needs to keep in the Republican column. If he loses that state it's going to really complicate his path to 270.  KELLY: Ohio.  BEVAN: Ohio. No Republican has ever won the White House without it. It will probably be the same again this year. That is one state. Trump has a small but stable lead there. In all of the polls that we have in the month of September, he's leading by, you know, a little bit. Two points in our average overall.KELLY: And that was the same thing with Obama last time around. He was ahead by Mitt Romney just by a bit in all of those polls in Ohio and that was how it turned out.BEVAN: Exactly. In fact, Obama won nine out of the ten battleground states. He was ahead with small leads in all of the states and they held up for him.  KELLY: Uh-hm. Okay. Let's talk about Colorado. Because she was ahead of Trump by 11 points in Colorado a month ago.  BEVAN: Yes. This to me is Clinton's sort of fire wall state. Right?  It's a state that Obama won handily in '08, in 12. Clinton as you've mentioned, she had a double digit lead there just a few weeks ago and now Trump is leading by less than a point. And pretty dramatic drop and altitude for Clinton there. And the nine electoral votes, it's not a ton but it's key. If she can hold on to Colorado, she's going to force Trump to win another state that might be a little tougher for him. So, that is a state to definitely keep an eye on, for Hillary Clinton.  KELLY: And then the be all end all Pennsylvania. I mean if Trump could win that, it would be huge. But the odds of him winning it, even though it's tightened, you tell me.BEVAN: The odds of it -- look. This is the Lucy with the football state for Republicans. Every four years they go in there and they say, we've got a chance, we've got a chance and then Lucy pulls the football away and it's never even really that close. This year, however, again, given the makeup of the states, given Clinton, it's another state where she's lost a lot of altitude, down to under two points now in the most latest Real Clear Politics average of polls, has Democrats really worried. And Republicans are again licking their chops at that state. But it is a state that has not gone well for Republicans in the final analysis. So, we'll have to wait and see.  KELLY: Uh-hm. Tom, thank you.BEVAN: You bet, Megyn.  KELLY: Karl Rove has some thoughts on these polls and how to win from here. He's a FOX News contributor and former deputy chief of staff to President George W. Bush. Karl, good to see you.Let's just take a couple of those -- in Pennsylvania, David Plouffe who got Barack Obama elected twice was on the show this week saying, it doesn't exist for the Republicans. Don't kid yourself. Do you agree?KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No. I think it's very much up in the air. Because look, Trump has an ability to attract blue collar working class Democrats --KELLY: He knows that. But Plouffe said there are too many Democrats who are going to come out of Philadelphia to overwhelm them.  ROVE: Look. That will be true if she gets the same kind of turnout that Barack Obama got. Think about this. Obama carried the city of Philadelphia by 550,000 votes and loses the rest of the state. But Romney wins it by about 150,000 votes, the rest of the state. But loses the state by 300 and some-odd thousands votes.KELLY: Wow!ROVE: So, you know, it depends on the level of turnout in the African- American community in Philadelphia and it also depends upon how well Trump does with white college educated voters in the Southern Philadelphia particularly women. And that is where his weak point is in the state.  He's over performing the western part of the state, blue collar, Democrats, he looks like he's underperforming among Independents and soft Republicans --  KELLY: We've heard it --ROVE: -- in the suburbs and we don't know about the city of Philadelphia.  KELLY: We've heard this time after time that Trump and Clinton are fighting over white college educated women and that the debate was supposed to be aimed according to Judge Trippi and some others at white college educated women. And that was some of the criticism that Trump received thereafter saying, what did you do during that debate to appeal to white college educated women. On the list is not calling Miss Universe fat. A controversy that continues to dog him. Go ahead.ROVE: Yes. Look. If he makes this about change versus the status quo, not about his personal scandals, not about her personal scandals, then he's got the shot to win. If he lets himself, if he takes the bait and gets drawn in on these things, he's in trouble. And particularly if he not only gets drawn into him in the debate but then squanders a valuable day. Look Megyn, we're at the point where the most valuable thing that a presidential campaign has is time and he chewed up a valuable day arguing over something that is completely, you know, on the edges of this debate and certainly not central to his ability to make a winning case.  KELLY: Uh-hm. And so now we're, you know, a week or so away from the next presidential debate and it will be a town hall format. And I want to play this clip because Trump, he has had limited town hall experience but he's had some town hall experience and here was a testy moment that happened on February 18th, what he had with CNN. You tell me whether he should repeat this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you said that George W. Bush, which was our last Republican president, a man I respect greatly, a person that we really fought for when he was up against a lot of pressure, that he lied to get us in the war in Iraq. That stung me very deeply.  DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Okay.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't believe that. I'm just wondering given some time passing, perhaps you've rethought that. Would you be willing to rethink that?TRUMP: Well, a lot of people agree with what I said.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You think the president of the United States George W. Bush, lied --TRUMP: Well, look, I'm not going to get your vote but that's okay.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Karl?ROVE: Town hall meetings are tough because there's a tendency when you get into a debate to think that you're speaking either to the camera or that you're engaged with your opponent. But a town hall meeting is a conversation, a one-on-one conversation with somebody looking you in the face, not too many feet away and the ability of a candidate to display empathy and to sound like they're listening, to somehow make a connection with that person and then to take the conversation the direction that they want to go.I mean there was no need to get in an argument or insult that voter. And he cannot do that in the coming week. He's got to also be careful about being too harsh on his attacks on Hillary Clinton. It's one thing when you're standing there just the two of you on a stage. But if you're in the room, the dynamic of those kinds of personal attacks changes pretty dramatically.  KELLY: Uh-hm. Karl, great to see you.  ROVE: You bet. Thank you.KELLY: Well, just last night we spoke to Trump Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway who suggested that in the next debate, she wants to see the same Donald Trump who showed up for the beginning of the first debate. Watch.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: I think if Mr. Trump looks back at the first 30 minutes or so in the debate, he'll see some real highlights, his ability to sort of joust and jab with Hillary Clinton.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Lieutenant General Michael Flynn is the former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and a Trump national security adviser. Good to see you, General. Thanks for being here.LT. GEN. MICHAEL FLYNN (RET.), FORMER DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY DIRECTOR:  Thanks for having me.KELLY: So the ""The New York Times"" is reporting that Trump's struggles in the debate are attributable to his inadequate or improper debate prep and they site in particular these two retired military generals, right? Who are just screwing the whole thing up. Is that you?FLYNN: That's obviously me who is one of them and a good friend of mine is the other. So, I mean, I saw that and I just find that pretty laughable.  The preparation that he had and I think Kellyanne was right on the money.  That the first 30 to 40 minutes and I actually timed it all, as sitting in the debate hall there. That first 40 minutes was about the economy, prosperity, you know, tax reform and I think Donald Trump nailed it.What I really saw at the second half of the debate really was frankly the poor judgment on some of the issues that were picked up on by Hillary Clinton, you know, where she brought in, you know, the Miss Universe pageant winner. And I thought that that was I mean -- you look at some of the things that have come out about this young lady. You know --KELLY: Even though this woman had some trouble, his comments about her weight are on camera. Not those specific ones but many others.  FLYNN: It just shows the bad judgment. But the other thing is, you know, I've been in Lester Holt's seat. I would have asked much tougher questions and I would have focused on three things, which was, you know, the direction of the country, prosperity and I think --KELLY: Security.FLYNN: American security. And hone of that was talked about for almost, you know, almost an hour.  KELLY: Okay. But, you know, as the candidate you've got to be able to get in the stuff that you want to get in.  FLYNN: Yes. That's right. That's right.  KELLY: So are you still on the debate team? All right. So, what's going to happen differently? What is happening differently?FLYNN: Yes. Well, I think that Donald Trump -- we were up in New Hampshire today actually. So, your lay down of all the polls that he's -- and the momentum that the entire Trump campaign team has --KELLY: He's looking good there.FLYNN: -- and feeling very good. And the pitch that he gave up in New Hampshire was superb today. So, I think a lot of this is just continuing to show, you know, in the opponent of Hillary Clinton, the bad judgment that she had displayed in both foreign policy and even here as a senator of the state of New York where she, I mean, I don't know what accomplishments she has here. Really none.In fact the loss of I understand a couple hundred thousand jobs out of New York. So, she has really no good things to sort of sink her teeth into in terms of accomplishments. Her judgment and some of the issues that she has been involved in from her judgment of using a server, a private server at her home where she plays national security. All of those things --KELLY: He knew these things before the first debate. What will change? I mean, like he just needs --FLYNN: Well, one of the things that I think that he, you know, came across -- I actually thought that he won the debate. I mean hands down won the debate. I think that we didn't do a good enough job probably spinning it after, all of the spin stuff that happens. And I think that the mainstream media actually did sort of their job of making sure that for the last couple of days talking up about how Hillary Clinton did and how Donald Trump, you know, didn't do. So you know, I really look at this thing and I say, hey, look, I think that Donald Trump won that debate the other night and I think, I believe, and you know, you can do all of the scientific polling -- and I'm not a pollster.But what I saw and the people that I've been talking to -- and I paid very close attention to this sort of the information domain. And there are awful lots of people that are looking at Donald Trump in a much different way and saying, this is a guy that I can see as the president of the United States and the commander-in-chief. And frankly, the judgment and the decisions that Hillary Clinton has made have been just absolutely poor.  KELLY: Great to see you, General.FLYNN: Great. Thanks for having me on.KELLY: Thanks for being here.Well, there are also new theories circulating tonight about the last debate including the real meaning of this mysterious bump in the back of Hillary Clinton's jacket and whether she was using some sort of hand signals.  Bump, bump, bump.  We will investigate with Brian Kilmeade.Plus, Donald Trump today started talking about how Bill and Hillary Clinton treated the women who came forward to accuse the former president.And Trump's spokesperson Katrina Pierson and DNC member Robert Zimmerman are next on whether or not this is fair game.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The Clintons are the sordid past. We will be the very bright and clean future.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)FLYNN: Breaking tonight, new evidence that Donald Trump may be launching a controversial line of attack on the Clinton camp after three straight days of getting hit over history of women. Politico reporting today that Trump's campaign put out talking points this afternoon about how Hillary Clinton and her husband worked together to destroy Bill Clinton's accusers.  It came on the same day The Washington Post published a wildly red report questioning whether Hillary Clinton was an enabler for her womanizing husband or someone just defending their family.Trump's spokesperson Katrina Pierson and DNC committee member Robert Zimmerman are here in a moment. But first, we go to Trace Gallagher on why the story is blowing up today. Trace?  TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, Donald Trump, the Trump campaign and Trump surrogates have all argued that what's important in this campaign is not Bill Clinton's infidelities but rather the way Hillary Clinton has responded to her husband's accusers. Unfairly lashing out of them like Gennifer Flowers, the singer who in 1992 sold star magazine the story of her affair with Bill Clinton. At the time Hillary Clinton described Flowers this way during an interview with ABC's primetime live.  Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: You get your 15 minutes of fame and you get your picture on the front page of every newspaper and you're some failed cabaret singer who doesn't even have much of a resume to fall back on.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Clinton went on to say if she had the chance to cross-examine Flowers, she would, quote, ""crucify her."" Six years later, Bill Clinton admitted to the affair. When a woman told Penthouse magazine that an Arkansas state trooper approached her on the Governor Clinton's behalf, Hillary Clinton reportedly said, quote, ""We have to destroy her story.""  And in 1994, Arkansas State employee Paula Jones alleged in a lawsuit that Bill Clinton propositioned her in a hotel room three years earlier.Bill Clinton dismissed the allegation as untrue and Jones was painted as promiscuous trailer park trash. Bill Clinton then settled the lawsuit for $850,000. During that lawsuit, Paul Jones' attorneys found out about an intern named Monica Lewinsky and Hillary Clinton went back on the attack.  Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: The great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it, is this vast right wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Hillary also portrayed Lewinsky as being unstable. And last November, Hillary Clinton tweeted that assault victims deserved to be believed. When asked if that applied to her husband's accusers, Clinton said this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I would say that everybody should be believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: And the Clinton campaign now says Trump is mistaken if he thinks going after her for defending her husband will throw her off her game -- Megyn.  KELLY: Trace, thank you.At the same time Mr. Trump appears ready to start bringing up Bill Clinton and the past, you know, the women in his past. Some Republicans were today quoted, ""warning Trump to keep Lewinsky and these others out of it."" The issue came up during an interview today in New Hampshire. Watch how Donald Trump handled it.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You didn't mention Bill Clinton and his past affairs.  You may do this in this second debate?TRUMP: Well, she was very nasty to me. And I was going to do it and I saw Chelsea sitting out in the audience and I just didn't want to go there. I thought it would be too disrespectful. I just didn't want to do it. But she was very nasty. We'll see what happens. But I just didn't want to put it there. It's a hard thing to say in front of somebody's daughter.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If it does come up though in the next debate, do you think maybe your past-marital history is also fair game?TRUMP: I guess. I mean, that can do. But it's a lot different than his.  That I can tell you. I mean, we have a situation where we have a president who was a disaster and he was ultimately impeached over it in a sense for lying. And so we'll see whether or not we discuss it.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're not worried about your past history at all?TRUMP: No, not at all. And I have a very good history.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, Katrina Pierson, Trump campaign national spokesperson and Robert Zimmerman who is a Clinton supporter and DNC committee member. Good to see you both.ROBERT ZIMMERMAN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Good to be with you.KELLY: So, let me start with you, Robert, because you saw the Trace report. A lot of the young people don't even know about Bill Clinton's history. But listen, he cheated on Hillary Clinton more than once and that's been documented and he was accused of more than just having consensual affairs but actually sexual assault especially by Paula Jones in a lawsuit that was settled for almost seven figures. Why is that not fair game?ZIMMERMAN: Oh, come on, Megyn. Let's cut through all of the type of star magazine type of gossip and let's deal with some, let's deal with the political reality, Megyn. I mean, the reality is that this week, Donald Trump lost two debates, Monday night against Hillary Clinton and then Tuesday and Wednesday, Alicia Machado cleaned his clock when he was trying to attack --  KELLY: Okay. But why are those not fair game?ZIMMERMAN: Here is the reality, Megyn. He is trying to change the topic.  Because in today's news, it was reported that he settled a lawsuit in 2012 where he was asking his employees to fire what he described as unattractive women.KELLY: We're going to get to that. We're going to get to that in a little later in the show. But if you can just answer my question, RobertZIMMERMAN: I am answering your question, Megyn.KELLY: So, even if that's all true, even this is a defensive move by Trump, why it's not fair to ask about how Hillary treated the women who came forward and there were plenty of them --ZIMMERMAN: Hillary stood up for her husband, she stood up for her marriage. And very frankly, whenever Republicans have tried to attack her for that, they have absolutely gone down in flames. That's why you have the leading Republican senators, including Senator Wicker who is in charge of the Republican Senate campaigns pleading with Trump not to go there.  It's a failed strategy because Hillary Clinton stood up for her marriage and stoop up for her husband.  KELLY: Katrina?KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP CAMPAIGN NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: Look, this is not about Bill Clinton or even what he did for that matter. This is solely about what Hillary Clinton did. She has launched this campaign on sexism, she accused Bernie Sanders of sexism and now they're expecting Donald Trump to be accused of being a sexist and not to defend himself. And the reason why this is fair game is simply because this is about Hillary Clinton's trustworthiness and accountability. She knew her husband was cheating on her and she blamed it on the vast right wing conspiracy.  KELLY: Well, she said she didn't know.  PIERSON: She knew this was happening and shifted the blame on to the women and you know what, Megyn, she's right. If she had the opportunity to cross witness to cross-examine the witnesses, she would have crucified them just like she did, a 12-year-old little girl who was brutally raped by a grown man.  KELLY: Let me as you this question, okay? Let me ask you this question.  Which is a lot of women out there will see Hillary Clinton with her husband cheating on her and say, of course she wanted to tear down the story, of course she wanted to say it's not true and dismiss the woman and say, I don't believe, they're liars. A lot of women will see that and forgive it and not see it as this cardinal sin. Why are they wrong?PIERSON: No. You're absolutely right. Of course she would want to fix that. But then you can't go around and call yourself the champion of women. It's the hypocrisy that is at issue here.  ZIMMERMAN: Well, actually Katrina, women are calling her the champion of women --PIERSON: And you can't go around blaming other people -- you can't go around blaming other people for what you and your husband have done.KELLY: Okay. Let me ask you this, Robert.PIERSON: And that's the problem.KELLY: Wait. In addition to the ones that we highlighted there, Kathleen Willey is another person who accused Bill Clinton. She's been in the program and she says that Hillary Clinton too --(CROSSTALK)The entire Clinton team tried to destroy her. Here she is in September 22nd, 2000 alleging the behavior she had received. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KATHLEEN WILLEY, FORMER WHITE HOUSE VOLUNTEER AIDE: Today, I am suing the President, the First Lady and the White House aides because of their efforts to intimidate and harass me. Before I testified in the Paula Jones case, a stranger approached me, mentioned my 13-year-old cat who had disappeared, my tires which had been vandalized and asked how my children by name were and said, you're just not getting the message. After my testimony before Judge Stark's grand jury and my appearance on ""60 Minutes,"" White House aide Sidney Blumenthal boasted that my reputation would be ruined in a matter of days.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Robert, what of it?ZIMMERMAN: Here's the bottom-line, Megyn. Donald Trump can run his campaign with Rush Limbaugh and the National Enquirer any way they want.  The bottom-line here is, women are standing up in record numbers in support for Hillary Clinton. It's not that she's calling herself the champion of women but women are recognizing her by 51 to 32 I believe the most recent ""Wall Street Journal"" NBC News poll. And here's the point. Donald Trump's strategy in terms of reaching out to women has lowered his numbers, that not only she is running behind Mitt Romney, he's actually running down right now where he's at the same numbers with Hispanic and African-American voters.  KELLY: But you tell me, Katrina. You tell me, if you've got women on the record like Kathleen Willey saying what she just said, you've got the Clinton camp, not Hillary herself so far as we can see. But team Clinton during, you know, this women coming forward, dismissing the women as floozies, bimbos, stalkers, in the case of Monica Lewinsky, this did come from Hillary, narcissistic loony tunes and on and on, whether that is fair game for Donald Trump who has said many of those same things.  ZIMMERMAN: No, it's not fair game. It's a losing strategy.KELLY: That is for Katrina.(CROSSTALK)PIERSON: No. This is fair game because some of the allegations being made against Donald Trump are just that. Allegations. And you cross-examined the most recent miss -- the recent accusation we had from Mr. Trump which was Miss Universe, the very first winner and she couldn't even corroborate what she even said Mr. Trump called her. These are allegations. The reason why this is important, these are actual actions that were taken against Hillary Clinton. She is calling herself the champion of women and she's --ZIMMERMAN: So are women, Katrina. Why is Donald Trump running so poorly in the polls?KELLY: Okay.ZIMMERMAN: Right now his numbers are dropping to the same level with Hispanics and African-Americans.PIERSON: He's not running so poorly --(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Ana Navarro, she's run a cable competitor, she came out today and she said, hell hath no fury like a Latino woman called fat.ZIMMERMAN: I'm sorry. One a time please?KELLY: I got to go. I got to leave it at that. But I do want to clear one thing up for the record. The allegations that Miss Universe said against Donald Trump that he called her Miss Piggy, that he called her Miss Housekeeping, those have not been substantiated by third party witnesses, that's true. But him calling her, you know, overweight, saying she would eat the whole gymnasium, saying she would love to eat, saying she would eat anything you put in front of her and criticizing her weight has been well documented.He even did it this week on ""Fox & Friends."" This stuff about Hillary Clinton herself, as far as we can find calling anybody a bimbo but the team Clinton was referring to women in those terms I just described. So, those were allegations about team Clinton, not about her directly.  And we're not done with the women talk yet because apparently that's taken over 2016. There are now at least a half dozen conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton, oh, this is a different story. But this is interesting too. About Hillary and Monday night's debate. Did she have a hidden earpiece? Was she using some sort of hand signals? You know, like, you know, I don't know how do they do it, the catcher and the pitcher? They don't do this. Brian Kilmeade investigated. He's here with what he found.  Plus, you just heard about the new controversy that blew up today at one of Donald Trump's golf courses. We'll show you what that involves, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)ANNOUNCER: From the world headquarters of Fox News, it's THE KELLY FILE with Megyn Kelly.KELLY: Developing tonight, the Trump campaign defending against a new report raising questions about his treatment of women. This one involves a lengthy story in the ""L.A. Times"" looking into an employee lawsuit at one of Trump's golf clubs. Among the many complaints in the suit are affidavits, sworn testimony from staffers at the club who said, ""Trump wanted to fire women employees who weren't pretty enough."" Trace Gallagher is in our west coast newsroom in Los Angeles. Trace?GALLAGHER: Megyn, when Donald Trump visited his golf course along the ocean here in southern California, his managers claim they went on alert to schedule young, thin pretty women to staff the restaurant. They saw when Trump saw unattractive women he wanted them fired. In a sworn declaration for a lawsuit on labor relations filed in 2012, a former restaurant manager at the club said quoting, ""One time he took me aside and said, I want you to get some good looking hostesses here. People like to see good looking people when they come in.""The former club catering director said quote, ""I witnessed Donald Trump tell managers many times while he was visiting the club that the restaurant hostesses were not pretty enough and that they should be fired and replaced with more attractive women."" The catering director went on to say her boss once told her, quote, ""Mr. Trump doesn't like fat people and that he would not like seeing an unnamed employee when he was on the premises.Even some of the good-looking hostesses complained that Trump's behavior toward them was inappropriate. A Trump attorney says the allegations are meritless but these type of accusations were raised again during this week's debate when Hillary Clinton told the story of Donald Trump fat shaming Alicia Machado after she won Miss Universe in 1996. But now Newt Gingrich is defending Trump. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: You're not supposed to gain 60 pounds during the year that you're Miss Universe.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: In case you didn't hear, Gingrich said you're not supposed to gain 60 pounds during your year that you're Miss Universe. The Clinton campaign spokeswoman responded tweeting, ""I'm sorry I can't get past this. Newt Gingrich is criticizing someone for their weight."" Megyn.KELLY: I'm sure all of the beauty contestants will be looking to him for further advice and counsel on how they can really bring home the title. Trace, thank you. Joining me now with more, Clinton supporter and senior fellow of the New Leaders Council, Krystal Ball and spokesman of the leading pro Trump super PAC and Navy veteran -- Navy SEAL veteran, Karl Higbie, great to see you both.KARL HIGBIE, VETERAN AND TRUMP SUPPORTER: Thanks Megyn.KRYSTAL BALL, JOURNALIST AND ACTIVIST: Great to see you Megyn.KELLY: Let's start with you Karl.HIGBIE: Oh boy.KELLY: Why don't they just shut up about the women and how big they're supposed to be?HIGBIE: You know, Megyn, this is a little bit ridiculous. I see us in the middle of a presidential campaign, the most -- probably the most, you know, turmoiled among we've seen in recent years and we're sitting and talking about whether Donald Trump called someone fat 20 years ago. I just really don't see why the media is focusing on this when you have Hillary with Benghazi, e-mails, long under oath (ph), any number of other things and we're sitting and talking about this.KELLY: The reason is because many people find that kind objectification objectionable and you know, you really shouldn't alienate half of the country, women, and you shouldn't alienate 70 percent of the country who are overweight.HIGBIE: Unfortunately, yes.KELLY: It is a good way to lose votes.HIGBIE: Yeah, you know, it is a good way to lose votes but the fact of the matter is look, Donald Trump has employed -- I mean, look, his campaign spokeswoman, you just had her on. She's a woman who's communication director a woman. His campaign -- the CEO of his campaign is a woman. I know all of these people. They love Donald Trump. They work well with him. They don't have any of these problems with him so I don't understand like where these things, these allegations are coming from.KELLY: I mean listen, Karl, not to put a point on it but they're all beautiful and none of them are overweight. The question that these stories are raising, Krystal, is whether as this allegation in the sworn affidavit suggested, quote, ""Mr. Trump does not like fat people and wants to make sure he has pretty people working as the face of his organizations.""BALL: Well and here's the big problem for him, Megyn. I mean, do you think that anyone out there read that story and was shocked and said oh no, Mr. Trump would never treat women that way. Of course not. Because his comments over the years and continuing into this presidential election campaign have reflected a man who puts a lot of priority, perhaps first priority on a way that a woman looks.Grading them on the one to 10 scale. He told a female reporter in this campaign that she had a job because she was beautiful. So this comes as a shock to absolutely no one that Donald Trump is a sexist pig. Why are we talking about it? A, because he keeps talking about it and keeps insisting that Ms. Machado gained a massive amount of weight. And B, because it's conscious relevance...HIGBIE: And then they put her on an exercise program, a luxury exercise program.BALL: It's kind of relevant to people whether their future president happens to also be a sexist pig. I think that's kind of an important piece of information that actually a lot of voters might care about.KELLY: So, the thing is, you know, you can actually -- legally, you can make the argument for certain looks requirements. There was a big case about whether Vegas hostesses could be forced to wear makeup and the answer was they could because it's part of like a uniform -- a presentation of company image. It's actually not illegal necessarily, but that's different from disqualifying all heavy people.That's a different thing all together. And even Trump -- this woman who ran Trump's construction company and it was a great role. He gave her an amazing promotion. Even she told the ""New York Times"" that he looked at her, she's a larger size woman and said, ""You like your candy."" I mean, you know, this is alienating to a lot of people who struggle with eating.HIGBIE: Yeah, I mean, you know what Megyn, the fact of the matter is 50 percent of our country is drastically overweight and you know what...KELLY: Including Trump.HIGBIE: Yeah, well Trump did say he could shed a few pounds. But the fact is, who cares? We're talking about a little bit of weight and this a woman -- also, this Machado woman, he gave her a luxury exercise program and they posed for all this pictures and she was so happy to accept that, that he was willing to let her keep her title.KELLY: She only posed for the pictures because he ambushed her at the exercise facility with 80 reporters who took pictures of her while Donald Trump looked at her from the sidelines. I mean that is what happened there.HIGBIE: He didn't ambush her. He was on her -- he's paid, you know, luxury fitness program.KELLY: She said she did.HIGBIE: No, and she also says a lot of other things. But the fact of the matter is, she was on his luxury exercise program and he allowed her to keep her title and he worked with her and he said wanted -- he defended her job because she was overweight and then helps her get back down to weight. Come on, Megyn.BALL: If I could help you -- if I could help you with this, there's a very simple response to what we have seen on camera in terms of Mr. Trump's treatment of Ms. Machado and it's called an apology. It's not called trying to smear her and trying to continue to insist she gained few much weight. Its (inaudible), I'm sorry for the way that you were treated and the way that you felt. It's that easy.HIGBIE: Maybe you should talk to your candidate.BALL: And let me tell you about who cares about this?KELLY: You know, I'll tell you what.BALL: Take a look at the polls and I think you'll find out who cares about this.KELLY: I come from a long line of people who also love food, right?HIGBIE: I love food.KELLY: And the last thing that an overweight person needs to be told is that they're overweight. That's the last thing and like, trust me, I know.BALL: It doesn't help.HIGBIE: Look, I was a fat kid in middle school, I get it.KELLY: Well now you're a Navy SEAL so nobody feels sad for you. All right, great to see you bothHIGBIE: Thank you, Megyn.KELLY: They're like the most elite athletes in the country. OK, so far 2016 has involved debates of water drinking, finger size, the eating habits of a former beauty queen, whether the hostesses at the Trump golf course need to be hot and now it involves celebrities taking their clothes off for Hillary Clinton. Brian Kilmeade volunteered to investigate that. He's here to tell us why they might want to keep their clothes back on.Plus, a closer look at the campaign messages scoring the biggest points. Frank Luntz is here with a good segment coming up.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I did not e-mail any classified material to any classified material to anyone on my e-mail. There is no classified material(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Does she have a good body? No, is she ever fa? Absolutely.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you treat women with respect?TRUMP: I can't say that either.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Forty days out from election day and that Clinton ad is getting more buzz this week than perhaps any political spot in recent months. But when it comes to attacking a candidate by using their own words, the Trump campaign has also come up with a pretty powerful message of its own.Pollster Frank Luntz recently measured the effectiveness of a pro-Trump ad entirely in Mrs. Clinton's own words. He joins us now. Frank, let's watch the commercial with the focus group dials (ph) and then you can tell us more about the reaction. Here it goes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: There is no classified material. I did not send classified material and I did not receive any material that was marked or designated classified. I did not e-mail any classified material to anyone on my e- mail. There is no classified material.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Rebuilding America Now is responsible for the content of this message.(EN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Frank Luntz is the CEO of Luntz Global. All right Frank, so what does it mean when it dipped? Did that mean they didn't like what she was saying or they didn't like the ad?FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER: Well they started zero and then they move second by second and what happened was they repeated the same line and that line became more and more powerful as it really sunk in. And the fact that the Hillary Clinton line was almost to 50 tells me that that ad cuts across partisan lines and political lines. The issue is...KELY: Yeah, because the Democrats were the low or as high as the Republicans and the Independents on that.LUNTZ: Exactly. It's an issue of credibility. And the fact is, if we're talking about Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton is winning. If we're talking about Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump is winning. And I don't think the Trump campaign fully understands that if this is a referendum not on him but on her, he'll be the next president. And yet all the conversation seems to be about him. You've got another couple ads to show. I mean, she is in real trouble if people see these ads.KELLY: Frank, what do you make of Karl Higbie's point in the last section which is, you know, we're at war with Islamic terrorists who want to kill us and decapitate us. You know, Syria is a hot mess. The country is having, you know, the Black Lives Matter Movement underscoring some serious issues and police feel under siege as well. And you know, we are spending a lot of time on whether Trump is a sexist, whether Hillary has berated women. Is this going to matter to voters?LUNTZ: It's going to matter only in that these undecided independent voters decide not based on policy, they've decided based on persona. And they're trying to decide which candidate can they trust and which candidate they want to let into their homes every day for four years. The point that was made is a good one, Megyn. You are correct, the public would rather decide based on policy and record.And when Donald Trump talks about the more than a quarter century that Hillary Clinton spent in Washington, D.C. and what was done, what was accomplished? Did we actually make this country stronger? The American people say no. But if it gets sidetracked by all the least circus -- side circus shows, then Trump will lose. It's up to him to control this debate.KELLY: What about he's hitting her for deplorables. Another thing that he did not bring up in the debate the other night. I'm sure we're going to hear it in the next debate. But he's got this ad whooping her for calling, you know, half his supporters deplorable. Do we have it? Let's watch. Standby, it's coming.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Speaking to wealthy donors Hillary Clinton calls tens of millions of Americans deplorable.CLINTON: You can put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. They're racists, sexists, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you name it.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: People like you...(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Effective?LUNTZ: That ad is going to add an extra 1 percent turnout to Donald Trump's vote because if you're insulted by your opponent, you're absolutely positive without any doubt whatsoever going to make it to the polls. That was a dumb comment that she's made and she will pay a price for it.KELLY: Trump was saying go meet with my depolrables (inaudible) deplorable are at my rally. Good to see you, Frank.LUNTZ: Pleasure. Thank you.KELLY: Well, conspiracy theorists set off a new round of controversy this week claiming that there is visual proof that Hillary Clinton used secret devices during Monday's presidential debate. Not an earpiece this time. Kilmeade is standing by to tell us what it is, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Well, there were no new collapse episodes for Hillary Clinton at the first presidential debate, but that did not stop a new round of conspiracy theories from going viral. From secret cough prevention machine because that exists, to a cheat-assisting ear piece. Brian Kilmeade is here to separate facts and fiction. He's co-host of ""Fox & Friends"" and host of ""Kilmeade & Friends"" on Fox News Radio.BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS FOX & FRIENDS CO-HOST: Right. Megyn, so here's the thing. One thing about when you think about Hillary Clinton, she's got answers. I guess the question is are they the right answers? So, a lot of people say she probably didn't need any help but what is that mysterious thing on her back? Do you see the line through her back?Do you see those arrows there that weren't there in the natural picture that was put there by John Madden (ph), and there, that little wire there? The question is, is it a Comtek RC-216 that cost $655 that would allow people to talk to her in another room. That's what the question is. It is something or could it be some type of cough suppressant? Could be a compressor machine kit which is a nebulizer that goes through $35.95, that can stop -- can stop and clear a barking (ph) issue for a short period of time.KELLY: It has like secret little nose pieces?KILMEADE: Right. It goes -- somehow it clears up your head before and maintains that clear nasal passage.KELLY: I got to get that whether she used that or not.KILMEADE: There's another question. Both of these things might not have happened.KELLY: You think?KILMEADE: This actually might have been just Hillary Clinton out there, but that is kind of strange. I've never dressed a woman but I don't know why...KELLY: So what is it? What is the...KILMEADE: Well, I don't know what that could be.KELLY: What did the campaign say?KILMEADE: The campaign says it's nothing. That's just the way it is.KELLY: Can we see the picture one more time?KILMEADE: I mean...KELLY: Demi Murphy (ph) who works for us says, I don't know about that thing at the bottom but that's her spine. It certainly looks like spine. The thing at the bottom is like, it could be something in her pocket?KILMEADE: It could be that. Here, it's going...KELLY: It does look like a mic pack. It looks a lot like a mic pack just like this, and just in case like the mic out there died or an IV pack which connects you to the -- OK, we got to move on because Gary Johnson said another really silly thing and that's being kind. Here he is with Chris Matthews.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC CORRESPONDETN: Who's your favorite foreign leader?GARY JOHNSON, LIBERTARIA PARTY CANDIDATE: Who's my favorite...MATTHEWS: Any, just name anywhere in the country, any one of the continents, any country. Name one foreign leader that you respect and look up to, anybody.JOHNSON: I guess I'm having an Aleppo moment in the former president...MATTHEWS: But I'm giving you the whole world.JOHNSON: I know. I know.MATTHEWS: Anybody in the world you like, anybody. Pick any leader.JOHNSON: The former president of Mexico.MATTHEWS: Which one?JOHNSON: I'm having a brain...MATTHEWS: Well, name anybody.(END VIDEO CLIP)KILMEADE: He said he smoked pot for four years and she stopped in 2008. He said he (inaudible) stopped smoking pot because he's running for president. I'm not convinced he has. And also they did a study, pot is out of your system in seven days. So, it does cause short term memory loss but if he's not smoking it, it shouldn't be a problem.KELLY: He should just have said any name like John (inaudible), right. Name that movie.(CROSSTALK)KILMEADE: Yes.KELLY: You got it. What's the movie?(CROSSTALK)KELLY: We'll be right back.KILMEADE: We'll go to commercial.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KILMEADE: In an effort to get young people to vote, Katy Perry has taken off her clothes. She believes that if people can just go naked and vote naked and Madonna can do the same thing, people will vote.KELLY: For who?KILMEADE: For who? I believe Hillary if I'm correct. Get dressed.KELLY: Bye.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.HOWARD KURTZ, HOST: Our buzz meter this Sunday its shock waves over the greatest media failure in modern political history. Failing to grasp with all of the talk about Hillary Clinton on the verge of victory and that the country would elect President Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)JOHN KING, CNN: We're having a conversation now that it was impossible to have two weeks ago. It was just improbable. You were not having a reality based conversation trying to do this map.JAKE TAPPER, CNN: It's just remarkable. I mean I don't think that we can over state this. Not only the Democrats and the Clinton campaign, not only pollster and the main stream media, but Republicans, did not anticipate that this night was going to be this way.CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS: I think we are all at least I am coming to the conclusion, to the conclusions of wrong word to open to the possibility. Donald Trump could be the next president of the United States.TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS: Let's be honest there's no one that I know that thought this three hours ago.DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT: To those that have chosen not to support me in the past, in which there were a few people. I am reaching out to you, for your guidance and your help, so that we can work together and unify our great country.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: Why did so many journalists underestimate the anger and frustration of Trump's voters? Why were the pundits and the pollster so spectacularly wrong? And the media was all in this narrative, and it was just everybody was marching and locked up. Clinton is going to win. Clinton is going to win. I am obsessed with our small band of partisan systematically be legitimize the main stream press and we just stood there and let it happen. And most of all, I am obsessed with how wrong and profoundly, historically, epically wrong we all got the election.Why are some liberal commentators blaming the press for not stopping Trump? That is not our job. Plus Donald Trump says that twitter helped him win the election. And can journalists now be fair to the President-elect? I am Howard Kurtz and this is ""MediaBuzz.""New York Times a published a truly extraordinary banner headlines after the election and here it is. Democrats, students and foreign allies faced the reality of the Trump presidency. The clear implication was that many people and the paper fine sympathetic remained shocked and even appalled by the prospect of President Trump. It's firstly impossible to imagine in such a times had long after Democratic victory, the paper editor and publisher now saying that perhaps Trump's sheer unconventionality lead them to underestimate his support in promising to be fair. This is some journalist and even some media critics, question how the news business so utterly botched this high stake election that so many expected Hillary Clinton to win.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VAN JONES, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: It's hard to be apparent tonight for a lot of us. You tell your kids don't be a bully. You tell your kids don't be a bigot. There are afraid of how do I explain these to my children.LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, MSNBC HOST: Donald Trump will take his place now among the racists who have lived in the White House.LAURA INGRAHAM, EDITOR IN CHIEF, LIFEZETTE: Everyone is emoting tonight and as my deceased mother would have said, suck it up butter cup. It's not fun to lose, but not everybody gets a trophy.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: All right. According to report on The Hill, under consideration for White House press secretary, joining us now to analyze the coverage of the election and its aftermath, Erin McPike a Political Commentator and former reporter for Real Clear Politics, Kristen Soltis Anderson, Washington Examiner Columnist and a Republican Strategist and Julie Roginsky, a Democratic Strategist and Fox News Contributor. Erin, the election is over and seems to me that there are still major elements in the media that are kind a have been hostile to President-elect Trump. What explain that?ERIN MCPIKE, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR FORMER REAL CLEAR POILITICS: I don't know what explain it but there's still obviously a lot of shock. You showed the New York Times headline from Thursday morning, but we continue to see headlines in the New York Times that is of resignation. I would point you to the Washington Post where the headlines are more of intrigued and openness to cover on what is to come. We even saw that Arthur Jr. put out this memo to readers on Friday, saying that we got it wrong and as you mentioned, they are still trying to figure it out but they haven't quite gotten there yet. We are seeing today, I looked through the pages of New York Times, not just the front page and they're doing stories now of what is actually going on in the Rustbelt. Where were the stories after he won the primary? Where were the country stories?KURTZ: Because the media consensus was a Rustbelt wasn't in play, Hillary Clinton had it locked up and here is a story in the New York Times and a new story, Kristen, from when he met with President Obama in the White House.Mr. Trump whose campaign whose support from white supremacist groups, sat in front of a bus with the reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., so the media risking their credibility with these kinds of news passages and headlines.KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, WASHINGTON EXAMINER COLUMNIST: There are a lot of places when you look at the election returns that voted for Obama quit heavily two elections in a row. Places like Luzern County and Pennsylvania that have now flip and become Trump country. These are not places that have been rejecting President Obama all along. These are for places that for economic reasons have changed their attitude and decided that Trump is the person who is most likely to.KURTZ: So why did the press not pick up on that during 18 months of campaign?SOLTIS ANDERSON: I think you know you saw in a lot of polls that you always had the white working class leaning towards Trump. What was miss was a lot of Princeton College educated white voters, etcetera, were breaking for Donald Trump, black voters, Latino voters, the exit polls suggest vote for Donald Trump in much higher margins that the polls would have suggested. So I think that is actually the group that the media missed. It was not the white working class so much, because we knew that they were going to go for Trump. It's a lot of white college educated professionals, African-American and Latinos, who voted for Trump and even though that the media said that was impossible.KURTZ: Julie it seems like some of the media just cannot come to grips right now, with the fact that Trump won. Why don't you think of that once you start with your own reaction when you came out of the train station here in Washington?JULIE ROGINSKY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I did, I came here yesterday and I went to the capital where I used to work and said I just can't believe it. And I think that a lot of people not just in the media, but Democrats like me and others are in disbelief. I will say and haven't thought about this, I think that the conclusion that I came to is people like, you know put the blame on myself as well as the media lives in an ivy tower. We live in Washington or we live in New York, we are not worried necessary about putting our kids through college, we can afford to do that. We're not worried so much about paying for health care, we can do that, we weren't worried so much about making our mortgage or rent payment. We can do that.We forgotten to our own affectionate is that there are people when I went on TV over the last four years and saying wait the economy is getting better, look at this metrics, there are white working class voters and not just white working class voters but as you pointed out, Latinos and African Americans and others said, maybe on paper it's getting better, but I can't pay my mortgage. They are saying it is greater that more people that have health care insurance, thanks to Obamacare, which I consistently cited, but I'm seeing more and more out of my pocket for those premiums and people like me forgot about those people.KURTZ: There is a phrase for that. It is called, the hour of touch and Erin, let me play for you the question that I asked you just this past Sunday, two days before the election.Erin, a number of pundits that came out two weeks ago and said that this race was over and done, Hillary is going to win, whose is going to be an the cabinet and no way that Trump can pull this thing off. Was that in retrospect reckless?You basically said that it was.MCPIKE: It was.KURTZ: So virtually all of the media were wrong, about Hillary Clinton winning this election. What does it say for the political headline and Trump needs a miracle. How do we now have the pundits coming out and saying that we're going to tell you what is going to happen in this thing that we said that it was not going to happen?MCPIKE: What do you mean they're going to say what's going to happen in a Trump presidency?KURTZ: Yeah.MCPIKE: We always need to cover what's going to happen over the next 70 days and actually cover what Trump is going to do and start asking him those questions. Going back to some of the points, I think that there is laziness in leaning on the polls versus actually covering what is going on the country. You and I, Howard have talked for a long time about how many news organizations are shutting down bureaus and not getting out in the country. This is a moment for the news organizations to go back and reopen the Chicago bureaus and staff them up. And actually go out into the country and report on what it is that people are talking about and what they want?KURTZ: How about the bureau in Detroit? And you know, journalists who are trying to say will Donald Trump has a bigger path than people realize and we played a clip last week and lecturing mark helper and who wasn't saying that Trump was going to win but he hears how he can get it interesting. You're being too optimistic. Well it turns out, Halpen was right, so even when the data were there, they were a sort of a group thing about it and it was not right.SOLTIS ANDERSON: Well, there were some states that it was a group thing problem, so for instance, in the state of Pennsylvania, the polls only showed Clinton with a slim lead in Pennsylvania, but the narrative was, well Pennsylvania is always loosely with this stuff, all right. Republican always thinks they can win Pennsylvania but they can't. So there, it was people misreading the data. But there are others states, I mean Wisconsin, the polls were off by over six points and in the state like Michigan, the polls were off by three to that Ohio the polls off by five points. The polling errors were not uniformed across the country. Some like New Hampshire, Virginia were perfect, but it was just the right combination of state that led people to think there were pieces that were completely off the board, especially in the upper Midwest, and if you actually consider the states in play, then suddenly you're 80 percent projection for Clinton and it has to become much more even.KURTZ: A lot of changes now in the media, for example McCory Lewandowski, Trump's first campaign manager, resigning from CNN. He had been a commentator like to go in to the Trump administration. Let me put up on the screens for you, the cover of people magazine. took so much heat over this and including from Hollywood celebrities It's kind of a standard post election coverage, you see it, they are President Trump, beside with him, photo's spread dealing with Trump and so forth. The magazine took so much heat over this. Including from Hollywood celebrities and said we are not going to get interviews, we are going to boycott. But the there had to put out a statement saying this isn't a celebration, it is a news story.ROGINSKY: Well, he is right, it is a news story. What I find interesting about People Magazine as they had their own reporter saying that Donald Trump had assaulted her.KURTZ: Yes, former people reporter said this happens a decade. It does not change the allegations.ROGINSKY: It does not change that at all, but I find it interesting the same editors that came to her defense are now putting it out. I think there is a little congruity here. What I find interesting to some extent is that there's been from the media, now is People Magazine specifically, but there has been a way of covering for example Hillary Clinton that now that I hope the same kind of attention turns to Donald Trump. For example like the conflict within the Trump organization and their finances and what President Trump will do. Something like that is very important for the media to focus on.KURTZ: What is he supposed to do? Just like pretend that he did not win the election? Not have a headline about President Trump?ROBERTS: No, they should cover it but cover it as specifically.KURTZ: Who is in the cover?SOLTIS ANDERSON: Here is the thing about People Magazine, when we are reporters you very much want your editors to have your back. You want them to stick up for you. When you write a story and someone says, that is not true. You can't ever believe that in any gossip stuff that you get into or any serious event that is she did, that they're going to up end their entire editorial mission. Most magazines that are in this country are going to put the president-elect on the cover. That is just a fact. They cannot have it (inaudible).KURTZ: Let me get to, you know everyone knows the anti-Trump protest in major cities around the country and Trump rallies and people are up by tweeting that this is being incited by the media and I don't know if that is true, but the question is 15 million follower came up in an interview tonight in CBS 60 minutes, Lesley start asking him whether as President, will he continue to -- be quite so desirous on Tweeter. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: When you give me a bad story or when you give me an in accurate story or someone other than you and the network or whatever and of course CBS would never do it, though they do it, but I have a method of fighting back. That is very tough.LESLEY STAHL, CBS NEWS: You're going to do that as president?TRUMP: I'm going to do very restrain, if I use it at all. I am going to be very restrained.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: The importance of Twitter and do you believe President Trump will be very restrained?MCPIKE: I think Donald Trump has uncovered that people are interested in getting their information straight from the source, straight from the candidate rather than through the filtered or perhaps the media. And I think, you know, a lot of the folks that are going to criticize him and I maybe well one of him for not being traditionally presidential. I think what we need to realized is that for a lot of people, traditionally presidential being very restrained on something like twitter is not necessarily what they voted for. That the concept of what is presidential can change.KURTZ: Julie, this did not last that long, because this morning the real Donald Trump tweets wow, New York Times is losing thousands of subscribers because of their poor and very and highly in accurate coverage of the Trump phenomenon. So he is back to whacking the media.ROGINSKY: Yeah, that is what we need from the president. I think he has to understand that when the president speaks, the markets are moved and foreign policies get made. These are not things that should be done in a vacuum based in 140 character tweets that the president tweets out. You have to give a little thought and not in the middle of the night about tweeting out something that you are upset about.KURTZ: When the president tweets, speaks or tweets. All right, let me get a break and let us know what you think. Stick to the mediabuzz@foxnews.com.When we come back Hillary Clinton campaign chief says one of the reasons that she lost was the press was against her and later Sharyl Attkinson, on the media bias and the election outcome and the coming coverage of the Trump administration.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: By the way the New York magazine is going to retract the loser coverage? Can you retract a cover? Turns out to the Hillary Clinton campaign is also charging media bias, now that she lost the election. Everyone expected her to win. Kristen and in a conference call with donors yesterday widely reported by the media, Hillary Clinton's top by FBI Chief James Comey, renewing that investigation and to the e-mails.RNL saying that Comey letter rising doubts that were groundless and baseless, proven to be, stop our momentum, says Hillary Clinton. Now we will never know what would have happened. Could it be said that the saturation coverage of Comey's renewed investigation did change the atmosphere?MCPIKE: She was already falling in the polls before the Comey letter. And frankly, I mean, if you asked about anything in this last two weeks, that would have change the voters mind, I think something like the affordable care acts premium announcement, is going to have much more on effect on someone's pocketbook than the rehashing of the debate over the e-mails that we have already been having for a months. So I think the idea that sop her momentum, I have a lot of questions about that.KURTZ: Fair enough. I think it is her media momentum, that was the story for days and now Julie, John Podesta and the former campaign chairman for Clinton said according to The Hill on different conference call, the media always covered her as a person who would be president and therefore tried to the advice rate her before the election, but covered Trump as someone who was entertaining and sort of gave him a pass. Is that a pass?ROGINSKY: Well I think and this is due to Trump and not the media started to normalize some of the comments whether about the judge or the woman or anything else.KURTZ: What do you mean when you say the media is normalized?ROBERTS: Because when you have, let's remember, Mitt Romney had that battered women comment and then the 48 percent, everybody went ballistic. It was one mishap, right? Trump has so many time and time again. It almost became normalized. It almost become anything and not one became crazy and something that was had them happened that people, because so many of them happened, but people were starting to get used to it.I will say, look I think that people voted for the hope and change in 2008 and those same people voted for hope and change now. People were promised the height of the great recession that their pocketbooks were going to be fuller and they are not going to be paying as much for health care as it pointed out, and it did not happen. You cannot say that people that voted for Trump are all racists or bigots or anything else. A lot of them were Obama voters and voted for the same thing.KURTZ: You cannot say that even thou some have been saying that. We will talk about that later in the program. Also interesting that Donald Trump is saying that he may preserve some elements of Obama care particularly banned on pre-existing conditions and allowing young people on 26 to stay on the parent's policy. In which, some people could say always changing is my old President-elect go through this and they have to reconcile, they made promises with reality. But in that Podesta conversation, he said that he was talking about what they do is the old coverage of the email scandal versus Donald Trump business conflicts, didn't release his tax returns, but does the Clinton camp really believe that the media was not aggressive enough toward Donald Trump?SOLTIS ANDERSON: They may. I think that the bigger problem that the Clinton campaign had is how they were covered, because some people just saying in a blanket fashion that the media is maybe anti-Trump. But they certainly won in the tank for Hillary Clinton and the reason that I would point to on that, is that over the course of these campaign the media was on the activist mission to get Hillary Clinton to apologize for everything whether it was the e-mails, whether it is Benghazi, whether it is her husband in the past, it was all these activist mission and it was very strange rather than covering what you would actually do, and I think you that is why Podesta (inaudible).KURTZ: Her own top advisers said that she had a path lodge logical inability to apologize, but at the same time some of this WikiLeaks disclosure, whether it is Donna Brazile leaking CNN questions at advance, other journalist closing up with the Clinton campaign mad a lot of people think that the press was not on attack for Hillary Clinton and starting to be very sympathetic to her.MCPIKE: Well, if you take a look Donald has been asking this question over for the last number of decades. Do you think that the presidential candidates are they talking about issues that mattered to you? Is that what you hear when you tuned in to the media and you see what it being discussed. We hit record lows in this campaign and I place a lot of blame on, for instance the Clinton campaign for that?KURTZ: Do you place the blame on the media which was constantly distracted, you know by access Hollywood and all kinds of accusations?MCPIKE: I would have loved to see more covers of the issue. But you know what, people knew that Donald Trump wanted to build a wall, renegotiate trade deals and he made very clear on what he wanted to do. Hillary Clinton had a basket of about 5,000 things that she would talk about variously. And I think that was hard for any one message to break through that.KURTZ: All right. We're going to leave it there, Julie Roginsky, Kristen Soltis Anderson and Erin McPike, thanks very much for stopping by this Sunday. Ahead Frank Luntz has some brand new polling on how the Americans view the coverage of the election.But first some ugly stuff for the liberal commentators, I mentioned this earlier, which is still rallying against Donald Trump. His voters have the press.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: I understand that liberal commentators are upset that Donald Trump has just won the White House. What I don't understand is why they are still saying ugly things in a way for re-elections.(Inaudible) is Chief Correspondence and an African- American who wrote last night that Donald Trump is not going to be president and re-tweeted after the election results I did quite not understand how much white people hated us. What? Many white voters help get Barack Obama two terms. CNN Commentator Van Jones is a former Obama White House aide said this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JONES: We have not talked about race. This was a ""whitelash."" That was a whitelash against a changing country. It was a whitelash against a black president in part.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: A ""whitelash"" because your candidate lost. It is fine to be critical of Trump. But he did spend time reaching out to the black community. And then there is guy, I respect media critic, Jeff Jarvis, who has a graduate journalist program at the city of University of New York. He said that journalism seems broken, tweeting, ""My profession failed to inform the public about the fascist they are electing.""Did you miss so much negative stuff the press dump on Trump? Driver also call the outcome again, ""The victory of the uneducated and uninformed."" Sorry it is really unattractive if you call voters dumb, because you don't agree with their decision.Gabriel Prominent Author really went off, ""America died on November 8, 2016, not with a bang or a whimper, but at its own hand via electoral suicide. We will brace for the violence, the anger, the racism, the misogyny, the xenophobia, the nativism, the white sense of grievance will undoubtedly be unleash now,""Pretty scary stuff and then what about Director Aaron Sorkin, his heroes are usually preachy liberals like Martin Sheen on the West Wing, a program I really like. In a letter to his daughter N.Y. posted by Vanity Fair, Sorkin wrote, ""This is truly horrible. It is the first time that a thoroughly incompetent pig with dangerous ideas, a serious psychiatric disorder, and no knowledge of the world and no curiosity to learn has. And it wasn't just Donald Trump who won last night. It was his supporters too. The Klan won last night, white nationalist, sexist, racist and buffoons.""The Klan won? That might be played on the TV drama but it is a letter, just seem angry and over rot. Aren't liberals supposed to support tolerance and unity? Wouldn't they have been furious if Hillary had won and conservatives kept trashing her? You could still fight for your beliefs, but perhaps you should follow President Obama lead and be a bit more gracious toward the guy who won.Coming up one of the leading never Trumper's Rich Lowry and a former Democratic spokesman face off over the coverage of this election and later Sharyl Attkisson and some stunning negative headlines greeting President- Elect Trump.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: The election maybe over but some of the media are still furious, perhaps a bit shell shocked at the outcome and that includes conservative common commentators who win the never Trump camp and Liberal commentator who are in I can't even imagine this guy is president camp.Joining us now in New York is Rich Lowry, Editor of National Review and Fox News Contributor, and here in Washington Mo Elleithee, Executive Director of Georgetown University Institute of Politics, a one time Democratic Spokesperson and now also a brand new Fox News Contributor. Welcome gentlemen. Rich, you famously put out an issue on National Review, against Trump and you have been pretty steadfast in opposing him, and now you have mixed feelings about Donald Trump becoming president.RICH LOWRY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, the against Trump issue was in the primaries and in the general election we never got on board the Trump train, but the coverage of Hillary Clinton was much harsher. Every cover we ran about the presidential race and the general election was an anti- Hillary cover.I am not sure if any news organization out there had more harsh coverage and incisively coverage of the email controversies in the coming investigation than we did. But yeah, I was surprised as anyone. I wrote that he would win the thing. I could see him getting to 260 electoral votes, but I had a lot of trouble seeing him getting him over the top. He did it. My hats off to him, and now we are hoping for the best.KURTZ: You had a lot of company in that regard. Now, Trump, not only running against the main stream press but ran against you and National Review and The Weekly Standards and Bill Kristol and Cloud Hammer and Jonah, does his victory undercut you a bit in terms of who now defines conservatism within the Republican Party?LOWRY: Yeah, so in the party now we have this enormous populous wing, most people would have thought there was a chance that even existed a year ago. And the populous control the conservatives control congress and if they can get it together, they is a chance to do a lot of good. But the populous clearly had it with him. Because you always want to control the White House and you look at how the course of the national history and that is been more common that we have had uncomfortable and awkward relationships with Republican presidents rather than hand and glove relationships. Really the only exception would be Ronald Reagan. When have problems with him at times, but when Trump is right, and he going to hit on all sides, will be among his fiercest defenders, when he is wrong, we will have the independent to call him out and try to correct him.KURTZ: OK. Liberal commentators like yourself on your estimate. Donald Trump has over estimated the appeal of Hillary Clinton.MO ELLEITHEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE OF POLITICS: Well, look I think that I also have been eating a lot of query. I thought back in the spring, during the primaries, when we saw what is going on, I thought that a lot of Democrats were underestimating his potential. I thought there was a path for him that he could win, but like Rich has said like a lot of other people did not think that it was likely. I think one of the problems that too many of us had was that we were too busy looking at this election through an old paradigm, looking at it through the paradigm of left versus right, looking at it through the paradigm of the two candidates and did not spend enough time looking at what was happening around the country and this populace wave that swept.KURTZ: I would say that the media by and large were guilty with that.ELLEITHEE: That is right.KURTZ: Especially looking back, now, when CNN Van Jones said that the election was a white lash against the black president and when (inaudible) said I did not realize how much white people hate us, is that adding to the divisiveness of the country?ELLEITHEE: Look, I believe that again and I was wrong before, but I believe that there was this incredibly strong, unheard voice in Middle America that saw Donald Trump as the vehicle to be heard. It turns out that much of that voice was blue collar and was white. What we need to be careful about is pitting that voice against the Democratic Coalition, against African American and Hispanics, and I think the left and Democrats are going to have to go moving forward and figure out how to bridge these two different constituencies once again, because of just taking one side against another.KURTZ: Let me get Rich back in, when terms like white lash, Barack Obama, I remember was not on the ballot this time, do you think that some in the media are going too far in defining these election and strictly and even harshly racial terms?LOWRY: Of course. And it's what always happen, it is very blind and it is completely wrong and it was pointed out early in the program, that one of the key swing votes in this election was working class voters, who have voted for Obama in 2012 and we want for Trump this time. They did not all of a sudden become hideous racist in the course of four years. And I think it is very important for folks on the left to try to extend a little bit more sympathetic understanding to this working class rather than having contempt for them and Mo is exactly right, you know you can appeal to both sides. There used to be Democratic politician who really tried to do that, like Bill Clinton, but just this time around both the Democratic Party and the media just seem to think that there was something wrong inherently and in even trying to have an appeal to this voters.KURTZ: And I am hearing some commentators on your side now, talk about sexism and that Hillary Clinton could not get there as opposed to all of the other reasons that we talked about, she didn't visit Michigan until the very end, and emails, and everything else and that she could not get there because she is a woman. Does that seem simplified?ELLEITHEE: I think it's a bit over simplified. I'm not saying that isn't inherent sexism in many ways, but I don't think that does not define these election. What I will say though is whether we're talking about racism or sexism, I believe that we got to try to bridge the gap and we shouldn't over play that, but having said that, it's important to realize that the rhetoric that Donald Trump used throughout the elections did scare and alienate millions of American in a lot of these groups. And so, there is still that voice that needs to be heard. I hope that the president-elect, just as Democrat, I think they need to reach out and try to be heard by the white blue collar voters. He has to begin do his part to mend the divide with the people who are scared.KURTZ: Well, I have a half of a minute. I mean Donald Trump wins against the press Wall Stripes, middle left and center, do you think that was a factor in his victory?LOWRY: Yeah, it was. Republicans always complain about the press and often times it just comes off of blinding. I think it had more impact this time, because the bias is more obvious one and two it fit into these generalize theme that Trump had that was very powerful and that the system was rigged and our institutions are failing us and the press is still incredibly bias. And if Trump supporters were out in the thousands after Hillary Clinton victory and breaking things and smashing windows, and turning things to cops, it would be the front page news and there would be a tsunami of criticism throughout the media and we're hearing none of that, about these anti-Trump protestors.KURTZ: I can't disagree with that. And on that point Rich Lowry, Mo Elleithee, thanks very much for joining us.Ahead on the ""MediaBuzz,"" why do the mainstream media, just now own up to the bias and misleading coverage that barred the much of this campaign? Sharyl Attkisson, on why it was obvious all along, and later, the late night comics choking on Donald Trump's victory.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Your watch maybe over but some of the media remain really angry about the billionaire republican who just won the White House. New York's Daily News which ridiculed Donald Trump as a clown and a dummy throughout the campaign. House of horror, you can see the White House, Salon, The misogyny apocalypse, The New Yorker Magazine, An American Tragedy. Editor David Remnick saying Donald Trump's victory is a triumph for the forces of the nativism, misogyny and racism.Joining us now is an old friend of the show Sharyl Attkisson the host of Full Measure, airing on Sunday morning and Sinclair Television Station and author of the upcoming book The Smear. So for a year and half, you were among the few voices that were saying don't underestimate Donald Trump, don't write him off and don't minimize his appeal and now you have a lot of journalist coming out and saying, boy we got it wrong, we blew it.SHARYL ATTKISSON, FULL MEASURE HOST: I think part of that because I'm not a political insider and I was not looking at the polls for my results and predictions. I was listening to ordinary people and anecdotes traveling the country and asking my friends liberals and conservatives and those who are in between and it was pretty clear to me as I predicted that Trump would win or would likely win.KURTZ: Yeah. Well, do you think that this kind of a group that sets in a situation like this and everyone that a journalist knows is against Trump and everyone on the twitter feed is mocking Trump and perhaps in many cases reinforced by their own personal bias that this guy, who never held political office was not fit for the White House?ATTKISSON: Absolutely. You put the finger on it. And I think that in a big picture to me, the media had allowed itself, we had allowed our self to be infiltrated by the political operatives, meaning we hired them, we welcome them into our news room and they work in the news department, they shape coverage, they work as managers and that is one reason why I think that you had a whole rash of news outlets actually trying to overtly and admit they were doing this and convince people who to vote for rather than just bring the facts and report on the campaign.KURTZ: Don't you think that viewers on all the networks who see the political commentators and many of them, you know two days from the previous campaign on the right or left know that these are partisans and do not view them or do they view them is kind a like we are all a bunch of insiders and grew up in journalism and grew up in politics?ATTKISSON: I think they see everybody sort of an insider's, there is a market for that. Clearly some people want to hear that sort of coverage that is given in the campaign, but someone tweeted to me there are more of us who think for our self than they are of you who try to tells us what to think, I kind a sum it up.KURTZ: Sharyl, I want to see the editors and journalists and even New York Times media columnists say that Trump is such a different, such a dangerous character in their view of potentially dangerous. We have to suspend our usual standards and cover him differently more aggressively than Hillary Clinton, who is , you know career politician, former cabinet member and then you see this USA poll by nearly ten to one, people said the media wanted Hillary Clinton to win and that included three quarters of Clinton supporters. So people are getting it.ATTKISSON: Yeah, and because they had admitted it, there is always been a subtext or belief that the media is in on it sometimes, but they really came out in the USA today for the first time in a 34 year history saying that they were going to weigh in on a presidential campaign, don't vote for Trump. The New York Times, the header which I think was a particularly remarkable according to my information and there was a lot of information about stories that they could have done in Hillary Clinton that in a neutral sense a news organization would have done and yet they made the decision to hold or withhold those stories. Things like that have really cut into what credibility the media has.KURTZ: And speaking of that, I mean you have been in this embarrassing performance and there is really no other word for it. Do you think the press will learn some lessons in the future, particularly when it comes to sort of getting out of the New York and Washington bubble?ATTKISSON: Not really.KURTZ: You're not optimistic.ATTKISSON: Little. The same people who made this decisions which I think in many of us is particularly bad and agreed to decisions. When a journalist stand point cannot be relied upon either to fix their own problems or to correctly and accurately predict and report on things in the future. This is a huge problem.KURTZ: Do you think that part of it is a sort of a cultural or social pressure where to sort of break from the pack and when you have people that maps and data and polls and saying that there's no way that Donald Trump is going to win and you pick off all these groups and he lost the debate and do they come out and say no, few did it and there's a chance and here is why. Do you think that there's that kind of pressure?ATTKISSON: Absolutely. If you're someone and a lot of people in the press believe it or not, are group thinkers and they are in that crab mentality. If that is you, you are not going to be comfortable position, providing another analysis. You and I are not like that, we talked about this. The pressure that you feel and when you simply report the facts what you think you see, it's not the personal opinion of what you want to see happen, but it's treated like that, now your bias, because you're off the page and off the narrative and different than us. I don't mind being different from other people, but I think a lot of people are uncomfortable in that position.KURTZ: It is not always easy, Sharyl Attkisson, great to see you, looking forward to your book.ATTKISSON: Thank you.KURTZ: After the break, some brand new polling done for this program on the media and the election and Donald Trump. Frank is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: So many failures to exam in the wake of Donald Trump upset victory among pundits, but also among pollsters, joining us from Los Angeles is Frank Luntz the veteran pollster and Fox News Contributor. Frank, you have a brand new post Election Day poll and I put the numbers here, founded 54 percent of those serving find the media coverage election bias, 46 percent said fair, and 39 percent said that it was anti-Trump and then that is a t but look at this, fair to each candidate 39 percent of the coverage was Anti-Trump, 31 percent have the coverage is Poll Clinton as a total of 70 percent.On the other side only 16 percent says pro-Trump, 14 percent say Anti- Clinton, what is your take away.FRANK LUNTZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Full understood what was happening in this election and I think, listen to your previous guest, that they were correct that Donald Trump running against the media, was an effective strategy, it upset the reporters. I was on Trump's plane or the media plane, the day before the election and the reporters were used to it by that point. They were used to being a focal point of Donald Trump's criticism. But for those who didn't want Washington to control their live, it was an effective strategy.One more thing Howie, what I found interesting was in the exit polls when we studied why they were so wrong in state after state after state, it's because Trump voters refused to participate. It's not that they lied, it is not that they changed their information when they were filling out the ballot, it's that they said I don't want to do this, I don't want to help the media or I don't want to help the establishment, I'm not going to take that poll. No one knew that it was that deep and that passionate until Election Day and this is going to continue well into the administration.KURTZ: Yeah, polls often have a trouble measuring passion. Hillary Clinton we should say did win or is winning the popular vote, but that is not how you are going to like the president, you got to get to 270.You made a little news on Election Day with an interview with Yahoo. Let me play a little bit of that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LUNTZ: Starting tonight on this show, no one will call me a Republican again, because I'm not part of this. I'm not part of that system. I'm not part of that negativity.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: You go way back, you worked with Newt Gingrich in 1994. What do you mean no one will call you a Republican again?LUNTZ: Because it's not appropriate, because I've tried over the last two years to tell it straight. I did this on ""60 minutes,"" I did it for the ""New York Times,"" I did it for ""Time"" magazine. Trying to - and for the BBC, trying to be correct, trying to be accurate and not taking a point of view. And for you to label me, for the media to label me a Republican is not proper. There are some people who come out like James Carville, who is always going to take the Democratic perspective and there is some people who come on, who always take the Republican perspective. My job is to be accurate and to be precise and to not take any side and I've had it with this labeling, because we know.KURTZ: Well, you've had a lot of Republican clients over the years. I think that is part of the labeling. But you also said in that interview we just played, that you're not part of the negativity, so the impression I got is that you were not happy with the way Donald Trump ran his campaigning and you didn't want to be associated with that either.LUNTZ: I was not happy with the entire tone, I was not happy with the debates, because there wasn't enough substance. It was all about personality. I was not happy with the advertising. The Chris Wallace debate was the exception. The Chris Wallace debate actually showed people that could you have a real conversation and you could understand what the candidates were coming from. And he deserves tremendous kudos. But Howard, for the most part, this campaign was the most negative of anything I've experienced in the 30 years that I've been doing it and there has to be a way for people to unite, there has to be common ground. If you really want to get tax reform, if you really want to get an anti-poverty program, if you really want the U.S. to re-establish itself in the world order, then you're going to have to work across the aisle to get that situation on.KURTZ: Let me just give you one more question, you said that in an essay in Time magazine, Frank that you were shocked by the outcome, that there was an echo chamber in the media and political establishment, that certainly guy like Trump could never win. Did you fall prey to the echo chamber like a lot of people?LUNTZ: I absolutely thought, when I saw the exit polls and they had a plus five, plus six in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio is dead even, Florida, Clinton had the lead, I was sure Clinton was going to win. And your exit poll, they were Fox News exit polls and it was clear to win. I have no doubt, base on the exit polls. And there were your exit poll, they were Fox News exit polls and it was clear. And then when the election is over, what happen? And then I was as stunned as anybody. But then you accept that, you acknowledge your mistake, you learn from it and then you move forward. And Howard, we got to find a way to move forward where it is about all of us together rather than about winners and losers. And I think that is going to be a very important theme that I'll be pushing between now and Election Day.KURTZ: A good closing statement, Frank Luntz, great to see you, from Los Angeles.Still to come, the late night comics who savaged Donald try to come to grips with President Trump.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: It was no joking matter but nearly all of the late night comics were vehemently opposed to Donald Trump. So while they managed a few jokes after election night, most of them were, well, pretty bummed.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEPHEN COLBERT, THE LATE SHOW HOST: This is what it feels like when America is made great again. I was wondering, and I was really hoping it would feel better because this sucks!SETH MEYERS, THE LATE NIGHT SHOW HOST: As a whites man, I also know that any emotions that I'm feeling are likely a fraction of those being felt by the LGBTQ community, African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Muslim Americans. I'm hopeful that he is not actually a racist and then he just used racist rhetoric to court voters.JIMMY KIMMEL, JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE HOST: No matter how you feel, Donald Trump is the president of United States of America, so thank god we legalized marijuana yesterday.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I know for a woman as a woman, it feels so sexist and I think I guess the message that I want to like spread out to other women is exactly what you're saying, not to give up -- sorry. I hate (BEEP).(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Only Jimmy Fallon who took some heat, because he only joked around with Trump during the campaign, remember when he pulled Trump's hair, struck the same tone.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JIMMY FALLON, THE TONIGHT SHOW: Republicans hope that he will keep his promise to build a wall and Democrats hope he'll keep his promise not to accept the election results.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Well, the night time community are entitled to get serious and if they were that deeply affected by Trump's victory, but a big chunk of their audience just voted the other way and they might keep that in mind over the next four years.That is it for this post election edition of ""MediaBuzz.""

3	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/06/17/huckabee-obama-has-been-deadly-wrong-about-isis/	Huckabee: Obama has been 'deadly wrong' about ISIS	"This is a rush transcript from ""Your World,"" June 17, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.TRISH REGAN, GUEST HOST:  Well, there's a new poll right now showing Americans are pretty much split on what to label the Orlando massacre; 48 percent of Americans right now look at it as an Islamic terror attack; 41 percent, however, look at it as an act of domestic gun violence.  Reaction now from former Arkansas Governor and Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee.  Governor, good to see you.Are you surprised at these numbers?  MIKE HUCKABEE, R-FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Not really.  No, I'm not surprised, Trish, because America's divided.  And keep in mind that a lot of what America hears from the mainstream media is an overemphasis oh, oh, we need gun control, gun control, gun control. But we -- it wasn't guns that killed people at the Boston Marathon.  I think sometimes people forget that the common denominator in a terroristic attack is not the weapon.  It's a person with intent.  And whether it's a shoe or a bomb stuffed in underwear, whether it's a pressure cooker, a gun, no matter what the weapon is, a knife, the common denominator is not the weaponry.  The common denominator is a radicalized Islamic jihadist who is going to use whatever instrumentation possible to kill us.  REGAN:  All right, so let's follow that up for a minute, though, and just ask the question.  Look, this is a guy who had been investigated multiple times by the FBI for terrorism.  HUCKABEE:  Yes.  REGAN:  This is a guy who is watching all kinds of jihadi propaganda on his mobile devices, and this is a guy whose father had sworn allegiance to the Taliban.  In other words, how does a guy with that kind of profile, Governor, how does he get his hands on weapons?  HUCKABEE:  Well, Trish, what I have said is that this whole case has had more red flags than a Chinese military parade.  And the sad thing is that the flags didn't seem to catch enough attention to keep a better eye on this guy.  Now, I understand the FBI not may not have had enough to arrest, but they then took their eyes off of himAnd the fact is, we have had a Justice Department -- I'm not blaming the FBI.  I want to be very clear.  But I blame a politicized Justice Department under both Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch who have spent more time investigating people like James Rosen and wiretapping his phone and that of his parents than they have of paying attention to these kind of people.  REGAN:  And that's the reality.HUCKABEE:  And that ought to be of great concern.REGAN:  Right?  We need to be more vigilant.  But, by the same token, should there be some give on behalf of the NRA? Should the NRA say, yes, OK, we agree.  If you're being investigated for terror, or if you have been investigated for terror -- and, by the way, this guy never, ever, ever, ever should have been cleared -- but if you're on that list, you're not going to be able to get a gun, period, end of story?HUCKABEE:  Well, I think that there could be something like that, but here is the thing.  We have to know how that list is comprised.  If it's comprised because somebody just said, you know what, I think old Bob Smith ought to be on the list, but there's no due process and he is not notified and he's not given a chance to clear his name, then the government could use that list.  What if they put me on the list?  I'm pretty sure I'm not real popular with this administration.  They might put me on that list for political reasons.REGAN:  Well, to your point, yes, you have got to be very careful with the list.  HUCKABEE:  Absolutely.  Yes.  REGAN:  But I guess the reason why so many Americans are saying this is about gun control, they're just wondering how the heck a guy with terrorist sympathies, who was clearly a ticking time bomb, was able to go and purchase what he purchased and do the damage he did.  And so, in some ways, it's kind of a mixture.  Nonetheless, Governor Huckabee, I think we can pretty be assured that the left is going to try and make this about more than just ISIS, because it's to their political benefit to do so.  I mean, let's face it.  ISIS was created under this president, and he is going to have to bear the cross of that.  HUCKABEE:  Yes.  Well, and he has also claimed that he has contained ISIS and it was a J.V. team.  So, everything he has tried to project about it has been so incredibly and -- now let's just be blunt -- deadly wrong.  And the left is embarrassed, because they never thought that they would see their own approach to Islamic radicalism totally unravel.  And it has.  And they're trying to defend and protect the nation, really, I guess the reputation of Islam, even more than they're trying to protect Americans. And that ought to be a concern.  I don't care what your political persuasion is.REGAN:  Yes.  No, we saw that just the other day in the press conference that the president gave, where he seemed more angry, Governor, at Republicans than he did the terrorists.  HUCKABEE:  Yes.  REGAN:  And that really shows you just exactly how politicized this environment has gotten.  And none of that is good.  I mean, really, if you're going to fight terror, do you or do you not need to take the politics out of it?  HUCKABEE:  You do.  And you need to be angry at the right person, at the right time, for the right cause.And this president, as you pointed out, was visibly angry at Republicans and specifically Donald Trump.  You could see the veins bulging on his neck.  And he spoke with far more passion about we're going to get these Republicans than he ever did when he goes to the podium and says we're going to go to war with ISIS and we're going to kill the last one of them, and they will never be able to come out of little hidey-holes ever again.

BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  My number one priority in the coming two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our president-elect is successful.

WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel which Trump we'll see, the blustery candidate or the disciplined president?All, right now, on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  And hello again from Fox News in Washington.  After pulling off one of the biggest stunners in the history of American politics, Donald Trump is now moving quickly to fill his administration and pursue his agenda.  In a moment, we'll speak with Kellyanne Conway, senior advisor to the Trump transition.  And later with one of the top Republicans in Congress, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy.  But, first, let's bring in Doug McKelway with the latest from Trump Tower in New York City -- Doug.  DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Chris.  Outside of Trump Tower, things are calm this morning after a fourth day and night of protests.  The entire block is ringed with heavy security and blocked off to traffic with police barricades.  These kinds of security precautions will remain in effect until January 21st, after Inauguration Day.  Meanwhile, inside, the transition team continues its furious around the clock pace.  The team is headed up by Vice President-elect Mike Pence.  It includes three of Trump's adult children, Ivanka, Donald Jr., and Eric, as well as his son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as other trusted advisors.  They've got to fill more than 4,000 jobs and they have only nine weeks to do it.  Campaign chief Kellyanne Conway yesterday indicated that the choice of chief of staff is all but made and speculation is rampant that it's going to be RNC Chairman Reince Priebus.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP SENIOR ADVISOR:  It's imminent.  REPORTER:  Today?CONWAY:  No, but it's imminent.I think Chairman Priebus has expressed interest in the position.  There are several people being considered.  And it's Mr. Trump's decision ultimately.  (END VIDEO CLIP)MCKELWAY:  As you might recall, Trump showered praise on Priebus on election night.  That could be a sign that he may be just too valuable an asset to pass up.  The chief of staff job widely regarded as the second most important job in the White House, serving as gatekeeper to the president.  And to that point now Trump's team reflects a cadre of competing interests, Pence on one hand seen as sober minded, a social conservative with deep Washington ties, while firebrand Breitbart publisher Steven Bannon is known for his take-no-prisoners attitude and has been deeply critical of establishment Washington types.  It all raises questions of whether Trump might go for staffers who are willing to work within the byzantine bureaucracy of Washington or staffers who might want to blow it all up.Chris, back to you.  WALLACE:  Doug McKelway, reporting from Trump Tower -- Doug, thanks for that.Joining us now live from Fox News in New York, Kellyanne Conway, one of Trump's top transition advisors.  Kellyanne, let's start with the president's agenda and whether he will keep the promises he made on the campaign trail.  In his first interview as president-elect, Mr. Trump told the ""Wall Street Journal,"" either Obamacare will be amended or repealed and replaced.  Kellyanne, I have to tell you I never heard him talk once on the campaign trail about amending Obamacare.  CONWAY:  Well, as you know the house and Senate under Republican control, Chris, has repealed Obamacare dozens of times, but they never had a Republican president to go the next step.  I think he's -- Mr. Trump has made very clear what his healthcare plan would look like and it would not look like the Affordable Care Act and Obamacare.  It would do what Obamacare doesn't do: let you buy health insurance across state lines the way you can buy auto insurance and other goods and services.  It would block grant Medicaid to the states.  It would create health savings accounts to individuals, which is a very free market solution that works in the private sector in many places.  So -- and he would also get rid of the Obamacare penalty practically on day one through his tax reform.  He also has talked about convening a special session on January 20th after he is sworn in as president of the United States to do this very thing, to repeal and replace Obamacare.  It would be a pretty remarkable move.  So, what you see with Donald Trump is what you get, and I believe that's why the voters gave him this election and this mandate.  WALLACE:  I want to get back to this question of whether he's going to repeal it or amend it, because Mr. Trump said that one of the reasons for his possible shift away from repeal was his meeting with President Obama.  Here is what Mr. Trump told The Journal: ""I told him,"" the president, ""I will look at his suggestions and out of respect I will do that.""Again, President Obama persuaded Mr. Trump on Obamacare?  CONWAY:  I wouldn't take it that far.  I believe that President-elect Trump is being properly respectful to President Obama.  This is obviously his signature domestic legislative achievement to hear President Obama say it.  But at the same time, this has been an incredibly important issue to millions and millions of voters who have been disappointed in the ill effects of Obamacare.  I mean, their premiums have increased, their quality has gone down, it was a lie, it was a completely lie uttered dozens of times by the president and others that if you liked your plan you can keep your plan, if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.  You hear people talking about a lack of access.  And now with the Obamacare premium notices coming into your mailboxes and on your computer screens in October, many Americans woke up and said, wait, now I have to make tough choices about every day affordability when it comes to paying the rent or mortgage, food, consumables and my health insurance.  So, this is an issue also politically speaking, Chris, that helped the Republicans win and keep the House and Senate in 2010 and 2014 in those off year elections, and in 2016, they went for a president who had Obamacare repeal and replacement as a centerpiece of his messaging, including if not special in these last weeks in October.  WALLACE:  But I just want to make it clear.  He -- there's the possibility that he would amend the law rather than repeal the law.  I understand he's going to change it, but he might amend it rather than repeal it?  CONWAY:  We don't know because he also has to work with the Congress, which the electorate also decided should be Republican, House and the Senate.  Also decided he should be working with the Republican majority leader in the Senate, a Republican speaker of the House.This election was not close, it was not a squeaker.  There is a mandate there and it is a mandate for his 100-day agenda as well.  And I've got to tell you, Chris, people are -- the voters have also said, stop hiding behind divided government.  For both sides and both legislative -- the legislative and the executive branch, stop using the excuse that you don't have one party rule where you can actually get things done.That excuse has been removed and I think you're going to see him take some significant action on Obamacare and on these other issues that he has talked about like tax reform and defeating radical Islamic terrorism, certainly energy and infrastructure investments, educational opportunities.  He's put all this forth in his 100-day plan.  As people read that, they're going to know exactly what you'll get.  But this is also a legislative process, he needs to work with the people on Capitol Hill, as well as Vice President-elect Pence, to make sure that the results that are effectuated are ones that can actually pass and become law.  WALLACE:  Let's turn to the transition team that Mr. Trump has put together.  Here is what he said on the campaign trail.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and to take our country back from the special interests.  We are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  But, Kellyanne, the leaders of the transition team that Mr. Trump has put together are all familiar politicians and the staff includes lobbyists who are weighing in on who is going to run the agencies that oversee the industries that those lobbyists represent.  Those are the folks that are going to drain the swamp?  CONWAY:  Yes, they are.  If they want to be part of the Trump administration, they are, Chris.  Look, these are people who are talented and have done this before. You can't just appoint novices, you have to have people who know what they're doing.  But at the same time moving forward, this is an administration that's going to run very differently than typical Washington.  Finally, the voters got what they wanted, what they've been begging for for 30 years, which is give us the opportunity, give us a person who actually represents the outsider, non-Washington business experienced type of profile, somebody who goes to Washington owing nobody anything.  And I will tell you at the Trump campaign, none of us got rich off the Trump campaign, and I'm telling you that will continue into the way he runs his government.  The gravy train is about to have its wheels blown off and its engine completely ripped from its bearings because there is just no reason to keep this consultant lobbyist axis, at such a-x-i-s, at such a level where people feel like their interests are not being served.  Part of the rigged, corrupt system that he was giving voice to so often is the one we heard from voters.  They don't appreciate all the organs and adjuncts of Washington, D.C. working against them.  This is an administration for the forgotten man and the forgotten woman.  Nobody thinks of lobbyists and consultants as the forgotten man and the forgotten woman.WALLACE:  Let me talk to you about one specific choice because you said yesterday and you really spurred a lot of consternation and speculation that the choice of White House chief of staff is in your words, quote, ""imminent"", and a lot of people here in Washington believe that that choice, whoever the president decides on, is going to be telling.  The two leading candidates are reportedly Republican Party chair and insider Reince Priebus, and campaign CEO Steve Bannon, who is a fierce anti-establishment critic of Washington.  Won't that, Kellyanne, tell us a lot about how Mr. Trump plans to govern, whether he chooses an insider, maybe he still wants to change it, but by using an insider, or whether he chooses somebody from the outside who really does view Washington as a swamp?  CONWAY:  Well, it tells you a great deal about President Trump that both of those men are thought to have very important roles in his administration, very senior roles, and that regardless of title, that is absolutely what's going to happen and that is probably the case for most of his very small but loyal and frankly effective senior team inner circle.  But I -- you know, the thing about Steve Bannon that people don't understand is that in this campaign, he's been the general, and he's worked very closely with Reince Priebus and the rest of us as part of that small core team.  We couldn't have done it without Priebus or Bannon -- I can say that unequivocally as the campaign manager.  But Bannon has a background as a naval officer, a Goldman Sachs managing partner.  He's been successful in Hollywood as well and people don't know that about him because it's just so easy if you don't know someone to always think of the negative.  In fact, if you're part of the Trump campaign, that's what we've lived through for the last however many months.  But the two of them I know will have very important roles in this administration and this inner circle and Mr. Trump -- President-elect Trump, love the sound of that, President-elect Trump will rely on them and a cadre of other supporters.  WALLACE:  All right.  When you say ""imminent"", are we going to learn it tomorrow?  CONWAY:  Well, imminent means happening soon, as you know, I'm very careful with word choice.  WALLACE:  It means really soon.  CONWAY:  It means really soon and, of course, that timeline and that choice belongs to one man, President-elect Donald J. Trump.WALLACE:  OK, but --  CONWAY:  But, look, he's also -- he's filling many different positions, Chris.  I mean, over there at Trump Tower, we feel as busy as we did when we were winning this campaign as we were, you know, gaming out to win this campaign, bust the blue wall, turn those 197 counties from Obama counties to Trump counties, and grow the party on his terms and his way which he did.  But I have to tell you, we're busier now because transitioning and filling these spots is incredibly important.  Folks there are working 24/7 and that includes Mr. Trump.  WALLACE:  OK, let me turn to one last subject area in the time we have left.  Mr. Trump also told the Wall Street Journal that one of his top priorities as president is to bring the country together.  Here's what he said in his victory speech.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  But since the election, there have been dozens of protests, some of them violent, as you well know across the country.  How does Mr. Trump intend to reach out to the protesters and to the millions of other people who are scared of his presidency?  CONWAY:  Well, he's off to a great start in that victory speech by saying I represent all Americans, even those who did not support me.  And I would say the protesters and those who they supported have a responsibility, Chris, to come together for a peaceful transition and in the name of the world's greatest democracy and recognize that regardless of what they say, quote, ""he is their president.""And you know if the shoe was on the other foot, people's heads would be exploding all across the country, that somehow the Trump -- the Trump voters would not accept Hillary Clinton as their president.  I think that the president of the United States, Secretary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, perhaps, others can come forward and ask for calm and ask for a peaceful transition and ask their supporters, which are masquerading as protesters now -- many of them professional and paid by the way, I'm sure -- ask them to give this man a chance so that this country can flourish.  But, by the way, Donald Trump has also been hearing from Republicans that have not supported him.  He's received calls in the last few days from Carly Fiorina, from Governor Jeb Bush, from Governor John Kasich.  And he is happy to receive those calls as well, as well from heads of states, because, you know, he won Michigan and Ohio without the help of the Republican governors in those states.  But I can tell you, knowing him very well and knowing his management and his leadership style, he is willing to work with everyone who is willing to work with him.WALLACE:  But let --  CONWAY:  Even those who are going to be dragged along.  WALLACE:  Let me ask you about working with everyone, because, finally, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid issued a statement on Friday and I want to read some of it to you and to our viewers.  Reid wrote, ""If this is going to be a time of healing, we must first put the responsibility for healing where it belongs, at the feet of Donald Trump, a sexual predator who lost the popular vote and fueled his campaign with bigotry and hate.""Kellyanne, how do you respond to Senator Reid?  CONWAY:  With complete disappointment.  I'm really pleased as are many Americans that he won't be the Senate minority leader much longer.  He has resigned his seat and we'll have a new Senate minority leader.By the way, the Senate majority leader will be Republican Mitch McConnell.  So, that's good for the republic because we can actually get things done.  I find Harry Reid's public comments and insults about Donald Trump and other Republicans to be beyond the pale.  They're incredibly disappointing.  Talk about not wanting my children to listen to somebody.  And he should be very careful about characterizing somebody in a legal sense.  He thinks -- he thinks he's just being some kind of political pundit there, but I would say be very careful about the way you characterize it.  How is --WALLACE:  But wait, wait, wait.  Are you --CONWAY:  How is that for accepting -- accepting the election results?  You know, Chris --WALLACE:  Are you suggesting, when you say in a legal sense, are you suggesting that Donald Trump might sue Harry Reid?  CONWAY:  No, I'm not suggesting that at all.  I'm suggesting -- I'm calling for responsibility and maturity and decency for somebody who has held one of the highest positions in our government, in a country of more than 300 million people.  I hope President Obama calls Harry Reid today and says, cut it out.  I just met with President-elect Trump, Governor Pence has met with Vice President Biden, the first ladies have met.  I mean, everybody is looking for a peaceful transition here in the name of democracy and you've got the Senate minority leader acting like some garden variety political pundit.  That's what's got to stop.  And you know what?  What was the big narrative going into the election, Chris, where most people in the mainstream media were convinced and, in fact, were cheering for if not aiding and abetting a Hillary Clinton win?  What do they all say?  We hope Donald Trump and his supporters will accept the election results.  And we have Harry Reid coming out and egging people on.  I would put at his feet the fact that a lot of these protesters, I walked right into the firestorm yesterday getting into Trump Tower.  A lot of these protesters are not there peacefully, are not there because they just want to express themselves and make a point or make the difference.  They are there for nefarious conditions, they're booing us, spitting on us.  They're causing all kinds of havoc.  You know, he has to stop.  He has a responsibility.  Harry Reid has a platform to do good here and he ought -- he ought to rise to the occasion and do that.  WALLACE:  Kellyanne, as Ronald Reagan used to say, I think I touched your thermostat there.  Thank you.  Thanks --CONWAY:  I don't like it.  I want the children of America to see decency and honor from our leaders and our elected officials and they are seeing that in President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Pence and, frankly, they are seeing that in President Obama this week as well and Vice President Biden.  So, let's take our cues from them.  WALLACE:  Thank you.  Thanks for your time.  CONWAY:  Thank you.  WALLACE:  And again, congratulations on a remarkable victory.  CONWAY:  I appreciate it, Chris.  Thank you.  WALLACE:  Up next, Republicans in Congress plan their way forward as they prepare to work with President-elect Trump.  We'll talk with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  A look outside the beltway at Union Square, near the state capital in Raleigh, North Carolina.  When Donald Trump takes the oath of office in January, he'll have a Republican majority in both houses of Congress.  Joining us now to discuss the agenda they will pursue on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue is House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy.  Congressman, President-elect Trump talked this week about possibly amending Obamacare instead of repeal and replace.  Is amending good enough?  REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, R-CALI., HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  What he really talked about was keeping preexisting conditions and staying on your parents' healthcare plan to 26.  Those are actually Republicans ideas and those are in the healthcare replacement plan that Republicans have in a better way.  So, we will repeal and replace Obamacare.  Obamacare is failing, premiums up 25 percent, 16 of the 23 coops have failed or are on the verge of it, plans are pulling out, less choice for the public.  It has to change.  WALLACE:  But you can't really legally repeal Obamacare unless you have a super majority in the Senate to beat back a filibuster.  So, one, won't some parts of Obamacare, the law parts, remain in place as opposed to the budget parts and what do you do for those 20 million people who now have health insurance under Obamacare while you're dismantling the plan?  MCCARTHY:  Look, we put a lot of thought into this and we've worked hard to repeal it in the past.  We know there's also a reconciliation, as you know, Chris, that's maybe a little inside Washington, allows with 51 votes to be able to do something in the Senate.  In the House, we can move forward.  But you want to have a transition.  You want to make sure people are protected as they move, that they're able to continue to have coverage and we will be able to do that.  But you've got to stop this one-size-fits-all.  You've got to empower the states.  You've got to have more options.  You've got to repeal that tax on medical device, on individual business employer mandate.  You know, there's 10,000 diseases and we only have 500 cures.  America should be a leader in healthcare and not have this continual rise in the premium price to Americans across this country.  WALLACE:  Congressman, there were big differences between Mr. Trump and congressional Republican leaders during the campaign, but House Speaker Paul Ryan talked about the new Republican government in Washington this week and he sounded pretty exciting.  Here he is.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  With a unified Republican government we can actually get things done for the people of this country.  We now have that and now, we're working on putting the transition plans together to make sure that we can deliver that.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Congressman, what do you think you can get done, especially in the next six months, and what comes first?  MCCARTHY:  Well, you know, it's not even a week since Tuesday's victory, but I see Republicans all working close together.  I have talked to President-elect Donald Trump a couple times.  I just spoke to Vice President Mike Pence just yesterday on the transition, how do we move forward.  We're going to deal with healthcare.  We're going to deal with economic, job growth, that means tax reform that means regulation.  This administration has proposed more than 500 major rulings.  A major ruling costs more than $100 million out there.  So, we've got to roll a lot of those back, get this economy moving again.  Infrastructure.  There are so many places that we can come together, even bipartisan, to get this country working again.  You know, one thing that President-elect Donald Trump did, he listened to the forgotten voices and he became their voice. Washington will change.  And, Chris, I tell you this, on day one, we're not waiting until the inaugural.  That first week of January, when this House is sworn in, we will get to work that day because there is a lot to do and we cannot waste time.  WALLACE:  All right.  Let's go through a lightning round, quick questions, quick answers --  MCCARTHY:  Sure.WALLACE:  -- on some of the ideas that Donald Trump laid out during the campaign, and you tell me how practical they are and how quickly you can do them.  One, build a wall on our southern border.  MCCARTHY:  Well, I think number one, yes, you do have to secure the southern border.  You have to put a wall, it could be all virtual with the UAV airplanes as well, but I think that is doable and one of the first things that needs to be done.  WALLACE:  Now, that's interesting because Paul Ryan kind of fudged on that, too, this week.  You're not committed to a brick and mortar wall along the border for the entire length.  MCCARTHY:  Well, no, I believe you have to have a security all the way through, but when you look at the border, and this is something that the House knows a great deal about because we've actually worked on this and passed it through committee.  When you look at a wall but you also have the technology today with UAVs, you can look out 40 miles ahead.  The terrain is different so you can't always build in just a specific place, but you can protect it.  The number one thing we need to do is protect our border.WALLACE:  OK.  I want to remind you we are on lightning round rules here.  So, we've got to have --MCCARTHY:  Sorry.  WALLACE:  -- quick questions, quick answers.  MCCARTHY:  OK.  WALLACE:  Deportation, mass deportation -- Speaker Ryan has had problems with that.  MCCARTHY:  Well, I think it's difficult to do.  First thing you have to do is secure the border and then we'll have the discussions as we move forward.  WALLACE:  Ten-year infrastructure plan.  Isn't that -- and Trump is talking about ten years, half a trillion dollars.  Isn't that the kind of stimulus package that you opposed under President Obama?  MCCARTHY:  Obama never had infrastructure in his stimulus.  He --WALLACE:  But there were shovel-ready projects, he called it something different.  MCCARTHY:  They were never ready.  We passed a long-term bipartisan highway bill which hadn't been done in more than a decade.  It's smart to plan a long-term one.  America needs to focus on its infrastructure.  It makes us more effective and more efficient.  I think there is a place we could find common ground with Republicans and Democrats.  WALLACE:  Are you ready to renegotiate trade deals even if that risks getting into trade wars?  MCCARTHY:  Look, good trade deals are good for America.  We want manufacturing jobs.  I know the Canadian ambassador said he's willing to talk about it.  But one thing we need when you have 95 percent of people living outside of this country and we produce more than we could actually sell within side, we need good trade deals and that's what President-elect Donald Trump is for, a good deal.  WALLACE:  What about Trump's plan, as he puts it, to drain the swamp in Washington?  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has already said that term limits -- which is one of Trump's ideas -- are going nowhere.  MCCARTHY:  Well, I think what Washington needs to do is wake up to what happened in this election.  This was a big election.  Washington has to change, that we need to make the public understand that this is their government, that we work for them, that we serve them.  That's why you will find on day one --WALLACE:  Yes, but is there going to be structural changes, Congressman, like term limits?  MCCARTHY:  Well, term limits is something that could be brought up and voted on.  I know the Supreme Court kicked it out, said it was unconstitutional, but if it could be voted on and passed, it's a way.  I've watched states do it, some it failed at, and some it worked at.  I think the most important term limit you have is at the ballot box, and we've got to show that we can actually work and solve the problems.  WALLACE:  Some of your committee chairs are still talking about investigating Hillary Clinton.  Here is Congressman Jason Chaffetz who is the chair of the House Committee on Oversight.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JASON CHAFFETZ, R-UTAH:  There's still a lot of questions, and no matter who wins or loses this election come Tuesday, Congress still going to look into it.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Now that Hillary Clinton has been defeated, is that really what you want to spend time on when you have a governing majority, investigating Hillary Clinton?  MCCARTHY:  Look, I'm the majority leader, I set the agenda.  The agenda is going to be about job creation, it's going to be about reforming and repealing Obamacare.  It's going to be on infrastructure.  That's the focus that this election was about.  President-elect Donald Trump has a vigorous agenda.  WALLACE:  Wait.  I got that --  (CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  Congressman, what about investigating Hillary Clinton, is that part of your agenda as the majority leader?  MCCARTHY:  I leave that portion to law enforcement.  That's just the way I do it.  Keep politics out of it.  Let's create jobs in this country.  That's our agenda.  WALLACE:  Finally, what's your sense of Donald Trump?  Do you expect him to lay out broad principles and leave the details of legislation to Congress?  MCCARTHY:  Well, I've dealt with Donald Trump quite a bit.  I've talked to him a lot.  The one thing I found in his business world, he was successful.  He finds the very best people, gives them some freedom, lays out the guidelines and he has high expectations and holds people accountable.  Just look at the ice skating rink in Central Park. He was able to do something that government was not able to do, make it under budget and make the job done on time, just like he did with his recent hotel in Washington, D.C. I think he'll expect that of government and it will be a change and it will be an exciting change.WALLACE: But, briefly, do you expect him to just let -- to lay out principles and then leave the legislating to members of Congress?MCCARTHY: I think what he'll do, he'll lay out the principles, he'll hold us accountable. This is the key part of -- which I think is one of his secret weapons, Vice President-Elect Mike Pence has a clear understanding of how government works being a governor, but also, more importantly, having served in Congress. He'll be able to work together to make sure we're held accountable to get the job done.WALLACE:  Congressman McCarthy, thank you. Thanks for talking with us today. We'll be following all of this. It should be an exciting at least 100 days and I would think six months, maybe even four years. Thank you, sir.MCCARTHY: Thank you.WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss Trump's priorities once he takes office.Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about which Trump we'll see, the unpredictable candidate or the disciplined president?

That's coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  President-Elect Trump laying out some of his priorities in his victory speech early Wednesday morning.And it's time now for our Sunday group. Syndicated columnist George Will, Charles Lane from The Washington Post, Julie Pace who covers the White House and the transition for the Associated Press, and Ben Domenech, co-founder of the web magazine The Federalist.Well, since the election, Mr. Trump has been espousing a pretty standard conservative agenda, he's been reaching out to establishment Republicans, even including Mitt Romney, who spent the entire campaign bashing him.George, as a Trump doubter, are you at all reassured?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Yes, not least of all what was said 20 minutes ago by Kellyanne Conway. She said you can't appoint novices. Well, we just elected one, which is fine, and he seems to realize inevitably that he sits atop an enormous Republican Party infrastructure. He has 4,000 policy making jobs to fill and they are going to come from the pool of the Republican Party, which is thoroughly conservative, and from the intellectual infrastructure of the Republican Party, AEI, other think tanks, The Heritage Foundation, et cetera. And these are people who know what the swamp looks like that he wants to drain. For example, the Office of Civil Rights and the Department of Education, which has been harassing colleges and universities without any legal warrant.Furthermore, he does seem to be committed to the list of judges for the Supreme Court and for the rest of the federal judiciary. Since 1971, when Nixon finally tipped the balance of the Supreme Court, 1971, there's been a conservative majority on the court. There will be a conservative majority for at least 25 more years. Final bit of evidence, Jeb Hensarling being talked about as Treasury secretary. An establishment Republican.WALLACE:  Head of the Financial Services Committee now.WILL: Congressman from Dallas. A wonderful man, talented. He's already fought through that Fannie and Freddie got to go. Things like this. Genuine radicalism.The one thing that I -- that I think indicates the limits of this, and you just brought it up, is term limits. You really want to put the fox among the chickens in this town, advocate term limits. I think he'll pull back from that.WALLACE:  Because that means the lobbyists take over, the permanent Washington takes over from the elected members of Congress.Ben, let's talk about the flipside, and I'm sure some people are -- that are Trump supporters are getting heartburn that George Will is feeling so happy about this. After all his talk about shaking up Washington and draining the swamp, are you worried that he may not be as much of a disrupter as he portrayed himself?BEN DOMENECH, THE FEDERALIST: No, I do think he will be a disrupter, but I think it's going to be in a lot of ways that are unpredictable, fitting with the approach that he's has since he got into this. There is really a question about how many of these internal congressional established members who have been around for quite some time are going to be part of his cabinet, part of his approach. But the fact simply is that Donald Trump has promised the American people a dramatic number of things. A number of different major changes in policy and in the way that Washington works. In order to achieve that, he's going to need more than just, as George mentioned, novices along the lines of people who haven't had experience in the past dealing with policy. It's just a question of whether any of that is going to lead to a softening when it comes to the types of promises that he's delivered to the people.I don't really think that Trump, though, as someone attitudinally, you know, inclined to engage in this -- in this type of promise to the American people, is anyone who wants to back off of those things. I think he wants to deliver. And I think that that's why you're going to see a lot of people who come in, who even if they may have some significant degree of experience, they may have a long tenure in this town, they also are going to be people who are going to fit in -- in terms of their approach to a dramatic level of reform, a dramatic level of change.WALLACE:  One of the most striking images this week I think we'll all agree was Donald Trump and Barack Obama meeting together, talking together in the Oval Office. They said all the right things about a smooth transition. But let's remember what Mr. Obama said about Mr. Trump on the campaign trail.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community let's down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Julie, what do your sources tell you about what really went on in that meeting? Does Mr. Obama really think that he made any inroads in persuading Donald Trump and -- or does he basically think Trump meant what he said when he said he was going to blow up the Obama legacy?JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: I think they don't know exactly what the outcome of that meeting will be. I do think that Obama, he said this publicly, that he feels encouraged by the fact that Trump has said he wants to at least work with the president's team for this transition period.This is such a massive process that is going to get underway right now and I think that the Trump team would be smart to lean on people who have experience doing it, both in previous Republican administrations, but also in the current administration. I think that both men are saying all of the right things, but --WALLACE:  But in terms of policy, did -- di Mr. Obama think he made any headway and this is going to give a lot of Trump supporters heartburn?PACE: Again, I don't think he -- I don't think he knows yet. I think that if you look at some of the things that Trump has said about Obamacare in the last few days, including in ""The Wall Street Journal"" interview, he did say he would -- he would take under advisement some of the things that Trump -- or that Obama said during that meeting. But we have now four years where we'll be able to have a much clearer picture than what has happened over the last couple of days.WALLACE:  I've got to say, though, I think that the mainstream media has gotten this one wrong in the sense that when Trump talks about keeping preexisting conditions or keeping the idea that parents can keep their kids on their insurance until age 26, that's been part of Republican policy for years in terms of reforming Obamacare. That is not a change.PACE: It's not -- it's not a change and he's talked about some of those things during the course of the campaign as well. I think it was striking, though, to hear him say that he heard what the president said and would -- would take that under advisement.WALLACE:  We asked you for questions for the panel and we got a bunch about this question of which Trump we will see as president. James Cammarata sent this on Facebook, ""how will Donald Trump balance his brash and direct style, which many find refreshing, with the discipline required of a president?""Chuck, any idea how to answer James about which Trump we're going to see?CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: Put it this way, the only person at this point who can defeat Donald Trump is Donald Trump. He is the one who has it within his power, really just through his behavior and temperament, to make and break this crucial six-month period here. And we've had conflicting signals. We've seen him give a very statesmanlike speech after he was --WALLACE:  The victory speech.LANE: After he was elected and we've seen him conduct himself with great dignity in the White House. And then we have, thank you, Julie, last night his tweet, ""wow, 'The New York Times' is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor, highly inaccurate coverage of the Trump phenomenon."" We also had a somewhat provocative tweet he put out with respect to protesters. He has said, oh, I will be restrained with Twitter. This is the imponderable --WALLACE:  Are you sure that isn't a bad thing for him to take a shot at The New York Times?LANE: Politically, I'm sure it makes his folks feel great. I'm sure it makes him feel great. Here's what I'm driving at. The world is full of surprises and very often they come in the foreign policy arena from the -- for the first six months of a new president. His ability to control this side of himself in such a crisis, if it comes, will have a lot to do with just about everything else he's trying to achieve.WALLACE:  All right, we have to take a break here, but when we come back, we're going to take a look at why Donald Trump won and why Hillary Clinton lost. We break down what really happened. That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I know how disappointed you feel, because I feel it, too.TRUMP: Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Hillary Clinton's concession speech Wednesday morning after Donald Trump's victory speech a few hours before.And we're back now with the panel.Well, there are a number of ways to look back at this stunning election and why Donald Trump won. Let's put a couple of them up on the screen. One is that the Trump base of working class whites turned out big time. He carried them by 39 points this week as compared to Mitt Romney's 25 point margin four years ago. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton underperformed badly. Mr. Trump got fewer votes in winning that Romney got in losing, but Hillary Clinton got 5 million fewer votes than President Obama did in 2012.Chuck, how do you explain Trump's victory?LANE: Well, I think the first thing I have to say is to admit that I didn't expect it and that I've been trying to understand why I got this wrong and why so many others got it wrong, and that leads me to my answer to your question, which is, like so many others, I didn't understand the surge in sentiment that was going on out there in states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, et cetera. And what I think that is related to is that for many people this was a -- this was a vote -- and it's been called a protest. I think that's too easy. It's more like a statement. It's more like an expression. It's more like a demand for validation from people who, as Mr. Trump has said, and I think we're in -- we must defer to his judgment at this point, who felt forgotten and who felt that Washington was focused on the grievances of lots and lots of other people.You know, two groups formed the core of the respective parties, African-Americans formed the core of the Democratic Party, the core of the core, evangelical whites, the core of the core of Republicans. Each was presented with a very apocalyptic view of this election and told, turn out, turn out or else you're doomed. And it turns out it was the white evangelicals who responded a little bit more than the African-Americans, who, I think, showed less enthusiasm this time than they did for Obama. And I think that may have decided it.WALLACE:  Hillary Clinton had a different explanation for her defeat. She told big donors on a conference call this weekend that FBI Director Comey's two letters in the final days about her e-mails beat her, depressing her turnout and boosting Trump's.Julie, how do Democrats you talk to, what do they think was responsible for Clinton's defeat and do they think it was all about Come?PACE: No, they don't. Democrats certainly don't think that Comey's initial letter was helpful. If Clinton did have any momentum going into the final week, the Comey letter probably slowed it. I think it's important, though, to point out that Clinton's own advisors, after the first Comey letter was sent, said that their polling had already tightened prior to that letter. So they were seeing something happening in this race before the Comey letter got sent out.The second point I would make is that, if you look at Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, threes states that Democrats have reliably relied on in presidential elections, and you look at her numbers there, it's really hard to say that a letter from the FBI director, a week before the election, was the driving force there. If you look at those numbers with white working class voters, many who voted for Barack Obama, she did not have a message for them. She never, in some cases, went to their state to even talk to them. So I think that this is becoming a crutch for the Clinton campaign, but for Democrats broadly they see this as part of a much bigger problem, much more than what the FBI director did.DOMENECH: To Julie's point about -- about this existence of a phenomenon that seems unfamiliar to people who didn't actually go and talk to these voters, the Obama/Trump voter is a real thing. Of the almost 700 counties across the county that voted for Barack Obama twice, Donald Trump won 209 of them. Of the counties that never voted for Obama, she won six. This is a situation where you had a number of voters who made a decision, a rational decision, that after eight years of Obama they were dissatisfied with what they saw coming out of Washington and they went to Donald Trump.And it's true, she didn't go to Wisconsin. She didn't go and speak to these voters. They spent more money chasing one electoral vote coming out of Nebraska than they did in terms of -- in terms of Wisconsin and Michigan over the course of the ending days of this campaign. And it's ludicrous to suggest that non-college educated whites in the -- in the Midwest, in the rust belt, were going to be so dramatically motivated by what is essentially an inside the beltway process story coming from --WALLACE:  The Comey letter.DOMENECH: From -- from the Comey letter, that really all it did was vindicate what people already knew about Hillary Clinton.WALLACE:  You know, George, one of the things that -- and we've been around too long probably, we shouldn't tell people that, but one of the things I'm always amused by is at the end of a campaign, the winning campaign, they were all geniuses. The losing campaign, they were all dopes. The winning party, they're on the course to building a permanent majority in the country. The losing campaign is in tatters. How much of that is actually true?WILL: Well, the losing party here is in tatters. The Republican Party is as strong as it's been since the 1920s and probably more. Broad and deep. Sixty-nine of 99 state legislative chambers are now controlled by the Republicans. Twenty-four states, they have the Republican governor and the entire control of the legislature. Only six states have Democratic governors and Democratic legislatures. Thirty-four Republican governors. That means if you're looking for a deeper bench for presidential candidates for the Democratic Party, you have to start with 16 governors is all they've got. Furthermore, one-third of the House caucus of the Democratic Party are from three states, Massachusetts, New York and California.WALLACE:  Yes, I saw that. That's astonishing.WILL: That's -- they're -- they're in danger of becoming what the Republicans were thought to be in danger of becoming, a regional party.WALLACE:  But -- but let me pursue this with you because there was so much talk before the election, before election night, just before election night, about the Republican Party being in shambles and that there was this split between the establishment and the Cruz conservative Tea Party wing and the Trumpists. What happened to that?WILL: They were united by Barack Obama. They were united by an agenda. Chuck said people felt forgotten by -- no, I think they felt condescended to. And there's something about progressivism that just is condescension. We know what your healthcare ought to be, be quiet and take your medicine. We know how much water should come through your shower head. We know what kind of toilets you ought to have. We're going to change your light bulbs, be quiet and take our direction, and people are tired of it.LANE: Yes. Well, I -- I have to say, I'll take that as a friendly amendment, George. And I also think, just when we're talking about factors here, I think environmentalism in a usual way worked against the Democratic Party this year. I did a little back of the envelope coalition about the most coal dependent states in terms of electricity generation in this country. There are 25 most dependent, 20 of them Trump carried. He carried Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin, which are the three most coal dependent states in terms of electricity generation. That power plan to focus on global warming and stuff that he pushed with a relatively thin legal basis might have provided the small -- a part, at least, of the small margin that contributed to his defeat.DOMENECH: There is a great -- there's a great irony in Bill Clinton ending his career arguing a lonely voice within the Clinton campaign that they need to pay attention to the needs and priorities of the white, working class. He was the only one within that campaign structure who actually had that right, and they didn't listen to him.PACE: And he was laughed at --DOMENECH: Yes.PACE: And ridiculed by a lot of people in the Clinton campaign who said he is --WALLACE:  Is that really true?PACE: Yes.WALLACE:  I mean I've heard that but --PACE: After the -- after the Wisconsin primary when Bill Clinton wanted Hillary to spend more time there, they laughed at him.DOMENECH: Yes.WALLACE:  No, go ahead. You can finish your --PACE: No, they -- they -- they laughed at him and -- and basically said --DOMENECH: They decided --PACE: He's going after the voters that supported him instead of the ones that will -- he says she'll need.WALLACE:  Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday. Up next, a look back at one of the most remarkable weeks ever in presidential politics(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  A look at the skyline of Columbus, Ohio. A bell weather state that Mr. Trump turned into a blowout win for Republicans.Well, for the past 18 months, we've been following the twists and turns on the campaign trail, but now we're looking ahead to the transition for President-Elect Donald Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the United States.TRUMP: It's been what they call a historic event, but to be really historic, we have to do a great job.CLINTON: This is painful and it will be for a long time.RYAN: He connected in ways with people no one else did. He turned politics on its head. And now Donald Trump will lead a unified Republican government.OBAMA: Everybody is sad when their side loses an election. But the day after, we have to remember that we're actually all on one team.CROWD (changing): Not my president! Not my president!(INAUDIBLE).OBAMA: We now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed, because if you succeed, then the country succeeds.TRUMP: Mr. President, it was a great honor being with you and I look forward to being with you many, many more times in the future. Thank you.(INAUDIBLE)RYAN: This is the amphitheater (INAUDIBLE).QUESTION: What's your reaction?TRUMP: Really beautiful.JIMMY FALLON, ""THE TONIGHT SHOW"": Of course this means that early next year Trump will be moving into the White House where he will become the first president who moves in and hangs up his own portrait.(INAUDIBLE)STEPHEN COLBERT, ""THE LATE SHOW"": This -- this is what it feels like when America is made great again. I --QUESTION: What was -- what was on the agenda today for you?JIMMY KIMMEL, ""JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE"": Weirdest dream last night. Remember that guy who used to host ""The Apprentice""? I dreamed we elected him president.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  And now with 68 days until his inauguration, there's a lot of work ahead for Donald Trump and his team.And that's it for today.
