"This is a rush transcript from ""Hannity,"" July 26, 2013. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Now to be fair, Anthony Weiner is not the only politician, Republican or Democrat, to find themselves embroiled in scandal. However, the important questions we're asking tonight, has this behavior become the norm here in America, the new norm. Is power more important than dignity? And how can we help save America?Here to answer all those questions, our wonderful studio audience. Good to see you all. All right. Show of hands. Does private life like Anthony Weiner, should it matter in an election? Yes? Hold your hands up. No? Hands up. Tamara Holder.TAMARA HOLDER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: OK. Well, first of all, most men cheat. I would say about --(BOOS)No, I would say, so, the first thing is most men cheat. We're one of the few species who tries to not have cheating as part of our lives.HANNITY: Guys, do you agree with this?HOLDER: No, this is factually true.The next thing is, is that we have to look at what politicians have to say on the issues. Not with their sexting -- Kennedy did it 100 years ago.BO DIETL, FORMER NYPD DETECTIVE: Tamara, Tamara, first of all --HOLDER: Bill Clinton did it 100 years ago. It doesn't matter.DIETL: I take exception as a man that all men cheat. How about women cheating? But that's not the point here.HOLDER: Have you ever cheated?DIETL: Well, this has not -- this has not stopped.HOLDER: Have you ever cheated?(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)HANNITY: Well, I'll answer that question. I haven't. I've been married 20 years.HOLDER: You're one of the few. You're one of the few. Most do.HANNITY: One of the few. Anywhere else here hasn't cheated? There you go. Thank you very much.DAVID WEBB, SIRIUS XM PATRIOT HOST: Where do you get the evidence that most men cheat?HANNITY: Did I see your hand go up?BILL CUNNINGHAM, TV AND RADIO HOST: Almost for this reason. It depends what the private misbehavior is. Clinton had the cigar and the blue dress. Now, he lied under oath to a federal judge -- I did not have sex with that woman --HANNITY: I did not have sex with that woman, not a single time.CUNNINGHAM: Bingo. Now, did he lie to a federal judge committing at least civil contempt of court? Yes Now, in Weiner's case, in Anthony's Weiner case, what this amounts to is private behavior, not involving a public office, the guy is a pervert, there's no question he has got sexual problems. But I don't care about --HANNITY: Do you want a pervert being in office?CUNNINGHAM: We already have perverts, look at Penn State.WEBB: Sean, there's a --(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)HANNITY: Weiner was taking a picture of his wiener.CUNNINGHAM: What about Sandusky?HANNITY: And sending them out to a 23-year-old girl.CUNNINGHAM: What did Sandusky do?HANNITY: All right. Bernie McGuirk, yes.BERNARD MCGUIRK, ""IMUS IN THE MORNING"" PRODUCER: That's a matter of technology. He's still no different than say Bill Clinton.Look, I don't like the term but it applies to him, creepy ass cracker, is Anthony Weiner. As a matter of fact, his online pseudonym should be fugly psycho.(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)He did not do anything worse than Bill Clinton did. Technology allows him to do it now. And as far as all men cheat, if all you date is married men, you're going to have that perception.HANNITY: All right. Up here.WEBB: All right. Weiner does what he does. All that can be debated over and over. Let's go to compromise in his office and what he does in his judgment. We expect our politicians to have judgment, our elected officials. How good is his judgment when he does this, he lies about it, he asks for your trusts as a voter, and then goes out and does it again? And by the way, there is more coming on Anthony Weiner and what he's done.HANNITY: Absolutely.SCOTTIE HUGHES, TEA PARTY NEWS NETWORK: Here's the difference with Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton did this act in office. In the Oval Office. That's where he should have been held accountable. And we've created this atmosphere of allowing politicians to become celebrities and it's the misinformed voter that's allowing him to be re-elected.HANNITY: All right. Brooke, yes.BROOKE GOLDSTEIN, THE LAWFARE PROJECT DIRECTOR: OK. What's amazing to me is that we're spending time debating smeckle gate (ph), OK, When Huma Abedin, who has connections to the Muslim Brotherhood, who was connected to the chief financier of Al Qaeda, is his wife and has top security clearance.HANNITY: She has a great point.GOLDSTEIN: Why are we debating this?(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)MONICA CROWLEY, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Actually, what Brooke points to, that's the real Huma Abedin story. It's not about Weiner's wiener.HANNITY: Wow!CROWLEY: It's about Huma Abedin and her ties to Islamic --DIETL: Also, assistant to our secretary.CROWLEY: And soon to be maybe next president of the United States. That's what this story is really about.HANNITY: Sally.SALLY KOHN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: First of all, a lot of that has been disputed, I don't think we're going to get into that here. But she's also not running for office, we're not talking to her. I do think the larger issue that you raised here, Sean, is look, this kind of thing happens to Democrats and Republicans because we have allowed our political leaders, our celebrities, to fester in this culture where we put individual --HANNITY: So, it's really the people's problems.KOHN: No, what I'm saying, we put individuals above everyone in the common place. They're in government. They should be working for the common good and we've lost that.HANNITY: Wait a minute. Sally is making a point. Is -- really they represent the people. The people have decided what, it's OK? Katie.KATIE PAVLICH, TOWNHALL.COM: Well, in some cases, they have. But in terms of going back to Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton is the president of the United States. Set an example. And Hillary Clinton as the first lady at the time set an example that women should lower their standards and allow and dismiss this behavior so they can have power and that translates later for opportunities for them.Huma standing next to her man is not brave. Anthony Weiner is a sexual predator. And I take issue with the idea that we as human beings shouldn't have a level of monogamy and control. We're not animals. We're not like other species, not all men cheat.HANNITY: Are you listening Tamara?HOLDER: Yes. I'm listening. I just don't understand how you can make accusation that Anthony Weiner is a sexual predator. That is a crime, and just because he is engaging in very creepy behavior which I don't approve of, it doesn't make him a sexual predator.HANNITY: Hang on. Does he remind you of a guy like in the -- this is technology that has changed things, but he's kind of reminds me of the guy with the raincoat flashing people.DIETL: Sean, Sean, Sean --HOLDER: He engaged in an exchange of information. I mean, this is a guy who was unfaithful -- what elected official -- let me finish.DIETL: Sean.HOLDER: What elected official -- let me finish, what elected official --HANNITY: All right. We have got to take a break.DIETL: What happened to character? What happened to character? Character to be the mayor of this great city. This guy is a slime ball.Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2013 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Well, this is all about the statement from the Cairo embassy that came out early yesterday morning about noon time in Cairo where it said that ""The embassy condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims."" It didn't talk about the upcoming protest that was expected. It reiterated that, saying it stood by that statement later in the day when the protests were happening and when they scaled the wall and took down the American flag shortly thereafter.Now, the Romney campaign put out a statement about the attacks, about the loss of life in Libya, and it continued ""It's disgraceful that the Obama administration's first response was not to condemn the attacks on our diplomatic missions but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks.""  So how does this play as you hear the back and forth? We're back with our panel. Steve?STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Well, I think on the substance Mitt Romney's critique is the right critique. The president did send mixed signals. The administration from the first tweet from the embassy in Egypt did lead with an apology. Even subsequent statements by Hillary Clinton where she added in a denunciation of the violence always led with what was tantamount to an apology.So I think on the substance, he's got a very good case. On the timing would I have done in the press conference today, I probably wouldn't have, but that has much more to do with the fact that you knew the media were going to obsess on this, and obsess on it they did. They are so now fascinated by this process story, using this process story the beat up Mitt Romney rather than taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture question about the policies.I mean, you have in effect, what we're witnessing is perhaps a partial collapse of the Obama doctrine, the ""leading from behind"" manifesto that has governed the way the administration has conducted foreign policy over the past three-and-a-half years. And all we heard about all day today was the media and whether Mitt Romney should have put out a statement at that time.BAIER: Mara, the administration did disavow the Cairo embassy's original statement --(CROSSTALK)BAIER: -- 16 hours later.MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: But then they repeated the same sentiment today, both the president and Hillary Clinton in the Rose Garden.BAIER: I understand. But the tick-tock on how it happened.  LIASSON:   They said in a quote to Politico they seemed to disavow it.BAIER: And ABC News.LIASSON: But then later the embassy re-tweeted the same thing saying we are not going to apologize, and even if our embassy has been breached we're still believe in, you know, will speak out against bigotry.BAIER: So that in and of itself is confusing.LIASSON: Yes. And the problem is that if Mitt Romney wants to make an argument against the way the president has handled the Arab spring, he needs to make it. And he wasn't making it today and he was just focusing on the statement. If that is it, if that's the sum total of his charge against the Obama administration I don't know where it's going to go. And he did, it's risky if you inject yourself into a fast-moving foreign crisis, he learned this through the Chinese dissident story where he got involved and then the next thing you know he was criticizing the administration for not getting the guy out and then the guy gets out.I just think that these things have to be thought through and he has to make the arguments and he has to make them in a concerted way over time. If this is just going to be a one-day thing where he takes a swipe at Obama and then goes back to the economy I don't know how it's going to help him.BAIER: Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I agree. I think the substance of what Romney said at that time was absolutely right. The problem is that he needs to make a larger argument. There is a collapse of Obama's policy. It began with the Cairo speech. It began with the apologies to Iran. It began with regret for the Iraq war. It began with the so-called outreach, and it completely collapsed. It has gotten nowhere on Iran. These are the fruits of appeasement and apology.  He should make a general speech, not attack here and there, but a speech explaining and connecting all the dots. That's what a candidate ought to do and to leave attacks to surrogates and to Ryan.BAIER: There is much more to talk about about the politics of all this and we want to go through all the polls as well. That's why we have an online show on Wednesdays, and it follows this program. That's it for panel. But stay tuned for something lighter. Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC.
