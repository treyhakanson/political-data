This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: I told them it was a birthmark.Hello, everyone. I'm Greg Gutfeld, along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Bob Beckel, Eric Bolling, and she river-rafts on a Triscuit, it's Dana Perino.This is ""The Five.""(MUSIC)GUTFELD: With apologies to Gwen Ifill, here's where we are with Benghazi. The decision to blame that video? It was a political one, even the libs admit it now. But they also add that the Republican outrage that followed that's political too.You see, in a liberal world you can never call them on their scandals. When you catch them red handed, you're as bad as they are.So, you have one team, the Dems, on the field, mocking the other side for a showing up. It's as if the Dems are saying only we can play dirty.But political wars happen when the media gives up its job to seek the truth. Imagine if the press had pursued the video lie from the start, then journalism would prevail over politics. We'd be seeing more of Woodward's pen and less of Trey Gowdy's hair. It's nice.When reporters snuggle with the president, the frustrated public seeks out the other side for aid. It's the same with climate change: when one side is so clearly biased, polar ice caps turned polarizing. Obama says he's briefed often on the issue, by whom? His caddy?Every divisive issue today is borne from a pliant media. Politics is now a team sport because the ref is corrupt.So, what's the new spin on Benghazi? Hillary is a victim.This Benghazi stuff is just too much for this delicate flower, who I seem to remember once dodged a firefight in Bosnia. Wait, was that real?I say if you can't stand the heat, then stay out of the kitchen, Hillary -- but that would be sexist.So, first off, we have -- we have a serious issue with Bob Beckel that we need to get out in the open.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Are we going to talk about it?GUTFELD: Yes.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Are we talking about it?GUTFELD: Yes, we are.PERINO: I'm not talking about it.GUTFELD: Bob?BOB BECKEL, CO-HOST: What?You are not expecting me to talk about my apartment, are you?GUTFELD: Yes, I am.GUILFOYLE: Well, it's a New York -- this is what I want to get over here too. Get me that studio.BECKEL: If you want to use this time to go through that, that's fine.GUILFOYLE: It's so bad.(LAUGHTER)BECKEL: First of all, can I say something about this whole issue. Let's leave aside the bed bugs --GUILFOYLE: Bob has bed bugs.BECKEL: Let's get into what happened Friday, because I heard a lot of people who got in touch with me by Twitter and by Facebook, and I want to clarify what I said. I'm not apologizing on minute.What I said was, it was that I didn't care about four dead Americans, of course I do. But what I said was I was the first one on the show to come out and say it was a terrorist attack when it happened. I was the first one, Democrat, as far as I know to admit it was a political attack during the campaign.And now, I'm also the first one to say that what Republicans have done is turned in four dead bodies have been turned into a political act they can play off. And they're the one -- I don't care about the Republicans. I could care less. I think any Democrat who shows up at this committee, ought to take his Democratic registration away from them. It's a sham and it's a shame that Republicans would use these people for political points.PERINO: That's not why people were mad at you.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Yes, here's what you just said. You are ashamed that Republicans would use this for political purposes. And then on Friday you said, the whole thing, the whole thing cover-up, yes it was cover-up and yes it was OK because it was political.BECKEL: No, no, I didn't say it was OK.BOLLING: No, you did. That's why people lost their mind.BECKEL: Now, we're going to start all over again. If you want to get back into it --BOLLING: I didn't start it.BECKEL: Well, you just did --BOLLING: You did.BECKEL: I said on Friday -- let me ask Dana --PERINO: I can clarify and I remember and I sat and I read all the tweets. And it was with you Saturday night.BECKEL: Yes, right.GUTFELD: Hence the bed bugs.GUILFOYLE: Poor Jasper. And it wasn't Jasper.PERINO: It wasn't Jasper.GUILFOYLE: No.PERINO: OK. Bob, what you said that made people mad and maybe you didn't mean it was the specific line that no one out there in America, no viewers, no people out there, care about this issue. And there are a lot of people that care about the issue and that's why they were mad, with the suggestion that they don't care about either what happened to the people or being lied to by their government and that they want to get to the truth. That's what they were mad about.BECKEL: OK.GUTFELD: And the reason why they are mad is they sense there's no media presence other than FOX and some other folk that are actually doing anything. When you have the prevailing mentality now it's no big deal, dude. The public gets angry because they are saying they are going to get away with this. Isn't that right?BOLLING: Well, you know, I happened to sneak into the MSNBC party on Saturday night at the White House Correspondents' Dinner. I spoke to that guy for half guy. And I said, what were you thinking? What is wrong? He literally thinks, Tommy Vietor, he literally thinks he said nothing wrong.I said, do you understand what you did? You look Bret Baier in the eye, you looked at American people in the eye, and said, dude, it's 21 months or two years ago like it didn't matter that there was a big cover-up going on. He said, well, that's the way I kind of talk.And I said, it doesn't matter that you said, dude, it's the fact that you said that was a two years ago. You dismissed it as some would think Bob was dismissing on Friday saying it doesn't matter to the American people. It does matter to a lot of people.BECKEL: But you want to say something -- I don't want --GUILFOYLE: I would like to say this. I think you got a little worked up. I know your heart is in the right place and I think you are trying to make it right here and I commend you for being stand up for that.GUTFELD: I'm not sure that's his heart. It might be a new heart.GUILFOYLE: He has multiple hearts beating right now.BECKEL: You're right about that.Let me -- let me make this one as quickly as I can. I hear what you are saying, Dana, I think if the impression was I thought the American people didn't care about these people being dead or that they got lied to during the campaign, what I said was I accept the fact that it was a terrorist fact, I accept the fact that they politicized it. I accept the fact that it was probably -- you know, the video thing was not a part of this thing, it was used as a cover-up, but I don't know -- there's nothing in that that's an indictable offense to anybody, and we got so many other problems in this country, it's time to move on.GUTFELD: But the thing is, you would want to it to move on when it's your side under scrutiny. If a Republican was in office, you would say hang them up.BECKEL: Well, that may be true.PERINO: That's true.Here's why I do think it matters, as we get more and more information and the American interests, I guess it was, I think they wrote a piece today that I thought was very good it gets it right now right down to the timeline at 10:30 p.m. on the night of the attack and the phone call between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and what was discussed there because two minutes later is when Hillary Clinton releases a statement talking about the video.That is a question of judgment and character of our government and that is why it matters, and it slowly but surely they get closer to the truth. I don't know if it's an indictable offense, but the question of who pushed the video is not just about the video itself. It goes to the larger problem.GUTFELD: Yes. I want to throw to a sound on tape from ""Fox and Friends."" What?GUILFOYLE: Yes, charming.GUTFELD: Yes, Sharyl Attkisson on the strategy to marginalize Benghazi through various lexiconic turns of phrase, not even word.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SHARYL ATTKISSON: The keywords they used such as conspiracy and delusional are in my opinion clearly designed to try to controversialize a story, a legitimate news story and a legitimate area of journalistic inquiry, to some danger that's be successful but I think primarily that don't want to look at this as a story in the first place. But I see that as a well orchestrated strategy to controversialize a story they really don't want to hear about.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUFELD: I thought I had evidence of this. Or maybe I don't.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DAVID PLOUFFE, FORMER OBAMA ADVISER: This has been politicized like we've never seen before. There's a very loud delusional minority that's driving our politics, that's in control of the Republic Party. There's no conspiracy here at all.REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA: What do they talk about, Benghazi, Pelosi. It's all diversionary. It's totally unimportant and I couldn't care less personally about them.LT. GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D), CALIFORNIA: Last week, the obsession of ObamaCare seem to wane a little bit and they went back to the old golden oldie, Benghazi, Benghazi.BILL MAHER: Why are they handcuffing themselves to this dead hooker revelation (ph)?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If this weren't about politics, we would be talking about the 200-plus missing girls in Nigeria, we would be talking about the outbreak of world in south Sudan. There's so many important issues around the world which involved people's lives, helpless people's lives that could use a little attention.(END VIDEO CLIPS)GUTFELD: Basically they're saying it's like a finite pi of stories. If you do this story, you cannot do the other story.BOLLING: I truly love my brother sitting right here. I pulled a shrimp out his throat once, I would do it again. However, it's very, very interesting that on Friday, the whole dust up happened because, Bob, you went down that same path that Ifill just did. Turning debate from what really went on to Benghazi and a cover-up, the cover-up to followed to 200 dead women in Africa somewhere and then you and I got into it because I said stay on topic.Why is it when Gwen Ifill and maybe some other Democrats are trying to, I don't know, change the subject, look over here, there's a shiny object over here? Is it concerted? Are you part of the concert?I don't know.BECKEL: I don't -- listen, do I think that this thing is -- first of all, do I believe that this investigation, this special committee is a sham, yes. Do I think it was a conspiracy in some form or another to deal with the presidential campaign, I've already said that, yes.The question I've got, what I don't care about is staying and listening to this over and over and over again.GUILFOYLE: But why not?GUTFELD: But, Bob, what you just said necessitates what you don't like. If you say this is an effort to win an election, Kimberly, it necessitates the outrage that follows.GUIFOYLE: Doesn't it make perfect sense? Why wouldn't you care having acknowledged, bravely, honestly, all the things you have, why wouldn't you want to get the bottom of it?I mean, you just want to say, OK, yes, they did it. That's what people do and you're playing politics in the big league. I still don't think that's the sufficient answer. That's why I'm happy Trey Gowdy is going to be asking the questions.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Oh my God!GUTFELD: The most important here is the new spin, the new spin which is that Hillary Clinton is the victim. She might not run.GUILFOYLE: This is terrible.PERINO: This is terrible.GUILFOYLE: It's true, though.PERINO: It is true.OK. So this morning I wake up, the first thing I read is a piece that says if Hillary decides not to run for president.GUTFELD: Michael Hirsch, right?PERINO: Michael Hirsch writes in ""Politico"" magazine, that if she decides not to run is probably because Republicans have disgusted her in the media and she doesn't want to have to put up with them.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: She doesn't want to talk about it.GUTFELD: Exactly.PERINO: She and the president are the only two who can truly answer the question who pushed the video. And Marc Thiessen writes today in ""Washington Post"" I think, he's exactly right. There's a way we could figure this all out. They could get this done.You could even forego the special committee, if they would release the president's daily intelligence briefing. Let the Republicans and Democrats look at those. If the video is mentioned in that, there's a high, medium or low probability or not mentioned at all, we will have our answer.BECKEL: Do you guys think -- you really think that the Republicans are doing this for the good of the country or are they politicizing it in order to get points against Barack Obama.PERINO: I do.BOLLING: Well, you know, Bob, you're (INAUDIBLE) because politicizing it to cover up for Obama because it's an election year was OK. But politicizing it now is a bad thing.Can I make -- can I make one other point?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Allow me -- no one on the left has admitted that the cover- up is for politics besides you.GUILFOYLE: Besides you.BOLLING: There's one other thing that we haven't really discussed. Not only who pushed the video but who gave a stand down order. Who said don't go help -- remember, two died originally, two more died seven hours later. We need to fill in that timeline.GUILFOYLE: We filled in the gaps. That's a significant time gap.GUTFELD: Why was there a stand down? Because it was called a demonstration and not a terrorist attack. If it was a terrorist attack, there would be no stand down, but if you call it a demonstration, you can't send people out, right?PERINO: It is very strange they continue to tell the story about the video so long and now they are trying to cover it up.And I think they actually could solve this very easily. There is precedent for it. In the 9/11 Commission report, President Bush released his daily intelligence briefings and said, OK, do you want to see I was given, the information I was given? Here it is.GUILFOYLE: They won't do it.PERINO: President Obama could do -- it's just the same thing that President Bush did.BECKEL: But if he did that --GUILFOYLE: Great point and they are not doing it.BECKEL: It did say nothing about the video, what difference does it make?GUTFELD: Well, it actually goes to something that you would be interested in, Bob. Did the order come down from above because they were afraid to blame Muslims, because they were fearful of the Islamophobia- phobia, so they said, let's blame the video instead. That would upset you.BECKEL: Yes, it would upset me enormously. In the middle of a presidential campaign, which I've been in several --BOLLING: Don't forget.BECKEL: I think that was the thinking. The thinking was --PERINO: It was not worse to you that Hillary Clinton told the father of one of the dead Americans that they were going to get the video maker? That's -- so she's basically furthering the lie.BECKEL: If she knew that the video was not a part --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: All we want to know is how did she know that? How do they know? That's all they have to answer. That's the simple question.GUILFOYLE: But they won't answer it because, you know, they know they are guilty. They are going to avoid the whole issue, obfuscate so you like point that they are the bad guys on this. They want it to go away and that's why they're talking with these other talking points and trying to create other issues.BOLLING: There's one more piece to this. Don't forget -- this was prior to Osama bin Laden being taken down, the thought was and the discussion was, is President Obama going into the re-election soft on terror or not. A lot of people were saying -- was it after?PERINO: Yes, a year.BOLLING: I take it back.GUTFELD: Next on ""The Five"" --PERINO: But a great point if it were true.GUTFELD: All right.GUILFOYLE: The bed bugs got him.GUTFELD: Eric has the highlights from the White House Correspondents Dinner this weekend. So, stay tuned for that and more, coming up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Welcome back to the fastest seven. You know the drill, three rousing stories, seven accelerated minutes, one animated host.First up, some sights and sounds from the White House Correspondents' Dinner Saturday night. A usually self-deprecating president did that, but also took some shots at FOX and also delivered some jokes about Republicans.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Let's face it, FOX, you'll miss me when I'm gone. It will be harder to convince the American people that Hillary was born in Kenya.(LAUGHTER)These days, the House Republicans actually give John Boehner a harder time than they give me, which means orange really is the new black.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: That's the show. We'll --GUILFOYLE: That I liked a lot.BOLLING: You did. As soon as he delivered that line --GUILFOYLE: I laughed out loud.BECKEL: What does it mean?GUTFELD: Based on a fashion phrase, like something is the new black in fashion. It's also a name of a new show of women in prison. They wear orange, orange is the new black.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: And Boehner is said to be very tan or orange at times.K.G.?GUILFOYLE: Like our fastest seven host.BOLLING: Stop it. Stop it.GUILFOYLE: Listen, I thought he was funny. He's got very good comedic timing. I give props where they are due.I don't know, I had a great time. It might have been the wine. But it seemed to go over well, you know? I think Joel McHale was a little funny, except he was a little mean about Christie.BOLLING: Chris Christie, he was a little hard on Christie.GUILFOYLE: Yes.BOLLING: President Obama, self-deprecating is kind of fun. He can deliver a joke.BECKEL: Yes, he can deliver a joke.Let me first of all say how desperately badly I feel about not being there and I cried all day because I missed it, but I'm glad you stood up for us. So that was good.PERINO: What did you do instead?BECKEL: I went to a comedy a show, real comedy show, that Dana invited me, too, which was great.BOLLING: Did you watch any of the dinner?PERINO: No. I've just seen the clips, I've seen the highlights. No, I did not go.BOLLING: You were featured in the setup.GUILFOYLE: Very prominently.BOLLING: By the correspondents association.PERINO: Yes, I like the White House Correspondents Association. They asked me if I would say a few words of what I think of the work that they do, which I admire. So, I was happy to do it.BECKEL: You were on the thing?PERINO: It's a video.GUILFOYLE: She was part of a historical video that they put together and it was really great. I thought that was good because you represented FOX News very well and it showed us in a prominent way in a respected position with you working there in the White House.PERINO: Imagine that.GUILFOYLE: That's what I'm saying. People like, they didn't bash on FOX at all. They said like a potted plant saying who cares? And they ripped on MSNBC and CNN.BOLLING: They kind of screwed us on table locations. They were like -- all right.Your thoughts on --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: The best joke Obama delivered was ObamaCare. I mean, that was the punch line for everything. When he brought Sebelius out there to help him fix the Web site, he was -- she had become essentially, her massive incompetence became a sight gag. She's now a seven-figure punch line. A joke they trot out every time.Somehow, that's supposed to make us laugh.GUILFOYLE: That was embarrassing.GUTFELD: What a sad group of chuckling toadies.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: They set up like President Obama --GUILFOYLE: Yes, we didn't like that one.BOLLING: I'm not sure if this was on purpose, but he called for a screen that didn't come up, and then he made a little bit of joke, he goes let's fix this, and he brings out Sebelius.GUTFELD: Can we show President Obama blowing some boogers?GUILFOYLE: What has he talking about?(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)(LAUGHTER)PERINO: What is he doing?GUTFELD: I don't know. I think it's code.PERINO: What is that?GUTFELD: I don't know, but I can watch it forever.GUILFOYLE: You are putting it on repeat.BOLLING: Here's what it is. When you are on a basketball court and you have nowhere else to go with that, you kind of just do that.PERINO: So, that's what that means?BOLLING: I think, he's probably looking at -- what's the --(CROSSTALK)BECKEL: You talk about my bed bugs. I never did that on a basketball court.GUILFOYLE: Can I tell you something, though? It doesn't matter where the tables were, because we had great people at our table. We had Tony Romo. We had that kitty patootie from ""True Blood,"" we had Rick Springfield, Richard Marx.BOLLING: The guy from ""Meet the Millers,"" too.GUILFOYLE: And ""Meet the Millers.""BOLLING: Who has very thick British accent.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: All right. Let's go. Next up, comedian Rob Schneider spoke up against fascism, Obama and progressivism on a radio show Friday. Take a listen.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)ROB SCHNEIDER, COMEDIAN: Democracies don't end well. We are sliding very fast toward fascism. I do think you can look at a government and go, wow, it's out of control now -- and if you do criticize or tend to be not directly along a liberal stand, then, yes, you can get murdered.(END AUDIO CLIP)BOLLING: So, we asked if a strong stand against Obamanomics will hurt Schneider's chances in a very liberal Hollywood.GUILFOYLE: What's the answer?BOLLING: Can we start with Bob --BECKEL: What is he doing now?BOLLING: I don't know.GUILFOYLE: The guy is a (INAUDIBLE).BECKEL: This guy has to get off the idea of trying to do any analysis about types of government, because that was one of the most absurd, discombobulated ridiculous comments I've heard. Why did you pick that today?BOLLING: Fair enough. But that's a story for another time.GUTFELD: I fear it's going to kill his burgeoning film career, Eric. No, but you know what? I'm wading for David Spade come out and then they're going to take the White House. You're going to have Spade, because Chris Kattan and this guy, Rob Schneider.BOLLING: Jon Lovitz.GUTFELD: That's right. It was Jon Lovitz.BOLLING: Were you following along?PERINO: I think I got the gist of his point. It took him a long time to get there.But I don't think it's going to hurt his chances in Hollywood as much as it used to be a problem. For example, your brother, Bob, is going to be on a great new show starting this summer. That wouldn't necessarily have been possible before when things were -- when there wasn't as much competition as there is now and opportunity for lots of different --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: That's true. You have to have money to do it.GUTFELD: Jon Voight didn't come out as a conservative until he was able to. And Eastwood.GUILFOYLE: I think it has made, you know, paved the road for other people to come out that are conservatives.BOLLING: Very good.All right. And this is awesome. Immensely popular series ""24"" will return tonight for a special 12-episode season. Here's a little bite.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I got this from the CPU. What are they?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Design schematics, some kind of multichannel override system. There's 10 modules. It's drones. You were right, Jack. This system can commander up to 10 U.S. drones.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They're planning a full scale attack.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: OK. But let's not forget our favorite 24 scene ever. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BECKEL: This is the boldest diplomatic initiative we've seen in a generation. It could finally lay a foundation for real peace throughout the entire regime.MONICA CROWLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you know, Bob, the president is certainly betting her legacy on the success of these negotiations.UNIDENTIFIED GIRL: Grandpa, (INAUDIBLE) cartoon.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Actually, it is.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: You are a fan of the show.PERINO: I love ""24."" That's the first show I ever TiVo'd. I was working at the White House at the time. It was the only one that we come back. And like on a Saturday, we would watch three or four right in a row. I love -- I hope this reply is going -- this revisiting, I'm trying to look for the word, it's not the sequel, whatever it is, is usually never as good when they try it again.GUILFOYLE: Oh my gosh.GUTFELD: It's like getting back together with an ex.The great thing about Jack Bauer, he would do everything to save a life. He would torture, but that's no longer the way we look at the world. He's a relic. He's a toy in the attic you don't deserve to play it.What's he going to do for 24 hours? File requests for information.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: He can't kill anybody. He's got a request.BOLLING: That's a good point, though. Terrorism was a much bigger deal when this thing was launched.PERINO: Right after 9/11.GUTFELD: He's got Pulitzer. The Snowden reporters.GUILFOYLE: He should just be driving around now in a predator drone. It was ""24"" written on the side.PERINO: You know what he should? What they should do on this new ""24,"" if they really want to get my attention, he should call upon the U.S. Marshals, and all of a sudden, Nick Searcy and Timothy Olyphant will show up from ""Justified"" in London and they will blow people away.GUILFOYLE: And you got the president from ""Scandal.""GUTFELD: They used to do that. Basically have like guests from the ""Brady Bunch"" to visit the Partridge family. They used to that. I love that or I dreamt that.BOLLING: Or they could have guests from ""The Five"" visit ""24.""GUILFOYLE: They should have ""The Five"" on ""24"" as like the news and that would be awkward.PERINO: And then Jack Bauer could be looking quizzically like what the heck are they talking about?GUILFOYLE: And I could date Jack -- I mean, sorry.BOLLING: All right. We'll leave it right there.GUTFELD: Not real.BOLLING: The fight to free another U.S. marine jailed in Mexico.Sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi didn't intend to cross the border with guns in his car. He just made a wrong turn. Now, he's in jail. And Kimberly is going to tell us all about the effort to get him out, coming up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Well, a former Marine heading out to meet some buddies for dinner took a wrong turn at the border and now sits in a Mexican prison. For nearly five weeks, Sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi has been held in Tijuana's La Mesa Penitentiary on weapons charges for allegedly bringing guns across the border. Now, if convicted, he faces up to 21 years in prison. Here is his heartbroken mother explaining her son's ordeal.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JILL TAHMOORESSI, MOTHER OF ANDREW TAHMOORESSI: He said, ""Mom, I got lost. I made a wrong turn. I need you to know I'm at the Mexican border, and the Mexican officials have surrounded my truck. I need you to know in case anything happens to me.""I think both of us thought that they would just let him turn around and go back to America. Now he's chained by all fours, strapped to a cot for 25 days now, uncertain of his future and actually feeling hopeless because of the uncertainty.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: This is how frightening it is. That's why who wants to go down there, make a wrong turn? It's too dangerous and volatile. And now look at this situation. He could be facing 21 years behind bars. What is this family going to do?GUTFELD: It could have been worse, though. He could have driven accidentally into Detroit or perhaps a V.A. parking lot.GUILFOYLE: Similar situation?GUTFELD: This guy, we have to do something about this. I mean, we have -- we have millions of Mexicans here illegally that we treat really, really well. We have one that accidentally took a wrong turn. I think they better make sure they don't harm him, and they better get him back here.GUILFOYLE: Yes, I mean, why is this even taking so long?BECKEL: That's a good point. I mean, we've treated illegal Mexicans who come in here pretty well.This is not the first time this has happened. Remember, last year, it seems to me there was another Marine who was picked up with weapons. He had an antique firearm.But I will say this, that having lived in Texas and been down around the border many times, I can't believe you could make a wrong turn into Mexico. I mean, he must have had a lot of stress on him, because first of all you have to go past the U.S. border point...GUTFELD: Yes.BECKEL: ... and then you get to a Mexican border point. So the idea of making a wrong turn seems to me to be...GUTFELD: He said there was construction and it was night, and so he missed the last...GUILFOYLE: I believe it.GUTFELD: I get lost...GUILFOYLE: I can barely get out of this building.GUTFELD: ... doing a crossword puzzle.BECKEL: Yes, but it's a lot different when you near the Mexican border, because they've clamped down on it so much. But you know, that doesn't mean that the guy, he was under a lot of stress. Apparently, he has a number of different emotional problems, and so maybe that's what happened to him.But I would just say that it's -- I don't think if you were in your right frame of mind you would necessarily drive across the border.BOLLING: It could have been an accident, or he could have forgotten that he had two legal -- legally registered guns in his car at the time. He broke Mexican law by doing it. It seems to me, K.G...GUILFOYLE: Yes.BOLLING: ... it's just a matter of time before this guy gets his day in court. And then they'll most likely let him go?GUILFOYLE: I think it's a tricky situation. It's not that simple. You think that it would be. This just goes to show you, when the stakes are high like this and the politics are involved -- I just hope that the United States acts incisively and swiftly to do something on his behalf. Otherwise, the longer this goes, the worse it's going to look.PERINO: Well, I think his mother did say that she thought the State Department has done a pretty good job. She wasn't complaining...GUILFOYLE: No.PERINO: ... about the State Department. And the State Department showed last time an ability to work it out. It's in no one's interest to allow this to escalate. And our relationship with Mexico, strained in some areas but pretty good and cooperative in the others. So I would imagine that the State Department will be able to get this done.But he was across the border, and you have to respect that the Mexican government has laws, and they have procedures that they want to fulfill. Chained to a bed by all fours is really obscene and if that is...GUTFELD: Don't knock it till you've tried it.BECKEL: You know -- that's another point about this. They put him in the general population.GUILFOYLE: Yes. But here's the thing also. So this is a guy, he's a Marine. He served two tours in Afghanistan, honorably discharged on November 2012. He actually tried to escape. Can you imagine? He's lucky he's not dead. So he tried to escape by climbing over a gate and heading up onto a roof, then onto another one, and he was stopped when they, you know, opened fire on him.BECKEL: My point is that he should never have been put into a general population with the criminals in Mexico. Most of those on that border are pretty heavy drug-related criminals. And of course, the guy was being threatened, and I don't blame him for trying to get away.GUILFOYLE: And Jon Hammar -- Jon Hammar is the other Marine you were referring to that was released with the antique gun.BOLLING: Can you imagine if we enforce our laws the way Mexico enforces theirs?BECKEL: Well, we deport the maximum number we can deport every year.GUILFOYLE: Also to Dana's point, Secretary of State John Kerry is going to be in Mexico on May 21. So there's a big push about whether he will bring that up or pass. Hopefully, they will try and resolve it.PERINO: I would imagine that if the secretary of state is going there May 21, it will be resolved before then.GUILFOYLE: You think? That's why I'm coming back to this.All right. Well, that was a really good block. I liked the way every -- it went really well.BECKEL: Can't beat that. Don't worry about the bed bugs.PERINO: Don't let the bed bugs bite.GUILFOYLE: Big news over the weekend on Condoleezza Rice's commencement controversy. Well, the former secretary of state has pulled out from speaking at Rutgers after protests over her invite. Dana has all -- and I mean all, everything -- the details next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Condoleezza Rice won't be speaking anymore at Rutgers graduation on May 18 following relentless protests from liberal students and professors.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey hey, ho ho, Condi Rice has got to go. Hey hey, ho ho, Condi Rice has got to go.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey hey, ho ho, Condi Rice has got to go. Hey hey, ho ho, Condi Rice has got to go.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey hey, ho ho, Condi Rice has got to go. Hey hey, ho ho, Condi Rice has got to go.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Why didn't they want our first female African-American secretary of state to appear? Well, they blame her along with others during the war on Iraq.The university has stood by Rice during the controversy, but this weekend, she announced she was going to pull out of the event. And she said, ""Commencement should be a time of joyous celebration. Rutgers' invitation to me to speak has become a distraction for the university community at this very special time. I am simply unwilling to detract from it in any way.""Rutgers just announced who will replace her at the ceremony. It's former New Jersey governor, Thomas Kean. He was appointed by President Bush as co-chair of the commission to investigate 9/11, so I guess that will be acceptable to that small...GUILFOYLE: That's sad.PERINO: Surely, you have something about the whole left.GUTFELD: Yes. They're racist.PERINO: And sexist.GUTFELD: Yes. Well, no. They might have had Hillary Clinton in there who supported the war, but they're absolutely racist.By the way, what a mob. What a cowardly mob. If there was a national vote on all college campuses that said only liberals would speak, these people would vote for it, because the Taliban, by comparison, is more flexible than these people.GUILFOYLE: More tolerant.GUTFELD: What does it tell you? They're cowards, because they're scared of any competing opinion or idea that might be different than theirs. They would rather debate themselves, because then there's no way they can be wrong. They're just debating their own stupidity. What a bunch of morons. Sad brutes.PERINO: Interesting, Kimberly, that some people's reaction was that, wow, how classy of Condi Rice to bow out gracefully. But then there was actually others who criticized her for not being brave enough to face up to protesters. I think it was interesting.GUILFOYLE: I don't think that's her job. She's a woman of dignity.PERINO: She speaks at a lot of universities where there are protesters.GUILFOYLE: She absolutely does, but let me tell you something. This is somebody I think that everyone should admire and welcome the opportunity to listen to, because much can be learned from spending time with her, whether it's a commencement speech or any opportunity you have to be in her company.So I'm sad about this, that there isn't a little more tolerance and open-minded thinking at America's universities that they would react in this repugnant way, especially for, as you said, our first female black secretary of state. Why wouldn't you applaud and jump at the opportunity to have her come speak? Especially if you want to promote women's rights, too. They're committing a war against women.PERINO: Interesting point. I like that one. Let me ask Bob. One of the -- some of the students were actually mad at other students for ruining this opportunity for him with the -- on Twitchy (ph) it says, ""So P-I-S-S- E-D, I could scream."" Rutgers student unloads on no rights morons that hijacked graduation.GUTFELD: You spelled it.BECKEL: There's a couple of things that occurred to me here. First of all, it's -- these people probably represent not a majority of the people on campus.GUTFELD: They still exercise tyranny.BECKEL: Well, they -- you call it tyranny.GUILFOYLE: They chilled speech.GUTFELD: A minority.BECKEL: They have every right in the world to go out to march against anybody they want to march against. So -- and I think Condoleezza Rice has, in fact, gone to universities and had protests and went through them.PERINO: A lot.BECKEL: But let's also keep in mind, to defend Rutgers here for a minute. They voted to continue to keep her...PERINO: Yes, that's true.BECKEL: ... on as the convention speaker, and she decided not to go. I think, you know, by doing that, I think she -- frankly, she does leave herself open to a little controversy.GUTFELD: Good point.PERINO: I have an idea that I wanted to run by you, this would be good for universities everywhere. They would save a lot of money.Let's just say that you have a vote on whatever social media -- take your pick -- of what university students all across America, who's the one speaker they would like to hear. Pay that one person one fee, have them do it on YouTube, and then universities actually don't have to spend any money on a commencement speaker.BOLLING: Not a bad idea. Or poll the university, poll the student -- poll the seniors that are graduating: Would you want to hear from Condi Rice or former Governor Kean? Which would you rather? I would bet that they would rather hear from Condi Rice.No matter what your politics are, no matter what you feel about the war, I would rather hear what a smart, young successful African-American female who made it to secretary of state had to say, especially if I'm about to go out into the world, than, frankly, there are a lot of Governor Keans.BECKEL: And colleges spend millions of dollars a year on speakers' fees.PERINO: I know. That's what I'm saying, that they could save a lot of money with my idea, because it is brilliant.GUTFELD: Including Snooki. Remember, Rutgers -- Rutgers paid Snooki but not Condoleezza.GUILFOYLE: How sad is that?GUTFELD: Snooki could throw up in a water bed.PERINO: If you're one of those students who's upset at the others for ruining your opportunity to hear from Condi Rice, she's written two books: one about her parents and upbringing and education, the other about her time as secretary of state and in government. I recommend those.So, still ahead: Ben Affleck in big trouble at one casino in Las Vegas. What the actor might have been caught doing in Sin City, coming up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BECKEL: There's an update on those 276 girls kidnapped in Nigeria, a story that's finally got the world paying attention.Today the leader of the Islamic terror group Boko Haram claimed responsibility for the mass abduction on April 15. He's threatening to sell the schoolgirls into marriage.The White House says America is doing what it can to find them. We tried to contact a couple of Muslim countries' embassies. We didn't get calls back.We did, though, get a call -- we called CAIR, the group that I usually jump on here on a regular basis. They did issue a fairly strong statement about condemning what happened here. They also, in the course of the conversation, their communications director, Ibrahim Hooper, decided to take it off on one of our producers and took on me personally and took on ""The Five.""And let me say this, Mr. Hooper, if you want to take me on, call me. You don't have to jump on a producer. That's a cowardly to go about it.But anyway, having said that, still there has not been -- the Nigerian president apparently is working very hard to get these girls freed. But I still don't get a sense that there's an uproar in the Muslim community about this around the world. Anybody got a thought about that?You just want to let me be the one who's going to get assassinated.GUTFELD: They treat radical Islam like it's their dumb violent brother. You know, it's like, ""Oh, we have nothing to do with them."" But they won't stop them. And that's what's wrong.It's not a war on women. It's a war on civilization. We have to admit that. And thanks to, Islamaphobia-phobia, so many of our elites here are frightened by a disgusting, aggressive, creepy group of people.BECKEL: You're getting close to joining me on the fatwa. But I think I'm still there by myself.GUILFOYLE: This is unconscionable. I'm glad that you're bringing it up and that some of the mainstream media is starting to cover it. This is, I think, an outrage. It's disgusting what's happened to these girls. It was gang rape and torture. Many of the 200 that were taken are said to be pregnant. Some escaped and went back to tell of the horrors that they experienced.This should not be OK, not even for one more second. And I think where leadership has to come from Muslims to say that this is not OK.BECKEL: Let me ask to both Eric and Dana this question. I've posed this over and over again. Is the silence in the Muslim communities in the countries because they are afraid of these people or because they agree with them? Dana, let me start with you.PERINO: Well, it could also be that they feel that they're incapable and unequipped to be able to stop it. I mean, they are dealing with a population that lives off of less than a dollar a day, and they're trying to -- people are just trying to feed themselves.It's a whole different type of law enforcement and intelligence and military capability that we're talking about.I will note, Bob, that the United States and Britain apparently have said they have promised unspecified help. I home that what that means is that our intel and SEAL Team 6 or some group like that is actually on the case and will be able to try to help them a little bit more specifically and then talk about it later.BECKEL: Eric, what do you think?BOLLING: A couple quick thoughts. So this terrorist group says they're going to sell these girls into slavery. Who's going to be the buyer? You want to also try and close that loop, let everyone know. Let them know if you're caught with one of these girls, they're going to prosecute you, really take you down.Also, where's the U.N.? I mean, the U.N. is very...GUTFELD: They're buying the girls.PERINO: Don't forget, they're worried about climate change over there.BOLLING: Right, that's my point. They spend so much time on climate change and things that have no consequence. Here's something that has consequence. How about U.N. step up and find these girls?BECKEL: Well, the only...GUILFOYLE: Yes, do something for us.BECKEL: The only good news that comes out of this is maybe now finally the media and other nations will start to stand up about this thing, because it has been going on too long, and these Islamic terrorists are punks. And they need to be brought to justice, and you need to do it.""One More Thing"" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: ""One More Thing."" Dana, kick it off, please.PERINO: You're going to love this ""One More Thing."" I read this op- ed in the ""Wall Street Journal"" this morning, and I encourage everyone to look at it. Caleb Rossiter is the one who wrote it. He is with a group that -- it's right here. He is -- he's a professor, actually, one of the whole (ph) left. And he's the American Exceptionalism Media Project.What he's talking about in this piece is how he believes that western policies like in the United States seem more interested in carbon levels than they do in life expectancy, in particular in Africa, and that the policies here are so warped towards global warming that we are sacrificing lives all over the world of people that actually could be living healthier lives while we also try to reduce carbon dioxide levels.Why is this important? Tomorrow, President Obama is going to do interviews with meteorologists all over the country about a new climate change report.GUTFELD: Yes, because the science is settled.PERINO: I hope they ask him about Benghazi.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: A weatherman from, like, Montana, should ask him about Benghazi.GUTFELD: K.G.GUILFOYLE: All right. So I think this is a great story. It just goes to show you when you put your mind to something, you can overcome just about anything, and this is a story of Lieutenant Joshua Pitcher, who lost his foot after it was blown apart two years ago by an IED.He vowed to return to Afghanistan, and he did just that. He's one of only 57 soldiers who have had amputations who returned to active duty. And imagine serving every day in the desert like that, and having those heavy packs on. He's a U.S. Army paratrooper, and he's back serving the country. And he went through a lot of obstacles, too, with OxyContin and other things and he overcome it all.PERINO: It's amazing. For the parents to write a book about how do you raise a kid like that.BOLLING: Very quickly, I want to rush this. A couple of sights from the White House correspondents' dinner. Some pictures I took. On the upper -- oh, boy. Anyway, it was Arianna -- there we go. Barbara Walters on the upper left of her screen, Arianna Huffington.GUILFOYLE: Willie.BOLLING: And Senator Rand Paul's group on the upper right. Willie I know -- I noticed. And Tebow. And this one, my favorite of all, and also ""USA Today's"" favorite picture of Al Roker.GUILFOYLE: I showed Al that on the plane ride home, and he wife said, ""What are you doing, Al?""BECKEL: You know, you're like doggie heaven when you do that thing.PERINO: Dog and what?BECKEL: Doggie heaven.GUILFOYLE: I cede my time.BECKEL: I was going to cede, too. I'll give up my time.GUTFELD: All right. I was just going to say I lost a friend today, my glasses. I got trifocal contact lenses, and I can't see anything. All I know is I pulled a Beckel. I hit my head on a massage parlor door on Saturday.BECKEL: See, that's what happens.GUTFELD: Yes.BECKEL: You've got to do those things a lot better.GUTFELD: Talk about not a happy ending.Bye-bye.
