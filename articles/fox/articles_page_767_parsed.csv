This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MIKE HUCKABEE, GUEST HOST: And welcome to this special edition of ""Hannity"": Road to the White House.""Hello, everyone. I'm Mike Huckabee, and I'm in tonight for Sean.With 87 days to go before the general election, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is pounding the campaign trail. Mr. Trump has been very busy talking to voters in several key swing states, and earlier today, he held a couple of big rallies in Pennsylvania. Here's a look at some of the highlights.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I spent less and won in a landslide! Other people spent much, much more, three, four, five times more, and they came in seventh! Who the hell do you want to have as your president, right?(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: You signed a pledge, I hereby guarantee that I will endorse whoever wins. You know, the funny thing, all those pledges -- you know they were signed for -- they were signed so that I would sign it. And I would have honored it, I will say.You know, the Republicans do have a tougher path, just so you -- not my fault. Not my fault. It's a tougher path. For the presidency, it's just a tougher, winding road.But if we win Pennsylvania, we win Florida, where we're doing really well, I think we can win Ohio. It'll be over.Has anybody lied as much as Hillary Clinton? Has anybody?CROWD: No!TRUMP: You look at the FBI director, and you see what went on with the e- mails. You see how she got away with that. I think that that will go down in her career as her single greatest achievement, how she got out of that mess.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUCKABEE: Well, this week, I got to spend some time campaigning with Donald Trump, and I had a chance to sit down with the Republican nominee to ask him how he plans to win the White House and a whole lot more. Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HUCKABEE: In the interests of full disclosure, I think I've got to tell people that I've been out campaigning with you for the past couple of days. So it's not like I'm objective. I'm not pretending or even playing the role of a journalist.TRUMP: Well, that's good. I like that.HUCKABEE: Your stamina is pretty amazing. You're doing events starting early in the morning. Wednesday night, we didn't finish dinner until well after midnight. And I've watched you through this process. Where do you get that stamina to do this?TRUMP: Well, I sometimes say when people ask me, do I have a choice, right? I mean, it's, like, it's set up and we have to do it. And it's so important. We have 90 days left, and I want to maximize the time.And it's so important for the country, whether it's Supreme Court justices or evangelicals -- because you know we were at the big evangelical meeting with the pastors a little while ago. So many things happening on that front, and so many things happening on so many fronts. And I just feel that I have no choice. I have to really go full blast and get this thing done because we will make America great again.We'll make America greater than ever before. And if Hillary Clinton gets in, it's a disaster. It's going to be four more years of Obama. It's going to be horrible, super-left judges on the Supreme Court. They're going to destroy the country. And so we have to get it done.HUCKABEE: Look, the reason I bring up this whole issue of stamina is because the president of the United States is a very demanding job.TRUMP: Right.HUCKABEE: It's a demanding job physically, emotionally, spiritually, politically. I see people that work for you, they're half your age, and at the end of the day, I mean, they're dragging. You're still going strong.I mean, what I'm trying to point out is that this is a job that requires somebody who is physically capable of having that kind of pressure. Now, I've seen this.TRUMP: Right.HUCKABEE: How important do you think it is for the American people to understand the -- just the physical capacity of their president?TRUMP: Well, you have to have that, and you have to have great strength. You're dealing with so many different problems and lots of other things, but in particular, problems. And you know, you have countries like China that have been taking advantage of us for years. You have to deal with that situation. We can't continue to have trade deficits of $500 billion a year. You have ISIS, where they're getting bigger and bigger, even though Obama is trying to convince people that they're not. Now they're in, I understand, 28 countries. It went from 8 to 28 in a short period of time.You have so many different difficulties that if you don't have the stamina, if you don't have the whatever that is that you have to have, the country's in trouble. Not you, the country's in trouble.And I've always said that Hillary doesn't have the stamina. I've said that for a long time. But you just need a great deal of strength to -- you know, for us to come out a winner.Look at what happens. We lose on everything. We lose on trade. We can't beat ISIS militarily. Our vets aren't taken care of. Our borders are weak. ""Obama care"" is a disaster. It's got to be repealed and replaced with something much better and much less expensive for the people. We have a lot of things to take care of. You need big stamina.HUCKABEE: You have two opponents. You've got Hillary Clinton, but you've also got the media.TRUMP: Right. That's a bigger opponent.HUCKABEE: I mean, they're never the friend of the politician. But in my many years of doing politics, I've never seen anything like the kind of targeted attacks that have come upon you, misconstruing virtually everything you say. A good example this week, you made the comment that Barack Obama is the founder of ISIS. Now, you didn't mean physically that he's the founder of ISIS. You meant it very clearly, his policies.TRUMP: Everybody knew exactly what I meant. Well, actually, that's been covered, I think, pretty well. I think really -- you know, when he -- look, we should have never been Iraq. I was against going into Iraq. It was a big mistake.But when he took it over, the way he got out was horrible, horrible, and it really led to the formation, the real formation of ISIS as we know it. And you look at the way that happened, and you look at the weakness, and then you see the way it grows.They tried to hide how they've grown. And it's weakness. It's just weakness. We have to knock them out. We have no choice. We have to knock them out. We have to knock them out strongly.But we have a depleted military. He's allowed our military to become totally depleted. I think he's just been a terrible president. He's made so many mistakes. And she'll be worse than him. She will be worse than Barack Obama.HUCKABEE: Earlier in the week, in Detroit at the economic club, you presented an economic plan that included significant tax cuts for everybody, but especially for businesses.TRUMP: Right.HUCKABEE: Small businesses, down to 15 percent.TRUMP: And middle income people, especially for them, too. But you're right, for businesses. Absolutely.HUCKABEE: Why is that important?TRUMP: Because they're going to spur jobs like you haven't seen. You know, we have no growth. Our country right now, Mike -- and you and I were discussing the numbers before -- 1.2 percent. That's basically no growth. If China ever had 1.2 percent, there would be a revolution. They get down to 7 percent or 8 percent growth, and it's like a big deal. They start devaluing and do all sorts of things to take more jobs out of the United States so that they can go longer.No, we have 1.2 percent growth. Essentially, that's no growth. We could be heading even lower than that. That means we're a stagnant country. We have millions and millions of people out of the workforce. They can't get jobs, and yet statistically, it looks like 5 percent, but it's not 5 percent. It's probably 21 percent. It's a massive number.People give up looking for jobs, and the jobs that they have are bad jobs. And every admits that. Even the other side admits that. They're bad jobs. They're not good jobs. The good jobs have left to a large extent.So we have a lot of things to do, and we're going to do them. And we're going to straighten things out. But we really -- we have to get a whole different mindset, and Hillary Clinton literally will be four more years of Obama.That means high taxes. She wants to -- did you see yesterday, where she wants to double up taxes? You know, and double taxes won't take care of what she's doing. I mean, people's taxes are going to be doubled, if not more than that.So we have to win this election. We have to put the right judges on the Supreme Court, et cetera, et cetera. There's so many things to do.HUCKABEE: When you spoke about in Detroit and talked about the economic plans, you were doing that in a city that once was the world's center of manufacturing.TRUMP: Not anymore.HUCKABEE: Called the arsenal of democracy. I mean, Michigan basically saved America by being able to build our armaments during World War II.TRUMP: Right.HUCKABEE: How do we get manufacturing back to a level where we're making things in America like Michigan once did?TRUMP: Well, it was a great place, Detroit, many years ago. And now our great car companies are building cars in Germany and other places. And you look at the -- you look at even the unions, the number of people that they have today compared to 10 years ago and 20 years ago. You take a look at hundreds of thousands of people less.And Mexico is the eighth wonder of the world. A friend of mine who builds plants, he builds big plants, he tells me Mexico, what they're doing in Mexico is amazing. They're taking our businesses.And our politicians have no idea how to handle it, and it's so simple. It's so simple. But one of the reasons they don't have any idea -- probably number one they don't have an idea, but number two, they're controlled by special interests and lobbyists and donors, and they don't want to handle it. So a place like Michigan is losing its jobs.Hillary will do nothing about it. There was a story in the Washington Post two days ago which was shocking because the Washington Post never writes badly about Hillary. But there was a story in The Washington Post which tells you how badly she did as a senator from New York, that she promised upstate New York that she would bring jobs back, and she would do all sorts of things.And upstate New York is a catastrophe right now, probably as bad as just about anyplace. It's a catastrophe, and the jobs have left -- 50, 60 percent of the manufacturing is gone.And she promised to take care of that situation and made it worse, except her friends did very well. Consultants and various other people, they made a fortune.So no, she won't do the job. She's all talk. She's no action. I know her well. Not going to happen.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUCKABEE: All right, coming up, part two of my interview with Donald Trump from the campaign trail.And then later...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We're going to build it up, and we're going to make it strong, and we're going to make it powerful. And hopefully, we're not going to use it other than to knock the hell out of ISIS. We have no choice.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HUCKABEE: Donald Trump says he's going to defeat ISIS. Now, this comes as a new congressional report finds that military officials manipulated the data to make ISIS look like less of a threat. Dr. Sebastian Gorka and General Tony Tata will be with us with their reaction.That and much more as this special edition of ""Hannity"" continues.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HUCKABEE: And welcome back to this special edition of ""Hannity: Road to the White House."" Now, here's part two of my interview from the campaign trail with Republican nominee Donald Trump. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HUCKABEE: One of the things that has been amazing being on the trail with you is watching the rallies. A lot of people see them on TV, so they see the podium. But the cameras never pull back and let people see what 20,000 people screaming are like at a political rally.And I'm curious, what is your -- what's your understanding -- what is it that Americans are saying when they come and they're acting like -- almost like groupies at a Rolling Stones concert? I mean, I have nothing to compare this to. I've been to a lot of political events. Nothing is going on that I've ever seen quite like at one of those rallies. What is it about them?TRUMP: Well, right now, right after this, you're going to be introducing me in front of 12,000 or 13,000 people in Orlando, and it's -- and that's not even -- you know, I mean, we have 25,000, we have 30,000, we have 40,000 people.HUCKABEE: Whatever the seating capacity is, you have that and then you have people sitting outside.TRUMP: We're restricted by seating capacity, I mean, basically. I mean, it's been an amazing experience.You mentioned one thing, though. It's very funny because if I had a network, I'd want to show all the crowds because it's going to be better television. They never pull it away from my face. They have it on my face. And I'll go home, and I'll say to my wife, Did you see what I did? She said, Yes, how big was the crowd? They never show it, unless there's a protester. They show the protester because that's a bad thing. In other words, if you have a protester, they consider it a bad thing.So if there's a protester -- we don't have too many protesters. You notice? We haven't -- we had a little surge, but -- and the Hillary people don't have the same passion.(CROSSTALK)HUCKABEE: The reason you don't have any protesters is because there aren't that many people. 100 people show up.TRUMP: They really don't. Yes, it's amazing. She doesn't have big crowds. The whole thing is strange to me because she doesn't have big crowds.But they never show the size of the crowd, and you would think they'd want to because it's better television. It's good for ratings, et cetera, et cetera. But they never want to -- they pull that camera back unless there's a protester.But we've had tremendous -- there's tremendous -- I'll tell you what. The level of spirit for our country, the level of love for our country -- you see the people. They're in love with this whole -- I'm a messenger. I'm a messenger. I'm merely a messenger. I'm a messenger of ideas that they've wanted for years.You know, many of these people haven't had a pay increase. And they're making less money now than they made 18 years ago in real wages. And they're working much harder and they have two jobs. ""Obama care"" is taking care of that. But they have literally two jobs.So they're getting older, they're working harder and they're making less money. And it's very, very sad. And we have -- look, we have all people. We have everybody. You know, they like to say that we have people, this, and that they like to -- we have everybody.But so many people today are working harder than they did 18 years ago, and they're making less money. And it's not supposed to be that way. And they're angry, and they're upset.But we're going to change it. We're not going to let our jobs go. There are going to be consequences. When countries come in and they take our business, there are going to be consequences. Right now, there are no consequences. And it's so easy to handle. And we're not going to let them make their product and just send it right across our borders and sell it into our country. And we end up with unemployment. We end up with grief. We end up with no taxes. We end up with so many different difficulties.So it's so easy to solve. Everybody understands that. The politicians don't do it because their lobbyists and their donors don't want them to do it because they benefit on the other side. But me, I'm putting up my money to run my campaign, and I don't care about the lobbyists and I don't care about the special interests, as you know.HUCKABEE: Yes, it's been pretty apparent that that's not been the driving force, and I think it's one of the reasons that people have been supportive. You're a disruptive candidate. You're disrupting the institutions that have failed America, and they see that and they believe it.On a personal level, at the end of the day, when you're absolutely given a 20-hour day, which I've seen you now do...TRUMP: Right.HUCKABEE: ... what is it that gives you the satisfaction of believing, I'm glad I'm doing this?TRUMP: The people are so thrilled. You'll see that in 20 minutes when we go into the -- this massive place where we have all these people. A friend of mine came and said, you know, How do you get up and speak without even looking at notes or without teleprompters, and you have all of these people, thousands, 10,000, 5,000, 25,000, 35,000? And he's a very successful person.And he came to one of the rallies about two months ago, and he saw these thousands of people. I said, you know, it's easy because there's so much love in the room. And you understand that. You've seen it. There's so much love in the room.They want to see America be great again. You know, my whole theme is make America great again, and I've added to it. America first. We make deals where we -- we're making deals, it's almost like we're making them for other countries. We have trade deficits that are massive with Mexico and with Japan and with China, with Vietnam, with everybody.And it's -- it's almost like, are they doing this on purpose? How can anybody be so foolish or so stupid? And we're going to change it around.But we have make America great again, make America safe again. America first. We have to say safe again, too. When you see what Hillary Clinton wants to have come into the country -- she wants people to come in from the migration. We have no idea who these people are. They have no paperwork. There's no way of vetting them. You know. You've spoken to the same top law enforcement officials as I have.And she wants to increase what Obama is letting in, which is thousands. She wants to increase it by 550 percent. It's not going to happen.HUCKABEE: Thank you very much. Great to visit with you.TRUMP: Thank you very much, Mike.HUCKABEE: Good to see you.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUCKABEE: Well, it was a lot of fun being on the trail with Donald Trump. I enjoyed it and appreciate his time.Coming up next on this special edition of ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We're going to build it up, and we're going to make it strong, and we're going to make it powerful, and hopefully, we're not going to use it other than to knock the hell out of ISIS. We have no choice.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HUCKABEE: Well, Donald Trump promises to get tough on ISIS as a new congressional report shows that military officials altered intelligence reports. That was to make the fight against ISIS look more successful. Dr. Sebastian Gorka and General Tony Tata is going to -- they'll be both be with us with reaction to that.And then later...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hillary, your response to Donald's...(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You make me listen to him for 25 minutes. That was torture! So unfair.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You loved every minute of it!(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're clearly in the business of torture.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUCKABEE: The liberal mainstream media continues an all-out attack on Donald Trump. Larry Elder and Doug Schoen -- they're going to join us.That and more as ""Hannity"" continues.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Here we have a world where ISIS is chopping off the heads of Christians and many others, drowning people in steel cages, burying people in the sand, and we have somebody up there who wants to be our president that says, I don't like Donald Trump's tone.They had eight states. They had eight countries. They're now in 28 countries! They're expanding!We're going to win with our military, which I said before is very, very depleted. But we're going to build it up, and we're going to make it strong, and we're going to make it powerful, and hopefully, we're not going to use it other than to knock the hell out of ISIS. We have no choice.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HUCKABEE: Well, that was Donald Trump out on the campaign trail earlier today discussing ISIS. His comments come as a stunning House GOP report finds that U.S. Central Command manipulated and distorted key data about the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria in order to minimize the threat that the radical Islamic group poses.Congressman Mike Pompeo told Fox News yesterday that the goal was, I quote, ""tell a story that ISIS was the JV and that we had Al Qaeda on the run.""Joining us with reaction is the author of ""Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War,"" professor of strategy of irregular warfare at the Institute of World Politics, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, and the author of the book, ""Three Minutes to Midnight,"" retired brigadier general Tony Tata.General, let me start with you. This seems to be an incredible report that shows that intelligence data was cooked for the express purpose of politicizing and making things seem better than they really were.BRIG. GEN. TONY TATA, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Governor, unfortunately, it's very credible. And it's just the tip of the iceberg. I have very well placed sources inside this thing that tell me that someone from the office of the director of national intelligence, who frequently meets with the president, directed a senior official in Central Command to quit producing products of record, as they're called, that showed negative intelligence that did not fit the narrative of the Obama administration.And so what you have here is a directive from the administration to cook the books. It's not within Central Command alone. And so you get this clashing that has led to this climate that the report -- and you know, I've read about the entire report. It talks about this toxic climate.And you have majors and lieutenant colonels and sergeants who just want to do the right thing for their country and aren't worried about their report cads, that clashes now with the directed narrative, and they're told not to produce anything that doesn't fit the junior varsity narrative that the president is putting out. And you have people that are being reprised against that or being retaliated against. To this day, this retaliation is still going on.HUCKABEE: General, this apparently is a top-down, not a bottom-up type of operation. How far to the top does it go? Does it go to the White House? At whose feet does this land?TATA: Well, my sources tell me it goes all the way to the top. And so...HUCKABEE: You're talking the president?TATA: I'm talking the commander-in-chief, you know, who wants the junior varsity narrative out there. It's verifiable that the office of DNI told a CENTCOM senior official to do not produce products of record. You got any bad news for me, call me, but don't put it on the record.And you've got the Arab spring that's happening. You've got the Syrian civil war that's happening. So really, what's happened is the chaotic way we left Iraq notwithstanding, you know, the Clinton/Obama narrative is that the war in Iraq has bred ISIS. That's just not the case.What this verifies is that President Obama and his administration, to include Secretary Clinton at the time, turned the other way purposefully, told other people, Do not tell me how bad it is. We want a good narrative here because we just want to forget about it. And now that allowed ISIS to take root while we were looking the other way. Talk about fiddling while Rome is burning.HUCKABEE: All right, Dr. Gorka, this is like a golfer fudging the scorecard. And we know President Obama loves to play golf. But this is a dangerous practice. I mean, does he not endanger people on the battlefield by making up stuff about what our enemy is really like?SEBASTIAN GORKA, ""DEFEATING JIHAD"" AUTHOR: Well, I know the commander-in- chief likes to golf, but this act of willfully distorting and playing down the intelligence assessments when America is at war is tantamount to being a treasonous act.If during World War II, somebody had been ordering our intelligence community to water down the assessments of what the Japanese were doing or what Hitler was doing, if that person were found out, they could have been court-martialed and they could have been executed.This is political interference in the intelligence cycle. It is absolutely outrageous, and it will endanger American lives. It is clear the administration will brook no information that undermines the narrative that their policies are winning, when, at the same time, ISIS has become the Godzilla of international jihad -- 80,000 jihadis, territory with six million people on their new caliphate, and with attacks happening outside the war zone every 84 hours.That's the truth. That's the reality. But it doesn't match the White House narrative. Therefore, it must be sunk. It must be censored.HUCKABEE: Dr. Gorka, I've only got about 30 seconds, but I've got to ask this question. If I were a Democrat trying to defend this, I might say, Look, it's always been the role of the commander-in-chief to put the best foot forward, to try to give the American people confidence. So why is that not an acceptable explanation for what happened? And we've only got a few seconds.GORKA: Yes, there's always rallying the troops and convincing the nation that this is important and that we can win. But that has nothing to do with the censorship of intelligence. Those are two completely different things, and the latter can cost people lives.HUCKABEE: That is frightening. And from both you and the general, we get a disturbing report. I'm anxious to see if the mainstream media is going to cover this. Are they going to really put the spotlight on the fact that we have been lied to?But more importantly than we the American people have been lied to -- we've been lied to a lot, but the lies were being told up and down the chain of command all the way to the people who were out on the battlefield, and soldiers and intelligence officers who every day risk their lives essentially were being told to simply make up a fairy tale, create a narrative because the truth was not good for the politics of this administration! If every American isn't angry by that, I don't know what could make them mad.Coming up next on this special edition of ""Hannity"" --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This was certainly not the confident winner that Donald Trump usually presents himself as. He was practically pleading for votes.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUCKABEE: Well, the liberal mainstream media once again proves it is blatantly biased against Donald Trump. Larry Elder and Doug Schoen are going to weigh in on that next.And then later --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: For everybody of religion, this will be maybe the most important election that our country has ever had. So go out and spread the word.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUCKABEE: Donald Trump courting religious voters. Reverend Franklin Graham, Dr. Robert Jeffress, and the president of the American Renewal Project David Lane are here with reaction, that and more as this special edition of HUCKABEE continues.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HUCKABEE: Welcome back to this special edition of ""Hannity: Road to the White House."" We are less than three months away from when the voters are going to head to the polls. But with each passing day some so-called journalists in the mainstream media are getting more and more biased against Donald Trump. Here's just a few examples from this week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to begin today with the politics lead, and today's installment of Donald Trump's controversial comments. The big question today, tongue-in-cheek or foot-in-mouth?The Republican presidential nominee now saying he did not mean literally that President Obama founded ISIS when he repeatedly said that president Obama founded ISIS, literally.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So if he stayed on message, David, instead of what he calls sarcasm, he could probably make some strong points.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This was certainly not the confident winner that Donald Trump usually presents himself as. He was practically pleading for votes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hillary, your response to Donald's --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You make me listen to him for 25 minutes. That was torture. So unfair.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You loved every minute of it.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're clearly in the business of torture.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We ought to start at home with Donald Trump and a potential new controversy simmering tonight after a remark that at best was a joke and at worst was an implied threat of violence.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUCKABEE: The amazing thing is we could have run an hour of those clips and still not had them all. Joining me with reaction are radio national syndicated host Larry Elder and FOX News contributor and former Clinton pollster Doug Schoen. Doug, let me jump into this with you. You've been in this business a long, long time. You've seen a lot of stuff.DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Sure.HUCKABEE: But you're a fair guy even though you're unapologetically a Democrat. Is the mainstream media treatment of Donald Trump unique in your worldview?SCHOEN: The way I would say it is they've certainly been harsh and hostile, and Donald Trump, between his comments about the Second Amendment and ISIS, has allowed that, in fact, to happen. He has been discursive, off the cuff, when he shouldn't be. This is a business, as we were saying before. He has played into them and allowed them to attack him.I wish, governor, that they talked about the issues, both sides, because when we fight the way we are, you know who loses? The American people. With this kind of rhetoric, we are now facing a resurgent Russia that's potentially going to go back into Ukraine. ISIS, as you've been discussing, is a serious threat, underestimated. We're not talking about. We all lose. So, yes, you're right in your premise. But Donald, unfortunately, has played into it.HUCKABEE: Larry Elder, around these parts, we sometimes use the term ""fair and balanced."" I just wonder if you want to weigh in. Do you think the media has been fair and balanced in their treatment of Hillary Clinton? I mean it's not like she has had nothing to answer for this week.LARRY ELDER, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: No, they haven't been fair and balanced. Hillary has a lot of issues out there that the people who have attacked Donald Trump haven't even broached. I will mention something that might make our friend Doug a little uncomfortable, and that is that Bill Clinton was credibly accused of rape by a woman named Juanita Broaddrick in the 1980s. ""Dateline NBC"" did a TV show about. And she said two weeks after this alleged rape, Hillary verbally intimidated her. There hasn't been, governor, a single reporter, not one, who has ever asked Hillary about the veracity of the allegation.This is a woman, Hillary, who once said, when women make allegations of sexual assault, they should be believed and they should be supported. I'm not saying Broaddrick is telling the truth. I'm saying I defy you to make the same allegation against Donald Trump and have zero reporters ever ask him about it. That's just one of many issues.HUCKABEE: Doug, Hillary hasn't answered a whole lot. First of all, she doesn't do a press conference. She doesn't make herself available to a lot of interviews. Donald Trump does, but he gets no credit for that, none at all.SCHOEN: Hillary Clinton is now about six or seven points ahead. She answered a couple of questions last Friday and got herself in some trouble with her answers on the e-mails and Director Comey and her needing her own reset. So why should she? She's trying to win, not win a prize for, you know, good conduct.And, again, I go back to what I said. Larry, it's certainly fair to raise those issues, but this is an election about war and peace and the economy, not what her husband allegedly did, and I underscore allegedly, many years ago. I wish we talked about the real problems facing this country.HUCKABEE: We all do. Larry, go ahead.ELDER: Doug, you just said this is about winning an election. One more time, had there been a similar allegation made about Donald Trump, it certainly would have been brought up. Paul Begala was a top aide for Bill Clinton, and when Mitt Romney was running in 2012, he brought up some 40- year-old allegation about Mitt Romney allegedly as a teenager holding down some gay kid and cutting his hair. Romney didn't even remember it. The gay kid's family said he never reported it. Paul Begala mentioned it on CNN and then wrote an article that said, once a bully, always a bully. This allegation against Hillary about Juanita Broaddrick and others are out there and they don't even raise the question.All I'm saying is there's no consistency here. It's not fair. We're talking about winning an election. When you win an election, you bring up issues that hurt your opponent. This is an issue that would hurt Hillary, and it hasn't even been mentioned by the media. It's not fair.HUCKABEE: Well, Doug, if you were advising Donald Trump, which I know you're not.SCHOEN: I'm not, no.HUCKABEE: But if you were, what would you say to him when it's not going to be fair and it's not going to be equal?SCHOEN: Here's what I would say. First, my answer to Donald would be talk about the economy, talk about jobs, talk about growth, and talk about foreign policy and stopping terror.To Larry's comment, if the Democrats do it, it's wrong. If the Republicans do it, it's wrong. I find the whole line of conversation that he was raising to be abhorrent, whichever side does it in a presidential election, and I hope we can talk about the real problems. That's right for the country. It also is the best advice I could give Donald Trump.HUCKABEE: I will pass it along.SCHOEN: Please do.HUCKABEE: Thank you both. Great to have you both here.Coming up next on this special edition of ""Hannity"".(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: For everybody of religion, this will be maybe the most important election that our country's ever had. So go out and spread the word.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUCKABEE: Donald Trump reaching out to religious voters. Reverend Franklin Graham, Dr. Robert Jeffress, and the president of the American Renewal Project, David Lane, are going to be here next with reaction, that and more as ""Hannity"" continues.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HUCKABEE: Welcome back to this special edition of ""Hannity: Road to the White House."" Donald Trump continues to reach out to religious voters. Yesterday he was in Florida where he spoke to hundreds of evangelical leaders at an event put together by the American Renewal Project. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: For everybody of religion, this will be maybe the most important election that our country's ever had. So go out and spread the word. You have to get the people in your churches, you have to get them to go out and vote. Whether you have bus drives, do whatever you have to do.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUCKABEE: Joining me now, the president of Samaritan's Purse, Reverend Franklin Graham, the president and founder of the American Renewal Project, David Lane, and FOX News contributor Dr. Robert Jeffress. He's a member of Trump's evangelical advisory board.David Lane, let me start with you. You have rarely done television interviews. In fact you have avoided the press about like Hillary has. But tonight we get you on, and you just hosted that event where Donald Trump was speaking in Orlando yesterday. How did he connect to the pastors in your view?DAVID LANE, AMERICAN RENEWAL PROJECT: I thought he did well. Thank you, governor, for having me on. He used a term which I hadn't heard before in the repeal of the Johnson amendment. He talked about leverage, that pastors in America have been neutered and lost their leverage.And so he connected well. He did well. As you know, there's nothing good or bad about the Democrat Party. There's nothing good or bad about the Republican Party. They're holding vessels that you pour things into like my constituents. Evangelical Christians and prolife Catholic Christians are not housed in the Democrat Party. They don't believe anything that we believe. So evangelicals, the estimated 65 million to 80 million evangelicals who are going to turn America are going to have to get registered and vote.HUCKABEE: Franklin, you have conducted rallies and prayer meetings across the country at state capitols. And by the way, I want to acknowledge that none of the three of you have officially endorsed a candidate. You may have a preference but you have not gone out and officially endorsed a candidate. But Franklin, in the rallies where you've been speaking to people at state capitals, what are people saying to you? What is it they're worried about?REV. FRANKLIN GRAHAM, SAMARITAN'S PURSE: Thank you, governor. I was just in Cheyenne, Wyoming, today. People are fed up. People realize that our political system is broken. Both the Republican Party is broken, the Democratic Party is broken. Our process is broken. And the only hope for the country is almighty God and his son, Jesus Christ. And I think this election is going to come down, really, governor, to the debates and when they can see candidates side by side answering questions from a fair moderator and hope the election commission will put a fair moderator in there. And I would vote for our friend Greta Van Susteren. She is absolutely fair and there's no drama with her. But it's going to come down to I think the debates.But our country is broken. And I have been leading these prayer rallies. I was in Cheyenne today, and I'll be up in the northeast next week. And you see thousands of people coming out at noon to stand on the capitol grounds to pray. And people realize we're in trouble and God is the only one who can fix this, governor. He's the only one to fix it.HUCKABEE: I would love to second the motion for Greta Van Susteren but I know that if I did that would absolutely kill any chances she would ever have to be one of the moderators. Great suggestion.Robert Jeffress, I know you hear some of the same things I do from some people, particularly, evangelicals, that Donald Trump isn't really one of us. Sometimes he's vulgar. Sometimes he says things that are uncomfortable for us as Christians and we just don't know because he's not sitting in the front row of church every Sunday. What do you say to those folks?DR. ROBERT JEFFRESS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: First of all, Donald Trump is a friend of mine, and I'm very supportive of him for president. But Mike, this election is about religious liberty, and Hillary Clinton is no more capable of protecting religious liberty than she is protecting her e-mail servers.I mean, look at what she has said in the past. She's said at the Women of the World conference for women to have unfettered access to abortion, quote, ""that deeply seated religious beliefs of many will need to be changed."" She continues to demonize conservative Christians like us for believing in traditional marriage and believed that confused men shouldn't wander into women's bathroom.You compare that to Donald Trump who has said he will appoint conservative justices to the Supreme Court, justices who will not create imaginary constitutional rights for some but protect the real constitutional rights of all people.And governor, I want to say this as clearly as I can. Any conservative Christian who stays at home in November and allows Hillary Clinton to become the next president has forever forfeited his or her right to speak out about the sanctity of life, the sanctity of marriage, or religious freedom.HUCKABEE: I would say that is pretty clear, Dr. Jeffers. I appreciate the candor. David Lane, the events you've conducted over the country, not just this time but in every election cycle, not just presidential, for at least over 20 years, have been to mobilize the pastors to just get their people to try to vote. You don't tell how to vote. You don't even try to tell their pastors that they ought to tell their people how to vote, but to vote both their conscience and vote the Bible. Why is that important? What is it about the evangelicals that if they don't vote, something doesn't happen right?LANE: Somebody's values are going to reign supreme. Our values, or if our people stay home, as Dr. Jeffers said, then the other people putting their elected officials in are obviously going to impose their will, their agenda. That's the reason that evangelical Christians who didn't show up in 12 and didn't who up in 08, evangelical Christians and prolife Catholic Christians are going to have to engage the culture and vote.Politicians are not going to save America. Wall Street is not going to save America. From a Christian perspective, if America is going to be saved, it will be men and women who know the times and know what to do, who bringing our values to the public square, American exceptionalism, which is somebody's character. And virtue is a key component of freedom. So pastors and pews have to get engaged if we're going to turn the country.HUCKABEE: David, I wish I could keep going. I would love to keep you guys on all night, and I would if I could, but I've got to go.More of this special edition of ""Hannity: Road to the White House"" right after this, so stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HUCKABEE: Welcome back to this special edition of ""Hannity.""

"DISCLAIMER: THE FOLLOWING ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" CONTAINS STRONG OPINIONS WHICH ARE NOT A REFLECTION OF THE OPINIONS OF FOX NEWS AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AS INVESTMENT ADVICE WHEN MAKING PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS. IT IS FOX NEWS' POLICY THAT CONTRIBUTORS DISCLOSE POSITIONS THEY HOLD IN STOCKS THEY DISCUSS, THOUGH POSITIONS MAY CHANGE. READERS OF ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.DOES DONALD TRUMP NEED TO SPEND MORE OF HIS MONEY TO WIN?Michelle Fields: Well we know that the other strategy, which was what he was doing, wasn't working. He can't just draw great crowds and expect that these people are going to go out and vote. He needs to have a ground game. People in New Hampshire and Iowa they don't want to meet the candidate at a huge event, where they have to stand in line for hours in the cold to talk to the candidate. They want to talk to the candidate in their diner, in their local library, their local breakfast shop. That's what he needs to be doing, retail politics.Juan Williams: Well that's true. But let's remember, that Donald Trump got a tremendous number of votes in Iowa. He lost, but he did very well in terms of getting votes, but I do think the big difference here is spending money. So, Eric, the answer to your question is yes. It will make a difference. You know the question that all the pollsters ask, will the Trumpateers actually show up at the polls. Some people thought after Iowa, that was a problem. I know the crew's people told me they did not see the Donald's ground game in Iowa. I expect to see it in New Hampshire.Jonathan Hoenig: Spending has nothing to do with it, Eric. The money is irrelevant when it comes to winning elections. And Jeb Bush as Trump always talks about, proves that. I mean, Jeb Bush has spent a tremendous amount of money. If spending money worked then you know Hillary would be trouncing Sanders and Jeb Bush would be running away with it. People don't vote. Voters are not like Pavlov's dog, they don't respond to a token put into their socket to go out and vote. They vote based on morality, they vote based on ideals and the vetting process of these primaries has steered the attention away from Cruz and towards Trump.Jessica Tarlov: I think what Donald Trump really has going for him is that he's actually quite likable in small groups. He has a charming personality. I think that's part of why he gets a lot accomplished also in business. I think smaller crowds will definitely benefit him. I think spending more; I don't think it can ever be a mistake as long as you're not perceived as trying to buy an election, which he's not. He's not using a super Pac, he and Bernie Sanders both aren't doing that. So I think that yes, if he's spending more of his money, he's showing I'm investing in this because I believe in my message and I believe in you that it will benefit him. I don't know. I think Marco Rubio is the one on the rise here personally, but I don't think he can be hurt by spending.NEW DEBATE OVER SOCIALISM AS SANDERS GAINS MORE YOUNG SUPPORTERSJonathan Hoenig: Well, young people are idealistic. They believe in morality, they believe in issues, they believe in consistency. And, that is Bernie Sanders.Jessica Tarlov: It's when the economy is organized around the needs of the people and that's what comes first. That's what it is. That's what everyone should have said. That's what Debbie Wasserman Shultz should have said. That's what everyone should know. And that's why you should know that Bernie Sanders is not the right candidate on the Democratic side. This is not what's going to work, America runs because of capitalism. We need a healthy social safety net, of course, and that's what Hillary Clinton is talking about. But the younger voters, I was very disconcerted to see that between 30, going up to 50 percent of some of these groups are saying socialism is the way that we should be running our country. Calls for a complete overhaul of what makes America great and I don't really understand it. I talked to a lot of people about it and they don't seem understand that if you raise the minimum wage to $15, and I'm for raising it to $12. We know that 10, 10 would be safe.Michelle Fields: Eric, we're doomed. I went to the Bernie Sanders event in Iowa and it's filled with tons of people my age. They don't understand what socialism is. They just hear free college, free this; free that and they jump on board. And, the reason why is because they have professors who are telling them that socialism is good. They've been indoctrinated to believe that. They don't even understand it.Juan Williams: Well that's the thing. I was so interested to listen to Jonathan talk about idealism. I thought Jonathan was very supportive of these young people. And I got to tell you Jonathan, those young people do not like a broker like you. They think that guys like you on Wall Street. Well I always think of you as a broker because of your stock tips.PRESIDENT ASKING FOR $1.1B TO HELP FIGHT HEROIN AND OPIOID ADDICTIONJuan Williams: Well, not if you call it the war on drugs. As we remembered from the Reagan years or even from higher mandatory sentencing, this is what you call more attention to counseling and rehabilitation and if that's answer, yes. We need to put more money into saving human being, getting places, not just New Hampshire; this is something that is nationwide. I'll tell you something that strikes me about it, when it was a black and Hispanic problem, you didn't see this kind of outpouring from the politicians.Jonathan Hoenig: Eric, as you said a trillion plus since Nixon, under Bush, under all presidents, has perpetrated this continuing war on drugs. It's not only been a cost in the pocketbook, but how many lives have we ruined by, to Juan's point, mandatory incarceration and of all the things Obama could have done, forget Gitmo, forget socialized health care, why couldn't he have just pushed us towards drug decriminalization.Michelle Fields: Look, I agree that we need to improve our treatment centers but we also need to stop the flow and access of these drugs, which is why we need to secure our border, which no one seems to be talking about.Jessica Tarlov: These prescriptions aren't coming from Mexican doctors; I mean they're coming from American doctors who are overprescribing. I think, listen, this is one of the places where we have bipartisan agreement. Let's go with it. That rarely happens, I'm all for it."	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Rubio', 'Cruz', 'Obama']	[]

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle along with Geraldo Rivera, Eric Bolling, Meghan McCain and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.The fallout intensifies after the bombshell report on altered intelligence regarding ISIS which says top Pentagon officials may have been cooking the book to make it seem as if the terror group was less of a threat. Some now warn that the scandal could tarnish the president's legacy. Stephen Hayes of ""The Weekly Standard"" explains the gravity of the stunning news.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEPHEN F. HAYES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think this is the single biggest scandal of the Obama administration. And when the history books are written about this in 20 years or 30 years or 40 years and we see these declassified files and we learn what was in the Osama bin Laden document cash, people will be appalled at what was withheld from intelligence analyst, the way that the book were cook and what the American people didn't know as they had to make important decisions about the future of the country.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Earlier on Fox, former CIA Director James Woolsey slammed those who skewed the intelligence on ISIS.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAMES WOOLSEY, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: If you are in the intelligence businesses and you're cooking the results in order to make your boss are happy or to respond to some nuance to come from some superior, you're worse than worthless. You are helping move the government in a direction that is in tune with, as they put it, the narrative and making the facts fit the narrative, rather than trying to understand the facts and help the government devise a policy to deal with the real factual situation.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: OK, Greg, fallout from this and what do you think of James Woolsey comments?GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Well, James, he's a great guy. But I got to back -- can I go back to Hayes?GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: He said history books will be written about this. No, because this is an issue that angers conservatives and not liberals. If this were a conservative government, then history books will write about this. And not only that, Hollywood will make movies about this. Whenever there is corruption, Michael Clayton was about pharmaceuticals, China syndrome was about nuclear power, Erin Brockovich was about the corruption of corporations, but this is, you know, this is President Obama. He is the leader. There' been -- this will not be written about, there will be an eternal moratorium on critical -- on critical histories and films about any kind of scandal. I wish that people would take this seriously, but unfortunately it happened under a different president.GUILFOYLE: Interesting. All right, Bolling, so what do you think of the fallout for this?ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: I think this is amazing.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: I mean the Department of Defense inspector general says, this is just the initial report, there's a lot more to come. They were -- there's an attempt to distort and suppress the intelligence.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: Distort and suppress the intelligence. I mean, the reason why that matters is because, if that's the case, that means assets weren't delivered to the places .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: . they needed to be in time, maybe to save people's lives. Save Americans lives.GUILFOYLE: Talked about that yesterday.BOLLING: I mean this is insane. It goes on to say that the facts on the ground didn't match what the, what the CENTCOM was saying. I mean -- so, OK, so that's the Department of Defense. This -- they make the recommendations to the White House and then White House says, ""OK, go ahead, move that there, don't move that there. We don't need that, we don't"" -- and again, Libya, Benghazi, looks like it's not safe. Chris Stevens has been asking for more support for months now, for months now. No, it doesn't look -- our reports say, ""No, everything's OK there. There's no risk of terror activity taking down the consulate."" And what happens? I don't know. Look, I think there's a lot more than this in the beginning.GUILFOYLE: OK, part B. Is this something that Trump can capitalize? And like Greg is bringing up .(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: . is it the wrong, you know, president that associated with this, meaning it stings and sticks with Obama. Does it translate at all to Hillary Clinton?BOLLING: We'll see what the fallout was. When did they say things were better than they were? Why did anyone die within the places they said things were better than they were?GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I agree with that second part. That's why I'm curious you brought up Benghazi, Libya, when you didn't even know whether that was fallout --BOLLING: Well, I don't know if it is or not, but if there's a culture of doing that and .GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: . and under Hillary Clinton's tenure there.GUILFOYLE: It raises more questions.RIVERA: Was it --BOLLING: Of course.RIVERA: Was it the defense department .MEGHAN MCCAIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It wasn't anything.GUILFOYLE: Meghan.RIVERA: . or was it the White House? I mean, you don't know. There is --BOLLING: There's no tied to the White House.GUILFOYLE: Meghan.RIVERA: There's certainly tension between the Obama administration and the --GUILFOYLE: Yeah.MCCAIN: But this is the hypocrisy of the left right now. If these were republican administration and this had come up, ""The New York Times"" would be screaming bloody murder. This is on A-6 today, it should on A-1.GUILFOYLE: Good point.MCCAIN: If you were saying, Eric, people hypothetically could have been -- could have died. He's been saying it's the JV team, ISIS is contained. We had five terrorist attacks last month. Anyone with two brain cells knows that ISIS is growing. And the fact that they were trying to change information in order to protect his legacy is egregious. And this is what they accused Bush of doing for such a long time. And this is the hypocrisy of the liberal left and the liberal media that we talked about all the time. People would be screaming bloody murderer if Dick Cheney were involved.GUILFOYLE: You know -- and Meghan, just want to follow up with you coming from a family that has a history, a legacy of dedicated military service still serving, you know, as we speak .MCCAIN: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: . you know family members. What do you think, you know touching on what Bolling mentioned about committing assets, having real time accurate intelligence that we can make sure that those that we send abroad and into this theater are adequately protected and have the right resources?MCCAIN: Listen, this is -- I mean, unfortunately, this is very personal, my brother was in Iraq. And then I think for a lot of people when President Obama decided to pull out immediately and then obviously, ISIS metastasized and turned into the evil that is spread globally today, a lot of the efforts and work of so many great men and women in the military. I know they feel because I've talked to many of them that it was for not and this is the failed leadership. And I actually do agree with Stephen Hayes that of all the things President Obama has done, this will be the legacy and there is blood on his and the administration's hands right now.GUTFELD: I disagree. I think the legacy will be President Obama's summer music list. Did you see it?MCCAIN: Oh, I know.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Did you see it? It was released. There was a collection of pop music, hip-hop and rhythm and blues. And so, it's nice to know how cool our president is.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: I'm sure those families that are fleeing war torn cities and watching journalists get beheaded go, at least President Obama, he likes the best music.(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: I would like Stephen Hayes to suggest to us what the source of this information is and why he believes that it is so definitive, that is the largest of all scandals within the Obama administration. I would submit that pulling out of the Iraq in 2011 .GUTFELD: Yeah.RIVERA: . I was on the last combat.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. You're a work correspondent. You've been imbed as well.RIVERA: Correct. And there is always has regime the White House and United States military look at Afghanistan. President Obama wanted to draw down Afghanistan down to .MCCAIN: Yeah.RIVERA: ... nearly nothing. And it was the military who objected, the military dug in their heels and they kept the forces in Afghanistan and at least very minimal --MCCAIN: But they're not using them.RIVERA: Minimally --MCCAIN: The troops support they need. I mean, he's sending 8500 and they asked for 20.RIVERA: That is the different issue. But I want to point put one political aspect.MCCAIN: The issue -- no, no. It's --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Yes, hold it up.MCCAIN: Interjected, it's not a different issue because if you're cooking the books and saying that ISIS is contained, they're not as a big of a threat, then the military thinks we don't need it --RIVERA: But that is a big if --(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: That is a big if, Meghan. You say .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.MCCAIN: It's not a big if.RIVERA: . if they are cooking the books.MCCAIN: It's not a big if.BOLLING: Well, hold it. Hold it.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Right here, right here (inaudible).RIVERA: It is a task force of the House republicans.MCCAIN: It is not a big if.RIVERA: I don't believe anything a task force .MCCAIN: But it's obvious in the language.RIVERA: . of the House republicans or the House democrats.BOLLING: So do ever believe the inspector --RIVERA: Tell me.BOLLING: The inspector general?RIVERA: No. I'm being --I believe the inspector general.BOLLING: OK. General just said there's more to come.RIVERA: The inspector general is just beginning .BOLLING: Right.RIVERA: . his probing.BOLLING: Right.MCCAIN: President Obama has never taking --RIVERA: He has not made any pointing --MCCAIN: He's never taking care of it seriously --RIVERA: This is all you're, all you're repeating now is what the hell is republican --MCCAIN: No, it's why -- it's why Islamic extremism has continued to spread. Ask people -- ask the five terror attacks that happened last month with Islamic extremism. They said it was the JV team, they said it was contained many, many leaders across this country and CIA operatives that it's not working, it's getting more extreme. He didn't listen and now, he's cooking the books to protect his legacy. It's egregious.GUTFELD: There's one thing that Geraldo --RIVERA: To say he's cooking the books is to come .MCCAIN: This is --RIVERA: . to a conclusion, a conclusion based on a political task force opposed to the administration, a republican house task force that hates the Obama administration.MCCAIN: That is such --RIVERA: I don't trust them .MCCAIN: That is such an irresponsible --RIVERA: And I don't trust the democrats either.MCCAIN: That is such an irresponsible statement.RIVERA: How so?MCCAIN: That is such an irresponsible statement.RIVERA: Why do they have a bipartisan investigation?MCCAIN: Because they're getting worse.RIVERA: Why not? If this is --MCCAIN: Because there were five terrorist attacks last month.BOLLING: Hold on --RIVERA: If we care about patriotism, why not have a house .MCCAIN: That's so --BOLLING: Can we --RIVERA: . democrats and republicans (inaudible).BOLLING: Can we agree on one thing?MCCAIN: It is highly irresponsible.GUTFELD: Can we sing Kumbaya for five seconds here?BOLLING: Can we just agree on one thing?GUILFOYLE: We're out of time.BOLLING: That I think you may be right. Yes, OK, so right now it's house republicans.RIVERA: RightBOLLING: However, the inspector general is that body your --RIVERA: I agree.GUILFOYLE: It's the independent body that you're talking about, yeah.BOLLING: And if that this independent body does come back and says, yup --(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: Then you can use definitive language .BOLLING: And we can go.RIVERA: . in saying, who cook the book?MCCAIN: But what about the JV team where contained?RIVERA: I agree.MCCAIN: It's the language .RIVERA: I agree.MCCAIN: . out of our own president now.RIVERA: That goes back to my point.MCCAIN: It's not just these reports. It's the language and the climate of the administration for the past seven and a half years, and it's why ISIS is growing.GUILFOYLE: Correct.GUTFELD: The interesting thing. There's a common thread to what Geraldo and Meghan are talking about. You're talking about the pull out of Iraq which was a mistake. We're talking about cooking the books. They both have to do with the danger of ego. President Obama's ego prevented him from admitting that those troops should stay because that was a decision not made by himself.RIVERA: And he hated that war.GUTFELD: And he hated that war, but he couldn't believe that it was actually working, that the surge was working.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: He couldn't admit he was wrong. In this case of the books, the people that are working beneath him also realized this is a personal, a personal thing for him. This is his ego. He needs to know that he was right about ISIS. These two things have one thing in common. It is the fact that President Obama is so insecure about being seen as fallible, when in fact it would be helpful for him to admit once in awhile he's wrong, because when you admit you're wrong, you save lives.MCCAIN: And the left-wing media just wanted to bury it.GUILFOYLE: Good point.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Can I give you one more alternative here.GUTFELD: Right.GUILFOYLE: Go ahead.BOLLING: So if the department -- the CENTCOM, the Defense Department knows that President Obama wants that narrative, knows that .GUILFOYLE: True.BOLLING: . they'll be treated better, they'll be looked higher ups, more esteem if they come back with the report saying, ""Hey, guess what, boss? Everything you're looking for, that's happening. We're kicking ISIS's butt.""RIVERA: I think that that is a plausible scenario.MCCAIN: Who's going to say that?RIVERA: And I also submit that it exists in every administration. But I do think that what you suggest .MCCAIN: No one is going to say that.RIVERA: . is more plausible to me than they were --BOLLING: Still as dangerous stuff.MCCAIN: But no one's going to say that. There were five attacks. One is chronicle.GUILFOYLE: Right.MCCAIN: Nobody's going to say that. No one is like, yeah, we got ISIS -- contained. It's great. Everything is going great, five attacks last month.GUILFOYLE: Because all the facts point to the contrary. So there isn't -- then you like, you know fact-pattern to support the false narrative that the president, the administration has put forth, let alone the suppressing, Eric, and distortion of the information was CENTCOM.BOLLING: I will tell you that .GUILFOYLE: Very problematic.BOLLING: . people will -- in order to achieve approval of your higher ups, will kind of make things look better like you're winning, like you're making things a lot better.RIVERA: In a lot of businesses.BOLLING: I don't disagree with that. I will disagree I think that, that maybe the case. There's no tied to the White House yet.MCCAIN: I -- well, I think --BOLLING: It is not yet.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: This is not like -- it's not like we're placing top shelf booze at a bar with well drinks.GUILFOYLE: Oh.GUTFELD: You know what I mean? Difference if price.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. That happens.GUTFELD: It actually -- we fabricate Intel, you're actually creating a toxic recipe, but it does shows you how corrupted language has become and how we're constantly trying to reconfigure how to say what evil is. For example, we keep talking about this, how the surge worked. In the old days, war was a constant surge. The reason why .MCCAIN: Yeah.GUTFELD: . a surge is valuable is because we aren't surging all the time, so we end up in a consistent state of non-war, when in fact, we should be obliterating, and obliterating is a constant surge.RIVERA: And to me, that is the biggest scandal of the Obama administration, that they allowed ISIS to use Meghan's word to metastasize and allowed them to have geographic territory, to have a country, de facto country to perpetrate the most savage atrocities and only gradually escalated the effort against him. I think that's the --MCCAIN: When I can agree on that --GUTFELD: I disagree with both of you.GUILFOYLE: Just do it. All right. You can tell this is a hot one. Alrighty, all right?BOLLING: I don't mind the peacekeeper for one second.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: I don't know Bolling. What happened?RIVERA: I was very impressed, though.GUILFOYLE: OK, everybody. Later this hour, we'll be taking your questions on this Facebook Friday. So please go to our page and post them now, facebook.com/thefivefnc. Up next, the mainstream media's jumping all over Trump for calling President Obama an ISIS founder, but remember when they had no problem with Hillary calling Trump an ISIS recruiter? Next, when we return.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Donald Trump has been under fire by mainstream media for calling President Obama an ISIS founder, yet why wasn't the same standard applied to Hillary Clinton when she trashed Trump as an is recruiter? Here's a flashback.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: He has becoming ISIS' best recruiter. They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.I think it was said just this week that the way Donald Trump talks about terrorism and his, you know, very insulting language toward Muslims is making him the recruiting sergeant for ISIS.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: This morning, Trump walked back his ISIS remark, tweeting, he was only being sarcastic, but at the rally this afternoon, he said he was only being that sarcastic. Trump ally, Newt Gingrich offers his advice for the GOP nominee in line with this controversy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: One of the things is frustrating about his candidacy is the imprecise language. He sometimes uses three words when he needs 10. And I think if he said in that sense, but clearly, the conditions for ISIS were created by a series of decisions that Obama and Clinton made. He'd be a hundred percent accurate. It would be very understandable. And when you instead compress them into Obama created ISIS, I know what Trump has in his mind, but that's not what people hear.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right, KG.GUILFOYLE: I think there's an explanation.BOLLING: So he says like this founder --GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: He says ISIS recruiter at the end of -- I mean, what's the difference?GUILFOYLE: Oh well, it's just a double standard. And Newt pointed out there, because this is specifically about what world economy is like, Trump is trying to do it in three instead of 10. It's a mind of a businessman, he's always looking to like, nail it down, get it done, say what he's saying. He knows what he's thinking, but it's about now being very careful to choose your words to make sure that they don't misconstrue it. What you've seen is a concerted effort, really. It's like the most like unholy partnership of all time between the Obama administrations, Hillary Clinton, (inaudible) making comments, trying to bait Trump into saying something that will side track him. And then the mainstream media, refusing to cover the same things when Hillary says it, as it very -- which is very difficult to catch, given the fact that it was like, what, 240 plus days before she did a press conference to answer a question. They're protecting her to make sure that they're safe. They're in a safe space for HRC and then Trump is out there answering questions every day. If you think about the amount of press conferences, interviews, statements and everything that he's done, relative to the number of times, people will say, well, this is a questionable or problematic moment. It's really, his body habits isn't just so bad.BOLLING: Geraldo, founder, recruiter, a difference with distinction or no?RIVERA: Woe is us, the world is unfair, Eric. I think that that is absolutely irrelevant. What is relevant is that Donald Trump allowed the media, gave them enough ammo that they could, you know, exacerbate his self-inflicted wound this week. He made a great speech about the economy that you will load on Monday.(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: Tuesday, he should have come back with the more on that. Wednesday, Thursday -- it should have been his week of the economy. Instead, what he's talking about? He's talking about President Obama is the founder of ISIS? Come on. Grow up already. That's absolutely a distraction that hurts his campaign. He's losing time. He's burning. It's now less than 90 days. He can't afford to waste a week saying he's founder, and he gets cute this afternoon. Well, it's being sarcastic, maybe not that sarcastic. I think that, you know, this is, this is very wild and erratic and undisciplined candidate.BOLLING: No doubt. But Meghan, I didn't see this constant drumbeat of .MCCAIN: Yeah.BOLLING: . Hillary Clinton called Donald Trump an ISIS recruiter.MCCAIN: Yeah.BOLLING: On and on and on. Again, the way we see this sound bite that, even we played too many times.MCCAIN: Can I say something? When Donald Trump says things, it offends people sometimes and it can be controversial, but when Hillary makes mistakes, people die. And I'm going to give an example. This Iranian scientist, Shahram Amiri, who was an informant for the CIA and a spy for us, with the Iranian nuclear program, he was killed by the mullahs.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.MCCAIN: And his name was released in Hillary Clinton's e-mails, they caught the -- e-mails that had already yoga and Chelsea's wedding in it. And then he was killed. So why are we talking this? Talking about the fact the she put our national security at risk. So you want to talk about who is in- charge of ISIS? I actually agree with Donald Trump, and this is one of the least controversial things he's ever said according to me, because like I said earlier, I think there's blood on Obama's hands for pulling us out of Iraq, and the damage that's been done with ISIS. But it's just -- it's so egregious. This is real life information about our CIA .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.MCCAIN: . informants being murdered and it's getting no coverage except on this channel.BOLLING: All right Greg, you need advice here?GUTFELD: Absolutely not. I make my bread and butter complaining and whining about media bias, but the benefit of media bias for the last year has been in Trump's camp. He's gotten four to five times the coverage of everybody. Why, because he says shocking things. So if you live by the sword, you die by the sword. He got all the press because he says, outlanders see things. So he can't whine about it. He even knows it. And when he says he's sarcastic, he's lying to all of us and we all know that he's lying. However, I have to defend him on one very key point, what he's doing is he's stealing the liberal playbook for the longest time. The liberal playbook has been about making your adversary a threat. You are a threat to the planet in you are republican. You are a threat to the constitution .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: . if you're a conservative. You're a threat to the universe if you don't believe in science, if you're like a, you know, a religious zealot.MCCAIN: (inaudible) you're pro-life.GUTFELD: Yes. So he is now just playing their game. They say he's a threat to the planet, he says well they, you know, they invented ISIS. However, this isn't the worst thing he's said. By any (inaudible), the other, the other day he said --RIVERA: The Second Amendment.GUTFELD: No, no. In between that he said, ""You know if I lose, you know I go back, I got a pretty good life."" That would kind of piss me off as a supporter. It's like I don't want the guy who's running, talking about losing. That, to me, is offensive. He just -- there's a lot of people out there that are living and breathing for him and he's saying, ""You know, if it doesn't work out, I've got a pretty good life."" That's worst than this.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: He will put it on the line. Yeah.BOLLING: Can I just throw a little context on that for you. He was asked what you would do if you don't win.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: And he said, ""Well, you know I have a pretty a good life."" I can go back to. Meaning, I'm not going to be a politician --BOLLING: Not me in my --GUILFOYLE: There's a different ways.BOLLING: Meaning, I'm not to go to politics --GUILFOYLE: Different way to answer that, because they cut it.BOLLING: You think the outside of it.GUILFOYLE: The problem is they cut the bite.GUTFELD: Yes, the point is --GUILFOYLE: . they cut the bite.GUTFELD: You're turning into a new spoiled child.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: He can rely on you guys to explain. Isn't it exhausting?BOLLING: No, no.(CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: He never did to rely on me, never one.(CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: I will say though, but as the news stream I'm talking about with this Iranian scientist and Hillary, (inaudible), you're talking about a double standard in military -- in the media .GUTFELD: Yeah.MCCAIN: . and there really is one. That being said, he doesn't need to give him anymore ammo. He could be a lot more disciplined.GUILFOYLE: Just speak tricky -- yeah.MCCAIN: Eighty-seven more days. That's it.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: You know what it reminds me of, a ping-pong player that continues to return a bad serve. If you just let Hillary make the mistake .BOLLING: All right, good point.GUTFELD: . you're up 1-0.GUILFOYLE: Are you good at ping-pong?GUTFELD: I love ping-pong.(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: Although I appreciate your -- his defeat statement in your interpretation. When you think back to the Second Amendment, he didn't --MCCAIN: Yeah.RIVERA: He didn't mean, literally that you wanted gun people to go assassinate Hillary Clinton, and it was several days at least, a distraction on the news cycle. Then you've got this latest gaffe in (inaudible), Obama is the founder of ISIS.MCCAIN: No.RIVERA: I mean he really has to grow up. And he has to use the same discipline he uses to build buildings, he -- and to be so successful, where is that acumen? Where is that sophistication?BOLLING: We'll leave it there. Think about it in the break. Directly ahead, it's another example of Clinton corruption. The Clinton's foundation pay for play scandal, so just how deep does this go and where will it end if it's ever does? We examine that, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MCCAIN: Just how deep the corruption run, stunning new developments in Hillary's e-mail scandal. According to reports, longtime Clinton aide, Cheryl Mills, held job interviews for the Clinton Foundation while working as a senior official at the State Department. The Clinton campaign insists there was no conflict of interest. Syndicated Columnist Charles Krauthammer, slam the shady connections.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: It was dealing getting favors for the people who were contributing to it from the State Department. Now that is so obviously, it may not be illegal that you may not be able to prove a quid pro quo, but this sort of use of the foundation and then working with the State Department, whether it was Hillary, personally or not, does not matter. To get favors is a form of corruption, at the least.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCCAIN: Kimberly, how egregious .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.MCCAIN: . do you think this is?GUILFOYLE: Well, I mean, it's egregious from the outset, right? It's a refusal despite a request to do an investigation. It's like shutdown automatically when you look back at the history of this and the relationships that have been forged over the years, right, which the Clintons are specialist at. Loretta Lynch appointed by Bill Clinton, fast- forward, now appointed by President Obama to replace Eric Holder; fast- forward to the plane, fast-forward to the bizarre, you know, Comey press conference where he laid out and made the case against Hillary Clinton, and then said, ""Up,"" but no charges. I mean, the whole thing, it's just smacks of just corruption, of, you know, quid pro quo of helping one another and, you know, with the Clinton's being Teflon no matter what or how egregious they are. But this, I think is very important because we've been talking about the two aspects that we always said, and even Juan Williams has said, the ""pay for play"".RIVERA: Even Juan Williams.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, he even -- he agreed with us. Let's see if you do, Gerardo, that this is really greedy to the ""pay for play"" with the Clinton Global Initiative and why aren't they investigating this.MEGHAN MCCAIN, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Are you as offended by this?GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Well, I was involved in drugs for octopus. It was quid quo pro.MCCAIN: Oh my god.GUTFELD: Cheryl Mills works at the State Department ...RIVERA: She can't take that up, yes.GUTFELD: Yeah. I was just thinking about it. OK. It could be just like -- you know what? It's like -- so, Hillary, Hillary used ...MCCAIN: Like a boy, she's just like recovering now.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Hillary used Cheryl Mills ...MCCAIN: She can't take it.GUTFELD: Cheryl Mill works at the State Department and then uses her to basically do kind of personal work ...MCCCAIN: All right.GUTFELD: ... for the Clinton Foundation. That's like me stopping Fox Contributor, Dr. Marc Siegel, in the hallway and asking him to look at the mole. It's like it's -- and so you're mixing the political with the professional which is its not good. But it's wit. This is not -- this is supposed to be about a foundation, but it's like a fund-raiser for the Bill and Hillary charity fund. You know, when you see those commercials for poor kids in Third World countries except its Bill and Hillary trying to get funds for their third house in the Hampton.GUILFOYLE: Right.MCC: Yes, I mean ...GUILFOYLE: It's in cuff (ph).RIVERA: Your best example that Dr. Siegel looking at people's moles, I think Dr. Siegel looks at quite a few people's moles in this building.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, don't act like you haven't been in his office.GUTFELD: I made a couple of call ...RIVERA: I find no evidence that there's a joint FBI-DOJ investigation into the Clinton Foundation. There may be, but nobody I know knows about it.MCCAIN: Can I just ask you really quick? Do you think it was weird that Cheryl Mills was interviewing someone with the Clinton Foundation forward to work there while she works at the State Department? Do you think that's a conflict of interest?RIVERA: I -- let me answer more broadly, Meghan, that I do believe that the Clinton Foundation in all its labyrinth and its size there was critical of earlier this week, its various tentacles and ties to other non-for- profit, I think that it is rich territory fertile ground for investigation and probing. I think a fair person would say, ""They have to be absolutely transparent to that.""Now, in terms of someone who is their dear friend from here or there doing this or that, I don't know quite how that works. I'm not -- to me, there has not been any evidence that there's any quid pro quo, that there's any, ""You do this for me, so you scratch my back off ...ERIC BOLLING, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Except for those e-mails.(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: Yes, but I haven't ...BOLLING: So for those e-mails ...(CROSSTALK)GUIFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: So for the e-mails, where ...RIVERA: Those e-mails ...BOLLING: ... the guy says, ""I need access to that Lebanese guy in here ...RIVERA: No, no, that's not ...BOLLING: ... but don't worry, we -- this guy drops a lot of money into the Clinton Foundation.RIVERA: That's not what the e-mail said. Of course it did.BOLLING: This guy wants an introduction to the ambassador to Lebanon.RIVERA: Yes. The ambassador to Lebanon is a public official. There's nothing illegal there.BOLLING: Except for the part wherein this guy ...GUILFOYLE: Drops cash, yeah.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: ... drops cash.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Did you -- have you been in Washington lately and do you think that this is intended?RIVERA: You know, listen, that doesn't looks like nothing.BOLLING: It's okay if it happens a lot. It still means that the president wants ...(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: But let me know what ...RIVERA: Everyday, all day, in proper (ph) agency.BOLLING: The Clintons have no problem doing this, and they've never had a problem doing it.GUILFOYLE: They're really good at doing it, they're varsity, yeah.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: ... are coming home for roast (ph) right now.MCCAIN: Yeah.BOLLING: You know why Charls ...GUILFOYLE: Oh, you go, Jeremiah.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: ... that you can't prove quid pro quo because there's 33,000 e- mails on her server that she won't turnover or abandon. And not likely, those are the ones that tie -- that are the proof, the smoky gun between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department.MCCAIN: Assange, I know and that he promises not ...GUILFOYLE: October surprise.MCCAIN: ... to surprise his promises. Just so I'm saying that. All right. Stay right there because Facebook Friday is coming up next.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: Back for Facebook Friday, we're answering your questions. We're going to start around this, OK.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: That was dark shadows. All right. This is from Michael C. Meghan, if you could have excelled at an Olympic sport, which one would it be?MCCAIN: I was terrible at sports in my whole life, I don't know. I mean ...GUTFELD: There's got to be one thing.MCCAIN: Maybe swimming. I don't know. I like it, I don't know.GUTFELD: It doesn't even have to be that kind of sport.MCCAIN: But I wouldn't have to like be on a team, and just -- it'll just be me.(CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: Swimming. Yeah, swimming. What about you?GUTFELD: Well, I'm going to go around this way.MCCAIN: Oh, sorry. Eric, what about you?BOLLING: My turn?GUILFOYLE: Yeah.MCCAIN: Yeah.GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: I would -- it's no longer Olympic sport, baseball. How can you be -- how do you take baseball?RIVERA: They took out women's softball because our women were always winning.MCCAIN: Yeah, that was even mine too.BOLLING: I think that's what I find it. I would place with boxing or basketball.GUTFELD: Gerardo?RIVERA: Definitely, boxing.MCCAIN: Boxing.RIVERA: It's in my blood. My brother was Golden Gloves. I fought for 25 years. I dreamt of that.BOLLING: Is that why we keep having this?GUILFOYLE: Yes.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: He's on Fantasy Island with Bolling.BOLLING: I think he get a couple of ...(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: All you need is Mr. Roarke recreate the moment.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: I would've been, you know, soft like made your (inaudible) softball, but I would definitely say gymnastics. I used to be a gymnast like Dana Perino.GUTFELD: Oh, yes.GUILFOYLE: I still consider myself somewhat of a gymnast.GUTFELD: What do you mean? Anyway, you know what I would pick? I would pick the shot put, because I have an unusually strong right arm.GUILFOYLE: It's not real, OK.GUTFELD: Yeah, a little bit of that. Someone will remember that five years from now.GUILFOYLE: Shot put.GUTFELD: And my left.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Anyway, this is from Paul K., we'll go this way. Kimberly, what subject would you rather be discussing than politics?RIVERA: That's a good one.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, than politics? Well, I mean, 100 percent national security, foreign policy. That's one of my favorite things to discuss.GUTFELD: That's kind of in there, so, that's a cop out, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: I know, it can be, it can be.GUTFELD: That's cop out, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: It too can interest the fact. Well, then, the law, does that make you happy?GUTFELD: Cop out, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Oh, he does not call me that.GUTFELD: Gerardo?RIVERA: I think right now ...GUILFOYLE: Hold the Special K?RIVERA: ... and we will be discussing in the next segment, Special K. I love sports, and the Olympics is the epitome of sports and I just love talking it out and later on, in a couple of minutes we would've been talking about it here. But I think sports. And also, you talked about children a lot. When you have five kids, you talk about how you doing, how doing, how you doing.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.MCCAIN: Yeah.RIVERA: They get that job, they get this, you know, you talk about your kids a lot.BOLLING: God, sports, also. I mean, it's great. And this Olympics has done amazing. I'm suck, I didn't think it was going to be that good because with all the problems that Rio is having.RIVERA: Yes.BOLLING: Oh, boy, it's been pretty amazing. By the way, seeing that American flag up top of the medal count, it's awesome.GUTFELD: That's our next segment.BOLLING: Sorry.GUTFELD: I know, they just said to me in my ear. Meghan, and you're -- since you're in the Jasper chair, we won't have to say dog's.MCCAIN: This is Jasper chair. Oh, I don't have a dog. Is this that sacrilege to be in this chair?GUTFELD: Yes, you have to leave.MCCAIN: Sorry. What will I say -- well, I guess pop culture. I mean, I like to watch bad reality shows and all that stuff, I guess.GUTFELD: Oh, Eric, that's serious.MCCAIN: I guess that would be a ...(CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: Well, it's a good ice breaker for like a universal conversation.GUTFELD: Yes, you can take about it on the bus, the bus you take every day with the regular people.MCCAIN: The bus?GUTFELD: Yes.MCCAIN: I take the subway.GUTFELD: I take the subway. I take your train, but, you know, I would -- I wrote out artificial intelligence at parallel universities (ph).(CROSSTALK)MCCAIN: Oh, my gosh, it's robust.GUTFELD: No, no, no, you -- we're all going to have to deal with this. With combination, artificial intelligence and ...(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: When we die, we will immediately be reborn as somebody else, but it will be the death of the self.BOLLING: We need to describe -- we have to do segments on autopilot on cars.GUTFELD: Yeah, yeah, yeah.BOLLING: I mean this is really blowing up.GUTFELD: Whatever -- you know what? And also, do you know why, because a car is going to make moral decision. When a family is in a car ...GUILFOYLE: Yes.RIVERA: Yes.GUTFELD: ... and a dog runs out, the car has to decide, hit the dog or go off the cliff and kill the family. You have to be -- that a car is going to make that decision.GUILFOYLE: Wow.RIVERA: You have to be a stoner to talk about that.GUTFELD: There was -- I don't have to be.GUILFOYLE: I think it depends from who the owner of the car is.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: ... the guy having pulmonary embolism, drove him to the hospital and he lives because of that.GUTFELD: That's amazing.GUILFOYLE: Wow, Greg, get on it. I want you to research this over the weekend.GUTFELD: This is a great line. I'll start with you Eric. From Jean D, do you find comments for viewer mostly supportive, helpful, entertaining or insulting? That will make what?BOLLING: All of them when you get the gamut.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: I'm really when you get the gamut. I used to answer the insulting ones, the mean ones ...GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: ... and it just got old.GUTFELD: No, no, no, because it creates the adrenaline of a fight.BOLLING: Yes.GUTFIELD: There is no fight but it makes you want to fight.BOLLING: It does. It's a herd mentally. They all come out, ""Oh, he's responding to that negative."" No, just accept and just let it go. I've never blocked more people that I haven't since this twice.GUTFELD: I even stopped doing that. Well, Gerardo, I think that ...MCCAIN: I didn't block anybody ever since.GUTFELD: I'm not to say that you're old of different generations. You didn't have to deal with that --RIVERA: I am older.GUTFELD: You, yes, but you know what? You don't have to deal with these sort of things.RIVERA: Right.GUTFELD: So, it kind of must be seemed alien that people care?RIVERA: Well, I started Twitter and Facebook late, deep into 2011, and I was shocked at the negative comments, and I was shocked at how insulting and ad hominem they were. You're this and this and you're, you know, your family is vast and -- I mean, just really horrible, horrible stuff.GUTFELD: They can't get to your face.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.RIVERA: And that's where I finally came to that conclusion that these are the people in the basement. These are the trolls that, you know, they can't get out of mama's shadow.GUTFELD: A lot of them were from Nida Horal (ph). And you've accurately portrayed me.RIVERA: I did block you but yes ...GUILFOYLE: When Greg goes on Twitter, watch out.GUTFELD: Yeah, you, you see a lot of images.GUILFOYLE: Yes, I'm I keep box securities, super full time busy and they launch investigations. It's pretty amazing like this picture you'll see does not actually that person's blah blah blah.MCCAIN: Oh, my gosh.GUILFOYLE: But they got it from the internet, like ""Thank you so much in crack investigation team.""But you know, I don't mind the, you know, the comments. To be honest, I don't block, so I'm like, ""Whatever, because they're going to say what they're going the say.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Just got to rise above it. So, I'm actually pretty good about that. I don't like to have a panic attack about the Twitter.GUTFELD: Meghan?MCCAIN: I'm with you. I mean, it's just all -- people love you, people hate you, but I think Kimberly can attest when you're a woman, and especially someone with high profile like Kimberly, like there're a lot of weirdoes. I mean, there are lots of people that tweet me about Kimberly, of course, when they know I'm coming on the show and I don't have access to Kimberly's personal life. So, I can't help you if you want to date her, just putting that out there.GUTFELD: Yeah, yeah, doing that ...(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: But you don't have to like one thing.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: ... except my cousins, except my brothers.GUTFELD: ... are people who's with you with information that means that they know you well enough that they can make a joke or they know something about you.MCCAIN: Right.GUTFELD: And I like that. And so you can tell that somebody is watching enough to understand you and they'll do a subtle thing to you that no one else does. But they get you. They understand either the music or the background ...(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: So pay so much attention.GUTFELD: Yes, I like that.GUILFOYLE: But Dana manages her Twitter the best, like she's really interactive and writing things back and forth.GUTFELD: All right.RIVERA: But now, who would say anything mean to Dana anyway?BOLLLING: People who don't like George Bush. Yeah.GUTFELD: Really?BOLLING: Yes.GUTFELD: What does she have to do with that? I mean ...MCCAIN: People think ...(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: No, I know that. But I mean, it's not her fault that ...MCCAIN: People think of Celine Dion.GUTFELD: I'm going to go now. All right. Up next, it's an incredible story of redemption, Michael Phelps winning his 22nd Olympic Gold Medal. More are on. It's amazing comeback when the five returns.MCCAIN: How was it to come back when he was ...GUTFELD: That was smooth. Well, it was awesome.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)RIVERA: Gold rush for Team USA last night. First, the much anticipated duel in the pool between two of America's greatest swimmers ever, Michael Phelps blowing away Ryan Lochte in the 200-meter medley winning gold and becoming the first Olympic swimmer to win an event for the fourth consecutive time, the fourth consecutive Olympics.Phelps struggled to hold back tears on the meddle stand, later saying his comeback has been a dream after enduring a downward spiral, we all know about, that included those DUI arrests in 2014.Another grand moment, Simone Manuel becoming the first African-American woman to win an individual event in swimming, and another Simone, you know her, she's so adorable from the U.S., making us all proud. Simone Biles winning a huge day for the women's gymnastics team, winning gold in the all around with a dominating performance that had many hailing her. She have - - right now, is the greatest gymnast of all time and I have to hasten, they had Laurie Hernandez, a Puerto Rican descendant, Kimberly doing so well ...GUILFOYLE: Yeah, our sister from another mother.RIVERA: A sister from another mother.GUILFOYLE: Puerto Ricans unite.RIVERA: Adorable 15-years old. I think she's the future of the sport.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, God bless her.RIVERA: So, do you love it, Kimberly?GUILFOYLE: Yeah, I love it. I think it's superexciting and, you know, I love watching the gymnastic division, the competition. I really, think you know, the superstars that we've got here on the U.S. team, it's really a historic moment. I think a lot more to come, right, in the years. And also, Michael Phelps, I'm very happy for him, for like pulling his life together and has a beautiful child.RIVERA: How about this kid? Unbelievable.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, she's unbelievable.RIVERA: And here he is.GUILFOYLE: There he is, in a moment of -- I mean 22. Wow.RIVERA: Greg, Eric mentioned how she feels kind of verklempt when he sees the U.S. on the meda ...GUTFELD: Yes.RIVERA: ... you know, on the podium and he sees the medal tally. You tend to be a little more cynical. Do you dismiss it as kind of vacuous patriotism?GUTFELD: Not at all, not at all. I don't watch the Olympics anymore and it's for a very depressing reason. Every time I watch the Summer Olympics, it reminds me that I'm four years older. And the interesting thing about it is because as you age and have more years behind you, the four years actually go faster. So, the Olympics keep coming at you.RIVERA: That was it. That was it.GUTFELD: So, that's what I'm saying. I'm like David Wooderson in ""Dazed and Confused"" about when I was in high school, you know, he gets older but everybody stays the same age. The Olympics, everybody stays the same age, and I'm going to die.RIVERA: But -- but, you, Meghan, you must be inspired.MCCAIN: Yeah, I mean, who isn't? And I ...RIVERA: He isn't, but it's up for him.MCCAIN: If you watched Simone Biles', she's like not human. She's like -- it's like watching someone out of the matrix being able to fly around, she's incredible.GUILFOYLE: She really is, right?MCCAIN: It's incredible -- and I'm not like always huge on the Olympics, but she's absolutely incredible. And honestly, this is a little ridiculous, but Leslie Jones, this is actress, this comedian, the funniest Twitter feed, a possible so entertaining commentary on the Olympics. They sent her to the Olympics and I think no one is more excited in the world than she is to be there, and it's a really good Twitter to follow.GUILFOYLE: Oh, that's nice, good.RIVERA: Do you get the -- the Cold War, their knight, you know, the Cold War was fought out in the Olympic stage.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.RIVERA: Do you see it as a political, geopolitical topic?BOLLING: So, I'll take the politics on that. I remember President Obama said, you know, American exceptionalism is what we should be downplaying in and not up highlighting it. Here's the opposite, this is what it's all about, winning, winning on a global stage.I've got to tell you, last night, seeing Simone Manuel win and she tied, they literally tied for the gold medal. She looked up and her face, there was such shock in her face. When she started to cry, I'm like, welling up, bawling on my couch and watched. It's so, so, proud of the American athletes. And again, Simone Biles, they came up with their name, the final five, you know, forwarded (ph). Or one more thing should be called the final five.RIVERA: And Aly Raisman's parent's, you know, with all that body language, I think they should get medal for ...MCCAIN: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: And I love that you're able to tie it into Obama too.RIVERA: The diversity of the U.S. team is spectacular, it's everything great in America. I love it. ""One More Thing"" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Time now for ""One More Thing"". This is really a great story. The one more thing that Dana gave me is men and women who undergo lower limp amputations and they have a lot of challenges, right, in terms of being able to find a prosthetic that works for them, that's not painful that also can give them the enjoyment of life. And this something that's I found particularly interesting.Now, something that's very unique to females, as you can imagine, is we dress up and want to wear our heels. You know, what are the alternatives? Well, John Hopkins was straight to the cause. Engineering students have developed a prosthetic foot designed specifically for women who want to wear shoes with heels with an ankle they can that adjust to accommodate many heel heights. So, if you want to wear it like low heel, like a kitten heel, like Dana height or five inch like me.So, the prosthetic foot with the team of students named ""Prominence"" can be adjusted and fit to heels over 4 inches. You love the science, you love the innovation here, and for making people's lives feel whole and complete again. Very cool.And also, please join me tonight on Greta. I'll be in for my friend on the record at 7:00 p.m. and Mr. Bowling is up after me. And hi to my neighbor Leslie, I'm glad that you're feeling better. I was happy to see you today. Very sweet. Greg, in.GUTFELD: OK. 10:00 tomorrow night, I got Governor Gary Johnson. We're going to talk about a lot of stuff. I've also got Ben Domenech, we've got Rick Gurnel (ph), we've got a great comedian Bonnie Mcfarlane.It's good to be a blowout of a show. But more important, I'm going to ban a phrase in a while. Can we ban a phrase?MCCAIN: Yeah.GUTFELD: This phrase is, ""What you're about to see may not be suitable for young viewers. You may want to leave the room."" In the history of television, no one had ever left the room, instead, they go like this.RIVERA: That's the whole point.MCCAIN: We should say that as our tease now. We banned it.GUTFELD: Wait, who's after me? What Meghan is about to say in one more thing is may be shocking and you might want to leave the room. It never happens.GUILFOYLE: OK, but awkwardly now, awkwardly. It's Bolling and then, Meghan.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: I know you really want to hear this, right? By the way, your quid pro quo is -- that's hysterical, that line of the day.Very quickly, tonight, 8:00, ""The O'Reilly Factor"" special 2016 election, special, but you've been great all week. Thank you for watching and thank you for sticking around the DVR, that show ...GUILFOYLE: Great ratings rolling?BOLLING: Yeah, that's been great, thanks a lot.MCCAIN: My one more thing ...GUILFOYLE: Wake up America?BOLLING: America.MCCAIN: Yes.BOLLING: Yes.MCCAIN: OK. My one more thing -- sorry. My one more thing, my parents are watching this live in Sedona, Arizona. They have been campaigning throughout Arizona. I think I have a photo having pretty much the best time of anyone campaigning ever, that's them being attacked by a deer. It's a joke. It's then a prosthetic deer. Fake deer.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Hello, McCain family.MCCAIN: Hi, I've seen my parent, shut up.RIVERA: The greatest athlete at the Olympics, surprisingly, is a 68-year- old grandpa. He was on the subway. Someone offered him the seat in the handicap seat down there. You know what? That subways tab in the Rio Metro there. Instead, he stood up, put his hand on the bar and look what he did.That's Wayne Mcentire, 68 years-old, he's a dentist in Amarillo, Texas, and his grandson, Britain Barker sent us the info on him. My brother, Greg spoke with the ...GUTFELD: That's the best pole trump has seen in a while.MCCAIN: Oh, my goodness.RIVERA: Isn't there a picture of you doing this somewhere?GUILFOYLE: I know, exactly, this was Castro or something like that.RIVERA: I would be on top like, you know ...GUILFOYLE: And by the way, I also had Rob O'Neill on tonight, as well. And so we're excited about that.GUTFELD: He'd kill it.GUILFOYLE: Oh, he'd kill it. That's it for us. Have a great weekend. We're going to see you right back here on Monday.

8	8	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/11/06/state-department-spokesman-defends-keystone-pipeline-rejection/	State Department spokesman defends Keystone pipeline rejection	"This is a rush transcript from ""Your World,"" November 6, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.NEIL CAVUTO, HOST:  All right, it began with the State Department.  It was in their purview to decide yea or nay on this Keystone pipeline.  And they decided nay.  John Kerry said that he had weighed it very thoughtfully, carefully, and this had been something that had been kicked around for the better part of seven years.John Kirby, the State Department spokesman, with us now on the implications of that.John, it`s always very good to have you.  You know what a lot of Republicans are saying, bad move, bad timing, and all in the name of climate change, bad justification.  What do you say?  JOHN KIRBY, FORMER U.S. DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:  Well, look, we looked at this, as you said, exhaustively for several years.  CAVUTO:  What took so long?  (CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  If it was going to be this, why did it take so long?KIRBY:  Well, the process was lengthy, to be sure, but that`s because it had to include a lot of public involvement and public comments that were -- had to be taken into account.  So it was done thoughtfully, judiciously and, yes, it was done over a period of time.  It was really important, I think everybody understand, to get this right, not to get it quick.  And the secretary did determine, as you rightly said, that this was not in the national interests.And climate change and our leadership and ability to be a world leader on climate change was a major factor in his decision.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  Why are those two irreconcilable, though, John?  I mean, I`m going to give at face value that it took seven years to conclude that.  But was there a feeling that you can`t have this type of activity and be for addressing climate change at the same time, even though the alternative to getting this oil shipped around now presents a lot greater environmental risk?  KIRBY:  Well, I don`t think we share that assessment, to be honest, Neil.  I mean, we looked at all of the factors here.  And the fact is, it didn`t -- the numbers were one factor, obviously.  And it didn`t -- it didn`t -- when it -- in the end, that didn`t become a deciding factor, because it didn`t really affect the economy in any measurable way.   It wasn`t going to lower gas prices.And, as you said, transportation, what the secretary was asked to determine was not this method of transportation vs. this.  It was his -- he was asked to say, to determine the national interests of this particular pipeline.  So, while I can`t say that this very dirty oil is going to transport through the country through other means, which it might, what we did determine was that the pipeline itself was not in the national interests in terms of...CAVUTO:  But was it in our national security interests?  Hearkening back to your days talking about the Pentagon, there are a lot of military types all of types of politics, John, who say, well, I would rather be getting whatever we can energy-wise from this country and exhausting all means in this country, including wind, including solar, but certainly including this.Robert Murray, of course, the coal industry CEO, says that it`s tantamount to a war on the traditional fossil fuels that have given us this rapid decline in prices and the enviable position that we have now and we`re blowing it away.  KIRBY:  I think that`s actually an overblown, overstated argument.  Look, we have got to get more clean...  CAVUTO:  Well, look how low energy prices are.  What prompted that, all of this fracking, all of this alternative stuff, right?  KIRBY:  And so gas prices are lower.  You`re right.And we determined through this analysis that this pipeline would have no effect necessarily on those prices, but it would result in the transport through this country of some of the dirtiest oil on the planet, and that that is not in keeping...CAVUTO:  So, all their assurances that they would clean this and all these unions who wanted all these jobs saying that they were fulfilling their environmental responsibilities, were they lying?  KIRBY:  Again, our analysis did not show that this was going to have a measurable, tangible effect on jobs or on gas prices here in this country.  What it came down to was the potential for this pipeline to undermine our global leadership with respect to climate change.  CAVUTO:  All right.  Well, John, I very much appreciate your coming on and to state that case.KIRBY:  Thanks.CAVUTO:  Always good talking to you, John Kirby, spokesman at the State Department.KIRBY:  Thanks.  CAVUTO:  All right.  ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

9	9	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/11/06/bill-oreilly-what-has-happened-to-democratic-party/	Bill O'Reilly: What has happened to the Democratic Party?	"In a disgraceful exhibition yesterday, one that will go down in history as a blight on American politics, the senate minority leader, Democrat Harry Reid killed Kate's Law, at least for now.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REID: The new mandatory minimum sentences the bill would create would have a crippling financial effect. This is yet another attack on the immigrant community.DOBBS: I truly believe that what Harry Reid is doing here is pure evil. I think Bill O'Reilly has it exactly right. I believe Ted Cruz has it exactly right. And it demonstrates why we have got to go to regular order in this government.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: What Lou Dobbs is saying is that one senator, Reid, should not have the power to derail legislation. But even though Kate's Law will likely come up again for a vote, it seems certain most Democrat senators will not support the measure that's designed to protect all Americans from thugs like the guy who shot and killed Kate Steinle in San Francisco.As you may know, that illegal alien had seven felony convictions, came back six times after being deported. I mean it's insane. Nevertheless, Democrat senators like crazy left Sherrod Brown in Ohio oppose mandatory five-year prison terms for such individuals. Brown saying, quote, to his constituency: ""The mandatory minimum sentences established under this bill, Kate's Law, would waste taxpayer money by increasing the federal prison population."" Yes, that's right, Senator. Convicted aggravated felons who defy deportation would wind up in prison under Kate's Law instead of running around sanctuary cities like San Francisco selling drugs and shooting young women in the head. Brown is a disgrace. How Ohioans ever elected him is a mystery of the universe.Now, as talking points reported yesterday, Americans overwhelmingly support Kate's Law. Think about it. Who would oppose the law? Who would oppose this? I can't figure this out. Democrat senators like Bob Casey, Dianne Feinstein, Patrick Leahy, Claire McCaskill, Bill Nelson -- these people should openly embrace Kate's Law. Instead, they remain silent and will remain so unless pressured by their constituents. On that front, I'm not hopeful.Last week a guy from the Media Research Center went to a pro- immigration rally in Colorado.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you heard of Kate's Law?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you heard of Kate Steinle?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you ever heard of Kate's Law?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, I have not.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't like you asking the people here the questions that you are asking.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: See, we got it he doesn't like the questions.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ok. Well -- thank you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Perfect. I knew you were something else.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You are welcome to leave.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are welcome to, of course. We don't have to.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You are not going to interview anybody else.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why not? How can you stop them?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because I just said.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: They shut him down.Now, we should point out that both President Obama and Hillary Clinton have also been silent on Kate's Law. So we have to assume they oppose it. Again, that's scandalous. It's a very simple concept that would protect all Americans. Mandatory prison terms would give law enforcement another tool to dismantle gangs operating in the U.S.A. and would discourage convicted aggravated felons from coming back here after being deported. But, once again, the Democratic Party will not support Kate's Law.It is beyond a reasonable doubt the DNC is incredibly radicalized. There don't seem to be any moderate Democrats anymore because if you are a moderate Democrat you are scorned by your peers. That's why Harry Reid can get away with killing Kate's Law which, of course, would prevent even more killing.My apologies to the family of Kate Steinle -- you do not deserve this. And I'm not giving um. We will get that to the senate floor again. They need 60 votes. And we will try to convince some Democrats to support it. That's all I can do.That's ""The Memo"".Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years.
