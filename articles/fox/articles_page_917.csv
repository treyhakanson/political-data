"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" July 9, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FORMER GOV. JEB BUSH, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My aspiration for the country, and I believe we can achieve it, is four percent growth as far as the eye can see, which means we have to be a lot more productive. Workforce participation has to rise from all time modern lows. It means that people need to work longer hours, and through their productivity gain more income for their families.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Well, on a day when the Bush super PAC announced more than $103 million, the Bush campaign and Jeb Bush had to deal with that about working more hours. Hillary Clinton tweeting out soon after that came out ""Anyone who believes Americans aren't working hard enough hasn't met enough American workers."" Jeb Bush responding, ""Anyone who discounts 6.5 million people stuck in part-time work and seeking full-time jobs hasn't listened to working Americans @HillaryClinton.""Jeb Bush then offered this full-throated kind of clarification to The Washington Post: ""If we're going to grow the economy, people need to stop being part-time workers. They need to be having access to greater opportunities to work. You can take it out of context all you want, but high sustained growth means that people work 40 hours rather than 30 hours."" Let's start there. We're back with the panel. Jason?JASON RILEY, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, obviously, I know this will be a shock to viewers, Bush's comments were taken out of context by the Clinton campaign. Obviously to achieve the four percent growth that he would like to see and thinks we are capable of more people need to be working full- time. Bernie Sanders has said the same thing, that there are millions and millions of part-time workers who want to be full-time workers. The only reason we have 5.4 percent unemployment rate is not because there are so many jobs out there but because some people have stopped looking for work.BAIER: Senator Ted Cruz has said he doesn't want to attack other Republicans, but he didn't pass up on this one. A statement today, ""It would seem to me that Governor Bush would want to avoid the kind of comments to let voters to believe that Governor Romney was out of touch with the economic struggles many people are facing. The problem is that Americans aren't working hard enough. It's that the Washington cartel of career politicians, special interests, and lobbyists, have rigged the game against them."" Again, Washington cartel including Republicans.JULIE PACE, ASSOCIATED PRESS: Yes, I'm not sure this is going to stick on Jeb Bush the way that Romney's 47 percent comment stuck with him through the general election. I mean, it was clear he was not as precise in his language as he probably wishes he would and we saw in his clarification that he tried to make clear what he was trying to say.To Ted Cruz's point, though, we know that one of the Democratic strategies is going to be to try to make Jeb Bush look like Mitt Romney. They feel like he has things in his background, his personal wealth, his family wealth, that they can use. Jeb Bush, though, is a much different candidate than Mitt Romney, a much better candidate, we are already seeing. That is not going to keep Democrats and some Republicans from trying to make that line of attack. But I don't think this is one of those situations where that's going to be successful.BAIER: George?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: It's a bit thick being lectured on the life of the ordinary worker by Hillary Clinton, who has not had a job in the private sector since she was a rainmaker for the Rose law firm, the less said about which perhaps the better.But I summon in Jeb Bush's defense as a witness my man Bernie Sanders, who is going around saying, more or less correctly, that the real unemployment rate, if you count people who are unemployed and those too discouraged to keep looking for a job and those who are working fewer hours than they want to work, the unemployment rate is 10.5 percent. Now, he is a socialist. He is good at arithmetic, but he is probably close enough in that case. The fact is the workforce participation rate, if it were today what it was when Barack Obama was inaugurated the unemployment rate surely would be over nine percent.PACE: I think this is one of the things that can drive Americans crazy about politics, because this is a real problem in the economy that you have people who want to work and either aren't able to work jobs where they can make enough money, work enough hours to support a family, or don't find jobs available. Let's have a debate over what these candidates are going to do about that.BAIER: Who knew that George would be feeling the burn at the panel here.I want to play this one sound bite from the interview I had with Jeb Bush the other day in New Hampshire. Full piece runs Tuesday, but asking about vulnerabilities for Hillary Clinton.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: What's the biggest vulnerability for Hillary Clinton?BUSH: It's her, just this protective shield she wants to create around her candidacy. I just don't think it's going to work, and the fact that she can't be trusted. There is never a straight answer, whether it's the server, the emails, Benghazi, just constantly, you know, validates this notion that there are two sets of rules.BAIER: So when somebody says, you know, if it's Clinton versus Bush, it's going to drive down participation, people are not going to be motivated to head to the polls, what do you say to them?BUSH: I'm going to win the nomination and I'm going to run a campaign that will inspire people that their lives can get better. And that will drive turnout particularly among people who conservative and they just don't know it yet.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: They just don't know it yet. A little tease for Tuesday, the ""Contenders"" piece.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Journal Editorial Report,"" July 18, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.PAUL GIGOT, HOST: This week on the ""Journal Editorial Report,"" a deal has finally been reached to put limits on Iran's nuclear programs, but how much good will it actually do? And what does it mean for the Middle East?Plus, Hillary Clinton rolled out her new economic plan this week all while throwing major punches at Republican candidates just as newly announced candidate, Scott Walker, enters the race for the Republican nomination.Welcome to the ""Journal Editorial Report."" I'm Paul Gigot.This week, diplomats from six countries, including the United States, completed an historic deal with a goal of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. In exchange, Iran will receive billions of dollars in assets that have been previously frozen by other countries and be allowed to resume selling oil to the world's market.But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warns this landmark pact is nothing more than smoke and mirrors and will eventually prove detrimental to the Middle East.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: By not dismantling Iran's nuclear program, in a decade, this deal will give an unreformed, unrepentant, and far richer terrorist regime the capacity to produce many nuclear bombs, in fact, an entire nuclear arsenal with the means to deliver it. What a stunning historic mistake.(END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT: Joining the panel today, Wall Street Journal foreign affairs columnist, Bret Stephens; and Wall Street and Main Street columnist, Bill McGurn.OK, Bret, you didn't think this would go ahead because you thought the Ayatollah Khomeini, the supreme leader of Iran, would not, in the end, agree to a deal on these inspections. Why do you think he did it in the end?BRET STEPHENS, FOREIGN AFFAIRS COLUMNIST: They made him an offer he couldn't refuse, but in a good way, or at least as far as he is not in the Don Corleone way. Look, what I thought was --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: Good for Iran, you mean?STEPHENS: It's a superb deal for Iran. What I thought was going to be the sticking point was the ballistic missile issue because the ayatollah said clearly there was no way they would accept limits on the missile program.  By the way, on the American side, you have people like General Dempsey, the outgoing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, saying there was no way the United States could ever allow them to import ballistic missiles.GIGOT: In the he wanted they --(CROSSTALK)STEPHENS: And in the end --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: -- they agreed to eight years of restrictions on the imports of the technology for ballistic missiles.STEPHENS: Right.GIGOT: But only eight were.STEPHENS: So in eight years, Iran can import state-of-the-art ballistic missiles beyond simply what they are doing in terms of their own domestic production. Ballistic missiles are a key component to any nuclear program because that's the way you most effectively can deliver a bomb.GIGOT: What about the actual terms on the nuclear side of this bill? Was there anything you like in here? Because the president says, look, we didn't care about anything else, we didn't care about Iran's other activity, terrorism, all we were focused on was this nuclear deal. Did he put enough restrictions on?BILL MCGURN, WALL STREET & MAIN STREET COLUMNIST: Yes. I think actually it's the wrong question to ask, what restrictions Iran has because if you look at this deal, the restrictions are all on us. Who can inspect the plants, what the timetable is. The sanction that were removed, they were put in place over years, and the idea that they're going to snap back if Iran violates, it's just crazy. You can't -- you just simply can't do it that fast. I think the real way to look at this deal, all the restrictions that it puts on us.GIGOT: Wait a minute. They would say -- the president would say, and it is saying this does put restrictions on Iran. All of their current nuclear facilities must be -- are going to be inspected. They're going to have to shrink their stockpile of uranium. They're going to have to put -- turn the Fordo facility into something that is just a research facility.  Although, when we originally said it should be shut down, now it's a research facility. There are real restrictions on Iran.STEPHENS: Yes, there are. That's true, but they go away after certain periods of time.(CROSSTALK)STEPHENS: Yeah, after certain periods of time. In the meantime, Iran maintains all the, or almost all of its nuclear infrastructure, it's allowed to do research and development on more advanced centrifuges that it would then be able to quickly build and field after the restrictions apply.  And then you have the president's claim that this deal puts Iran under this unprecedented verification and monitoring.GIGOT: Right.(CROSSTALK)STEPHENS: First of all, that's not true. We had a much tougher monitoring regime with Iraq before the Iraq war. Also, there are all kinds of restriction on what U.N. nuclear watchdogs can look for in terms of the undeclared facilities. We know what this place is like Esfahan (ph), Fordo, Iran and so on. The reason you have inspections is because you have to find out if they're doing something on the side that they shouldn't be doing.GIGOT: All right.MCGURN: The restrictions themselves don't mean anything unless you can verify them. I mean, the operating philosophy have been distrust and verify. The question with all these details is can we really verify. It's very unclear, it's a very -- we'll probably all disagree what they actually mean. The terms are very murky, and that is to Iran's benefit.GIGOT: What impact will this have on the rest of the Middle East, Bill?  Is this going to influence how -- what about the Saudis, for example? You heard Benjamin Netanyahu. But the Israelis, unless they decide, and I doubt they will, they can only influence American politics. They can't do much against Iran. What about the Saudis?MCGURN: Look, this is doing more for Israeli-Arab unity than any other measure --(LAUGHTER)-- that's come out of this administration. The Saudis and the Israelis are on the same page. They worry about Iran.GIGOT: Can they do anything --(CROSSTALK)MCGURN: And that's not new. They've been worried for a long --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: But can they do anything about it?MCGURN: Well, they can get their own weapons, right?STEPHENS: And this exactly -- I mean you heard Prince Turki (ph) in March, the former Saudi intelligence minister, say whatever this deal this gives Iranians, we will seek to have the same. We've other senior Saudi princes tell us about an arrangement they have with Pakistan, presumably meaning that Pakistan will provide them with nuclear weapons.GIGOT: Off the shelf weaponry.STEPHENS: So the president is making the claim that this deal stops proliferation in the Middle East. This deal guarantees proliferation.GIGOT: All right. Thank you, gentlemen.When we come back, the political effect of this nuclear deal and how Congress is reacting to it.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(FOX NEWS REPORT)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS & PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It is catastrophic.  If it goes through, it will result in funding terrorism. It will endanger the lives of Americans. It will endanger Israel.REP. MIKE MCCAUL, R-CALIF.: This will result in a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, R-ARIZ.: I predicted, in desperation, that the president and John Kerry would make a bad deal. It looks very much they made a worse deal than we had even fears.(END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT: Reaction from several lawmakers about the highly controversial nuclear deal with Iran. A congressional vote on the accord is not expected until September but Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker says they will begin reviewing the agreement next week. Will this nuclear deal actually see the light of day?Joining the panel to discuss is Potomac Watch columnist, Kim Strassel.So, Kim, do you think the president is going to get a majority of the U.S. Congress and the House and Senate to support his deal?KIM STRASSEL, POTOMAC WATCH COLUMNIST: I do, in the end. There's a big fight going on right now. The Republicans are likely to introduce a resolution of disapproval. They hate this deal. But --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: But, Kim, will he get a majority of the members in both houses?  Not to approve this. Will he get more than 50 percent to agree with him to approve the deal?STRASSEL: Oh, absolutely not, no.GIGOT: OK.STRASSEL: No, no, no. Let's be clear, all of the Republicans will oppose this in the end. The only question is, can he hold back enough Democrats from joining with Republicans to put forward a filibuster or an override of his veto. So the majority of Congress is not going to approve of this and he's going to be out there on his own.GIGOT: The way this is structured, all he needs is 34 Senate votes to pull the veto in order to let this go forward.Bill, what do you think?MCGURN: Yeah. I think --GIGOT: Do you think he can afford it?MCGURN: I think he is going to get enough. He needs one-third of the Senate to do it. The interesting thing is, if you look at the polls, the polls show most Americans pretty consistently have favored a deal, but they also show most Americans don't trust Iran.GIGOT: Right.MCGURN: And I think the president is playing that. But so far, we've heard a very one-sided picture form the president. Now that we have a deal and people are talking about the terms, it's going to drop those numbers.  And it's telling that the Republicans are pretty united. It's not like same-sex marriage or some other issue where a lot of people are wavering.  The Republicans don't seem to be fearing public opinion.STEPHENS: And there are Democrats who are going to vote against this deal.GIGOT: How many in the Senate do you think, Bret?STEPHENS: I think probably seven or eight will have to -- we will have to see. Some of them are going to vote against the deal because they have constituents who expect them to vote against the deal. They know that it won't cost the president in the end because he'll be able to override --(CROSSTALK)STEPHENS: -- a veto. The point is not whether Congress, this Congress can stop this deal.GIGOT: That's unlikely.STEPHENS: I think that's highly unlikely. The question is, do you weigh the political predicate to making this deal toxic for the presidential candidates and for the next president?GIGOT: Kim, on that point, what about Hillary Clinton? She's saying, look, I support this deal, it's a good deal, but I don't trust Iran. She's exactly right where Bill said the polls are. Imagine that.(LAUGHER)But Republicans in the presidential race, on the other hand, are all uniformly, so far as I've seen, against it.STRASSEL: Yeah. You hear a lot of Democrats out there making the argument that Hillary is playing the smart card here, that this is setting up Republicans to look like the war party, for instance. If you go back to Bill's point about the polls, I don't really buy that. I think there are a lot of Americans who are anxious about this deal. You put it in the context of their mistrust of the president's handing of foreign policy in general, and also the fact that -- a lot of Americans understand we have hostages being held by Iran at the moment. They're not happy about that either. The president is getting tough questions on that. So I'm not sure this is a slam dunk for Hillary Clinton to simply jump on board with this and suggest this is a political winner.GIGOT: The only -- the split I've seen with the Republican presidential candidates, Bret, is those that say I'm repudiate it on day one if I'm inaugurated, and those that are not saying that. They're saying we oppose the deal, but they're not making that demand.STEPHENS: Well, the truth is that the next president is going to have a hard time walking away simply because --(CROSSTALK)STEPHENS: -- this deal binds us and ties you us down.GIGOT: And it's the U.N. commitments that we're making which are -- that you can't just do it if you are --(CROSSTALK)STEPHENS: The president is going to have to make a major foreign policy break, the next president, if he's going to walk away from this deal. And that's going to take some intestinal fortitude. It will help if he has the polls and the American people on his side.GIGOT: And Chuck Schumer, the Senator from New York, he's always on the fence on these things because he has real constituents that will oppose this. On the other hand, he needs the left wing of his party to be the next Democratic --(CROSSTALK)MCGURN: Yeah, and guess which one I think is he going to choose?(LAUGHTER)Look, in Israel, both parties are against this deal, right?GIGOT: Left and right.MCGURN: And you can bet that Chuck Schumer will come out for it.GIGOT: All right.When we come back, Hillary Clinton debuts her economic policy plan. Plus, Scott Walker joins the ever growing list of GOP candidates in the race for president.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT: Democratic presidential front-runner, Hillary Clinton, unveiled her economic agenda this week saying it would boost the American incomes and push companies to share profits with employees. During her speech, Clinton also took aim at her Republican opponents, including Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who jumped into the race this week claiming he made his name by stomping on public worker rights.Here to discuss is editorial board member, Joe Rago; assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman. And back with us, ""Potomac Watch"" columnist, Kim Strassel.So, Joe, is Mrs. Clinton's plan more Bill Clinton, more Barack Obama, or something different?JOE RAGO, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: Well, I think she's running for a third term and it's not her husband's. Mrs. Clinton is running as Obama plus.GIGOT: Plus. What do you mean by that?RAGO: She's saying I'm going to defend and consolidate all the economic policies that the president has achieved over the last eight years and then I'm going to add other things. I'm going to add a right to child care, potentially a higher minimum wage, profit sharing and so forth. The contradiction is that she says wages aren't rising fast enough --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: And she concedes that?RAGO: She concedes that. She says the economy isn't growing fast enough and investment is too slow. So she's basically saying the soup is terrible and the portions are too small. She's saying we need more of the same policies that have failed --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: Obamanomics haven't delivered for middle class incomes so we need more of it?RAGO: Exactly.GIGOT: OK.All right, James, is that going to fly?JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: She may have been feeling the burn --(LAUGHTER)-- The threat for Bernie Sanders on her left flank, feeling she needs to address that. We were talking on the show last week, wondering which way she was going to go. She's obviously decided to turn left. Now it's going to be a question for Democratic primary voters, does she mean it? And would the Clintons, do they mean it is always the question. I think in terms of what she staked out on policy, she is going to have a very strong case to hold on to the left wing of the Democratic party --(CROSSTALK)FREEMAN: -- because it is Obama plus, as we were mentioning, a lot more regulation of the work place, higher taxes.GIGOT: So here is the question, Kim. James suggested this is feeling pressure from Bernie Sanders on the left. I assume also from Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. But is this also the real Hillary Clinton, the Hillary Clinton who used to be before Hillary-care blew up in 1994, went into hibernation while Bill Clinton was president, now can express herself and say this is the big government, activist, liberal Hillary Clinton we knew and loved back in the '70s and '80s?STRASSEL: I think that's absolutely right. There were always questions.  Look, Hillary Clinton is very politically savvy and her husband's politics helped him get re-elected in the White House and she sat quietly by as that happened. Everyone knows she was the more liberal side of that team.I think here's what she's doing. Hillary Clinton knows her path to the White House or she believes her path to the White House is through the old Obama coalition of younger voters, minorities, single women voters. But her problem is she's not Barack Obama. She does not have the ability to inspire and enthuse people in any way. She is a doer speaker. She is just not him. She feels she has to do this through her ideas instead.GIGOT: Politics.STRASSEL: And she is doubling down on his policies trying to get the ascendant liberal wing of the party to put their trust in her.GIGOT: All right. Let's turn to Scott Walker, James. He's out, a top- tier candidate among the Republicans, for sure. What are his strengths?FREEMAN: Well, he has guts and he's gotten a lot done in Wisconsin.  There's obviously a very talented field out there, but a lot of them are talented politicians without a whole lot on the resume in terms of tangible achievements, SO.GIGOT: What are his big achievements?FREEMAN: The big achievement is known as Act 10 and, despite great opposition, he managed to reform the state's public-sector union laws or the laws affecting them and that meant big savings for taxpayers, billions, in fact.GIGOT: And you could decide, if you're a union member, whether to join or not and pay dues. A big falloff in union, public-union membership.FREEMAN: Exactly. The biggest teachers union in the state, membership has fallen more than 50 percent. So what he has is a big victory under his belt in a normally Democratic state. And he's shown he has guts. I think that's going to be very appealing to a lot of Republican primary voters.GIGOT: Joe, let's talk about weaknesses. And one challenge is to show he can step from that state level on to the national stage and deal with all the issues of presidential candidate has to do, foreign affairs and, of course, national tax economic policy.MCGURN: Right. Can he break out from being merely a regional candidate to a truly national figure?GIGOT: What will he be looking for on that front?MCGURN: I think he needs to release some new material to begin with. His announcement was kind of a disappointment. If you followed him, we've heard it before invoking the --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: Nothing new?MCGURN: -- the sale at Kohl's on the sweater.GIGOT: The sweater.MCGURN: It's kind of his story. Can he break out from that, and can he learn from other people? He has a reputation as kind of insular, his own speechwriter, his own political strategist. Can he kind of elevate himself beyond what he knows on to the national stage?GIGOT: All right. Very good.Thank you all.We have to take one more break. When we come back ""Hits & Misses"" of the week.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT: Time now for ""Hits & Misses"" of the week.Joe, start us off.RAGO: Paul, this is a hit to the New Horizon's mission to Pluto, which beamed back the first photos of the last planet in the solar system, so far unexplored. It traveled three billion miles over nine years and it's an extraordinary testimony to human curiosity, to science and engineering, and to the spirit of discovery.GIGOT: All right.Kim?STRASSEL: A hit to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which this week called a unilateral halt to the witch-hunt the prosecutors were conducting against conservative groups in the state. Prosecutors claimed this was about campaign finance violations. In fact, this was just an attempt to harass and intimidate groups supporting Governor Scott Walker during his recall election. The court, to its credit, blew the whistle, said the case was unsupported in reason or law, and this was a big victory for free speech.GIGOT: All right, hear-hear, Kim.All right, James?FREEMAN: This is a miss to the IRS. We know they target conservatives, too.(LAUGHTER)We also know they grab pieces of our paycheck. But what they've also been doing is seizing whole bank accounts belonging to people who have been never convicted of a crime.GIGOT: It's civil forfeiture.FREEMAN: Civil forfeiture. A total outrage. And even after they said they're going to stop doing it, they're still sitting on the money in several cases. So, fortunately, the Institute for Justice is fighting back on behalf of some clients. But a big miss to the IRS.GIGOT: All right, thank you all.A compliment to our own Collin Levy, who did so much good work in the Wisconsin battle.And remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us on JERonFNC.That's it for this week's show. Thanks to my panel and especially to all of you for watching. I'm Paul Gigot. Hope to see you right here next week.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.TRISH REGAN, FOX NEWS HOST:  Breaking tonight, with just four days to go before the final major contests of the 2016 primary season, we are witnessing some of the worst that America has to offer.  A Donald Trump supporters find themselves being attacked by violent mobs.  And some on the left try to excuse these attacks by blaming the candidate himself.  Welcome, everyone to ""The Kelly File."" I'm Trish Regan in for Megyn Kelly tonight.  There's new reaction tonight to the ugly display we witness last night in San Jose California where anti-Trump protesters took out their fury on his supporters.  This is just a little of what transpired.  Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(BLEEP)  (INAUDIBLE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Put your hands on my neck!UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Hey!(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)(BLEEP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hey!UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He is egging them on.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, he is an idiot.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He's egging them on.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  (BLEEP)(BLEEP)  (END VIDEO CLIP)REGAN:  Afterwards, the two Democratic presidential campaigns largely remained silent on this matter.  Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders only addressing it when directly questioned.  As for some political commentators, they appeared to suggest this is just no big deal.  Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  Let's just not get carried away.  You know, this -- in the United States, this kind of protest has gone on for hundreds of years.  It's not that big a deal.  A bunch of people -- like the guy got his hat knocked off.  One person getting hurt is unacceptable. But it's one person.  I just don't think anybody should, you know, think that this is a bigger deal than it is.  As for the Donald himself, today he said this.  DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESUMPTIVE GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I'm proud.  It was absolutely incredible.  And it was a love fest inside.  We had just an amazing time.  And that was it.  And we wrapped up.  Everybody was cheering like crazy forever.  And then they walk out and get accosted by a bunch of thugs burning the American flag -- burning the American flag.  And you know what they are.  They are thugs.   (END VIDEO CLIP)REGAN:  In just a moment, we'll discuss this with Trump spokesperson Katrina Pierson and radio show host Richard Fowler.  But first, we begin with Trace Gallagher reporting from our West Coast Newsroom.  Trace.TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And Trish, even if you take eyewitness testimony out of what happened during the Trump rally in San Jose and just stick with what was documented on videotape, there were numerous violent attacks against Trump supporters by Trump protesters.   Some supporters were pelt with eggs.  At least one man was sucker punched as he tried to walk away.  And another man was blindsided and bashed with the head with a heavy bag.  The man who took the video of the bag attack says old people were also getting knocked to the ground and having their Trump hats stomped on.  He thinks San Jose police backed off for too long.   Watch.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TIM POOL, JOURNALIST:  When this man in the yellow shirt was coming out, there were several officers who did not intervene when the crowds are rushing at him, spitting on him and pushing him.  And, you know, I don't know what the reason for that is.   (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER:  Today the police came out and said the reason they didn't intervene sooner is because they feared it would insight more violent behavior.  But the mayor of San Jose Sam Liccardo, a Democrat who supports Hillary Clinton said his Police Department did an extraordinary job.  He blames Trump for coming to cities and igniting problems that police have to deal with, telling the Associated Press, quoting, at some point, Donald Trump has to take responsibility for the irresponsible behavior of his campaign.  In a follow-up statement today the mayor again blamed Trump for stirring the pot but finally denounced the violence against Trump supporters.  And Hillary Clinton echoed that by condemning both the violence and Trump.  Watch.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  This has to end.  He set a very bad example.  He created an environment in which it seemed to be acceptable for someone running for president to be inciting violence, to be encouraging his supporters.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER:  Bernie Sanders also weighed in, calling Trump reprehensible but saying we can't defeat him by throwing eggs.  And finally, there is the media influence.  Emmett Rensin, a deputy editor at Vox, which is a left- leaning news website, has urged people to riot if Donald Trump comes to town.  Rensin has now been suspended -- Trish.  REGAN:  Thanks so much, Trace.  Joining us right now with reaction to the events, Katrina Pierson, national spokesperson for the Trump campaign.  And Richard Fowler a nationally syndicated radio talk show host and senior fellow at the New Leaders Council.  Richard, I'll start with you.  Why don't we see liberals act more aggressively when it comes to condemning violence like this?RICHARD FOWLER, NATIONALLY SYNDICATED RADIO HOST:  Well, what we saw in San Jose, what we saw a couple of nights ago in Berkeley it's wrong.  Right? Violence should never be tolerated.  But what should be allowed is peaceful protests, people saying and speaking their mind.  That's our First Amendment right.  And that's what those folks are doing.  When they go to violence, it's wrong.  And they should be arrested.  They're thugs.  It's awful.  We've seen Hillary Clinton say that, we've seen Bernie Sanders say that, we've seen Democratic senators saying that.   REGAN:  It took them a while, Richard.  It took them a while.  FOWLER:  Also we've seen senators say that.  REGAN:  Bernie Sanders just moments ago said something in response when he was asked about it.  Hillary Clinton needed to be asked about it.    Katrina Pierson, why aren't the two leading candidates and the Democratic Party coming out, taking a stand and saying, enough with the violence?KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP CAMPAIGN NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON:  Well, you know, Trish, it's simple.  The media is not asking them to.  This started with the Chicago rally.  We know for a fact there were left organizations participating.  Bill Ayers himself was there.  I'm reporting on the ground. Move on.org was involved.  Black Lives Matter was involved.  There were tons of left organizations since that rally.  And these protests have done nothing but escalated.  And you played a clip earlier that was absolutely right.  These types of intimidation tactics have gone on in this country for years.  And it's always by the left.  And somehow --  FOWLER:  Katrina.   PIERSON:  They want to put the blame on Donald Trump.  FOWLER:  Stop!PIERSON:  We are not going to let that happen.   REGAN:  Let me jump in and just ask you, Katrina, if it had been, supporters for Donald Trump that were out at a  Hillary Clinton campaign rally,  and if they had acted like that, if they had thrown eggs at someone, if they were burning  flags, if they were insulting police, how would things be different right now?PIERSON:  Well, first of all, there would be a petition to have Donald Trump withdraw from the race and everybody else fired.  A Trump supporter could have just a sign that the left doesn't like and all of a sudden they will be labeled all these things and even attacked for that matter.  There is a double standard in this country.  And look, we have known for a very long time in this presidential race right now it was going to be one that was going to pit race against race and gender against gender.  That's exactly what is happening.  FOWLER:  Trish, I have got to interrupt.  The only person and the only person inciting violence and inciting hatred here is Donald J. Trump. First he made fun of a disabled journalist.  Then he kicked a journalist out of the press pool.   PIERSON:  That's violent?  Violent?FOWLER:  Well, let me finish.  Let me finish.  Then he told one of his supporters to punch him in the face and I will pay the legal bills.  That is what I call not only an assault on our constitution and an assault of what we stand for in America.     (TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)PIERSON:  In America you are responsible for your own actions.  REGAN:  Hang on, Katrina.FOWLER:  Katrina should know this and everybody else should know this.  REGAN:  Let me jump in.  (TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)FOWLER:  Candidates should never say we should punch somebody in the face.  REGAN:  Why do we not see Trump supporters acting like that at a Hillary Clinton rallies or at Bernie Sanders rallies.  It's only the Bernie and Hillary supporters that are acting like that at his rallies.   FOWLER:  And here's why -- here is absolutely why because what Trump is inciting is hatred against minority groups, he's inciting hatred against African-Americans, hatred against you Muslims.  PIERSON:  Hatred?FOWLER:  Yes, hatred.   PIERSON:  What is hatred?   FOWLER:  When you say you don't want Muslims to come to this country, when you say you want a judge off of a case because his parent happens to be Mexican, that is the definition of hatred, Katrina.  Maybe you don't read Webster's but it's the division.   PIERSON:  Hey, Richard.  Hey, Richard.  FOWLER:  Yes.   PIERSON:  Are you saying that ethnicity has no place in the justice system? Are you ready to denounce Black Lives Matter tonight?FOWLER:  I'm saying that ethnicity should -- the justice is supposed to be a blind thing.  That's the scales of justice.  Lady justice is supposed to be blind.   PIERSON:  But you supported Black Lives Matter.  You supported Ferguson.   FOWLER:  I do, I absolutely do.  I absolutely do.   I absolutely do.    PIERSON:  Now you are saying they have no place --  REGAN:  Richard, we should start with exactly what you said in the beginning which is that you don't condone violence and I'll tell you, the entire --FOWLER:  I don't, but Donald Trump does.   REGAN: -- Democratic Party shouldn't condone it either.   FOWLER:  Donald Trump does, Trish.  REGAN:  We're going to leave it there.  Thank you so much.FOWLER:  Donald Trump does.  Yes, it does.  REGAN:  Speaker Paul Ryan had strong words for Donald Trump just one day after finally endorsing the presumptive GOP nominee.  His comments coming in reaction to Mr. Trump's treatment of the judge in the Trump University case over his family's Mexican descent.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PAUL RYAN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Look, the comment about the judge the other day just was out of left field for my mind.  It's reasoning I don't relate to.  I completely disagree with the thinking behind that.  And so he clearly says and does things I don't agree with.  And I have had to speak up from time to time when that has occurred and I'll continue to do that if it's necessary.  I hope it's not.   (END VIDEO CLIP)REGAN:  But Mr. Trump's comments are not the only ones drawing ire tonight as Hillary Clinton seemed to make a loaded suggestion about the New York businessman's own heritage.  Listen to this.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  It makes no sense to me.  The judge was born in Indiana.  Yes, he is of Mexican heritage.  Donald Trump is apparently of German heritage.  I mean, what is that mean?  We are all Americans.   (END VIDEO CLIP)REGAN:  Joining me right now.  Attorney and Trump supporter David Wohl as well as Guy Benson, a Fox News contributor and political editor at Townhall.com.  Good evening, gentlemen.   DAVID WOHL, ATTORNEY:  Hi, Trish.   REGAN:  David, how do you interpret what we just heard from Hillary Clinton where she referred to Donald Trump's German heritage?WOHL:  I think it's just a garbage.  I mean, the whole thing is ridiculous. You know, when Donald Trump said Mexican referring to the judge.  I mean he would agree with me that there are tremendous numbers of Latino lawyers and judges that do outstanding jobs.  I work with them every day of the week. What he is referring to at Judge Curiel is his membership in La Raza Lawyers Association which is an activist association which caters to Latino lawyers and professionals.  But that's fine for lawyers.  But when a judge is a member of this organization, it raises an influence of bias and then when you couple that with adverse rulings this judge has basically sent down after Donald Trump -- his policy statement with immigration --  (CROSSTALK)REGAN:  You know, it's our understanding David -- it's our understanding that that organization is actually not directly related to La Raza.  WOHL:  It is directly not related but it is -- it caters exclusively to Latino lawyers.  I looked at the website today, it's not directly affiliated with the one causing the violence at the rallies.  That's correct.   REGAN:  Okay.  I want to leave that aside.  And we'll get back to it in a minute.  But Guy, back to what Hillary Clinton said there, it seems to me that by her trying to say, okay, you know, Donald Trump has German heritage-- and you can infer from that what you want, it seems to be kind of playing his game.  And I don't know if that works.  GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I mean I think what Hillary Clinton said for the most part, and I am loathe to defend her because I strenuously oppose her candidacy, but she is right, the fact that this judge's parents happen to be from Mexico.  He was born in Indianapolis, a U.S. citizen, that has no bearing whatsoever on the facts of this case in Trump University, which pertains to alleged ramp and fraud at that fake failed university.  And to invoke the irrelevancy in such a gratuitous way of this judge's cultural heritage the way Donald Trump has for months by the way, making it most explicit just in the last few days, it's race baiting, there's nothing else you can call it, it's race baiting, and it's repulsive.   REGAN:  David is that what it is?WOHL:  No.  No.  I disagree completely.   BENSON:  Of course.   WOHL:  I mean, what they have to do -- basically Donald Trump at this point has to get evidence that the judge is engaged in maybe lectures that indicated biased towards Donald Trump or toward strict immigration laws. Maybe letters, maybe e-mails, lectures, and then attached that to a motion to have him recused.  Or my suggestion is, very simple, do a settle mountain that admits no liability, whatsoever, get this thing out of the way, and get onto the issues that mean something and get onto the complain that will put him in the White House where he should be.   BENSON:  Hang on.REGAN:  Okay.  Guy?   BENSON:  Do you have any evidence -- you just said get the evidence that this guy is biased against Trump personally or --    WOHL:  When Trump makes a policy statement, regarding a wall, Mexico will pay for it, when Trump makes a policy statement regarding strict enforce immigration laws or deportation mysteriously rulings come down from these judges that are adverse to Donald Trump's case.  So that is at least circumstantial evidence to some degree of bias and it needs to be investigated.  REGAN:  Let me ask you this.  Because, you know, I think a lot of people will say, you know, maybe he shouldn't have mentioned that the guy was Mexican.  Maybe that took it a little bit too far.  Guy, if he perhaps doing something else, I mean, think about it.  Just a couple of days ago everybody in the media was talking about Donald Trump swindling people, swindling people out of hard earned money.  And now all of a sudden they are talking about his bias against or perceived bias that the judge may have had because he wants to build this wall.  Is this perhaps him yet showing another example of how he's twisting the story and getting ahead in front of the media?BENSON:  I mean, okay, so we're transitioning from a focus on Trump University, which isn't going away and the alleged fraud that went on there, bilking people who couldn't afford it out of tens of thousands of dollars and then denying it even though there are lots of evidence.  And let's transition for pr purposes to race baiting a judge based on absolutely no evidence whatsoever.  The suggestion is -- I mean it's very clear.  WOHL:  Guy, does the judge have Mexican heritage, Guy, does he?BENSON:  Yes.   WOHL:  I'm not sure that that's necessarily a bad thing to say.  That there is a lot of wonderful Mexican judges and lawyers.  Why is that such a horrible thing to say?   REGAN:  OK.  Well, you know what, the story is going to live on, this debate is going to live on.  And we were going to continue to be all over it.  Good to see you guys tonight.  Thank you very much.   BENSON:  All right.  Thank you.REGAN:  All right.  Here we are.  Just a couple of days away from the all- important California primary.  And a new poll shows Bernie Sanders is in a dead heat with Hillary Clinton in the Golden State.  Chris Stirewalt is here with a look at why Hillary Clinton needs to seal the deal.  Can she?And as the White House announces nearly 5,000 more Syrian refugees resettling here in the United States of America, there are new concerns tonight about background checks.  Tony Schaeffer is going to tell us what he is hearing about potential terrorists in our midst before Duncan Hunter tells us about a smuggling ring bringing potential terrorists right here to our doorstep.   And just this week, President Obama took a victory lap on the economy.  But that was before some of the worst job numbers in years showed up.  Tucker Carlson and Alan Colmes are here on how this economic news affects the race for the White House.  I'll see you back here in two.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRES. BARACK OBAMA, D-UNITED STATES:  By almost every economic measure, America is better off than when I came here at the beginning of my presidency.  (END VIDEO CLIP)REGAN:  Breaking tonight, just days before the critical California Democratic primary, where Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are battling for every vote they can get, a new Los Angeles Times poll finds for the first time Sanders leading  Clinton in eligible primary voters.  Joining me now, Fox News digital politics editor Chris Stirewalt.  Chris, California is a big state.  Why can't she seem to win it?CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR:  Well, look, she was favored to win it all along.  What you are seeing is that as it gets to the end, what she wants to be an exclamation point on her campaign, on her candidacy is turning into a question mark.  Is the largest state, the most important Democratic state, the source of the largest number of Democratic electoral votes, all of that jazz out there, why can't she quite button this up at the end?Because let's face facts.  She is so close to getting over the top that by the time we get to California on Tuesday, the number will be there.  She will have surpassed that number.  But if Bernie Sanders wins California, you know what he is going to do?  He is going to stay in the race.  He will linger around and say, hey, I won the biggest said.   REGAN:  Wow!  What does he want?STIREWALT:  To be a living hell for Hillary Clinton.  To create the maximum amount --  REGAN:  Hasn't he already done that?STIREWALT:  He certainly has.  But what he wants to do is make it very hard for her to get elected president.  He wants to make sure she can't pivot to the middle.  He wants to make sure that she is so pinned down ideologically and in every way possible that when she does the thing that she is getting ready to do, you heard it in the speech that she gave this week that in between roasting Trump on a spit, she would basically remind everybody, hey, I am a very hawkish person when it comes to foreign policy.  I will bomb stuff and blow stuff up.  Remember that.  As she was talking about that, she wants to make a pivot to the center.  Bernie Sanders wants to nail her feet to the floor.  And if he wins in California, he will stay and fight for super delegates and all that stuff at the convention and it will be heinous.   REGAN:  Who would have thought?  Right.  Chris, thanks.  Good to see you.STIREWALT:  You bet.REGAN:  It was just two days ago that President Obama took a big victory lap on the economy out in Indiana.  Watch.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA:  By almost every economic measure, America's better off than when I came here at the beginning of my presidency.  We cut unemployment in half years before a lot of economists thought we could.  (END VIDEO CLIP)REGAN:  Hmm.  Now, a dismal jobs report out today showing that job growth has slowed to its slowest pace in nearly six years has economists warning that we may soon slip into recession.  And perhaps more alarming, nearly half a million Americans gave up -- just gave up looking for work all together.  Which is why many argue the real reason behind the drop in the unemployment rate the President just touted is all about people giving up. So much for this so-called recovery.  Joining me now right now with the political implications of a tough economy, Tucker Carlson and Alan Colmes.  Tucker, does a bad economy give Trump the advantage.   TUCKER CARLSON, THE DAILY CALLER:  Of course it does.  He wouldn't exist without economic anxiety, not with Bernie Sanders, the President.  I mean, that's just legacy -- nobody believes it.  He doesn't even believe it.  The truth is, the labor force participation in this country as of today is at levels not seen since Jimmy Carter was president.  Many people suspect that the economy is based on monetary policy.  Cheap money is not real.  And it has benefitted only a small percentage.  And by the way, for every immigrant allowed into this country under the Obama presidency, there has been one half a job waiting.  Two immigrants for every job created.  So, they are acting against the interests of American workers and --   REGAN:  So, Alan, I don't know how she runs on his economic record.  In other words, she still has to live him down.   ALAN COLMES, HOST, ""THE ALAN COLMES SHOW"":  Three million jobs.  We had months after months of hundreds of thousands of job growth.  It's funny how conservatives are taking one month out of 25 months in a row --  REGAN:  No, no, no, here's the thing because you look at, you know, yes, 75 months of job growth.  Well, guess what?  I'll tell you these jobs, they are not good jobs.  COLMES:  Wait a second.REGAN:  A lot of them are part time jobs.  They are not paying anything. Wages haven't gone anywhere in eight years.   COLMES:  It took years to get over the depression, the 1929 depression.  He inherited the worst economy since the depression.  We've had month after month after month of job growth.  Millions of jobs created and people want to look at this little sliver of this month and say, oh that's it for Hillary Clinton.  He can't possibly win.  Because of what happened in this particular month.   (CROSSTALK)REGAN:  Eight year, Alan, eight years ago, people are earning exactly the same amount or less actually when you account for inflation.   (CROSSTALK)COLMES:  You're going to compare the economy today -- end of 2008 --  (CROSSTALK)We were essentially in a depression at that point.   CARLSON:  I don't think every person will blame any economic trend on any sitting president.   COLMES:  That's true.  But why blame this on Hillary Clinton --    CARLSON:  No, no, here's my question.  It's really simple.  Why would the administration let in twice as many immigrants as jobs that are being created during this same period --COLMES:  You know, actually deported more immigrants in this administration--  (CROSSTALK)CARLSON:  Hold on.  No.  Deal with the facts.  (CROSSTALK)That is actually not true.  COLMES:  That is true.  (INAUDIBLE)CARLSON:  You can't escape in the last two years, three million immigrants have come to the United States.  We have not created three million jobs in the last two years.   COLMES:  That's not true.   CARLSON:  That is not true.  COLMES:  Created millions of jobs in the Obama administration.   CARLSON:  The last two years?COLMES:  That's not true.   REGAN:  What I would add to what Tucker is saying is that it's not just about maybe filling jobs for immigrants and then keeping some for Americans.  You have population growth.  You have to consider.  You have to be adding at least 150,000 jobs a month.   COLMES:  And we have been doing that month after month after month and month.  You are taking one month, you're taking a sliver of one month --   (CROSSTALK)REGAN:  They don't pay anything.   COLMES:  Wages are increasing of five percent more over the past month -- five cents rather more over the last month.  Wages are higher than they were.  And you have to compare on what it was when Obama took office and look what's happened over the last number of years.  REGAN:  I'm going to give you the last word.CARLSON:  She has to run in the Obama economic legacy, she doesn't want to but she has to because she needs his core voters, anybody stuck with the Obama economic legacy is going to have a tough time getting elected this year.  Because nobody, even most core Democrats believes --  COLMES:  You have to prove that the economy is worse now than what it was when Obama took office.  CARLSON:  No, you don't.COLMES:  It's a hard thing to prove for the Republican --  REGAN:  I think you go out and you talk to any American, and they will tell you they don't feel very good about the economy or their prospects in it right now.  CARLSON:  Can't wait until November.   REGAN:  Thank you so much, gentlemen.Coming up, some troubling news concerning boxing legend Muhammad Ali.  We'll tell you what his family is saying tonight.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEH JOHNSON, U.S. SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  The President has committed to accepting at least 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year. It's a humanitarian obligation and commitment on our behalf.    (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)TRISH REGAN, THE KELLY FILE SHOW HOST:  Breaking tonight. Growing concerns as the Obama administration moves forward with the resettlement of nearly 5,000 more Syrian refugees in the United States.This, coming despite fears that the U.S. government cannot vet them all for ties to terrorism.In just moments, we'll be joined by Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer on what he's hearing from his Intel sources on the threat of ISIS terrorists infiltrating the refugee pipeline, and Congressman Duncan Hunter on a potential smuggling ring already on the southern border.But first, Trace Gallagher is live in our West Coast newsroom with the latest details. Trace.TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Trish, the president is still pushing to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees by the end of the summer. But it looks like that goal will fall short. And now the administration is being criticized by democrats, world leaders and human rights groups.The senior director of the International Migration Center said the U.S. talks a good game but doesn't follow through. President Obama blames anti- immigration sentiment and republicans like Donald Trump for stoking fears about terrorism.The president fails to mention that 47 House democrats joined republicans in voting to tighten the screening process for refugees. And some conservatives are pushing for an even stricter vetting process.But now 27 democrats led by Illinois Senator Dick Durbin have signed a letter saying the administration can and should do much more to accept the refugees.Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson says so far this fiscal year 2700 Syrian refugees have been resettled in the U.S. with an additional 4700 awaiting resettlement. But many of those are still being screened.Human rights groups blame the slow pace on red tape and lack of funding. But Jeh Johnson says that is changing. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEH JOHNSON, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  We've served resources for refugee screening in places like Turkey and Jordan. And we're going to get the job done. And we should. It's a humanitarian obligation and commitment on our behalf.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER:  And so far, Michigan, California, Arizona, and Pennsylvania have taken in the most Syrian refugees. Trish?REGAN:  Thank you so much, Trace. You know, we mentioned the concerns that ISIS and other terror groups could infiltrate those refugee populations. Those concerns are out there. And those warnings have not only been around for months. They have been coming from some of our nation's top officials.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHNSON:  We're not going to know a whole lot about the individual refugees that come forward from the U.N. High Commission on refugees for resettlement and vetting.JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR:  My concern there is that there are certain gaps they don't want to talk about publicly in the data available to us.JAMES CLAPPER, NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR:  I don't obviously put it past the likes of ISIL to infiltrate operatives among these refugees.(END VIDEO CLIP)REGAN:  Retired lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer is a CIA-trained Intel op now with the London Center for Policy Research. Colonel Schaeffer, what is the biggest risk for us right now, I mean, taking in 10,000 Syrian refugees?TONY SHAFFER, CIA-TRAINED INTELLIGENCE OPERATIVE:  Right. Well, they just said -- I'll tell what you the gap is that they are -- there is no data. We don't know anything about these people because it's not like someone immigrating from Germany why they have a long history. So, there is really no data. There is nothing to start with. There is no baseline.So, that's number one. Number two, we have to look at this fact, Europe has had a massive problem with immigration. We've seen massive terrorist attacks which resulted in death of citizens.Let's remind everybody that the job of the federal government is to provide common defense common and common good. San Bernardino resulted in bad immigration policies. So, what we have to do is understand that within this influx about...(CROSSTALK)REGAN:  What are your sources telling you about these people?SHAFFER:  Between 10 and 17 percent of these folks are going to be ISIS. We know that from both the intelligence we saw from the European attacks and what we've studied. what the intelligence have been studying right now.REGAN:  So, you're telling me 470 people.SHAFFER:  Yes. That's exactly what I'm saying.REGAN:  Could have ties to ISIS?SHAFFER:  They do, they will, in some form.REGAN:  So, why? Why are we allowing them in?SHAFFER:  For two reasons. First, political correctness. Again, Trish, we are ignoring the lessons from Europe. We have seen what happens in Europe and we're pretending it doesn't exist.Secondly, you have a president and an administration who are completely politically committed to a course of action which will essentially undermine our defense.And I can't give you why they're doing it. But that is exactly what they are doing. We know this.REGAN:  But it's not just President Obama, by the way. Hillary Clinton wants even more Syrian refugees.(CROSSTALK)SHAFFER:  And it's totally insane.REGAN:  She wants 65,000 refugees. You know we heard her speak on this recently.SHAFFER:  Right.REGAN:  Back in November. If we have a clip, let's take a listen.SHAFFER:  Sure.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  Slamming the door on every Syrian refugee, that is just not who we are. We should be doing more to ease this humanitarian crisis, not less.America's open, free, tolerant society is described by some as a vulnerability in the struggle against terrorism. But I actually believe it's one of our strengths.(END VIDEO CLIP)REGAN:  Colonel, to be an open and free society, don't you also need to be a safe society?SHAFFER:  I'm sorry. She is insane. This is the deal. The U.S. government's job is to protect citizens like you and me. The refugee crisis as tragic as it is it's not our making, we did not do this. What we need to do is find a solution which engages our allies like the Saudi Arabians and others who have a lot of territory that they can move them to.The Saudis have a lot of country, what we need to do is we work in without as supposed they speak the language, they have a similar culture, they're all Muslims.So, really it's odd to me that Mrs. Clinton would be professing the idea of bringing folks here who are going to in an alien culture who cannot assimilate, and let me be clear on this, we do not want to have clusters of radicals unassimilated like what we've seen in Europe.Again, it's bad policy resulting in death of Americans and we can prevent it now by understanding the basic facts which exist. We can do things to help. Helping in this manner is not going to be helpful and people will die.REGAN:  Colonel, good to see you tonight. Thank you very much.SHAFFER:  Thank you very much.REGAN:  OK. As if the problems with vetting Syrian refugees wasn't enough. Here we are tonight learning about a potentially smuggling network targeting our southern border.And according to U.S. government documents unearthed by our next guest this smuggling network has already brought individuals with suspected terror ties to the United States' doorstep.Congressman Duncan Hunter is a marine combat veteran and a member of the House Armed Services Committee. Congressman, welcome. What have you learned.DUNCAN HUNTER, MARINE COMBAT VETERAN:  Thank you for having me. Hey, it's very interesting and, you know, I'm coming to you right now from San Diego. We have known this anecdotally for a long time. Anybody that lives in Arizona, Texas, or San Diego, California, we know that there is folks coming over from the Middle East and Southwest Asia, and they are using Mexico to get north into the U.S.So here's what we just found out. Five Pakistanis and one Afghan were apprehended 15 miles north into Arizona. They were flown from the Middle East to Brazil. Then they went through Peru. They went all the way up through Panama and into Mexico and now they ended up in the U.S.The five Pakistanis as far as we know got away. They actually claimed that they were asylum seekers. Their names didn't register on any database. But the Afghan -- the Afghan did. The Afghan was involved with terror plots, planning terror plots within the U.S. and Canada.We know he is not a good guy in Afghanistan. And here he was in Arizona. So, here's the -- you know, that's the first problem is that there is not a secure border. No matter what the administration tries to say, it's not just people coming over looking for work. It's people coming over here to harm Americans.REGAN:  I mean, that's big thing here. We know, in fact in this particular case as I understand it this was Mexican drug lords who basically helped them with this smuggling ring to get these Middle Easters, including the Afghan that you mentioned who wanted to cause harm here in the United States and in Canada, who wanted to bring them into this country. And they'll do that for a fee, correct?HUNTER Yes. Absolutely. Yes. They will take anybody for a fee.REGAN:  They are willing to bring anyone in for a fee. And we need the protect against that. How can we?HUNTER:  You have to secure the border. Here in San Diego, we have a double border fence. You know, Donald Trump talks about the wall. We have a double border fence here in San Diego where hardly anybody crosses. Literally we have two giant fences with high-speed road in between that the border patrol drives back and forth.That has to go from the Pacific Ocean to Texas, and you can stop people coming in. Fences make good neighbors. And here's what's important in this case, too.(CROSSTALK)REGAN:  Is it more than that, though. I mean, not just fences do, we need to really be thinking hard about all our borders, I mean, we share a border with Canada as well.(CROSSTALK)HUNTER:  No, absolutely. But Canada is not Mexico.REGAN:  And let's not forget, Congressman, anybody from Belgium or from France that may have been born in those countries that has ties to ISIS, they can come here on a plane any time they want.HUNTER:  No, we -- true but we have stopped those expedited visas for those countries. We have now had to stop those and say hey, we are going to take a closer look at you. The upside, if they're coming from Germany or France is that we can look at your data, we can look at you, we can test with the German authorities, the French authorities.If you are coming up from Mexico, we can't test anything. And Canada is not Mexico.REGAN:  OK.HUNTER:  Mexico is a nation torn by drugs and crime. That is not Canada. So, here's what we have to do.(CROSSTALK)REGAN:  We have got a lot of work to do.HUNTER:  We have to secure the border. Yes. That's it. That's how you fix it.REGAN:  Congressman, thank you very much. Thank you for joining us tonight.HUNTER:  Thank you.REGAN:  Breaking tonight, everyone, the VFW is hitting back at President Obama after members felt the president slighted the nation's largest veterans group.

Because, you know, those writers those poets, they are just too white. And they are too male.We're going to talk about the latest in political correctness gone totally, utterly insane with Louise Mensch and Jason Riley. Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)REGAN:  Breaking tonight, new reports that boxing legend Muhammad Ali is hospitalized in very serious condition. A source closely connected to Ali's family says the boxing great is in grave condition and just hours from death.Yesterday, Ali was brought to a Phoenix area hospital with serious respiratory issues complicated by his Parkinson's disease. Now his family is gathered at his bedside. We will continue to monitor the situation and his condition.Well, there is new controversy at a major university tonight as students at Yale say their required courses on English poets, like Shakespeare and Milton are too white and too male centric.Now the Ivy Leaguers are petitioning faculties to quote, ""decolonize the courses.""Joining me with more, Louise Mensch, an editor with Heat Street and Jason Riley, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and author of ""Please Stop Helping Us.""Good to see both of you, guys. Look, it seems to me -- you are there at Yale University, or any university for that matter to get an education. And like it or not, part of the education is that foundation in the great, greats like Shakespeare.And you know, and I'm sorry, I don't think there were a lot of women or, you know, black people or any other minority writing at that time.JASON RILEY, MAHATTAN INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW:  Yes. I think it starts with the adults. There is no adult supervision at these schools. These kids ought to be told the truth. The truth is that, and this applies to minorities especially that there has never ban better time than in America today to be racial minority, to be part of an ethnic minority.You have tremendous opportunities. And instead of nurturing invented grievances I think these kids ought to do more spend more time working to make sure they can take advantage while these opportunities that are out there for them today.But they are not being told to do that. Partly because the administrators and the faculty tend to be former radicals themselves who are reluctant just to speak these plain truths.(CROSSTALK)REGAN:  Well, it's not just happening at Yale. There was a story on your site, Louise.RILEY:  That's right.REGAN:  About a Seattle University where kids are demanding that the dean step down because the curriculum had not been diversified enough?LOUISE MENSCH HEAT STREET EDITOR:  Yes. It's really a case of curriculum so white. And really just disgracefully in the case of Seattle they actually got the dean suspended because of a classical normal curriculum.It was apparently too western. We also covered Virginia tech disinviting Mr. O'Reilly for the crime. We have to follow the e-mails of writing about race in the Wall Street Journal because you may not be conservative while black.RILEY:  Yes.MENSCH:  The course at Yale is entitled major English poet, Trish, as an English woman I can tell you. At the time there were not a lot of ethnic minorities in the 1500s in England. And I don't protest when I went to Oxford when I study this, I didn't protest because there wasn't a lot of women. You know, that's the way the cookie crumbles. You can't be writing...(CROSSTALK)REGAN:  And by the way, nobody is preventing you from reading all the female authors...RILEY:  Right.REGAN:  ... all the African-American authors, all the gay authors you want. You can do all that too.MENSCH:  Yes.RILEY:  These institutions used to be dedicated to robust intellectual debate. That is no longer the case today. Kids are taught to shut down offenders not to debate them. They're taught to say I'm offended. That's the beginning and end of a conversation. It's unfortunate.And the irony, you know, we are going to let the generation that gave us the Kardashians determine the modern day relevance of Milton and Shakespeare? I think that's ridiculous.MENSCH:  I think Mr. Riley is exactly right. And the tragedy here is that there are so many students of color and otherwise who would kill to have that place at Yale, who would kill to have the opportunity that is being given to these students on a play. Instead of taking advantage of the opportunity in front of them they are crying their way through...(CROSSTALK)RILEY:  And we're not helping the kids by coddling them. In the real world there are no trigger warnings, there are no safe phrases. And they should learn that sooner rather than later.REGAN:  Yes. And, you know, I think you said something very important. And people forget this, they lose sight of this in Academia. Academia should be a place that welcomes the expression of thought, where thought is tolerated and examined and expressed. And we're seeing anything but that right now.MENSCH:  How is this different from book burning? How is this different from McCarthyism? Except in former decades it was those on the right who were burning the books. Now it's those on the left who are metaphorically burning the books. If you are at Yale and you are afraid of an idea then I feel sorry for you.RILEY:  If you are at Yale and you think that Othello or Hamlet creates a hostile environment you should -- you should be told to go to another school.MENSCH:  Yes.REGAN:  Good luck Yale's. OK. Good to see you, guys.MENSCH:  Thank you.RILEY:  Thank you.REGAN:  Louise, thank you for being here. Good to see you, Jason.REGAN:  All right. New reaction tonight from our nation's largest veteran's group. The VFW is striking back after they felt slighted by President Obama. And this is after years of a warm relationship. We have the controversy for you next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA:  God bless these American heroes. God bless all our troops and all of our veterans.(APPLAUSE)God bless the United States of America. Thank you, VFW. We're proud of what you do.             (END VIDEO CLIP)REGAN:  New reaction tonight to a different kind of response to President Obama from the VFW after being warmly welcomed by the nation's largest veterans group in the last few years. Members are speaking out after perceiving a slight from the commander-in- chief.Trace Gallagher has the details. Trace.GALLAGHER:  Trish, some veterans are quick to remind the president they're well able to think for themselves. It was during his Elkhart, Indiana speech this week where President Obama called out the conservative media and said those who listened are being misled and may have a skewed take on the states today's economy. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA:  We've been hearing this story for decades. Tales about welfare queens. Talking about takers. Talking about the 47 percent. It's the story that is broadcast every day on some cable news stations. On right-wing radio. It's pumped into cars and bars and VFW halls. If you're hearing that story all the time, you start believing it.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER:  Well, the VFW wasn't happy with the shout-out. The group's national commander released a statement yesterday hitting back at the president's remark quoting ""We don't have confused politics, we don't need left or right wing media filters telling us how to think or vote and we don't need any President of the United States lecturing us about how we are individually affected by the economy.""Adding the comment denigrated the service, sacrifice and intelligence of all men and women in uniform. The president is no stranger to the group of 1.7 million vets. Having addressed their convention several times including last July.REGAN:  Thank you, Trace. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)REGAN:  Thank you, all, for joining me tonight. And my thanks again to Megyn for letting me sit in for her tonight. Have a terrific weekend, everyone, and I hope to see you all on our business network, Monday, 2 p.m. Eastern for Intelligence Report.

"This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" August 25, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle along with Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""This spring, President Obama had some nice words to say about Hillary Clinton.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: She was an outstanding secretary of state. She is my friend. I think she would be an excellent president.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: But during a lunch yesterday with Joe Biden, the president reportedly gave the vice president his blessing to run against her. At the same time, his spokesman heaped a slew of praise on Biden at the briefing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: There is probably no one in American politics today who has a better understanding of exactly what is required to mount a successful national presidential campaign.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Charles Krauthammer thinks it's evident which one Obama would likely endorse out of the two.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That was a pretty broad hint from Josh Earnest that the president is tilting towards Biden. He says, I can't think of anyone else in the country, anyone else like Hillary, who could run a better campaign. Since 1988, Reagan handing over the torch to vice president Bush which is exactly what this scenario would be. Who would be the best person he would like to entrust with his legacy. The liberals have a vision of a 12-year rule. It would work perfectly for them.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: And here is a visionary, Charles Krauthammer. Dana, you and I are always agreeing with him.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: With Charles?GUILFOYLE: Absolutely.PERINO: And we're going to run away with him at some point.GUILFOYLE: At the same time.PERINO: Well, of course. This is one of the best and most fun developments of the election cycle for sure. I was also a little taken aback yesterday when Josh Earnest from the White House podium, basically said, ""I wouldn't rule out an endorsement from the president of the united states in the primary."" And also that the information coming out of a private lunch between the president and the vice president, actually so explicitly makes its way into a news report out of CNN says to me that the president definitely gave his blessing. Now, could it have been an encouragement like I would like you to run? I doubt it. I think that Biden probably came to him and said give us a lot of thought. I thought it through. I see a path. I'm concerned about her. I want to make sure that we solidify this legacy for the great eight years that you've had so far as president. And so I'm asking you for your blessing to move forward. And I don't see how President Obama could have denied him that. Unless, he really thought that Joe Biden couldn't win. And I also do think that if you look at Bill McGurn's column in The Wall Street Journal that he hits on something very important. Joe Biden really doesn't have anything to lose. He has been vice president. He has been in the wings what -- ready to take over if he was called upon to do so as president of the United States. He doesn't long for money. He's already been made fun of by everybody in the world. He's like at a saturation point. And somebody asked me, ""Does he have the stomach to run against what Hillary Clinton might be able to throw at her for all the things she might know about him?"" And I said, ""What about the things he might know about her?""GUILFOYLE: Exactly.PERINO: What might they think is happening, not just on the e-mail scandal, but other things? Or do they think the campaign won't work? And think about this. President Obama knows better than anybody else what her weaknesses are because he beat her in 2008 in the primary. So I think it's a very exciting development.GUILFOYLE: It really is. And then you couple that with the fact that he had the meeting with Elizabeth Warren. I mean, if you're in the Clinton camp right now you're shaking in your pant suit and your boots.(LAUGHTER)GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Well, Hillary's campaign is like a 02 breaking ball, down and out. A little baseball joke there. It's got to kill her. It's happening all over again. She's being pushed aside by a more appealing candidate. She's like the Susan Lucci of candidates, you see -- in the room, near the end, passed over. At least Biden that we know has a purpose. He will be the official curator of the Obama presidency. He's like -- to make sure the legacy is intact.GUILFOYLE: Yup.GUTFELD: Nobody destroys the herb garden. They don't put fattening foods back on the menu. He might actually do the tours. He just says, ""This is where President Obama used to think."" But it really doesn't feel like a presidency. It feels like a four-year hosting gig. Like he's like Sammy Hagar between David Lee Roth. He sits there until they get the next person. And he's fine with that because he spent all his life running for -- not all, like he's he ran twice for president. Now, he's not really running, and it's running towards him.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: And that teaches you a lesson. Sometimes in order to get what you want you shouldn't chase it, Juan.(LAUGHTER)JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Thank you. Thank you because I oftentimes chase.GUTFELD: Yes.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: And what happened to, end that would be? Side and out.WILLIAMS: Yeah, you know and it's a big car, too. I don't know what to do with it.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Now Juan, what do you have for us? Any inside information of things that you promised to never reveal or discuss with anyone else? Now is your time to blab.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: But I will say this, that when you see people -- talking this is kind inside baseball, but I just be brief, but when you see people like Anita Dunn and Bob Bauer meeting with the vice president. Now Anita Dunn was the communications director -- Dana shaking her head, but she is.PERINO: I'm nodding.WILLIAMS: Yeah.PERINO: You know I'm nodding.WILLIAMS: Yeah. She's a hardball political player. I think kind of nasty in my opinion. Bob Bauer, who worked with Clinton -- with Obama early on, knows the rules of how you set up a campaign, what are the deadlines for filing.GUILFOYLE: What does it take?WILLIAMS: Right. And now, what I'm hearing is that the vice president has major donors coming over to his house after Labor Day.GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: And this is a big issue because he's getting it late. And so will he have the money? He needs about $30 million. So let me stop with the inside baseball, but all of that would indicate that he's leaning towards this decision. But let me say there are a lot of democrats who think that all he's doing is playing to republican desire to scuttle Hillary because what's he going to do? He can't get to the left of Hillary. So what he's gonna say?PERINO: I would not think that.WILLIAMS: ""Oh, Hillary's corrupt. The Republicans are right. The e-mail scandal is a big deal and that's I'm running."" Well, what kind of a deal is that?JESSE WATTERS, GUEST CO-HOST: You know I think everybody needs to slow down on this Biden stuff. Obviously, Obama wants a 3rd term to some (ph) his legacy, and if Hillary implodes, Biden is the insurance policy. Think about it. Biden is the insurance policy. Biden's about as disciplined as a puppy, OK? Let's listen to what Biden said.GUILFOYLE: But everybody loves puppies.WATTERS: True, I mean, that's true. He might be cute.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: But it kind like run his face into the curb. Now Biden like told a guy in a wheelchair to get up and stand up. He mocks Indian accents. He goes skinny dipping. He drops the F-Bomb on a hot mic.GUILFOYLE: What's wrong with that?WATTERS: I mean this guy is going to be like treating the rope line.PERINO: All of that can factor in.WATTERS: This guy is gonna be like treating the rope line like a personal petting zoo. I think -- he needs an insurance policy. You know what that insurance policy is?GUILFOYLE: What is it?WATTERS: Elizabeth Warren. So you have the Biden-Warren ticket. And they're not going to have an e-mail problem because Biden doesn't know how to use e-mail, and Elizabeth warren uses smoke signals. So I don't think it's going to be a problem.GUTFELD: I saw that one coming from a mile away.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: Hanging curveball.WATTERS: That's right. I don't think Biden is gonna be that big of a threat.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WATTERS: I think he's just as much of a case to implode as Hillary.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: I mean I cannot take responsibility for anything Jesse Watters says.GUILFOYLE: Clean up on aisle five.PERINO: When I said that people have made fun of Joe Biden for years, what I mean is that all of those things are true. He said that he mocked the Indian accent, but I do think that all of that has been factored in. There will be plenty of time for criticism about Joe Biden if he decides to run, but today is a day to celebrate possible, entering some excitement in the race. Could I quibble with something that you said?WILLIAMS: Yeah, of course.PERINO: Why in the world would Joe Biden want to appease republicans who want, like.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, that's make sense.PERINO: Oh, Hillary's got out of the race?WILLIAMS: No.PERINO: What does he have to gain by doing that?WILLIAMS: No, he is. Well, let me tell you. This is I mean.PERINO: Why would he appease me?WILLIAMS: There's a psychological angle that's really interesting to me.GUILFOYLE: And you're about to dump a conspiracy theory on us?WILLIAMS: Well, it's a little bit of conspiracy. I'm just -- you know kind of inside gossip which is look. His son dies. The son -- reportedly told him run for president please, dad. Please run for president. He was, OK. He's 77-years-old, right? And he sees this is his moment to be remembered as more than a senator from Delaware or Obama's vice president. He could be President Biden. So is he reacting psychologically that moment? Is that why he's doing this? Way after the point? He should have announced if he was going to do this in the spring. Would have had a totally.PERINO: But I don't think that they know. I actually -- I think that he has been very thoughtful about it. And he has been watching Hillary Clinton's campaign, slowly start to unravel.GUILFOYLE: Yup.PERINO: And there are also had -- what do they have -- else happens since this spring? Bernie Sanders got in the race. He's got a lot of interest. Elizabeth Warren said she wasn't going to run or basically, he's got no indication that she would. So now you've got a split in the Democratic Party. Who could unite the party? Arguably, I think that Joe Biden is the most capable of uniting the party.WILLIAMS: Wait, wait, but there's no.GUTFELD: There's no combination of both of them. Like if you took Sanders and Hillary and put them in a blender, you would get Joe Biden.PERINO: Right.GUTFELD: Because he has kind of the stature and a little bit of the crazy old-fashioned.GUILFOYLE: But you know what?GUTFELD: But wait, can I -- the other thing that we're missing here is, we're watching the party turn on Hillary.GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: If that is a big story, I think they realize this is not, this -- I was going to say this dog isn't in the hunt, but I'm not because it's a clich,' that I banned. It's like the kid at -- nobody wants to sit next to that kid at the high school cafeteria because of the accident in the gym. That was she becoming.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Yeah, there's nobody that wants to get near her because they sense doom.GUILFOYLE: Because of the e-mail scandal, Jesse. She's got cooties right now.WATTERS: That's true, she had cooties. I'm gonna say.GUTFELD: That's' sexist.WATTERS: That's true. That is sexist.GUILFOYLE: Anybody can get cooties.WILLIAMS: Yeah.WATTERS: Everybody has cooties.GUILFOYLE: Cooties are unisex.WATERS: She probably got them from Bill. Now, but here is the thing.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: I don't.PERINO: Doubt it.WATTERS: Hillary could.GUILFOYLE: I doubt it.WATTERS: Be helped by Biden's entry, and let me tell you why. Hillary could play the gender card on Biden.WILLIAMS: Yes.WATTERS: Can do the whole Lazio thing. Remember he invaded her space, got elected and he was tossed. She could play the victim. You know Hillary is great at playing the victim. She could play the underdog.PERINO: She can also say she's not the older person in the race.WATTERS: That's right. He's older. He's whiter. You know, there's a lot.WILLIAMS: He's what?WATTERS: There are a lot of things.WILLIAMS: Whiter?WATTERS: Yeah, much whiter. Have you ever seen him dance? You see Hillary dance on the vineyard? She's got some moves.GUILFOYLE: Oh my, gosh.WATTERS: No, but she.GUILFOYLE: Dance off like Brittany and Justin.WATTERS: Could Biden -- Biden could -- Hillary could critique Obama and distance herself from Obama when she goes after him.WILLIAMS: I think you're on to something here.WATTERS: There's ways to make this work for her.WILLIAMS: But you know, I think you're on to something in terms. What's going on among democrats who I think are very upset about all this is that -- look, Hillary -- a lot of people think it's her turn. You know Obama, the black guy came.PERINO: But that what they said in 2008.WILLIAMS: No, no, no. And then Obama came and took the turn.GUILFOYLE: But that's like an entitlement theory. It's just that.WILLIAMS: It's not entitlement, but it seem like you're.GUILFOYLE: Wrong. You shouldn't be entitled to a presidency of the United States.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Gender selection.WILLIAMS: How come every time the republican that finished second gets the nomination next time?PERINO: Well, look how well that's done the last time that can work so well.WILLIAMS: Well, I'm just saying.PERINO: That can I throw a little cold water on the Vice President Biden thing?GUILFOYLE: Go ahead.PERINO: Because I do think it's worth noting that any vice president that served for two terms has a very hard time.WILLIAMS: Right.PERINO: Getting the nominations, only happened once since World War II. That was George H.W. Bush. He did not then win re-election. And I think you -- you just look at Al Gore. The thing for.GUTFELD: Do we have to?PERINO: The thing that's interesting is for years we've said that the great thing for Obama has been like what, Bush had with Cheney. Is that Cheney wasn't running for president. Biden has been very comfortable being the vice president. That's why I think it is totally on the merits that he has decided that she might not be able to got distance. They know they can't win with Bernie Sanders. And so who's the one person who could pull this together? They need insurance policy.GUTFELD: Jerry Brown.PERINO: And Biden is the good one.GUTFELD: Jerry Brown.GUILFOYLE: There are those rumors.PERINO: And I think he can raise $30 million. I don't think he -- he doesn't have to declare until the end of September.WATTERS: And I tell you what.PERINO: I have $30 million. I think they can raise it.GUILFOYLE: I think so.WATTERS: The media loves a horse race and they are gonna root, root, root, for Joe Biden.WILLIAMS: And that's a good point because I think the media is a little bored on the democratic side.WATTERS: They are.GUILFOYLE: The thing is I think he was probably measured and waiting the time that he has. He's not hurt by it because the more that you know Hillary is.PERINO: Last one in.GUILFOYLE: And it is like limping along, he's going to come in a little bit more fresh, people aren't going to be right away that's the guy with the gaffes because she's the one with the crimes.WATTERS: Yeah.(LAUGHTER)WATTERS: What's worse, gaffes or crimes?WILLIAMS: Wait until Jesse.PERINO: I'll take gaffes for $200.WILLIAMS: Got an opportunity to attack Vice President Biden.WATTERS: Yeah. We're just getting started.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: There's plenty of time for that.GUILFOYLE: Plenty of timePERINO: Today, let's just have fun.GUILFOYLE: And plenty of time for that.GUTFELD: And he just has to be there. This is the thing about Biden. He's not going to be a transformative leader. He's going to be -- he's seat filler until the democrat.PERINO: Although, he does know how to get a deal done.GUILFOYLE: He does.PERINO: If you think what he did with Obamacare, helped seal that and he helped -- government would shut down.WATTERS: He sealed Obamacare?PERINO: He is not -- from a democrat's perspective.GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: Yes, he did. And then also, what he pushed President Obama on gay marriage.GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: He actually could energize the race better than anybody.WILLIAMS: Race deal.GUTFELD: By accident.WATTERS: Well, he pushed him?GUTFELD: He pushed him like didn't he?PERINO: It wasn't accident. I don't think it was an accident.GUTFELD: Really?PERINO: I actually -- no, no. She's pushed.GUILFOYLE: She's making a solid point.PERINO: Thank you.GUILFOYLE: He's very good at bipartisan politics. He enjoys support and friendships to people on both sides of the aisle. I would like a little bit of that.WATTERS: I think she's just talking.GUILFOYLE: It got class in that way. And I really object to your disparaging comment about his penchant for skinny dipping.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Coming up.WATTERS: Sorry.GUILFOYLE: You got it. You got it, baby.A day in court for the suspect taken down by Americans on a train in France, what we can do to prevent a threat like that, here at home, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: The heroism seen on that French train is a wonderful horror story.It's wonderful in that we saw a fearlessness that we all wish we might possess in times of danger. What those Americans and that Brit and Frenchman did was wonderful.The horror is what the government didn't do. The government didn't stop that creep, so hundreds of passengers had to bank on a Yank. This Islamist was on three terror watch lists, yet there he was on a train bent on murder. If those brave men hadn't been there, it would have been pure carnage.Anyone taking a train these days makes a chilling observation: so many entrances so few securities. Cheap umbrellas offer more protection. And if it's not guns it will be homemade bombs or Bio-med attacks, anything is possible. The fact is the world has changed. States no longer hold a patent on violence. Anyone can do it and has. This forces us to grow up and admit that, aside from heroes, increased surveillance is all we've got these days. Given that terrorists are innocent of crimes until they commit them, that means our only good offense is a great defense. It's time we shake the Snowden hangover and recommit to national security. Whistle blowing is great in films, but in the real world you don't blow the whistle on your only chance for survival. Snowden's easy sabotage stands in stark contrast to those valiant men on that train. But as long as we allow our security to be dictated by rats, then we'll need to rely on the kindness of strangers on a train.I got to point out because I've been raging on professors for four years that Professor Mark Mugalian, I think it's how you say was the first passenger to tackle the guy. No, there was a French kid, French 28-year-old that won't be mentioned out of whatever reason, but tackled the guy and got shot. So I take back everything I've ever said about professors.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Until the deep lock when I go after professors again. But this is -- I mean, this guy, we talked about the other three fellows, but there I think -- there might be six or seven people loosely involved here. Every one of these people is an incredible hero.GUILFOYLE: Absolutely and rose to the occasion. It's something we can all learn from to be involved. Don't be a passerby in life especially when we all have something at stake here. The fight against terror should be something that united us globally. This should be a geopolitical fight on all fronts that we can engage in together and do things that are smart. What bothers me, is, when I hear people in this country and administration say things like, you know that's just not who we are when they do the apology tour and they are constantly worried about these PC politics when it comes to the fight against terror. Hundred percent, this is what we're talking about with the NSA, with the metadata gathering to make sure that they have all of this data points to. People that are out there, operators in the field, people that are putting it on the line every day, they need every advantage and tool that they can. They have no interest, really, in listening to Jesse's calls. They really don't.GUTFELD: No.GUILFOYLE: They want.GUTFELD: I tried it.GUILFOYLE: And this is the point, right.GUTFELD: All he does is talk about hair gel.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: It's -- it's a snooze alert.GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: So it's really uninteresting.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: This is what we want to do. Why do you want to hamstring our people that are working in national security and trying to maintain, you know, maintain our security every day to make sure that this country is safe. And in Europe, they need our help too.GUTFELD: This is what scares me, Juan is that we are relying on the heroism of strangers, when we should be really thinking about there's -- we can't wait until that happens.WILLIAMS: No, you can't. And but the thing is.GUTFELD: And it trains here.WILLIAMS: I was about to say, I mean, I ride the Amtrak, the Acela and there is very little security that is visible.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: And normally they tell you, you know if you see something, say something. But in that situation, I mean, I guess that they had sort of the equivalent of Air Marshalls on the Amtrak train.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: And they have an Amtrak security force, but you don't go through a magnetometer to come into Penn station here in New York or Union station D.C. You just don't.WATTERS: Let's not tell the terrorists that one.GUILFOYLE: I know.WILLIAMS: But I think they know.GUILFOYLE: Juan, take it easy.WILLIAMS: The question in my mind is what do people do? Because actually the experts say, you shouldn't just be running at the bad guy because that gives him hostages or you can hurt you. The question is how do you deal with this? And I think the government to come back to your -- actually, point. The government has some responsibility here.GUTFELD: I think the government has to be hand in hand with private businesses because there are actually terrorism is now using private enterprises and private pathways to come after us.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: They are going to use, you know the day that self-driving cars are a reality, they are going to use those. Google has to think about it. Every private company has a responsibility, I think. I don't know.WATTERS: That's true. And I think everybody forgets what it was like here after 9/11. Remember everybody was looking up in the sky when the plane was flying low. We didn't want to go into the subway because we thought there's gonna be some gas attack. You know the guy's dad on the train said the other day, cut the PC crap.GUTFELD: Yeah.WATTERS: Cut it out because we're dealing with a bunch of savages. To one of the reasons why Trump is resonating because he's like, this is like medieval times. People are getting their head shut off. There's rape room. This is disgusting. We don't like when the president goes out after Americans beheaded and plays golf and fist bumps. We don't like it when the president doesn't even say Islamic terror. It's very disturbing. And I remember.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Went off to the right. Oh my, God.GUTFELD: Just got thrown out of the.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: In World War II, if you look at the history books, they were gassing Jews in Germany and we didn't get involved until Pearl Harbor was attacked.WILLIAMS: Right.WATTERS: I'm not saying we have to go and invade Syria. I'm just saying we have to be more.WILLIAMS: No, no, no.WATTERS: Tenacious going after these savages in the sand than we are right now.WILLIAMS: I'm all with you. I'm with you.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, who are crucifying children, who have cooked children, there's so much horrifying information out there, factual information. We have to listen to the people that are in the theater, that are on the ground, that know what's going on.WILLIAMS: I agree.GUILFOYLE: Use the tools, God.GUTFELD: Could back to the -- my central point here is that it's not war. War isn't enough when the war is here. When the war is -- when the borders don't matter and they're in France or they're in the United States, we need as what Kimberly says we need every single thing at our disposal.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: I like the way you describe it as a Snowden hangover because now, hopefully, we can work our way through it, but there's two problems. Number one, what Snowden did was not just reveal that we actually had the capabilities, he revealed the capability.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: Capability is ruined. So all of that work, all of that money on a taxpayer dollars that went into building the capability to keep us safe, in that regard in terms of metadata, that's gone.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: It has to be rebuilt. So whoever is the next president of the United States, they're going to have to figure out a way to get Congress to put more money into that. Then number two is that, yes, I think private companies have a responsibility. There's a problem, Greg. Who has the highest approval rating of anybody in the world in Silicon Valley right now?GUTFELD: Apple?PERINO: Ed Snowden.GUTFELD: Oh.PERINO: No. They love him. They think he's a major hero.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: So they actually -- you have private companies that have the capabilities to help and then probably might be willing to, but from a public relations standpoint, they're afraid to.GUTFELD: Oh, that's sad.PERINO: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: We will just make them do it.PERINO: We'll compel them to do it.GUTFELD: All right, ahead. Ben Carson calls on Black Lives Matters activists who change the targets of their movement. Who he thinks -- who he thinks they should protest, next. Who wrote that?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: We're friends. We've gone to games together, but we don't share the same politics, that's republican presidential candidate Ben Carson. But he and I do agree when it comes to the misdirected anger of the Black Lives Matter movement. In an op-ed for USA Today, Carson acknowledges the right of protesters to be upset about issues facing the black community. But then he says they should concentrate on the real source of the problems, like the public school system in America failing black children.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BEN CARSON, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It doesn't matter what your ethnic background or your socioeconomic background is. If you get a good education, you write your own ticket. End of story. No ifs, ands and buts about it. One of the things I tell people all the time is during slavery, it was illegal to teach a slave to read. Now, why do you think that was? Because even those evil masters knew that an educated man is a free man.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Dr. Carson also calls out the entertainment industry that glamorizes black men as thugs and women as -- I'm just going to be polite here, trash, along with Washington government for failing to win the war on poverty. Carson says he is not the only black person who feels this way.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARSON: There are a lot of people in the black community who actually think the way that I do. But it's very risky to actually say it. Because then you'll be called a name, you'll be scorned, and that is what the established progressive party wants.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Kimberly, why is it that we don't see Black Lives Matter saying, ""Hey, I can't believe these drug dealers. We're going to go after the drug dealers. We're going to protest about black-on-black murder and crime, extraordinarily high, higher than any other racial group or community."" Why don't we see that?GUILFOYLE: Because black lives only matter some of the time, according to their movement.They should be the first people rising up in arms to say enough. No more black-on-black crimes. No more murder in our communities. We want places where our children can get an education, can play in the playground.WILLIAMS: Yes.GUILFOYLE: And not be slaughtered by a drive-by shooting or be collateral damage in these feuds and war that's going on in urban neighborhoods across America.WILLIAMS: You make an excellent point. I think they're locked in by the unions. I think they're locked in by their own -- and of course, they love to blame you, white man.WATTERS: That's true. They love -- they love to blame the white man. And you cannot criticize the black community in America, because the Democrats consider that attack and the Democrats are always on offense, and they strike back.If you're a black conservative and you criticize the black community, you're an Uncle Tom. If you're a white conservative and you criticize the black community, you're somehow a racist.But the Democrats have not been that great for black America. They keep the black people uneducated, because they don't support vouchers. They've surrendered the war on drugs. Open borders drives wages down for the black community. And, you know, with the easy welfare and the Food Stamps, it keeps these mothers single. It should be...WILLIAMS: Here we go.WATTERS: Well, it should be Black Wives Matter instead of Black Lives Matter. Because the family structure is the most important thing.WILLIAMS: See, I happen to agree with you 100 percent on that point. But I think once you start going into, you know, kind of demonizing poor people, you know...WATTERS: How did I demonize poor people, Juan?WILLIAMS: Because I think that's where Republicans fall off the cart.WATTERS: How did we do that?WILLIAMS: They get defensive. They say you're attacking people who are vulnerable.WATTERS: I don't see how I attacked poor people, but I'll let you believe so.WILLIAMS: So Dana, I want to show you something, because I think this woman works for Jesse. But her name is Peggy Hubbard.GUILFOYLE: She's amazing.WILLIAMS: She has a video that's gone viral. Here it is.GUILFOYLE: What do you mean she works for Jesse?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PEGGY HUBBARD, MOTHER OF MURDERED GIRL: Police brutality? How about black brutality? A little girl is dead. You say Black Lives Matter? Her life matters. Her dreams matter. Her future matters. Her promises matter. It mattered.You're tearing up communities over thugs and criminals. You think the police are out here for fun? You think they're out here for games? You shoot at them, they're going to shoot at you. That's just the realism of it. If you try to kill them, their job is to serve and protect, not serve and die.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Let me tell you something, Dana, I got emotional. I think God bless her. You are speaking truth. What do you think, Dana?PERINO: Well, I think she's courageous. And I was wondering if I could ask you a question. When you say it's gone viral, did it go viral amongst people like us here in the media, or is that more in the community? And could somebody like a Peggy Hubbard or a Dr. Ben Carson actually get the attention and possibly the support of more people in the black community?WILLIAMS: Well, you know, I don't know the answer to that. I don't know exactly who, but I know the numbers are incredible in terms of people who watched that video.But I'll tell you this: it makes an impact on me. Because it got to me. And then I -- and I think she's speaking truth. But I think it also gets to people who then want to put her down and say, ""Oh, she's just serving the white man or she's a conservative.""This is what ben Carson's talking about. Somebody comes out, takes a risky position, a stand, and Greg, she gets hammered by the black left.GUTFELD: Because -- well, the scariest thing to a white liberal is a black conservative. And when you see anything that steers away from those -- that ideology, it freaks people out.When you look at these activist groups, whether it is Black Lives Matter or occupy Wall Street or PETA, you're always going to get the idiotic fringe people in there, because there's no quality control. There's no standards in being an activist. It's not like going to med school where you need standards in order to actually save somebody's life. All you're doing is shouting. So there are some good people in these groups, but then there's some nuts.There's -- the old joke about a New York Times headline, no matter what it is, they always say ""minorities hit hardest."" So the earthquake strikes, minorities hit hardest. Hurricane, minorities hit hardest. Joblessness, minorities hit hardest.With radical politics, it's true. When there -- where there's radical politics, it is minorities and black communities that are hit hardest, because they're the most vulnerable. They can't leave their communities. They can't run from these activists. They're stuck there.And that's what's so painful, is that the gulf between their leadership and these people is so vast. Black communities are far more conservative than the activists who represent them.WILLIAMS: That's true.GUTFELD: But that's because all activists are radical. Not just black or white but all.WILLIAMS: And honest, let me just make one quick point and ask you, Kimberly, or Jesse, to respond. ""Straight Out of Compton,"" I think, is the No. 1 movie in America right now. And there are a lot of people who say all you're doing is celebrating thuggish, violent behavior.GUILFOYLE: Perpetuating that lifestyle.WILLIAMS: Even misogynistic behavior.GUILFOYLE: Perpetuating that lifestyle. But that's why -- I mean, it's a free market. OK? So they have every right to make that movie. But there should be a lot of discussion about the benefits and the -- you know, the bad outcomes of this, where people try and emulate this kind of thug life and thug behavior, which just fosters more violence.WILLIAMS: And I think it plays to white people who think, oh, that's the way they are.GUTFELD: But that's -- that's what the problem with that movie. The problem with that movie is that it's dishonest. It wasn't a political -- NWA wasn't a political group. They were capitalists. They were out to make money. And if the movie focused on that -- and also, it looked some of the more unsavory aspects of Dr. Dre's life, it would have been a better, honest film.WILLIAMS: It didn't include them?GUTFELD: It didn't. It didn't include them is my point.WILLIAMS: All right. Because we now have to be commercial and make some money. So next, suggestive signs targeting freshmen women at -- just got one fraternity suspended at a Virginia university, I'm trying to say. That's what's going on. So anyway, we're going to just come to that coming up.GUILFOYLE: That wasn't your fault. That was weird. Yes.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: All right. There's a lot of debate about whether college is a waste of time and money. Could this help settle it?The Daily Caller has put together a list of what it calls the dumbest college courses for 2015 at some of America's elite schools. Among them, ""Wasting Time on the Internet"" at U. Penn. According to the course manual, students will be required to stare at the screen for three hours. Aimless drifting is mandatory.And at Georgia State you can learn all about Kim Kardashian's husband if you take ""Kanye Versus Everybody.""GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.PERINO: Or at Occidental College there's a Stupidity Class, where you'll be studying ""Beavis and Butthead"" among others.So I've got to imagine, Kimberly, that if you're a mom and dad and you're saving for your child's college education, this isn't exactly the kind of course work you'd expect.GUILFOYLE: Isn't it sad? I mean, this is like open enrollment applauding for technical schools. If this is what you're going to get, is like going to college, ""Beavis and Butthead,"" basket weaving -- that was another one - - I mean, what a waste of time and money. I mean, you're just, like, turning your brain into sludge. I don't understand why they think it's good.PERINO: Aimless surfing of the Internet, Greg, is free.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: You don't really need to take a course for that.GUTFELD: You don't have to pay for that.GUILFOYLE: Terrible.GUTFELD: What -- what do these courses prepare you for? Only one thing, and that is to teach those courses.GUILFOYLE: ""Red Eye""?GUTFELD: Teach these courses, because you have no other skills.Cornell teaches tree climbing. Because once you realize none of the skills you learn will get you a job to pay rent, you're going have to live in a tree.GUILFOYLE: Right. Like the Robinson family or something.GUTFELD: But these aren't even the worst ones. The worst ones are the other pseudointellectual courses that fetishize gender and race, and deconstructionism. And they weave it all together, so it has nonsense masquerading as intelligence.Then when they shove these people out into the real world and go to a job interview, they have absolutely no common sense. Nothing they've learned will help them when they're trying to ask for a raise or trying to figure out a problem. But, you know, they deconstruct ""Moby Dick.""WILLIAMS: Really? You can help me figure out how to ask for a raise around here?WATTERS: Juan, you're very well-paid.GUILFOYLE: We all know.WILLIAMS: OK. OK.PERINO: Juan, did you take a look at your -- your children's courses that they chose? Like when they were going to college, did you look and check? Or no?WILLIAMS: Let me assure you. Let me assure you, they did not take any of this.But I will say this. Because we have a number of friends who are so critical, especially the black studies type thing. I think, you know, if you want to get an education, get an education. If it's rigorous, OK.But a lot of this seems to me to be frivolous and just kind of accentuating identity and racial politics...GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: ... in place of education.I will say this in defense, that my mom -- bless her soul -- used to say to me, ""So what kind of job does a philosophy major get? What are you doing?""GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: She couldn't understand that.GUTFELD: But a philosophy major is great. It's a great major.WATTERS: I was a philosophy major for a few years, and then I dropped out.WILLIAMS: There you go.GUTFELD: You dropped out of college?WATTERS: No. Just dropped that major. But listen.GUILFOYLE: Can't you tell?WATTERS: These people that take these courses, these are the people that show up in ""Watters' World."" I mean, that's what you get.PERINO: That's a good point.WATTERS: This is -- you'll end up in ""Watters' World"" if you major in tree climbing.GUILFOYLE: So they serve their purpose. You need them.WATTERS: Right. That's right. So keep taking the Kardashian class, and you're all set.But, you know, it's not brave to teach these courses. You're supposed to be a professor and try to, like, you know, bang kids' heads together. I came up with courses that I think they should take on campus. It kind of would rock the world.Economics. ""Why FOX News and Capitalism Save Lives."" I think that would be good. International relations. ""The World's Muslim Problem,"" taught by Greg Gutfeld. And women's studies, ""The Case for Male Dominance."" Taught by Keith Ablow. I think those courses right there, those would really provoke discussion on campus.GUILFOYLE: Crowd pleasers. Yes.PERINO: All right. Well, Jesse, when your daughters go to college, are you going to check their courses that they're taking?WATTERS: My parents signed me up for my freshman year of courses. And it was, like, the hardest courses. It was, like, English Lit, Greek. I got all ""F's"" first semester.GUILFOYLE: Are you serious?WATTERS: Yes. So I had to ease back after that.GUTFELD: There was an interesting -- I just thought of this when you were talking about the idea of how we -- how on campuses you propagate division. What the real solution is for courses is the opposite of division, which would be to teach or empathy or teach persuasion to your point of view. Because sooner or later, robots are going to be doing anything that doesn't require persuasion or empathy. That's the only skills that we will need.PERINO: You know what you should do?GUTFELD: What.PERINO: You join the speech team.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: Yes. And that's, in fact, what I did.GUILFOYLE: Really?WILLIAMS: But I think you're right. I wish I'd had you around to speak to my mother. Because I think that's what philosophy teaches you. Analytical, critical thinking.GUTFELD: That's right.PERINO: All right. We've got to go, because we've got one more thing to talk about. Things were finally looking up on Wall Street today until minutes before closing bell. And that's next on ""The Five.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: After yesterday's freefall on Wall Street, U.S. stock market rebounded and tumbled in the final minutes of trading today after China cut interest rates to boost its economy. The Dow closed down 205 points. The NASDAQ dropped 20, and the S&P fell 26.If you grabbed a coffee today at Starbucks and notice the staff being extra nice to you, that's because its CEO, Howard Schultz, asked them to be mindful of any stressed-out investors. In a note to employees, he wrote, quote, ""Our customers are likely to experience an increased level of anxiety and concern. Let's be very sensitive to the pressures our customers may be feeling and do everything we can do individually and collectively to exceed their expectations.""So I mean, first the CEO is telling everybody to initiate a race conversation. Now I guess this is better, probably. Wouldn't you want them to be nice to customers?GUTFELD: I find this hilarious. Because Howard -- so Howard Schultz is concerned about increased levels of anxiety of its customers, and he sells coffee! Coffee is the No. 1 causing...GUILFOYLE: It's a stimulant.GUTFELD: ... anxiety-driven beverage on the planet.GUILFOYLE: Heart palpitations.GUTFELD: There's nothing that gets you crazier than a cup of Starbucks coffee. In the stock market, it's really just a monetary version of caffeine. People watch it. They go up, or they go down. They go up or go down. It's hilarious. You should probably say don't drink coffee. Don't drink coffee today.WATTERS: If he really wanted to help investors, he would have maybe given a little discount on the coffee after everybody lost their -- everything in the kitchen sink yesterday and today.PERINO: Apparently, now Schultz is admitting that capitalists buy really overpriced coffee. And we need to be nice to them so that they keep buying overpriced coffee.WATTERS: That's true. Isn't this guy running for president? They floated his name when Hillary's server took a dive? And, you know, what's this guy? He's, like, trying to make headlines.GUILFOYLE: Anybody goes. I mean, I guess that's what it is. I mean, they do make delicious coffee. But -- and Greg is on the ""no coffee"" rule now.GUTFELD: No, I drink a lot of coffee.GUILFOYLE: No, but you're not supposed to drink coffee from 4 p.m. on before the show, because you have that problem.GUTFELD: Been there, done that.WILLIAMS: Yes, you talked about floating. Yes. See, a lot of floating when you drink coffee.WATTERS: That's true. Are you even a Starbucks guy? You don't look like you go into Starbucks. You look like a Dunkin' Donuts type of guy.WILLIAMS: I love Starbucks.GUTFELD: Is that a racial thing?GUILFOYLE: Yes. What was that?PERINO: What was that, Jesse?WATTERS: I think. Listen, Black Monday I thought was racist. I don't think they should call it Black Monday. I think it should be called White Monday.WILLIAMS: I must say, I'm interested that he's so concerned about the capitalists and the rich having a bad day. I wonder if he does this, like, you know, at the end of the month before the welfare checks come out. Does he do that?PERINO: Oh, Juan.WATTERS: Come on. Everyone's beating up on Starbucks. They have great coffee. I don't know what the problem is.PERINO: Actually, I think Juan was beating up on you.WATTERS: That's right. Well, I didn't feel it. He doesn't throw that hard of a punch.WILLIAMS: There you go.GUTFELD: They have great restaurant -- they have great restrooms.PERINO: Sometimes.WATTERS: That's true. That's true. All right. ""One More Thing"" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: All right. It's time now for ""One More Thing"" -- Juan.WILLIAMS: Here's a great quote to take to heart. Quote, ""Donald Trump rarely apologizes, although in this case he should. We have never been deterred by politicians or anyone else attacking us for doing our job,"" end quote. Those words from part of a statement our boss, FOX News chairman and CEO Roger Ailes, issued earlier today in response to Trump's repeated assaults on our colleague, Megyn Kelly.Trump has certainly been successful to this point in the GOP primaries. But if he hopes for that momentum to continue, he may want to focus on more serious issues facing this country.As for Megyn, her journalistic credentials speak for themselves. And all of us at this table and throughout FOX News are honored to call her a teammate and a friend.GUTFELD: Well done.GUILFOYLE: Indeed. Thank you, Juan. Dana.PERINO: All right. Constitution Day is September 17, and Constituting America is this great organization. It was founded by Janine Turner, and the cofounder is Cathy Gillespie. And they have a great contest. It's called We the Future. Anyone from kindergarten through college can submit a PSA, a public service announcement, or like a best song or short film, anything with a theme to do with the U.S. Constitution.Here's last year's winner. She did a PSA, Laura Lee Hicks. Just a piece of it. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LAURA LEE HICKS, WINNER OF CONTEST: If you have something, something that others wanted so badly but were denied it, something that you used and relied on every single day. If someone had given you a document that protected that something, wouldn't you take the time to read it?(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: So this is a great chance for you to talk about the Constitution, learn about the Constitution. Also last year the winners got to meet with Bret Baier. I mean, that's pretty cool. This year -- and Megyn -- I'm sorry, Monica Crowley and Sean Hannity are two of the supporters.Entries are due September 17. So for details, you just go to ConstitutingAmerica.org. Parents or teachers, if you're watching, this is a great organization. I encourage you to try to get involved.GUILFOYLE: Thank you, Dana.PERINO: You're welcome, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Gregory.GUTFELD: Yes, let's go to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Greg's Fashion Tips.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Oh, boy.GUTFELD: Now, when you are, like, at any kind of a museum or exhibition, try to dress the part. Here's a young man, a 12-year-old boy, actually, not a man. He's in Taiwan. He's walking down to look at a painting. Why don't you roll the tape?And he walks -- and he trips. And his fist goes into a $1.5 million painting of flowers. The kid's fine, by the way.I only say fashion tips, because I think he should have been wearing slacks and maybe some sneakers. He probably wouldn't have tripped if he was wearing maybe some loafers or something. And he wouldn't have fell.But anyway, he didn't get in trouble. He only spent four weeks in jail. No, he's good. He's good.PERINO: There's a big hole in the painting.GUTFELD: No, they fixed it.PERINO: I know. But still that's a big deal.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh. That was terrible. OK, Jesse.WATTERS: OK. Jon Stewart sill unemployed, can't get out of the limelight. Here he is seeking more attention.GUILFOYLE: What are you doing?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN CENA, PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER: You're going to understand this. Because right now I'm just going to do what I got to do.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, no. Oh, no. That's Jon Stewart.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: John Cena.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Put him down, John.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: With an -- of Jon Stewart.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So the funny man body slammed. You can call that a body. Just begging for attention. Can't just ride off into the sunset. Next season he will be on ""The Bachelorette.""PERINO: You're lucky that he doesn't have a show anymore.GUILFOYLE: I have one so super special. And these are K.G.'s fashion trips for Greg. He should try some of these outfits.Now look at this, a guy, 23-year-old writer from Mashable.com, was tasked with recreating Prince George's outfits for an entire week. These might even fit Greg. And that is in order to dissect what it was like to be a royal and, more specifically, a royal baby.Look at his little outfits. They are adorable. We could wear one every day on ""The Five."" It would be fantastic.GUTFELD: Got to have good legs.GUILFOYLE: All right. Set your DVRs so you never miss another episode of ""The Five."" That's it for us. ""Special Report"" is next.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 Roll Call, Inc.

IT IS FOX NEWS' POLICY THAT CONTRIBUTORS DISCLOSE POSITIONS THEY HOLD IN STOCKS THEY DISCUSS, THOUGH POSITIONS MAY CHANGE. READERS OF ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.RUSSIA'S PUTIN AND GERMANY'S MERKEL TOP PRES OBAMA ON NEW FORBES POWER LISTCarrie Sheffield:  This metric, is just one of many other things we can tick through an entire list.  When this president leaves office we're going to have 20 trillion dollars in our national debt.  We have Obamacare that's going to expand our deficits.  It's ironic also that the president said we're going to be pulling out of foreign entanglements like Afghanistan, etc.  in order to strengthen things here at home, that hasn't happened and investors are going to take note.John Tamny:  I think power when it comes to presidents is vastly overrated.  There's this belief out there that presidents create jobs and prosperity.  The reality is that we're the prosperity, we create the jobs.  A president that sits back and does nothing tends to see a lot of economic growth simply because he's getting out of the way.Mike Ozanian:  That's something Ronald Reagan knew very well and I bet you he'd be number one on this list because largely our economy would have been growing a lot faster and it would have been much stronger.  He also had the big defense buildup that made this country much safer. Elizabeth MacDonald: The president is notably downbeat constantly when it comes to talking about America.  He's said ""America is constantly dissatisfied with itself,"" that it's a ""self-critical experiment.""  Again this is a finger wagging, teacher's faculty outlook that the president has had about America. This idea of America and exceptionalism is centered in his own personal life experiences.  He's had a disregard for the moral purpose of America.  He's had a distain for it.  To legitimize Iran and try to make a terrorist rogue regime, as part of the new international world order and not speak up for Iranian students who were protesting against Iran and try to peacefully integrate Cuba who continues to attack the United States.  His outlook has basically legitimized our enemies, and people are really bad for world peace and undercut the US's moral efforts at peace.  Sabrina Schaeffer:  I'm absolutely concerned to see someone like Putin at the top of this list, and it makes you worried for our security and global security, at the same time, we have to see how a list like this evolves over the next year or two.  Part of what makes investors want to invest in the United States is not simply our president, it's also the kind of enterprise we have here.  Perhaps Uber should be at the top of a list like this, because that's where we're seeing real economic growth and change and that would be interesting to see.Bruce Japsen:  It said in this list that Putin is on top of this list because he does what he wants, and he gets away with it.  He has 86 percent support of his people.  In the President's case, in the first couple years of his term when he passed the healthcare law and he put a bullet in Bin Laden's eye, he had more support than Congress and he doesn't have that now.  Obama does not have a mandate like Putin does, and that goes to the power.  But we are still the richest country in the world and we're doing pretty well.TRUMP ACCUSES FED CHIEF OF PLAYING POLITICS WITH RATES; FUELS DEBATEMike Ozanian: Trump is spot on with his comments about the Fed.  The Fed's policies by keeping interest rates so long, has enabled Obama to borrow an unprecedented amount of money.  Allowed him to redistribute it with his entitlement programs and welfare programs, and it's really hurt the economy.  This is the worst recovery since the 1930s and we have the lowest percent of the labor force participating in the labor market that we've ever had. Bruce Japsen: This ranks up there with Trump's birth certificate quest of the president.  This is ridiculous here.  She's not raising rates because the economy is softer than people would like, and inflation is low.  But now with the jobs report out this week, I think that she'll probably raise rates in December just a little bit.  Trump will go back to whatever he's questioning out there.Sabrina Schaeffer: This is interesting because I have not been a huge Trump fan, but the more he starts hitting the nail on the head and I think what he's getting at whether you like his style or not, is that when you manipulate the interest rates, we distort the investment marking and that's something that's concerning.  So yes, maybe people aren't saving as much, money is going to some of those nonviable entities or it's going to government, that doesn't help us either.John Tamny: I think Trump's heart is in the right place, but he's predictably confused on this.  The Fed could no more stimulate the economy with rate machinations than Congress could stimulate the economy with government spending. Congress has no resources.  Neither does the Fed.  They can only weaken the economy by trying to manipulate it, so the Fed being active is weakening the Obama economy, it's not helping it. Elizabeth MacDonald: Getting back to the issue of Janet Yellen being political, if she raises rates, then she could say, no I'm not political.  They may raise rates in December a quarter point, not much.  She has given speeches in the past about income inequality, right before the midterm elections of 2014.  It should be noted that Janet Yellen was a chairperson of Clinton's council of economic advisers from 1997-1999.Carrie Sheffield: That's true as EMac said, on the inequality issues, she does politicize things, but I disagree with Trump on the issue of zero interest rates, because these interest rates were in place during the Bush administration.  This has to do with the soft economy.  Mike pointed out, this is a weak recovery.  We have an enormous jobs gap relative to other recoveries. REPORT: CHINA BURNING MORE COAL THAN PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSEDElizabeth MacDonald: China is joining these other nations saying essentially that we will not sign a climate change deal unless America and other developed countries pony up 100 billion each or whatever the number is.  China's carbon emissions have outstripped most of the developing world, over the last decade or so and they're a smaller economy.  China's only promising by 2030 to basically start curtailing carbon emission levels, but at what level will they be at by then? Bruce Japsen:  They're a big player, and we need to continue to engage them and be diplomatic about this.  We cannot just walk away from them, and not talk to them.  I think it's important that we continue to engage them and go through diplomacy and continue to do that path.  Mike Ozanian:  Look what's happened in Antarctica.  The Obama administrations for years was telling us the ice was melting, we're all doomed.  Now reports come out that there's actually more ice in Antarctica than there has been in the past.  Obama uses these scare tactics to increase regulation and increase taxes so he can funnel money to his friends who make solar panels, and punish the coal companies.  John Tamny:  Don't make the deals, but let's cheer on China.  Here's this once desperately poor country, that increasingly embracing the profit motive and it's people are using more and more of the world's resources. This is a great thing, not a bad thing, why make deals to shrink resource usage?Sabrina Schaeffer:   We just talked about why our power is slipping in the world, this is why.  It's embarrassing and I'm sure the Chinese are laughing at us.  The Clean Power Plan is requiring that the United States cut their emissions by 32 percent over the next 15 years at which point, they are supposed to start thinking about making changes and if they don't we have absolutely no recourse.  I think it's embarrassing, it makes us look foolish, that's exactly why we're losing powerful footing.  Carrie Sheffield:  All of China's figures are questionable.  Research from the American Enterprise Institute think-tank has shown this.  Whether it's their GDP figures, their emissions figures, they make ghost cities to make up that there are actually people living in places where they're not.  It's highly questionable.  The rule of law is not prevalent there so we really need to have a question mark over every deal. STOCK PICKSElizabeth MacDonald: Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI)Mike Ozanian: Vanguard (VSMGX)"

Delgado: Clinton is the 'dangerous, reckless' candidate; Gorka: Americans in more danger than they were before 9/11	"This is a rush transcript from ""Hannity,"" September 9, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST:  And welcome to ""Hannity.""  So Donald Trump -- he caps off another very good week on the campaign trail with a rally in the key swing state of Florida.  Here are some of those highlights.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  There are thousands of people outside that can't get in!(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP:  Fantastic.  Way to go.  Thank you.  Thank you, everybody.It is so great to be back in Florida, my second home.  You know it's my second home.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP:  Thank you.  Thousands of people outside cannot get in.  This is what's happening.  It's a movement like they have never seen before! Decades of political failure and corruption will come swiftly to an end, and a new American future will begin November 8th.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP:  The citizens of this country will be in charge once more, and it's about time!  The special interests have had their day.  That chapter in our history is closing.  We're going to bring back victory.  We're going to bring back common sense.  We're going to bring back something that the country has not had in a long, long time.  We're going to start winning again.The history book is closing on the failed politicians of yesterday.  A new chapter is beginning, and this chapter will be authored by you, the American people.  Not me, you.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP:  This will be your time.  You will be running the show.  This is a movement like they've never seen.  The show is beginning.  Hillary Clinton-- and you can see that from those e-mails...(BOOS)TRUMP:  ...is a very dishonest candidate of the past!  Ours is the campaign of the future.  In this future, we're going to pursue new trade policies that put American workers first, and we're going to keep our jobs in our country!  We're not going to let them take our jobs anymore, folks. We're not going to let it happen.It's been happening long enough.  And the reason they don't do anything about it is because the special interests and the donors control our politicians, and they control Hillary Clinton.  And it's never, ever going to happen.  Take a look at New York state.  When she was the senator from New York state, she campaigned by saying that she was going to bring jobs back to New York state.  New York state is a disaster!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Also this week, after whining about how the media is covering her campaign, Hillary Clinton actually held a press conference after, what, 280 days?  Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  No conversation about our national security would be complete unless we acknowledge that the nominee on the other side promises to do things that will make us less safe.  Every day that goes by, this just becomes more and more of a reality television show.  It's not -- it's not a serious presidential campaign.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Here with reaction, Trump campaign senior adviser A.J. Delgado, FOX News contributor Mercedes Schlapp, and former Clinton pollster, FOX News contributor Doug Schoen.A.J., I start with you.  It's interesting to watch that, you know, after Donald Trump goes to Baton Rouge and after Donald Trump has a pretty successful meeting with the Mexican president and after he has a good Value Voters Summit and after he also has a great town hall, looks like Hillary Clinton can't hide any longer.  Donald Trump's looking pretty presidential and a lot more energetic.A.J. DELGADO, TRUMP CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER:  Absolutely.  You know, what I find remarkable about that clip is she calls him reckless and dangerous. Sean, can we take a look at her foreign policy for a minute?Four prongs here.  Iraq -- Hillary was in favor of it.  Donald Trump was against it.  Check the Neil Cavuto interview from two months before the war.  Syria -- she wants us to establish a no-fly zone there.  You know what the problem with that is, Sean?  The Russians are already flying there, so that means military conflict, potential war with Russia.Libya -- she involved us in that, taking down Gadhafi.  Donald Trump at the time was critical of it.  Check his social media feed.  Russia -- while Trump is trying to be, and very much so presidential, diplomatic in extending the hand of not necessarily friendship, but engagement with a dialogue with Russia, just like Ronald Reagan did...HANNITY:  Let's look at...DELGADO:  ... these should be our allies in fighting ISIS, she wants us to have conflict with Russia.  Four reckless and dangerous positions on foreign policy...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  I mean, you know, Oh, sorry, I made a mistake.  I sent you to Iraq.  Oops.  We got to learn from it...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  ... 5,000 dead Americans.  We got to learn from it, and nobody died in Libya.  We got to learn from that, too.All right, let's look at some of the poll numbers.  Trump has had a good month now, Hillary under one ethical cloud after another, and it continues. Here's some interesting polling numbers, Doug Schoen.  If you look among Hispanics, African-Americans, just look at Trump's number, 19 percent, the black community.  He's doing outreach in Detroit.  I thought his speech one of the best he ever gave.  The Hispanic number, it's very strong.DOUG SCHOEN, FOX CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.HANNITY:  If he gets up to the 90 percent number, 92 percent with Republicans, and he holds these numbers, he's the next president.SCHOEN:  That is true.  The reason Hillary went out today -- and I thought she did a good job today.  She made it clear she disagrees with Trump about Putin.But the reason she's out is because she is sinking in the polls.  I put that in my Wall Street Journal article.  It's a fact.  She has to get out. She can't hide.  She started today, a good first step.  But Sean, this is a very close election.HANNITY:  All right, two press conferences in a week.  I mentioned the one earlier this week.  Now I mentioned the one today.  She's not exactly getting hard-hitting questions.Mercedes, we can look Quinnipiac.  All right, so it's 47-47 in Florida, no big surprise.  In one poll, in the Quinnipiac poll, she's up 47-43, but he's up 3 in another poll, so it's dead even, in North Carolina, 46-45 Trump in Ohio.  Look, it's a 5-point race in Pennsylvania, 5-point race in Michigan, 3-point race in Wisconsin.Hillary's got a lot of defending to do here, and more options seem to be opening up for Trump in terms of the electoral map if this continues, Mercedes.MERCEDES SCHLAPP, FOX CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, you know, again, Trump has been viewed as the underdog, right, Sean?  So then what has Hillary done? Hillary has spent her time on just a one-focus strategy, which is that saying Trump is dangerous.  That's not enough because what's happening is, is Trump is being very proactive.I mean, just this week, they outlined two separate messages.  The beginning of the week, it was national security, America first, with peace through strength, where you would have limited military engagement, as well as a strong military.  That's a very strong message.  And then at the end of the week, what was he talking about?  School choice, something that's a kitchen table issue.It draws in not only African-Americans that would be interested in this issue, Hispanics, but also women, which we saw in the last CNN poll that with married women, he's actually doing better than Hillary Clinton.  He's up 54 percent.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  ... she's got one ethical issue after another -- Clinton Foundation selling access, selling her soul.  And she's got this whole issue -- e-mail -- it does not go away!  E-mail might be the very reason she loses.But there's another reason.  She's not extremely principled.  Listen to Hillary flip-flopping on issues like immigration, and then I'll play her flip-flopping the Sunday after 9/11.  It's the 15th anniversary this Sunday.  The Sunday after 9/11, she was for racial profiling.So let's show Hillary Clinton in all of her flipping, flopping, flailing. She's like John Kerry voting for the $87 billion and then voting against it.  Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  I do not think that it is either appropriate to give a driver's license to someone who is here undocumented...QUESTION:  In 2007, you opposed giving driver's licenses to undocumented people.  Why?H. CLINTON:  Well, back then, it was a state-by-state determination, and I'm happy that most states have understood and moved in the right direction.QUESTION:  Are you going to crack down on the sanctuary states?H. CLINTON:  No, I'm not, and I'll tell you why.  I'm not.  I'm not because the reason why a lot of those folks do it -- in New York, why do police officers turn a blind eye?QUESTION:  Because they want them to report crimes.H. CLINTON:  They want them to report crimes.The city made a mistake not to deport someone that the federal government strongly felt should be deported.  So I have absolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted on.I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in.QUESTION:  You do want a wall, then?H. CLINTON:  No.  We've already...QUESTION:  You said that.H. CLINTON:  Well, I voted for border security, and some of it was a fence. I don't think we ever called it a wall.QUESTION:  Would illegal immigrants be covered under your plan?H. CLINTON:  Illegal immigrants would not be covered, no.  They would not be covered.  I want to open up the opportunity for immigrants to be able to buy into the exchanges under the Affordable Care Act.Everyone recognizes we have to tighten security.  We have to do whatever it takes to keep our people safe.QUESTION:  Including profiling, Senator?H. CLINTON:  Well, I think we have to do whatever it takes, Sam.  And I believe that -- you know, Tuesday changed everything.  Tuesday was a day that America has never, ever had to experience, and I hope to heaven that we never have to again.  But we are in a war situation, and we're going to have to do things that people do in times of war.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  She was wrong.  She did it.  Now, let's go through this.  She admitted this week her vote to send kids to Iraq was wrong.  Well, they died because of her decision!  Now she was for profiling, Doug.  She was for driver's licenses before she was against driver's licenses, for sanctuary cities, against sanctuary cities, for the wall, against the wall, coverage for health care for illegals, against coverage for health care.SCHOEN:  Right.HANNITY:  Then she said, I won't use the word illegal immigrants, even though she's used the word illegal immigrants.  Does she have any core at all, or is it just all political expediency?SCHOEN:  Look, I think what we're seeing here...HANNITY:  Is there a core?SCHOEN:  She is playing politics now because she...HANNITY:  She doesn't have a core!SCHOEN:  She has three states that matter.  That's what matters to her. That's her core, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania.  She is going to run a tough negative campaign on Trump because...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  Trump's a racist, sexist...SCHOEN:  I don't think he's a racist.HANNITY:  No, she's going to say it.SCHOEN:  And I think...HANNITY:  She'll say it!  Her campaign already is.SCHOEN:  ... (INAUDIBLE) a clear world view that is malleable.HANNITY:  Oh, so basically, she has no core, A.J.  She has no core!DELGADO:  Malleable?  Is that the word, Doug?HANNITY:  She stands for nothing!SCHOEN:  Malleable.DELGADO:  Good Lord.  How is that even the same person?  You watch that clip -- and by the way, she's lying.  I heard her say there, Well, I talked about a fence.  I never mentioned a wall.  That's a lie.  Look it up, 2006, New York Daily News interviews, she literally said the word ""wall,"" that a wall in some places would be appropriate.She's not only a flip-flopper, she lies about the flip-flopping!  This is insane.  How is she even qualified to run?  This shouldn't be allowed!HANNITY:  All right, Mercedes, you're going to get the last word here. We're running out of time.SCHLAPP:  There's a phrase in Spanish that A.J. will understand, ""Basta ia (ph),"" ""Enough already"" with Hillary Clinton, OK?(LAUGHTER)SCHLAPP:  For Hillary Clinton, it's all about political convenience, the same way it was convenient for her to use 15,000 Blackberries and iPads that were destroyed by a hammer.  I mean, let's get real, people!  And I think the American voter...HANNITY:  Don't forget BleachBit.SCHLAPP:  ... needs to wake up to this!HANNITY:  Don't forget BleachBit.  That's very important...SCHOEN:  ... $2 billion from the Clintons to make this all go away.HANNITY:  OK, like -- you mean like (INAUDIBLE) mean, like, with a cloth? No.  They used BleachBit so that God couldn't read it and Jesus couldn't read it.All right, good to see you all.SCHOEN:  Thank you.HANNITY:  Thank you.SCHOEN:  Thank you.HANNITY:  And coming up, Donald Trump on message, attacking Hillary Clinton with polls for the race for the White House now tightening.  RNC chairman Reince Priebus is here with reaction.Also, later tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  That message where -- I'll give you, America great again -- if you're a white Southerner, you know exactly what it means, don't you?(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Bill Clinton's suggesting that Trump's slogan, ""Make America great again,"" is racist.  Whoops!  One big problem.  He used the phrase over and over again.  Is he calling himself a racist?All of that, and actor Jon Voight will join us as we continue on this busy Friday on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  The politics of people like Hillary Clinton have produced only poverty, joblessness and rising crime.Hillary Clinton opposes school choice because she is controlled totally -- totally, like a puppet -- by special interests.It was the failed policies, you have to remember, of Hillary Clinton and Obama that unleashed ISIS in the first place.Unfortunately for our country, our enemies probably hacked into Hillary Clinton's e-mails.  These are the same e-mails she destroyed after receiving a federal subpoena.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Donald Trump going after his Democratic rival on multiple issues at the Values Voters Summit in Washington, D.C.Now, this tops off what has been yet another very bad week for Hillary Clinton.  After cracking under the pressure of some tough but fair questions during NBC's commander-in-chief forum, Clinton is now changing her strategy.  She's actually now talking to the press for the first time in 280 days.  Pretty amazing.Here now with reaction, RNC chairman Reince Priebus.  I'm looking at polls-- neck and neck in most of the swing states.  You look at the breakdown, you see Donald Trump is doing better among black Americans than the last eight Republican presidential candidates, among independents, crushing Hillary Clinton.  Hispanics, he's doing very well.You know where he's doing poorly?  With the Republicans.  He's getting about 73, 74, or 75 percent of Republicans.  He needs 90 percent.Now, you've got opposition from The Wall Street Journal, NRO, Jonah Goldberg, the Glenn Becks of the world, the Mitt Romney team in total, and some four presidential candidates that signed a pledge for you -- Kasich, Bush, Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz.I'm a little pissed off at all these people because they're helping Hillary.  Are you mad?REINCE PRIEBUS, RNC CHAIRMAN:  Well, yes, of course.  I mean, they're absolutely helping Hillary.  If you're not voting for Donald Trump, you're basically voting for Hillary Clinton.And look, you're right.  It was a pledge, and it wasn't just a pledge.  In some cases, it was a data exchange agreement, where the candidates received valuable data and information, and in exchange for that information, they agreed to support the nominee, whomever he or she was.And so I think they should honor the pledges, and I think that our state chairmen and our committee people on the committee are going to review this situation, and there may be consequences in the future.But look, I saw some polling that should give you a much better feeling about this.  This CNN poll came out this week, had a much higher percentage of Republican support for Donald Trump.  But look...HANNITY:  What was the percentage of that poll?(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  What was the percentage in that poll?PRIEBUS:  It was in the high 80s.  So I mean...HANNITY:  He needs 92.  If he gets to 92...(CROSSTALK)PRIEBUS:  ... going to get there.  I think by the time we get to November, Sean, I think he's going to get there, especially if he continues down this path that he's on.  I think everybody is very pleased with what he's been doing.HANNITY:  Baton Rouge, Mexico.  I thought his speech in particular in Detroit was strong, Value Voters Summit today.PRIEBUS:  I think he did very well -- he did very well in the forum the other day, the military forum.  He won easily.  He did a great job. Hillary Clinton was very, very defensive, and she was upset because she couldn't believe that she...HANNITY:  You know -- you know Trump won when the media...PRIEBUS:  ... had to stand there and...HANNITY:  ... the liberals in the media are blasting poor Matt Lauer.  I mean, I'm not a fan of Lauer's, but...PRIEBUS:  Well, that was -- but -- but that was also Hillary Clinton's campaign.  I mean, the reason she was so fiery (ph) Matt, it wasn't because they were serious issues, like she claims -- they were serious issues, but she was beyond upset because she couldn't believe that she had to stand there for 11 minutes and answer questions about something she did to herself.And when that Air Force corpsman stood up and said, I would be in prison if I did what you did, her team and her surrogates went after Matt Lauer and NBC all night and the next day.  You know, look it, this is what Republicans...HANNITY:  Let me ask you this...PRIEBUS:  We deal with a double standard every single day...HANNITY:  All agreed.PRIEBUS:  ... of our lives in the media.  Now, this wasn't a double standard.  She had what she had coming, and she's going to answer more tough questions like that in the future.HANNITY:  I agree.  But how could Matt Lauer not ask about the e-mails?  I mean, it's ridiculous.  She's been ducking and dodging and hiding, you know, more than anybody.  All right, Reince, good to see you.PRIEBUS:  You bet.HANNITY:  Sixty days to go.  No pressure on you.  You better do your job.PRIEBUS:  You bet.HANNITY:  All right, thank you.And coming up next tonight on ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  That message where -- I'll give you America great again, is -- if you're a white Southerner, you know exactly what it means, don't you?(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Bill Clinton playing the race card, insinuating Donald Trump's campaign slogan is racist.  Well, sorry, Bill, but we have video of you using the exact same phrase over and over and over and over again.Plus, Chelsea Clinton calls out Donald Trump's rhetoric, saying he's misogynistic and sexist.  Chelsea, you really want to go there?  We got a lot to say about your father.  OK, you open the debate.  We'll do it.Plus, Hollywood A-lister Jon Voight introduced Donald Trump at the Value Voters Summit earlier today.  He'll join us and more straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL CLINTON:  I'm actually old enough to remember the good old days, and they weren't all that good in many ways.  That message, where -- I'll give you America great again, is -- if you're a white Southerner, you know exactly what it means, don't you?(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)B. CLINTON:  What it means is, I'll give you the economy you had 50 years ago, and I'll move you back up on the social totem pole and other people down.  What Hillary wants to do is take the totem pole down and let us all go forward together!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  That was former president Bill Clinton earlier this week implying that Donald Trump's slogan, ""Make America great again,"" is racist.  Now, it's funny that Bill thinks that because it's a phrase that he used years ago over and over and over.  I used it over and over again in front of all those hot chicks on the campaign trail.  Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)B. CLINTON:  I believe that together, we can make America great again.I want to attack these problems and make America great again.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Paid for by Clinton for president.B. CLINTON:  And now you are being called upon, every one of you, to secure a better future for your children and your grandchildren and to make America great again economically, educationally and socially.It's time for another comeback, time to make America great again.  I know Hillary's the one who can do it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Paid for by Hillary Clinton for president.H. CLINTON:  I'm Hillary Clinton, candidate for president, and I approved this message.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  All right, joining us now with reaction, CEO for the National Diversity Coalition for Donald Trump, Reverend Darrell Scott, from The Hill-- newspaper, of course -- Joe Concha -- on line, you can find it there -- FOX News contributor Deneen Borelli.Pastor Scott, by Bill Clinton's own definition, he's a racist!REV. DARRELL SCOTT, TRUMP SUPPORTER:  Yes.  I mean, you know, here's ""Slick Willy.""(LAUGHTER)SCOTT:  He's the pot calling the kettle black.  This is the same guy that belonged to two white-only country clubs in the '90s, the same guy who fought to retain the Confederate flag.  But watch this.  By his own definition, he's a racist.  This is a guy that doesn't know what the definition of sex is!  I didn't have sex with that woman.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  ... he said, We white Southerners know.  So he used a phrase that white Southerners knew back when he was running, so...SCOTT:  Right.HANNITY:  ... based on his -- all right, and here's what gets interesting, Deneen, is J. William Fulbright Bill Clinton cites as his mentor, a known segregationist.  Hillary Clinton's mentor is a guy by the name of Robert ""Ku Klux Klan"" Byrd, former mentor...DENEEN BORELLI, FOX CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.HANNITY:  ... her mentor!BORELLI:  Yes, it's interesting that Bill Clinton is using this language, who justifies Robert Byrd being a Klansman, and Hillary, yes, she thought Byrd was a mentor to her.But listen, the Clinton campaign is getting very desperate right now. They're going to play every card they possibly can, the race card, the woman card, the Russian card.  They are concerned that Donald Trump's message is resonating with black voters, his message of empowerment, school choice, pro-energy, pro-economic policies -- they are concerned about that. And anytime they play the race card, it's a sign of desperation.HANNITY:  Yes, I agree with you.  Joe, this is a certain timing to all of this.  Let me play Chelsea Clinton talking about Donald Trump being a misogynist and a sexist.  And I'm, like, Chelsea, really?  Your dad -- you want to go there?  OK, let's play the game.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)QUESTION:  What's your response to Donald Trump saying your mom does not look presidential?CHELSEA CLINTON, DAUGHTER OF BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON:  Where to begin?  Or maybe just I would hope that everyone could see that as the sad, misogynistic, sexist rhetoric that I hoped we had moved beyond in the 21st century, certainly in 2016.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Timing is interesting to me.  I want to get your observation on this, Joe.  All right, so the timing is that Hillary Clinton under fire, Clinton Foundation, 55 percent, the AP reports, of those meetings that she had with individuals are either donors or people pledging money.Now we've got Hillary under fire all week, more e-mail problems, one after another.  You got Chelsea playing the sex card, the gender card, and you got Bill playing the race card.Is there -- is this a coincidence, or is this designed to divert attention?JOE CONCHA, THE HILL:  I think they're running out of cards at this point, right?  I mean, how many cards can you play?  Look, the bottom line is that the Clintons led by -- or Hillary Clinton -- by 8 points in the RealClearPolitics average just four weeks ago.  Donald Trump has won every week since then, and now it's a virtual dead heat.  And the swing states are going in that direction, as well.So I don't think it's any coincidence, Sean, that these cards are being played when Hillary Clinton has lost momentum, clearly, and used the sexist card.  They used it against Matt Lauer, as well.  They said Matt Lauer kept interrupting Hillary on Wednesday -- because she was filibustering!HANNITY:  Well, actually, I went back and looked.  If you look closely, Donald Trump was interrupted more aggressively 13 times, Hillary only six or seven times.CONCHA:  And Donald Trump got more questions.  And by the way, the whole thing...HANNITY:  Twice as many questions.CONCHA:  ... about Bill Clinton saying that ""Make America great"" again -- obviously, he used it.  Obviously, Donald Trump is using it.  Somebody else used it, as well...HANNITY:  Ronald Reagan used it.CONCHA:  ... Ronald Reagan in 1980...HANNITY:  Show the poster.  I love the poster you brought.CONCHA:  OK, go to the Google machine and you can see, Reagan, make America great again...(CROSSTALK)CONCHA:  ... in 1980, so...HANNITY:  By the way, he did make America great again.  He succeeded.CONCHA:  And wasn't a racist.BORELLI:  (INAUDIBLE) Sean, Bill Clinton is mocking people in coal country, Kentucky and West Virginia...HANNITY:  I know.  I saw that.BORELLI:  ... just because they're -- they don't -- they're not in line with the progressive policies.  And so Bill Clinton has no use for them, and he's mocking these people?  It's unbelievable!HANNITY:  Guys, good to see you all.  Thank you for being with us.Coming up -- Donald Trump addressed the Values Voters Summit.  Hollywood legend Jon Voight introduced Trump.  He'll join us coming up next with reaction, along with Jerry Falwell, Jr., and Pastor Robert Jeffress.And then later, Sunday marks the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attack.  Have we gone back to a pre-9/11 mindset?  We'll get to that with Dr. Sebastian Gorka and much more tonight here on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: Donald Trump spoke to conservatives at the Value Voter Summit in Washington, D.C. this week.  Here are some of the highlights.TRUMP:  Our media culture often mocks and demeans people of faith, and you understand that.  Your values of love, charity, and faith built this nation.  Our politicians have really abandoned you to a large extent.  So, let me state this right up front, a Trump administration, our Christian heritage will be cherished, protected, defended like you've never seen before.HANNITY:  Joining us now, legendary Hollywood actor Jon Voight.  He introduced Donald Trump at the summit today.  A good friend of mine, and I'm also a fan of his.  How are you, sir?  Good to see you, my friend.JON VOIGHT, HOLLYWOOD ACTOR:  I'm great, Sean.  It's good to be with you.HANNITY:  You know, what he said today, I really have been critical of Obama, who's unwilling to say the words radical Islam.  But worse than that-VOIGHT:  Yes, of course.HANNITY:  -- he said the terrible deeds done in the name of Christ and talked about the crusades.  And I listened to Donald Trump there, and he said, ""Yeah, Christians have been mocked and demeaned.  And those qualities of love, charity, and faith, they did build this nation.""  Obama doesn't seem -VOIGHT:  You bet.HANNITY:  -- to want to say those things, to me.VOIGHT:  Yes.  Well, I think he's got other agendas, of course.  But the people, you know, there are Christian people throughout the world have been attacked, and we've been attacked right here in this country in many ways. And so, the reception for Donald Trump here has been quite extraordinary.HANNITY:  You know, I -VOIGHT:  And his speech was wonderful.  By the way, I - you know, his speech was wonderful.  I wish that people could listen to the whole speech. It was a quite extraordinary speech, and people were standing throughout the entire speech here.HANNITY:  Yeah, we actually ran it on Fox earlier today.  And I know it's on foxnews.com if people haven't seen it, they have an opportunity to see it.  You were very outspoken early on, and you said that you believe that Donald Trump would be a very good president.  I agree with you.VOIGHT:  Yes.HANNITY:  And there are some Republicans that seem to be putting their heads in the sand and not comparing Trump's position on Supreme Court justices, and his position on vetting refugees and securing our borders and eliminating ObamaCare and energy independence and education back to the states.VOIGHT:  Yeah.HANNITY:  Why do you think there is this mysterious reluctance among some, ""arrogant"" the intelligentsia as they consider themselves in the Republican Party?VOIGHT:  Well, you know, there's a lot of good people among them.  But, you know, when people start - early on, when he had a little bit of a roughness about his speech and stuff, and he's not too smooth, he's not slick, but he's completely honest.  But early on, they chose other people, and they built their own arguments against Donald Trump.  And they were so in love with their own arguments, they couldn't let them go, and they still hold on to them a little bit sometimes.  But I think coming toward this election, they're going to realize the stakes, and you repeat them every night to people.  You make that list of the important things that they should be thinking about.  And I think there's going to be a unity coming on November 8th.HANNITY:  Yeah, I hope so.  You know, you're one of Hollywood's biggest actors.  You're one of my favorite actors even before I knew you.  And you have no fear at all.  You've never had any fear expressing your strongly and deeply held political beliefs.  Have you paid a price at all for that?VOIGHT:  Well, you know, you never know what goes on behind closed doors. But I've been very fortunate to have, you know, roles offered me all through my career.  I've been very, very lucky.  And I think that there are more - you know, there are more conservatives in Hollywood than one would think in all echelons, even among the actors.  But they kind of keep their heads down a little bit because there's an awful lot of real hatred coming from the left, unfortunately, and they're very outspoken.  So, we have that little difficulty, but look, I was on the left one time, and I always think, you know, the problem is information.  If they get some of the facts, maybe they can turn around.  So, I'm really always open to talk to anybody.HANNITY:  Yeah.  Did you get to spend time with Trump?  Is there a part of him that you know that you want to share with people that maybe don't have the opportunity to see him behind the scenes as I do and as you do?VOIGHT:  I'll tell you one thing that I - I just saw him just for a little bit.  But, you know, he was very moved by the whole evening.  And coming off the stage, he was very moved by it and very grateful to me.  And, you know, he is - he is a very considerate - he's a very considerate guy.  He goes to the guys who run the - you know, run the machinery for his, you know, his teleprompter, and he always gives them a little pat and stuff like that, but it's very sincere.  He's got a lot of compassion.  He cares about people, and his speeches are starting to reflect that, too.HANNITY:  Yeah, and I've seen - I've had the same experience.  He always says hi to my crew and the people that work with us and the camera guys and the producers and directors.  Jon Voight, it's been a while.  Good to see you.  Thanks for coming back.VOIGHT:  Great, Sean.  God bless.HANNITY:  God bless.  And joining us now with reaction, the president of Liberty University, Jerry Falwell, Jr., Fox News contributor, Dr. Robert Jeffress.  Dr. Falwell, you said from day one, I - we're not electing a pastor-in-chief, we are electing a president of the United States, a commander-in-chief.  That was a -DR. JERRY FALWELL, JR., PRESIDENT OF LIBERTY UNIVERSITY:  That's right.HANNITY:  -- pretty connecting speech for people of faith today as I watched it.  One that I think your father would be proud of.FALWELL:  I agree. I think - very proud.  And I think he hit all of the major issues that are important to people of faith, the Johnson Amendment, the - you know, that's very important to us, and, you know, to the university where I work because so many liberal universities, Ivy League Universities, left-wing ideology is so pervasive that they pretty much are democrat voter indoctrination camps.  It was in the news today that a major university, the professor was using the e-mail list of the school to promote Hillary Clinton, and you never see left-wing schools ever tagged by this Johnson Amendment.  It's always conservative churches, conservative schools.  In 2008, I endorsed Mike Huckabee personally, and Americans United for Separation of Church and State filed a complaint against Liberty University, because I endorsed Mike Huckabee.  And we had to - we had to go through all of that process, and we actually filed a complaint against them for violating their own 501(c )(3) status by only going after and filing complaints against conservative universities and churches.  And so, they never bothered us again after that.  But there's so many churches and schools, conservative schools that are - that are - it's a chilling effect on them.  They're in silence because they're afraid of what's going to happen to them.HANNITY:  You know, and this is important, but I don't think most people even know what you're talking about with the Johnson Amendment.  Why don't you explain what that is?FALWELL:  It's a 1954 amendment that was attached to a bill in congress. It was signed by the president at the time, and it basically said no non- profit organization, no university, no church can endorse or oppose a candidate.  And so, since that time, though, it's - there's only been complaints filed against conservative churches and schools.HANNITY:  Not liberal ones.FALWELL:  And there's a group called (INAUDIBLE) this - a former New York mayor Bloomberg spoke at Harvard in 2014 for their commencement, and he chastised the Ivy League because 96 percent of their faculty and staff donated to the Obama administration.  Many of their speakers were disinvited because they were conservatives, and they were denied an honorary degree, like the one you received at Liberty once, Sean.  And so, that - it's just very telling that this Johnson Amendment is only used against conservatives.  They're the only ones -HANNITY:  Well said.FALWELL:  -- that feel intimidated.  The liberal schools -HANNITY:  And they should have freedom of speech like everybody else, so every individual.FALWELL:  Exactly.HANNITY:  Dr. Jeffress, did Donald Trump make inroads with the evangelical and faith community today?DR. ROBERT JEFFRESS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  He certainly did, Sean, because he spoke about the issue that not only resonated today, but it's resonating with evangelicals everywhere, and that's the appointment of conservative Supreme Court justices.  Trump has made a commitment that he's going to appoint justices who interpret the law using the constitution rather than political correctness as the standard.  And, you know, Sean, the issues many of us evangelicals care about, religious liberty and the sanctity of life -HANNITY:  This will impact -JEFFRES: -- performed to be determined by the Supreme Court.  And let me just say - yes?HANNITY:  Dr. Jeffress, this will impact this country for generations. That one issue alone ought to be a game-changer for anyone that says they are a conservative.  That one should be enough.JEFFRESS:  Let me just say, I agree.  I agree.  And that's why I am getting sick and tired of these namby-pamby-wasted weakling Christians who say they're going to stay at home in November out of moral principle.  Will you please tell me what right moral principle there is in the universe that would allow a prohibition, anti-religious liberty candidate like Hillary Clinton to become the president?  I believe any conservative Christian who refuses to vote or throws away his vote in November is nothing but a hypocrite and a fool.HANNITY:  Wow.  All right, guys.  Good to see you both.  Appreciate your time.FALWELL:  And, Sean?HANNITY:  Yeah.FALWELL:  The vouchers is very important.  I was so glad to hear that he mentioned that because that's how the teachers unions and the Democratic Party have kept minorities down, kept them from getting the education they need to succeed.  If you bring jobs back to the United States, you've got to re-educate the populace, so I'm so glad he mentioned vouchers.HANNITY:  We're destroying all that God-given talent with a horrible educational system.  Guys, good to see you both.  Coming up, while Americans prepare to remember the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attack, the threat posed by ISIS, radical Islam is growing both here and abroad.  Dr. Sebastian Gorka is going to react to the question, ""Have we gone back to a pre-9/11 mentality?""  Straight ahead.(END VIDEOTAPE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY:  Welcome back to ""Hannity."" Now, this Sunday marks the 15th anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks.  Now, while it's important to remember those who are lost and never forget, America needs to remain vigilant.  Especially in the fight against radical Islamic terror, but - because this threat around the globe, and right here in our homeland is growing.  According to the FBI, there are ISIS-related cases now in all50 states.  That includes 1,000 active investigations in this country alone.  Now, since 2014, over 105 people have been charged under federal law in ISIS-related cases.  Seven of those have been convicted.  And in the same timeframe, there have been 30 ISIS-linked plots to attack this country.  Here with reaction, the author of ""Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War,"" Dr. Sebastian Gorka.  If we have a president and a presidential candidate that can't say Radical Islamic and we got Chattanooga, and we've got Fort Hood, and we've got San Bernardino, and we've got Orlando, and we've got Belgium, and we've got Sweden, and we've got Paris and Paris and Paris and Germany, and all - you know, all over the world, have we learned anything?  Have we gone back to what the 9/11 commission report said as they were at war with us, we're not at war with them.  I don't think you can be at war with somebody if you can't identify them.DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA, NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST AND TERRORISM EXPERT: You're absolutely right.  The (INAUDIBLE) said, ""You have to know yourself. You have to know the enemy if you want to win your war.""  Americans today, Sean, the sad fact is are in greater danger than they were the day before September 11th, 2001.  You've given the statistics.  ISIS cases in every state.  We have just recently arrested the 110th ISIS supporter in America, in Roanoke, Virginia.  If you look at the facts on the ground, it's the same everywhere.  The NCTC, the National Counter-Terrorism Center which works for President Obama's director of national intelligence, just briefed him and said there are ISIS affiliates today in 18 nations around the world.  Two years ago, it was seven, Sean.  It is now more than double that.  The threat has increased.HANNITY:  You know, let's say that we're right.  And I pray to God we're wrong, that we have a pre-9/11 mind-set.  Let's say it's the aftermath and the next 9/11 commission comes together.  Are they going to talk about misidentifying Fort Food, euphemisms, man-caused disasters, overseas contingencies, workplace violence, are they going to mention giving $150 billion to the number one state sponsor of terror?  Are they going to mention precipitously pulling out of Iraq and not following through in Syria, and creating a vacuum for ISIS to emerge?  Are they going to mention all those things?  In other words, can I write the story ahead of time that we set the stage for our own next big attack that kills thousands?GORKA:  I think, Sean, that's only going to happen, we're only going to grasp the nettle of reality if we have men with a back bone, if we have leaders, if we have men or women politicians who have a spine, because it takes that to defeat your enemy.  In World War II it was the same, under President Reagan during the Cold War, we spoke truthfully about the enemy. We called them evil and we saw them as a totalitarian threat.  Well, guess what, the Jihadis are just the same, whether you're a communist or a fascist, you are an existential threat to America, and it's the same with Jihadis.HANNITY:  And it is evil.  Let's be clear.  This is evil.GORKA:  It's evil.  Yes.HANNITY:  Radical Islamic terrorism is evil in our time.  ISIS is evil.GORKA:  True.HANNITY:  Radical Islamist are evil.  Why is it so hard for them to say that?GORKA:  Because they don't believe in objective truth.  They're post- secular modernists.  They believe in cultural relativism or cultures are equal except America, which is worse than everybody else.  That's the thing, Sean.HANNITY:  Yeah.GORKA:  We remember the apology tour, right?HANNITY:  A good point.  A very good - well, talk about terrible deeds in the name of Christ, he does do that -GORKA:  Which happened when?  Which happened when?HANNITY:  Well, he's talking about the crusades, which were Christians -GORKA:  Right.HANNITY:  -- fighting for lands that were taken by radical Islamist of their time.GORKA:  Right.  And - but we're talking about Islamic terrorism now.  Being crucified, burnt alive as we speak.HANNITY:  And beheaded now.GORKA:  And be headed.HANNITY:  Right?  Yeah.GORKA:  Yeah.HANNITY:  All right.  And by the way, women being tortured and oppressed.GORKA:  Enslaved.HANNITY:  Gays and lesbians being killed, Hillary takes money from those countries, Christians and Jews persecuted.  Thank you, Dr. GORKA.GORKA:  Thank you.HANNITY:  Coming up, we need your help.  A very important question of the day, straight ahead.(END VIDEOTAPE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY:  Welcome back to ""Hannity."" Time for our ""Question of the Day.""  Has America - this is an important question - come back to a pre-9/11 mind-set? Sadly, I hope I'm dead wrong.  But I believe we have.  What do you think? Go to facebook.com/seanhannity, @seanhannity on Twitter, let us know what you think.  That's all the time we have left this weekend, for today.  Have a great weekend.  57 days, Monday, until Election Day.  Buckle up.  It's going to be a great ride.  We'll continue on Monday.

9	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/07/07/bill-oreilly-vilification-donald-trump-over-illegal-immigration/	Bill O'Reilly: The vilification of Donald Trump over illegal immigration	"Does the truth hurt? Or did Mr. Trump unfairly malign Mexico and millions of Mexican illegal aliens. ""Talking Points"" will now answer those question.The primary mistake Donald Trump made in his campaign kickoff speech was speaking too generally about the border problem. Most Mexicans who sneak into the U.S.A., or overstay their legal visitation status do so because they are economically deprived. They are largely undereducated folks trying to feed their families. Also, the vast majority of illegal aliens do not -- do not commit crimes while on American soil, apart from their immigration offenses.But there are very big problems stemming from Mexican illegal immigration and the stats tell the truth. As we all know, Mexico is the major supplier of illegal drugs into the U.S.A. The drug cartels down there have corrupted the police and many politicians. They are brutal thugs who commit mass murder, torture, and generally shame their nation.ISIS has nothing on these drug cartels. They are both savage enterprises. The government of Mexico not capable of defeating the drug lords and the government down there rejects direct American intervention. U.S. drug agents, for example, are not allowed to carry firearms in Mexico, thereby putting themselves at great risk assisting Mexican authorities. For decades Mexico City has allowed organized crime to brutalize its own people and Americans as well. Some of the drug organizations have branched out now into people smuggling. Charging money to get desperate migrants across the border. In the process many, perhaps most, migrant women are sexually molested.And that was the rape situation Donald Trump mentioned. But it's not ordinary Mexicans doing the raping, it's the gangsters. And Trump should have made that clear. The truth is there's little supervision on the Mexican side of the border. Cities like Juarez and Nuevo Laredo literally run by the drug cartels. Border security in Mexico nonexistent and has been for decades. That situation is not going to improve.So, Trump is correct in saying that only a massive wall will stop the chaos and even then drugs and people will get through although not to the extent they do now. Washington knows all this but has turned away from securing the border ever since President Reagan promised to do that after he signed an immigration amnesty in 1986.Mr. Reagan did not keep his promise. And every single president since has failed to secure the southern border -- every one.Now, what about the immigrants themselves? 59 percent of Mexican residents and illegal aliens have less than a high school education. Only 4 percent have a college degree. 68 percent are poor or near poor. 57 percent receive means tested welfare of some kind paid for by the American taxpayer. 56 percent do not have health insurance, many of those receiving Obamacare subsidies.So Trump's analysis is correct. The majority of Mexicans coming from the U.S.A. are not achievers in the economic sense. To be fair, that was the case with the Irish, Italian, and European immigration waves of the past. Hard working people coming here to try to improve themselves.But, here is the dangerous part now. According to government statistics, 71 percent of non-American citizens in federal prisons are from Mexico, Columbian nationals second just 4 percent. Mexican criminals represent a whopping 16 percent of all convicts serving time in federal penitentiaries. That's a huge burden on the American taxpayer and a dangerous situation for we, the people.Like 32-year-old Kate Steinle. Last Wednesday, Kate was walking with her father in San Francisco enjoying the evening when she was shot dead on the street for absolutely no reason at all. Police say 45-year-old Francisco Lopez Sanchez an illegal alien from Mexico murdered Kate. Apparently Sanchez has seven felony convictions, has been deported five times. Yet, he is still walking around the streets of San Francisco, this guy.That's because Mayor Ed Lee and the 11 members of the San Francisco city supervisors refuse to cooperate with the federal government on criminal aliens. The feds asked the city of San Francisco to keep Sanchez in custody. The city refused. Miss Steinle paid for that irresponsible and unconstitutional decision with her life.San Francisco is a sanctuary city and proud of it. And violent crimes committed by criminal aliens have happened there before. City authorities refuse to say how many because they know it's a huge scandal, a black mark on the history of San Francisco -- the most tolerant of cities.The family of Kate Steinle asking for calm, not vengeance. But ""Talking Points"" is not as charitable.In 1996, president bill Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act which stipulated that local and state authorities were to cooperate with the feds in apprehending illegal aliens, especially criminals.In 2007, then Mayor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order stating that as a sanctuary city San Francisco would not, would not cooperate with federal authorities on illegal immigration matters and would protect even criminal aliens. The feds did nothing.In 2010, the Obama administration open lid -- openly said it would not punish cities that refused to obey the 1996 immigration law.So here's the deal. Here's the deal. The mayor and city supervisors of San Francisco are directly responsible for the murder of Kate Steinle and the Obama administration is complicit. Attorney General Loretta Lynch could order the FBI today to arrest Mayor Lee and the supervisors for violating federal law. She is within her authority to do that.I know that's not going to happen because racial politics drives the law these days which is why Trump caught so much hell. The constitution demands that the federal government protect Americans from foreign intruders, demands it. Obviously that responsibility is not being met. And if you point that out as Trump did, you're a racist, a pinata for the open border crowd to bash.The fact that a felon could be deported five times and still be walking around San Francisco should shame Congress, shame it. Where is a law that says if you are deported one time and come back, you serve five years in prison? Where is that law? Congress should pass it. And if President Obama doesn't sign it, everything will be on the table. It will be on him.That legislation should be called the Kate law. Much like Jessica's law. So who will sponsor this? Who will sponsor the new law? Who will do it? Please let me know directly. We are looking for some legislators in Washington who have courage. Are you out there? Are you out there?""Talking Points"" is disgusted with the cowardice of our elected officials from the crazy left San Francisco people to the President to the Congress. Most of them are rich folks who could not care less about the violence and chaos, out-of-control criminal activity south of the border is creating in this country. If Mexico does not crack down hard on border intrusions and drug trafficking, we should punish them economically, punish them -- period.This entire disaster has been going on for far too long. The excuse that America is at fault because we use drugs and secure our side of the border is valid. We are at fault. That does not excuse Mexico's rampant corruption and abuse of its own people. Drug and people smuggling injure millions and cost lives. It's the dirtiest of crimes.Finally the poor people sneaking in here to paint your house are not the problem. They're not the problem. The cowardly politicians who will not uphold the law and the constitution are the problem. That's what Donald Trump should have said.And that's ""The Memo"".Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years.
