This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" October 5, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Eric Bolling and a Pixy Stix is her javelin, Dana Perino, ""The Five."" So, what an orderly debate.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TIM KAINE, (D) VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: You both have said -- you both have said that Vladimir Putin is a better leader than the president.GOV. MIKE PENCE, (R) VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Well --(CROSSTALK)ELAINE QUIJANO, DEBATE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, we are going to get to Russia in just a moment. But I do want to get back to the question at hand.PENCE: But in the midst, in the midst, yeah -- Elaine, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.KAINE: But Elaine --PENCE: Thank you, Senator, I'll --KAINE: These guys have praised .PENCE: Yes.KAINE: . Vladimir Putin as a great leader.QUIJANO: Yes, and we will get to that Senator --KAINE: How can they defend that?PENCE: Yeah.KAINE: OK.QUIJANO: We do have that coming up here. But in the meantime, the questions --(CROSSTALK)PENCE: Well, Senator, I must have hit a --QUIJANO: . your running mate?PENCE: Yeah, I must hit a nerve here.QUIJANO: And why the disconnect with your running mate?KAINE: But why won't he release his tax returns?PENCE: Well, we're answering the question about, about the business thing, is he --KAINE: I do want to come back to that, but --QUIJANO: Gentlemen, I need to ask you about .PENCE: He's going to release his tax returns when the audit .QUIJANO: . social security.PENCE: . is over --KAINE: Richard .(CROSSTALK)KAINE: Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit.PENCE: They're going to raise your taxes.QUIJANO: Gentlemen .(CROSSTALK)QUIJANO: Gentlemen .KAINE: If you can't meet Nixon's standard --QUIJANO: Gentlemen, the people at home cannot understand .KAINE: People have a lot of --QUIJANO: . either one of you when you speak over each other.PENCE: The director of FBI, our homeland security said, ""We can't know for certain who these people are coming from Syria.""KAINE: Yes, we can.PENCE: Syria --KAINE: And we don't let them know. We don't let them in.PENCE: She had a Clinton Foundation accepting contributions from foreign governments and foreign --KAINE: You are Donald Trump --PENCE: Don't --KAINE: Donald Trump's apprentice. Let me talk about this --PENCE: Senator, I think, I think I'm still on my time.KAINE: Well, I think -- isn't this a discussion?(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Ah. So what is up with Tim Kaine, anyway? Is his middle name co? (inaudible) to Howard Dena on that one. Let's share another line.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PENCE: I was in Washington, D.C. on, on 9/11. I saw the clouds of smoke rise from the Pentagon.KAINE: I was in Virginia where the Pentagon --(CROSSTALK)PENCE: I know you were. That's small potatoes compared to Hillary Clinton calling .QUIJANO: Senator Kaine?PENCE: . half of Donald Trump supporters a basket of deplorables.KAINE: Hillary Clinton said something on the campaign trail, and the very next day, she said, ""You know, I shouldn't have said that.""PENCE: She said she shouldn't have said half --KAINE: Look, look, look --QUIJANO: Governor, this is Senator Kaine's two minutes, please.KAINE: Yeah, that's right. So now we're even.PENCE: Yeah.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Yeah. Now we're even. If you want to see who lost the debate, find out who is whining most about it. But last night is different, Pence clearly won despite moderator bias. Elaine Quijano lost control, which happens when you only corral one cat and that one cat is more amped than Pete Townshend's Gibson. The debate turned into an airline counter after the flights are canceled, and if that one guy, Johnny Eyebrows mugging his elastic face to get the attention of the ticket agent. The debate was hard to follow, abrupt right turns, left turns, heavy breaking, it was like watching a squirrel take a driving test. Still, Pence rose above it like a tugboat among churn. He turned into a fifth animatronics head destined for Mount Rushmore, stony but stoic. Pence looked like a president; Kaine look like your band teacher. So oddly enough, the chaos actually helped Pence for his reactions reflected truth lost in the chaos of 2016. Experience doesn't just mean establishment, it can also mean cool confidence. Last, the debate contrasted two belief systems. If a Martian saw those two men last night, how could it not guess which one is conservative? It's the one who conserves, the calm leader gently swaddling away acoustic fly. And you got to admit, Pence has great eyesight, 20/20. Hmm. All right Eric, what did you make of the debate overall in terms of like the moderator and the structure?ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: You know, I liked the moderator. I thought she got a lot of topics in.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: A lot of substance. A lot of policy questions were asked. I know there was a lot of, you know, there's a lot of analysis on how many times she asked Pence a hard question versus Kaine. But it -- but what I like about it was -- it showed who Tim Kaine was.GUTFELD: Right.BOLLING: I had no idea. First of all, I, I pushback a little bit when Donald Trump picked Mike Pence. And now I look into, wow, what a brilliant pick that was .DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: True.BOLLING: . because those two sat there, they went man -- mano a mano, which means hand to hand not man to man, but mano a mano.GUTFELD: I just learned that now.BOLLING: And Pence was measured --(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: He was respectful, intelligent, confident, whereas Kaine, condescending, interrupting course. He was abrasive. And I just thought of the American people, if you are sitting there wondering if the top of the ticket goes down for whatever reason, it is incapacitated. Which one of these two guys do you want? And there's no question, Pence trounced Kaine.GUTFELD: Kimberly, it was a lot of crosstalk, which never happens on cable news or on panel shows for that matter.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: I don't know what you are talking about, what?GUTFELD: I don't know either.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: What could she have done to improve that? It seemed like a lot -- it went off the rails a little bit --GUILFOYLE: Yeah, I think she could have controlled it, to be honest with you. I obviously, he had an agenda to interrupt as many times as possible so he gets the gold medal for the most interruptions in, you know, the quick timeframe of the debate. But I think she had to like set those rules straight up from the beginning, ""Listen, I'm not going to tell you again, please don't interrupt. Let's respect, you know, I have both sides time to speak."" Something to that effect or I saw Megyn Kelly said she will give them the hand for at the first, that's the signal international sign for stop and then try and take control from there. But, you know, I think overall, she did a good job. That was -- that wasn't so great, but it was more to the fault of Tim Kaine, for not being professional and for interrupting all the time. He really just did himself a disservice. I mean if Hillary wins the presidency, people are going to be like praying, lighting candles. Hillary, stay healthy because this guy just seemed to me, to not be presidential. I liked him more before I listened to him in that debate last night. And I don't know if that was the advice that he was getting from a Clinton campaign from, you know, Robby Mook or what, because he seemed so. He won because he interrupted the most and he didn't let, you know, Pence get his words out. Pence, to me, seemed calm. He seemed informed. He was prepared. He was presidential. And he was, well, actually, very good picked by Donald Trump. And Dana, I heard you say something last night, right after the debate, talking about a lot of people were thinking, hmm, is pence going to run? Was he going to be at the top of the ticket? I mean, he really I think proves himself to be a good choice for those that were supporters of his to begin with it. That would have like to see him on the ticket at the top.PERINO: Yeah, I was saying that they have before there were 17 candidates in 2015 and people mused for a couple years before the announcement of who was going to run, people would -- on the conservative side would say, well, Mike Pence should definitely be in the mix of that. And then when he decided not to run as a presidential candidate, I think there was a lot of disappointment. I thought the debate was so rushed in the first 20 minutes, I was like, whoa! What in the world? And then it calmed down so much after that, that I kept finding myself going, wait, what did they just say about social security? Because there was a lot more that could have been teased out from that. I do think she missed some opportunities for some follow-up questions or they did for each other .GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: . especially on some of the things like -- for example, I think Mike Pence did was an excellent, but one of the things he do was totally dodge some of the questions and the points that Kaine was making a cut on Quijano made about or what about when Donald Trump said X or Y? And he was like, oh, he just blew right passed that. Great style points, but I do think that in some ways that was probably a little bit disconcerting for some people. But for conservatives watching it, Mike Pence was a champion last night.GUTFELD: Uh -huh. Juan, I thought the problem was that Elaine Quijano .PERINO: Quijano.GUTFELD: . kept sticking to a script.PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: And when the chaos -- they're like they go in some different argument and then she would like, oh no, we got --PERINO: Like we have to talk about Syria.GUTFELD: Yeah, we have to talk about this. And that didn't help. But also I, I think Kaine didn't help her either.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, no. I think she was a weak moderator. I mean, I think that's what came through is that she was trying to organize these people and their goal was to talk.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: So, well, let's go to the big picture here, the day after. The day after what I hear from republicans is, wow, what a relief. You know, after that terrible week with Trump's disastrous debate performance, miss universe, the tax story. Boy, Pence really held his own. We don't have any problem with what Mike Pence did. And we can argue because the polls show it, (inaudible) group, CNN instant poll .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: . that what you get was Pence being the more likeable candidate. His numbers, his favorability numbers inching up while you saw Kaine's go down. The key, I think Greg is that Pence exceeded expectations in terms of his performance and especially so for republicans who, some of whom say to me today, they even feel like you know, it's buyer's remorse. I think we hear a little bit about around the table like, gee, maybe he should have been the candidate, right?BOLLING: Oh, no, no.WILLIAMS: Oh yeah. I hear that.GUTFELD: Well, I felt -- when I saw Pence there, I said that, that guy, he is, he is presidential.WILLIAMS: But I --PERINO: So but a conservative.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: Yeah, he is more conservative.GUTFELD: He was a conservative.WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: Or conservative, possibly maybe even more presidential.GUTFELD: Way more presidential.BOLLING: Keep talking to bring out the turnout, the type of crowds He will not bring out, the turnout, the type of crowds and the vote and the enthusiasm .GUILFOYLE: That Trump does.BOLLING: . that Donald Trump does. I mean --GUTFELD: We don't know that.BOLLING: And, and --WILLIAMS: Now --BOLLING: If you started with a Mike Pence in the field of 17 is, do you sure that Mike Pence is the last man standing?(CROSSTALK)PERINO: And that's --WILLIAMS: I don't think --PERINO: And that's the rub.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Obviously not.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: . universe.WILLIAMS: But here is my point that struck me last night. I was watching debate with Ms. Dana Perino, and I, to my break --PERINO: We had a blast.WILLIAMS: I was thinking, hey, you know what? This guy -- Pence is throwing Trump under the bus .GUTFELD: Really?WILLIAMS: Time and time again. And when, you know, so the prosecutorial mode that Tim Kaine employed, which is, hey, he calls women dogs, he said that Mexicans are rapists, he said that Putin is a great guy and Pence -- Tim Kaine, coming back to this and you never saw Mike Pence .PERINO: He never owned it.WILLIAMS: . respond and defend Donald Trump.GUTFELD: But I think, you know, part of the reason was Kaine had piled them so -- as so many of them, and he was also so irritating.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: He was irritating. And his concept of eye contact -- I actually, I have to defend the moderator. When Pence would talk, Kaine would just look right at the moderator and go like this.GUILFOYLE: Didn't he wink at her at one time?(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Yeah, he was like constantly deflecting her so that she had to go to him whenever.PERINO: She's an exceedingly nice person.GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: And a gentle person.GUTFELD: Probably.PERINO: And she's a mom. And so maybe she could have said, ""Oye! Stop it.""GUTFELD: Yes.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: Knock it off.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Going in she said she had nine, nine topics, nine buckets that she wanted to get to, 90 minutes with a two-minute response from each. I'm looking at beyond, that's very, very aggressive to be able get that especially .GUILFOYLE: She wanted to do what Lester .BOLLING: . pointed out.GUILFOYLE: . didn't do.BOLLING: What Greg points out that Tim Kaine never really answered what he was asked. He was just took a shot and turned it to a Trump dig.PERINO: Do you think they should have had the buzzer?BOLLING: Instead of answering the question.PERINO: Like in the primary debates?BOLLING: Honestly, I love that debate. I, I thought it was great. They both went at it, she didn't introduce --GUILFOYLE: I thought it was really good.BOLLING: She didn't fact check. You know what, and I think for once I thought that was great. Let the candidates --WILLIAMS: Oh, yes.BOLLING: Let the candidates duke it out. If someone said something they don't agree with or think is wrong, then, then point it out. I like that format best.WILLIAMS: So this is what bothered me. So I'm watching it. And I -- you know, because right now, today understand it stylistically, it was a huge win for Mike Pence, that he looked calm. He wasn't interrupting. But as I was watching Eric, what I saw was that when the issue was brought up about Vladimir Putin. Here's Mike Pence, ""that guy is a bully, that guy is"" -- I'm thinking, but wait a minute, that's not what Donald Trump said.BOLLING: Right. So what we talked about yesterday, is this debate about defending the boss or is this debate to find out who these two guys are in the event the bosses incapacitated?WILLIAMS: When Mike Pence --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: When Tim Kaine says, ""Donald Trump says we're going to punish women who have abortions,"" he says, ""Oh, no, no."" And I'm thinking, but that's exactly what he said. Or when, in fact, Mike Pence himself said Vladimir Putin is a better leader than Barack Obama. You know what? I believe Mike Pence said, ""No, I didn't say that."" I'm thinking myself, where is the fact checker? What's going on here?GUILFOYLE: Well the fact checker, the people sitting at home .BOLLING: Right.GUILFOYLE: . like all of us that can make a decision and be informed and say, that was stated before, it wasn't. I mean, I think she tried to get through a long list of subjects. One of the criticisms of the presidential debate was that Lester Holt didn't get to enough, like wait, what about barometer (ph)? What about the -- we brought up all these issues. What about choice? All about that that didn't get through.BOLLING: What about Alicia Machado when she wasn't even a question .GUTFELD: But you know --BOLLING: . Lester Holt.GUTFELD: But also, can I just -- we don't have time -- I just want to get this sound on tape which is, it shows that Quijano asked a number of questions to Pence, but not that many to Kaine.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)QUIJANO: Governor, with all due respect, the question was about whether it seems fair to you that Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible.PENCE: (inaudible) if you remember the issue --QUIJANO: So Governor, how would these millions of undocumented immigrants leave? Would they be forcibly removed?(CROSSTALK)QUIJANO: Governor, the question was about homegrown.PENCE: Yes.QUIJANO: Yes.PENCE: And so, but you asked the trustworthy question at the very beginning. The reason that the American people .QUIJANO: Governor, your two minutes are up.PENCE: . don't trust Hillary Clinton is because they are looking at the pay to play politics that she operated with the Clinton Foundation through a private server .QUIJANO: Governor, please.PENCE: . while she's secretary of state.QUIJANO: Your two minutes are up.PENCE: Senator, we would know a lot more about if Hillary Clinton would just turn over the 33,000 e-mails that she refused to turn over .QUIJANO: All right, let's turn back to North Korea.(CROSSTALK)QUIJANO: Senator Kaine .PENCE: . in her private server.QUIJANO: if you had intelligence --PENCE: . and we'd have a much better picture of what the Clinton Foundation was about.QUIJANO: Senator Kaine --(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: So he brought up some very important topics and -- but she had to get back on to the thing, so she goes hard on Pence, soft on Kaine. That's what I saw.GUILFOYLE: Look .GUTFELD: No?GUILFOYLE: . that was the general consensus. But you know, she was trying to keep her composure and I have to tell you, I'm so impressed with Mike Pence's ability to stay focus, stayed on message. She was able to -- he didn't get mired in all the specific -- oh, Trump said this, this, this, this and this. Then he would be there all night .GUTFELD: Yeah, and beat --GUILFOYLE: . trying to like go through .GUTFELD: He knew that.GUILFOYLE: . the laundry list .GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: . that he was saying. It was more about Kaine putting that heat in, that rapid fire, but he wasn't certainly defending Hillary Clinton. I didn't hear anything about --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I think that's exactly what he did and that what those --GUILFOYLE: He's he -- he hit Trump.WILLIAMS: No, but I'm saying the instant poll today said that Kaine did a better job with defending Clinton than .BOLLING: Yeah, because you know why?(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: . of defending Trump.BOLLING: Because Pence didn't take the attack that I'm going to attack Hillary Clinton. He didn't attack Hillary.WILLIAMS: No, no. I was talking about defending your candidate.BOLLING: Yeah, but it so it looks like Kaine did a better job defending the boss because he was never really pressed on some of the stuff that Hillary Clinton has been accused of. It's been -- it was the other way. It was -- it was Kaine taking shots at Donald Trump through, though .WILLIAMS: Oh, I thought .BOLLING: . at Mike Pence.WILLIAMS: I thought you would been a lot -- I thought the reason you liked it was .GUILFOYLE: What?WILLIAMS: . because what you saw was Mike Pence went at the e-mail, he went at the deplorables comment, and I think Kaine .BOLLING: He was --WILLIAMS: . did a good job of defending.BOLLING: No, I haven't -- I don't think he -- I think Mike Pence spent most of the time answering the quick question, answering the .(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: . the Trump attack question and turning --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: I really do.WILLIAMS: Well, that's the final word --BOLLING: He brilliantly, master -- masterfully debated Tim Kaine .WILLIAMS: Well, my --BOLLING: . and beat him.WILLIAMS: My final word on this is did anybody who is undecided come to a decision? According to the ""Wall Street Journal .""BOLLING: Well, I'm not sure about that.WILLIAMS: . according to polls, no.GUILFOYLE: Well, according to CNN that's incorrect.WILLIAMS: No. According --GUILFOYLE: Their poll -- no?WILLIAMS: Both undecided not to wait.GUILFOYLE: Their --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Their pools said that more people that were gravitating .(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: . towards Trump after that debate and listening to Kaine and Pence.GUTFELD: I'm over -- I'm talking right over you, just like they did.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Yes. All right, still to come, Trump and Clinton's thoughts on last night's debate -- that will be fun. Plus, the latest on the (inaudible) came that in the east coast is on high alert, bracing for the massive storm that killed at least 11 in the Caribbean, a live update from the Fox weather center, ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: And back now to last night's vice-presidential debate. It started off with a handshake, but quickly got ugly. Here is more from the dramatic Kaine-Pence showdown.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PENCE: The campaign of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine has been an avalanche of insults.KAINE: Do you want a ""you're hired"" president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a ""you're fired"" president in Donald Trump? He loves dictators. He's got kind of a personal Mount Rushmore, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un .PENCE: Please.KAINE: . Muammar Gaddafi .PENCE: Oh come on.KAINE: . and Saddam Hussein. And last --PENCE: If your son .QUIJANO: Two hundred fifty thousand people .PENCE: . or my son handled classified information the way Hillary Clinton did .QUIJANO: . one hundred thousand of them children -- Governor .PENCE: . They'd be court-martialed.KAINE: That is absolutely false and you know that.PENCE: Absolutely true.KAINE: And you know that Governor.QUIJANO: Governor .PENCE: It's absolutely true.(CROSSTALK)KAINE: Some fool or maniac could trigger a catastrophic event. And I think that's who Governor Pence's running mate is, exactly .PENCE: Oh come on.KAINE: . President Reagan warned us about.PENCE: Senator, Senator, there was even beneath you and Hillary Clinton and that, that's pretty low.(END VIDEO CLIP)(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: How low can you go? So who won last night's face-off? Shockingly, the mainstream media even said Pence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PENCE: I had a little debate last night.(APPLAUSE)PENCE: I was humbled and honored to be there. Donald Trump called me late last night from Nevada to congratulate me on the debate.(APPLAUSE)PENCE: That really meant the world to me. It truly did. Some people think I won.(APPLAUSE)PENCE: I will leave that to others.(CROSSTALK)PENCE: You know, what I can tell you is from where I sat, Donald Trump won the debate.(APPLAUSE)PENCE: Donald Trump's vision to make America great again, won the debate.(APPLAUSE)CHRIS MATTHEWS, LIBERAL MSNBC HOST: Overall, I think the winner tonight will end up being -- in terms of the debate and what they were trying to accomplish -- Pence, because Pence really was solid. He looked like he had his head screwed on.JOHN DICKERSON, ""FACE THE NATION"" MODERATOR: Mike Pence was all the things that Donald Trump was not in his debate. He was clearly -- he clearly studied and he was unflappable pretty much in the face of all those interruptions.MARK HALPERIN, MSNBC SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I think -- even honest democrats would say Tim Kaine had some good moments but not his best night. But I think Pence won on the stage.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: And there you have it. That was like a bonus round. We gave you two, sound on tapes for price of one. So the first one, Pence having an event today, we understand Kaine hasn't had one yesterday, but will later this evening. And then Dana, the mainstream media right away -- right after the debate, I heard Chris Matthews saying, ""Pence won."" I was like, oh, is --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Well, I think that was -- it was just so obvious.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: I mean there was really no question about it. I do think that Kaine, probably feels like he hit the objectives that he wanted to do, which is probably did no harm to the Clinton campaign. But Pence probably did some help, not just for the Trump campaign, but I really think that what he did last night was shore up and help some of those republican senate candidates in the tough states where those elections really close or so where you have a battleground state where both Trump and Clinton are either tied or it's, you know, is they are traveling there a lot. And the Senate is such an important thing for republicans to try to hold on to, that I think Pence was extremely helpful for them last night and they should just run with that.GUILFOYLE: And do you think perhaps, Eric, this is a little bit of a salve for some of the other conservatives to say, you know, this guy -- this was a good pick, Pence is excellent if he's going to be around Trump and the two of them together as a team perhaps, producing good quality decisions and results?BOLLING: Yeah, Yeah. So the first thing in the morning, I was waiting to see any -- I like to go through all the different channels and see what the spin is. See how the spin starts out. And I'm telling you, at 6 o'clock in the morning, the spin was, yeah, Pence did good on style, but substance, you know he -- he didn't -- as Juan was pointing out, you know he didn't have right answers about what Trump said or he couldn't defend Trump properly. By about the second or third hour in the morning, they abandoned that and said basically, ""Yeah, you won, so Pence really won this one."" And -- and you are right, and so, so if you are a Trump supporter, if you are a Trump fan you go, well here is his first real decision he has to make. Pick a vice-president. Pick a nominee to run with you. And he picked the right guy. Clearly, I would say he picked the right guy because he, he bounced. Yesterday said, Trump is -- and Hillary Clinton are, are the pizza and the chicken wings. These are the vegetables side -- Pence, brought the vegetables, he brought some broccoli.GUILFOYLE: OK. Was there any dip with that?PERINO: Yeah, ranch.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Ranch is very tasty as broccoli, indeed. So Juan, a bunch of my friends, you know being from San Francisco and whatnot, are quite liberal.WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: And one of my best friends, Ann (ph), you guys better hear, with a huge Bernie Sanders supporter, t-shirt and everything. So now she's going to go ahead and go for Hillary. So we're in a little bit of a dust up over that. But she was writing this, it's like, wow, this guy Pence, you know even though he is very pro life, all of that, she said, he does it in a way that is non-threatening, that's quite likeable. And she said these guys could be a contender if Hillary wins, you know, in 2020, people found him to be very likeable and also, clearly thought that he won the debate.WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know about clearly. I think he did -- the people think he won the debate and as the day has gone on, as Eric said, I think it has become conventional wisdom. By the way, on the point that -- is her name Ann (ph)?GUILFOYLE: Uh-huh.WILLIAMS: So on the point that Ann (ph) made, I must tell you, the people were saying today that the big winner in this debate may be Mike Pence for 2020 that suddenly he is in the conversation if Trump doesn't win the presidency, right? So --GUTFELD: I said that on my mono.WILLIAMS: Is that right?(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: There we go, and if you hear from Greg Gutfeld .BOLLING: Someone's --WILLIAMS: . take it to the bank.BOLLING: The big loser was Ted Cruz.PERINO: No.BOLLING: That's exactly right.GUILFOYLE: That was her next statement on the --BOLLING: Yes.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: But I want to say that one thing --GUILFOYLE: Ted Cruz is crying somewhere in the corner .WILLIAMS: So here --GUILFOYLE: . after that.WILLIAMS: But here is the Clinton camp.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: So the Clinton camp, which is ends, you know, that ends that she's gonna vote Clinton. But here's what the Clinton Camp said is saying today, ""We liked, we liked what Tim Kaine did, because they were aiming -- not maybe to Ann (ph) if Ann is really voting for them, but to white republican suburban women. And they want that message about all the nasty things, the dogs, the nasty women trump has said, they want it repeated. They want it out there and they may be making ads.GUILFOYLE: Uh -huh, yeah, so .PERINO: Tim Kaine sacrificed himself for 2020.GUILFOYLE: She's white college educated.PERINO: On behalf of those --GUILFOYLE: . with the (inaudible) doctorate, so lawyer. OK, go ahead.GUTFELD: It's, it's actually amazing. Have you -- as any of you heard from anybody who thought Kaine won? Has anybody --GUILFOYLE: Yes, Robby Mook.GUTFELD: That -- you see that he probably insane .GUILFOYLE: Clinton camp.GUTFELD: . unbalanced.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: He needs to see somebody right away. Because when you Chris Matthews, there's no one left. I think the important thing to -- when we talk about Pence is that he is stoic and we are living in emotional times, you know, there are a lot of hate and divisiveness and stuff, but it's, it was refreshing to see something calm and reassuring. And he -- I mean, look, he disagrees with Trump on free-trade, on immigration, on --WILLIAMS: Keep going.GUTFELD: On a number of things, but, but -- so, will Trump listen to him, A? Will Pence have influence? Will he be like a Dick Cheney, or will he'll be like --BOLLING: Joe Biden.GUTFELD: Joe Biden.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: And wear sunglasses in (inaudible) that he has it.GUILFOYLE: And it makes sense.GUTFELD: We don't know.GUILFOYLE: Well, I have to say this, the thriller in vanilla. Sometimes vanilla is just right. What did trump and Clinton think of their running mates performances last night? Their reactions, next. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Hi. Welcome back to ""The Five."" So what do the presidential rivals think of last night's V.P. smack-down? Here was Trump earlier.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Mike Pence did an incredible job. And I'm getting a lot of credit, because that's really my first so-called choice. That was my first hire, as we would say in Las Vegas. And I will tell you, he's a good one.He was phenomenal. He was cool. He was smart. He was -- I mean, you just take a look at him. He was meant to be doing what he's doing. And we are very, very proud of Governor Mike Pence. Thank you, Mike Pence.I'd argue that Mike had the single most decisive victory in the history of vice-presidential debates.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Well, Hillary is off the trail, but she did raise her running mate's performance with two thumbs up while getting on her plane earlier. And she posted on Twitter last night, ""Lucky to have a partner like Tim Kaine, who stood up for our shared vision tonight, instead of trying to deny it.""Now Dana, I'm curious if Kaine had done well and Pence didn't do well, would she find an event to take a victory lap?They might have let it sit and let him have his moment. She's serious about debate prep and understand that's where she is today. I don't think she would give up that time for anything in the world. I'm curious. If Kaine had done very well and Pence didn't do so well, would Hillary be out there? Would she find some event to do to get out there and take a victory lap?PERINO: I don't know. I think in some ways, they may have just let it -- let it sit and let him have his moment. I think that she's very serious about debate prep, and understand that that's where she is today in Washington, D.C. And I don't think she would give up that time for anything in the world. I think that, if Kaine had done very well, it probably would have -- they probably would have stuck to schedule.BOLLING: Do you think it's interesting that Donald was out there talking about it?GUILFOYLE: Yes, well, look, I think that he's going to get out -- one, I like that he's out there saying that, you know, Pence did a great job. That Pence is awesome. He wasn't just saying, you know, ""He's awesome."" So that was nice. And I thought it was supportive.I think that they have a nice relationship. And it's -- so far, we haven't heard anything to the contrary. So I think that was very positive for him. Showed that they're a good team. So maybe that was good for people.In terms of Hillary, I think she's probably thinking, ""Yes, told you I was awesome, and I should be the top of the ticket and not Tim Kaine."" In her silent thoughts.BOLLING: So we were -- we reported that Hillary is in D.C. prepping already. This is for Thursday. Can you over-prep for this?GUTFELD: I don't know. I'm always for preparation. Because the more you prepare, the less you -- the less you screw up, because you always have something in your brain. If you're not thinking of anything, you have something to pluck off that thought tree.However, I have to talk about her tweet. ""Lucky"" -- Hillary tweeted, ""Lucky to have a partner who stood up for a shared vision instead of denying it."" That was such a jab at Bill Clinton, who's totally undermined her all week.GUILFOYLE: I get it.BOLLING: Yes, we can -- we're going to talk about that.GUILFOYLE: There's a couple meanings to that.BOLLING: Your thoughts on the candidates' handling of their -- the V.P. performance?WILLIAMS: Well, I think Hillary Clinton hit it on target when she said that Tim Kaine stood up for their vision. And I don't think -- that's why I think -- that's why when I was watching I said, ""Hey, why doesn't Pence defend Trump?""But here's the thing I think might take away, is that Trump can learn from Mike Pence. So we go into Sunday night, and I think the restraint, I think the tenor -- because remember, everybody at the table says stylistically, Mike Pence hit it right. He didn't look agitated. He didn't look temperamental. He looked even-keel, right Eric? So I think that's the big thing.I think the second thing that I would say is, you know, if you're thinking about tweeting during the debate -- which is what he did -- Trump did, let's get away from that whole milieu, you know, actually, last night he was complimentary of us FOX News. He said he was going to watch FOX News. We give him an even shot.He then got into a little thing with Megyn Kelly about Kellyanne Conway. He said -- Megan said, ""Apparently, Kellyanne Conway is going to be there to keep control of those tweets, And apparently, Kellyanne was in Virginia. Trump was in Nevada. So stay away from that -- that whole way of thinking. And I think he would do better.BOLLING: You guys think he's going to pivot to a more Pensive debate style?GUTFELD: I think -- I think it's possible to combine it. Why can't you combine?Like, OK, Kaine went full Trump. But he couldn't do it. He tried to be the smartass and talk like a tweet. It doesn't work.What's wrong with just, like, taking two sides, the yin and yang, Pence and Trump, and pushing it together and mushing it into one super Pence-Trump?GUILFOYLE: Wow.BOLLING: Didn't -- didn't Joe Biden kind of pull the same kind of thing that Kaine did but it came over a lot better? Didn't it go over better against Ryan?PERINO: Well, Biden has a certain style. Right? Some people -- charisma is like you have it or you don't. And it just exists.GUTFELD: Tell me about it.PERINO: You know, we started out with the...GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: We are talking about preparation. So Governor Pence prepped a lot. He had Governor Scott Walker as his debating partner, who walked him through -- put him through his paces over and over again. And it really paid off. The other thing...GUILFOYLE: Yes. By the way, nice metaphor (ph); good job.PERINO: Thank you. I know my sports sometimes. That is sports, right?GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: The other thing is, so we started off with this -- in your monologue, we showed the montage of all the interrupting...GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: ... from Kaine. And there's -- Kellyanne Conway and others were tweeting this morning, ""Kaine interrupted Pence 71 times."" Like, OK, but Trump interrupted Clinton 52 times during the presidential debate.So you can learn from two things. Go ahead and prep, which we understand now Trump going to do some more of that this week. And just hold onto your thoughts for a second. Let her finish, and then go after it. Because as we've shown in both of these debates, manners still matter. Believe it or not. They do.BOLLING: And we used to interrupt each other on the show all the time. Now it's...WILLIAMS: Yes. Really? Yes, yes, yes.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: We never do it, not at all.BOLLING: Greg, you know what I'm talking about?GUTFELD: I understand exactly what you mean.BOLLING: Dana never interrupts.GUTFELD: Yes -- no.PERINO: Yes, I do.GUILFOYLE: A nice shout-out to Scott Walker. Because by the way, it's true. There was a little bit of behind the scenes there that that -- he prepared him well, I think. Good job.BOLLING: All right. Here we go. An update on Hurricane Matthew when we return. It's a very serious, life-threatening storm that's already killed nearly a dozen people in the Caribbean. And it could strike America as soon as tomorrow. So please stay tuned for the latest on its path. That's coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: This is a FOX News weather alert.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(HURRICANE WINDS)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Oh, my God.PERINO: Hurricane Matthew is moving closer to the U.S., leaving behind a deadly path of destruction across the Caribbean. Large-scale evacuations under way in parts of Florida and South Carolina, bracing for the powerful Category 3 storm that could strike as soon as tomorrow. Rick Reichmuth is in the FOX Extreme Weather Center with the latest -- Rick.RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS METEOROLOGIST: Hey, Dana.Right now, over the Bahamas, a Category 3, 120-mile-an-hour storm. It's going to impact almost all of the Bahama islands. And unfortunately, they don't have a lot of mountains with it, so it's not going to break the storm up at all as it moves through these islands. An island chain of about 700 islands.Hurricane warnings everywhere there, as well, now as the Florida coast from just to the north of Miami up towards Daytona Beach. This is likely going to be the area, at least starting tomorrow late afternoon, through Friday afternoon, that takes a raking from the storm, possibly being in the eye wall for a long time right along the coast.That yellow is tropical storm conditions. That's going to get here by tomorrow midafternoon. Hurricane conditions arrive to the coast somewhere likely right around 6 to 9 p.m. And then we're going to watch that white. That's major hurricane, right there around Melbourne, in towards the space coast.And the latest projections of this, the latest track, moving it even a little bit farther towards the west. Not good news. You get the general idea. Still some disagreement in exactly the track. But overall, it moves off towards the northwest and then curves, hugging the coastline all along the southeastern shores.And the latest advisory coming out from the National Weather Service -- or National Hurricane Center, I should say, brings a Category 4 storm right here over Cape Canaveral and towards the space coast. So it is a Category 4, major hurricane. Takes probably around 24 hours to move right here along the coast. But we could be dealing with a storm that we've never seen across areas of Florida. A lot of storm surge, potentially. Obviously, the wind, rain, flooding, the whole story. But you better be ready in Florida and Georgia, because it will be here by tomorrow, late afternoon -- Dana.PERINO: All right, Rick, thank you so much.Phil Keating is standing by in Florida, where mandatory evacuations have been ordered along the coast. The state's governor is warning residents to prepare for the worst -- Phil.PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, the governor, Dana, is actually telling residents along Florida's East Coast to simply ignore that cone of uncertainty, because as Rick just alluded to, this storm could shift 20 to 40 miles at last second, and that would completely change which populated communities get impacted.Here at this gas station is what we are finding up and down Florida's East Coast. Gas pumps, the handles are bagged and the pumps themselves not working, simply out of gas after a day of long lines, of cars and trucks filling up their vehicles just in case they might need to evacuate.Let's take a look from the International Space Station, fresh imagery just in from NASA. You can see the size and scope of Hurricane Matthew. Currently, that Cat 3, 120 miles an hour, and moving slowly through the central Bahamas, roughly 12 miles an hour. The faster it goes, the better for everybody, because that means less wind, less rain, less flooding. Of course, the slower it goes, obviously, that means the worst for everyone.Yesterday all day long in Haiti, the Dominican Republic and eastern Cuba, this storm pounded as a Category 4. Up to 40 inches of rain fell in Haiti. About a dozen people are reported dead at this point. And it could go higher, because there are more people still missing and still unaccounted for.In Florida, which looks to be the very first state impacted by this hurricane, long lines of people for the second straight day have been clogging up not only gas stations but grocery stores, Kmarts, Wal-Mart, Home Depots, as well as Costcos. People stocking up on everything they might need to survive for three to five days without power.And utility crews have prepositioned all up and down the state with extra cherry-picker trucks, just to respond as fast as possible, because it does look like there will be some power outages -- Dana.PERINO: All right. Thank you, Phil. We'll keep a close eye on this very dangerous storm and keep you informed.Ahead, we return to the presidential race. Bill Clinton made another gaffe on the trail yesterday, fresh off the heels of his Obamacare blunder. We will have it next. Nice.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: Bill Clinton is not doing a whole lot to help his wife's campaign this week. On Monday, he tore apart Obamacare.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You've got this crazy system, where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care, and then the people that are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It's the craziest thing in the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: That left Hillary to attempt to clean it up.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can you clarify what he meant? And do you worry it could undercut your argument that you want to build on and expand the Affordable Care Act?HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: No, I don't.I think he made it clear what he was saying.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Yesterday, Bill went rogue again, forgetting that his wife's former opponent, Bernie Sanders, now on her side.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)B. CLINTON: Wait, wait, wait, wait. I agree, if I had sent millions of your people to prison, or she had, that would be good. Hillary didn't vote for the '94 Crime Bill, even though Senator Sanders did.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Oh!WILLIAMS: Not exactly the best surrogate for Secretary Clinton right now, I'd say.The Trump campaign eating it up, saying Bill is their best surrogate.So Dana, recalling what happened when he met Loretta Lynch on the plane, that was a big dust-up.GUILFOYLE: Well, it works.WILLIAMS: The Black Lives Matter, that was -- that was a big dust-up.GUILFOYLE: It did work. No jail for the wife.WILLIAMS: Well, so what's going on?PERINO: Well, when Bill Clinton is out there, it gets headlines. And so we haven't seen this for a long time. I mean, in some ways George W. Bush had to deal with questions of whether he was distancing from his father. This is even, I think, more real in terms of does Hillary Clinton have to distance herself from her husband, because she has different policy positions than he had?I think that it makes for good headlines. I think it's not great for the Hillary campaign. But I also understand anecdotally from friends in the Democratic Party that Bill Clinton is beloved by the party.WILLIAMS: I think that's true.PERINO: They love him. They will show up for him. And he's a -- he actually is probably a better surrogate for her than we'd realize.WILLIAMS: Well, Eric, I think he still gets big crowds, as Dana said.BOLLING: Oh, he stepped in it, Juan. He stepped in it.WILLIAMS: But also, he did a spectacular speech at the convention.BOLLING: He stepped in it. They really need to -- if they want to win, they need to pull him back. Just send him -- send him away somewhere and keep him busy. Who knows how? Whatever. We won't go there.Steve Schmidt today said something very important. I think he nailed it. He said Bill Clinton has done something that has delivered the message that Republicans haven't been able to deliver.PERINO: Yes. Absolutely.BOLLING: And he's 100 percent right. There are small businesses out there busting it for 60 hours a week, and they can't afford their own health care. Meanwhile, people who aren't working, 20 million people, are getting health care on the backs of them. That's important to note.And if the Republicans are right and Trump's campaign is smart, they'll seize on that, make the ads about that and talk about that a lot come Sunday night.WILLIAMS: Well, Kimberly, do you think it's fair?GUILFOYLE: Listen, Bill Clinton is beloved. You know, I've spent a lot of time around him. Nobody works the crowd or the room like Bill does. And he may have stepped in it. But there isn't any mess that Clinton makes that a dry cleaner can't get out.WILLIAMS: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.GUILFOYLE: The point is, he's Teflon.WILLIAMS: All right, all right, all right. Greg usually says things like that.GUTFELD: A lot of great headlines, that's for sure.PERINO: Oh, my.GUTFELD: But he's great for Hillary. He is the spicy gumbo, and she's the cold broth. He's the charming one. He may have lost a step, but a slow Bill Clinton is still preferable to a fast Hillary.WILLIAMS: All right.GUILFOYLE: A fast Hillary.WILLIAMS: Got to clean this up. That's right here. ""One More Thing"" up next.GUILFOYLE: Aisle seven.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: Time for ""One More Thing"" -- Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: All right. So this is probably interesting to everyone at the table and those of you at home.The first trailer has been released for ""Patriot Day."" Have you heard about this? This is an upcoming movie about the Boston Marathon bombing. So it's getting a little bit of creative license here in Hollywood. It's directed by Peter Berg, who's a very good director. The movie stars Mark Wahlberg as a police officer racing against the clock to hunt down the bombers before they strike again. Take a look at this.GUTFELD: I can't wait.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(MUSIC)(CHEERING)(EXPLOSION)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: All right.GUILFOYLE: So it's getting some good buzz about it. And it also stars Kevin Bacon and John Goodman. And Peter Berg and Wahlberg worked together on ""Lone Survivor,"" one of my favorite movies, with our friend, Marcus Luttrell, that I was at a special screening with them.GUTFELD: Dana.PERINO: OK, so The Tennessean this morning, a great newspaper, of course, had an article just straight after my own heart.GUTFELD: What?PERINO: It's called ""What the Cuss? 50 Swear Word Alternatives.""GUTFELD: Oh, my.GUILFOYLE: My gosh.PERINO: If you go to our Facebook page, you can find things like -- this is like -- you know Shannon Breen?GUILFOYLE: Shannon Breen, who's the best (ph).PERINO: She says, ""Biscuits.""GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: That's one of hers. ""Dagnabbit"" is one. ""Son of a monkey"" I'd never heard. ""Holy cow,"" of course, we all know. There's 50 of them. So if you have a problem with swear words or you want to teach your children alternatives -- they even have my favorite, ""H-E double hockey sticks.""GUTFELD: Swearing is healthy. Imagine what humans did before swearing. They stabbed each other. Swearing was the -- was the alternative to murder.Anyway, sorry. Where am I? Eric.BOLLING: OK, let's do it.GUILFOYLE: OK, psycho.BOLLING: Do the white board.GUILFOYLE: Say some swear words, so you don't go stabbing everyone.BOLLING: Who is going to control the Senate? It's a quick breakdown of what's going on. These are all Real Clear Politics averages. Forty-seven -- the safe states, 47 Democrat, 46 Republican. And these are seven tossups. They're saying Indiana goes to the Democrats, Evan Bayh.PERINO: I don't think so.BOLLING: That or going -- you don't think so?PERINO: I think Evan Bayh will lose.BOLLING: That would even be better for the Republicans. Nevada, Joe Heck. New Hampshire, Kelly Ayotte. Roy Blunt in Missouri. And Florida, Marco Rubio. That would put the Republicans at 50. And that will put the Democrats at 48, leaving two, which means in order for the win, Republicans would need one. Democrats would have to win both of those, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, and the presidency to keep the Senate. To get the Senate. To get the Senate back.PERINO: I think the Republicans will definitely keep North Carolina.BOLLING: Very strong leaning right. Right.GUTFELD: All right, kids. We're going to go to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Greg's Medical Tips.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: You know when you see somebody crying, don't automatically think that they're sad. They could be suffering from something called CDE, chronic dry eye.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Dana Perino, are you feeling emotional this evening? I noticed the tear -- just a single tear rolling down your face.PERINO: No, I have chronic dry eye. And it's horrible.(SLOWED DOWN) It's horrible.It's horrible.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Thirty-five million people have it.PERINO: It's a big deal.GUTFELD: Yes, it is.PERINO: This eye will sometimes leak. This eye, completely dry. And Kimberly has it, too.GUILFOYLE: My left eye, too. I've got to get the plug out of it.GUTFELD: Let's go to Juan.WILLIAMS: All right. So if you dream about going into space, you know what? It's closer than you think.GUILFOYLE: What?WILLIAMS: Today in Texas, space start-up Blue Origin had a successful rocket launch. The rocket took off, landed safely. In a test of its safety escape features. This rocket will carry tourists into space to get a look through its massive windows.But for now, take a look at this. The images from the Hubble telescope, image of a star like our sun exploding. By the way, don't worry about our sun. It's good for another five billion years.GUTFELD: Four, three, two, one.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

They ""were"" pretty much all winnable...Or at least 44 of them were.That's how many states Reagan would go onto win, in an election this week 32 years ago, he didn't seem electorally to have a chance.Funny thing, politics. Funny thing, conventional wisdom.No wonder why Reagan liked to laugh about his age. He was the only guy who remembered...history.I'm not saying history repeats itself.I am saying what the experts tell you will happen...almost never does.Don't take it from me.Take it from...The Gipper."

This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" October 5, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, 34 days from the election and just four days from the next presidential debate. A life- threatening storm is now bearing down on the United States as residents up and down the East Coast scramble to get out of harm's way.That's where we begin tonight's edition of ""The Kelly File."" Welcome everybody, I'm Megyn Kelly. Tonight, we have big news from the campaign trail and a big threat in the Atlantic. We will talk 2016 in a moment but we have to start with the massive hurricane that could now score a direct hit on the United States in less than 24 hours. Millions are bracing for the impact of this thing. Look at it. Hundreds of thousands are now evacuating their counties ahead of Hurricane Matthew. It is the first major hurricane threat for the United States in a decade.The monster storm killed nearly a dozen people in the Caribbean already on its march towards Florida and the East Coast. Governors in four states already declaring an emergency. President Obama urging Americans to take this very seriously and Florida Governor Rick Scott warning of the possibility of quote, ""massive destruction that we haven't seen in years.""  We have got every angle of this storm covered for you and will be updating you on its tract throughout the night and on its progress.Meanwhile just four days remain before the second of three presidential debates. On the campaign watches say could provide a reset of sorts for Donald Trump. This showdown will be unlike any other we'll see with two moderators hosting.CNN's Anderson Cooper and ABC's Martha Raddatz in a town hall format.  Meaning half of the questions will actually come directly from the voters.  The candidates are keeping very different schedules in the run up to Sunday night. Mrs. Clinton is off the campaign trail attending fund-raisers and focusing on her debate prep. Mr. Trump has been hitting the campaign trail hard in Nevada today. We hear he is going to ramp up his prep work later this week. Regardless both campaigns say they are ready to go.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: The town hall format is really a sweet spot for him. Because he is the one out there with voters every single day. I'm not sure the town hall format is great for Hillary Clinton either. She seems much more comfortable behind the podium. We have seen her out there with people. That doesn't seem like her most comfortable arena.HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I'm looking forward to our next debate next Sunday.  (APPLAUSE)I thought the first one went pretty well.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: In moments we will talk strategy with Stuart Stevens, who was a campaign strategist for Mitt Romney. But we begin tonight with Jason Miller, Trump's campaign senior communications adviser. Great to see you, Jason. Thanks for being here.JASON MILLER, TRUMP CAMPAIGN, SENIOR COMMUNICATIONS ADVISER: Good evening.  Thanks for having me.  KELLY: She really -- listen, the polls say that she won that first debate but you tell me whether she would do better to be a little less glib and a little more likeable on the subject. I mean, self-deprecating is not really Trump's thing either. But you tell me whether she's going to win over voters on the fence by the, it went pretty well, thing.MILLER: Well, I think the, why am I not 50 points ahead line, really gives you some insight into Secretary Clinton's thinking and just her attitude towards voters. And I think especially with the town hall format that we will see on Sunday night. This is really an opportunity for Mr. Trump to do well. I think this is the format that allows him to connect with people and I don't know if Secretary Clinton can memorize enough lines.KELLY: But what about -- we saw Trump in the primary season in an Anderson Cooper town hall. And he kind of got in somebody's face. I mean, the guy asked him a tough question about why he said George W. Bush knew about 9/11 before it happened or intentionally lied to get us into Iraq. One of those two dies he thinks. And Trump was like, look, it's fine, I'm not getting your vote. I mean, has he been told it is not good to yell at the voters.  Be nice to the people asking the questions, even if they are snarky question.MILLER: People loving these town halls, he tells it like he sees it. He calls it like it is. It's not like he says, not a bunch of -- or things he has been memorizing. But I think he will do well on Sunday. I think we will actually doing the town hall tomorrow night in New Hampshire. Seven o'clock. So, that will be --KELLY: Take a little practice?MILLER: Mr. Trump does a whole lot of town halls and meets and talks with voters all the time. But one we do in advance and he will do debate prep tomorrow and Friday and getting ready.KELLY: Are we going to we see a different Trump at this debate than we saw at the last one? Because, you know, some of the criticisms of him were punch back, right? Don't defend everything she lobs your way. Don't be on defense. But punch back. Punch at her and punch relentlessly actually as the night goes on.MILLER: Well, the goal go into the first debate was to make sure that it was clear, who is the insider, who is the outsider. Who is the one who is going to fight to change the economy. Who is the one who is going to fight to make her country more safe and secure? So, we felt from our end that we're able to go and accomplish that. I think this time we will going to start getting a little bit more into some specifics. I think you will going to see really the consumer benefit of Trump presidency will do for the American people. And I think that's where things is going to start to separate. Because that's where Secretary Clinton has a tough time reconnecting with people.KELLY: Does he get that she laid a trap for him with that Alicia Machado thing that he's -- right into and then he stayed in that trap for five days.MILLER: Well, look, Mr. Trump is going to defend himself. And I think it's only right (INAUDIBLE) political attack at him that he can go and defend himself.KELLY: But wait, it didn't help him. It didn't help. His ardent supporters, some of them were so disappointed that he stayed in that ugly place for five days when he had so much momentum behind him and they don't want to see him do that again.MILLER: But what they absolutely love said that he did well for that entire debate and then he stood up and then he fought for himself and he didn't back down.KELLY: Right. But we're talking about, you know, how they say, in like, drug addiction, the first step is admitting you have a problem. Right?  The first step is admitting that that was a mistake. Don't walk into the trap. Don't stay in the trap. Don't enjoy the trap. Don't extend the trap by five days.MILLER: I disagree with you. I saw the debate a bit differently. I thought Mr. Trump did fantastic. And there's a reason why we're seeing these crowds, we're seeing this energy, we're seeing this excitement. But let's look ahead to Sunday, what we think is going to come up.KELLY: Yep.MILLER: And that's the one where I reviewed a lot of game table of Secretary Clinton.KELLY: Yep.MILLER: She is always good on the first answer. She can come through.  She will have memorized probably a couple of hundred lines. She will have those down. I mean, as you start getting to the second questions, third questions, that's where she gets tripped up. And that's where she has a tough time relating with people. She can't really connect. And I think that's -- because I think the Clintons are so separated from regular people.I mean, they can't quite connect. I mean, how do you go from not been able to pay either of your mortgages when you leave the White House to being worth a couple hundred million dollars without ever doing so much as billing an hour of legal work or producing anything or winning Powerball or anything else. And so, they live in an alternate reality and I don't they get what it means to be in America.KELLY: They gave a lot of speeches. A lot of speeches that paid very, very well.MILLER: Would you paid them $500,000 for a speech?KELLY: I do not give that kind of money away. And I think Bill Clinton lived a very different life. Very different life than I have.MILLER: One of the thing though that I think is important about Sunday, just one of the things we're seeing with the election over all --KELLY: Yes.MILLER: -- is where the energy and the enthusiasm is in this race is clearly with Mr. Trump right now. We see with Secretary Clinton that there is just, you know, small crowds. Maybe a thousand. You know, if she's lucky at some of these --  KELLY: That's all true. But the cloud size does not determine what happens on Election Day. We saw that the last time around with Mitt Romney.MILLER: Voter intensity. Voter intensity is there for Mr. Trump. It's why we see it in the polls. We feel pretty good about where we're at.KELLY: Thanks for being here.MILLER: Thank you, Megyn.KELLY: Nice to see you.MILLER: I appreciate it.KELLY: Joining us now with more, Stuart Stevens, founding partner of Strategic Partners and Media. He served as a campaign strategist for Mitt Romney.Let me pick on that last point though, it may be painful for you Stuart.  Because I remember, we've seen those dwelling crowds for Romney, you know, especially in the last couple of weeks before the election. It was incredible. And people thought there's no way he is not going to win this.  No way. And yet, as we now know, the crowd size was not predicted.STUART STEVENS, STRATEGIC PARTNERS AND MEDIA: Well, you know, it is a big country. And if you have a crowd of say 60,000 a day, and you still need to get to 65 million, it is going to take you about five or six years to reach those people.KELLY: Uh-hm.STEVENS: I think it is nice to have voter intensity.KELLY: And they do have it. They do have it behind Donald Trump.STEVENS: I think Donald Trump has a smaller intense following. The question here is just, it is about addition now. Everything you do should be about addition at this stage of the campaign. What new voters is Donald Trump adding to his coalition. All those voters only get to vote once.  So, a more enthusiastic voter has the same power at the ballot box. So, that's really I think going to be the challenge on Sunday night.KELLY: So don't you expect him -- just to know that.STEVENS: Donald Trump to go out and actively reach out for more voters.KELLY: Don't we expect trump to know that? I mean, given what happened to him in the wake of the first debate, he will change a bit and be maybe a little softer. I mean, he will hit Hillary harder but he will be softer in dealing with the individual questioners at the town hall?STEVENS: I don't know. It's a different format. It suites itself better to that. Personally, I think Donald Trump is still running against Donald Trump. And he should focus on telling people more about himself. He ought to ask people for a second look if he decided not to vote for me. I think really it is a referral on Donald Trump in that sense that he still has favorables under 40 and that just limits his growth.KELLY: Uh-hm. What do you make, I'll ask the same question that I just asked about her with the -- I thought the debate went pretty well. I get that her supporters love that. They're like, yes, you go, girl. But these two candidates are fighting over this group in the middle that doesn't like either one of them. Right? These people who haven't decided, they don't like her and they don't like him. You tell me whether that sort of, yes, thing is going to go over well with these people.STEVENS: Hillary Clinton has low favorables but he has higher favorables than Donald Trump. Plus, she has a much bigger, better campaign. They designed this campaign to place her in situations where she can do okay.  They aren't asking her to go out there and win this race, carry this race on her back, like a sporting analogy. They believe that they have, an organization that can deliver a campaign message and that she has passed that threshold so people can imagine her as president of the United States.  For a lot of voters, Donald Trump hasn't passed that threshold. Still a very high number of people who can't imagine Donald Trump being president.  And I personally think that that's really what he should try to address on Sunday night.KELLY: Uh-hm. And now they are both in their own version of a presidential protection program which you say they designed her situation so she is not in a place where she feels uncomfortable or is anything unexpected can come at her which is why she sat for half an with Mary J. Blige, the singer, which is why she did entertainment tonight this evening.  Which is why we just found out that when she went on the Steve Harvey show, she have every single question given to her in writing in advance and then she feigns surprise when questions were asked.And Donald Trump with all due respect, my friend at 10:00 will go on Hannity and pretty much only Hannity and will not venture out to the unsafe spaces these days which doesn't exactly expand the tent for either one of them there. That's my two cents. Stewart, I'll give you the last word.STEVENS: I think that when you saw in the last debate Hillary Clinton was delivering messages that really resonate with certain audiences. Her comments about African-Americans and the legal system. I think the white voters like Hillary Clinton are not like Hillary Clinton. It just doesn't have the resonance it does with African-Americans. I think they have a plan, they know what their vote goes are, and they know how to put together these coalitions.KELLY: Yes. And we will see. The electoral math is looking better and better for her. Stewart, always a pleasure.Breaking tonight, new details from the national hurricane center on Matthew. The storm now has sustained wind of over 115 miles an hour. It is tracking straight toward the southeast coast of Florida. Moments ago we got word that the Ft. Lauderdale Airport is shutting down completely tomorrow morning. We will go to our weather center in moments for the latest predictions.Plus, did the Clinton campaign just make a big political error when it comes to this storm? Yes, even Matthew will be politicized.Chris Stirewalt and Dana Perino are next on what Mrs. Clinton's team just announced and why it could cause them problems in the key swing state of Florida?And then, we're getting reports that ObamaCare is suddenly facing new and serious trouble from the exact problems that the critics predicted, including right here on this broadcast two years ago.We will speak once again with Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel. A key architect of the health care overhaul. About what they told us then and what is happening now.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: You talk to somebody who said, I don't know, I was watching Fox News and they said this is horrible. See for yourself what the choices are, then make up your own mind.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Fox extreme weather alert for you tonight as we track a deadly storm that could soon impact an estimated 15 million Americans. We're getting new pictures of the devastation from the category 4 hurricane, Matthew is its name, in Haiti. Where the U.N. has declared the worse humanitarian crisis since that 2010 earthquake that left more than 200,000 dead. Look at this. Look that. We just got word that the Fort Lauderdale Airport in Florida is shutting down at 10:30 tomorrow morning. Gas station and parts of the state are running out of fuel and grocery aisles are already being cleared out as residents deal with mandatory evacuation orders.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. RICK SCOTT, R-FLA.: Regardless if there is a direct hit or not, impacts will be devastating. I cannot emphasize enough that everyone in the state must prepare now for a direct hit.OBAMA: If you get an evacuation order, just remember that you can always rebuild. You can always repair property? You cannot restore life if it is lost.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For those of you that are wondering whether you should leave or not, I again will tell you, that if you do not leave, you are putting a law enforcement officer or national guardsman's life on the line when they have to go back and get you.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Uh-hm. Meteorologist Rick Reichmuth is live in the Fox Weather Center for us tonight, Rick?RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS METEOROLOGIST: Always such a great point, when you stay, you are putting somebody else's life in danger if they have to come get you. So I'm happy to hear Governor Haley say that. Here is the storm right now. Spent the time over in Haiti and Cuba, not a lot of time, but it was enough to kind of disrupt it a little bit destruction. So it weakened down to 115 miles an hour. Still a major category three storm.  Don't be fooled by that. Latest satellite imagery representation, right here, the latest images, all indications are that it is about to go through a strengthening cycle.We generally see that during the overnight hours. That is why we will get back up to category four storm. We have hurricane watches in effect all across the Georgia coast all the way down throughout the keys. But the hurricane warnings from right up here at Daytona Beach down towards Miami and that's where we will going to be watching the brunt of this starting tomorrow afternoon. I also want to point out, it goes inland. So Orlando, you are under a hurricane warning. Not just a coastal event.And take a look at what one of our model predictions of the wind field does. By tomorrow probably around noon, we've got tropical storm force winds around Miami. And then take a look at this, Megyn, during tomorrow night, right around this time, potentially major hurricane winds right on shore here and it tracks right along the coast, all night tomorrow night, all throughout the day on Friday, the entire Eastern Coast of Florida looking to be pummeled by potentially a major hurricane starting tomorrow night.KELLY: We will make sure that we are live on the air and covering that for everyone there. Rick, thank you.REICHMUTH: You bet.KELLY: Well, it's political season. So you know that even before this storm makes land fall it is already impacting this presidential race. Team Clinton decided this was a good time to make a big advertising buy on the weather channel. In a series of major Florida markets, right? And some critics are questioning whether this move could actually end up angering some of the voters she is trying to reach.Joining me now, the new co-host of Perino and Stirewalt. I'll tell you what, did I had it right, Chris?CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Oh, it's so beautiful.  It sounds so good to hear.KELLY: I'll tell you what.STIREWALT: I'll tell you what?KELLY: Chris Stirewalt who is also our Fox News digital politics editor and Dana Perino, former White House press secretary under President George W. Bush and co-host of ""THE FIVE."" You have too many titles. You're going to have to choose which ones you want. I don't have the time.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST, ""THE FIVE"": Well, that other show is temporary so that will go away.KELLY: Okay. Well, let's leave just what that other show's title for now.  I am going to start with you Dana because you are here live on this set.  Ad buy on the weather change by Hillary. I understand the goal and running for president is to reach people.PERINO: I think it depends on what the ads are. If it's really -- if there are ads that slash and burn against Donald Trump, I don't think that would be very welcome. But if there are ads that are uplifting, it might just have a positive impact. I also think that the impact of the storm is going to be so big that they might not have a lot of commercial breaks because the impact of the storm is, if what Rick is saying actually ends up happening, we could be in a really dire situation for millions of people, for a long period of time.KELLY: How does that play politically, Stirewalt, because we saw with super storm Sandy, it did have an impact. And you know, you could argue it had an impact all the way to 2016 and cost Chris Christie a lot of Republican voters because he was hugging Barack Obama on the board walk but he denies the hug but they were exchanging little fuzzy animals that President Obama got him on the board walk.(LAUGHTER)KELLY: I keep saying to Governor Christie, because they were like, there was no hug. And I keep saying, don't make me show you the video of him winning you that little fuzzy bear. Okay. But anyway, how is that play, Chris?STIREWALT: Well, President Obama played it well. He took good advantage of that. Not only that he demonstrates bipartisanship by getting Chris Christie to accept his care bear but he also was able to blame global warming. He even stayed on, brought his actual message points from the campaign into it. Meantime, Mitt Romney couldn't even get in the state.  He couldn't get around. Christie told him to stay away which is probably right. Because what is Mitt Romney going to do other than stand around and have nice hair. He blows nicely --KELLY: Even in the storm.STIREWALT: The breeze is coming in. Right. He's blowing as the breeze is coming in. He won't be able to do anything. So, that's where running against an incumbent makes it harder because Obama could go there, he could push his message about global warming --KELLY: But not the case here.STIREWALT: But that is not the case here. We got nobody. We got people who are, who are a never was and a former. So what? And all they can do is stay away and hope that people from their parties, that the Republican governors of the states, and that president and his organization, don't screw up because if they do, it will be bad for them.KELLY: You know, Dana, we also have a presidential debate this Sunday night, you know, within 24 hours of this storm hitting land fall.PERINO: Yep. So you're going to have, this could be upwards of 15 million and multiples of that that are going to be focused on the storm. And pay little attention to the debate. Nobody pays attention as much as we do.  But it is possible that night that you could end up with Trump, like a split screen with Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, and then the weather map.  Or coverage.KELLY: Yes.PERINO: Because people are going to want to know what is happening to their communities.KELLY: And what about, you know, early voting, right? Because this is also going to impact North Carolina and Florida and you tell me whether, you know, turnout for that is a factor or is this going to depress any of that or change any of that?PERINO: Well, I have to say -- if I could defer to my co-host who I believe is working on a data dial --KELLY: I'll tell you what, you may. Stirewalt --(CROSSTALK)See how well they work together?PERINO: I don't know any answers, I just defer to him.STIREWALT: Dana is sweating me on this -- like crazy. I'm going to come up with something, it's going to be good, God damn it. But the early voting is a huge factor. Both in North Carolina and in Florida. If the storm is disrupted to a great degree that would be harmful for Democrats who like early voting and like long voting period so that they can mobilize voters, or hard to get out voters. So Democrats want this to be over quickly and not massively disruptive so they can take advantage of everyday on the map.  KELLY: It's fascinating.PERINO: But in Florida, you never know what's going to happen.KELLY: Look at Dana, we're sorry for putting her head over the satellite.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: Well, I think it is probably good. Put it back. I like it.KELLY: Dana's floating head above the storm. I don't know, that is what we're trying to say about Dana like --  PERINO: I'm having one of those weeks.KELLY: Okay. I know, remember she was crying last night.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Only through one eye.(LAUGHTER)KELLY: I got to go. Bye guys.Also tonight, well, a series of new polls show Hillary Clinton gaining ground. One major survey consistently shows Donald Trump ahead. And those pollsters are here to explain what is going on.Plus, ObamaCare now facing major new challenges. With report surfacing that the law may not survive.Up next, our old friend Zeke Emanuel. The key ObamaCare architect and renowned doctor joins with us what went wrong and why? Stay tuned.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: While good affordable health care might seem like a fanged threat to the freedom of American people, on Fox News it turns out it is working pretty well in the real world.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Fox's extreme weather alert for you now. The U.S. military is sending hundreds of U.S. troops to evacuate -- hurricane-battered Haiti, I am told tonight. As we are getting reports of a rising death toll in that country. At least 26 people dead. You're seeing the latest track of the storm heading straight for Florida and for the East Coast. Nearly two million people have been urged to evacuate from their areas and local reporters on the ground say a lot of people are planning to stay. Stay tuned for more updates throughout the evening.Well, ObamaCare has suddenly exploded back into the headlines these days after mostly sitting on the bench as an issue in 2016. It started again when President Bill Clinton called the law crazy on Monday drawing attentions to some major challenges now facing the President's signature health care law. Fox News was among those questioning for years whether ObamaCare was viable long-term based on well-documented concerns from economists and some health insurance officials and time and time again some critics of the law, Fox News Channel included, were called out by the president himself. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: We knew going into the debate that it would be some subject to distortions. It was subject to some misleading information.We're going to need everybody out there to make sure -- get the right information. Don't just read a blog or you know, some commentary. From some pundit. That has a political agenda. Don't let people confuse you.  Don't let them run the okey-doke on you. Don't be bamboozled.If you talk to somebody who said, well, I don't know, I was watching Fox News and they said it's horrible. See for yourself what the choices are then make up your own mind.While good affordable health care might seem like a feigned threat to the freedom of the American people, on Fox News, it turns out it's working pretty well in the real world.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Tonight, we have one of the key architects of Obamacare, Dr. Ezekiel Emmanuel who joins us tonight. I last spoke with him more than two years ago. We will show you some of that in a minute. But first we turn to Trace Gallagher for the latest live from our West Coast newsroom. Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, one of the nation's largest insurers, Aetna, pretty much summed it up by saying that ""policy holders are turning out to be sicker and costlier than expected and unless you have a balanced risk pool, meaning more younger and healthier people, it's impossible to provide affordable high quality health care. So, after losing $433 million over the past two years, starting in 2017, Aetna will stop selling Obamacare in 11 of the 15 states it now serves.United Healthcare, the nation's largest insurer says it lost $1 billion over the past two years and in 2017, it too will exit most healthcare exchanges. As a result, consumers in a third of the country will soon have only one or two insurance companies to pick from. And the lack of competition means big time rate increases for example in Tennessee, Blue Cross Blue Shield is raising rates 62 percent in 2017. In Kentucky, Golden Rule Insurance is boosting rates 47 percet. In Iowa, Wellmark is uping premiums 42 percent, and the list goes on.The government is also hemorrhaging money. So, if you're not getting hit with higher premiums, your tax dollars are certainly getting tacked. Many Republicans say they are still trying to repeal Obamacare but now Democrats are also voicing concerns, the most famous, being the former president. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT: So you've got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have healthcare and then the people are out there busting it sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It's the craziest thing in the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Others think the way to cure what Clinton called the crazy system is to add the public option, an insurance plan offered by the government. You know, kind of like the V.A. And remember in 2009 when President Obama was giving his healthcare speech to a joint session of Congress and when he said the Affordable Care Act would not cover illegal immigrants? South Carolina Congressman Joe Wilson shouted you lie. Well now, California is negotiating with the federal government to have Obamacare cover illegal immigrants. Megyn?KELLY: Well our next guest is known as a key architect of Obamacare and we asked him about this kinds of problems when he visited this show back in the winter of 2013.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Don't you agree the system is going to collapse unless we get those young people -- those young people to sign up and...EZEKIEL EMMANUEL, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS SENIOR FELLOW: No, I don't agree -- I don't agree with that. The president has given you a plan that will cover everyone. So, if your employer decides he can't cover you or won't cover you, you have a safety net where you can get insurance.The exchange going to be a stable way to buy insurance without it going into a death spiral because we don't have enough people in it. That's the key question and the answer to that question is.Going forward is going to be a stable place to buy insurance.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, vice provost for Global Initiatives and Medical Ethics and Health Policy Department chair at the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Ezekiel Emmanuel. Doctor, great to see you again. Thank you for being here. So let's just start with that.EMMANUEL: Nice to be here.KELLY: Stable market. Obviously it is not with this mass exodus of insurance companies, the decrease in competition, the hike -- an enormous hikes in premiums in so many states and counties, were you wrong?EMMANUEL: Megyn, your reporter did a very nice job of cherry picking only the most extreme. They don't raise premiums to cross the board. Some have gone up higher than others but...KELLY: Fifty plus percent.EMMANUEL: The premium hikes are because they came in, they did mis-calibrate the market. They were trying to get market share. And it is a correction and you know, it is a problem that we do need to address. There's no doubt it needs to be addressed. But it is not across the board and on average, we do not have higher than 15 percent increases in the premiums and it is going to be a one-time increase to reflect...KELLY: But the on average business doesn't help the person...EMMANUEL: Wait a second...KELLY: Hold on, but the on average person doesn't help (ph) the person in Arizona County who's got a 51 percent hike in their premiums. The people in Tennessee who have a 62 percent hike in their premiums.EMMANUEL: Again, Megyn, what you are identifying is one product. There are many other products to choose from in those places. So, you can choose...KELLY: In many of these places they only have one insurer. One plan to choose from and one insurance company.EMMANUEL: You can you cherry pick but it's not the only -- it's not the average and it's not going to affect the majority of people.KELLY: But the average doesn't mean anything to the person who is affected by the high cost and by the single insurer.EMMANUEL: The second thing is Republicans bear some of the responsibility for this. Remember, Marco Rubio eliminated some of the risk adjustment that actually buffered and helped the insurance companies in this situation. He took it out of the budget and that was a serious problem.KELLY: OK. But that's about the blame. I'm just talking about problem. OK, so there's plenty of blame it go around but I'm talking about the situation...EMMANUEL: No, no, it's not plenty of blame. It's Republican clamoring...KELLY: You are the architect on the law, sir, OK. So, let's just start with you when I get Marco Rubio here, we'll talk to him. You're the architect. You said that it was going be stable and what we're hearing today from the chief executive of The National Association of Health Underwriters is in many states the individual market is in a shambles. Shambles.EMMANUEL: Megyn, you going to let me finish?KELLY: Go for it.EMMANUEL: OK. One of the things we built into the law was various ways of providing risk corridors and risk adjustment so that insurers would be protected against getting too many sick people which is the heart of the problem. Marco Rubio in the Senate took that away and destabilized the market. When I told you two years ago it was going to be a stable market, those risk protections were in place. And the Republicans took it away. But I may tell you...KELLY: Okay. I get it. So it's Marco Rubio and the Republicans. But let me ask you because the other day we talked about...EMMANUEL: They bear a major responsibility. Are there things we can do, Megyn, let me just finish.KELLY: We talked about the fact that there was a risk --EMMANUEL: Are there things...KELLY: We talked about the fact that there was a real risk that the young people would not sign up that they'd rather pay the penalty. And you said they would sign up. And we talked about -- and you said, look, the very poor people are going to be covered by Medicaid and the next group of people they will sign up. We have that exchange from second sound bite per my control room. Can you play it? Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: What we're being told right now is that young people who you have said in your writings and you acknowledge are critical to the success of this plan, are not signing up. Don't you agree the system is going to collapse unless we get those young people...EMMANUEL: No, I don't agree. I don't agree with that.KELLY: ... those young people to sign up and start paying?EMMANUEL: Let me explain something. First of all, we -- our plan to have people go on Medicaid, about half of the people who are supposed to be covered under 133 percent of the poverty line are supposed to get Medicaid. The people above 133 percent of the poverty are going to get (inaudible) in the exchange.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: OK, but the young people are not signing up. They are choosing instead to pay the penalty, which is a problem. And for those people who are just above that price point where they can get Medicaid, they are not signing up either. The subsidies are not big enough and what we're being told is that they've enrolled only 17 percent of those customers. Only 17 percent of those people who make about 35 grand to 47 grand, only 17 percent signed up.So you still have all these people without insurance. They can't afford it and that's why you're not getting the young people in. You're getting the healthy people in. So my question to you, doctor is, aren't the concerns that we talked about years ago coming to fruition to the detriment of the law and to those who are supposed to have been helped by it.EMMANUEL: Look, we have actually had millions of people -- 11 million people who have come into the exchange, do we need to make adjustments in the interim? After six years we need to see that things need to be changed. We suggested some very simple adjustments that will make sense. First of all, from the time, the penalty is going up so it's actually going to be more real to more people.KELLY: You're going to force them to buy insurance.EMMANUEL: Wait a second, let me finish.KELLY: No, I'm just explaining what you mean by the penalty.EMMANUEL: We have saved a tremendous amount of money actually contrary to what your person said, the federal government is actually been saving -- is projected save between 2014 and 2019 about $1.5 trillion on lower spending. We can deploy some of that money to increase the subsidies and to make them more generous.We could make some adjustments and increase the penalty and take it more seriously for people. These are not major shocks to the system. These are minor adjustments to a system that -- to the Obamacare that will make it more viable.KELLY: I mean, the major shock came back, you know, after 2010 after the law was enacted.EMMANUEL: I would say the most important thing -- the most important thing is to put those risk corridors -- to put those risk corridors back in that Marco Rubio took out. That would actually stabilize things for the companies.KELLY: You know, you say that 11 million people have signed up. You were just on this show a couple years ago saying 34 million people -- 34 million will get coverage. Now it's down to 11. Eleven.EMMANUEL: No, no, no. Get coverage through both Medicaid expansion and the exchanges. Now what happened? We have only 20 million people...KELLY: Eleven million, 8 will million people already had insurance and your number that you're throwing out there, they already had insurance that they liked. They got kicked off of those policies and forced to buy new ones.EMMANUEL: Megyn, no, we did not get 8 million people kicked off. You're now saying an untruth.KELLY: OK, all right.EMMANUEL: We've got 20 million people who got coverage and many more millions -- up to 4 million more people would have gotten coverage if places like Texas and Florida and Georgia would have expanded Medicaid as we wanted in the system. Now, it wasn't the 32 we predicted. But it is 24 million and that's a lot better than the previous system we've had. Remember the previous system...KELLY: And a lot of people were not insured and did get some coverage. I'll give you that one.EMMANUEL: And that's why the American public voted to change it.KELLY: Let's leave it on that happy note where we have some agreement. And listen, despite all these disagreements that we have, I love having you on. You're smart, you know your stuff and you're a stand-up guy.EMMANUEL: But you keep interrupting me, Megyn, so I can't explain my point.KELLY: What it is because you go on and on.EMMANUEL: No, I was just starting.KELLY: I know how to keep you interesting. Trust me, you're in good hands.EMMANUEL: I just know how to start.KELLY: But I got go. Great to see you. Breaking tonight, there are now watches and warnings as far north as North Carolina. And reports that a lot of folks on the ground in Florida are refusing to evacuate. This always happens. As Hurricane Matthew marches toward Florida. We'll update you next.Plus, out of nine major national polls, just one, from the L.A. Times shows Trump beating Clinton in this election. L.A. Times Washington bureau chief David Lauter is here to explain why that is. Don't miss it.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: We're now just 34 days away from electing the next president of the United States. In a series of recent polls show Hillary Clinton gaining ground. But one major survey shows Donald Trump still on top. It comes from a USC Los Angeles Times daily tracking poll. It shows Mr. Trump with a four-point lead over Hillary Clinton.Joining me now, David Lauter, Washington bureau chief at the L.A. Times and Tom Bevan, co-founder and publisher of RealClearPolitics.com, great to see you both. So David, in this poll you found 3,000 people and you just keep tracking samples within that same group. You don't do sort of the random calling that most pollsters do. Why?DAVID LAUTER, LA TIMES: Well one of the big problems that polls have is that when you call the different sample every week or every other week or every month, you never really know whether the people that you're getting from one sample are comparable to the people you actually got before. Maybe one week one side is much more enthusiastic than the other. Maybe something is going really well in the news and they really want to talk.So, you'll have a surge of people who are Democrats for example one week or Republicans another week. And you'll have a poll that bounces around and you never really know is it bouncing around because people are actually changing their minds or because you're just getting different people answering the phone?KELLY: So in this group, in this group of 3,000, were they people who started off Dems or Republicans or undecided? Is that factored in?LAUTER: Oh, sure. It's a balanced mix that's weighted to be representative of the population as a whole. So, you take this group that you've made representative of the population and you go back to them every week and you ask them the same questions in that way you can ensure that when there's a change in the poll, it's an actual person changing their mind rather than just to change and who answers the phone.KELLY: Now, before I get to sound bite, I understand this is an experiment of sorts for you but how confident are you because your poll is of course an outlier.LAUTER: Well, of course, you know, we don't have a crystal ball, right? So you never really know, but this group that is at USC that's doing the poll with us, they did the same technique four years ago, they produced very accurate poll. They were one of the only polls that got president Obama's re-election marching (ph) right.So, we think they are doing a good job. They know what they're doing and you know, there's no guarantee that we're right and other people are wrong. But I think we got a pretty good shot at it.KELLY: There's no guarantee in polling at all...LAUTER: Now, that's right.KELLY: But Tom, what do you make of it because RealClearPolitics, your awesome site has taken heat for including this poll in the average of polls because, you know, that people argue it's an obvious outlier whose methodology is untested except for in one other instance.TOM BEVAN, REALCLEARPOLITICS EXECUTIVE EDITOR: Right. A David said, I mean, the people who are producing this poll did produce -- did do the 2012 election and came out with a very accurate result. And they actually had Obama -- they were on the high side of Obama and margin of victory in that election and that's what it turned out to be so, that's one thing.The other thing is, look, they partnered with a major media organization, the L.A. Times. And the third thing I would say is that, you know look, it's our poll average has anywhere between 8 and 12 polls at any given time. Right now, we have nine polls in there and this is just one of the nine.KELLY: So what do you make of it, Tom, as somebody who aggregates this polls, I mean, how reliable would you say it is? I mean, do you think these are the sort of -- this is the secret Donald Trump victory that nobody's seeing?BEVAN: I wouldn't say that, but look, I'm not willing to just say it's, you know, completely off the board. I mean, just this one example, Megyn, when you have various polls, this one example. We had two polls come out in Ohio this week. One from Quinnipiac that showed Donald Trump up five point and one from Monmouth that showed Hillary Clinton up two points.So, there's a seven-point gap right there. Now, it's a little more pronounced and again, the L.A. Times poll has been more favorable to Trump over a more consistent period of time. But again, you do have variance (ph) with the polls, and again, it's just one poll within a nine poll -- a basket of nine polls that we have in our average at the current time.KELLY: Well yeah, you're hedging your bets but David's way out there and it would be fascinating if he can come back and do a victory lap if they get it right. Great to see you both.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thanks.KELLY: Up next, live to South Carolina as Matthew takes aim.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, unprecedented steps under way ahead of what may be a historic hurricane land fall on the United States. Some anxious drivers filling up their tanks emptying the gas station pumps, and for the first time ever, South Carolina's governor ordering interstate lanes reversed emptying coastal cities. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie live in Charleston, South Carolina for us tonight where residents are bracing for the storm. Jonathan?JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, all of the pumps here at this gas station are shut down. You can see they're surrounded by caution tape. Note on the door here announces that they'll be closed at least through Sunday because this is a low-lying area prone to flooding. One of the areas that is part of the evacuation notice declared earlier today by South Carolina governor Nikki Haley. State officials say there is enough fuel in the supply chain that people don't have to worry about finding gas to fill their cars at other stations.Some of the larger stations have been busier than usual as residents line up to top off their tanks. And when we visited a local supermarket, we found lots of people loading their cars with extra food and water. The manager of a local hardware store told us he got a flood of customers almost immediately after Governor Haley ordered an evacuation of coastal areas in and around Charleston and Beaufort. And to speed up those evacuations, State Highway officials decided to reverse the eastbound lanes of Interstate 26.In other words, all lanes of I-26 are heading westbound away from the coast. If you get in the reverse lanes, you need to make sure you have enough gas to get to Columbia because no exits are permitted along the 100- mile route. Evacuees looking for a hotel may have to drive a bit further going to perhaps Asheville or Charlotte, North Carolina because most of the rooms are taken up here in South Carolina. Megyn, back to you.KELLY: Jonathan Serrie, thank you. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Already getting a lot of reaction to our interview with Dr. Ezekiel Emmanuel which we'll post on our Facebook page. Check it out, facebook.com/thekellyfile. And what do you think of his plan to raise the penalties on the young people who don't sign up? Thanks for watching, everybody. I'm Megyn Kelly.

IT IS FOX NEWS' POLICY THAT CONTRIBUTORS DISCLOSE POSITIONS THEY HOLD IN STOCKS THEY DISCUSS, THOUGH POSITIONS MAY CHANGE. READERS OF ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.'PURGE' POSTING BEFORE BALTIMORE RIOTS SPARKS DEBATE OVER MONITORING SOCIAL MEDIARich Karlgaard: Technology is moving at a fast pace, I think tomorrow will be cameras and drones- this is good. It obscures the larger issue message, the lack of economic growth in this country since the recession and particularly in places like Baltimore has created the conditions for this kind of eruption.Sabrina Schaeffer: They had social media that told the police there would be riots. The fact is this is a form of communication; we can't let this be a distraction from the real story which as Rich points out is why we have these riots and rebellion as some are saying. It's because of a failure of policies and policing in these urban centers.Bruce Japsen: I think it's almost a broader technology question. The cops need to realize they are being monitored on the streets of people who are taping them. They have analysts who are analyzing cyber security. It's a broader technology question that they need to be on top of everything.Steve Forbes: They key thing is how you use social media. You have to be careful, there are a lot of figures of speech- people out there rant and don't act on them. The key thing is judgment.John Tamny: This is a bad idea. It does not speak ill of police to say that they aren't skilled to figure out what is being said and what it means on social media. Baltimore is news because it's so rare. If cops start policing social media, they are going to be arresting people who didn't have violent intent in the first place.Bill Baldwin: I don't want cops spending days whirling around waiting for something to happen on Facebook feeds. What they should be doing is everything possible to give the residents and store owners of the poor owners of the city the same security that the prosperous areas have.NEW CALLS TO SCRAP NUKE TALKS AS IRAN'S SUPREME LEADER BASHES U.S. POLICEBill Baldwin: Some of the things coming out of Iran are troubling, but we have several nations here at the bargaining table here. The sending more troops over there is not an option in my book.Sabrina Schaeffer: Yes, we should stop negotiating. This recent incident, before we have even gotten through the first round of negotiations and Iran has already fired shots- I think we are finding this is making us look weak and incompetent. We need to draw a line in the sand and say no more.Mike Ozanian: The irony is that it took the leader of Iran to call out Obama on his life. The big danger here too is that Obama is cutting back on our military at the time that danger is increasing there. That bodes badly for the US and our allies in the Middle East.Rich Karlgaard: We should walk away. The supreme leader and military is giving us ample reason to do so.  They are not trustworthy and we should walk away.DEMOCRATS' NEW PUSH FOR $12 MINIMUM WAGE SPARKING DEBATE OVER IMPACT ON JOBSSabrina Schaeffer: Artificially manipulating wages is going to be a jobs killer. People who live in poverty, aren't there because of low paying jobs it's because they don't have consistent paid employment.Bruce Japsen: This is a trend that companies are doing anyway. Look at Aetna. These companies get a halo effect, even proposing legislation gives companies a goose to get with the program.John Tamny: It is a cruel thing to impose a minimum wage because some people aren't worth it. Guess who those some people are? The ones with the least amount of work skills.Mike Ozanian: The reason the labor unions like the proposal of raising the minimum wage is because they bargain for their wages based on what the minimum wage is on employees.Steve Forbes: Research shows that people who get the minimum wage after a year are earning more- this is a job killer and will lead to more automation. Pure politics and political issue for 2016.'BUY IN MAY'Mike Ozanian: Vanguard Energy ETFBill Baldwin: Briggs & Stratton"

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone, and happy birthday, America. I'm Eric Bolling along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City. And this is ""The Five.""Welcome to our Proud American Special. We've got a fun show in store for you this Independence Day. It's the 240th birthday of our great nation. We want to thank all the men and women serving in our armed forces along with our living vets and those who have died for our freedom. You make us all so very, very proud to be Americans. On that note, we'd like to share some more of our pride. Let's take you around the table. Who wants to start? Anyone want to start? Greg?GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yeah, OK. I want to say...(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Pride for me is not the right word because I wasn't responsible for the creation of this country. So I would rather say, these are the things that I appreciate and I admire about the country. For example, our plumbing system. If you go to any other country, you will know what I mean. Our lawns are amazing. You don't see lawns like that in China. Costco, you go to Costco, you can buy like a bumper for a car and a toothbrush in aisle 8. We have such great food in this country. It is such great food that even our bad food is better than food, the top cuisine in any other country. Our steaks, try to get a t-bone steak in England that's compared to Texas. Our innovations seamless, Fresh Direct, Uber, incredible innovations, our supermarkets, our Second Amendment, no one has a Second Amendment. We have a Second Amendment. We have guys killing terrorists all over the world. I appreciate that. Our highways are amazing. I have a lot of admiration and appreciation for so many things about America that my head will explode.(CROSSTALK)KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: I think it just did.BOLLING: You forgot one.GUTFELD: What?BOLLING: Our robots.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God!(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Our robots are amazing.GUILFOYLE: And patriotic.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: I support our robots.GUILFOYLE: Our robots are better than their robots.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: That's all that matters.BOLLING: When we're gone...(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: ... the planet's only robots.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: It's really hard to follow that.BOLLING: Yeah, sorry.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Because he had a lot. What I was thinking about today is liberty, and how special that is to be able to live your life however you see fit. And in most places around the world, that is not the case. Our founding fathers had such foresight as to set up a government, so that we could try to be the best country in the world, which we have been. And I think that will continue because their foresight from many years ago. And it is amazing, they were young then, relatively young men, but they put it all together. Juan knows that, he wrote a book about it. But I will say liberty, the ability to live freely. And I feel like we have a responsibility to help others in the world do the same.GUILFOYLE: And there she is, Lady Liberty.GUTFELD: Yes. An incredible likeness of the statue of liberty purchased for $3 right around the corner.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Our producers do not hold back.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: They knew we were doing this show and they said, let's go get a replica of the Statue of Liberty. This is it.BOLLING: Excellent.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: And Mr. Juan Williams, why are you a proud American?GUILFOYLE: And look at his tie.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: You know what I like? Sea to shining sea.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Amber waves of grain?WILLIAMS: Well, that's part of it because when you fly over, you see some amazing things. I mean, to see the grand canyon from above, unbelievable. Unbelievable. But also to go over the continental divide when you're going into your favorite state, Colorado, that's really amazing -- wow, look at this. There are snow-capped mountains. That song is for real. And you go out to the far northwest, I had no idea because I'm a kid from Brooklyn. But you can see the grain wave with the wind. I mean, the grain -- it is called (inaudible) because it has all different kinds of oats and wheat and grains. I think wow, this is America. And of course, if you go up to Alaska and over to Hawaii, it's unbelievable, what a country.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: The other thing, too, is you can also just watch a movie instead.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: There are so many great movies on the airlines these days.GUILFOYLE: And we do like the movies.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: You would tell me, Juan, close the window. I'm trying to watch the movie.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: All right, proud American, K.G.GUILFOYLE: I think you know why I'm most proud as an American. I salute the troops. And I salute the veterans and the people who serve this country, that defend our liberty, that we treasure and value so much. And when you think about this recent time, the number of deployments that families have been asked to really put it all on the line and make tremendous sacrifices, the children, the wives, the family members, the parents at home, while they go to serve faithfully. Some of them have been deployed, eight, nine times, especially our Special Forces groups as well. Really, I think about that sacrifice and how lucky we are every day to go from Monday to Tuesday to Wednesday, and be able to sleep well at night knowing they're defending all the values that we care about. So I just want to give special thanks for that.BOLLING: I'll join in on all of your thoughts as well. Can I just add law enforcement? I know it's Independence Day, but they risk their lives every day for our freedoms, protecting the freedoms that were gained through our military. So thank you to them. All right. We'll bring it around this way now. Your favorite way to celebrate the Fourth of July.GUILFOYLE: Well, OK. You know there's food involved. And I hearken back to a time when we had a nice Fourth of July festivities. And of course, you know, I like the chicken wings. I am a self-proclaimed chicken wing champion.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: It is not self-proclaimed, you are.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Actually, really, yeah. It's on YouTube. And for those of you who will now look at it on YouTube, that is in real-time. It is not sped up like a velociraptor where I'm eating two at a time.(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: No, but the aftermath of some of that was edited out for obvious reasons.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Some of it was. Not mine. But the second place finisher didn't fare so well. And I got back in the line to get second helpings. Heart of a champion.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: So, Juan, How do you celebrate -- your favorite way to celebrate?WILLIAMS: Fireworks. I'm a big fireworks guy. And I love fireworks so much, you know, I think the best I've ever seen actually was Boston. You know, you go right down, right down there by the river and Arthur Fiedler was there alive at the time, Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops. Just unbelievable. If you go to Philadelphia, Independence Hall on Fourth of July, that's a very special place. Unbelievable celebration. And, of course, I live in Washington, D.C. Last year, I went on top of the Canadian Embassy and watched the fireworks over the National Mall of America.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Traitor.WILLIAMS: That's right.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Fourth of July, you go to Canada's Embassy.WILLIAMS: Yeah. You know what, it's right there. I guess is that constitution, Dana?(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Yeah.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Kind of the intersection. But it's right next to the Newseum. And it has got a great site for watching the fireworks.BOLLING: Dana, your thoughts on favorite way to celebrate the Fourth.PERINO: Well, I'm like family, family, family, friends if you can. And I think it's a great holiday, I love summertime, of course. One of the things that I love is where we've been spending some time in South Carolina is there's a parade in the morning. I've not been able to go because of work and things, but there's a morning parade and dogs are involved in the parade, and there's a contest and a theme. And Peter takes the Harley and (inaudible) rides in the side car. And the first year they won. The second year, they didn't.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh, the victory.BOLLING: Greg?(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Well, no. I celebrate the fourth with a fifth.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: But you know my favorite thing about July 4th so far? Potato salad. It's incredibly important because you have to get the right measure of mayonnaise and egg and potatoes. People who put celery in potato salad, that's disgusting and wrong.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: No, no, no, no, no, no. You don't put crunchy in the potato salad. You save the crunchy for your macaroni.PERINO: What, no.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: It has to be creamy. You leave it out, it turns yellow.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: It is mac and cheese.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: What's crunchy in it?(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: But you don't put celery in potato salad.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: You would be worried about potato salad going bad at these picnics.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: I have a bad feeling for your stomach. Let me tell you, mayonnaise in the sun.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Oh, it's amazing. My dog hates that.GUTFELD: Illegal fireworks.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: We have lost the art of illegal fireworks, barrel bombs, bottle rockets, M-80, the cherry bombs.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: In toilets.WILLIAMS: I don't know where you live, but they certainly haven't lost it in my neighborhood.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: We have one more we'll start from the inside out. Dana, your favorite Fourth of July memory, your favorite one.PERINO: So I couldn't think of one. And then I was walking here, and I was like oh, my gosh, I have one that kind of ties together. So I remember that when I was seven years old, I had a chance to go to the White House with my parents. My dad had a conference in Washington, D.C., and that was the day when your spouse got to go with you on the business trip. So I got to go as well. My sister had to stay at home. I got to go to the White House because my mom's friend worked in the scheduling office for Air Force One for Jimmy Carter. So we got a tour and everything. We visited Lincoln's Museum, and everything, Memorial and the War Museum.BOLLING: Right.PERINO: So then, we're leaving -- and I remember this. I asked my dad. Is this a real memory or just something I imagined? No, it was real. We flew out in the dark on the Fourth of July and outside my window -- thankfully, I could have the window open, no movies. I saw the fireworks over the Washington Monument. I remember feeling so excited about that, it's a flash in my memory. And then several years later, I was able to be on the White House lawn, the south lawn, watching it, usually waiting for North Korea to set off a test of nuclear weapons, so we'd have to work all night. But for those moments that I got to watch the fireworks over the Washington Monument, those were great.BOLLING: Mr. Juan.GUILFOYLE: That's pretty cool.PERINO: Yeah.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Well, I have two that stand out. One is I got married on July 1st. I remember my wife and I just went off to a little cafe.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Cafe?WILLIAMS: Yeah, cafe, like you know a restaurant. And we're sitting outside, we're going to go get up and watch the fireworks at the mall. But we just kept eating and people kept coming over and saying hello.GUILFOYLE: Is that after you got married?WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: You just walked down the street.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: So you got married and walked down the street to the cafe?WILLIAMS: No, no, no. We got married July 1st.GUILFOYLE: And then?WILLIAMS: This is July 4th.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: So we were just kind of eating and all of a sudden there were fireworks. And gee, we missed the fireworks, we were having such a good time. And the other one I remember...PERINO: Fireworks at the table.GUTFELD: And in the bedroom.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: But you know what, you know the movie Independence Day?BOLLING: Yes.WILLIAMS: I remember taking the kids to go see the midnight showing. So it was from July 3rd to the morning of July 4th, midnight showing. And we had such a great time. I mean, that was the first Independence Day movie, I hear the second one is not too good.BOLLING: That's 20 years ago, right?WILLIAMS: Yeah. That's the 20th?(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: OK.GUTFELD: What I have is a -- it's an amalgam of memories that happen over time which as a child going to buy the giant box of fireworks. You go with your dad. You show up, you always wanted the giant box. And there were all these weird things like the little snakes. Those things are great. And then my favorite is the stinky bucket. You know at the end of the night, you always have a stinky bucket because you have water in there and you're throwing the Roman candle into the bucket and it creates that amazing stinky smell. Then you hear the next day, it's a great smell. And then you hear the next day one of your neighbors blew a thumb off, and now he's really cool.BOLLING: Or a giant football player.GUTFELD: Yes, that's right.GUILFOYLE: Or the fire department comes because they want to investigate your leftover fireworks.GUTFELD: That happened to you, I bet.GUILFOYLE: A hundred percent.GUTFELD: And that wasn't even on Fourth of July.GUILFOYLE: I blame my brother.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Exactly. We'd like to see your fireworks from last summer. My favorite memory? OK. So, I love the Fourth of July parade. I think they're so fun. But you see all the kids and everybody's really excited and really kind of brings it home remembering what this great country that we live in. So in particular in the Hamptons and Sag Harbor and Southampton, they do a phenomenal parade. I think it is very similar to what Dana was talking about, that has a sense of nostalgia and it brings you back to another time. It is like very traditional kind of old fashioned. It's nice to see everybody get together and kind of like...PERINO: Do they still throw candy?GUILFOYLE: Do they still throw candy, I didn't get any candy. But I'd like to go to one.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: That's a micro-aggression.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, now people like to -- they usually get hit in the eye or something.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: My favorite Fourth of July is this one because, as we sit here, I had just gotten back from a couple of days with my son before he goes off to college. And we spent two days together in Florida, and it's amazing. All right. We'll leave it right there.Ahead, highlights and lowlights from this year's epic election season, plus a preview of the road trip conventions. As we head to break, here's retired Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Peters sharing his pride for this great country. We'll be right back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RALPH PETERS, RETIRED LIEUTENANT COLONEL: I was a young enlisted soldier in Germany, 1977. And on a weekend pass, I took the train down to Munich, lovely city. And in spite the gray, squally weather, I walked around, saw the sights, then I took the commuter train out to Dachau to the Concentration Camp Museum. I was alone on that gray March or early April day. I went indoors to a little museum and looked at the photographs of what humans can do one another. Then I turned a corner in the exhibit, and there were these black and white photographs of GIs liberating Dachau concentration camp. And on those young GIs, the faces you saw astonishment and on the faces of the inmates. I looked at those photos and I thought, God, that's who we are, Americans, that's what we do.ANNOUNCER: Share your pride on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, #proudAmerican.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: It's been a long presidential election cycle, hasn't it? But we are in the home stretch. The GOP convention gets under way in two weeks in Cleveland. We'll be taking a road trip there. And we're also going to the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia. More on that in a moment.But first, let's take a little trip down memory lane and revisit some of the highlights and, well, low lights from the campaign trail this season starting with Gregory.GUTFELD: I wonder if anybody actually lives on Memory Lane?(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: That would be pretty funny.WILLIAMS: How about Penny Lane?(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Remember my Aunt Patty Sue...GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: Now, it is called Memory Lane.GUTFELD: Oh, excellent.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: It is a great story. We'll have that edited out later. My high point was recent. If you remember, Donald Trump speaking earlier, this is an amazing development. He's showing right then and there how he's going to solve two major problems, illegal immigration and cleaning up the environment. He's going to build a massive wall out of trash. This is the solution.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: He's going to be -- you can't climb that. Who would want to touch that wall? This is the answer that we've been waiting for. And this is cheap. It practically pays for itself.PERINO: And you say you want specifics.WILLIAMS: I think that was a recycling center. But I get the idea.GUTFELD: You know what, I don't really like recycling.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Because it doesn't pay.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: It doesn't pay.WILLIAMS: It doesn't pay.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: OK, mine, it is something I could have related to the problem that Hillary Clinton had when she tried to use the subway like regular people, but still, this video is hilarious.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Hillary Clinton is wanting to be just like the people. And it takes her like four tries to use her subway card. It's not easy all the time. You got to just hit it just right.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: I would get so angry if I was behind her because I'd miss my train.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: You have to be ready to go and know you're doing.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: So Bernie Sanders is a guy from Brooklyn and Donald Trump a guy from Queens. You think they would have done better?PERINO: No, I don't think anyone rides the subway but me.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: I ride the subway every day.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: All right. Dr. Bolling.BOLLING: Me? So the one I would pick was -- they said pick a highlight and lowlight. So I picked one that was both. It was a highlight for all of us and a lowlight for the media. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There she goes and Secret Service following behind her. OK. They're going around to the back. You can see the media running behind me here to chase the Scooby van, when she's going around to the back.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wow.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And we'll see her very soon.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The guy in the orange pants is pretty quick. Alex, I'm looking at these people. Wow.(END VIDEO CLIP)(CROSSTALK)PERINO: That's funny.GUTFELD: They look like they just looted a Best Buy.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: That was like the MSNBC parking lot.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Kimberly, you're up.GUILFOYLE: The Scooby snack. OK, one of the highlights for me was Super- Tuesday. And if you recall, the Trump Florida speech, it was pretty amazing. I haven't seen anything like it. It was like victory speech, a news conference, and also it was like the infomercial, the Trump steaks and everything.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The single-biggest story in politics today, it's what's happening at the booth, the tremendous number of people that are coming out to vote. We have Democrats coming over, very importantly, we have independents coming over. We have people come over here who have never voted Republican, who have never even thought about it, and they came and they voted Republican.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: And then, of course, followed up by Trump steaks on display. And you can buy them.GUTFELD: Water.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh, Trump water.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: And then, there was a trip to Scotland, to his golf course. You could go play on his golf course. This is all because Romney said he really wasn't that successful. That's a great response. I thought it was effective.GUILFOYLE: I think so. OK. He won you over. I see this.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: He certainly won me over. I thought, boy, you couldn't beat a display of ego like that. That's unbelievable. That's American.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Winning.WILLIAMS: All right. So here's my favorite moment because you know doing politics all the year, I was amazed that this guy was able to say what he said and that people didn't go crazy. Here it is. Donald trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: John McCain goes, oh, boy, Trump makes my life difficult. He had 15,000 crazies show up, crazies. He called them all crazies. He's not a war hero.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Wow. Now, to me, that was like, wow, I think that would sink your -- did not sink him. In fact, Donald Trump has become the Republican nominee. I think we're going to remember that one for a long time. Would you agree?PERINO: I agree.GUTFELD: It's the worst thing I've ever heard a politician say.WILLIAMS: The worst?GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: Or an American.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: What do you think?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: I think it's Independence Day, it's July 4th.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: we'll be celebrating the military today and thanking them for everything they've done.PERINO: Including John McCain.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: John McCain, a fantastic American hero. Also, I think we'll have to do like a post tape of this when we do our whole convention because I bet you that's where the highlights and some lowlights from Greg are going to appear.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: I'm going to get some highlights while I'm on the bus. Go a little blond.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Is hair and makeup coming? Will they be on the bus?(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: They'll be there. There's the bus. Take a look. Feast your eyes on that.

Americans are taking less vacation than ever before when they have -- yes, when they have time off to take? So why is that? Is your life all work and no play? Coming back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS: I'm Doug McKelway in Washington. Here are the headlines. In New York, 3 million people are expected to celebrate Independence Day watching the nation's largest pyrotechnic display. And security will be tight. While authorities say there is new credible threat to the U.S. today, the NYPD plans to have counterterrorism units, boats and a lot of manpower helping people enjoy the show.In Iraq at least 157 people are dead from a truck bombing in Baghdad. That was the country's worst attack in more than a decade. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack in a busy commercial center over the weekend.And the Fourth begins a busy week for the presidential candidates. The GOP presumptive nominee Donald trump met with Iowa Senator Joni Ernst today, who some believe is on the vice-presidential shortlist. Hillary Clinton spent more than three hours talking to the FBI on Saturday about her email set-up. Tuesday, she campaigns with President Obama.Please join me at 6:00 PM Eastern for a special report. Now back to THE FIVE.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: It's summertime. Have you made your vacation plans? You've worked hard. You've earned it. But millions of Americans aren't using all their paid vacation days each year. That's according to the U.S. Labor Department.There's a term to describe some of them. Work martyrs. Are you one of those?Lots of employees aren't taking time, because they say they feel guilty or they want to show their dedication, or they don't want to be seen as replaceable. Others take vacation but end up working while they're on it. Of course, that could lead to a fight, family fight. Believe me.Greg, you are the kind of person that you are stressed when you haven't had a vacation, but when you go on vacation and you're stressed while you're there about not being here because of all the work that's piling up?GUTFELD: No, it's not -- I just don't like travel. I mean, I like to be - - OK, I have this idea...PERINO: Like being places, not going places?GUTFELD: Did I pitch this idea before? There should be a travel company that comes to your house, and then they -- they shoot you with a drug that knocks you out. And they put you in a -- like on a cot. They put you in an ambulance, and they take you to the airport. They put you on the plane, and then the next thing you know, you wake up in the hotel.So the moment that you book your -- you book your flight, they show up, knock you out; and they take you there. That -- then I would love vacations, but other the all stuff...GUILFOYLE: It's called Fantasy Island.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Why don't you get little -- Mr. Rourke and Tattoo? You guys could share clothes.GUTFELD: Tattoo was...PERINO: Aw.GUTFELD: Tattoo was awesome.BOLLING: That's a pretty cool idea.GUTFELD: Yes. The idea of, like, being on...PERINO: Because you don't like to travel. You don't like the anxiety of having to get somewhere.GUTFELD: Knock me out.GUILFOYLE: That's why you're not going to be good to go to, like, Bali or Bora Bora.BOLLING: Or Cleveland.GUTFELD: Or Cleveland.GUILFOYLE: Or even Cleveland on a bus.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: Kimberly, you like to take vacations?GUILFOYLE: No.PERINO: I know. You don't, really?GUILFOYLE: No.GUTFELD: Your life's a vacation.GUILFOYLE: Because -- well, it's pretty awesome. But the thing is sometimes then we go on vacation -- true story, because you know, every time I go to Mexico, I get proposed to. What?PERINO: No, but remember the last vacation you had, didn't you...GUILFOYLE: Oh, yes, that was (SPEAKING SPANISH).So then I ended up with the mosquitoes. I'm big in the insect community. And all these bug bites, and I'm convinced I have, like, Zika or anything. And then, because I've been kickboxing and I had a hematoma in my leg and it like swelled up. And I had to stay inside with my leg up in the air. And it was just like -- I'm like, what am I even doing?GUTFELD: Just one.PERINO: Juan. Juan -- Juan, Juan.WILLIAMS: You're killing me here.PERINO: Juan, you like to take a vacation, right? You like to go to Puerto Rico.WILLIAMS: Oh, no, I like vacations, but the thing is, after a day or two, I'm, like, so itchy that I bother people.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.WILLIAMS: Because everybody is like, well -- I feel like why are we here? What are we doing? I need something...PERINO: You can't just sit and chill?GUILFOYLE: You're, like, anxious not actually itchy.GUTFELD: Yes. I'm that way.WILLIAMS: I get.GUILFOYLE: Yes, yes, yes.WILLIAMS: Yes, yes, yes. So -- so it gets weird. And then, you know what? If I get past it, if I get to, like, day five, then I kind of get into the mode.GUTFELD: You've got to go.GUILFOYLE: But then it's time to go home.WILLIAMS: But that's time to go home.GUILFOYLE: So true, so true.WILLIAMS: But I am struck by the idea that Americans take so few. I think it's -- you know, we don't -- we -- on average we earn about 20, and we retake about 16. And you go to -- people, like, oddly in a hotel; and there will be people from Germany and France. And they get months off.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: I don't know what the deal is over there. But they're always on vacation.GUTFELD: That's why we're better.PERINO: The world economy could use a little more worky-worky.GUILFOYLE: I have a year of, like, unused vacation. Isn't that so...PERINO: Do you remember, Eric, when -- was it you that we did the -- I advised you to do the e-mail bankruptcy.BOLLING: Yes, that was great.PERINO: When you came back from -- I think you went away and you came back, and there were so many e-mails.BOLLING: It's overwhelming.PERINO: One of the reasons people say they don't like to go away.BOLLING: I met Juan Williams for the very first time in Puerto Rico...WILLIAMS: In a hot tub.BOLLING: ... in a hot tub.WILLIAMS: It's a fact.

Anyway.GUTFELD: I like a staycation.PERINO: Take a vacation, people. You need to refresh your mind and your body, and then you'll be a better worker.Ahead, we asked you to send in your Fourth of July related questions. We're going to answer them when we come back.GUILFOYLE: By the way, we sound...(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(MUSIC: THEME FROM ""THE FLINTSTONES"")GUTFELD: It's the Fourth of July, and it's also Social Media Monday here on ""The Five.""

And everybody had gone to the pool.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: And I never got to go sit at the pool. Well, so last summer and now this summer, if I have a chance, I actually really love to just go and sit by the pool and just hang out. I don't even take anything to read.GUTFELD: Oh, my gosh, Dana!PERINO: I just chat.GUTFELD: Wow, you're one of those weirdos. OK.GUILFOYLE: Doesn't read.PERINO: Yes. So I like to sit by the pool.

Eric.GUILFOYLE: Eww!BOLLING: Oh, come on.PERINO: As long as you don't pee in it.GUILFOYLE: What's wrong with you?BOLLING: All right. My guilty pleasure in the summertime, and maybe...GUILFOYLE: Freak.BOLLING: ... in wintertime also, it's two rums. It's -- it's Malibu rum. It's also a Caribbean rum.

And then sometimes they have fireflies, and the little kids are wandering around. It's just like, you know, time just flies by. It's unbelievable. And sometimes somebody will have a ball game on on the radio in the background, and some kid is sitting there, making out with his girlfriend in the car. And you think, this is life.PERINO: I don't like that.GUILFOYLE: Wait, Juan, you like watching people making out?WILLIAMS: Every -- I mean, you're sitting on the porch; and the world is going by and everything is happening.PERINO: Aww.BOLLING: Cigar?WILLIAMS: Me, I like cigars.

Well, I mean, you know what I like.GUTFELD: Yes, I know what you like.PERINO; Salami.GUILFOYLE: Well, besides salami. Yes.GUTFELD: Controlled water.GUILFOYLE: I like to actually have some snacks. Not really supposed to do this. Maybe it's a little on the wild side. But you're not supposed to really eat in the hot tub, but I think if you just have a few light snacks, a little salami and cheese with a nice drink and you're in the hot tub, that's particularly enjoyable. Or the outdoor shower is also quite nice.GUTFELD: Yes, yes.GUILFOYLE: Or the indoor bathtub Jacuzzi...PERINO: Shower?GUILFOYLE: ... quite nice, followed up by the indoor shower.GUTFELD: Very good.PERINO: That's a lot of water.GUILFOYLE: I love it.

That clicking noise, by the way, just ignore it.BOLLING: I thought you were going somewhere else. Salami, hot tubs. OK.GUTFELD: My -- my guilty pleasure in the summer is I love to go for long drives. And you know, if there are any hitchhikers, because you know, they've been out there for a long time, I often just pick them up. And...PERINO: There's no hitchhikers anymore.GUTFELD: I know.WILLIAMS: Oh, my God.GUILFOYLE: You're like an episode of ""America's Most Wanted.""GUTFELD: Unwanted.GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: All right.

Who did I know beforehand? Well, Juan I knew from being here, because he's been on the air and, you know, watched him for years. And then we met when you were here.And then Bolling I knew because we were doing ""Strategy Room"" and everything together. So that was super fun. And I used to do his show, ""Follow the Money.""Dana I met before.PERINO: A little bit.GUILFOYLE: We worked together, yes, which was nice. And we were talking about some people we knew in common in politics and the whole thing. So we liked each other right away.PERINO: And you defended Peter when he was -- remember, when he got arrested...GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: ... walking the dog off a leash. And it was on ""Is It Legal?""GUILFOYLE: Yes, ""Is It Legal?"" Had to defend.GUTFELD: Is it beagle.GUILFOYLE: That's right. Right. There you go.PERINO: That's before we met.GUILFOYLE: Free counsel.

I think that's right.PERINO: Love him.WILLIAMS: And Tony was a good friend who used to work here at FOX. Those of you remember ""FOX News Sunday,"" he was the host, and then went to be the White House press secretary. And I believe -- what did you -- did he hire you?PERINO: No, he inherited me.WILLIAMS: He inherited you?PERINO: I was already there.WILLIAMS: OK.PERINO: I was a lifer.WILLIAMS: Yes, and Tony was not only a good friend but a good -- And I don't remember how we met.GUTFELD: I knew who you were, but we never met.WILLIAMS: Because I'm not a -- I need to be a funnier guy.

Gee whiz, sorry about that.WILLIAMS: Wait a second, I'm interested. How did you meet Dana Perino?GUTFELD: That's the funny thing. Out of everybody here, I didn't know her.

Zuriel Ferguson.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ZURIEL FERGUSON, FILMMAKER (voice-over): The United States Constitution, the foundation for which structure and further establishments will be built on. Take a look at this building.(on camera): Before the construction of this building could ever take place, first there had to have been a strong foundation laid. It's quite like the U.S. Constitution.In 1787, the U.S. Constitution was conceived to set rules and project goals as the basis of the American government.Being able to live in today's society is pretty cool. But having the freedom to express yourself more than 200 years ago is even cooler.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: So Zuriel Ferguson, that's -- he's going to be here in July. Constituting America is going to bring some winners here to ""The Five.""GUILFOYLE: That was fantastic.PERINO: They all found out about it because of ""The Five.""GUILFOYLE: I love it.

Foreigners like to date Americans...PERINO: Wait, what?WILLIAMS: ... because they think we are more fun, more attractive, and especially American men. Foreigners find us low maintenance, more chivalrous, as well as respectful of the opposite sex. So go, American men.PERINO: Wow.GUILFOYLE: My God. That was out of left field.PERINO: That's a virtue. That's a virtue of manliness.BOLLING: That is so -- that is so nationalistic of you.WILLIAMS: Chauvinistic.PERINO: It's one of the virtues. Manliness.BOLLING: This is my ""One More Thing."" I want to thank everyone. The out -- the unbelievable...GUILFOYLE: Response?BOLLING: ... response to what's going on with the book. Thank you so much.
