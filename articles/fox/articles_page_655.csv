1	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/07/13/bill-oreilly-funeral-kate-steinle/	Bill O'Reilly: The funeral of Kate Steinle	"Today, the Steinle family buried their 32-year-old daughter in San Francisco. The media was barred from the ceremony as it should have been. The situation is heart-breaking.Imagine if Kate were your daughter and her life was taken by a despicable criminal who had been deported to Mexico five times. Just imagine that.I have the same feeling I had when I heard that nine innocent people were gunned down by a racist in Charleston. These things should never happen in the United States of America. In the Charleston situation Americans came together condemning the blatant hatred.But in Kate's situation Americans have not come together, at least so far. That's because of politics. There is no question the uber-liberal sanctuary city policy of San Francisco directly led to the murder of Kate Steinle. If the city leaders had any shame, which they don't, they would have resigned already.It struck me yesterday when Jesse Watters confronted the 11 San Francisco supervisors how emotionless they are. And, of course, none of them have the courage to address the situation. Mayor Ed Lee blaming the hapless sheriff who is so incompetent it's painful. Imagine a law enforcement officer allowing a seven-time felon out on the street when the feds directly asked him to keep the man in custody? The sheriff is a disgrace. But even more disgraceful is the non-action out of Washington.The alleged killer 45-year-old Juan Francisco Sanchez is a drug pusher and addict,. a low level thug who managed to enter America illegally six times. That means anyone in the world can sneak into this country. That low life illegally crossed our border from Mexico six times? We don't have border enforcement. Does everybody understand that?Now, I'm very proud of the more than 200,000 folks who have signed the petition on BillOReilly.com calling for Kate's Law, which would incarcerate any deported felon who returns to America again. There would be mandatory five-year sentences for felons and lesser sentences for those committing misdemeanors who are deported and come back.It's shocking. Some Americans will not support Kate's Law. But you know the story. Ideology more important to some people than public safety. However I do believe Congress will pass the law and we will track it every step of the way.Finally a message to Kate Steinle's family on the day of her funeral. America let you down. Kate was a vibrant, loving person, a generous American of whom we are all proud. The fact that she is no longer with us tonight is a travesty.And that's ""The Memo"".Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years.

4	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/07/06/bill-oreilly-no-prosecution-hillary-clinton/	Bill O'Reilly: No prosecution of Hillary Clinton	"Earlier today, FBI Director James Comey read a long statement regarding the investigation of Hillary Clinton's email and National Security.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)COMEY: We cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of clearly intentional and willful miss handling of classified information or vast quantities of information, exposed in such a way to support an inference of intentional misconduct or indications of disloyalty to the United States or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Mr. Comey was clear in his motivation statement but downplayed the negligence aspect of the case. Here's a quote from the federal code. ""Whoever being entrusted with national security documents through gross negligence permits the same to be removed its proper police custody shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years or both."" Gross negligence in handling national security is a felony.FOX News investigated the statute and found only one case prosecuted under it in 1986. But negligence charges were subsequently dismissed. So, to be fair, Director Comey has legal history on his side. But that will not allay suspicions that the case was decided on politics.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)COMEY: What I can assure the American people is that in this investigation was done honestly competently and independently, no outside influence of any kind was brought to bear.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Now, you either believe Director Comey or you don't. And no amount of speculation is going to shed more light on his posture. He says the investigation was clean and that's that. In his remarks today, Comey also scolded Secretary Clinton in a way that has been rarely scene.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)COMEY: Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive highly classified information. For example, seven email chains concerned matters that were classified at the top secret, special access program at the time they were sent and received. There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position or in the position of those with whom she was corresponding about those matters should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation.None of these emails should have been on any kind of unclassified system. But their presence is especially concerning because all of these emails were housed on unclassified personal servers, not even supported by full- time security staff. We also assess that Secretary Clinton's use of a personal email domain was both known by large number of people and readily apparent. She also used her personal email extensively while outside the United States including sending and receiving work related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. Given that combination of factors. We asses it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal email account.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Again, those statements are almost unprecedented. And they go directly to the presidential election. Combined with the chaos in Benghazi, Libya, where the American ambassador was murdered. The FBI's criticism of Hillary Clinton is withering. You have would think Americans would want to elect a person with a record of competency, would you not? So, that gives Donald Trump a big opening. Because compared to questions about his competency, the email caves blows out right out of the water. I mean, Trump University? Come on.No matter what happens there, it doesn't come close to the FBI scrutiny of Hillary Clinton's email situation. Now, many who support Mrs. Clinton simply don't care. They believe she is better for the country than Donald Trump so issues really don't matter. Same thing on the other side. Millions of Americans have already convicted Mrs. Clinton on many, many things. They will never vote for her. Talking points is in the business of informing and at times reforming. The negligence thing bothers me. It bothers me.Even if there were no intent to subvert Federal Law. The subversion happened. And Secretary Clinton is directly responsible for that. If you the American citizen leave a child in a hot car and that child was harmed by that you will be charged with negligence even if your action was unintentional. Many analysts have pointed to General David Petraeus who was convicted for a misdemeanor for providing a close friend, national security secrets, so she could use them in a book. The difference is, Petraeus obviously new that he was going something subverting.He had intent. One footnote, if I were a president, I would have pardoned David Petraeus because his service to this country far outweighs his reaction as responsible as it was. So, by minimizing the negligence issue in the Clinton case, Director Comey puts his entire agency under scrutiny. I'm not casting aspersions on Comey's honesty. I believe he is a credible man. I don't believe he would tank an investigation. But the American people, you, are owed a more detailed explanation about negligence that put our national security in jeopardy.Now, to the bigger election picture, throughout our history, we have elected presidents who had not been honest man. Warren Harding, Richard Nixon, to some extent, Lyndon Johnson just to name a few. It is up to each voter to evaluate honesty and competency in a factual, therefore fair way. Finally, it is more than likely that the FBI tipped off President Obama as to what was going to happen today. That's not to say that Director Comey was working with the President. But the bureau knew Mr. Obama was allowing Hillary Clinton to ride on Air Force One to a campaign event in North Carolina this afternoon. So, it is inconceivable that the director of the FBI and Attorney General Loretta Lynch would allow that to happen if Hillary Clinton was going to be charged. Director Comey addressed that today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)COMEY: I have not coordinated this statement or reviewed it in any way with the Department of Justice or any other part of the government. They do not know what I'm about to say.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: That's most likely true. He didn't expose his statement, his words. But just by its silence, the FBI sent a message that President Obama read it clearly. That's how things are done in Washington. Summing up, the FBI says lack of intent to subvert federal law is the reason the agency is not recommending charges against Hillary Clinton. But Director Comey downplayed the negligence issue and that is very troubling. And that's ""The Memo"".Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years.
