This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" October 19, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)IVANKA TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S DAUGHTER: I was going crazy around a year ago calling these reporters, trying to get them to at least hear our perspective. And it's just a waste of time. You fall down such a rabbit hole with this and it doesn't yield a result. But to your point, he's either win or he won't win. And I believe he will accept the outcome either way.TIM KAINE, DEMOCRATIC VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We ought to win big because we know Donald Trump is going to be a big whiner when this thing is over. I mean, this is schoolyard bully stuff. The big bully who is so tough, and then the first time you stand up to him, it's whine, whine, whine, whine, whine.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Tim Kaine and Ivanka Trump talking about the coverage of this race. Let's bring in our panel: Steve Hayes, senior writer for The Weekly Standard; Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National Public Radio; Monica Crowley, editor and columnist for The Washington Times, and Ed O'Keefe, reporter with The Washington Post.OK, Monica, we look at the average of polls, the recent polls, ""Special Report"" average. It's at Clinton is at 8.6 as you head into this debate.MONICA CROWLEY, THE WASHINGTON TIMES: Yes, the polling has been going in one direction. It has all been trending toward Mrs. Clinton over the last several weeks. And, you know, despite what Donald Trump is saying and what his campaign I think maybe believes, all of the polls can't be wrong. So certainly he has taken significant hits over the last couple of weeks.This is his last chance to reset this campaign and try to regain the momentum. He has to make it tonight not about himself. He should avoid talking about himself at all costs, even when he is asked about himself, and make this about the American people and the future of the country, which was the entire rational for getting into this race to begin with.MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS: He knows all that, Steve, right? He is not -- Donald Trump is not a dumb man. And he has been advised that many times by very smart people. But he does what he wants to do. What we have seen on the campaign recently is constantly off message, constantly going after the media, going after Republicans, and not focusing on Hillary.STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Right.KELLY: So what do you expect he's going to do tonight?HAYES: Exactly what you just described. I think there's no question having spoken to people who have been advising him, there's no question that's what they are emphasizing. Monica is exactly right. That's what Donald Trump needs to do.And there's so much to be said right now. There's probably not a better time in recent memory to be making a case on behalf of limited government when you look at what's happened over the past eight years, whether you talk about the failed stimulus and economic stagnation or you're talking about Obamacare or you're talking about the Iran deal. This is a great case to make. He is not making it. He is instead going after Paul Ryan, going after Republicans, talking about himself. And he seems totally incapable of just deflecting a question or an attack and turning it back to Hillary Clinton.BAIER: Although he was better at the second debate than he was at the first debate doing that.HAYES: We're grading on a curve.BAIER: All right, Mara, set the table for us.MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Look, I think what we have seen over the last couple weeks is that Donald Trump's ceiling and his floor are starting to converge. He is just bouncing around in the high 30s, low 40s range. And it seems like what he has done in the last couple weeks is just focus on energizing his own base, not doing anything to try to grow his vote.And there's a reason that when you type the words ""is Donald Trump trying"" into your Google search bar, it comes up ""to lose the election,"" because the strategy is inexplicable.And I do think he should get back to that powerful message he had, anti- establishment message on the economy, terrorism, and immigration and trade. He has gotten off of that. He has gotten -- he struck to an anti- establishment message, but it's been all about conspiracy theory.KELLY: Meantime, Trump has been complaining about the media. If you look at the coverage of his -- the sexual assault allegations against him versus the media coverage of the WikiLeaks revelations, there's no question that it has been three to one at least Donald Trump negative news for him versus what we have seen on WikiLeaks. And you tell me why that is. Is it media bias or is it media laziness that they have to go through 10,000 and 10,000, and 10,000 e-mails?ED O'KEEFE, THE WASHINGTON POST: Thanks, Megyn.(LAUGHTER)O'KEEFE: There's video of Trump's problems, and there's thousands of pages of e-mails of hers. And we have been going through them. I spent two days last week reading through them. And we found interesting things. But frankly, all it really does is confirm or validate a lot of the assumptions and things we have known about her campaign and the way it operates. It takes 12 people to write a joke, 11 to write a tweet, or maybe it's the other around. But they're so confusing and it's hard to figure out.You know, part what have it reveals is the transactional nature of national presidential politics. Part of it reveals that this is someone who requires a lot of thought into what exactly should be done and said by her campaign. But she's not -- but she's not being accused of things that he is being accused of.KELLY: But Trump's temperament and the way he treats people has become an issue in this campaign. Some of these e-mails we have seen from her, from her team talking about how she treats those around her, Secret Service and others, how diminishing she allegedly is, how she doesn't care about the so-called little people she surrounds herself with. You tell me, if the media wanted to make that a story, they easily could.O'KEEFE: Those e-mails as I understand it are from former diplomatic security folks talking to FBI agents. They're not in John Podesta's inbox.KELLY: So what? My point is that it confirms a narrative that has been out there about her, too. But if it doesn't inure to her benefit it doesn't necessarily make the front page, not of the ""Washington Post,"" just --O'KEEFE: We have had the e-mail stories on our front page and out home page a lot.BAIER: It's something he is going to hit on again and again probably, Monica. This is an ad that he has out today ahead of this debate, Donald Trump ad. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Tonight's debate is the biggest night of the campaign. I'm going to take the stage to fight for you, the American people. I'm going to hold crooked Hillary accountable and stand up for the forgotten Americans she's left behind for 30 years. She hasn't done the job. She never will.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: So ""crooked Hillary"" is back in this ad. We will see about the dynamics before the debate starts, whether there's a handshake, what happens.CROWLEY: Yes, well, it's going to be high drama, because, again, this is his last chance to really reset this campaign. But I think he is going to do a couple of things tonight. As I said, he has to make this about the American people and the future of the country. Then he has got to point to the wreckage of the Obama-Clinton economy and foreign policy and simply say, we tried it your way.He also has to lay out a positive pro-growth economic agenda and a strong national security agenda. And I think he would do well to put her back on her heals and get her on the defensive on the WikiLeaks disclosures because, we just had this conversation, the mainstream media is not doing that job. He should talk about the sordidness and cynicism and corruption that has been exposed by these WikiLeaks. And all he needs is two or three examples about the media collusion or the fact that there was collusion to obstruct justice on the Benghazi e-mails or the fact she knew that Saudi Arabia and Qatar were funding ISIS and yet her foundation, the Clinton Foundation continued to take tens of millions of dollars from those regimes. All he needs is a couple of bullet points to get her on the defensive, and then I think he will find an effective opening.KELLY: How much room does very to move the numbers, Steve, if he has a stellar performance tonight?HAYES: I don't think very much. People are going to -- let's say he has the best -- the consensus coming out of this is this is not only his best performance but the best performance we've seen in debates this year. Are people going to make the judgment based on what they have seen in this one performance? He has followed Monica's advice, he's talked about the economy. Or are they going to judge what they have seen him do over the course of the campaign? I think the impressions are pretty deep at this point. It's really hard to change them.BAIER: All right, more with the panel as we come back to Las Vegas and this final presidential debate. The countdown is on. Chris Wallace is getting ready someplace.KELLY: It's exciting.BAIER: Don't you think?Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" April 25, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If you collude in business or if you collude in the stock market, they put you in jail. But in politics, because it's a rigged system, because it's a corrupt enterprise, in politics you are allowed to collude. So they colluded, and actually I was happy, because it shows how weak they are.GOV. JOHN KASICH, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't see this as a big deal other than the fact I'm not going to spend resources in Indiana and he's not going to spend in other places. So what? What's the big deal? I've never told them not to vote for me. They ought to vote for me. But I'm not over there campaigning and spending resources.SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think that is a decision, allocation of resources, that makes a lot of sense, and it's devoted to the principle of beating Hillary Clinton in November and turning this country around.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: John Kasich doesn't talk about it the same way Ted Cruz talks about it, but it is a deal apparently between the two campaigns that Kasich is not going to campaign or spend money in Indiana so Cruz can have a one-on- one shot, and Cruz is not going to campaign or spend money in New Mexico or Oregon so Kasich could have a one-on-one shot.Here is why they are doing it. Take a look at three states tomorrow. The Real Clear Politics average of polls, Pennsylvania, Donald Trump up big in Pennsylvania. Connecticut, the average there, even bigger over John Kasich in second. And Maryland, Donald Trump up big over Kasich and Cruz. Those are three states of the five tomorrow.Let's bring in our panel: Steve Hayes, senior writer for The Weekly Standard; Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National Public Radio, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. OK, Mara, does this work?MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: I don't think it's really going to work. I think Donald Trump is on track to get the delegates he needs, not necessarily 1,237, but to get the delegates he needs to get the nomination on the first ballot.BAIER: What number is that?LIASSON: I think it's in the 1,100-ish. And I think if he shows up in Cleveland with around 1,100 or above and he's hundreds of delegates above Ted Cruz, I think you are going to see delegates come his way. I think he will have to get 1,237 on the first ballot, but I think there's a way to do that for him.We have seen in poll after poll big majorities of Republican voters say they think the nominee should be the candidate with the most delegates, not necessarily 1,237. And what's going to happen tomorrow is, I think, he'll sweep the Acela corridor primary, and every time he does that, even New York where everybody knew he was going to win, it's just another psychological notch that tells the never-Trump people that they don't have much of a chance of stopping him.BAIER: If you do the math, Steve, it seems like he could come up short. He's had I guess 58 percent, almost 60 percent of the remaining delegates to get to 1,237. But still, momentum mean a lot.STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Momentum can mean a lot. It didn't mean much to Cruz after Wisconsin. But I think if you look at the victory in New York and you couple that with the polling that we've seen in recent days, it certainly looks like Trump is picking up steam, certainly not losing steam. I think if you take the public polling we have seen in Indiana and beyond the polls, the states that are coming up tomorrow, and Indiana, California most recently, he looks like he could be on track to get to 1,237. I think if he's at 1,100 there's a big fight.LIASSON: You think it has to be higher?HAYES: I think it has to be considerably higher. Look, I think there are Republicans who would like to fight if he's at 1,236, and I think they have every right to fight if he's at 1,236. But for practical purposes, you're seeing a lot of Republicans who have been anti-Trump or sounded like they were in the never-Trump camp who are backing off of that a little bit. You are seeing sort of this normalization of Trump with his hiring of Paul Manafort, some of these other folks. And the more that he wins, the more that that happens, and the more it weakens the never Trump -- I don't think it weakens their argument substantively, but the more that it makes their cause difficult.BAIER: I heard a lot of people talking about this today, Charles. And some said, wow, it's kind of late.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: It's extremely late. Had they worked this out a month or two ago where they each go one-on-one, Trump has said I want to go one-on-one with Cruz. Well, he'll get his chance in Indiana. But we're really at a point where this is the endgame. Earl Weaver once said momentum is tomorrow's starting pitcher, meaning there is no momentum. It depends where you are tomorrow.The thing is there's no tomorrow, really. This is a last attempt to try to stop momentum. It means something. I think the result of the New York vote, 61 percent, I mean, a huge blowout. And if you get the five state sweep on Tuesday, you have got a candidate on a toll coming into Cleveland. If he's on a roll, I think Mara is right. He could be 50 away, maybe even 100 away, and there will be a sense that the people want him, you have to go with the people. And that's what the momentum will mean.This can work to the extent if he stopped in Indiana, if Cruz is strong enough to do that, that could have a psychological effect. I think everybody says it's all about numbers and numbers. No. It's about what the sense is, what the people want in a broad sense. And if you stop them in one place or if you do in California, then I think you can have a fight on the floor that looks like it is a legitimate fight.BAIER: But Indiana is the next big moment in this race, fair to say?LIASSON: Fair to say. And I think that Cruz and Kasich, if they want to stop Trump were smart to try to do this. The question for Indiana is can Cruz replicate what happened in Wisconsin? In Wisconsin you had a pretty unusual situation. You had a governor. You had a well-respected speaker who while he didn't endorse it was pretty clear where he was at. You had all these talk show hosts lined up against Trump. You had a lot of forces against him. I don't know if that's going to be the same thing in Indiana.KRAUTHAMMER: And Trump made the tactical mistake of running against the governor, not understanding quite how popular he is.BAIER: The latest poll in Indiana, and there's not a lot of polling in Indiana, is the FOX poll on Friday which had Trump up seven. You take Kasich out and it's a two-point lead for Trump.HAYES: I think it was likely to be even if this deal never happened, I think it was likely to be tighter than that. Indiana, there are a lot of reasons to believe Indiana could be a friendly state to Ted Cruz.But look, it is the case that the people will have to a certain extent spoken if Trump heads into the delegation, into the convention with the most delegates. It's also the case that 60 plus percent of Republicans haven't voted for Trump, and of the group, a significant number, I would argue a plurality of the people who haven't voted for Trump, have said they are never going to vote for Trump, they are not going to vote for him, period. That is a huge problem for the Republican Party going forward.BAIER: But I guess their argument is that no single candidate gets more than Trump.HAYES: It's a totally fair argument. It's a perfectly logical argument. We have to be pretty careful. There are a lot of people, particularly Trump supporters, who threw around the phrase ""the people"" as if everybody has spoken and this is an overwhelming win. There are huge numbers of people who don't support Trump and will not support Trump in Cleveland.LIASSON: Even if the choice is Hillary Clinton?HAYES: Absolutely. LIASSON: You think they are going to stick to their guns?HAYES: This is not a normal election. Let's put it that way.BAIER: On this issue let's take a listen to one of the Koch brothers this weekend on this issue.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You couldn't see yourself supporting Hillary Clinton, could you?CHARLES KOCH, KOCH INDUSTRIES: Well, her -- we would have to believe her actions would be quite different than her rhetoric. Let me put it that way. Some of the Republican candidates, before we could support them we would have to believe their actions would be quite different from the rhetoric we have heard so far.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Well, that kicked up a storm. Hillary Clinton said she didn't want money from the Koch brothers at all.KRAUTHAMMER: I'm sure if the Koch's offered money anonymously and untraceably, she would probably say yes. But she can't do it in public.With the Koch brothers, it's not as shocking as people think. They are rather libertarian in their thinking. Trump would be anathema to them. He is a big government guy. Cruz, who is small government guy, nonetheless is very, very anti-libertarian in a sense on social issues. So for them it's a dilemma.If you hear them, however, saying that they could actually not support the top two, I think that reinforces what Steve is saying. There are a lot of Republicans who will stay home or write in or do something else. And that is a threat, which is why I think this idea of the people's choice is a matter of perception. I'm not saying I defend that argument. I think you have to win a majority. But nonetheless it will be seen as illegitimate if it's taken away when he's that close.BAIER: But to Mara's point, the unifying figure in the Republican race is Hillary Clinton.HAYES: There is no unifying figure in the Republican race. Hillary Clinton will be unifying to a certain extent. She can't overcome what Donald Trump is and has done for many Republican voters.LIASSON: If you listen to the focus groups, the Wal-Mart moms, or the ones Peter Hart has done with Republican leaning women, they all say they -- oh, they dismiss the things Donald Trump says. I think you are going to find a lot of people coming around to Trump.HAYES: The exit polls pretty consistently show that people who say they would strongly consider a third party candidate if it were a Hillary Clinton/Donald Trump head-to-head matchup, a number between 35, in one state is 43 percent. You can't just shrug that off. There are people who object to Trump both on ideological grounds, as Charles says he's big government, and on principled grounds. They think he's not a man of integrity or character. Those people are not going to change their minds.BAIER: We will see tomorrow how things stacks up.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

9	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/02/03/what-next-for-ben-carson-campaign/	What's next for the Ben Carson campaign?	"This is a RUSH transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" February 2, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: ""Personal Story Segment"" tonight, last night in Iowa, Ben Carson gathered 9 percent of the vote. But the Doctor believes the Cruz campaign hurt him at the caucus by putting out false rumors he was quitting the race.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. BEN CARSON (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If Ted Cruz doesn't know about this, then he clearly needs to very quickly get rid of some people in his organization and if he does know about it, isn't this the exact kind of thing that the American people are tired of? Why would we want to continue with that kind of, you know, shenanigan?(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Joining us now from Palm Beach, Florida -- Palm Gardens, Florida I should say, Ben Carson. I want you to explain what happened. Because everybody doesn't really know what happened. A CNN post of some kind went up at 7:20 Central time, 8:20 Eastern -- ok. And what did that say?CARSON: Basically said that I was in the process of suspending my activities.O'REILLY: Ok.CARSON: And that I was going back --O'REILLY: That you were quitting.Carson: -- that I was going to go back home, that I wasn't going to go to New Hampshire. I wasn't going to go to South Carolina.O'REILLY: All right. So CNN put that up. Let's just walk through this so we know what we are talking about. CNN put that up -- apparently that came from Steve King, the congressman in Iowa. Is that where that came from?CARSON: Well, Steve King subsequently tweeted out that it looks like Carson is out of the race and, therefore, you need to reconsider.O'REILLY: Now, do you know who put the original CNN thing up? Who did that? Was that CNN itself?CARSON: I have no idea where they derived such information or why they would not be interested in verifying it.O'REILLY: Well, isn't it CNN's fault then rather than Ted Cruz? Because if CNN did that, and believe me, CNN has put out false information about me, this program, Fox News. We're not surprised. It seems like that's what they do over there. But, isn't it CNN's fault and not Ted Cruz's fault?CARSON: Well, I talked to Ted Cruz earlier today. And he says that he didn't know anything about what the campaign did in terms of contacting precincts telling people that I was dropping out -- that a vote for me was a wasted vote. You know, my wife spoke at one of the caucus locations and a Cruz person before her had told everybody that I wasn't going to be in the race and that they should reconsider their vote.A Carson person had spoken already. But the people wanted to hear from my wife. She did go up. She spoke. They loved her. Standing ovation and we won that precinct.O'REILLY: Ok.CARSON: I don't know what the total impact would be across all of the precincts, but obviously this is the kind of thing that we don't want happening.O'REILLY: Absolutely. But I'm trying to find out who the villains are here. Look, you got 9 percent. If you were out of the race, that 9 percent, most of it would have gone to Cruz, all right? Because you guys, you know, are very religious-oriented, your message is tailored for the evangelical. It makes perfect sense.But I'm trying to figure out who the real villain is here. When you talk - - you talked to Ted Cruz today, ok. Are you satisfied with his explanation?CARSON: Well, I have to accept at his word that he didn't know because he said if he had known, he would have not agreed with such a thing.O'REILLY: Ok. So you're accepting his word and a gentleman will do that his campaign still ran with false information -- information that helped them, no doubt. But the information, it looks like, came from CNN. That's what it looks like.CARSON: Yes. But, Bill, here's the issue. A culture exists within the Cruz camp that would allow people to take advantage of a situation like this in a very dishonest way. Isn't this the same thing we see with the administration, the IRS scandal? No responsibility.Let's see what, in fact, the Cruz campaign will do about those individuals who inappropriately disseminated this information knowing that the caucuses were not over. They were awfully anxious to get it out there, weren't they?O'REILLY: Sure. But that's politics as usual to me. All right.So, did you call CNN? Do you have anybody in your people call CNN and say what the deuce is going on? Why would you put out false information? Have you investigated that?CARSON: Our people are investigating that absolutely.O'REILLY: All right. So when you know, we need to know. All right? Because I agree with you. I want to put this -- I want to stop this. I want to stop it cold.CARSON: Right.Well, there are so many people who have said that's just the way it is. It's a cesspool. That's the way politics is.O'REILLY: No. Don't stand for it.CARSON: I don't accept it.O'REILLY: Don't stand for it.CARSON: I don't accept it at all.O'REILLY: Absolutely. You are going to campaign in New Hampshire. You're going compete in New Hampshire. You're a viable candidate. And those people attacking you and spreading false information. We need to find out what's going on over there because that news agency has to be held accountable. I will give you the last word, Doc.CARSON: Absolutely. Well, I just appreciate the fact, Bill, that you and some others do want to get to the bottom of it and if we expose these kinds of things, and we condemn them and the people are the ones who have to say this is unacceptable, we will not do this. This is not the right thing to do. It's not the Christian thing to do. Don't accept it.O'REILLY: All right. I'm with you on this. Let us know what you find out. We will do our own investigation and we'll call over there and tomorrow we will update the story.Doctor -- thank you as always.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.
