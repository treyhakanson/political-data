This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST, ""THE KELLY FILE"":  Breaking tonight, one of the most dramatic media moments in Donald Trump's run for the White House and that's saying something.  This morning ended with a 40-second sound bite and touched off a day full of political fallout that has not stopped yet.  Welcome to THE KELLY FILE everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly.  After roughly five years of raising questions about exactly where President Barack Obama may have been born, Donald Trump yesterday declared he would finally put the issue to rest.  First he announced a news conference, then his campaign followed up with a written statement, Trump hit the early news shows promising a major announcement.  And by 10:00 a.m. this morning, all of the nation's major media outlets were breathlessly gathered awaiting the candidate's comments.  At 11:03 a.m., an hour after this event was supposed to begin, out walked Trump, surrounded by a group of veterans who then proceeded to take the microphone in turns praising Mr. Trump's commitment to the military. Finally, some 90 minutes after the start of nonstop live coverage by all of the cable nets, we finally got to hear more about what is known now as the birther issue.  Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy.  I finished it.  I finished it. You know what I mean.  President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period.  Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  As short as that was, there's a lot to unpack from it.  Including reactions from Republicans, Democrats and the White House, along with Trump's history on this issue and that of Mrs. Clinton.  And we have a powerful lineup for you this evening, including Governor Mike Huckabee, former Reagan cabinet member Bill Bennett, former Bush media strategist Mark McKinnon and managing editor of Bloomberg Politics Mark Halperin.  But first we go to Trace Gallagher in our West Coast newsroom to walk us through how we got to this moment.  Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Megyn, from our research, it appears Donald Trump first dipped his toe in the birther issue in 2011 when he was considering running for president in 2012.  In February, 2011, Trump told the Conservative Political Action Conference or CPAC, quote, ""Our current president came out of nowhere.  The people who went to school with him, they never saw him.  They don't know who he is.  It's crazy.""  A month later he told Bill O'Reilly that President Obama, quote, ""doesn't have a birth certificate"" and later told NBC News that he was sending a team of investigators to Hawaii to investigate. In April of 2011, President Obama who had already released a short form birth certificate in 2008 decided to release the long form saying it was time to put the issue to rest.  And even though the Trump campaign is now taking credit for President Obama releasing his long form in 2011, Donald Trump continued for years to claim that Obama was not a U.S. citizen.  As late as the summer of 2015, Trump said he didn't know if Obama was born in the U.S.  The Trump campaign also blames Hillary Clinton for raising the birther issue in the first place during her 2008 campaign, referring to this interview on ""60 Minutes"" when asked if she thought Barack Obama was Muslim.  Watch.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You said you take Senator Obama at his word that he's not a Muslim.   HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  No.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don't believe that he's a Muslim?CLINTON:  No.  There is nothing to base that on as far as I know.   (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER:  Even though fact check organizations say Clinton didn't start the birther issue, they acknowledge that her ""60 Minutes"" interview certainly fanned the flames.  And her supporters in 2008 did propagate it. Today Hillary Clinton said this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  For five years, he has led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black president.  His campaign was founded on this outrageous lie.   (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER:  And some political analysts believe it's too late for Trump to talk his way out of birtherism, a Washington Post op-ed reads in part, quote, ""While avoiding accountability for the act of feeding the conspiracy in the first place and while continuing to wink at the deplorables in his base by signaling that their birtherism is not just perfectly acceptable but admirable.""  So despite saying President Obama was born in the U.S., period, the story continues -- Megyn.  KELLY:  Trace, thank you.  In the meantime, Mrs. Clinton today says, there is no erasing the birther issue for Donald Trump even if he says it's behind him.  Within a couple of hours of her remarks, the Congressional Black Caucus came out to support her argument.  Watch this.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is a disgusting day.  Donald Trump is a disgusting fraud.   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We've had enough and we're not going to take it anymore.  We will not elect a cheap bigot.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One of the things that we all are used to in this business is dog whistles.  But the thing that we're not used to, and I'm finding it very difficult to get and used to, are the howls of wolves.   (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Joining me now to respond, Donald Trump supporter and Fox News contributor Governor Mike Huckabee.  Governor, great to see you.   GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thanks, Megyn.  Great to be here.   KELLY:  So, it was fascinating to watch this unfold on various media outlets today because our folks, our friends on the other networks said, no way, did he put this to bed today and said every statement he said today was a lie.  Your thoughts.  HUCKABEE:  Well, first of all, I think the media got totally just bamboozled and they hate it.  I mean, what you're seeing is --  KELLY:  They got punked.   HUCKABEE:  They totally got punked and they can't stand it.  So, they're going to use all of the resources they have to do what they were going to do anyway.  Look, if Donald Trump would come out on and said, I love the media, they're great, I'm going to apologize to everybody starting with the New York phone book, do you think they're going to treat him differently?KELLY:  Uh-hm.HUCKABEE:  No.  So, why not go ahead and tweak him a little.KELLY:  They're irritated because he played it up.  They said, it was going to be a presser, it wasn't a presser.  It was three lines, and he left and then he didn't take the media with him.  And people wanted him to answer questions which he hasn't done in two months.  Meanwhile she hasn't done it and it was like two years.  But they were irritated with him.  But then they also were questioning the accuracy of what he said.   HUCKABEE:  But they're always irritated at him.  Let's also keep in mind that it was just this week that the media had the lowest approval numbers in the history of polling.   KELLY:  Okay.  But what about the claims that he made, that she started it but he finished it.  Now, we happen to have some information about Hillary Clinton that you're not going to hear on some of the other networks and we're going to get to that in a moment.  It's not necessarily clear that she has nothing to do with it as her defenders are claiming but she didn't, quote, ""start it.""  And Donald Trump was very much the person holding the flag on this one, was he not?HUCKABEE:  I don't know that he started it.  I mean, there were a lot of things out there.  And I remember Bill Clinton saying --  KELLY:  I'm not saying Trump started it but he held the flag on it.  And she accused him of founding his campaign on it.  He did make a huge issue out of this in 2011 and 2012.   HUCKABEE:  But let's keep in mind.  At that time, Donald Trump was not a politician, he was not a political candidate.  Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton, they both were.   KELLY:  Okay.  But I have you here as a Trump surrogate.  HUCKABEE:  Yes.KELLY:  So, I'm going to get to Richard Fowler next after you.  HUCKABEE:  Okay.KELLY:  But Trump did make a huge issue out of this.  And even after he claims he put it to bed when he got Barack Obama to release the long form birth certificate proving as, he has been in the case, he was born in Hawaii, he kept it up.  And we have all of the tweets from 2012 where he keeps going on and on and on.  Talking about, this is from September 13th, 2012, wake up America, see this article.  Obama birth certificate is a fake.  And then again, August 2012, an extremely credible sources called my office and told me that, Barack Obama's birth certificate is a fraud.  And on and on.  It went all the way to January of this year.   HUCKABEE:  Look, I'm not going to deny that Donald Trump made a lot of questions about his birth certificate.  But, you know, here's a question. Maybe you can raise it to Richard, you know, because Richard is going to be foaming at the mouth.  I like Richard.  He's a friend.  But let me ask you something.  When you watch the Black Caucus as I did, not just a snippet but the whole thing, they repeatedly said Donald Trump is a bigot, he's a racist, he's been a racist all of his life.  Now, what evidence is there for that?  There isn't any.  There is none.   KELLY:  Well, they believe, what they say is the attempted delegitimize, the first black president is in itself bigoted and racist.   HUCKABEE:  If they can show that what he was saying was because he was black, then they've got a point.  But they can't do that because --   KELLY:  Well, it's the connection to Africa.  The suggestion is that he was born in Kenya, and not born in America.  And that's where they bring the race in?HUCKABEE:  But once again, to say that he's a racist, that he is a bigot, that's nonsense.  There's an old rule all is fair in love and war and politics.  And so in a sense, this is not all that unusual.  When I find interesting, is that when I hear the people who are against Donald Trump, whether it's Hillary or the caucus or whoever it is, or the media, but then again I repeat myself, it sounds like they're all sucking from the same helium balloon because they all have that same shrill voice and say the exact same words, as if they're reading a script.   KELLY:  All right.  Got to go.  Great to see you.   HUCKABEE:  Good to see you.KELLY:  While the Clinton camp has spent much of the less 24 hours attacking Trump on this issue, that strategy does have some risk.  You would not know it to watch some of the other channels today but we're going to get to this in a minute.  This morning Mrs. Clinton tweeted out, quote, ""President Obama's successor cannot and will not be the one who led the racist birther movement, period.""  And that got this response from the former Washington bureau chief of the McClatchy news service who wrote and I quote, ""So why did your man Sid Blumenthal spread the Obama birther rumor to me in 2008 asking us to investigate?  Remember?""Joining me now, nationally syndicated radio talk show host and senior fellow at the New Leaders Council, Richard Fowler.  How about that, Richard?  This is the former head of the McClatchy news service saying, her top guy, Sid Blumenthal came to him and said, he wasn't born here. Go investigate it.   RICHARD FOWLER, NEW LEADERS COUNCIL:  Megyn, to use your words, breaking tonight.  We've learned something new that we've already known for seven years.  President Barack Obama is an American.  It's astonishing.  It's eye popping.  It's shocking.   KELLY:  Right.  We know that.  We know that.  FOWLER:  Shocking.KELLY:  Right.  So, Donald Trump has come to terms with that, which we'll talk about in a second.  But I'm starting with you on whether Hillary is as squeaky clean on this as she would have us believe.   FOWLER:  So, let's talk about that.  So, PolitiFact released a report about, in 2015 about this birther controversy --  KELLY:  They didn't cover Sid Blumenthal.  They did not cover what this McClatchy guy has said.FOWLER:  You know what?  Wait a minute.  So, what we found in the PolitiFact report was that there was some folks -- the name of the group is called Puma.  Right?  So, they did not want the president, they were Democrats.  They were not going to get in line and they posted this picture of the President in Muslim garb.  And that is how this birther thing could have started but there is no connection to the Hillary Clinton campaign, no connection to the Hillary Clinton --  KELLY:  Sid Blumenthal is connected to Hillary Clinton.  That's her top aid.  That is her guy.  That is her right-hand man.   FOWLER:  Megyn, but this former reporter who I don't know, this has not been fact checked.  Nobody knows who this guy is.  Clearly they're former, so that says something about him, right?KELLY:  No, it doesn't.   FOWLER:  I take this with a grain of salt.  At the end of the day, we know the President is born in America.  We've known for the past seven years that Donald Trump has pushed this crazy conspiracy theory --  KELLY:  That is true.FOWLER: -- to only benefit himself and his gold plated new hotel down the street from the studio.   KELLY:  Well, let me ask you this.  Because you heard Governor Mike Huckabee saying, you cannot come out and say based on the --  (CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)Okay.  But he says, you cannot come out and just denounce the man as a bigot based on the birtherism we've seen.   FOWLER:  Well, I think, here's the thing.  If Donald Trump is trying to get the African-American vote, right?  Which right now he has five percent, recent poll has six, Mitt Romney has, he is going to have to --  KELLY:  He's at 25 percent in South Carolina for the record.   FOWLER:  Yes.  But South Carolina, Democrats are not going to win South Carolina regardless.  So, he can have that.  Right?  The truth of the matter here is this, for Donald Trump to get the African-American vote, what he should have done today was go out and apologize to the American people for perpetuating this fraud and he did not.  He made this one line. He pimped the media beyond belief, right?  KELLY:  Uh-hm.FOWLER:  And he's not going to get black voters.  He's saying to black people I really don't care about you even though I want you to quote- unquote, ""give me a chance.""  I'm going to continue to push this rhetoric, not talking about any solutions for your community.  And so, African- Americans need to go out and not necessarily vote for Hillary Clinton but you should at least vote against Donald Trump.  And Hillary Clinton's campaign has got to be focused on turning out black voters.   KELLY:  Uh-hm.  And they're paying attention.  FOWLER:  Got to be.   KELLY:  That is becoming --  FOWLER:  Got to be.KELLY:  More and more of an issue.  Richard, great to see you.  Thank you.FOWLER:  It's always good to see you.  Happy Friday, Megyn.KELLY:  You got to go now and have drinks with the Governor.  So, Donald Trump cuts into Clinton's lead in yet another key state and Chris Stirewalt is next on what we're see in these numbers before Bill Bennett joins us on what to expect next.  Plus, a rare glimpse at the media circus that unfolded when word got out that Mrs. Clinton had fallen ill.  Mark McKinnon of The Circus along with his partner in crime Mark Halperin, he is making a special appearance tonight on ""The Kelly File."" I have the behind the scenes scoop just ahead.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is what they have to do.  They have to sit here all day just in case, you know, a doctor comes out with some news.  The press used to be able to get up pretty close to the house.  Now they've got barricades up so that traffic can't even drive down the street.  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Well just 53 days to go until the 2016 election and new polls out this week suggest the race is growing tighter by the day.  Tonight, there is another state to add to the list of key territories where Donald Trump is gaining ground.  In Michigan, Trump trails Clinton by just three points. Thirty five percent to Clinton's 38 percent.  That is quite a shift from just last month when Trump faced an 11-point deficit.  That's on top of another poll out of Ohio.  This one from Suffolk University that has Trump up by three in that state.  The third Ohio poll in two days with Trump in the lead.  Joining me now, Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News digital politics editor. Chris, good to see you.  CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR:  Thank you.KELLY:  And now, here goes Michigan, a state that is expected to vote Democrat, that typically votes Democrat and it's down to three now.  I mean, something huge happened in the past seven days, that's the bottom- line.  Just one week ago she was in a great position, seven days later she's got to be crying in her soup.  STIREWALT:  Well, we have not an unprecedented -- I would say it would be an unprecedented collapse for Hillary Clinton's poll numbers except for the fact that she's done it before.  If you look at her trajectory line over the arc of this election which got started, really in general election, he got started in early May.  She goes along and then she goes, boom and then she hits these speed bumps and falls apart.   KELLY:  What did she do?  Was it basket full of deplorables?  Was it the collapse at the ceremony?   STIREWALT:  So, the deplorables parts relates more to the strengthening. We see a slight strengthening in Trump's numbers, he's up in Michigan and Ohio.  A couple of few points here and there.  But what you see that makes the way so much closer is that she's falling apart.  And I would say that this has to do with the health problems and the lying about the health problems and then before that, you had this nation of news about e-mails but also about funny business with the Clinton Foundation.  So she's had a drum beat of negative stories and things that really reinforce the things that people like least about her and her husband and their family.   KELLY:  Uh-hm.  And so now, Trump has rebounded in Ohio and how.  He's right there in Florida as well.  North Carolina has tightened significantly.  I mean, if he gets those three, does he need Pennsylvania? Does he need Virginia?  Colorado is tightening too.   STIREWALT:  Well, if he can't have Virginia and Colorado, then he will need Pennsylvania or something else big.  And that is where we would look at Nevada, Iowa, Minnesota.  There are states --    KELLY:  He's winning in Ohio by a lot now -- I mean, Iowa, by a lot right now.   STIREWALT:  Exactly.  Iowa looks very good for him.  This is the kind of states.  Massive white population and a lot of older white voters without college degrees.  This is the Trump demographic that works well for him. And there are a lot of those voters in Michigan.  And that's why the map could look different this year.  But I would also point you to this, councilor.  When we look at these numbers, probably the most striking thing is how few people, relatively speaking, are voting for -- are expressing a preference for these candidates.  Four years ago at this point when our Fox News poll was in the field, we founded about 10 percent of people either had no opinion or were voting for a minor party candidate.  It's doubled that this time around.  And now we're talking about, one in five voters does not express support for either of the two major party candidates.  That means there's still a lot of snap left in the line here and it's going to be exciting.   KELLY:  What makes you think before I let you go, that they're going to vote at all?STIREWALT:  Well, that's -- this is -- you asked the perfect question.  We have no idea whether people who say they can't be bothered to choose between the chicken entree or the fish entree, whether or not they're really going to end up ordering at all or they're going to leave the banquet hall hungry.   KELLY:  I think they're just going to hit the martinis.  Chris, great to see you.  STIREWALT:  You bet.KELLY:  That's what makes them happy.  Joining me now with more.  Bill Bennett, chairman of Conservative Leaders for Education and former secretary of education under President Reagan. Bill, great to see you.  So, you tell me, I think --  BILL BENNETT, AUTHOR, ""TRIED BY FIRE"":  Good to see you, Megyn.  Martinis my lead-in.   KELLY:  Don't you think?  I don't know.  It's like you don't like the chicken, you don't like the fish.  You're good with like the slightly dirty, the olives or the blue cheese.  Was it basket full of deplorables, was it the collapse at 9/11.  In seven days, we've had a complete reversal in the race.   BENNETT:  Yes.  I think the onion skin started to come off, the peeling started to come off, we started to see the real Hillary.  And it was, yes, it was the deplorables.  By the way, I am PH.D. plorable leading a group of PH.D.s for Trump, about six of us.  Anyway, that didn't help.  And then of course the e-mail stuff.  Everything Chris mentioned.  But another factor, Colin Powell, a long-time friend of the Clintons ripped into her, talked about her unbridled ambition, her greed, I won't mention the bimbos running around the house, but the fact that she is not a transformational figure. She then sounded very shrill and I used the word advisedly, very shrill and very angry talking about Trump and xenophobic, homophobic, racist and so on.  And this is the angry Mrs. Clinton that people find so unattractive. So that -- then the collapse.  Then the collapse.   KELLY:  Angry but also she was accused of sounding quite elitist in those comments.   BENNETT:  Yes, no question.   KELLY:  And I realize she tried to quantify it saying, not all Trump supporters but at least half of them.  But if you're a Trump supporter you assume she's putting you in that half and it's offensive.   BENNETT:  Yes.  That's right.  That's right.  And she was making mention of her Wellesley degree today and Yale Law School, not a good idea particularly when you're putting down other people.  People who maybe worked --  KELLY:  Well, Trump is constantly mentioning his Wharton degree.  And it's like, he can get away with certain things and has been from the beginning. But let me ask you this.  So if you're advising Trump and asked you this to vote candidate, if you're advising Trump right now, you got 53 days left, just do what, do you say?BENNETT:  Just do what you have been doing, hitting the themes, going to the communities, talk about education.  I think you'll hear more about that.  Talk about the economy, talk about what her plan is, what is her plan, why do we want eight more years of Obama.  And here's the irony. People are saying, well, I wonder if she will get to him and that he will come apart.  She seems to be the one who is coming apart.   KELLY:  You don't think Trump needs to go big, just slow and steady at this point.  We'll get him where he needs to go.  But if you're advising her, what do you tell her to do?BENNETT:  Become another person.  You know, it's not --  KELLY:  That's not helpful.   BENNETT:  That is not easy.  But, I mean, sooner or later that TV camera, those interviews are x-rays and they see into the soul and American people are seeing something they don't like very much -- Megyn.   KELLY:  Bill, you are officially not going to get hired by the Clinton camp.   BENNETT:  Let's have a martini.   KELLY:  Great to see you.  (LAUGHTER)BENNETT:  Not their next secretary of education.   KELLY:  No, no, definitely not.   Well, after weeks of uncomfortable questions about the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton has tonight chosen to lead a big dollar bash collecting up to $250,000 a head in what we're told is a big fundraiser for the Clinton Foundation.  The last one, though, they say, the last one before the election.  I'm sure it will have no effect on the Clintons.   Plus, Howie Kurtz and Rich Lowry are here on how Mrs. Clinton might handle the first big debate now that she's used up some of her best attacks already.  They're next.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PATRICIA STARK, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Live from America's News Headquarters, I'm Patricia Stark.  The FBI and U.S. Capitol police charging a man from Tennessee with threatening to kill U.S. lawmakers from Hawaii.  The man allegedly sent e-mails and videos threatening to open up fire on a federal building in Honolulu.  Authorities say, he was targeting U.S. Senator Mazie Hirono and U.S. Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, both of whom are Democrats.  And a Florida man who finally got in George Zimmerman's truck during a road rage incident has been convicted of attempted second degree murder. Matthew Apperson argued he fired his gun in self-defense but prosecutors claimed Zimmerman's truck had tinted windows which were rolled up during the incident.  You may remember Zimmerman was acquitted three years ago in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager.  I'm Patricia Stark and now back to ""The Kelly File."" For all of your headlines, log on to FoxNews.com.  KELLY:  We are ten days out now from the very first presidential debate. It's exciting.  And with Trump closing the gap now in the polls, some political writers are starting to ask whether Mrs. Clinton has already used up all of her best attacks when it comes to Donald Trump.  Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: He is taking hate groups mainstream.He wants to divide us from the rest of the world and from each other.Trump is reinforcing harmful stereotypes and offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters.A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.A man with a long history of racial discrimination, who traffics in dark, conspiracy theories...He is temperamentally unfit to be president and commander-in-chief.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KELLY: Joining me now, two of the folks asking this question, Howie Kurtz, the host of ""MediaBuzz"" on FNC and Rich Lowry, editor of the National Review and a Fox News contributor. Good to see you both.RICH LOWRY, NATIONAL REVIEW EDITOR: Hi, Megyn.KELLY: So, that is a question. I mean it's a question going after Trump in general. There's so much and he just constantly is doing something controversial and so on, but is there anything left for her to say, Howie?HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEW MEDIA BUZZ SHOW HOST: Well, she's pretty much fired all of her nuclear war heads once you have called your opponent unfit for the presidency, dangerous, a bigot, a shady businessman, a fear monger, a conspiracy theorist. I think all she's got left in the arsenal is some pop guns and maybe some sling shots.But look, this was always the danger of Hillary Clinton, a risk of building so much of her campaign around demonizing Donald Trump, I mean, he's done the same thing to crooked Hillary, but she doesn't have a signature issue or a shorthand for what she would for the country.  KELLY: And yet those audiences get -- that's going to get record numbers, Rich. I mean the presidential debate is going to have an audience that hasn't heard all of these attack, that hasn't really -- people live their lives, you know, they don't pay as close attention to it as we might think.LOWRY: Well the audience is going to be enormous and this arguably is going to be the most momentous presidential debate since Carter-Reagan in 1980. And I'm with Howie, you know, there is sense to what Hillary has tried to do in this campaign, which is just disqualify Donald Trump as this dangerous madman.The problem is, for her, that creates a really low bar for Donald Trump to get over and one of the reason that the polls have closed the last month is Donald Trump -- when he shows up and just uses a reasonable tone of voice and gives a serious speech and goes to a venue that's kind of different and interesting. It's not a rally. It shows he's not a dangerous madman and it falsifies that entire line of attack. Now, if he can carry that off in the debate, there is some chance this race flips and the advantage goes to Donald Trump.KELLY: What about -- there was an article out today, Howie, talking about in ""Politico"" from Glenn Thrush talking about these are five factors that could still lead to Trump's downfall saying look, everything has gone his way recently, he's still not ahead, saying the cable and the TV networks are going to come after him like nobody's business.KURTZ: Well, this race isn't over in Trump's favor any more than it was over in Hillary's favor a month ago when she had that 10 and 12 point lead and a lot of people were just speculating about who she would have in her cabinet. So, you know, Hillary Clinton still has the built-in Electoral College advantage that will help. But in terms of, I mean, Rich makes some really good point, which is Donald Trump now has a lower bar to clear so, in terms of debates.A lot of people who might be expecting him to be formulating (ph) and attacking crooked Hillary might see a more sober figure if she chooses to go that way. I really think that Hillary Clinton has to fashion some kind of appeal to those white working class voters who are tempted by the Trump brand, who might ordinarily vote Democratic. She has to offer them something about improving their lives. But when she talks about policy, she's kind of boring and it's hard for her to break because she doesn't have the showmanship.LOWRY: This is could bean irony about where this race is now. For months and months and months, we've heard about how Trump needs to pivot, can he pivot, will he pivot. Well he finally sort of pivoted. Now, Hillary Clinton needs to pivot. She needs to do things that are original, interesting and unexpected. I think it would have been great for her when she was feeling better after that New York collapse to stand up in front of the press, do an hour and a half press conference on my health. That's all I want. I'm going to answer every single question.I'm going to release every record. That would have been completely unexpected. It would have created a sense of openness we've never seen from her or instead of having us, you know, big Clinton Foundation bash for Bill's birthday, why not come out and say immediately, you know, I get the doubts about the Foundation, no one with the name of Clinton is going to have anything to do with this Foundation beginning right now.KELLY: Why would she fuel any of the fires? It's almost like she's walking around with two iPhones again. You know, like...LOWRY: Right.KELLY: Don't you understand?LOWRY: And she is sort of -- she's banking on she can just continue to grind this out in a conventional way. And maybe she can, but it's a big risk now. And we don't know if she's hit bottom yet.KURTZ: She's such a cautious candidate and it's hard for her to just, you know, be herself because she feels like she will be hammered.KELLY: This was one of the things they worried about over in team Clinton, about going up against Donald Trump. The unpredictability of his message and how and whether she'd be able to respond, you know, definitely (ph), good to see you both.LOWRY: Thanks Megyn.KURTZ: Good to see you Megyn.KELLY: Up next, as Rich just mentioned, after weeks of questions about quote ""pay for play"" involving the Clinton Foundation and Hillary, that Foundation is holding what it says will be its very last big bash before the election. Is this a good idea? We'll take a look at the possible fallout.Plus, the ""Circus"" producers with, Mark McKinnon and Mark Halprin is here as well tonight, our next on what the cameras found at Chappaqua this week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just one week ago, Hillary Clinton was getting points for letting the press in, get closer and now we're going just back the other direction again.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Developing tonight, in the week since a cell phone camera caught Hillary Clinton collapsing at a 9/11 ceremony, her campaign has been taking hits over transparency, honesty and how it tries to manage the media. Immediately after that incident, cameras from the Showtime series ""The Circus"" travelled to the Clinton compound in Chappaqua, New York. What they found there tonight gives you some behind the scenes insights on the media and the Clintons. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, this is the press pool. We're responsible for reporting any news that occurs here. This is what they have to do. They got to sit here all day just in case, you know, a doctor comes out with some news. The press used to be able to get up pretty close to the house. Now, they've got barricades up so that traffic can't even drive up the street.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're on the street. We're not on her property.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't want to go into semantics with you folks. I'm trying to be civil about it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you guys talk to your bosses? I mean, we got to do our job too, you know.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I understand.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's not the problem.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You want to send in the black top there in the ditch next to the trees.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm fine with that.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah, if we have to, sure.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm fine with that.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's what you got to do to keep your boss happy.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're not giving us the freedom of speech. You're not doing your job. This is ridiculous. That's America here. Not Russia. It's America.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Watch yourself. There is a truck coming.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just one week ago Hillary Clinton was getting points for letting the press in, get closer. And now we're going just back the other direction again.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at us. We're putting ourselves in danger just for freedom of speech.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The press united will never be defeated. The press united will never be defeated.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now are ""Circus"" co-creators and executive producers, Mark McKinnon and Mark Halprin is here tonight as well, great to see you both.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good to be here.KELLY: So basically, she's arms length from the media and has been. Now, she did take a couple of questions yesterday so I shouldn't had said anything two years, but she didn't love to talk.MARK MCKINNON, THE CIRCUS CO-PRODUCER: Well, it had been a year before two weeks ago on the plane. It had been 270 days. And the thing -- I was there and I was struck by the fact that when she did do it, she was fine. She got a lot of questions and a lot of them were tough, they weren't soft. She was the pro and that makes you wonder why she waited that long. But as I said in the piece, she was getting some credit and now this whole week is just like, oh well...KELLY: This has been a terrible week. I mean, you could argue the worst of her campaign. Mark, you thoughts on what happened to her, I mean, I was seeing last night, looks like she suffered a campaign catastrophe when you see what happened with the polling and these various states where her lead has been cut in half or lost completely, in a week.MARK HALPERIN, THE CIRCUS CO-PRODUCER: Yeah, I mean it's funny to think back, three weeks, four weeks ago the whole story line was is the Republican Party going to abandon Trump and want to run with him. Now if you look at the polling this week, national polls, he's tied or ahead. And in key states like Florida and Ohio he's ahead. The Clinton campaign does not dispute that. And in some states like Colorado and Virginia, that people are basically saying give those to Clinton, they're competitive again.And so, what we look at Sunday night on ""The Circus"" is the flow of this week and the context of the polls tightening, Clinton under pressure because of what happened to her health but also because of basket of deplorable, but Trump under pressure too.KELLY: What do you think is happening inside the Clinton camp? Are they in a panic?MCKINNON: There's a lot of bed wetting going on in the Democratic Party right now.KELLY: There has to be, right. I mean, they're frittering away a huge lead.MCKINNON: They've clawed their way to the bottom.HALPERIN: You take the candidate off for work for three days, right, that's a huge vacuum. But you saw President Obama step in and had one of the best events of the year for any politician.MCKINNON: Great surrogate.KELLY: Michelle Obama got big (ph).(CROSSTALK)HALPERIN: So there are other people out there, but the reality I think we learned this week is she's got to win this for herself. She's not going to coast to a win. She has to fight for it and she's never fought successfully, you know...MCKINNON: ...in every presidential campaign where the candidate has to fight to win it, you know, this is a critical moment she's got to show that she's got the determination and fight and desire to win this.KELLY: What did you make of what we found...HALPERIN: She did fight to win Bernie Sanders. It's the one time she's fought to win.KELLY: What did you make of what me saw from Trump today?MCKINNON: I was completely astonished by this whole birther thing. I mean, just when I thought I sort of had things figured out, I'm like...KELLY: Why would they be doing this?MCKINNON: Yes. I mean, you know, we saw a kinder gentler version, the polls are tightening and now all of a sudden birther.KELLY: Calling attention to one of the least favorite aspects of him.MCKINNON: Yes.HALPERIN: But if he hadn't changed his position, I think people are going to continue to ask him about it. And his aides had already put out that he had changed his position, but he hadn't said it himself so I think they thought they might be able to get away with that. Just having surrogates there...KELLY: Why the drama? Why not just give an interview and mention it?HALPERIN: Because I think he wanted to control the way it happened and you can't control things as well with an interview.KELLY: Do you think that this puts a period at the end of the birther thing or no?HALPERIN: I think it does for some people and for the media. You know, think about the beginning of the week. I thought we were going to be covering, all of us including on ""The Circus"" baskets of deplorables and Hillary Clinton's health. Those things have been washed away by their medical records not by what's happened with Donald Trump and the birther thing. So, I think by Monday we won't be talking about it. It still have a lot of resonance for a lot of people but I don't think it's going to be...MCKINNON: That's one thing that's been amazing about this campaign is we have this epic sort of news events happen and two days later, something completely different.KELLY: When we talk about for, you know, in many instances what Donald Trump wants us to talk about. I mean, that's how he drives the news cycle...HALPERIN: And this is a classic example.KELLY: ...and the media runs along like lemons.HALPERIN: The Clintons have been worried about this for the entire time they realized they were going to face Donald Trump, which is he can control the news better than a former first lady of the United States can and that's a challenge because if Trump is controlling what gets talked about, more days than not it's what Trump wants to talk about.KELLY: We'll be talking about ""The Circus"" and watching ""The Circus"" and love it. Thank you guys so much. Well the Clinton Foundation is tonight having its last big bash before the election with donors paying up to a quarter of a million bucks a head to be a friend of the Foundation. David Wohl and Krystal Ball are here next on whether this party tonight could lead to new problems for the Clintons. Don't go away.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL CLINTON, FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: I spent half my lifetime doing this work. I got tickled the other day when Mr. Trump called my foundation a criminal enterprise.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, new details on President Clinton's 70th birthday bash -- a party that will also double as the final Clinton Foundation fundraiser before the election. The event is under way right now in New York's swanky Rainbow Room with donors being asked to pony up as much as $250,000 a head to be part of the fun. Trace Gallagher live in our West Coast newsroom with the latest on that.TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, even Hillary Clinton supporters say the lavish fundraiser smacks of excess and it comes at a time when her campaign is dealing with questions about the e-mail scandal, her health and falling poll numbers. And let's also point out the event calls more attention to the Clinton's relationship with foundation donors and allegations concerning conflicts of interest and whether donors got special access to the State Department while she was secretary of state.The campaign reminds us that if Hillary Clinton wins the White House, the Clinton Foundation will spin-off into an independent organization. And we're told this fundraiser/Bill Clinton birthday bash will help many different causes. To be listed as a chair of the event you had to put down $250,000 -- $100,000 to be co-chair, $50,000 to be vice chair but you get to hear Jon Bon Jovi and Barbara Streisand. Clinton donors will convene again Monday for the Clinton Global Initiative three-day gathering, which also ends in an extravagant gala dinner.One Hillary Clinton supporter said the Initiative does good work but the optics are not optimum. Trump on the other hand is once again promising to sever all of his business ties should he win saying this on ""Fox & Friends"" yesterday. Watch.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)TRUMP: Well, I will sever connections and I'll have my children and my executives run the company and I won't discuss it with them. It's just so unimportant compared to what we're doing about making America great again. I just wouldn't care.(END AUDIO CLIP)  GALLAGHER: The Trump line of questioning comes after ""NewsWeek"" claimed that his foreign business dealings could hamper national security, Megyn.KELLY: Trace, thanks. Joining me now with more, David Wohl, an attorney and Trump supporter, Krystal Ball as well is here. She's a Clinton supporter and senior fellow at the New Leaders Council, good to see you both.DAVID WOHL, TRUMP SUPPORTER: Hi Megyn.KRYSTAL BALL, NEW LEADERS COUNCIL SENIOR FELLOW: Me too.KELLY: So, David, you know the Clinton team is going to say the Clinton Foundation is all good, helps a lot of, you know, sick kids and why shouldn't he raise money to help them?WOHL: Yeah, right after it's exposed as corrupt, pay to play organization, Megyn, with direct ties to Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state, Bill decides to throw this big birthday bash -- birthday bash with the cover charge being $250,000 or for the impoverished party goers, $100,000. The money going straight to the Clinton Foundation.Now, Megyn, people already know, these aren't just benevolent souls. They know that if Hillary Clinton gets elected, they may just have that red carpet roll out the front door of the White House and they may get to talk to her about whatever problems they may be having. Even the Democrats want it shut down, Megyn. But what is she doing? What are Bill doing? They're ramping it up. Just unvelievable.KELLY: Well, let me ask you about this Krystal. So, conceding that the Clinton Foundation does a lot of good through its, you know, charitable donations, the optics of this are terrible -- terrible. Does she need this right now in her campaign?BALL: I don't understand how raising money, celebrating 70 years on this planet and raising money for an undisputable good cause. I don't see how that's a scandal.KELLY: So let me just -- I'll explain that...BALL: Megyn, $500,000 a plate.BALL: So I'll explain that -- I'll explain that without David's somewhat partisan spin. It's that people believe that these donors to the foundation may want something more than just to do good, that they may want to please the future president of the United States with a big donation that could get them access to someone who would be very, very powerful. And that's why some even left leaning publications have said she needs to shut this thing down now.BALL: But, Megyn, we've seen lots of Hillary Clinton's e-mails. We have not seen any evidence of any scandal other than maybe a donor getting a better seat at a dinner. Meanwhile on the other side, Trump Foundation actually had a real pay to play scandal and no one is calling for him to cut off his business interest right now.So, it's a complete double standard. You know, I think Bill Clinton wants to do some good on this planet. He's clearly demonstrated that during his 70 years and I don't see any reason why he shouldn't celebrate his birthday in this fashion.KELLY: Well, what about that David, because it's actually, just to correct myself, it's actually been mostly the left leaning press organizations have mostly said she needs to shut it down if she wins. Only one or two have said right now.WOHL: Well, I mean, what's been going on Megyn, it should have been shut down when she was secretary of state. That's the whole point. The reality is that they're continuing with this. They're so brash in the way they just flaunt this Clinton Foundation and to bring people...BALL: So David, should Trump...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Hold on, talk over each other.WOHL: Megyn, will UBS be a partygoer tonight because we know what Mrs. Clinton did for UBS when they had IRS problem. She directly intervened. This is not just an imaginary scandal. It's real. And somebody to give $250,000 to go to a birthday party, they want a lot more than Bill Clinton's autograph.KELLY: All right.BALL: This is a closely vetted list of long time personal friends that are already foundation donors. These are not new people. And David I just want to mention...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Great to see you both and happy birthday, Bill. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: So what do you think? Should the Clintons be holding this fundraiser for the foundation right now? Go to facebooook.com/thekellyfile. Follow me on Twitter and let me know, and would you pay $250,000 to see Barbara Streisand or Bon Jovi?ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Jackson: Alton Sterling was no threat to the police	"This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" July 6, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight just over 24 hours after the director of the FBI recommended no criminal charges for Hillary Clinton and the U.S. Attorney General declares that the investigation into Mrs. Clinton's e-mails is officially over. But Congress says not so fast, demanding that both James Comey and Loretta Lynch step forward and answer questions.Good evening, and welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly.  Tomorrow we will see the first of two high profile hearings as a Republican-led Congress demands to know how an FBI investigation can find Secretary Clinton did so much wrong in the handling of top secret information but does not qualify for prosecution. But even before the questions begin, team Clinton is dismissing this as a partisan attack.  Echoing some of the same arguments we have seen for nearly a year and a half now.  It was 16 months ago when Hillary Clinton held her most extensive press conference to date on the controversy surrounding her use of a private offsite e-mail server while she was at the State Department. As we showed you last night, many of the claims Mrs. Clinton made during that presser were contradicted in stunning fashion by the FBI. At the start of that news conference, Mrs. Clinton painted herself at the time as a cooperative partner with investigators.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: My direction to conduct the thorough investigation was to err on the side of providing anything that could be possibly viewed as work related. That is the responsibility of the individual, and I have fulfilled that responsibility, and I have no doubts that we've done exactly what we should have done.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: You know, Phil Houston, he says it's not only not making eye contact, but when you say I have fulfilled that obligation, that is what they call a tell, right? I have fulfilled the obligation. Right? Mrs. Clinton's surrogates and even her husband derided those who doubted her claims like the one you just saw right there as part of a right wing conspiracy against her. Similar tactics the Clintons used throughout the '80s and '90s.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is all this part of a vast right wing conspiracy then, is it just the same old, same old?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, it's just mostly stupid media people talking, other stupid media people making stuff up and spinning themselves up on something that's not going to amount to a hill of bean.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Republicans are trying to take this fact finding expedition into a partisan exercise meant to hurt Hillary Clinton's campaign.BILL CLINTON, 42ND PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This e-mail thing became the biggest story in the world. I have never seen so much expended on so little.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Stupid media people are to blame. Right? Then Mrs. Clinton and her campaign shifted towards downplaying the matter altogether, noting past State Department's use of similar practices according to her, even adding what we now know to be a misleading statement about retroactive classification.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: It was not prohibited, it was not in any way disallowed, and as I've said and as now has come out, my predecessors did the same thing, and many other people in the government.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We find ourselves in the same situation as Colin Powell and Condi Rice's top aides and having e-mails retroactively classified.  And as Colin Powell said to some extent, this is an absurdity.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: An absurdity. An absurdity, except the FBI director said everything she said in that sound bite was not true. Two months later when a State Department inspector general's report sharply criticized Mrs. Clinton's e-mail practices, team Clinton again said it was not her fault, but the fault of practices already in place there.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think a big reason why the report finds that it was unacceptable and fell short for her to be using this habit of copying her aides on her correspondence was because it turned out that the record keeping in place at the State Department was so poor.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Remember, Director Comey said that should never have been the case and said that, quote, ""none of these e-mails should have been on any kind of unclassified system and that she should have known that."" Well, the next day Hillary Clinton offered an apology of sorts but again claimed this was common practice as she saw it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: This report makes clear that personal e-mail use was the practice for other secretaries of state, and I know that because it is well known, it's pointed out in the report. But it was still a mistake, and as I've said many times, if I could go back, I would do it differently.KELLY: It was still a mistake. Right? It took a lot to get her to say it was a mistake. For weeks she didn't say that, then she finally said it was a mistake. After it was announced that Director Comey would not recommend charges against Mrs. Clinton, despite a devastating rebuttal of her many claims from that March 10th presser, her supporters said time to move on.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The most important thing that happened today was Hillary Clinton moved past a legal cloud and that gives her and the voters the chance to say could we talk about the instances that matter to the voters.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Like honesty? That is something that matters, maybe, I don't know.  Then yesterday when it was announced that the House GOP wanted to hold a hearing to examine Mr. Comey's findings, the campaign came full circle, again reverting back to charges of a partisan witch-hunt with National Spokesman Brian Fallon tweeting, Benghazi Committee probe ended with partisan thud, so, of course, House GOP wants to launch new goose chase.""  This time about Comey and emails.Joining me now to discuss it all. Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News digital politics editor and Howie Kurtz, host of ""MediaBuzz."" I should have gotten Phil Houston. No offense, we needed this spy guy, he ran the CIA's interrogation program for 25 years. And you know, it's just, you know, it's just a tell you have to look for clusters, it's a long story, you should buy his book, ""buy the lie."" Stirewalt --(LAUGHTER)CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: I'm not offended at all by what he did.KELLY: I'll just start with this, it's actually not -- the two points that we made in the intro are not inconsistent. She could have been misleading.STIREWALT: Right.KELLY: And she could have been caught by Director Comey misleading.STIREWALT: Right.KELLY: And Brian Fallon might be right, as well, it's a partisan witch- hunt.STIREWALT: Yes.KELLY: What's your view?STIREWALT: Look, the Republicans want hearings because they want to keep talking about this, and so is it partisan? Sure. The -- that's why we have a partisan system, we have a competition. Why did Democrats go after George W. Bush in a way that they didn't go after Bill Clinton? Because he was a Republican. That's a rigged system --KELLY: To call Director Comey before, it's like it's suggesting they don't trust Director Comey. I mean, for weeks they'd been saying that they trust him, he's a straight shooter, they are going to trust his recommendation, and now it's not to their liking. It's like bring him to poor Congress.STIREWALT: Well, it's something to do and we know how this movie usually ends. It usually ends with the Republicans to do what they do, Clinton and the press. And again you mentioned to the 1980s, this is the playbook, this is always how it goes.KELLY: Walk us through it.STIREWALT: You start out, you deny. Was not me, I was not there, I didn't sell the pardon, I didn't have sex with her, I didn't -- whatever it is, this did not happen. And then incontrovertible evidence is put up your snout and you go, well, something happened, sorry. Little bit. And then you do the modified limited hang out, you back it down, you knock it down a little bit, but all the while you attack your accuser and destroy your accuser so that by the time you get to the end people say can't we just move on.KELLY: It's old news.STIREWALT: Move on.KELLY: That is something the American people care about Howie Kurtz.HOWIE KURTZ, HOST, ""MEDIA BUZZ"": Exactly.KELLY: I mean, look, they may or may not care about Hillary Clinton lying, they may or may not care about her e-mails, but dishonesty is something we poll about after every primary. At least the pollsters still believe it matters. You know, maybe it does, maybe it doesn't, but move on. People don't care is her position now.KURTZ: Well, speaking on behalf of stupid media people, when I covered the Clinton White House scandals, there was this playbook, as Chris said, and it was more than just deny and delay. It was also stiffing the press by saying there was an ongoing investigation so we can't talk about it. Only the media cares, the public doesn't care. You can give an answer to when you have to. And then when the probe is over, declare the story to be old news and then try to discredit your adversaries as partisan and then continue to avoid the press.KELLY: Right.KURTZ: Hillary Clinton, as you know, has not held a news conference this year, and yet -- and I see no sign that she's about to do so as these questions build up about her voracity. She should welcome an opportunity to talk about this, because otherwise it will just be the Republicans talking about it.KELLY: They came out there and said, oh anything that -- first she said there was no classified information, which was not true. And then she comes out and says, well, anything that was classified was classified only retroactively so I didn't know at the time. And when people said, that's not true, the reports we're getting is that, you knew it was classified.  John Podesta, you know, her senior campaign guy come out there and says, that's an absurdity. Anybody who questions her, you know, that she did something different than Colin Powell, that's an absurdity. Well, not according to the director of the FBI, and now we're told, would you just move on you partisan witch-hunt people? Stirewalt.(LAUGHTER)STIREWALT: You know, you partisan witch-hunt people, rotten. The problem for Republicans, and I think you put it together right there, which is, you say if you discredit Comey and this investigation, you discredit Comey and his findings that she engaged in heinous, beyond heinous electronic hygiene and she took these risks and she did all that stuff. So you can't say this is all wrong, Comey's all wet, which if you want to keep the part of Comey that's helpful for Republicans, you can only go so far in discrediting him and the thing they are going to be asking him about is, are you pressured, were you pressured? I think it's highly unlikely that he's going to sit in front of Congress and say, now that you guys mention it, this is all a fraud.KELLY: Yes. Good luck. Good luck trying to make Director Comey sweat.  We'll report back to you tomorrow night. Guys, good to see you both.STIREWALT: You bet.KURTZ: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: Joining us now, Mo Elleithee, he's the former traveling press secretary for Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. Mo, good to see you. So --MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: Hey.KELLY: Let's put the Comey thing to the side for a minute, right, because I heard all of the people say straight shooter, you can trust him, we're going to go with what he said. Now they don't like the unconclusionist (ph), you will appear, people are saying he's got to step down.ELLEITHEE: Why? What's wrong with that guy?KELLY: Okay?ELLEITHEE: Right. Yes.KELLY: But, you know, he did start off by saying, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, and to look back at how her campaign and her surrogates like Hillary Rosen spun it, you know, even today, move on, you know, people don't care, it's offensive. Does it offend you on any level?ELLEITHEE: You know, this is one of those situations where, look, you know, full disclosure, you've said it, I used to work for her and I'm a fan of hers, but look, this is one of those cases where I actually wish both sides were just a little better right now. I think the Republicans are just there -- the way they are going after it, I get it, we're in the middle of an election season, they don't like her, they made that very clear, this also gives them something than Donald Trump to talk about, which they desperately want and need right now, but as we talked about, they are stepping on their own message.KELLY: Because it gives her the chance to play the victim. I mean, it gives her the chance to come out, you know, through herself or through surrogates to say, wow, really? You know, the FBI, which reportedly had dozens of agents looking into this has reached its conclusion. Now we need to go through another, what, you know, 16-hour hearing with her. It's like why don't they just, you know, sort of take what Comey gave them and make the most of it?ELLEITHEE: I think you make this as campaign issue if they want and leave it to the voters to decide at the ballot box. Now, here's where I wish the Clinton campaign would maybe do it just a little bit differently. She has admitted that she made a mistake. She has admitted very recently that she has work to do when it comes to the trust question that people don't trust her, and she acknowledges that. Now, this is actually -- could be an opportunity for her.She could step out there right now and say, look, the FBI said there was nothing illegal that happened, but that we made a lot of mistakes. You know what, they are right. I've said it, I will say it again, we have made a lot of mistakes, and I can't regret that enough.KELLY: Right.ELLEITHEE: Here's what as president I would do moving forward to make sure no one makes those mistakes ever again.KELLY: Right. A full throated apology and something that shows she really believes she made a mistake and proves it to the American people.ELLEITHEE: And learns and grew from that experience, which Donald Trump can't do.KELLY: Right. It was an opportunity, we'll look forward to hearing from her sometime in the next seven months, that's how long it's been. So, maybe we'll have to travel to wherever she is and shout some questions so we can actually get answers to some of these legitimate questions. Mo, always a pleasure, sir.ELLEITHEE: Thanks.KELLY: That's going to happen. So, with these hearings 12 hours away, one of the top national security lawyers in this country, I think he is the top, is with us tonight on whether the FBI probe could pose serious issues for some of Mrs. Clinton's top aides. This is an interesting angle not being covered.Plus, Dana Perino is next on what she had to go through in the Bush White House to make sure the nation's secrets were kept safe. She made news tonight for an epic twitter rant. And we'll talk about it. Oh, yes, they like that, they like that.  (APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)And then we have new video in a confrontation now getting national attention after police shoot a black man in a struggle. Reverend Jesse Jackson is here, along with Detective Mark Fuhrman. Stay tuned for that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I demand for the chief to be fired immediately! I demand that he resign if he has the guts.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: In just hours, the director of the FBI will testify in front of a House Oversight Committee for a, quote, ""Emergency hearing on the bureau's investigation into Hillary Clinton."" Next week lawmakers will be grilling Attorney General Loretta Lynch who announced this evening that she, too, has decided that she will not bring any charges in this case. But before either of these hearings were confirmed, House Speaker Paul Ryan was telling ""The Kelly File"" that now is the time for Hillary to bear the consequences of what even the FBI called reckless actions.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: I think the DNI, the Director of National Intelligence should block her access to classified information given how recklessly she handled this during the presidential campaign. If she becomes president, that's one thing, but I don't think she should get classified information.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: National Security lawyer Mark Zaid and Dana Perino is also here, they'll both be with us in a moment.But first we go to our chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge with more. Catherine?CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, after the House Speaker told you Hillary Clinton's access to classified information should be blocked, today the White House responded.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOSH EARNEST, PRESS WHITE HOUSE SECRETARY: When we're talking about the safety and security of classified information, we should leave those decisions in the hands of our intelligence professionals and not risk them being sullied by the --  (END VIDEO CLIP)HERRIDGE: The FBI director was silent Tuesday on the Clinton aides, but said most government employees guilty of similar behavior would be punished, typically includes losing their security clearance and the possibility of future government employment.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR: Those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions, but that's not what we're deciding now.(END VIDEO CLIP)HERRIDGE: The House and Senate Judiciary Committees want the FBI director to also explain how the investigators findings back up his decision not to recommend criminal charges and there are new questions tonight whether Clinton misled Congress last year about the deletion of her e-mails. And this exchange with Republican Congressman Jim Jordan.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO: I'm asking how it was done. Did someone physically look at the 62,000 e-mails, or did you use search terms, date parameters? I want to know the specifics.CLINTON: The search terms were everything you could imagine that might be related to anything, but they also went through every single e-mail.COMEY: Lawyers doing the sorting for Secretary Clinton in 2014 did not individually read the content of all of her e-mails as we did for those available to us.(END VIDEO CLIP)HERRIDGE: That's one of the issues we expect to hear a lot more about tomorrow -- Megyn.KELLY: Catherine Herridge, thank you.Joining me now with reaction, Mark Zaid, a national security lawyer out of D.C. Mark, thank you for being here. So, you represent people who get caught in these situations and actually you say you have real concerns about what's going to happen to Hillary Clinton's aides, like her top aide Huma Abedin or Jake Sullivan, if she wins and goes to the White House.  Explain.MARK ZAID, NATIONAL SECURITY LAWYER: Well, yes, I handle these cases all the time for the last 20 years trying to help people dealing with clearance issues. And, I mean, Director Comey really said it for us, he indicated that they were grossly careless and while it didn't rise to the level of prosecution, it very clearly, I think from his words, and that was an unprecedented press conference, created some very serious concerns in his mind. Now, they go through, including Secretary Clinton, go through the same vetting that individuals such as I do for security clearances, and one of the issues to look at is whether or not they have security violations, and very clearly they do.KELLY: How could they deny Huma Abedin or Jake Sullivan this, you know, this access when Hillary Clinton was the secretary of state and if she becomes the president, of course she's going to have it. So, how do you know, you sort of kill the underling when the principal is getting the access?ZAID: Yes. Look, this is a very unique situation. I don't know of any other situation that one can even compare. I mean, there was a situation, I think, with Secretary of State Baker in the early '80s when polygraph issues, it was sort of a clearance issue, one of his secretaries failed the polygraph and he abolished the polygraph at the State Department still doesn't exist except in certain circumstances. I mean, the president of the United States generally never gets involved in these types of decisions. I don't think if Hillary Clinton won that she would either, I would hope. But you know, then again, you know, there are professionals that will adjudicate these individual's clearances at each of the agencies, and they could be denied access to staff programs or S.C.I. programs or even --  KELLY: That's the super-secret stuff.ZAID: Yes. Or even a clearance.KELLY: Before we go, I need a quick answer on this. Do you think it's the right decision to call Comey before Congress?ZAID: No, I don't. First of all, as you mentioned in you prior segment, he's a very seasoned prosecutor. This was such an unprecedented press conference, I don't think he's going to go into any detail beyond it. He can't set a precedent for the FBI, and where is it going to go? I mean, what do they think anyone is going to say? I think the big loser that is going to come out of tomorrow, were going to be both parties. Because, you know, the Republicans are going to attack him and the Democrats are going to attack him and everybody is going to look bad. And, you know, we'll see how he ends up. Maybe he'll look the best out of everybody.KELLY: Uh-hm. Mark Zaid, great to see you.ZAID: My pleasure. Any time.KELLY: Well, as both sides dig in on the significance of this FBI report, former White House Press Secretary Dana Perino took to social media today to write about her experience protecting the nation's secrets when she worked in the west wing. Getting attention when she suggested that Hillary Clinton not only put the White House at risk, but also endangered the legacy of her own boss and the security of this country.Dana Perino is with me now, co-host of ""THE FIVE,"" former press secretary for President Bush. Good to see you.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST, ""THE FIVE"": Thank you.KELLY: So, you were uncharacteristically ticked off today.PERINO: Well, and I had Wi-Fi on the plane.(LAUGHTER)KELLY: So, what it is that's most irking you?PERINO: Well, it's just that I think that having a security clearance is such a privilege. You are entrusted with the nation's secrets. This isn't about you. When you work for the federal government, and especially at the White House at her level, you work on behalf of the people. And so it wasn't that she was just trying to protect herself politically for convenience, she was putting the nation at risk. She was putting her boss President Obama at risk, and it was just an extremely dishonorable thing to do.KELLY: What does that show -- what does that show you about her?PERINO: I think that the Republicans' best argument is that the Clintons, especially Hillary Clinton, have always believed that they are above the law, that the law doesn't apply to me. I would have been stripped of my security clearance like that, but I never would have done that because I cared too much about the job that I had --  KELLY: It's that big of deal in other words, when you get that security clearance, you start handling confidential classified documents, it's a huge deal.PERINO: It's on your mind all the time. And people would ask me when you're at the podium and you get a question from the press, and you have classified information in your head, how do you avoid talking about it?  And I said, oh, I have a steel box in my head.KELLY: Uh-hm.PERINO: There's classified information in there that no one is ever going to get to, even to this day.KELLY: Uh-hm. What do you make of what's happening tomorrow and what the Republican -- I mean, are they overplaying their hand?PERINO: Yes in a way, but I understand also why they have to do it. I think the whole reason we know about this e-mail situation is because of the Benghazi Committee that Congressman Trey Gowdy put forward. That is the whole reason we found out about the private server. So, there is a reason for Congress to have a chance to ask questions. I hope they don't do any grandstanding.KELLY: But that's the problem, that's what they always do.PERINO: They always do it.KELLY: They don't get real information.PERINO: They always do it. And you know, when they read their questions that staff prepared. If they are just sincere and honest and try to get information, I think that's fine. But I also think this. We have always know what's going to happen, they are going to move on --KELLY: Uh-hm.PERINO: And what Hillary Rosen said, move on, this is old news, that's going to happen. So everyone --KELLY: Talk about something people care about which doesn't include honesty.PERINO: That's right, but they are wrong, people do care about this, but I don't know if enough people care about this to deny her the presidency.KELLY: Uh-hm. Well, I feel like the Republicans have what they are going to get, you know, that opening statement by Director Comey. Why don't they just take --PERINO: Quote his words. Don't say anything else. Play the ad a lot, see whether it resonates. And I think Comey knew that.KELLY: Yes.PERINO: I think he was trying to offer some sort of punishment.KELLY: I don't know. I know a lot of lawyers. I haven't heard any lawyer say anything other than you can trust him, he's a man of integrity. He doesn't make his decisions based on a partisan basis. Now suddenly you don't get the decision that you like. People do this to judges all the time, he's the worst! He sucks! (audio gap) That was controversial because the tax laws to save ObamaCare, in any event, point taken.Dana Perino, always great to see you. That was weird, no one even argued it. It was like a throwaway line. What?Anyway, tonight, Donald Trump and Newt Gingrich are storming the Buckeye State just as reports hit up that a V.P. pick appears to be just around the corner. Ben Domenech and Guy Benson are here with who Trump is likely to choose.Plus, we're keeping a close eye on an exclusive situation in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where controversy is growing tonight over the police shooting of a black man earlier this week. Reverend Jesse Jackson and Detective Mark Fuhrman join us live just ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump making headlines today as he drops multiple hints as to how and when he will choose his running mate. Tonight in Cincinnati, Ohio Trump appeared at a rally with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, just hours after saying he's considering a short list of ten people. In moments, we'll be joined by Ben Domenech and Guy Benson about who they believe Trump's going to choose. But first, we got to Fox News Mike Tobin live in Cincinnati. Mike?  MIKE TOBIN, DFOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey Megyn, right on the top of the list of things that Trump was talking about, doubling down on his Saddam Hussein comments interpreted by some as praise for Saddam Hussein because Trump said Saddam was good at killing terrorists.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Donald Trump loves Saddam Hussein. I said, that's not what I said. That's not what I said. So that's the narrative that goes around.(END VIDEO CLIP)TOBIN: And as you mentioned, speculation is running wild about the V.P. pick. We know that Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee is out, Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa seems to be out, and Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey has a chance, as does Governor Mike Pence of Indiana. Senator -- Congressman Jeff Sessions is on the list. The very top of the list for the moment anyway seems to be former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.The crowd here in Ohio chanted Newt, Newt, Newt as Trump said one way or another Gingrich will be part of his administration. Possibly, he could be the guide (ph) who helps Trump navigate Capitol Hill. Here in Ohio, Gingrich saying Trump's praises.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: The difference between all of the folks who came out and talked and Donald Trump is that he has had a lifetime of creating jobs, a lifetime of building buildings, a lifetime of getting things done. Everybody else talks about how they would like to sort of change Washington a little bit in a calm such way. This guy is going to kick over the table.(CHEERING)(EDN VIDEO CLIP)TOBIN: Now, Trump heads tomorrow to Washington, D.C. to meet with Senate and House Republicans, particularly those who aren't too crazy about him. He will try to get their hackles up about Hillary Clinton and present himself as a better option. Megyn?KELLY: Mike Tobin, great to see you. Joining me now is Ben Domenech, publisher of ""The Federalist"" and Guy Benson who's a Fox News contributor and a political editor at Townhall.com. Great to see you both. So Ben, I'll start with you, if you had to -- give me your top two likely from team Trump, who would they be?BEN DOMENECH, THE FEDERALIST PUBLISHER: I think at this stage you have to consider the top two to include Newt Gingrich, to include Chris Christie and I think that that's an interesting dynamic because these are two people who have been very significant surrogates for him on the campaign trail. What you want in a vice presidential selection is someone who's media savvy, who's tested, who's a known quantity and can be a good surrogate for the candidate. You heard Gingrich doing that just the other day.The difference between the two of them I would say is that Chris Christie actually has a background that is pretty checkered when it comes to issues like judges. Where someone like Gingrich would reassure I think a lot of conservatives that when it comes to a Supreme Court nomination they could trust a Trump-Gingrich ticket to deliver on those items. He's certainly is making a play for it and wants -- clearly wants it and I think that this is the move that would be smart for Trump to make.KELLY: So it would help him secure the difficult white male vote that he's struggling with.(LAUGHTER)KELLY: That's what you were saying.DOMENECH: I didn't hear -- I didn't hear anybody on that list that was not a white male that was just given by (inaudible).KELLY: Listen, I bet, I mean that assumes that logic by these pundits assumes that if he picks Joni Ernst, who took herself out of it today, the Iowa senator, that women are going to say, I'm voting for Trump. Women who look like -- do women or, you know, African-Americans or Hispanics really vote based on gender or color or heritage of the running mate? I'll ask you that Ben and then I'll go to Guy.DOMENECH: You know, it doesn't really work that way. From my perspective, what you see in this list that Trump, at least the names that have been publicly available, there's always that possibility that there's some dark horse out there that we're not talking about. I think a lot more that has to do with enforcing his right flank, with making sure he doesn't lose any conservative votes who would have voted for Mitt Romney last time around when it comes to the fall.KELLY: Guy, do you agree Christie and Newt are likely the top two?GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, look, I don't pretend to lay any claim to expertise on Donald Trump's psyche or thought processes at any time. That being said, I do think based on what we've seen from Trump himself and from comments from Cory Lewandowski, the fired campaign manager, is that Trump is prioritizing two things in this search.The first is someone who's experienced in Washington, knows policy, knows D.C., knows how the inner workings all play out. He's also looking for someone with whom he is personally very comfortable. If those are the top two items or bullet points on the agenda, I think that probably points to Newt Gingrich.KELLY: What do you think of that ticket, Guy? What do you think of that ticket, you know, Trump-Gingrich?BENSON: Well, I think there would be some flaws. Newt Gingrich has some significant negatives that he brings to the table, including his unfavorability rating among voters. That being said, Newt has a lot of currency with many conservatives, he is fluent on policy issues, and is very effective as a surrogate and certainly would not have any compunction, in fact he would relish being an attack dog against the Democratic ticket.KELLY: I can't imagine the debate with Newt Gingrich. We will tune in -- that might get more ratings than -- no, it won't, never mind. But it will get a lot of ratings because he's a good debater. It's great to see you both.BENSON: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: I mean, who doesn't want to see the Trump/Hillary debate, right? Who, like, whatever you're doing, you'd cancel. It's like, whatever, you got to see it happen.Up next, we are monitoring the scene out of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, after an officer-involved shooting of a black man sparks national outrage and a federal investigation already. Former LAPD homicide detective Mark Furman is here, civil rights attorney Anndell Brown are here, and then Reverend Jesse Jackson is here.(COMMERCIAL BRAK)KELLY: Developing tonight, tensions high in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, tonight after less than 24 hours ago Baton Rouge police responded to an incident outside of a local convenience store involving a reportedly armed man. Within minutes, the tense confrontation turns fatal as bystanders captured the incident on cell phone video. We want to warn you that the content is very graphic.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get on the ground. Get on the (bleep) ground.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's got a gun. Don't (bleep) move. I swear to God.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh (bleep).UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, my God!UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They shot him?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my (bleep) goodness.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, my God!(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Fox's Casey Stegall is live in Dallas with the late breaking details, Casey?CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS DALLAS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, investigators say this all started when a 911 call was made about a disturbance at that Baton Rouge convenience store. The caller stated that there was a man outside selling CD's and that he threatened somebody with a weapon.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Gun in his pocket. He pulled a gun on the complainant and told him he couldn't be around there.(END AUDIO CLIP)STEGALL: That's when two white officers responded to the call and confronted the African-American suspect, 37-year-old Alton Sterling. Now, a second video of what happened next has emerged, and again we want to warn you it is extremely graphic. It shows the two police officers rolling on the ground with sterling and then you hear those gunshots.The Baton Rouge police chief confirmed today that Sterling was indeed armed at the time, but it's not clear where his weapon was leading up to and during the confrontation. After the struggle, Sterling's lifeless body remained on the ground and one of the officers called this into dispatch.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Shots fired. Shots fired.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Copy. Shots fired. North Foster. 2100 North Foster.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Both officers okay, suspect is down. I need EMS, Code 3.(END AUDIO CLIP)STEGALL: Now, community outrage over the shooting sparked protest on the streets of Baton Rouge for two nights in a row now. In fact, it's still ongoing at this hour. Fortunately, they have been peaceful at this point. This, as Alton Sterling's family tries to cope with their sudden loss.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)QUINYETTA MCMILLON, MOTHER OF ALTON'S SON: I, for one, will not rest or not allow him to be swept in the dirt.(EMD VIDEO CLIP)STEGALL: Now, the two Baton Rouge police officers that were involved in this have been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation. An investigation we learned today that is now being led by the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI. Megyn?KELLY: Casey Stegall, thank you. Joining us now with more is Mark Furman, former LAPD homicide detective and Fox News contributor and Andell Brown, a defense and civil rights attorney. Great to see you both. Andell, let me start with you on what you see here because already many people are saying that this was an execution.ANDELL BROWN, DEFENSE AND CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: You know, Megyn, that video's extremely difficult to watch as a man loses his life, a wife loses a husband, and his five children lose a father. What I see is officers approaching him and him with his hands up, seeming to wonder what is he being, you know, approached for. Then I see him being tackled to the ground and officers pinning down his left arm. Two officers are on top of him.What is difficult to see from the videos that I've seen -- I saw both the earlier video and the one that came out later today, is his right hand? I see one of the officers taking control of it for a certain point in time, but then I lose track of it when I see that video. One of the officers says, ""You know, I swear to -- if you don't stop -- if you move.""And then the next thing you hear is some type of scream that you can't make out and gunshots being fired. In the second video it's very clear that you can see that Alton does not seem to have any type of weapon in his hand, but you see him being shot in the chest numerous times, and once again, it's very difficult to watch.KELLY: But Mark, you know, we all have the luxury of sort of this armchair analysis, aren't there in the moment when someone says this guy has a gun and reportedly did have a gun on his person in his pocket, at least according to the initial reports. Your take?MARK FURMAN, FORMER LAPD OFFICER: Well, Megyn, when you look at this, we should talk about what we do know. The officers didn't see this suspect in suspicious behavior and then approach him. They were directed there by a radio call, a citizen was threatened with a weapon.So they go there, and when you watch the escalation of force, first they verbalize and he failed to comply with the verbal commands. They used a taser and that either didn't deploy correctly or didn't hit him correctly, but it was ineffective. Then they actually de-escalated the force that they could have used by tackling and trying to grapple with the suspect.Now, this man has to take responsibility that he did have a gun, and he conducted himself in some manner to draw attention to a citizen who called the police. And after that, the one officer, if this is the way it went down, one officer shot, one officer didn't. When you hear he's got a gun, if the other officer now uses deadly force, it's because he believes that that gun is in the hand or is attempting to be put in the hand of the suspect.KELLY: Andell?BROWN: I mean, I'm not going to say that, you know, I'm not going to cast aspersions on somebody who's not here to defend themselves and say what they, you know, what they thought was happening. When an officer approaches you, I think it's just kind of normal to want to know why exactly am I being told to get on the ground. Why exactly am I being approached in this aggressive manner, and I think many people in the community are on edge because they see these numerous situations and it seems to be a very quick escalation without an opportunity for people to figure out what's going on.He's a CD guy, right. He's out there every day. The owner of the store knows him. They know he's not a bad guy, they know he's not a dangerous guy...KELLY: But the cops don't know. The thing is, the cops don't know any of that and that's...BROWN: I don't (inaudible) people who have permission (ph) in these community know who is, and he's dead. And that's part of the problem. We need people in our community that know the communities they're policing.KELLY: I'm up against a hard break, guys. I got to go. Reverend Jesse Jackson is next. He says this is a public lynching.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Developing tonight, the Department of Justice is already pursuing a civil rights investigation into the death of Alton Sterling. Earlier today civil rights leader Jesse Jackson called this police shooting a public lynching. Reverend Jesse Jackson is the founder and president of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition and my guest now. Reverend, good to see you tonight. This is disturbing, no question about it, and hard to watch, but to those who say...JESSE JACKSON, RAINBOW PUSH COALITON FOUNDER: It is hard to watch.KELLY: But to those who say that you go too far by referring to it in those judgmental terms before we know all the facts, what say you?JACKSON: The fact we do know is a man was on the ground, held down by another police, shot in the back and in the chest, at least four times. He was no threat to police who were involved in that.KELLY: We don't know that. That second part there we don't yet know.JACKSON: We see, the camera is the eye and the eyes tell us that this man is down with no lethal harm to these police or been a threat to them at all. And now the whole world is watching. They didn't have to kill this man. And it's the pattern -- it's so reminiscent of Garner in New York where the police felt they had to choke him to death, that to shoot him four times with no threat to them, it's a rookie.KELLY: Can you tell these officers with prior cases that they had nothing to do with, to ascribe motive to them? I mean, there are defenders who say they were scared, that somebody said he had a gun. They were there because somebody had reported feeling threatened by him and that he had a gun.JACKSON: Well, somebody said is a poor excuse to shoot a man in the back and then the chest four times. That's a poor excuse. That's not good police work (ph).KELLY: But that just what set things are (ph).JACKSON: I see the force was excessive, it was unnecessary, and it was deadly. The only reason -- justification of police shooting someone is they are a threatened themselves, not hearsay, not they say, they killed this man. When I grew up (ph) it was white fleece and covered faces, now it's audaciously blue uniforms.It is a pattern, and I think first the governor should be commended for moving immediately to bring in the FBI and Justice because they at least have more credibility in the situation. The second piece of this is that if he had shot them down on the ground, he would be arraigned tonight, not on administrative leave getting paid.KELLY: Earlier tonight you came out and you called them racist. Now, that's -- that is a bridge too far, is it not? We have no idea what was in those cops' hearts.JACKSON: No, we know the culture, and we know that these two white cops arrived at these conclusions and did not just...KELLY: Come on, come on, that's not fair to these guys. That's not fair.JACKSON: These guys murdered a man who was making...KELLY: Can you have racist to ascribe that sort of a racist motivation to these guys without knowing?JACKSON: No, no, their fears were unfounded and in part the stereotypes of an African-American male. On hearsay, they shot him four times on the ground. And Megyn, in this case it's not hearsay, it's the whole world is watching. So, while we debate this and we trivialize...KELLY: Yeah, they are. I got to leave it at that, sir.JACKSON: ...the whole world is watching. This is a murder and they must be tried.KELLY: They're watching and we'll continue watching and you and I will continue this discussion another time. Very good of you to be here tonight, sir.JACKSON: Indeed.KELLY: All the best. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: What did you make of the Reverend Jesse Jackson's statements right now? Go to facebook.com/thekellyfile, follow me on Twitter @megynkelly. Let me know what you think. Thanks, everyone, for watching. I'm Megyn Kelly. This is ""The Kelly File.""
