And he's gaining on Hillary Clinton in the polls. From his days in the Illinois senate, to the rough and tumble of presidential politics, we'll take an up close look at candidate Barack Obama.Plus, a guilty verdict in the Scooter Libby trial puts President Bush in the hot seat. Will he pardon the former vice presidential aide? And what are the political consequences it if he does?Our panel weighs in after these headlines.(NEWSBREAK)GIGOT: Welcome to the ""Journal Editorial Report."" I'm Paul Gigot.A virtual unknown when he was elected to the United States Senate in 2004, Barack Obama has quickly cultivated a star following that has catapulted him to early and unexpected preeminence in a Democratic field filled with far more seasoned candidates.Just who is this political newcomer? And what do his days in the Illinois State Senate tell us about the kind of president he would be?Joining me now with some home town perspective is Chicago Tribune columnist John Kass.John Kass, welcome to the program. Good to have you here.JOHN KASS, COLUMNIST, CHICAGO TRIBUNE: Thanks for having me.GIGOT: You followed Obama. He's had this extraordinary rise. What is the most important aspect of Obama's character or political philosophy you think Americans should know as a potential president?KASS: He talks about changing the nature of our politics. He talks about ethics and how important that is. And at the same time, he is back here in Chicago by the political machine, the Daley machine, which has its own issues with federal grand injuries.GIGOT: Well, what is...KASS: So there is a disconnect between what America wants in a candidate. I think it is the whole Camelot thing that people want to revisit and seek in terms of Mr. Obama, and the nature of Chicago politics which is not Camelot by any stretch of the imagination.GIGOT: Having lived in Chicago, I can agree with you on that. When you talk about the Daley machine and say that Obama comes out of that machine. What do you mean? And how does it work? Is it a patronage machine, a typical patronage machine? What does it mean he is a product of that politics?KASS: He separates himself from it rhetorically, positioning himself as an independent Democrat.But in Illinois, as you know from your time here, the state senate is basically run by people who tell the other senators what to do. And they generally fall into line.He has done some things in terms of ethics that have separated him from the rest of the pack. He has talked about ethics. He has invoked reform in his speeches.But at the same time, the machine in Chicago is about patronages, as we found out recently. Patrick Fitzgerald the special prosecutor in the Libby case successfully prosecuted top members of the Daley administration for building illegal patronage armies by the thousands.So there is a difference between the Obama message publicly, nationally, and how politics works here. It is all basically very simple here. It is about interests.And Mr. Obama got jammed up into an issue that I don't think has gotten a lot of national play. It is his relationship with an indicted influence peddler here named Tony Risco, and the land they purchased for Obama's home and that will probably trickle out as the days continue.GIGTO: Those associations, you are arguing, will become a political vulnerability as the campaign moves on?KASS: I don't know if they will get national traction, but I think what they suggest, best case scenario, Mr. Boom Obama is a nice man, charismatic, highly intelligent and a decent fellow. But it also suggests that perhaps he is naive. And the issue for the American people, I think, is when you put Obama next to Vladimir Putin in a room talking about whatever they will talk about if he is president, is he seasoned enough to deal with that kind of pressure.GIGOT: What about Obama's political philosophy. Ronald Reagan was a self-identified proud conservative. Bill Clinton called himself a new Democrat Is there any philosophy would you ascribe to Obama's politics?KASS: I would say that basically he is a left of center liberal, doctrinaire in the social positions. He has talked about ethics which I think is part of his campaign.But really you don't he is not a maverick in the sense that the man who -- that his predecessor, Senator Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois, was a maverick, a Republican who defied his own party to bring Patrick Fitzgerald here, for example.Mr. Obama is sort of a -- remember how he was elected. The leading Democratic frontrunner imploded in the domestic violence issue. The Republican frontrunner fell apart when there was a sex scandal. Mr. Obama just came in and basically rode in on these disasters. So he hasn't really had the kind of campaign that he is facing now.GIGOT: Can you think of a single instance in Illinois politics where Obama took on one of the main Democratic interest groups, whether it be teachers' unions or the trail bar or some main interest group, and challenge one of their orthodoxies?KASS: I really can't. I have been wracking my brain. I am sure there might be something. He did stand up for ethics and ethical reform at a time when the Democrats were building their case against the Republic's locally.But when it comes down to it, I don't think he is revolutionary in that regard. I think he's a basically a doctrinaire liberal in that sense.GIGOT: OK, John Kass, thank you for that interesting perspective.KASS: Thank you.GIGOT: Much more on Obama's run when we come back, including a look at some recent polls that surly have the Clinton camp in a sweat.Also ahead, all eyes are on President Bush as he ponders the fate of a former administration aid. We'll make the case for why Scooter Libby should be pardoned now.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT: Senator Hillary Clinton might still is the democratic favorite for the 2008 presidential nomination, but polls show Barack Obama closing the gap.Joining the panel this week, ""Wall Street Journal"" Columnist and Deputy Editor Dan Henninger, as well as Jason Riley and Dorothy Rabinowitz, both ""Wall Street Journal"" editorial board members.Dan, in addition to the national poll that shows Obama gaining about 10 point in a month, we have a poll in New Hampshire that shows that we can put up that shows that primary contest is in the democratic side and statistical dead heat. How do you explain this meteoric rise by Obama?DAN HENNINGER, WSJ COLUMNIST AND DEPUTY EDITOR: My short explanation would be to say that Obama is the ""not"" candidate. He is not Hillary Clinton. And he's not Washington.I don't think can you really over state how disgusted the average person is with politics as usual in this country because, in fact, it is pretty ugly, as we will discuss in the Libby case. This is kind of become business as usual.And Obama has been above the fray. The question in my mind is can he stay above the fray for the next 11 months or so all, the way to the primaries?And secondly, should he remain above the fray. Because if he does so, it sounds as though he is disconnected from the substance of politics.JASON RILEY, WSJ EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: You're right, Dan. It will be very tough for him to do that, particular because, other than the color of his skin, there isn't much to distinguish him in terms of ideology against Hillary Clinton. I mean, they're both big government liberals. Barack's anti-war. He's for more government spending on health care. And down the line, he's for racial preferences.What you will see him doing is playing the typical liberal identity politics. Hillary will talk about breaking the glass ceiling. Obama will talk about breaking racial barriers.DOROTHY RABINOWITZ, WSJ EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: And the first time that Obama strays from that high-minded pursuit of no mud, you will see this immense bacchanalian orgy of press comments, tarring him, saying, ""This is it? He has fallen. He is an ordinary politician."" You cannot be above the fray. Politics is an American sport.GIGOT: But isn't there an inspiration quality here, Jason? You know about the appearance that both Hillary and Obama made in Selma last week on the anniversary of the march. And I listened to Obama, compare to Hillary. He was so much better just to listen, and just to inspire you. And Hillary was kind of earnest and in her way.RILEY: Obama, even though he doesn't come out of that same civil rights tradition, black colleges and so forth -- he's Harvard educated -- he's very comfortable talking to black people.So you put Hillary and Obama in a room addressing blacks and I think Obama is going to come out looking pretty well, which is what you saw.Hillary's challenge here will be going after Obama without alienated her own black supporters. That's going to be very tough to do. Because Hillary needs the black support to win the primary. But needs it to win the general election.GIGOT: She has the support of what you would call the black congressional establishment. I think Charlie Rangel's for her, most of the committee chairmen are for her. What is his relationship with the black establishment?HENNINGER: It's a very interesting point. I think his relationship to them is very threatening. He's a younger guy. He represents a younger generation of black leaders.It has been so hard for people of Obama's generation to gain any presence as black spokesmen in American life. And I think it is very possible that the establishment, the black caucus, will see him as a threat.RILEY: The other thing to remember, Paul, is that in 1984, the Congressional Black Caucus supported Walter Mondale over Jackson for president. And that's was because Mondale was a prot,g, of Hubert Humphrey, who was known as being very favorable among blacks. It didn't do him much good. Let's put it that way. It didn't do Mondale much good.GIGOT: Do you have any doubt he will get more of the black vote than Hillary Clinton in the primaries?RILEY: I have no doubt, no doubt at all. He'll do it.GIGOT: All right, great. Thanks, Jason.Still ahead, the battle lines are forming over a possible pardon for Scooter Libby. What will President Bush do? And what are the political consequences?Our panel weighs in when the ""Journal Editorial Report"" continues.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: On a personal note, I was sad -- I was sad for a man who worked in my administration, and particularly sad for his family.(END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT: That was President Bush reacting to the guilty verdict against former vice presidential aide Scooter Libby.Libby's conviction in federal court on perjury and obstruction of justice charges set off a new debate in Washington, with top Democrats demanding a no-pardon pledge from the president, something White House Press Secretary Tony Snow refused to speculate about.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TONY SNOW, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: All of this conversation, speculation about a pardon, I know makes for interesting speculation, but it is just that. There is a process, you know, and it is it is available to anybody who has been convicted in the United States.(END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT: Dorothy, should President Bush pardon Scooter Libby?RABINNOWITZ: Yes, he should. And he should do it now. And that process that you are talking about is the appeals process.These are the facts. The trial is what brings the facts out. Trials are all about facts. The president cannot pretend that he's going to know anymore during an appeals process. An appeals process is about points of law.There is absolutely no excuse for George Bush not to do as his father did with Cap Weinberger, which his father pardoned Cap Weinberger, at Iran- Contra, before a trial.We have no excuse for the President who knows exactly how much he is to blame for Libby's problems. Not to pardon him because there can be no pretense of anything to be gained by waiting for an appeal.GIGOT: All right.Dan, people say a jury convicted him. He had a fair trial under our system. That's a serious offense. Why not let him serve the punishment?HENNINGER: Well, I think you would have to -- look this was a political event. Scooter Libby was not convicted in Washington for making money for graft, for stealing. It was a wholly political thing.People who come to Washington understand you are putting yourself at some risk. You are always on thin ice in Washington because you can always fall afoul of something like this. And people will use the law against you to try to hammer you. Your opposition will do that.Scooter Libby lost. But I think the grownups of Washington understand that, when somebody gets chewed up like this, that they are entitled to a pardon to put their life back in order. Because if you don't do that -- and I know outsiders will say, oh, I don't under it. Well, they will never understand Washington.GIGOT: And the president I think bears some personal responsibility here because he never really refereed the political disputes and disagreements and, in some cases, insubordination by others in his administration.I mean, Collin Powell and Richard Armitage, the secretary of state, deputy secretary of state, never told the president that they knew who the leaker of the original crime was.RILEY: Right. The administration launched this missile. They allowed Ashcroft, the former attorney general, to recuse himself. And then they allowed for the appointment of Fitzgerald, even though, as you said, they knew -- justice department officials knew that the leaker was Armitage.This is, as Dan said, about the criminalization of politics. And that's bad. That's bad because it brings players into the arena that don't belong there, special prosecutors and judged decided policy disputes, which is not what we do here. We have elections for that and legislatures for that.GIGOT: What about the plan there would be a political backlash, Dorothy, if Bush pardons Libby?RABINOWITZ: Well, that is the point. Here's the president who, if he has one great thing to his favor in terms of his popular supporters, is he is a stand-up guy. He is resolute. And he doesn't really care if he believes he is right.If he fails to pardon Libby at an appropriate time, which is now, but tends to waiver and wait, I think it will be cause for very serious political disappointment.HENNINGER: And you know, there has always been a political backlash. The Democrats are trying to use Scooter Libby as a club to hammer the Republicans. I think if would pardon Libby, it would galvanize the Republican party, because I think Scooter Libby is turning into a Robert Bork-like figure for Republicans.RILEY: And the media would go crazy. But the media have behaved so shamefully in this episode. They spent the past year criticizing Fitzgerald's overreach. But since he produced an outcome that they like, they go, oh, well, that's okay.GIGOT: Quickly, Dan, do you think he will pardon Libby?HENNINGER: You know what? I don't think he will. I think he's too straight laced to do it.GIGOT: Not until the end of his administration, if he does it at all.HENNINGER: Right.GIGOT: I'm sorry to say.All right, we have to take one more break. When we come back, our ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT: Winners and losers, picks and pans, ""Hits and Misses,"" it's our way of calling attention to the best and the worst of the week.Item one, an inch of snow this week brought the nation's Capital to it knees once again -- Dan?HENNINGER: Well, yes it did. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Wednesday said Washington is different from other places. What did he mean? He meant there was an inch, maybe two inches, of snow that was falling and falling and gathering on the ground in Washington.The first thing that happened is that Senator Reid had to cancel a vote on a Homeland Security bill from the morning to the afternoon. A long-scheduled hearing on Bingaman-Specter legislation on global warning was cancelled.You have to have lived in Washington to understand what goes on. When snow gathers on the ground the federal buildings empty out. They jump into their cars. And everyone goes roaring out of the city.I have seen people slam on their brakes, slide through stop signs and red lights. It is just an area of complete panic.And the reason is there are 50 different driving styles in Washington. And so I'm standing shoulder to shoulder with Harry Reid, Washington is a different place.GIGOT: All right, Dan, thanks.Next, a miss to the FCC for holding up the XM-Sirius satellite radio merger -- Jason?RILEY: Yes, FCC Chairman Kevin Martin is one of the people in the way of this merger taking place between these two subscription- based radio services on the ground they would create an monopoly. This is utterly absurd.This combined company would have to compete, first and foremost, with free radio, which 99.9 percent of us still listen to. Then, there's Internet radio stations, which are increasingly popular. Then, there are music channels available through your cable company that people also listen to, and on and on and on. There's no reason to block this merger.GIGOT: All right, Jason, thank you.Finally the network news rating war is becoming downright undignified -- Dorothy?RABINOWITZ: I used to say that you can't trivialize the news anymore than the networks themselves do. But the truth is, it's getting bad. Who's on first? Who's on second? Who's third in the anchor race is now well-known to everybody.I promise you, on the life of my dog, on everything I hold sacred, that this following conversation took place. I asked my doorman, do you know anything about the anchor race? Oh, yes, he said. CBC is last. NBC is behind ABC. And that's why NBC's anchor Brian went off to Iraq.I thought to myself this is going on everywhere -- everywhere. How did this happen?It happened because the networks, where once they would cloak everything in secrecy and with dignity, are now giving huge inside stories about how they are shuffling everybody. Is this the news?GIGOT: I am afraid it is nowadays, Dorothy. Thanks.That's it for this week's edition of the ""Journal Editorial Report."" Send your e-mails to jer@foxnews.com.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Hannity,"" May 25, 2010. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: The massive oil spill in the Gulf is quickly becoming the new third rail in American politics. Its environmental and economic impact will likely be felt for a very long time, and the spill's political impact could be felt through the 2010 midterms and even the 2012 presidential elections.So far throughout the catastrophe, let's see. President Obama has found time to play golf, political fundraisers, state dinners -- oh, that's right -- with Felipe Calderon.And his inaction in recent weeks has enraged not only the people of the Gulf Coast. Believe it or not, even the mainstream Obamamania media is taking some veiled shots at the administration. Let's take a look at this history in the making.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS FROM MAY 24)BRIAN WILLIAMS, HOST, NBC'S ""NIGHTLY NEWS"": The story out of the Gulf of Mexico has not changed in over a month.The anger and despair there are now taking a toll.KATIE COURIC, HOST, CBS' ""EVENING NEWS"": Now the Gulf Coast is waiting. It's a disaster in slow motion like a nightmare where you can see a bad thing coming but are helpless to do anything to stop it.DIANE SAWYER, HOST, ABC'S ""WORLD NEWS TONIGHT"": From the Gulf Coast of Louisiana, last chance. The governor tells the White House and oil company to stop the spill or get out of his way!WILLIAMS: Pressure is building, nonetheless, on the White House to get the government pieces moving, to do more to stop the leak, protect the shoreline from the fallout.(END VIDEO CLIPS)HANNITY: All right. Joining me now with analysis on how this very serious issue could affect the upcoming elections are Fox News contributor Bob Beckel, Republican strategist Noelle Nikpour.Dithering, incompetence, delay. As soon as every beach has that muck on there, Bob, you've got to admit it's a big political problem.BOB BECKEL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: First of all, let me try and clarify something. He hasn't been out of action for 36 days. People who are saying this stuff don't know what they're talking about.And the last guest you had, Stuart Varney, said why don't we get the military down there. What, are they going to take their guns and shoot the slick? This is very complex; it's complicated. Bobby Jindal wants to build an island. Bobby, it takes a few minutes to build an island.NOELLE NIKPOUR, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: You guys, it's been 36 days since the disaster, number one.Number two, have you noticed that Obama has not even declared it a national disaster?BECKEL: Wait a minute, 36 days. Thirty-six days since what? They were there from day one!NIKPOUR: This is not like, I mean, Katrina; this is ongoing. And obviously, he's -- look, even James Carville...BECKEL: I understand.NIKPOUR: ... a noted Democrat strategist, came out and said, ""Look, Obama needs to cut bait and take control over this.""BECKEL: Let me tell you where I think the political problem is. This is -- I think they did the right -- I think they did the right thing in terms of what they could do. What they missed is the political implications of this.And it's not just going to be isolated in the Gulf. I mean, even if it doesn't churn up the East Coast, it's going to be cost of shrimp; it's going to be cost of seafood.It's also, to environmentalists across the country who are furious about it. And so I think, really, they were fine on their actions; not very good on the political side of things.NIKPOUR: But it has lasting implications. Number one, yes, with the environment, of course. And number 2, it's showing, once again, people don't have faith in the government that they're going to take control of anything. Just look. I think it affects the market, as well.BECKEL: Yes, but what -- what would you have them do?NIKPOUR: You've got to be kidding. Just step in.HANNITY: But they've been out there with playing the blame game, Bob. But they gave this -- this particular rig an award for safety. On top of it, they missed inspections.Third thing is, is that as soon as this happened, they knew immediately it was going to be massive. And their lack of action in terms of helping and supporting and getting people that have knowledge on the ground and the equipment on the ground, they haven't done that.BECKEL: That's just -- first of all, nobody was going to know what was going to happen on this thing. And they did -- within hours they had booms out there.NIKPOUR: Then they should know something is wrong.BECKEL: And I was involved in putting the legislation together on this, by the way, after the Valdez. And it was very clearly marked out, Congress agreed that the company who had -- had this catastrophe would take the lead, and the rest of the United States government would do what they could. The Coast Guard's been out there...NIKPOUR: Do what they could? That's unacceptable. They need to do something now.BECKEL: Have you ever been around an oil slick before?NIKPOUR: No. Have I been around an oil slick?BECKEL: Well, I'm telling you...NIKPOUR: Have you been around an oil slick?BECKEL: I have been around an oil slick.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: What are you going swimming in an oil slick every weekend, Bob?BECKEL: Well, I used to -- I used to swim in the hot water of a nuclear power plant, which may be why I'm so liberal.NIKPOUR: This is what the problem is.HANNITY: That may explain a lot.BECKEL: But I'm telling you, this thing is, people are fast to shoot -- to take pot shots about this. It's very difficult to do.NIKPOUR: Fast? No, we're not fast to take pot shots. It's been 36 days.BECKEL: But what are you supposed to do?(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Hang on a second. Let me add one point.Bob, I'm telling you, there is a growing cloud around the presidency. When you have James Carville, Mr. Thrill-Up-My-Leg Chris Matthews and you have all these Democratic congressmen and women distancing themselves from this, you've got a political problem.BECKEL: I just -- I just said...NIKPOUR: He doesn't want to take blame because, in 2012, we're still going to be cleaning up this mess. And he knows that that's re-elect time, and he doesn't want to have this become his catastrophe.HANNITY: It already is his Katirna.BECKEL: I'm glad you got that talking point in on that one about 2012. I knew you were waiting -- waiting for that.Look, I agreed. I said that there was a political problem here, and it's a growing problem. What is not fair is that they didn't do anything. I know what they were doing; they did a lot of stuff. But what they didn't do, I would have just sent 10,000 boats down there.HANNITY: All right. We've got to run in a second. Well, he didn't show up at Nashville, either.But here's the next question. Do you believe the White House has handled the Sestak matter well?BECKEL: I think they've handled it as well as you're going to -- I mean, I don't see what the big deal is. They didn't want the guy to run against Specter, so what do you do? Let's be honest.HANNITY: That's against the law, Bob.BECKEL: No, it's not against the law if you handle it right.NIKPOUR: It's unethical.HANNITY: Look at your face. You don't even believe what you're saying.BECKEL: I don't know -- I'm serious. I don't know what the big deal is.HANNITY: We've got to run.BECKEL: I mean, this happens in politics all the time. Where their mistake was, why they wanted Specter as opposed to Sestak in the first place. They should have offered Specter a job.NIKPOUR: Well, we want Toomey.HANNITY: Let me...BECKEL: Toomey, yes, there -- Sominex sales plummet when that guy talks.HANNITY: We've got to -- we've got to go.-- Watch ""Hannity"" weeknights at 9 p.m. ET!Content and Programming Copyright 2010 Fox News Network, Inc.
