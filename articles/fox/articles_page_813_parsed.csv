This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARK PRYOR, D-AR.: He has voted against our seniors. He has voted against our students. He has voted against our women. And he has also voted against working families all over the state of Arkansas. And at the end of the day, that's for one simple reason, so that he can give his billionaire backers enormous tax breaks.REP. TOM COTTON, R-AR.: A vote for Mark Pryor is a vote for Barack Obama. Mark Pryor votes with Barack Obama 93 percent of the time. I don't know how many Arkansans who agree with Barack Obama 93 percent of the time.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: That's the Arkansas race. The two candidates there, you can take a look at the Real Clear Politics average of the latest polls, and you can see it's essentially tied in Arkansas. And there you see the Republican Tom Cotton in the RCP average. There is a new poll ""USA Today"" poll out that has Mark Pryor up slightly but essentially tied again. We are back with our panel. We ask the panelists to choose one of these races that intrigues them to talk about. George, we will start with you.GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: There are Senate races and five purple states this year, Virginia, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Colorado, and Iowa, and much the closest is Iowa. Braley and Ernst are the Democrat and Republican, one-tenth of one percent apart the Real Clear Politics average of polls. It shouldn't be this close really. Granted Iowa has voted Democratic in six of the last seven presidential elections, but Barack Obama's approval rating is only 38 percent in Iowa.The Democrats have two ideas this year and they're the same two in Iowa. One is that the Republicans are waging a war on women, two, which Joanie Ernst is a five foot, two inch, 44 year old grandmother who packs a pistol, rides a Harley, and served in Iraq and Kuwait, says I'm a woman and I have been in war and this isn't war, which is a pretty good answer.And with regard to the idea -- the other Democratic idea is the Koch brothers, the big money. Well, Tom Steyer, who opposes the Keystone pipeline, is running ads named Braley but supporting Braley by attacking Joanie Ernst, Braley who has changed his position in the last two years on the Keystone pipeline, and Steyer has run $2.6 million of negative ads against Joanie Ernst which is a lot of money in the Iowa media market.BAIER: Speaking of Iowa, so the FOX poll is tied at 41 percent. The Rasmussen poll is tied at 42 percent. OK, Mara, your choice?MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: I pick North Carolina. The Democrats have to hang on to North Carolina. If they lose Arkansas, Alaska, and Louisiana, in addition to the three open seats, they have got to hang on to North Carolina and get one other seat. The interesting thing about North Carolina, unlike these other states, it's truly purple. Barack Obama won it in 2008, narrowly lost it in 2012. And the Democrats have spent tremendous amount of time and money building an infrastructure to get out the vote there. And I think North Carolina will be a great test of the vaunted Democratic field operation to see if they can get all those newcomers to North Carolina, educated, young, upscale whites and African-Americans to the polls. The polls there are very close. I think this is a race that this year the Democrats should lose. I mean in North Carolina.BAIER: Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I'm choosing New Hampshire. We have Jeanne Shaheen, the incumbent, the Democrat, a popular governor, still ahead of Scott Brown, the former senator of Massachusetts. But he has gained a lot. He was way behind a few months ago. The interesting thing, and he is probably still a long shot here, but the polls, he's only two points behind. On the RCP average he's behind by about five, but on one of the late polls, two behind. He isn't only relying on the anti-Obama sentiment and on the lousy economy, but he has pioneered for Republicans attack ads on two issues. Immigration, he jumped on that, which is an issue that has flipped. It was a Democratic issue. It now works against them. And he's also begun running ads on ISIS, the war on terror, the general sense Americans have of weakness. It will be interesting to see how much that's going to help him. He has sort closed the gap, again, tough to win. He is from out of state. He isn't exactly their cup of tea, and Shaheen is inherently popular. But he may have latched on to the issues that might swing this.BAIER: We will take this show on the road to Louisiana talking to Senator Mary Landrieu the incumbent, Bill Cassidy, the Republican, Rob Maness, another Republican in that race. Quickly, George, a few seconds here, Kansas -- the FOX polls in Kansas have Orman up on Roberts. Orman is the independent, and it looks like that could be a race that decides the whole thing.WILL: The Democrat has dropped out. It's a two-person race and Orman is probably up by about five right now. He is 45. Pat Roberts, who has been in Washington as a staffer or something else since the 60's, is 78. And it's now probably Orman's to lose.Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2014 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Congress passed a bill which gutted what the NSA is doing in terms of metadata and did this confusing thing that even the phone companies don't understand.  They were not bugging people's personal messages.  This was just looking for patterns, so get rid of it.  The other thing they have to do is have these devices, these computers be easy to unlock for law enforcement if they have a warrant because of suspicious activity.  Bruce Japsen:  I think this could be an issue whether we have the tools we need to do this. Jane Harman, the former Democratic House Intelligence Committee Chair, she said, ""Policy makers have been slow to adapt, spies would rather still squint at satellite photos than scrape Facebook posts and that's a big problem.  Rich Karlgaard: Since Steve is absolutely right about this, we've disembowel the NSA.  We can thank Senator Cruz and Senator Paul for being on the wrong side of this issue.  We also need to be better at propaganda.  FDR and Reagan were really good at telling the story of the good guys, and we're not doing this.   John Tamny:  I find it horrifying that we would give up even more liberty to a political class that almost felt unanimously that we need to get rid of Saddam Hussein such that we have ISIS to begin with.  I think we have to go back to the 80s and ask if our meddling in Afghanistan gave us Al Qaeda.  At some point do we say that the federal government trying to keep us safe is actually making us less safe?Elizabeth MacDonald:  Senator Dianne Feinstein said they needed the Senate Intelligence Bill that would have said to Facebook and Twitter, just tell us if you see terrorist activity on websites.  We're not asking them to monitor it, the law absolutely did not say to Facebook, Twitter, and social media, you have to monitor.  It just said, just like child pornography, if you see it, report it to us.  This is no longer an Al Qaeda top down structure, a command control structure, they're self-radicalizing.  ISIS is using social media to issue battlefield commands.  That's a total new world we're in.  Sabrina Schaeffer:  I think we need smarter roles, that's where there is sometimes a disconnect sometimes.  Social media companies are not law enforcement agencies.  It think we often forget how wonderful it is that ISIS and other terrorists are on these very cooperative companies that are open, transparent, and that are working with law enforcement.  If we make it so difficult for them to use Facebook or Twitter or any of the other social media platforms, they will go underground to other social media platforms that are not as transparent, not mainstream and harder for us to monitor.  I think we want to be careful not to sort of suggest that more data is necessarily better.  We will find all sorts of correlations that's not real puzzle information for us.    NY DAILY NEWS RIPS GOP POLITICIANS FOR OFFERING 'PRAYERS' TO CALIFORNIA SHOOTING VICTIMSSteve Forbes:  This was thoughtless, insensitive, offensive and it shows just how out of touch some people are with the world today.  You try to be thoughtful, offer prayers and you got smacked in the face like that, this just shows the sour nature of our times.  Shame on the Daily News.Bruce Japsen:  I think people are generally frustrated.  They want something done about gun control.  They want something done about the mental health crisis in this country.  I think we're talking about it.  Maybe a conversation starter might not have been the way to go.  We don't want to insult people.  John Tamny:  The Daily News is rude, obnoxious and also misleading.  This is what the left so often do.  They turn anecdote and try to create fact or trends from it.  In fact, the trend from the United States over the last 20 years is that gun violence has gone down.  John Lott has made the point that the more there is gun ownership in places, the less there is gun violence.  They're trying to make an argument that has nothing to do with the reality.  Elizabeth MacDonald:  They're a real crass act over there.  Really reckless and exploitive.  This is the same newspaper that put on its front page at the moment of death the moment the journalist that was shot on camera by that fellow coworker in Virginia.  This is a shame that they did this.  It wasn't right, and it shows really poor judgement.  Sabrina Schaeffer:  I think the real headline here is that a place like the Daily News continues to think of this incident in San Bernardino as if it was a random act of violence.  More and more we're seeing at best it was inspired by ISIS and radical Islam and it may have been in fact directed by that.  That's the real headline.  That's the real atrocity of the Daily News this week.  Rich Karlgaard:  On the ground as the shooting was still unfolding, people were engaged in prayer.  To mock that I think is a low blow.  But the secular left, including the Daily News and many of the competitors of this station.  You could almost see them hoping when these things happen.  It'll be Timothy McVeigh and they're so disappointed when it turns out to be Jihadists.  REPORT: WHITE HOUSE TELLS PENTAGON TO FIND CHEAPER WAY TO CLOSE GITMORich Karlgaard:  I'm totally pro Gitmo because I think Gitmo should be a symbol for the world to see.  That America's civil liberties do not apply to enemy combatants of the U.S.  Bruce Japsen:  I personally think we should close it because it reminds me of Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld.  I read this week that it cost $80,000 to house someone in a super maximum security facility a year.  I think we need to look at this whole situation.Elizabeth MacDonald:  I'm with Rich, keep it open.  These are enemy combatants.  We are at war.  We have to wipe these guys out.  We have to get rid of ISIS.  Congress just passed a law that said, you can't transfer these terrorists to U.S. soil.  John Tamny:  What I don't think we should do is close it because we want to please people around the world or boost our standing.  Let's close it only if it makes us safe for doing so.  Steve Forbes:  The idea that President Obama would be concerned about a mere $500 million is preposterous.  That's chump change in that town.  What you have is election year politics.  He's going to put off a decision until after the elections because he knows that it's going to be a bad one.  He'll try to close it between November of next year and January of 2017.  The other thing you have to watch for with this guy, even though it's against a treaty, is he might try to turn Guantanamo back to Cuba.
