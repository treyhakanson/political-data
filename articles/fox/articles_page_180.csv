8	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/09/30/donald-trump-returns-to-factor/	Donald Trump returns to 'The Factor'	"This is a RUSH transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" September 29, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: Continuing now with our lead story, Donald Trump returning to The Factor. As you may remember a man in New Hampshire asked Mr. Trump some questions about Muslims which he did not answer directly. That caused the media to go nuts.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In a country that is very armed, that will be carrying weapon will go to a mosque tomorrow or after tomorrow and will start shooting people. And then these people will have blood on their hands, all of them -- Carson, Trump, and --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Two points here --(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: All right. Rejoining us now from New York City Donald Trump. What do you say to that? Somebody shoots up a mosque you are responsible.TRUMP: Well, I think it's terrible what is going on. I can tell you in New York City they used to go in and check and do a lot of different things and now they are not doing any checking and I think frankly the question that was asked of me in New Hampshire which was a packed house and a lot of enthusiasm, I just didn't want to respond to the question.And it's the first time I have ever been sort of made controversial by not responding to a question. But they wanted me to defend President Obama and he can defend himself. I don't have to defend Obama.O'REILLY: Ok. But I mean look, the media is not going to give you a fair shake and they are just not. That brings us to me --TRUMP: That's true.01: -- me and you. You're on record as saying that I have been fair to you. And I believe I have.So let me ask you a couple of questions. And if they're unfair, you tell me if they're unfair.TRUMP: All right.O'REILLY: Am I fair to say in order for you to win the Republican nomination that you are going to have to change your style and be a bit kindler and more mature? Is that a fair question?TRUMP: Well, I think it's fair. I think the word ""mature"" is not appropriate. But I think it's certainly fair. I think that you know, as you know, I'm leading every poll and most polls I'm leading very big in New Hampshire, in Iowa. If you look at what just came down, South Carolina the polls -- all number one. So I can't be so doing so badly.But it's not going to be a question of nice. I think I'm a nice person. I have great relationships. You know me well. I help people, I love people. But it's not going to be a question of that. It's going to be a question of competence because people are tired of being pushed around by every country in the world.O'REILLY: And that's why you're doing well. You have to be kind of presidential. I'm going to run a clip now of something you recently said and then I'm going to ask you another question which may be unfair. If it is you tell me. Roll the tape.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: You have this clown Marco Rubio. I have been so nice to him. I have been so nice. I have been so nice.And then -- no, but he is in favor of immigration and he has been. He has been. It was the Gang of Eight. And you remember the Gang of Eight. It was terrible.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: All right. Now, would I be unfair to say to you, which I would if we were at a Yankee game, hey, calling Senator Rubio a ""clown"" was not presidential?TRUMP: No, I don't think it would be unfair but I have to tell you how that all started. I was getting along with him perfectly fine two weeks ago. Everything was fine. I don't really know him. And then all of a sudden he attacks me about nothing. But really attacked me quite viciously and I fought back. I told people that he has one of the worst voting records. He has the worst voting record in the senate. He never shows up. I mean he's not going in for votes and that, you can't do.He is weak on immigration. Unbelievably weak on immigration. And I'm all about strong on illegal immigration and other things. So I mentioned it and I said it loudly. But again, I'm a counter puncher. He hit me all of a sudden.(CROSSTALK)O'REILLY: Ok. And I didn't mind the Gang of Eight stuff.TRUMP: Rand Paul was so nice.O'REILLY: I didn't mind the Gang of Eight stuff. It's calling him a ""clown"" that's not presidential.TRUMP: He was a member of the Gang of Eight.O'REILLY: All right. Final question.TRUMP: Ok, listen. Excuse me -- Bill.O'REILLY: Go ahead.TRUMP: He was a member of the Gang of Eight which was a disaster. He was totally weak on immigration.O'REILLY: But that's fine.TRUMP: And by the way he hasn't changed.O'REILLY: But it's the clown stuff that's not fine. Last question.TRUMP: Well, ok. I can understand that.O'REILLY: Ok, good.TRUMP: But he hit me very viciously.O'REILLY: But on policy.He -- you have the highest unfavorables in the polls. All right? More people don't like you than any other candidate. Is it fair to ask you why you think that is?TRUMP: Well, I also have the highest positives in the poll. That's why I'm reading every poll.O'REILLY: Remember Howard?TRUMP: It's a combination.O'REILLY: It was like Howard Cosell.TRUMP: I think you can see this. I have done very well over the last number of months in terms of getting the unfavorables much better. If you look at New Hampshire, I'm doing great with respect to favorable, unfavorable. Very positive. Iowa, the places that I'm going to a lot, South Carolina, I'm doing great in that category.So I think when people see me, when they see I want to make America great again. They all of a sudden say, you know, we really like him. I'm actually a nice person.O'REILLY: You are going to grow on everybody? You are going to grow on us then? You're going to grow on us.TRUMP: Well, when I go to Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina they really like me and my favorables are great there because they see me a lot.O'REILLY: I got it. The more they see you, the more they are going to like you.Now, fair interview?TRUMP: For whatever reason.O'REILLY: Everything fair? Are we good?TRUMP: You were very fair. You are always fair.O'REILLY: Yes, yes, yes.TRUMP: Almost.O'REILLY: Almost, I know. Ok, and we appreciate you coming on.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.
