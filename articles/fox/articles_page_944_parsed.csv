This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.HOWARD KURTZ, HOST: On our buzzmeter from Los Angeles this Sunday, Donald Trump after weeks of being pummeled by the press shakes up his campaign team. A move quickly dismissed by the pundits.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PAUL BEGALA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: First off, I'm always new for deck chairs on the Trump-tanic, OK, and that's what this is. The problem is Donald Trump. It's never Mr. Corey, it's not Mr. Manafort, it's not these new people. It's the candidate, stupid.BILL KRISTOL, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: I don't think it matters because the problem is Donald Trump, you know.GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS: So did he hire someone who will broaden his appeal or just a mirror that indulges his worst impulses? Given that the Breitbart site of late has embraced conspiracies, I worry.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: With Paul Manafort resigning after some damaging stories in New York Times, will hiring the executive chairman of Breitbart, the controversial and fiercely pro-Trump website help the campaign? And the media remains skeptical about Trump's tone.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Sometimes in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don't choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that and believe it or not I regret it.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: As journalists question whether this new approach will last. Hillary Clinton accused by Trump of lacking the mental and physical stamina to fight ISIS -- is the press calling foul on making her health an issue?Comedy Central cancels Larry Wilmore's late night show. Can the network no longer make comedy gold out of politics?Plus, should the press have fallen for Ryan Lochte's bogus burglary story?I'm Howard Kurtz and this is ""MediaBuzz.""Donald Trump insisted he wasn't going to pivot. He wasn't going to change. And he seemed to make that clear by hiring Stephen Bannon, the chairman of the vehemently pro-Trump conservative website, Breitbart. But the more immediate impact seemed to come from the topic of a new campaign manager, veteran pollster Kellyanne Conway who is popular with reporters and is touting Trump's speech in which he said he regretted causing anyone personal pain.(BEGN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID MUIR, ABC NEWS: He mentioned anyone who's been personally offended by what he said, will he reach out to the Khan family personally?KELYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: He may, but I certainly hope that they heard him last night. And I certainly hope America heard him last night because of all the people, David, who've been saying let's get Trump to pivot, let's get him to be more presidential, that is presidential.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Joining us now from New York, Amy Holmes, political analyst for Rasmussen Reports and former anchor at ""The Blaze."" In Washington, Heidi Przybyla, senior political correspondent for USA Today. And here in Los Angeles, Leslie Marshall, radio host and Fox News contributor. Heidi, when Manafort stepped down in the wake of the big shakeup, you could see the spin evolve during the day -- talk about spin cycle.First it was, oh, Manafort volunteered to do this, it was his idea, he brought in Kellyanne. He felt like he couldn't budge the candidate. And then other sources were heard from. Explain what happened.HEIDI PRZYBYLA, USA TODAY: Howie, this just struck me as just another example of Trump being pressured to use what is really a conventional campaign tactic and by the end saying, the heck with it. The dignified way for campaign managers or anybody else really on a campaign to leave is for everybody to agree it was voluntary, Trump issues the statement saying we accept his resignation and then the media moves on.Maybe they write some background stories about people who are disgruntled. But like you said, this was literally evolving minute by minute, and you had Kellyanne, the new campaign manager essentially confirming that he was asked to leave. So, it's not that these things can't be mutually -- it's not that these things are mutually exclusive that both sides could have, you know, agreed mutually to leave, but I think this is an example of what happens when you have really competing interests trying to spin the narrative here.Clearly, Manafort wanted to, you know, preserve his dignity on the way out the door and Trump didn't want this to be viewed as a hemorrhaging.KURTZ: You can practically imagine the reporters scrambling to reach more sources on pro-Manafort, some anti-Manafort and get some approximation of the truth. So Amy Holmes, it seems to me that the -- when the shakeup happened, off course it's a bombshell of a story for the campaign, the pundits immediately reacted by kind of being disdainful saying it doesn't really matter because Trump is the problem. Was that a bit dismissive?AMY HOLMES, RASMUSSEN REPORTS: I think it was and we've seen since Donald Trump hiring Kellyanne Conway that he has been making this presidential pivot. Ironically after firing the guy that said it was going to happen, it's happened under Kellyanne becoming the new campaign manager. We'll see if it lasts. And I, you know, Donald Trump we know has been a very volatile candidate. And of course he deserves media scrutiny, but I think he also deserves credit for at least making these initial attempts.KURTZ: But mostly I would say the press was either puzzled by this, Leslie Marshall, or negative toward it. I know you're no Trump fan, but how much of the coverage do you think was influenced by the increasingly hostile tone in the press about Donald Trump and his candidacy?LESLIE MARSHALL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think quite frankly any time Trump opens his mouth everybody would cover it because he's good for ratings. I mean, that's the reality and that's a real bottom line. I don't think Trump had any disservice. We have to look historically this is probably the most shakeup we've seen in a presidential campaign, at least in the most current elections in modern day.And I think there was also -- I mean, there was additional element. It wasn't just that he was taking a nose dive in the polls and making yet another change in his campaign staff, but there were also the connections with Russia and the Ukraine and even the question of legality. I heard some historians say back in the day this would be treason and somebody would be hung for this.KURTZ: We'll come back to the Manafort question. Let me get Heidi in on this question. So, we played it at the top with Trump giving a scripted speech in which he says he regrets some of his past comments, and I think it would be fair to say most of the press reaction was skeptical, did he really mean it or was he being fed these lines?PRZYBYLA: There was definitely some skepticism. And some of it even bordered on snark. I saw one story that said, well, it wasn't really an apology because he didn't say the word sorry. But at the same time, there are some legitimate reasons for skepticism here. Most of all this is just not in character for Trump because he's been asked along the way as he's made these controversial comments if he regrets them and each time he said no.It also coincides almost perfectly with Kellyanne coming in as his new campaign manager knowing that she wanted to give him -- to soften up his image a bit. So, you question whether that's coming legitimately from his heart or from her from a campaign perspective. That said, you know, he did say the words and it was a pretty big deal.KURTZ: Right. Right. Well, Kellyanne Conway said in one of her many interviews this week that Donald Trump went over the speech with a pen. It wasn't her words. Of course she's going to say that. Amy, what about the fact that the media, look, let's face it, the media were stunned because Trump never apologizes for anything, although he wasn't specific about which comments and to whom he might be expressing regret.HOLMES: Right and Donald Trump himself has said that, you know, it's a part of his sort of life strategy to always hit back and always retaliate, never let a charge go unanswered. So for him to now be offering what seemed to be an apology of course was newsworthy and news making.But for the press to immediately dismiss it and psychoanalyze Donald Trump, I don't think that's fair either. And at ""Rasmussen Reports"" this week, we released a poll that found 52 percent of likely voters think that the media -- that Hillary Clinton has got the best media coverage so far in this campaign.KURTZ: So, the related question here is, you know, we've been through the sort of mini pivots before where Trump gives a couple scripted speeches, everyone says, OK, now he's a more disciplined candidate and it doesn't last. So, is the journalistic skepticism on this round justified?MARSHALL: I think it is absolutely justified. When you have someone who says, you know, and just historically, when you look back somebody just says, you know, I'm concerned if I've hurt anyone. Like you had said, there is, one, no actual specific apology, two, there are no specifics to who he has offended and what he feels remorseful or, you know, has regret about.And, I mean, this is the man that talked about punching Michael Bloomberg in the face. This is a man who cared about himself after the Orlando terrorist attacks and also felt that a man whose son died for this country was attacking him, and then attacks the mother for...KURTZ: You can certainly criticize Trump's response (inaudible). Everybody thinks it's a political mistake, but he was denounced by Khizr Khan at the Democratic convention. Let me move on and come back to this question about Paul Manafort who lasted I guess about four months or so as the Trump campaign manager.The New York Times, Heidi, did this big piece, it was a first of several pieces about his ties, you know, the guy's been a lobbyist for years to Ukraine and how ledgers were discovered that seemed to show $12 million in cash being earmarked for Paul Manafort.Manafort's vehemently denied that he ever received any of that money. He denounced New York Times. What do you make of that story? Didn't prove he got the payments. Was that story fair?PRZYBYLA: Yeah, I took a good read over that story again, Howie, and here's my assessment. I think this is a good example where the narrative really kind of makes this story versus the specific facts in this story because, you know, going into this, we all know that Manafort had ties to big Russian money and to Yanukovych in particular who is really as corrupt as they come.And so going into that, you know, we kind of have that preformed confession. And then you look at the actual facts, well, these are handwritten ledgers -- it's basically an assertion. It's an assertion from a Ukrainian agency that we're not familiar with, and Manafort could easily deny it. So, you know, even lower down in the story, the investigators had said that there was no proof he actually received the money.So, that kind of brings us back to why is this news? Well, this is news because of what we knew previously which is that there is a relationship between these two men that is troubling in and of itself because of who Yanukovych is.KURTZ: You know, a lot of people in the press jumped to the conclusion, Amy, that it was these stories about the Russian ties and the Ukrainian relationship that sunk Paul Manafort. I'm told by my sources that Donald Trump while not happy about that distraction, was much more upset with the story we talked about last Sunday which was big leaky New York Times piece headline, ""Inside the Failed Mission to Tame Donald Trump's Tongue."" His own advisor saying he's not coachable and perhaps he concluded that Manafort's fingerprints were fairly on that piece.HOLMES: Well, I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case, that Donald Trump did not like having these leaks in the press that he can't be tamed. But I think getting back to the Russia story, part of also what fueled the media coverage of that is that it dovetailed with the Vladimir Putin/Donald Trump seeming bromance and the kind words they've had for each other.But if you look at these articles too, you notice buried way down in the print was that the Podesta Group, that's Tony Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager's brother, they're also under scrutiny. But looking at the MSM, the mainstream media, you would think that it was only about Paul Manafort.KURTZ: Right. I just want to close this segment asking you, Leslie, about just the volume, the gusher of anti-Trump stories and headlines compared to those involving Hillary Clinton -- ""Political, Regretful Trump Pivots 107 Days Late."" New York Times, ""And Trump's Empire Hazy Ties $650 Million in Debt,"" also, ""GOP Worries Falling Trump Tide Will Lower All Boats."" But then this ""Washington Post"" piece today on the front page, ""With a Comfortable Lead, Clinton Begins Laying Plans for her White House Agenda,"" almost as if the race were over.MARSHALL: Well, I've said it before, I don't think its right for any outlet not to be reporting all the facts. That's what a true journalist or journalistic source should do. But I do think, again, that quite frankly, dirt on Donald, anything about Donald just is more attractive to readers and to viewers and to listeners than information about Hillary Clinton. And so if it bleeds it leads, or if it has Donald Trump's name in it, it leads.KURTZ: Right, which of course, if that's true, totally unbalances the coverage, and before we go to break, I saw (ph) the New York Daily News cover supposedly Trump saying, ""I'm Gonna Lose So Good!"" This piece actually says that his shakeup could be an intentional effort to tank the election in spectacular fashion. Talk about a completely unsupported paroxysm of speculation. All right, let me get a break. You can write to us mediabuzz@foxnews.com. Let me know what you think on Twitter on @HowardKurtz.And when we come back, a closer look at the controversial Breitbart media operation that produced the Trump campaign's new CEO. And later, the passing of John McLaughlin who influenced much of what you see today on cable news.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Steve Bannon has taken plenty of hits in the press since Donald Trump tapped him as campaign CEO. Bannon is a former Goldman Sachs guy who became chairman at Breitbart, the conservative news site founded by the late Andrew Breitbart.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL KRISTOL, WEEKLY STANDARD EDITOR: I mean, the fact that it's called Breitbart news. They changed the name and call it, you know, right wing intolerant, mean-spirited news, that would be fine.DANA LOESCH, RADIO AND TV HOST: But all I know is that one of the worst people on God's green earth was just instituted as the chairman and CEO of the Trump campaign.COREY LEWANDOWSKI, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: If you look at Stephen Bannon and what they've built at Breitbart, its win at all costs, and I think that really makes some people on the left very afraid because they're willing to say and do things that others in the mainstream media wouldn't do.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Amy, it's clear that a lot of people out there don't like -- in journalism -- don't like Steve Bannon. Now, Breitbart has been accused of running a fan site with lots of stories like, ""The Ten Most Important Reasons Donald Trump Would Make a Great President."" So what does Bannon's hiring say about Breitbart and the Trump campaign?HOLMES: Well, it says that Donald Trump likes breitbart.com and for many journalists it confirms to them that breitbart.com has been sort of a propaganda vehicle for Donald Trump's candidacy. What I think is more interesting about all of this of course is the internecine warfare on the right that is once again being exposed and believe me, the media, there's nothing they love more than -- other than a sex scandal, which is Republicans fighting each other.KURTZ: Leslie, Bannon dismisses the notion that his site traffics an ugly rhetoric, but in leaked e-mails to a colleague that were obtained by the ""Daily Beast""-- maybe you saw this, he calls the GOP leaders in congress a bunch of C words and says we should all go buck wild. So, he has very strong opinions often expressed through the site.MARSHALL: Yeah, and Breitbart's site, quite frankly, has been very pro- Trump. As a matter of fact, they even threw one of their own employees in a sense, under the train to defend him, or under the bus, I guess I should say. When we look at that site, I mean, the problem is they defend Trump at all cost and as we know without facts many times.And we see that most recently just in the state of Louisiana when the governor says, look, if the president came here it would be a disaster and a nightmare for first responders. That we don't hear about, but we do hear about Trump and Pence making a trip there in that state.KURTZ: By the way we invited Breitbart to make a representative available for the show and the website declined. Heidi, so if Steve Bannon had been advising Trump sort of informally and now he leaves Breitbart to become the campaign CEO but he's on a leave of absence so, he will probably go back to Breitbart, does that mean the site's credibility is taking a hit? I mean, what are people to think when they read Breitbart's coverage now with the former chairman running the Trump campaign?PRZYBYLA: I think what's happening, Howie, is that his audience is basically seeing what the impression has been within the media industry all along, which is that Breitbart is essentially the Trump news network. What's hurtful are also these stories coming out now saying that basically, you know, staffers are accusing Breitbart of even unproven allegations about taking money for positive coverage where Trump directly overruling editors.And, yeah, if that comes to a point now where that is not just the impression within the media community but also among Breitbart's audience, I think that that could be problematic for them.KURTZ: Right.PRZYBYLA: And to me the big irony here is that the founder of Breitbart, Andrew Breitbart, had such utter disdain for that type of cozy relationship between journalists and the politicians that they cover for now many conservative commentators to now be accusing Breitbart of being essentially Pravda, like the Russian-owned news network.KURTZ: What Leslie was referring to about an employee being thrown under the bus was the infamous Michelle Fields incident when she was grabbed by former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and Breitbart actually came with the story that took the Trump's side. Whatever you think of that incident, whether it was overblown, and a lot of people quit as a result of that.And finally, Washington Post story today calls Steve Bannon's hiring by the Trump campaign, ""the latest sign for white nationalists, once dismissed as fringe that their world view was gaining popularity."" So, I'm sure Breitbart defenders will feel like that is a little bit of overheated rhetoric. All right, Leslie Marshall here in L.A., Amy Holmes in New York, Heidi Przybyla in D.C., thanks very much for joining us this Sunday.Up next, was the press too quick to fall for Ryan Lochte's claim of being burglarized at gunpoint at the Olympics? And later, bankrupt, auctioned off, shutdown -- the demise of Gawker.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Ryan Lochte is belatedly expressing regret for creating international scandal. The Olympic swimmer made headlines around the world when he gave NBC this account of what happened to him in Rio.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KEIR SIMMONS, NBC NEWS: Ryan Lochte was on today, Friday morning within 48 hours he had a gun put to his head.RYAN LOCHTE, UNITED STATES OLYMPIC SWIMMER: They pulled us over. They pulled out their guns. They told the other swimmers to get down on the ground -- I'm not kidding. Down on the ground. And then the guy pulled out his gun. He tapped it, put it to my forehead and said get down. I put my hands up, I was like whatever.SIMMONS: Lochte stood up to these guys. Honestly, that was a brave and dangerous thing to do.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: But Lochte changed some crucial details in a follow-up interview with Matt Lauer. And then yesterday in yet another interview, he backed off a bit more.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MATT LAUER, NBC NEWS: The first version of the story you told, Ryan, was much more about the mean streets of Rio.LOCHTE: Yeah.LAUER: And the version we're hearing now is much more about a negotiated settlement to cover up some dumb behavior.LOCHTE: And that's why I'm taking full responsibility for it. It is because I over-exaggerated that story.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Joining us now here in Los Angeles, Kim Serafin, a commentator, actress, senior editor for In Touch Weekly magazine and a one-time aide to Rudy Giuliani. All right, so let's start with Lochte. This was not an over exaggeration. This was not being less than candid. This was a lie, a complete and total lie. And now in two successive interviews with NBC, he appears unwilling or unable to admit that.KIM SERAFIN, IN TOUCH WEEKLY SENIOR EDITOR: Yeah, well, obviously he now had some coaching. He hired a big crisis communication expert and that's why he went and did that sit-down interview with Matt Lauer. More is going to air on the ""Today"" show on Monday so, we'll hear a little bit more. Look, this is par for the course.When you get into trouble, you try to make amends. When you do an interview, you do this apology interview and then you hope you don't lose your endorsement deals, which could be $5 million to $10 million.KURTZ: Making amends. I'm sorry. I lied. I shouldn't have lied. It was a really bad thing to do. I mean, these weasel words I think are not cutting it, crisis communications or not. This is the classic non-apology apology.SERAFIN: It's true, and he did say he was immature -- it was immature behavior. He over exaggerated. One thing I think that a lot of people are talking about is when Matt Lauer said, ""So, are you willing to now say it wasn't robbery?"" because that was really the one point, It was robbery. We were the victims in this whole thing.And Matt really gave him that opening to say are you willing now to say that it wasn't robbery. And then he kind of said, well, it could be robbery, it could have been making amends and restitution and then...KURTZ: Well, I kind of felt threatened because the guy had a gun. Originally, they were in a taxi. They were pulled out by somebody pretending to be a cop. The gun was to his head. I mean, this was not just embellished, this was fiction. But let's go back to the original story. I mean NBC paid billions to the Olympics, airing the interviews.SERAFIN: Right.KURTZ: And Lochte makes these charges. We saw the reporter say and this was a very brave thing for him to do to defy the gunmen. Should the press have fallen for this? I mean, this always seems like the story -- always seemed to me something wrong with the story but I didn't think he was making it up. Should the press have been less gullible here?SERAFIN: Well, I think it played into that. As Matt Lauer said, it played into that whole narrative of the mean streets of Rio. And I think, so people were quick to accept it because of that, plus you know, it has that aspect of the Olympics, the salacious, the kind tabloidy aspect that we didn't really get. There's the Gabby Douglas issue that came up that people were talking about, but then you had ratings were down with the Olympics.The seats were empty in the Olympics so, this kind of fit into another kind of way to talk about something when maybe some of the events weren't getting the kind of buzz. So, I don't think it made sense that the press accepted it because the way that Billy Bush kind of grabbed him, saw him in the store and then grabbed him to the (inaudible).KURTZ: Right. Well, I do think NBC did a good job having been fed the initial lie. It is a lie.SERAFIN: Which Al Roker said many times -- it was a lie, it was a lie.KURTZ: In aggressively covering the aftermath and trying to hold Lochte accountable. Kim, we'll see you a bit later in the show. Up next, Hillary Clinton fighting conservative media reports about her health that her campaign says are wild rumors. And later, so many Hollywood celebs out here smacking Donald Trump around, should we care what they think?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Donald Trump with help from some in the conservative media including Breitbart and the Drudge Report is increasingly raising questions about Hillary Clinton's health.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Importantly, she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS and all of the many adversaries we face.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Sean Hannity focused on one image that's gotten some attention on the right.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS: ...sure, which shows Hillary Clinton apparently needing assistance to climb a flight of stairs at a campaign stop back in February, was picked up by the ""Drudge Report"" which posted this headline over the weekend detailing Hillary Clinton's history with falls and speculating that the former Secretary of State could be experiencing a serious undisclosed medical condition.RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC: But your conservative news consuming uncle who e-mails you a lot in all caps, what he thinks the most important story in the country right now is this conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton is in the mix of a secret grave health crisis.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: Joining us now from Washington, Sarah Flores, a Republican strategist who worked for Carly Fiorina's presidential campaign. In Louisville, Krystal Ball, commentator and senior fellow at the New Leaders Council, and here in L.A., Christina Bellantoni, assistant managing editor for politics at ""Los Angeles Times.""Sarah, that photo we just saw of Hillary Clinton being helped up the stairs that was taken in February after she had stumbled so people were helping her. Whether it's Drudge or Breitbart or Hannity, does it make sense for some conservatives in the media to be pushing this Hillary health issue?SARAH FLORES, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: I mean it's a great click bait issue that I think it's probably driving a lot of traffic on their websites, but if anyone's actually been on the trail in Iowa or New Hampshire in January or February, I need help going up the stairs. It is icy, you are in heels, you are not prepared for what's going on there unless it is like the most salted road ever. So, I think it's a little bit of a distraction, but I don't doubt its driving traffic.KURTZ: I missed the crucial high heels aspect of it. So glad you pointed that out. Crystal, perhaps there are lingering suspicions about Hillary Clinton after that fainting incident where she suffered a concussion back in 2012. What should the press do here on these health-related questions?KRYSTAL BALL, NEW LEADERS COUNCIL SENIOR FELLOW: I think it's absolutely irresponsible for outlets to be pushing this when there's absolutely no proof that there's any issue here. She's actually released more documentation on her medical status than Donald Trump has. The pictures are taken out of context, as you pointed out. There's also another video that's going around that's also been taken out of context.There's just no there there (ph) and you know, Howard, I'm no Hillary Clinton lover, I will support her in this election. I think there are legitimate issues to be pushing her on including the Clinton Foundation stuff, but this just doesn't make any sense. There's nothing to it and I think it's disgusting that outlets would mislead their viewers in implying that there's anything really going on here.KURTZ: Well, I think both candidates should release their medical records and hopefully that will be happening. You mentioned this video, so let me come to you, Christina Bellantoni, with this one. This is a two-month-old video, Hillary Clinton is being questioned by reporters and they were attempting to question her in Washington. Conservative site, ""Gateway Pundit"" headline, ""Wow! Did Hillary Clinton Just Suffer a Seizure on Camera?"" Let's take a look at the video here.(VIDEO PLAYING)KURTZ: They're shouting questions at her. Okay. Now, the A.P.'s Lisa Lerer who is one of the reporters there, Christina, wrote a piece about this and said that clearly Clinton was making an exaggerated motion with her head shaking her head vigorously as kind of like, chic (ph) and that she was laughing and she wasn't scared as some people were saying. What do you think about that piece of video?CHRISTINA BELLANTONI, LOS ANGELES TIMES: I think -- it's dangerous to diagnose anyone from a photograph or a piece of video, or even really what they are saying, right? I am pregnant, four months into it I hadn't told anybody, you know, you really don't know what's going on.KURTZ: Is this breaking news?BELLANTONI: No, but you know, this is where -- it's just dangerous. Yes, medical records are helpful, but particularly when you have a female candidate, these issues are not what we should be talking about, right? We should be talking about what each of these candidates would do for the country because you never know whether somebody is mentally capable or physically capable really until they're out there doing the job.KURTZ: Right. A lot of these TV doctors, Dr. Drew, you know, giving their opinions. They've never analyzed, I mean, they've never examined her. It's all done from afar. All right, you say we should be talking about other issues so, let's talk about the Clinton Foundation, which now announced that if indeed Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, the foundation, the family foundation, will no longer accept corporate contributions or contributions from foreign donors, which makes up about half of it.So, Sarah, that raises the obvious question, well, that's the standard now, what about when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State?FLORES: It's incredible. Reporters enjoy talking about Donald Trump because it's easy. It's, you know, a sugar high, but this is where the meat is and you have to dig into it a little. Absolutely why in the world would it not be okay for them to take foreign donations when she's president, but it was okay when she was secretary of state? And no one's been able to answer that.At the same time you'll note that the Clinton global health initiative, which is part of the Clinton Foundation, actually hasn't agreed to this. So, yes, this one part of their foundation that said they won't take foreign donations, but another huge part actually won't commit to that.So, it's a bundle of mess for Hillary Clinton and they are just enjoying the fact that the media for the most part is still concentrating on Paul Manafort's resignation and Kellyanne Conway, Steve Bannon and these very easy stories instead of digging into the hard stuff where you got to look at the numbers.KURTZ: Right. Krystal, ""Boston Globe"" editorial, ""Shut It Down If She Wins. The uber liberal ""Huffington Post"" just says, ""Just Shut It Down."" So, not a lot of defense here for the way the Clinton Foundation is taking particularly the foreign money.BALL: I mean, I think it's very hard given the fact that the Clinton Foundation was built up around Bill and Hillary and Chelsea and their global prestige, and that was really what made this foundation work. I think it's very hard if when she becomes president to really effectively put up the wall that they would need to so I agree with that assessment. And look, you know...KURTZ: All right.BALL: To what Sarah is saying here, I think that there has been a lot of digging into the meat of this issue. Unfortunately, we have public records here so that we can have some transparency. With Donald Trump on the other hand, he has no record of public service and we have very little insight into his business dealings since he won't release his tax returns. So it's very hard to know what's going on with him.KURTZ: Let me jump in because we're short on time. I don't mean to cut you off. We're short on time. So, quick one for you, Christina, the Washington Post headline underscoring the point you made a week ago, ""A Turbulent Week for Trump Overshadows Clinton's Vulnerabilities.""BELLANTONI: You know, she has really been under the radar this entire campaign, right? The campaign is about him and her reactions to him. It allows her to go out and campaign in swing states and do things that people aren't necessarily paying attention to, but the foundation issue raises a lot of really legitimate questions about what would Bill Clinton's role in a Clinton White House would be?Those are questions we all should be asking, and you know, who knows. I mean, they could completely shut the foundation down if she is elected, we don't know that, but looking into the records is important.KURTZ: I'm still stunned by the one you just uttered. The Democratic presidential nominee is under the radar because of Donald Trump.All right, coming up, The Wall Street Journal editorial page slams Donald Trump. Why is so much of the conservative media against this guy? And later, with Larry Wilmore now gone, how did ""Comedy Central"" screw up its late-night franchise?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: The Wall Street Journal editorial page, a conservative bible to many on the right ratcheted up its criticism of Donald Trump this week saying of Republicans, ""If they can't get Mr. Trump to change his act by Labor Day, the GOP will have no choice but to write off the nominee as hopeless and focus on salvaging the Senate and House and other down-ballot races.As for Mr. Trump, he needs to stop blaming everyone else and decide if he wants to behave like someone who wants to be President -- or turn the nomination over to Mike Pence."" Sarah, that was written before the shakeup, but what explains The Wall Street Journal not just opposing Donald Trump but actually suggesting he might have to drop out of this race?FLORES: Well, if you look at the polls right now, it is the case that a lot of our down-ballot senate candidates are over performing where Trump is in their states, Toomey, Ayotte, Portman, these are all swing states for Trump and he's underperforming the senate candidates. That being said, it's also the case of Donald Trump has not really cared that he's not winning over the conservative vote.The Republican vote is the same level that Hillary Clinton is winning the Democrat vote. We'll see if the shakeup makes a difference. I think Kellyanne Conway will put emphasis on winning over those harder to reach Republicans that Donald Trump has alienated, but you know, yet to be seen.KURTZ: Krystal Ball, it's not just the Journal, National Review which never liked Trump writes this week that Trump blames the media for making him look nuts by reporting the things he says, which are nuts. I mean, it's really caustic and personal this criticism from the conservative press.BALL: Well, I mean, they didn't like him to start with and now he's losing and he's losing badly. He's down in every swing state. Every important battleground state across the country is going to have to put resources into places like Georgia and Arizona and Utah that no Republican should have to, and he probably is going to bring the senate down with him.So, I think it's justified for The Wall Street Journal and for other outlets to be looking at this and say, ""Hey, buddy, right now you're losing and you're losing worse than Mitt Romney was ever down in the polls.""KURTZ: Yeah, but to suggest that he's not going to be on the ballot in November is just fantasy land. All right, so I'm constantly sort of struck by how some reporters, not commentators, not bloviators, people who are reporters, the ways in which they describe Donald Trump. Take a look at this soundbite from Politico reporter Eli Stokols.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ELI STOKOLS, POLITICO REPORTER: Why is the information flow on Donald Trump so negative? Well, it's because the press -- the country has never really seen somebody so mendacious and so...CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC: What's that mean?STOKOLS: Telling lies.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Christina, so mendacious and so willing to tell lies. If you were still the editor Roll Call, would you allow your reporters to talk about the nominee like that?BELLANTONI: This is a difficult position because our point is to trick squad (ph), right, as journalists, and you should be able to say someone said something that is not true and that is something that media is often criticized for. You know, you allow someone to say something and then you don't counter attack it.So, it's something that really reporters should be doing to all candidates. Hillary Clinton says things that are not 100 percent factual. Donald Trump says things that are not 100 percent factual...BALL: OK, but 70 percent of his statements have been rated false. So that is a very different level than any other politician we've seen. He just makes stuff up. It's not normal run of the mill exaggeration, but I think it's an inaccurate statement.BELLANTONI: Rated false by journalism institutions. Exactly.KURTZ: Well, but you know, I'm fine with saying candidates said this, it's not true, it's a lie, that's fine. When you use words like mendacious, you are signaling you do not like the guy, Christina, and I'm wondering you're out here in California, do you think New York and D.C. pundits who think that Trump is going to lose are just sort of over the line sometimes?BELLANTONI: It's not just New York and D.C., right. The idea that there's an entire segment of America, at least 39 percent in some cases, you know, 45 percent that really likes Donald Trump.KURTZ: Yes.BELLANTONI: And you can't forget that. You have to recognize that you are writing for everyone and not necessarily one specific audience.KURTZ: Journalists obviously forgot that during the primaries when they all thought Donald Trump would lose. All right, Christina Bellantoni here in L.A., Krystal Ball in Louisville and Sarah Flores back in D.C, thanks very much.After the break, why are so many celebrities here in L.A. savaging Trump, and does it matter? Plus, Comedy Central struggling in late nights, dropping Larry Wilmore, what's behind this debacle?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Comedy Central had a powerhouse late night lineup for years -- John Stewart and Stephen Colbert. Well, the L.A. show replaced with Trevor Noah is drawing little attention, his daily show down about 40 percent in the ratings. Larry Wilmore's nightly show was drawing less than half of Colbert's ratings, and this week, the network pulled the plug.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LARRY WILMORE, ""THE NIGHTLY SHOW"" HOST: I'm Larry Wilmore your next host for the next well, 29:31.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: And Kim Serafin is back with us. Can we now just come out and say that Comedy Central picking Larry Wilmore and Trevor Noah to replace Colbert and Steward was -- what's the right word, a failure?SERAFIN: Well, clearly it is very hard to replace John Stewart, and how do you replace John Stewart? And Stephen Colbert? I mean, such a high bar he set you know, again, whether you like him from the left or the right or you don't like him, the fact is he had good ratings and when...KURTZ: But forget about the ratings. One of the reasons I think it's not working is that either of these guys, they're not talked about, they're not quoted, their clips don't get much traction online. It just seems like they're not part of the conversation.So, Wilmore after he got the bad news told Fast Company that, ""race, not the easiest subject to make jokes about. I mad commentary about them. We tried our best. But if you're going to do a lot of jokes that are racially tinged, you got to find ways to be funny.SERAFIN: Right, and it was so much was about race and that's really what his show is about. And I think, you know, for John Stewart for example, even if you were on the right and you didn't like some of the criticism he had towards the right, he did kind of take aim at some other people as well.KURTZ: Occasionally.SERAFIN: Occasionally, he did -- he did that famous thing when he went after CNN about their coverage of the plane for example. So he didn't just go after the right. You could find something you liked about John Stewart. Even Bill O'Reilly would appear with Stewart.KURTZ: Right. Wilmore had that incident at the White House Correspondent's Dinner right.SERAFIN: Exactly. So I think, you know, when you hit for now...KURTZ: When he used the ""N"" word...SERAFIN: Right.KURTZ: And that didn't go over well and that didn't even make him any more famous.SERAFIN: No, and you're looking nowadays, you need to have that viral moment to do late night TV. That's what Jimmy Fallon does, that's what Jimmy Kimmel does -- he never really had any of it. The only thing that went viral kind of was that moment at the Correspondent's Dinner and that did not gain him an audience.KURTZ: I understand some people think he was an important voice, but it's all box office in this business, now...SERAFIN: Ratings were low, and he did not have an either viral...KURTZ: Sinc we're out here in the outskirts of Hollywood, so many celebrities have really denounced Trump. You know, very few are on his side. This is the latest, Robert de Niro said Trump is totally nuts. Martin Sheen, who played the president on TV, right, called him scary and an empty-headed moron. Why should anyone care what these celebrities think?SERAFIN: This happens every year that there's a presidential election. The celebrities come out. They usually support the Democratic candidate but it's not really...KURTZ: Usually as in always?SERAFIN: Always, so it's not really a surprise but...KURTZ: But it's so personal. I mean, not just he's not qualified, you know, you're using words like moron and nuts.SERAFIN: It is personal except, you know, celebrities don't really matter in terms of vote. I don't think if somebody hears a celebrity say this they're going to change their vote. I think celebrities matter in getting attention for a candidate. The matter is fund raising.Hillary is out there this week, she has always fund raisers with celebrities this week. That's where celebrities really come into play, and Trump himself is such a celebrity, he doesn't need a celebrity to give him attention.KURTZ: Right.SERAFIN: He gets that attention on his own.KURTZ: Right. Just briefly, I sometimes wondered, don't the celebrities hurt their own careers because they are alienating potentially half the audience who may like the Republican candidate and whatever the race is?SERAFIN: Except you say this every year. If people say this, and then still if you like the movie, you're going to still go see the movie. So, people may hold a grudge for a little while but if you really want to see the movie, you're going to go see the movie.KURTZ: There it is, the Hollywood (inaudible) -- as long as they buy the tickets, everything is good.SERAFIN: Exactly. If they put people in seats then, you know, you're going to go see the movie.KURTZ: Kim Serafin, great to see you. Thanks very much. Still to come, Gawker is paying a price for the losing a lawsuit over that sex tape. Plus, the legacy John McLaughlin.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Issue one, NSA, c'est la vie.Issue one, let's make a deal.Issue one, Democrats debate.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: This is the end of the line for Gawker, the gossiping website whose tone range from snarky to downright mean-spirited. The site is bankrupt, founder Nick Denton has declared personal bankruptcy and Univision, which bought Gawker for $135 million after Hulk Hogan's successful lawsuit over that sex tape of the former wrestler, is shutting it down this week. Univision apparently plans to operate some of the company's other site like Deadspin and Jezebel, Gawker is history.John McLaughlin who died this week at 89 once told me why he pushed his panelists to answer his questions in a split second. He wanted them to blurt. Blurting was good. He loved blurting because it got out the truth.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MCLAUGHLIN: And your question. One-word answer. We're out of time. Who won the Democratic debate? Pat Buchanan.PAT BUCHANAN: I think it was a draw -- slightly to Obama.MCLAUGHLIN: Wrong. Come on, Pat.ELEANOR CLIFT: I think it was a draw. They both did well making Democrats agonize.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: At least Obama on parts (ph).MCLAUGHLIN: Hillary won the debate.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Issue one, I went to a taping of the McLaughlin Group for my book ""Hot Air"", and he was the maestro for framing the issues in an entertaining way, jousting with the likes of Fred Barnes, Jack Germond and Pat Buchanan, and Eleanor Clift. McLaughlin invented the modern political talk show back in 1982, the left and right combat, the heated rhetoric, the predictions, the interruptions, wrong! -- that you've seen in roughly millions of cable segments.Issue two, McLaughlin was an unlikely television star. A Jesuit priest who worked in the Nixon White House during Watergate and yet created his raucous program that also aired on PBS station. When you agreed or disagreed with his sharp tongue, he was good TV. So, in the signoff he made famous, bye-bye, John.That's it for this L.A. edition of ""MediaBuzz."" I'm Howard Kutz.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MARIA BARTIROMO, HOST: Good morning.Donald Trump reaching out to minority voters, explaining why he says he would be best fit for the White House.Good morning, everyone. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Welcome to the program.  This is ""Sunday Morning Futures"".Trump making the appeal to voters in Michigan and Virginia, but critics are questioning the locations he picked to share these messages. We'll take a look at that with our panel.But, first, an all-star lineup this morning. I'll go one-on-one with Eric Trump on his father's campaign shake-up and a lot more. Plus, Newt Gingrich with me on the White House's admission that the $400 million payment to Iran was tied to the hostages.And Green Party candidate Jill Stein will join me live. We're looking ahead right now on ""Sunday Morning Futures"".(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us.ERIC TRUMP, SON OF DONALD TRUMP: It's great being here with you.BARTIROMO: Obviously, the news of the weekend, Paul Manafort now resigning. What does this tell us about where the campaign structure is?  Is this a direct result of the team bringing in two new people to really run things?TRUMP: Yes, there's no question. And, by the way, Paul's great guy, and I think my father didn't want to be distracted by, you know, whatever things that Paul was dealing with. And, you know, Paul was amazing. And, you know, he helped us get through the primary process, he helped us get through the convention, he did a great job with the delegates, you know?And now, you know, you look at him and Kellyanne and some of the other people that were bringing in, and they're absolutely fantastic and, you know, I think they're going to be the ones that bring us, you know, all the way through November 8th and ultimately get us that the victory.But again, my father just didn't want to have that the distraction looming over the campaign and quite frankly looming over all the issues that Hillary's facing right now.BARTIROMO: Yes, and I think right off the bat, as soon as you brought in two new players, we saw a little shift. We saw your father said couple of days ago. We saw what he said in terms of saying, look, I own this, I'm taking responsibility for if I may have insulted somebody.Was that a result of the two new players that you brought in to run the campaign?TRUMP: Yes, maybe a little bit. You know, I think --BARTIROMO: Or was that from the inside his children. Did you advise him to do those?TRUMP: I think it's -- I think it's him, right? I mean, at the end alright a minute and today my father's -- my father, right? I mean, you know, let Trump be Trump. And I think that's what -- you know, that's when he does best that's who he is and, you know, that's what created this incredible movement that he started.At the same time, don't get me wrong. A lot of people are opining on this, and I think he started you know as well. And I think coming out with a great sense of humility, again the father that I've known my entire life, I think it was amazing.And as I mentioned, I was at that speech, and the speech was amazing. It was electric and the room was electric and, you know, I was -- I was proud of him for doing that.BARTIROMO: Well, clearly, coming out of the convention which was very successful for you, the convention, something happened and obviously, Paul Manafort wasn't doing it. I mean, he wasn't doing the job because the campaign lost crowd after the convention.So, does this change now give more clarity? You've got to new players.  Does it give that freshness that you need with these just 80 days left?TRUMP: Yes, possibly. And I wouldn't even say, we came out of the convention, we had an amazing convention. We had a massive bump. In fact, one of the biggest bumps coming out of convention that you can imagine, right?And, you know, obviously, they had the convention right after, and traditionally, they'll get a bump too, right? And so, it's really interesting. I think right now, you're really seeing in the latest polls, you're really seeing that totally level out and it's really back to parity.And, you know, Hilary spent $200 million in advertising against us. We've spent nothing against her yet, yet our numbers that are at parity, and I think that's a -- that's probably pretty frustrating for them. Believe me, they don't -- they don't like the fact that we have a great war chest, you know, saved up and they spent all this money and yet, we're, you know, dead even in the polls. They're not thrilled about that.BARTIROMO: We're looking at the polls tighten in a big way. I mean, obviously, what your father's doing is working. Now, your father made a decision to go to Louisiana in the face of this terrible flooding that we're seeing there, to speak to the people, to just express his condolences and hurt with them.Why? Why is she doing this now?TRUMP: Yes. Well, you have coffins floating down the street. You have houses that are underwater. You have cars that are underwater. You have people who are -- have lost their lives, you know? And the president of the United States is in Martha's Vineyard playing golf. You know, he can't be bothered to hop on Air Force One, one of the nicest planes in the world, to fly down there for half a day to check in on the situation.He's sitting there playing you know is 200th round of golf this year.You know, at the same time, Hillary is sitting there you know resting. I mean, these are our leaders -- it is shocking. These are the people that we have elected as a country to lead.And I think my father was just frustrated by it, you know? And so, he went down there to show his support, with Mike Pence, he's on the ground and, you know, I'm not proud of him for doing that.But I just say -- I'm disgusted by the fact that the commander-in-chief of the United States couldn't be bothered to hop on Air Force One to fly down there for a couple hours to find out what was going on. It's a -- it's truly, truly sad.BARTIROMO: We now know that the White House has admitted that this $400 million that went to Iran was in fact contingent upon them releasing the American hostages. What does your father plan in terms of the Iran deal?  How easy would it be to reverse? And your thoughts on this hostage payment that we now know was, in fact, ransom?TRUMP: Maria, I actually think that Iran deal was one of the things that - - it was almost in the auspices of getting my father to run for president.  I remember you know when I was first talked about years ago and he was shaking his head. He -- we can't be serious, so we can't honestly consider giving a hundred fifty billion dollars to a country that hates our guts, that hates our way of life, that detest everything about Western civilization.We can't -- we can't be serious about doing that, and they ended up doing it. And then, you see obviously the four prisoners were contingent on the, you know, the $400 million. And you're sitting there, as a guy who travels overseas -- I mean, they put a target on every American's head that leaves, you know, the boundaries of this country, including, quite frankly, every military personnel that we have overseas, because surely our government is now paying, you know, for hostages. You simply can't do it.I mean, $150 billion dollars was atrocious, $400 million dollars in cash being dropped off in the middle of the night is just as bad. I mean, it's -- you almost can't make this up. I mean you really almost can't make this up.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean we don't even know the terms because we learned about it after it was already done. So, again, the president went around Congress.What can we expect --TRUMP: By the way, he lied about it.BARTIROMO: Yes.TRUMP: He lied about it. He said that that it wasn't -- it wasn't ransom money, the $400 million had nothing to do with the hostages. No different than he lied about Obamacare where he said, you'd get to keep your doctor.  You get to keep your plan.No different than Hillary Clinton lies about the 33,000 emails, no different than Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, right? I mean, no different than Hillary Clinton lies about every scandal that they had in the White House.I mean, this is what you're getting from our politicians in this country, where America were better than that. You know, we need to have people who are actually honest with the citizens of this nation and represent them well and that's simply not happening.BARTIROMO: Which is why he reached out to this and the Hispanic community this weekend, reached out to the American -- the African-American community earlier last week.What should we expect in terms of these groups? Is he going to be able to really move the needle in terms of Hispanics, African-Americans, women, another group that he really needs to get those numbers up in terms of the vote?TRUMP: Yes, well, I hope so. You know, it's interesting as a non- politician stepping in and see how ingrained politics are in certain people that they can just never -- they never take off the blinders and look outside that, you know, their party -- the party that they've always voted for before.But again, if you look at what Democrats have done, you know, for inner cities -- for inner-city youth, again, sixty percent unemployment. I mean, they've never done anything. They always promise great things and then nothing ever happens.If you look at Chicago, right, you have 2,500 shootings this year alone in Obama's home city, if you look at Detroit, if you look at Baltimore, if you look at so many of these places, they've been run by Democrats for the last 50, 60, 70 years and look what happens. They never get better. They just never get better.And I think part of my father's message last night is, why not try something new? Why not give me a chance? Let me bring you back jobs to this country. Let me fix an educational system that's a total disaster, that's full of fraud and waste and abuse and nonsense. Lt me fix these problems, it's something I can do, what you have to lose?And that's what he said last night, what do you have to lose? It's broken, I will fix it. You know, give me the chance to fix it.BARTIROMO: Eric, it's nice to have you on the program.TRUMP: Yes, thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. We'll be watching, Eric Trump.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: All right. My thanks to Eric Trump. We conducted that interview Friday afternoon.And since the interview, the White House has announced, President Obama now will visit Louisiana. He's going to this Tuesday. The state's Governor John Bel Edwards making it clear that he said he requested the president wait a week after the rain fell to allow emergency responders to do their work and for the cleanup to get underway. So, we will be bringing you more once the President does go to Louisiana on Tuesday.Big changes coming to the Clinton Foundation, meanwhile, regardless of whether Hillary Clinton moves into the White House. Is it enough to stem the wave of criticism about the Foundation's donations policy? Who gives them money? We will delve into that with Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn live next.You can follow me on Twitter @mariabartiromo, @sundayfutures. Let us know what you'd like to hear from Congressman Blackburn. We're looking ahead right now on ""Sunday Morning Futures"".(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.A major makeover in the works for the Clinton Foundation. Hillary Clinton's family charity will put an end to foreign donations, they said, should she be elected president.Now, former President Bill Clinton also saying he will resign from the board, in an effort to avoid potential distractions or second-guessing.Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn joins us right now live, who has been leading the investigation or pushing for this investigation of the foundation.Congresswoman, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN, R-TENN.: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Is this enough, do you think, these changes that they are talking about, should Hillary Clinton be elected?BLACKBURN: Maria, these are things that should have taken place when she became secretary of state. The former president should have removed himself from the board. They should have had outside oversight and guidance on that board, and they should have changed the way they were working and stop taking some of these foreign contributions that they had been taking.BARTIROMO: So where is the investigation around the Clinton Foundation right now, Congresswoman, because there's really conflicting reports in terms of whether or not this is in the eye of regulators right now?BLACKBURN: Well, we have our letter. As you know, May 19th, 2015 was the first letter that we sent over to the IRS with the non-response. We have followed that subsequently with letters to the FTC which oversees nonprofits, and then the letter currently that we have before the IRS, the FTC, and the FBI together.We have received a referral to the nonprofit's division of the IRS. We think this is important.And, Maria, we think one of the things that is most significant in this, we know the Clinton Foundation went from 1998 to 2007, and did not report the foreign contributions that they were receiving. They never reported that to the IRS.And so, we do think there is a reason to move forward with the examination there, via the FTC. There is a reason to question there because they're giving only thirteen percent of what they bring in to their stated mission which, of course, was never altered from when it was the library.And, you know, Maria, there it charity should be giving more than half of what they bring in. So, there's reason for that review there and then, of course, the FBI, we think they should look at some of these issues around Frank Giustra, Uranium One, Laureate Education, the list goes on and on, the Nigerian land deal.BARTIROMO: Yes, you mentioned a number of the really more onerous situations and very straightforward. So, the Uranium One deal, for example, Hillary Clinton State Department sold twenty five percent of the U.S.'s uranium to Russia and we should point out that uranium is the stuff that makes nuclear bombs.BLACKBURN: Nuclear. Right.BARTIROMO: And then very soon after, the company, Uranium One, donated to the Clinton Foundation, and Bill Clinton got money for a speech in Moscow.BLACKBURN: That -- that is right, and see when you look at the timeline and the way you always have the participation of Hillary, of Bill, the foundation and the outside entity. That circuitous relationship I should call every -- cause every one concern and it is something that the American people deserve some answers to.And, you know, now, we know that there were emails that were written by staffers from the State Department requesting appointments or interviews for individuals who had contributed to the foundation. They're saying -- they're finally going to do the right thing if she is elected president.  But this is something that I think they're too far down the road for this to even begin to make a difference in the mind of the voter.BARTIROMO: But I mean in the mind of the voter, is this going to sway them come November 8th? What if we don't get any details in terms of the investigation and what lawmakers find out any more than we know of course by the election?BLACKBURN: You know, Maria I think it adds -- it's that compound effect.  People remember the scandals that have always been kind of following along with Bill and Hillary Clinton, and they go back decades. And people know that, and now, they look at once he left the presidency how they operated this foundation.They never refile their mission to do a global initiative. I think that's why they're going to close it down after this year. They never filed the 990s for foreign contributions and only after she became secretary of state did they alter that process.BARTIROMO: Yes.BLACKBURN: It is that web of deception, deceit, of always playing with a different set of rules. And if you or I had done this, we would be in jail.BARTIROMO: Yes. All right. We'll keep checking back with you, Congresswoman, see what you find out. Thanks so much for joining us.BLACKBURN: Sure. Thank you.BARTIROMO: We appreciate it very much. Marsha Blackburn there.The Obama administration admitting now that it did delay a $400 million payment to Iran as leverage for four American prisoners. Was it a ransom?  Well, it certainly looks like it. Newt Gingrich will join us next on that.And then Donald Trump's so-called pivot as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures"".Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: The Obama administration admitting the $400 million that it paid to Iran was in fact done in agreement with the release of four Americans held in the country. Donald Trump claiming President Obama lied about this not being a ransom payment. Newt Gingrich is a former speaker of the house and Fox News contributor.Mr. Speaker, always pleasure. Thanks so much for joining us.NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to do with you.BARTIROMO: Well, if it looks like ransom, and it smells like ransom, I guess this was a ransom payment.GINGRICH: You know, I'm always surprised that people are surprised that Obama lies. Obama lied about you getting to keep your doctor and he lied about you get to keep your insurance. He lied consistently about this kind of government he wanted to create. Why would you -- he lied about a Syrian redline -- I mean why would you think this is any different?The reason that Hillary lies so much is if you're a modern liberal Democrat, you can tell the truth and survive. If Obama gone to the country and said, you know, we're going to pay ransom. Yes, it's a dictatorship.  Yes, they're bad people. Yes, they have been kidnapping Americans. But, hey, you got to understand my problem.The country would have repudiated him overwhelmingly and they count on us just tolerating and shrugging off a routine pattern of lying, while they do things that are really bad. I mean paying $400 million and give -- think about how humiliating this is. We -- because you can't legally use U.S. dollars because Congress passed a law blocking it, they transmitted by the way also illegal to do what they did, which is take dollars, turn them into euros and Swiss francs, bundle them up into -- these bundles are absurdity.  It looks like it's a it's a movie like ""Lethal Weapons Nine"" or something.BARTIROMO: It's like a mafia.GINGRICH: Yes. And so, the United States humiliate itself, flying cash into Iran at the same time that they released for people, which is a total victory for the dictatorship and for terrorists.BARTIROMO: What would you expect from Hillary Clinton as it relates to Iran? And Donald Trump has said he would get in there and repeal cancel out this nuclear deal with the Iranians. How easy or tough would that be, Newt?I mean, it's not the kind of situation you can just reverse, right, even as they chant death to America?GINGRICH: Look, the Iranians routinely break the agreements. Every time, they fire a missile, they are breaking the agreement which block them from testing. As a relatively intelligent lawyer could find plenty of evidence in the last few months that they have broken the agreement so often, that we can -- we can we can initiate and just dropping and say, we're not going to do it. And then, what are they going to do?You know, what you have here is a phony legalism in which the American subject themselves to the rule of law, while the dictatorship exploits every loophole that can in violation of the rule of law. I think Trump would turn that around.But Hilary will -- Hillary will be Barack Obama with corruption. I mean, surely as radical as he is, she'll be as driven to do things by executive orders he is. But she'll add a layer of corruption unlike Obama -- there's no evidence that Obama personally is particularly corrupt. She and Bill are so corrupt. They will be the most corrupt couple ever to move into the White House if they win.BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, we seem to be watching this pivot happening with Donald Trump. We've been talking about this, this morning. Is this a new pivot, Newt?What's going on right now with his campaign and is he doubling down on, you know, humility, he apologized and he regrets things. Is he going to reach out, for example, to others, who perhaps he may have insulted and what does this mean for his campaign?GINGRICH: Well, I think there are two characteristics about Trump that are a little contradictory. On the one hand, he's very stubborn, which is a characteristic of very successful people. On the other hand, he's very, very smart.So, after a while, the amount he learns overwhelms his stubbornness and I think that's what happened here. He figured out that going into a general election was very different from winning the primaries. That really took him five or six weeks, because he'd had done so well in the primaries, I think he didn't want to give up the techniques that were working, but gradually came to realize that wasn't working anymore.He's brought on two really strong people. I mean, Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway are remarkable talents. And I noticed, all this last week, every single speech starting on Monday with radical Islam and coming all the way up, there was a tonal quality there's even more important in the words. He was reassuring people that he was in control of himself, that he was talking in a reasonable way.He's a very -- as Ronald Reagan taught us, you can say very strong things, if you say in a very calm tone.BARTIROMO: Do you think then this could resonate with some of those never Trumpers? Will this pivot resonate with some of the Republicans that have been unwilling to get on board?GINGRICH: Yes, I think there are three groups there the skeptics are going to come on board pretty fast just because he's getting to be so controlled and so reassuring and his ideas are so compelling. They're going to come on fast.There are the sort of personal never Trumpers who eventually I think it over particularly as they watch Hillary, and they're going to end up with him.And then there are people, as I said a moment ago, you know, if you're a real foreign policy, you know, let's go over there and force democracy everywhere and send another million American troops and do the things we need to do and to heck with the cost, you shouldn't be for Trump. I mean, Trump's not gonna do anything you want him to do. You should be for Hillary, because she's going to be much more likely to get us in the next war than Donald Trump is.BARTIROMO: Yes. Mr. Speaker, good to speak with you. Thanks so much.GINGRICH: Good to be with you. Thanks.BARTIROMO: We appreciate it. Newt Gingrich there.Meanwhile, Donald Trump finally airing his first television ads of the general election season, hammering the system as rigged. Will his claim help them regain the footing in the polls?Eric Shawn dives into the issue of voter fraud. We're looking ahead and we'll take a look at that next, on ""Sunday Morning Futures"".Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.New information this morning that Governor McAuliffe of Virginia tomorrow will announce that he has restored voting rights for 13,000 felons on a case-by-case basis and he will be announcing that tomorrow.Donald Trump is also laying the groundwork for claims of voter fraud. A brand-new television airing in several swing states says that the system is rigged. The Trump campaign is spending $5 million to run the commercials, trying to fire up Republicans in states where early voting gets underway in a few weeks, like North Carolina, for example, court struck down a voter ID law the judges said targeted African-Americans.Our Fox News senior correspondent Eric Shawn digs deeper into these concerns.So, you don't need an ID to vote?ERIC SHAWN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Well, it depends upon what state you're in, if it's a photo ID or not, if you have an affidavit. You know, Maria, for years, I've covered investigated voter and election fraud cases here at Fox News, and you won't believe what we found.Take a look at this. These are absentee ballots that were fake.  Prosecutors in Troy, New York, said politicians simply stole elections by handing in fraudulent ballots that they filled out as real votes. The unsuspecting voters we talked to said they did not even know their votes were robbed.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)SHAWN: So, you didn't write that.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I did not.SHAWN: You didn't cast a lot.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I did not.SHAWN: Did you vote?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No.SHAWN: Did you fill out an absentee ballot?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nope.SHAWN: Did you fill out an absentee ballot application?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, no filling it.SHAWN: So, your vote was a fraud.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was.SHAWN: A Kentucky prosecutor said 20 public officials stole elections by buying votes, spending four hundred thousand dollars to buy 8,000 votes over several elections.You sold your vote. How much did you sell you vote for?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Twenty-five dollarsSHAWN: Well, in Cincinnati, veteran poll worker Melowese Richardson was charged voting in the 2008 and 2012 presidential election not once, but two and three times. She pled no contest of four counts, including voting for her sister who had been in a coma for a decade.In Pennsylvania, seven election officials have been hit with election fraud charges deaths in the last year and a half, from cases of illegal voting to tampering with voting machines and adding phony votes. You know, a 2012 report by a Philadelphia Republican city commissioner found voting by non- registered individuals, voting divisions with more votes than voters, individuals voting more than once, and voting by non-U.S. citizens.And election fraud actually hit the race for the White House in the 2008 race. Democratic operatives in Indiana were convicted of faking signatures on the presidential petitions that put then-Senator Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on the ballot.So many signatures were phony that authorities said the president may not have actually had enough signatures to qualify for the primary ballot.Is that your signature on this?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's not my signature.SHAWN: Did you sign this petition for Barack Obama?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, no.SHAWN: You did not?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I did not sign for Barack Obama.SHAWN: Someone forged this?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's correct.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHAWN: So, this is how it works in Indiana, it is unbelievable. You need 500 signatures from each congressional district in Indiana. In South Bend, President Obama qualified with 534 signatures. The prosecutor said 100 to 200 signatures were fake, so that brings the Obama number down below the legal number that he needed to qualify.The prosecutor told me he had this been caught at the time, Maria, the president probably would not have qualified for the ballot would have been bounced from that primary ballot. But all this fraud wasn't caught until three years after the election.BARTIROMO: This is unbelievable, Eric. You've done such good work on this.We want to bring in -- so congratulations. Thank you.John Fund is with us. He's columnist for ""National Review Magazine"".John, thank you very much for joining us, and you two have done so much work on this.First off, the Terry McAuliffe situation in Virginia tomorrow, what's your sense? Would that classify as potentially raising a red flag for potential voter fraud?JOHN FUND, NATIONAL REVIEW COLUMNIST: Well, felons aren't allowed to vote until they get their rights restored. They've proven themselves to be part of the mainstream of society. What Terry McAuliffe is doing is not in the case by case basis. He's trying to put every felon back on the voter rolls, including 232 serious sex offenders.So, there was no distinction made between what kind of crime you committed and the kind of people Terry McAuliffe wanted to give back the voting rights to.BARTIROMO: So that could basically come on under review in terms of whether or not this is voting fraud.FUND: The Supreme Power is already slapped him down and said he can't do it for all 200,000. So, now, he's trying to do it first small segment of that group.BARTIROMO: How worried are you? What's your reaction to Eric's report?FUND: Well, we have a sloppy inefficient system, so sometimes you don't know when the sloppiness ends and the fraud begins, because the sloppiness feeds into the fraud. We make it so easy for people to vote in someone else's name.In New York City, investigators from the New York City Department investigation went out and tried to vote of the names of people who were out-of-state dead or felons. And 61 out of 63 times, they were handed ballots. One of the times, the two times they weren't is because somebody was trying to vote in the name of the son of one of the poll workers.So, the point is there's a ninety-seven percent success rate because if you don't have an ID laws, Eric said, half the states you don't, there is no way to really catch someone and once they vote, it goes in the ballots with all the other ballots, and you can never segregated out and find out where the fraud is.BARTIROMO: Eric?SHAWN: You know, what we saw in 2008, the Norm Coleman and Al Franken race, that they separated by 341 votes. It wasn't until later that studies found at least a thousand felons they believe illegally voted in that race.FUND: And 200 were convicted.SHAWN: Two hundred convicted, yes.So, yes, but that still didn't get to the 341.FUND: We found out after he was sworn in. You can't do anything.BARTIROMO: I mean, these no ID States is just it's just mind-boggling.  Who's to stop anybody from voting four times?FUND: Here's my point I don't think they're very many people who don't have an ID, but if there are, let's get them one, because you can't participate in the mainstream of American life. You can't get a job, you can't get a government benefit, you can't get on Medicare, you can't travel, you can catch a check.But these groups that are fighting the voter ID laws, if they spent all those legal fees on actually getting people IDs, we wouldn't have this debate.BARTIROMO: Are we going to see any efforts to stop this, to make sure that we actually see a system that is fair?SHAWN: Well, the election officials that I've talked to they say that they are confident that any fraud will be caught. They point of these cases, for example, as evidence of that, and in Rhode Island and New Hampshire, the Secretary of State's there say the way to do it is to have an ID with an affidavit. If you don't have the photo ID, you fill out an affidavit, your vote then has a paper trail to be challenged later, if there's any type of --FUND: Those secretaries of state are Democrats, by the way. They are and they want their honest anti-fraud Democrats.I think the real issue here is that we have to get groups, outside groups not necessarily filled with campaigns, they're nonpartisan groups like truethevote.org out of Texas, which is a national organization. If they -- if you watch people, if you tap people who pressure prosecutors to pay attention to this as a priority, you can reduce voter fraud.It's like shoplifting. If you do three things in shoplifting, you reduce shoplifting 40 percent. Put up a camera even if you don't turn it on.  Have a security guard, even if he's asleep. And put up a sign that says prosecutions will take place.BARTIROMO: Yes.FUND: You cut shoplifting by 40 percent. It's the same thing with voter fraud.BARTIROMO: There's also a whole idea, if the IRS is going to target conservatives, right, I mean that's another part of this, because people say you're quieting down an enormous group by targeting them and making them unable to participate.FUND: But there's no evidence in all of these court cases including the ones you mentioned there was no evidence of anyone has ever been prevented from actually voting. No names were put forward. The issue here is we have to civil rights -- the civil right to of course vote not to be intimidated. That's why we're Voting Rights Act.BARTIROMO: Right.FUND: But we also have a civil right not to have your old canceled out by someone who shouldn't be voting, someone who's dead, someone was a felon.  If you get your vote cancel out, it's as if you didn't vote.BARTIROMO: Right. Well, I know, Eric, you're going to be doing more work on this. It's an important subject. Thank you so much.SHAWN: Yes, we will be on it. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Eric Shawn, John Fund, good to see you, sir. Thank you.Let's get a look at what's coming up top of the hour, ""Media Buzz"". Here's Howie Kurtz in Los Angeles today.Hi, Howie.HOWARD KURTZ, ""MEDIA BUZZ"" HOST: An early good morning from California, Maria.We're going to be all over the coverage of the Trump campaign shake-up.  The hiring of the chairman of Breitbart, the conservative website, the impact and the media skepticism about whether he really is regretting as he said in a speech from this past comments.We'll look at new questions about the Clinton Foundation. And this bizarre Ryan Lochte story, the bogus burglary story, another non-apology with Matt Lauer yesterday. We'll take a look at that as well.BARTIROMO: Yes, that really is a bizarre story.Howie, we will see in about 20 minutes. Thank you so much.We're just about one month away from the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. But there are two other candidates hoping to join that debate stage. Green Party nominee Jill Stein will join me live, next. We're looking ahead right now on ""Sunday Morning Futures"".(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Nearly all of the attention this election cycle has been focused on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. But there are a few other candidates in the race. Green Party candidate Jill Stein is one of them. To qualify for the presidential debate however, a candidate must pull at 15 percent at least.The latest Real Clear Politics average of polling shows Mrs. Clinton leading Donald Trump by five and a half percent, libertarian candidate Gary Johnson trails with about eight and a half percent, and Green Party nominee Jill Stein garners just three percent. She joins me right now.Jill Stein, Green Party presidential nominee.Good to see you, Jill. Thanks so much for joining us.JILL STEIN, GREEN PARTY PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Great to be with you, Maria.BARTIROMO: How are you going to break through the noise and get to that debate stage?STEIN: Mainly by letting voters know that they have other choices. Right now, the majority of voters do not like this two-party election process and Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have the highest rates of disapproval and dislike of any candidates ever in presidential elections. More people than ever are clamoring for other choices.BARTIROMO: And we know that for years ago you made a big splash at the presidential debate when it was at Hofstra University, not on stage, but you were -- because you were not permitted to participate, but outside, you protested. You were arrested for disorderly conduct when you try to enter the hall against the police officers orders.Are you going to be outside again if you don't get in?STEIN: You can be sure that I will and I won't be alone this time. I think there are a lot of Americans who feel like we not only have a right to vote, we have a right to know who we can vote for, especially in an election where people are tired of being thrown under the bus on jobs, on healthcare, on student debt, and people are clamoring for more choices.So, let's let a real debate be held and then let's let the American people decide.BARTIROMO: Let's talk to those people right now. You've got this bloc of people who are very loyal to Hillary Clinton. You got another bloc of people that are that are loyal to Donald Trump. Then you've got this enormous bloc in the middle of independent, some of them undecided right now.How are you going to resonate with them? What's your most important policy to speak to those people?STEIN: Well, we need jobs, you know? Instead of sending the jobs overseas, we need jobs and while Donald Trump may talk about stopping these a corporate trade deals, the Trans Pacific Partnership, he himself has been sending his jobs overseas.So, we need jobs here. We need to end student debt. We bailed out Wall Street. We're calling for the bailout of a generation that's basically been held hostage in unpayable debt.We need good jobs that pay decent wages. We need healthcare as a human right and we need to solve this climate crisis. For those who ever doubted it, just look at California and let's look at what's happening at Louisiana and the heat waves in the Northeast.We say solve these, at the same time, we call for a New Deal kind of program, but a green New Deal that will transition us to the energy of the future and the economy of the future.BARTIROMO: Why should people trust you leading the economy? How are you going to create jobs?STEIN: Great. So, number one, I'm the only candidate in this race that doesn't take lobbyist money, that doesn't take corporate money and that doesn't have a super PAC.I'm a physician, not a politician, and I'm in this to help heal are very sick political system so that we can fix all the other things that are literally putting our lives on the line.And, you know, how will I do this? By unleashing the power of the American people who should be the engine of our democracy, because I'm not on the payroll of the big banks or the war profiteers, I actually have the liberty to stand up for what the American people are clamoring for.And with an organizer in chief in the White House, we can actually mobilize the public support to instruct our elected representatives who should be representing us not the big money interest who may have been taking marching orders from.BARTIROMO: What industry do you think is most poised to see job creation under your leadership?STEIN: You know, I think it's especially clean renewable energy. So, it's -- it's wind, it's solar, it's conservation, it's manufacturing of all the different efficiency devices, and also it's sustainable agriculture that has become so popular in so many communities. We deserve to have a food system that's making us healthy. Right now, our industrial food system is making us sick.And this, by the way, Maria is how we pay for this. The studies show that we get so much healthier when we moved to an economy of clean energy without pollution, a healthy food system and a transportation system that also allows us to use recreation as transportation, that means safe sidewalk and bike paths.We get so much healthier that our health savings alone is enough to pay for the cost of the energy transition.BARTIROMO: That's a really good point. Jill Stein, great to see you.STEIN: Great to see, Maria.BARTIROMO: We'll be watching the developments. Thanks so much for joining us.STEIN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: All right. Dr. Jill Stein.The Trump campaign doubling down on its spending for the month of July, what did they get for their money and has it helped?Our political panel is here. We're looking ahead next on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" with our panel. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Donald Trump's campaign more than doubled its spending last month, according to the Federal filings, to more than $19 million, that despite a steady payroll buying no TV ads or spending money to build out a ground game.So where did the money go? About half went to a web design firm, more air travel and consultants. All of that as Mr. Trump says the Republican Party has to reach out more to African-American voters.I want to bring our panel right now. Ed Rollins, former campaign manager for the Reagan-Bush ticket in 1984. He is part of a Trump super PAC.  Julie Roginsky is here, Democratic strategist and Fox News contributor.  Mary Kissel is with us, a member of the editorial board of ""The Wall Street Journal"".Good to see, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.In terms of the money raised from -- they had a good July, Ed Rollins, but the way the money is spent very different than the way Hillary Clinton spending the money.ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Right. The big donors have not totally kicked in yet, and my sense is they may not at the end of the day, but he's got enough money to keep moving forward. The critical thing here, he has to build a ground game. If this comes down to three or four percent race, that where it is, and he's there now on TV. They got their first TV ad on, and I think he is much more discipline. I think this new team, Steve Bannon and Kellyanne, who I worked with in many campaigns is a quality, quality professional, and I think that this is a team, that they got to take it across the finish line and certainly, Manafort was not going to do that.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, Julie, he's had a positive reaction to this new team in place so far. It looks like he's also getting a bump in the polls.JULIE ROGINSKY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, he has, but let's see what happens next week. Every time Trump does something that's good for 24 or 48 hours, all get excited, the pivot is finally here, it's finally coming, it never comes.I will say his former campaign team and I think you'll agree with me, committed malpractice. This is money that should have been spent on a ground game. should have been spent on advertising. It should not have gone to overhead the way it has.He was gouged by his consultants. He was gouged by the people that he paid. They're not giving him good advice. He should have put this on TV, on the air, on ground.BARTIROMO: Wow.ROGINSKY: Not what they did with it, which essentially pocket the money.  It is malpractice of the highest degree. If they were lawyers, they would have been disbarred.BARTIROMO: And at the same time, Hillary Clinton has spent all of her money on just that.ROGINSKY: Exactly right.BARTIROMO: Mary, what do you think?MARY KISSEL, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: I'm not sure you can blame the consultants fully however. I mean, Donald Trump is Donald Trump, and he's made this campaign about himself. Why was there so much attention to this one word regret in his speech on Friday, it's because we're focusing on Donald Trump's feelings. We're not focusing on his policy ideas or why they're better than Hillary Clinton's.I think, look, he knew that the campaign was spiraling downwards. He's not leading in any of the polls. There's the prospect of losing the Senate.  It's a good sign that he brought in a pro like Kellyanne Conway as a pollster. But he has to prove that he not only has the temperament to be in office, but that he can sustain some of these messages that he started to lay out in these speeches last week.We'll see, but the polls don't change overnight.BARTIROMO: Can he do that?KISSEL: I don't know if he has the character to do it. He hasn't proved so far. He isn't studying any policy measures. We don't have specifics on what would replace ObamaCare, how he would defeat ISIS, the tax plan for instance.If you read the speeches, there are a lot of good themes in there. I'm glad that he supports charter schools. I'm glad that he wants to get rid of regulatory tape. I'm glad that he wants to unleash American energy.  That's very positive.BARTIROM: Yes.KISSEL: This was a very winnable campaign. I think if you had that campaign structure in place that Julie was talking about and you had a more discipline candidate he'd be ahead by 10 or 20 points at this at this time.ROLLINS: Newt Gingrich laid out a few minutes ago on your show, that the offense that they need to be on. If this campaign comes down to be about him and his controversies, he's not going to win.If it's about her and the misfires that she's done, and all misdemeanor crimes, because I don't believe in charging someone with crime, but I think at the end of the day, there's vulnerabilities there. The combination of Obama and what they have done and the paying the Iranian hostages, what- have-you. There's so much stuff there. Newt laid it out very well.BARTIROMO: Yes.ROLLINS: I think that's what they have to be.ROGINSKY: The problem though is, and this continues to be something that's a concern for him is that, Mary is absolutely right, he can't lay it out.  Gingrich may have laid it out. You certainly just laid it out. He can't focus on her. He has to constitutionally only focus on himself, and that's not what people want to hear.(CROSSTALK)ROGINSKY: It's pathological. People want to hear how he's going to improve their lives, not what he feels about himself.KISSEL: And I don't think you can just do it on Twitter and Facebook and at rallies. It was good that he went to Louisiana, but let see him go to a charter school in the Bronx. Let's see him going to downtown L.A., like have more press gaggles, get out there, meet voters, prove that you really care about these communities.I think Kellyanne Conway will try to push in that direction but ultimately, it's up to the candidates himself.ROLLINS: He likes the rallies, but the problem with rallies, it's just a small audience, whether it'd be seven thousand or ten thousand. I remind them that a hundred thousand people were Mondale's rally in New York City the day before he lost 49 states.BARTIROMO: There you go. Bottom line.Great panel. Thanks, everybody.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, the polls just closed in Nebraska and we can now say Donald Trump is the big winner in his quest to build up the delegate count.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly. Today, voters in Nebraska and West Virginia headed to the polls. Donald Trump winning big in both states. Of course he was the only major candidate on the ballot so, you know, it was kind of expected. But it was a different story over on the Democratic side. Where only West Virginia counts for them. Front- runner Hillary Clinton suffering yet another loss. To Democratic socialist Bernie Sanders.Now, you may recall West Virginia has been hit hard by coal's decline and folks there did not take kindly to Clinton's suggestion that she would put a lot of coal miners and companies out of business. But this is not the end of Mrs. Clinton's problems. New polling indicates her likely matchup with Donald Trump may be tighter than previously thought. Not only that, she has a big problem with male voters. We'll have more on that just a little later in the hour.Plus, we'll be joined by Brit Hume in moments. But we begin tonight with West Virginia's favorite son, Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News digital politics editor who is tracking the exit polling as it comes in. He is over there by the decision desk. He steps away from me. But apparently they thought it would be more exciting if we could see him with some computers behind him. So, I take you to Chris Stirewalt to tell us what we should glean -- what you believe is the headline from the races we've watched tonight.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: I'm in here as evidence, not that I am smart, but I know smart people and then I'm around them and they will tell me things. The reality tonight for Hillary Clinton is this, we could probably go ahead and make the call on the West Virginia general election vote. She'd get beat bad. And I mean really bad. Half of the Democrats said they wouldn't vote for her. Third of them said they'd vote for Trump. Those are the Democrats. Those are the people who went and voted in the Democratic primary today. What this tells us is that when it comes to White voters, and West Virginia is the perfect core sample of white working class voters in America.What it tells us is, when it comes to these voters, especially among men, it is a disaster. You made reference to those polls in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, that showed the same thing. The gender gaps here are maybe 10 points as much as ten points higher than they were the last time around with the general electorate. Mitt Romney losing women by substantial numbers. Donald Trump losing numbers by huge numbers. Hillary Clinton doing horribly with male voters. This is battle of the sexes. And also, White voters big for Trump. Minority voters as little as 14 percent. So this is tough stuff.KELLY: Don't you find that interesting, though? That she is struggling so mightily with the men and Trump continues to struggle with the women. And as somebody who watches elections, Stirewalt, how does that play out?STIREWALT: Well, here's the deal. Generally speaking, women vote at a greater frequency than men. The numbers aren't a huge difference. If you had to pick one gender, yes, it would be women. The issue here basically is this. If you -- this cannot persist. It will not persist that you can have such a wide delta. A national discussion is getting ready to take place. And it's going to take place in a lot of homes. And it's going to take place between a lot of husbands and a lot of wives about, okay, I want him, you want her, I'm right, you're wrong.And they'll going to go back and forth about that stuff. And it's going to happen on the air waves, it's going to happen around the country. I'll put it this way, if a chasm of this magnitude were to persist, this enormous chasm, if that was what was going on, you better believe that we would be in for a deeply fractured country.KELLY: Is there any reason to watch Trump continue in, you know, states like West Virginia in Nebraska tonight, Oregon coming up? Do we care what happens in those states now? We know he's got it.STIREWALT: No, I mean, we don't. Whatever Mitt Romney -- in the end, here's the amazing thing. Donald Trump had about the same share of the primary vote of both Mitt Romney and John McCain when the race ended about 40 percent.KELLY: But he got it before the race ended, you're saying?STIREWALT: Right. No, the race has ended. When after Indiana, when it was kaput and the last guy -- Ted Cruz said, I might run if we click our heels together three times and everybody in Nebraska says, I'm the guy. Maybe I'd get back in. Give me a break.(LAUGHTER)The reality is, when it was over, after Indiana, and they all dropped out, they had the same share. Donald Trump did about his -- now, he had some things going against him, particularly that nobody's ever gotten more votes against him in a Republican primary than him. But he did about as well as Romney, he did about as well as McCain. But the situation around him looks very different than it did for those two.KELLY: In what way?STIREWALT: In the fact that he's facing these chasms.KELLY: Yes, right, right. There was not this strong objection from women, from Hispanics, from young people and so on that at least exist right now. Chris, great to see you.STIREWALT: You bet.KELLY: For the Clinton campaign, tonight's results in West Virginia are a far cry from 2008, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Thank you, may God bless you and God bless America.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That's Mrs. Clinton from eight years ago delivering her victory speech after beating then Senator Barack Obama by a 41-point margin. What a different story tonight. And it may be revealing a big problem for Mrs. Clinton in her matchup against Donald Trump.Brit Hume is our Fox News senior political analyst. Brit, wow! It's incredible when you think back about that. You forget about how badly she crushed Barack Obama and could not manage to squeak out a win tonight. What does it tell you?BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it is this night, in more than one respect, is all about her weakness as a candidate, her weakness, surprising weakness, despite the odds now in her favor among Democrats. The new polling out today in those three battleground states that you mentioned earlier suggests that she is far weaker as a general election candidate in those key states than one might have imagined against Donald Trump. So, that's your story tonight.And I think it has a lot to do, Megyn, with the economy in West Virginia, that is to say the West Virginia piece of this does, because the coal industry has had a rocky history over a very long period of time. Boom and bust cycles. And now of course you have this concerted effort on the part of the Obama administration to basically put coal industry out of business. And when Hillary Clinton made that comment, you know, we're going to be putting a lot of coal companies out of business, she was speaking the truth.KELLY: And she later says, she misspoke and she didn't mean to say that?HUME: Well, she didn't -- what she said was, it was robbed of the context, in which she was promising a big job training program and other aid for displaced miners. But the problem is of course, a lot of these people who worked in the coal mines, I wrote a book about the coal industry years ago. It's not that they love the job, it's hard work, but they are wedded to their region and coal has been a way of life in those Appalachian regions for a long time. And what they all sense is the -- what's needed is to get the regulatory boot off the neck of that industry.KELLY: Uh-hm.HUME: And it's pretty clear that Hillary Clinton with fidelity to the green, her interest and so on is not about to do that. And that is why the statement is so revealing. Not because it was, you know, a falsehood but because it was true and it made it clear she's not going to change anything, she's simply going to try to apply some kind of assistance to the people in that region.KELLY: Meanwhile, Sanders continues to burn. I mean, he's not out of it yet. He continues to win. And what does that do to her campaign?HUME: Well, first of all, it's embarrassing. And it makes it difficult for her to make the turn that I know she would like to make toward mounting the attacks that I'm sure are coming on Donald Trump. Donald Trump, you know, as has been noted by many people, is kind of a target-rich environment has a lot of things that he has said and done that are quite controversial, and would be presumably offensive to segments of the electorate that she would like to appeal to. But as long as, you know, he's still nipping at her heels and beating her various places, it exposes her weakness, exposes the fact that she hasn't got the base of her party sewed up, which you need to do to win elections, and it keeps her focused on something that she'd rather not have to focus on.KELLY: So, the Republicans like to have Bernie in this race. Is there any chance the Democrats, after all the talks of the Republicans having a contested convention, is there any chance the Democrats are facing that?HUME: Well, it looks like her delegate lead because of the presence of the super delegates and their overwhelming support for her, Republicans don't really have super delegates, the Democrats have that. She's got a prohibitive lead. And it would be, you know, a bolt of lightning were that to begin to slip away from her and him to win so big everywhere that he accumulated. Remember, the Democrats, all these states, are proportional representation.KELLY: Uh-hm.HUME: So, you can win a state, you know, handily but the person you beat gets nearly as many delegates as you do.KELLY: Yes.HUME: So, it's very hard for him -- I think it's impossible for him to catch up at this point.KELLY: I got to ask you about --HUME: But he's not given up. And so, there still continues to be this race and she's not won it.KELLY: So, what we saw between Trump and Clinton yesterday was this, and over the weekend was a dust-up about the issue of women. Trump's language about women in the past. And a group supporting Hillary put out a tough add, attacking him for the words. And Hillary meantime, is saying I'm not going to respond. He's going to run his campaign. He is going to say what he wants to say about me, about women, whatever, me and Hillary Clinton. And I'm just going to run my campaign, she said. Can she possibly maintain that with him bringing up all that stuff Bill Clinton did and she allegedly did. Back in the '90s, that a lot of these young voters are hearing for the first time? Can she maintain the ""I'm not going to comment on it,"" you know, defense?HUME: Well, look at the options. If she wants to engage in it, look, she can counterattack Trump it seems to me by highlighting the things that he said about women, the number of marriages, and his braggadocios, about his sexual exploits and all the rest, she could do that if she wanted too. But she can't really defend -- she can't deny the idea that Bill Clinton was kind of a horn dog when -- and long had that reputation and was carrying on with women while he was in the White House. I mean, that's true. And, you know, he got impeached for lying about it, you know, for lying to a grand jury about it. So, I can understand why she didn't want to feed that story.KELLY: She can just see the general election debate where she tries to say something about Trump's language and he just keeps responding horn dog, horn dog.(LAUGHTER)It's going to be interesting, Bill. It's going to be interesting. Great to see you.HUME: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: Well, with Trump inching closer to being the actual GOP nominee, two of his former opponents made news today on what may happen in Cleveland. Herman Cain is next on that story.Plus, we've got new reaction tonight to a stunning poll on Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton in three of the must-win states.Also, former Facebook employees claim the site has a serious bias against conservatives and they're not blowing the whistle on what's happening behind the scenes there. Howie Kurtz joins us live on that. Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA., FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I intend to continue to do that. But look, here's a situation that were in. On the one hand, I don't want Hillary Clinton to be the President of the United States. I don't want her to win this election. On the other hand, as I said, I have well defined differences with the current -- the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party. And like millions of Republicans, you try to reconcile those two things. I intend to live up to the pledge that we made.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Well, that was Marco Rubio in his first interview since ending his campaign doing a delicate dance around the question of whether he will pull the lever for Donald Trump. But Senator Rubio isn't the only also ran sending mixed messages today. Both Rubio and Ted Cruz were out suggesting that they will continue to support their party while tiptoeing around the specific questions of whether that means they will actually vote for Donald Trump. And Cruz added an even deeper wrinkle in an interview with Glenn Beck, suggesting he may be leaving the door open to getting back into the race if he does well in the Nebraska primary. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If there is a path to victory, we launched this campaign intending to win. The reason we suspended the race last week is with Indiana's loss, I didn't see a viable path to victory. If that changes, we will certainly respond accordingly.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Chief Washington correspondent James Rosen has more. James?JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, good evening. In his first appearance at his Senate office since February, Ted Cruz returned to what he called, with a touch of sarcasm, the welcoming embrace of Washington. The Texas senator made clear he has no plan to endorse presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump anytime soon. No time to release his delegates anytime soon and no real plan to re-enter the race should he win Nebraska. As he seen in a light-hearted interview with Glenn Beck earlier in the day to be leaving the door open to pursue.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: We're not going to win Nebraska today. There should be no mystery, no excitement in that. We've withdrawn from the campaign. And it's in the hands of the voters. If circumstances change, we will always assess the changed circumstances but I appreciate the eagerness and excitement of all the folks in the media to see me back in the ring. But we may have to wait a little bit longer.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: Also making a splashy return to the capital, Marco Rubio talking foreign policy at the conservative Hudson Institute Think Tank. The Florida senator who is holding on to his delegates said he wouldn't spent the next six months taking shot at Trump. Even as he rejected Trump's rhetoric about the U.S. paying too much to defend regional allies.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUBIO: And I don't necessarily disagree that sometimes our efforts on behalf of others is disproportional. What we think is the return or the gratitude of others. But we also have to understand that we have benefited from this arrangement economically, politically, geopolitically, even domestically. If you think back of what it would have been, what would age it look like today if the United States has not been engaged in efforts to help Japan rebuild.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: Now, the Cruz campaign or what remains of it, may define pm deadline on Monday to file the slate of delegates for California primary next month. Cruz's state director told us that was just, quote, ""to keep faith with our supporters"" -- Megyn.KELLY: Hmm. James, thank you.Joining me now with reaction, Herman Cain, a former GOP presidential candidate, Fox News contributor, and the author of ""The Right Problems: What the President, Congress, and Every Candidate Should Be Working On.""Great to see you, Herman. Thanks for being here. What do you make of this Ted Cruz business? You know, if I win, he didn't win Nebraska. And then he said, I knew I wasn't going to win Nebraska. Is this guy thinking about get back in, do you think?HERMAN CAIN, FORMER GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't think so. He's throwing a handful of mud in the water. It was already murky enough with this whole anti-Trump Never Trump movement. So now Ted Cruz has just muddied the waters even more. Here's the other significant thing about him saying that, and even alluding to it. I understand that he wants to try to give his supporters a little bit of hope. But this further divides the Republican Party and Ted Cruz, like Marco Rubio, said they will support the ultimate nominee. Marco Rubio just said that he would. Ted Cruz is muddying the water and going back on his word. That's not going to get him a path to victory and it's not going to set well with the voters.KELLY: How does, you know, Ted Cruz even attempt to work this out with Donald Trump or vice versa? Because, you know, Ted Cruz, last we heard from him on supporting Trump, he said, I'm not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife. And then the last day in Indiana, Trump attacked Ted Cruz's father, suggesting he was in on the JFK assassination. So that happened. So who reaches out to whom?CAIN: Well, I think that Donald Trump has shown, he will sit down and talk with anyone, even if he has differences with them. But as long as Ted Cruz says he's not going to support him, he's not going to do this and he's not going to say he's willing to sit down, then I think --KELLY: He didn't go quite that far. He didn't go --CAIN: Right.KELLY: Mitt Romney went that far but Ted Cruz --CAIN: Mitt Romney went that far. Right. Now, let's look at the meeting that's supposed to take place on Thursday as an example. Donald Trump welcomed the meeting with Ryan and Priebus. That is a good move. He didn't say, okay, no, I'm not going to talk. No, he's willing to talk. So, but as long as Ted Cruz keeps saying, I'm not going to support the nominee --KELLY: I might not.CAIN: The presumptive nominee is now Donald Trump, that way he's digging in his heels and continuing to throw mud in it. When Ted Cruz suspended his campaign, I thought it was the first step on his part to help healing the Republican Party. Now, he has stepped back in terms of helping to heal the Republican Party.KELLY: But what does Donald Trump need to do to heal? Because, you know, what the experts say is the victor is normally the one expected to reach out to those who have been defeated and say all right, come on, let's get together, you know, to be the gracious winner and try to bring those people into the polls. Now, I don't know what he's going to do about Mitt Romney who is out there saying, he will not vote Trump or Clinton --CAIN: Right.KELLY: And saying quote, I wish we had better choices which, you know, I don't know what the Republican Party is going to do about that, right?CAIN: Megyn, we started with 17 choices. We now have one. What are they looking for?KELLY: You.CAIN: You know, probably the choice, you know, the choice they want died on a cross 2,000 years ago. I keep trying to get that message over to them. But see, Trump issued an olive branch in his Indiana victory speech. When he commented on how tough a competitor Ted Cruz was. He didn't bash Cruz. He didn't bring up any of the old laundry. He said some very complimentary things about Ted Cruz. Now I think he's extending an olive branch. But now Cruz has done just the opposite. I'm not going to support Donald Trump. I'm not going to do this. And if there's a path to victory, was that isn't, he may consider it. I think that further divides the Republican Party.KELLY: Herman Cain, great to see you.CAIN: Thank you, Megyn.Also tonight, explosive new details in the claim that Facebook is doing things behind the scenes to hurt conservatives. And to promote Liberal causes. We have news on this. We'll bring it to you.Plus, Quinnipiac released a stunning poll today on Trump versus Clinton in three key swing states, key to the election in November. Our superstar panel has a new look at what it means right after this break. Don't go away.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: And it's why I've been so concerned about the reckless talk coming from Donald Trump. People say, well, maybe he doesn't really mean it. When you are running for serving as president, you'd better mean what you say.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight. Donald Trump has added to his delegate count tonight with win in both West Virginia and Nebraska. While Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton handily in the state of West Virginia. That comes on the same day, we got brand-new general election match-up polls out of three key swing states. Trump wins one state, and is inside the margin of error and two others. So even though Clinton is now beating Trump nationally in an average of all polls, there are new question about the idea that Clinton could win easily against the New York businessman.We've got a power panel on this. But first, John Roberts has the details. John?JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, good evening to you. It's a Quinnipiac poll. Three of the most important battleground states, Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Let's take a look at the numbers here, the Quinnipiac poll found that in Florida, Hillary Clinton beats Donald Trump by 43 percent to 42 percent. You said, within the margin of error. I mean, that is so far within the margin of error. It's literally dead even.Go to Pennsylvania now, she leads him by the same margin. But when we go to the state of Ohio, we always talk about Ohio being so important to the general election. Take a look at this, Donald Trump ahead 43 percent to 39 percent. Then as a four-point split. To break the poll down even further, she has a substantial lead among women. But he has an equal if not greater lead among men and they both pretty much split independent. So you couldn't have a race that's tighter than that. Now what do polls mean six months ahead of the election? Not a whole bunch because so much can change between now and November.So much can change between now and next week for that matter. But it's important for Donald Trump because you had a lot of those big Republican donors who had been sitting on the fence thinking, this guy is going to get blown out in November the same way that Mondale got blown up by Reagan in '84 or Goldwater got blown out in 1964. But this is an indication, Megyn, that maybe that assumption is incorrect and at this point in the race, it looks like he's got at least an even, if not better than even, shot to beat her in November. Again, a lot can happen between now and November.One of the big things that can happen is this meeting with Paul Ryan on Thursday. I talked with the Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski earlier tonight and he says the two of them despite their differences still have a lot in common in terms of creating jobs, fixing the economy and lowering tax. Does he expect that Speaker Ryan is going to come out after that Thursday meeting and say I wholeheartedly throw my support behind Trump? Not necessarily. The Donald Trump did say earlier tonight on Bill O'Reilly he thinks the meeting is going to go well. So there's a chance that at least the two of them will come out of there saying, we have points of agreement which would be a very strong signal to conservatives in the Republican Party that maybe Donald Trump is not the type of person that they think he is, at least if Speaker Ryan can get behind him to some degree -- Megyn.KELLY: John Roberts, good to see you.ROBERTS: Good to see you too. Thanks.KELLY: Here with more, Ben Domenech, publisher of The Federalist. Monica Crowley, Fox News contributor and host of the Monica Crowley radio show. And Richard Socarides, White House senior advisor under President Bill Clinton and Democratic strategist. Good to see you, all.So, Ben, let me ask you, you haven't been a huge supporter of Donald Trump's. But what do you make of these new polls?BEN DOMENECH, PUBLISHER, THE FEDERALIST: I think these polls indicate that Donald Trump absolutely has a path to beating Hillary Clinton. It's another sign that if he doubles down on his appeal to Rust Belt voters who are less economically conservative than a lot of other voters that are within the Republican Party, that he absolutely has a path to making Ohio, Pennsylvania, perhaps even Michigan competitive states. Bernie Sanders, you will remember, won Michigan by a significant margin. It's also an indication that maybe the split on the Democratic side is going to be a more significant problem for Hillary Clinton entering a general election campaign.You saw the win in West Virginia tonight by Bernie Sanders. Is she going to be able to unite her own party? We had all these questions about the Republican side. Maybe it's the Democrats who are going to have a bigger problem when it comes to an actual divide.KELLY: Richard, are you surprised that it is this tight in Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania, at least according to this one poll?RICHARD SOCARIDES, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I'm not surprised because of course those are the most competitive states in every election. And that's why they're called battleground states, right. I do think that polling at this point in the election doesn't really matter very much because most voters have not really tuned into the election. And, in fact, now, there are a lot of polls that show Hillary Clinton winning in these states and there are also the polling -- the poll of polls, shows her about seven points ahead of Mr. Trump nationally, which of course would be a blow out. But, listen, I think it's clear, you know, we've all underestimated Donald Trump during this primary season and I think this is going to be a very tough and competitive race. But I think when people focus on the issues and focus on the kinds of things that Mr. Trump has said and the kinds of crazy things he stands for, that Hillary Clinton will be the clear victor.KELLY: The thing is, Monica, it may come down largely to what kind of campaigns they run. And the question is whether Hillary Clinton is a good campaigner.MONICA CROWLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, and I think that she has a proven track record, Megyn, of not being a very effective campaigner. She is not her husband. And I think that's causing a lot of discomfort for a lot of Democrats. She can't even really call on her husband, who's been out there, and use sort of judiciously by the Clinton campaign, but not -- he's not the powerhouse that he once was. I think what is surprising for a lot of people, taking a look at particularly the battleground numbers, Megyn, is the fact that it's tightened so quickly. And I would just say to keep in mind that Donald Trump has been in a sprawling Republican primary. That's the race he's been waging now for the last, what, 10 months or so. Now, that it's switching to a general election campaign, and he is training his political fire on Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats more broadly, that's why you're seeing the numbers now start to tighten. I think you will see a continuing shift in those numbers, now that we've moved into a new phase of the campaign.KELLY: The problem for Trump in this, Ben, is that his record is his record. And that he threw a lot of sharp elbows over the past 9, 10 months, and there's a record of them.DOMENECH: There's a record of them. It's going to be used against him in a general election. And it's, you know -- frankly, it is a pretty fiery record. A lot of pretty crazy quotes and things were said over the course of this primary campaign. But the fact of the matter is he was able to dispatch what the other 16 Republican candidates. And on the Democratic side, I mean, granted it's not quite as appealing to see the equivalents of Larry David arguing over what makes a nice piece of fish, but it is the sort of situation that is a real conflict over the issues, over ideological things that matter to Democratic voters. I feel like in this context, as mean as this primary may have been on the Republican side, the divides within the Democratic side may actually turn out to be more significant because it has to do with those issues that you were talking about before, that are very divisive within the Democratic coalition.KELLY: What's going to be really ugly is if she emerges as the nominee and goes head to head with Trump. I want to tell you that we are getting some brand-new exit polling. Donald Trump, he won big tonight in Nebraska and West Virginia. And he did so because the voters continue to be receptive to his populous message. I want to ask Richard about this in a moment. Look at this. These are from West Virginia. Two-thirds think trade takes jobs away from American workers. About half feel betrayed by Republican Party politicians. Nearly half angry with the federal government. We've seen this over and over again. As a result of this, a lot of these voters want to change. And for them that candidate is Trump. Numbers in Nebraska look similar. Sanders won West Virginia. And you can see how. He had support from the usual groups, young people, independents, he picked up some of Clinton's groups, women, seniors. Look at these. Look at these, 71 percent with young voters, Sanders gets, 61 percent of independents, 52 percent of women he's winning. And on and on it goes. So let me go back to the panel. Richard, the Democrats are not united. They are not united. Does it worry you?SOCARIDES: It does not worry me because I think we will be united, and I think you have to really look at the facts. I mean, those exit polls from West Virginia and Nebraska are interesting. West Virginia and Nebraska are hardly representatives of the country. I would dispute the notion that Hillary Clinton is not a good candidate. I think she has been an excellent candidate. She was elected twice as senator of New York, she almost won the.(CROSSTALK)SOCARIDES: She almost won the Democratic nomination for president eight years ago. She's about to secure.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: The point is, she can get -- Hillary and Trump, as they're fighting each other, they're going to be fighting for the middle. I guess it's weird with Trump, you will never know.(CROSSTALK)SOCARIDES: Listen, I think though, it's going to be clear. I think it's going to be a tough campaign. It's going to be very competitive. But the choice is going to be so clear for voters, whether you want to take a risky chance on someone like Mr. Trump who's all over the place, who changes his mind all the time, who suggested that, you know, his foreign policy experience consists of going to the Ms. America pageant in Moscow. I mean, this guy is not going to be elected president. Now, I know we've underestimated him before. I know he has been proven a very effective politician. But I think when the country is focused on this, and when all Americans are focused on what it means for our country, the choice is going to be clear.KELLY: There are a lot of world leaders there. You're being too tough on him. Monica, your thoughts on that.CROWLEY: You know, what's interesting, Megyn, is that even at this late date, neither one of the front-runners really has locked down their bases. So Donald Trump is now in a position of reassuring conservatives, meeting with Republican leaders, trying to get the Republican Party united behind him. Mrs. Clinton has also not locked down her base. Her base is with Bernie Sanders.(CROSSTALK)CROWLEY: Let me just finish my point. So Mrs. Clinton has the serious problem of her base is now with the other guy who remains in the race. But even more importantly, Mrs. Clinton has been on the national scene for something like 30 years and she has serious challenges because the majority of the American people find her dishonest and untrustworthy. So she has a huge mountain to climb, especially she is running against the candidate who doesn't care she's a Clinton and doesn't care she's a woman, and has thrown the rule book out. She's going to face a race unlike anything.KELLY: Go ahead, Richard.(CROSSTALK)SOCARIDES: I just think you know we have to look at the facts, right. Bernie Sanders has said that he will support the Democratic nominee and he will do everything in his power and campaign his heart out for the Democratic nominee in order to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president. So I think the Democrats are already a lot more unified than the Republicans. And I think the choice will be clear.KELLY: Go ahead, Ben.DOMENECH: I think the choice is between candidates who represent change and candidates who represent the status quo. The reason that there's so much energy behind Bernie Sanders and there's been so much energy behind Donald Trump is because people are angry about the status quo. There is no better candidate to represent the status quo than Hillary Clinton. And that's going to be a problem for her.CROWLEY: Yeah, the redevelop is against the bipartisan ruling class. So you see the populous revolt happening with Bernie Sanders on the left and with Donald Trump on the right.(CROSSTALK)SOCARIDES: I think there's a lot about Hillary Clinton that does not represent the status quo. First and foremost, the fact that we will be electing the first female president of our country.KELLY: All right. OK. She's going to have to do better than that. It's not just going to be the woman thing that is going to get her into office. We all know that. All right. Great to see you all.CROWLEY: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: And that is a good thing for women because it's not just your sex or your gender that gets you in or keeps you out hopefully.Up next, former Facebook employees claim the site is going out of its way to prevent conservative stories from getting attention. And tonight conservatives are firing back. Howie Kurtz joins us on that.Plus, the Belgian-owned company that owns Budweiser has decided to do away with one of the best-known brand names in America. Really? Is this true? The story behind that just ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, new developments on a bombshell report alleging that Facebook selectively chooses what is trending on its site, based on political bias against conservatives. And tonight, the social media giant is facing mounting pressure to account for its methods. We'll get reaction from critic Howard Kurtz in a moment. But first, Trace Gallagher in our West Coast Newsroom with the report. Trace.TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, the trending box appears in the top right-hand side of the Facebook homepage, with an ever changing list of popular stories. Facebook has not explained how those stories are chosen except to say algorithms scan what's trending on the web and then a team of so-called news curators check to see if the stories are in fact news. But a former news curator tells that the technology blog (inaudible) that the trending feature is suppressing news stories about conservatives, excluding links to conservative news outlets, and promoting progressive stories like things with #BlackLivesMatter. In other words, manipulating what we see.Facebook executive Tom Stocky, who for the record, is a Hillary Clinton campaign donor, denies the allegations, saying, quote, there are rigorous guidelines in place for the review team to ensure consistency and neutrality. These guidelines do not permit the suppression of political perspectives. And it turns out Facebook has enormous influence on the news we consume.According to Pew research, 61 percent of 18-year-olds to 33-year-olds, or millennials get more of their political news from Facebook than any other source. It is also a primary news outlet for 40 percent of baby boomers. Now, South Dakota Republican Senator John Thune who is chair of the Senate Commerce Committee has sent a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wanting answers about how the company chooses its trending topics, and whether Facebook is using an objective algorithm. Facebook is now reviewing that letter. Megyn.KELLY: Trace, thank you. Joining me now, the host of ""MediaBuzz"" here on Fox News, Howard Kurtz. Howie, good to see you. If this is true, it's deeply troubling. The allegation from this former anonymous as of now worker is that if the news was trending and it had to do with Mitt Romney, Rand Paul, C-PAC, Glenn Beck, Ted Cruz, drug report, Lois Lerner, things like that, if it was trending, pursuant to the algorithm, they would take it out of the trending column. And if news regarding things like Black Lives Matter or Syria was not trending, they would move it in. So they would actively manipulate the data.HOWARD KURTZ, ""MEDIABUZZ"" HOST: These allegations, Megyn, really strike at the heart of Facebook as a neutral platform, to hear journalists were hired by Facebook to fiddle with the formulas, to inject their own opinion, not all of them, perhaps some with anti-conservative bias, as Trace Gallagher just explained, it really amounts to cooking the digital books, if true. And this is a massive public company that depends on its users to post a lot of personal information. If it loses that trust, it's got a big problem.KELLY: According to this whistleblower who is an anonymous at this point, and so we haven't been able to check this person's credibility, but the report is that they provided, they kept records of the manipulation and provided them. But they're saying stories covered by conservative outlets like Breitbart, Washington Examiner, Newsmax, that were trending were excluded, unless mainstream sites like the New York Times, BBC, and CNN covered the same stories. Think of what that does. Think of what that does in a presidential race, right. If Ted Cruz is trending, but he can't get trending on Facebook because it's being too dominated by others who are sucking up the oxygen.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: People would cull the information.KURTZ: Right. Some are calling this Trend-ghazi. And the fact you need some kind of mainstream media stamp of approval, because the Washington Examiner is not enough. Now, look, even these anonymous sources that spoke to the tech site, Gizmoto, they don't say that there's any top-down management directive about this, but it is important for our viewers to know that, for example Mark Zuckerberg openly supports President Obama on his immigration policy, that he gave a speech last month pretty openly ripping Donald Trump and that Facebook employees, some of them in an internal survey, asked this question, what should Facebook's responsibility be to prevent President Trump in 2017?(CROSSTALK)KELLY: We don't know how to answer that. He may have responded by saying no responsibility, we stay out of politics?KURTZ: It tells you something about the sentiment within Facebook. People are entitled to their opinions, they're entitled to donate money, but this is not just some website. This is the giant social network that basically tells us it doesn't.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: I mean, Senator Thune now wants them to account for their trending possess, which you tell me, does that cross a line?KURTZ: Well, as troubling as these allegations are to me, I don't want the government locking around in this. If a Republican senator, or if any United States senator demanded for information about how to you make your editorial decisions to the New York Times, to CBS, to Fox News, I think there would be an uproar. I think the lawmaker would be told to go jump in the lake because, you know, this is not the business of the government. I think Facebook should investigate all this. I think Facebook owes the public a better explanation, but I'm not sure it should be the subject of a federal government investigation.KELLY: They do say they're investigating. To their credit, they had said, look, no matter where you fall on the political spectrum, our guidelines require that the review team members allow all points of view. We've seen the allegations that folks did not honor the intent of the guidelines. We take the allegations seriously. We're continuing to investigate. So I feel like you know we'll see more Facebook on this. They're going to have to let us know what happened.(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: I want to see an aggressive investigation.KELLY: All night. Well done. Good to see you, Howie. I will give you a light, too.KURTZ: Yes.KELLY: Coming up, with the intense political season heating up this summer, the folks who own Budweiser decided it's a good time to reach for an ice cold can of America.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah.KELLY: You know how that really goes. Nevermind, I swore last night. I can't swear two nights in a row. Trace Gallagher is next as to what could be the end for one of the world's best-known brand names.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: I had to dig deep into the archives for that one. The Budweiser -- the Budweiser Clydesdales have been part of the beer company's ad campaign since 1933. The beer, itself, has been around since 1876. Soon, the Budweiser name may be no more. The owners, a Belgian company, called in -- called Inbev, are planning for a name change. They should start with the name of the company, not the beer, right? Trace Gallagher.GALLAGHER: Yeah. Inbev, Anheuser-Busch, whatever, except for the fact it's owned by a Belgian company and run by a Brazilian company, what could be more American than Budweiser? So beginning May 23rd, and going through the presidential election, the Budweiser logo on 12-ounce cans and bottles will be replaced with America. The company says because of the Summer Olympics and the election, they're trying to inspire drinkers to celebrate Budweiser's shared values of freedom and authenticity. Along with the name change, the labels will also have lines from the Pledge of Allegiance, Star Spangled Banner, and America the Beautiful. Reaction has been somewhat mixed, so we did our own informal marketing survey. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why not? It's due for a change, Budweiser.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I could live with it. I love America.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think they ought to stick with Budweiser. I don't know why they would change.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Some tongue in cheek comments online say they finally understand what Donald Trump's hat stands for. And others wonder if Bud Light will soon change its name to Merica, you know, a George W. Bush pronunciation. Past Budweiser cans have also featured the Statue of Liberty and American flag. Anheuser-Busch, Inbev, sells 25 percent of the world's beer. The U.S. is their strongest market. But sales have dipped recently, so maybe this is kind of a way to boost them back up. Megyn.KELLY: America is not a beer. We'll be right back.GALLAGHER: Right.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: One week from tonight, my interview with Donald Trump.
