Olbermann tweeted. ""Now that I've escaped, I can report to you that the market in NYC @RealDonaldTrump apartments is in a free fall.""In a statement reported by The Hollywood Reporter, Olbermann said the closing on his apartment included talk about the unsold inventory at Trump-named buildings in New York City.""Leaving aside his politics for the moment, his reputation in real estate is now in ruins,"" Olbermann reportedly stated. ""I suspect this all ends with his name being removed from the building -- like the day they yanked down the statue of Saddam Hussein. Maybe it'll be renamed Hillary Palace.""Olbermann, a sports and political commentator and writer, bought the Trump Palace condo in 2007 for $4.2 million. He went public with his decision to leave the place with an opinion piece in the Washington Post, writing, ""I can't stand to live in a Trump building anymore.""The posh apartment is wrapped in windows with north, south, and east exposures, and features terraces with eye-popping views of Central Park and the George Washington Bridge."
