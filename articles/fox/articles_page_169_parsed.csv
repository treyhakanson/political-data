This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEPHEN MOORE, WALL STREET JOURNAL: This was really disappointing news for the economy, because the one area that has really been doing well over the last couple of years has really rebounded and hiring workers has been the manufacturing sector of the economy. Now we're seeing that area slow down. So you wonder where the growth is going to come from in the economy if even manufacturing has slowed down.(END VIDEO CLIP)JOHN ROBERTS, GUEST HOST: Stephen Moore of the Wall Street Journal talking about the contraction in American manufacturing, the first in three years.We're back with our panel.A.B., is this a result of what's going on in Europe? Have we here in the United States caught the contagion?A.B. STODDARD, THEHILL.COM: This is what contagion looks like. Not only is the Eurozone in crisis and no one is confident it's going to be repaired soon enough to make a difference. But the Chinese economy is contracting. They are buying fewer of our goods. And because the dollar is weak against the euro our products are more expensive when they buy them.We are not looking at estimates for good growth for a long time let alone before the next election. And if I could repeat myself we do have this fiscal clip coming at the end of the year that both parties and the president know is coming. It is freezing taxation rates or blowing them up so the companies don't know what their rates will be in '13. There's no reason for them to hire and we can't expect any improvement until that is resolved.ROBERTS: Charles, you think this is as much about the president's policies as you do what is happening in Europe?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Of course. I mean the Europe thing is another one of his dodges. It was the tsunami, it was -- it was the bad weather, it was the supply lines in Japan, it was the Bush administration. It was -- now it's Europe and China. It's always something else. The thing is he gave us the largest stimulus in galactic history and it was supposed to actually start our own economy internally and create demand. That was all about it. I mean he said that's the Keynesian idea you create demand. It's all gone, and the money is gone, and we're growing in 1.7 percent.(CROSSTALK)ROBERTS: There's talk about --KRAUTHAMMER: That's why.ROBERTS: There's talk about QE3, another round of quantitative easing.KRAUTHAMMER: It's not going to help Obama because it would kick in after the election.ROBERTS: You know something that's coming right up. Some of us will be working tomorrow. And I thank you, gentlemen, for coming in. A.B. is going to barbecuing hamburgers. But big number coming out at the end of the week, and that is the June jobs number.What does all that we see now, Stephen, portend for that figure?STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Well, this might be one of those rare occasions where the -- you know, when the job numbers are bad we keep hearing that this was an unexpectedly bad job number. I think people are expecting a really bad job number -- jobs number this time. I mean every indication -- we've gone -- we have gone from sort of a period of stasis, a period of treading water to a period of moving backwards to now, the potential that things really bottom out. And, you know, if that's the case it obviously has horrendous implications for the U.S. economy for the so-called recovery. But it also has significant political implications here potentially.ROBERTS: There were some predictions, A.B., of less than one percent growth between now and the end of the year, which for the entire year based on the numbers we've seen so far, it's not far to go from there back in the recession again.STODDARD: I think that given the picture we are going to be talking about teetering at the edge of a recession again and again. If you look at the numbers and the manufacturing outlook right now, it's really hard to see how this is fixed in the short-term.ROBERTS: President has got a bus trip of two Midwestern states, Ohio and Pennsylvania, coming up, Charles. He's going to be touting his economic record. Is that a record to run on?KRAUTHAMMER: Well, the theme, all he can salvage is to say we're growing, we're getting -- we're healing but slower than I would like. Well, the numbers at the end of the week on the unemployment in June are bad, and the way that the growth rate is 1.7 percent you can't decrease unemployment. It's too slow a growth rate. He is not going to have that narrative anymore. That we're getting, we're improving but too slowly. We'll be slipping backwards.So I think it can be devastating. Look, this is the third summer of recovery in a row. That's not a summer of recovery. Three strikes and you're out.ROBERTS: Right. Now talking about this idea of the record to run on, Mitt Romney looked like he had lost his signature issue three months ago when the economy looked like it was cooking along. Does he have his signature issue back again?HAYES: You know, that's a very good question. And certainly the Romney camp thinks so because they're talking about virtually nothing else. I mean in light of the health care decision and the enthusiasm that that generated among conservatives, the $5 million roughly in 24 hours, team Romney seems to be pivoting back to the economy. They want to be talking about the economy. And I think in the anticipation of these jobs numbers.The question I would ask, though is, is that big enough? Is that enough? I mean, yes, everybody tells pollsters that they want -- that the economy is number one. Unemployment is the number one issue. But it hasn't had the effect on the race that one might expect at this point.I mean the Gallup Tracking poll yesterday was Obama 48, Romney, 43. After two horrible months for President Obama. So is the economy enough? Is it OK to run on the one issue? I think that's something that the Romney team is having to grapple with right now.ROBERTS: All right. We'll see how they do.Thanks so much for joining us. A.B., enjoy the holiday and we'll see you gentlemen again tomorrow.That's it for the panel.Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

2	2	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/05/14/marco-rubio-outlines-foreign-policy-doctrine/	Marco Rubio outlines foreign policy doctrine	"This is a RUSH transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" May 13, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: ""Impact Segment"" tonight, this afternoon Senator Marco Rubio, who is running for president, gave a foreign policy speech in front of the Council on Foreign Relations here in New York City. The Senator joins us now.So keeping it simple, what's the most important thing America has to do overseas right this moment?RUBIO: Well, there's three things that should underline our foreign policy.The first is the acknowledgment that the world is a better place and America is the strongest country in the world and that's why we need to increase our military spending. Get rid of these horrible reductions that we have seen and also our intelligence capability, they have to be robust. It is important that we re-authorize the Patriot Act.Second is America's foreign policy needs to keep in mind that in the 21st century global commerce matters more than ever. We cannot allow any nation on earth to control shipping lanes, airspace, the cyberspace, outer space for that matter.O'REILLY: Ok.RUBIO: And the third is our foreign policy should always be built on our values as a nation. We support freedom. We support nations and people who aspire to democracy. We support human rights and the respect to human rights.O'REILLY: But we can't nation build anymore.RUBIO: No.O'REILLY: It didn't work in Iraq.RUBIO: You don't have to.O'REILLY: I agree. There is another way to do it but you can't get down and try to convince the Afghans to be democratic.RUBIO: No. But I'll give you an example, Cuba, right? We are doing all these relations with Cuba under the President and none of this was there ever a discussion about democracy which is not just in our national interest but it's a strong value of the United States.O'REILLY: As you know, the thinking is if we get in there, we, being the United States, with our value system and people go there and spend money the Cuban people say hey, we want to be like them. So it's one of those.RUBIO: That didn't work in Vietnam or China. They're still a communist people.O'REILLY: No, but Cuba is only 90 miles away. I think it might work. I think that the influx of dollars and Americans into Cuba might give those people saying you know we really don't like that anymore.RUBIO: Yes. But all of that will go into a government holding company that owns the entire economy.O'REILLY: That's right. And who is not giving any kind of freedoms at all to the --RUBIO: Right.O'REILLY: -- you know, no human rights, they didn't do anything.All right. Let's get to Hillary Clinton. If you win the nomination, and your campaign is off to an impressive start and I'm not saying that. The polls show that. Where is she weakest? Where is Hillary Clinton weakest?RUBIO: To answer that question, let's understand where we stand. For much of the 20th century, America was the greatest country in the world. Some very basic promises -- we were the most powerful nation on earth. We had an economy that told you if you work hard in this country you may not be rich but you will own a home. You'll be able to raise your family, take vacations.O'REILLY: Your parents did that.RUBIO: They lived that out. Now it doesn't exist anymore for millions of people and everyone is wondering why. Why don't the old way of doing things work anymore? The answer is because the world -- our economy and the world has rapidly transformed. We need transformational leadership, leadership that understands this new era --O'REILLY: But those are all slogans.RUBIO: No, but it's the truth.O'REILLY: Mrs. Clinton is going to say to you if you are debating her look I'm going to have government programs that's going to lift people up and stop this income inequality. I'm going to do this, all right? So is that a weakness for her to say that?RUBIO: But they are not -- first of all they're not slogans. That's what's happening in our country and the proposals she is going to come forward with are same tired left of center proposals that are failing us now -- the exact same ones.O'REILLY: But Obama says -- the President says, hey, I got us out of a depression. My policies are successful and it goes around and around in a merry-go-round.RUBIO: But they're not because her policies, number one, in a global economy would make us less globally competitive. You can't raise taxes, increase regulations, grow your national debt and expect to be able to compete with dozens of developed economies.O'REILLY: Ok. But that's a ""Wall Street Journal"" argument. You've got to get down -- I'm giving him advice here. You have got to be a gut fighter here.Look Romney and McCain tried to do what you are saying. They have tried to appeal to the American sense of traditional economics and traditional defense.RUBIO: Right.O'REILLY: And they lost.RUBIO: But the problem is that today you have millions of people that are finding that the jobs they have had for 20 years don't allow them to be in the middle class anymore. Why? Because this new economy is either wiping out those jobs or they don't pay enough. So you have to have an economy not just to create the new jobs that pay more but you have to have a higher education system that gives people 21st century skills. And she wants to pour money into tired programs that don't give you those skills.O'REILLY: But those tired programs are now supporting 50 percent of the American households or getting some kinds means-testing which is beyond Social Security and Medicare money. They don't want to give the money up. That's her constituency.RUBIO: I think the vast majority of Americans would prefer to have a better paying job but they don't have the skills for that higher paying job or America isn't creating enough of them because we are not globally competitive.O'REILLY: Well, we have to unleash the free marketplace.But Hillary Clinton herself, all right? You are going to attack her as being dishonest woman? Are you going to do that?RUBIO: Well, I will tell you what we can't afford.O'REILLY: No, no. Are you going to say that Hillary Clinton is dishonest?RUBIO: Look, we don't need any drama in the White House at this incredible hinge moment in our history. You're going to put back in the White House two people who have been everywhere they go bring drama with them. This country can not afford another eight years of a soap opera.O'REILLY: Are you going to point out what the dramas are?RUBIO: Absolutely. We see what they are already.O'REILLY: So you're going to go and say listen. If I were running for president I would say, listen, I want the FBI to investigate the Clinton Foundation.RUBIO: Well, her time as secretary of state is now filled with drama because of the e-mail scandal. The foundation is filled with drama because of ties between the foundation and business deals.O'REILLY: Do you want an FBI investigation into that?RUBIO: If it's appropriate. First of all --(CROSSTALK)O'REILLY: Do you think it's appropriate?RUBIO: Well, we don't know enough about it yet.O'REILLY: How are we ever going to know if the FBI doesn't investigate?RUBIO: Well, ultimately I think we are going to find out more about these --O'REILLY: How?RUBIO: Well, you know, the House Oversight Committee is looking into the e-mail problems and from that I think we will know a lot more information.O'REILLY: But House looked at the IRS scandal and couldn't get to first base.RUBIO: And that's because the Justice Department doesn't want to move forward on it under this president. But the truth is that if this evidence were to come forward it would compel them to act. But at the end of the day Americans see it for what its. They understand that we are in a time of extraordinary uncertainty about our future. What kind of country are we going to be? We cannot afford to have drama in the White House.O'REILLY: All right.RUBIO: All right.O'REILLY: It's fun. Is it fun so far for you?RUBIO: It has been. It's a lot of work.O'REILLY: It's a lot of work. If you start to become the frontrunner, you are going to get attacked. You are ready for that.RUBIO: Yes. That happens all the time.O'REILLY: You're going to be a sexist. You're going to be racist. You're going to be whatever -ist they can put on you.RUBIO: Well.O'REILLY: But you are always welcome here and we appreciate you coming on in.RUBIO: Thank you.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.

3	3	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2012/06/29/all-star-panel-politics-mandate-tax/	All-Star Panel: Politics of mandate as a tax	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" June 28, 2012. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: And I can make a firm pledge, under my plan, no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase, not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you still make that promise to people today? OBAMA: I can still keep that promise because, as I said, about two- third of what we've proposed would be from money that's already in the health care system but just being spent badly. If your family earns less than $250,000 a year, a quarter million dollars a year, you will not see your taxes increased a single dime. I repeat -- not one single dime. (APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: President Obama repeated many times that the healthcare mandate, health care law was not a tax increase, absolutely rejecting that notion many times. Now the only reason that it is upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court is because it has been listed as a tax increase. We're back with the panel. The politics of this, how it plays, A.B.? A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, THE HILL: Well, Republicans have retained the grassroots energy from opponents of health care reform. And this will be -- they will be engaged and this will be an incredible political benefit for Mitt Romney. This -- again, we are looking at a bunch of income taxes possibly being raised December 31 of this year. Republicans will certainly campaign against this as a tax increase. The one problem is for Republicans, is that if they spend too much time talking about health care, and the mandate, after the Fast and Furious investigation, and the fact that the court has ruled that the mandate was constitutional, under the commerce clause -- I mean under the power to tax. There is going to be a voter who maybe wasn't of a strong opinion on this who says when are they just going to shut up and start talking about the economy again? There is a little bit of a risk of overreaching and seeming once again like you have taken your focus off of jobs. BAIER: But we're hearing that from Democrats today, it's time to move on.  ""Move on"" was the phrase we heard repeatedly, Charles. CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: But that's, of course, absurd. The law hasn't even taken effect. How can you abandon an argument about a law that is about to impact everybody's life? So I think it's a very strong Republican argument. I think yes, Obama has a victory today, the prestige is raised.  He doesn't crash and burn. However he now has an issue on his hands which was extremely strong in defeating the Republicans in 2010 -- BAIER: The Democrats in 2010 KRAUTHAMMER: -- I'm sorry, the Democrats in 2010. Yes, the intensity is less, and, yes, the effect is less. However, the Republicans have a very strong argument. It isn't only that it's going to raise your taxes. It's the bigger, the larger argument about Obama expanding government, expanding the debt, expanding spending in a way that is unconscionable to a lot of Americans.  And that I think is going to be the central argument. That hasn't changed.  Yes, Romney had instituted something like it, in Massachusetts, but elections are about the future, not the past. Romney says I'll abolish it on day one. That is still a very strong argument. BAIER: Jeff, what about this argument that Republicans, many of them have taken it today and said if the president had said this is a tax from the very beginning, or if Democrats had sold that, it would have gone down in flames in the Senate. It just wouldn't have had support. So is it disingenuous, then, to pass a bill on something that it's not and then it really is?JEFF ZELENY, NEW YORK TIMES: I guess it wasn't disingenuous at the time. But you're right.  Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska would not have been the 60th vote had it been a tax. He would not have been joined by Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, or Mark Pryor of Arkansas, or Claire McCaskill of Missouri, on and on and on. So I think at the time it was not presented as that.I think you probably have to take the president at his word in those interviews because it would have been politically risky for them to sort of present this as a tax. This was just as we said in the earlier panel, this was Chief Justice Roberts looking for an endgame here. And you know, who knows what he had on his mind? He knew that this ruling would be interpreted as it's being interpreted, so a short-term gain. We don't know how this will play out between now and November. The one sort of challenge for Governor Romney is he is not probably the strongest messenger to make the argument of a tax here. Because he has a very similar situation in Massachusetts. He did not use the argument that other Republicans on the Hill were using today. He just said simply elect me, repeal Obamacare. But once -- if this becomes a full-on argument about is this a tax or not, he is going to again be tripped up by the Massachusetts mandate. BAIER: Judge? NAPOLITANO: I think this is a gift to Governor Romney. I think this will drive Republicans toward -- conservatives toward him, many of whom had some doubts about him. I have a few friends with whom I communicate on Twitter and Facebook from time to time. These are very small government people. They are beside themselves over this. And may actually take a look at Governor Romney because they don't want President Obama to be in office and to implement this. If he plays it right, he will draw a lot of votes that he otherwise might not have gotten. BAIER: The Romney campaign is already citing the millions that have come in since the vote came in. KRAUTHAMMER: I think it does help him. I don't think people are interested in what he did in Massachusetts. This is about intrusiveness of government, this is the best example of it. And that's the arguments with which Republicans are going to win if they're going to win in November. BAIER: Up next, the Eric Holder contempt vote.

Yes, the intensity is less, and, yes, the effect is less. However, the Republicans have a very strong argument. It isn't only that it's going to raise your taxes. It's the bigger, the larger argument about Obama expanding government, expanding the debt, expanding spending in a way that is unconscionable to a lot of Americans.  And that I think is going to be the central argument. That hasn't changed.  Yes, Romney had instituted something like it, in Massachusetts, but elections are about the future, not the past. Romney says I'll abolish it on day one. That is still a very strong argument. BAIER: Jeff, what about this argument that Republicans, many of them have taken it today and said if the president had said this is a tax from the very beginning, or if Democrats had sold that, it would have gone down in flames in the Senate. It just wouldn't have had support. So is it disingenuous, then, to pass a bill on something that it's not and then it really is?JEFF ZELENY, NEW YORK TIMES: I guess it wasn't disingenuous at the time. But you're right.  Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska would not have been the 60th vote had it been a tax. He would not have been joined by Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, or Mark Pryor of Arkansas, or Claire McCaskill of Missouri, on and on and on. So I think at the time it was not presented as that.I think you probably have to take the president at his word in those interviews because it would have been politically risky for them to sort of present this as a tax. This was just as we said in the earlier panel, this was Chief Justice Roberts looking for an endgame here. And you know, who knows what he had on his mind? He knew that this ruling would be interpreted as it's being interpreted, so a short-term gain. We don't know how this will play out between now and November. The one sort of challenge for Governor Romney is he is not probably the strongest messenger to make the argument of a tax here. Because he has a very similar situation in Massachusetts. He did not use the argument that other Republicans on the Hill were using today. He just said simply elect me, repeal Obamacare. But once -- if this becomes a full-on argument about is this a tax or not, he is going to again be tripped up by the Massachusetts mandate. BAIER: Judge? NAPOLITANO: I think this is a gift to Governor Romney. I think this will drive Republicans toward -- conservatives toward him, many of whom had some doubts about him. I have a few friends with whom I communicate on Twitter and Facebook from time to time. These are very small government people. They are beside themselves over this. And may actually take a look at Governor Romney because they don't want President Obama to be in office and to implement this. If he plays it right, he will draw a lot of votes that he otherwise might not have gotten. BAIER: The Romney campaign is already citing the millions that have come in since the vote came in. KRAUTHAMMER: I think it does help him. I don't think people are interested in what he did in Massachusetts. This is about intrusiveness of government, this is the best example of it. And that's the arguments with which Republicans are going to win if they're going to win in November. BAIER: Up next, the Eric Holder contempt vote.
