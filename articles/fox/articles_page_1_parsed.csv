This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Hillary Clinton's only experience in cyber security involves her criminal scheme to violate federal law, engineering a massive cover-up and putting the entire nation in harm's way.HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: He talks us down. He makes disparaging comments about our country. He calls our military a disaster. Well, it's not, but it might have been if everybody else had failed to pay taxes to support our brave men and women in uniform.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on the stump today as we have some new polls. First of all, the FOX average of recent polls, this is national average. It's a race that includes the Libertarian Party and the Green Party as well. And you can see here that Hillary Clinton has a plus 2.2 up in the average of these recent polls. Here in Virginia, new poll out has Clinton up 42 percent to Trump's 35 percent. That is from Christopher Newport University. And then Quinnipiac came out with four state polls, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and you can take a look at how this breaks down. Ohio, the big driver for Donald Trump. But you see Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, very close, within the margin of error in those polls, the state polls form Quinnipiac.Let's bring in our panel out here on site: Syndicated columnist George Will, Heidi Przybyla, senior political reporter for USA Today, and Charles Hurt, political columnist for The Washington Times.OK, George, today on the trail a lot of talk about taxes. Hillary Clinton really hitting Donald Trump. Donald Trump saying she hasn't created a job.GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: She hasn't created a job. And he has done what I think most Americans want to do, which is minimize their tax obligation. And all of this controversy, what no one said is that anything he has done is illegal. It's an old saying that what is really shocking in America isn't what's done in and by Washington that is illegal by that what is done in and by Washington that's legal. And if there's any system in the world that is rigged, to use Mr. Trump's favorite word, it's the American tax code which is constructed by the well-lawyered, the well- represented, the well-lobbied for. It just happens that he happened to benefit from this. But, again, I'm not sure the American people are going to say, gosh, he shouldn't have used the loopholes that the people's representatives wrote.BAIER: The tax lawyers will say it's not a loophole. It's written in there. And carried forward is used by all kinds of people, including companies like GE and The New York Times and others. But she is hitting hard, Heidi, on the loss.HEIDI PRZYBYLA, USA TODAY: Exactly.BAIER: The 1995 loss of $1 billion and saying, ""Here's my question -- what kind of genius loses $1 billion in a single year."" Does that play?PRZYBYLA: This is where I think things get complicated for Trump because this isn't just one story that's going to live and die in the 24-hour news cycle. The New York Times has here identified a massive loss. We don't know whether it was accumulated over several years and then reported in 1995, where this is coming from, but it raises a lot of questions. And it cuts right to the question of Trump's record as a successful businessman.It could very well be that in other years he had gains which offset that. But this is going to start the drumbeat then for him to release those returns, prove that they were profitable, and prove that, in fact, he is a successful businessman, which is really the whole reason for his campaign and his sales pitch to a lot of these struggling middle class voters. He's told them, I can do for you and do for the country what I did for my businesses.BAIER: Charlie, who is this affecting? Who is this changing? Is anybody's vote changing based on this tax story?CHARLES HURT, THE WASHINGTON TIMES: I don't think so at all because, as George said, people aren't -- don't identify with people that want to pay more taxes if they just had -- if they ignored certain loopholes. I think Heidi is right.But the problem is that, you know, Donald Trump, I think the reason that he has seen some trouble in the last couple of days has more to do with the incredible media coverage after the first debate, panning him, saying he got -- you know, he didn't have his best performance. And her performance was -- she was basically herself, which is not a very appealing thing either. And he missed a lot of opportunities to hit her on certain things. But I don't think it was nearly as bad as the media has portrayed it. But I think the buildup of media coverage about that debate has probably -- is the bigger reason why we're seeing some movement in a lot of these polls.BAIER: I do want to clear up one thing. Here is Donald Trump today talking about mental health issues and the military, specifically PTSD.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: When you talk about the mental health problems when people come back from war and combat and they see things that maybe a lot of folks in this room have seen many times over and you are strong and you can handle it, but a lot of people can't handle it. And they see horror stories. They see events that you couldn't see in a movie, nobody would believe it. We need a mental health help and medical. And it's one of the things that I think is least addressed.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Now, a lot of people jumped on that. A lot of people said he was making fun of PTSD or something. Chad, who was the veteran who asked Trump the question about PTSD, put out a statement saying ""I think it's sickening anyone would twist Mr. Trump's comments to me in order to pursue a political agenda. I took his comments to be thoughtful and understanding of the struggles many veterans have and I believe he is committed to helping them."" George, it seems like every story has sort of a little bit of an anti-Trump feel to it in the past few days.WILL: It really does. Mr. Trump in a way gives people running room do this because he is sometimes syntactically challenged as he wanders through some of his sentences. But it really is perverse to say he in some way was insulting these people just as, I must say, it's perverse to say that Hillary Clinton was disparaging young people when she said some of Bernie Sanders people are living in their parents' basements. She was saying, I think in any fair construction, that the economy is -- that we inherited from the great recession caused that to happen.BAIER: Quickly, we could see this other shoe drop with WikiLeaks, some email, and that story continues. We learn that the immunity deal included destroying Cheryl Mills' computer. That doesn't help the Clinton folks.PRZYBYLA: No. I feel like both gentlemen are correct in terms of the media pile on. And it goes both ways. A few weeks ago, we were all on the Clinton Foundation story. And all it takes is one major blockbuster headline like that for the flow to then go in reverse and for Hillary Clinton to be kind of back on her heels again. We don't know what's in this WikiLeaks bombshell being promised tomorrow. I'm sure we're all waiting with baited breath. I just don't think we can make that prediction based on what we have seen so far. I kind of feel like the Russians, if they are behind this, would have tried to get the worst stuff out there a week or two ago. But we just have to wait and see what it is.BAIER: It could be a jump ball to deal with on debate tomorrow. Last word on this.HURT: I have been amazed in the last couple of weeks the degree to which this e-mail scandal, given the fact everybody already knew basically a lot of the larger contours of the story, how much it has actually hurt her. And I think it has contributed a lot to that and the fact that Donald Trump had a good run there of making fewer mistakes than usual. So I have been surprised. So no telling what could -- if there is something blockbuster, I think we will see it reflected down the road.BAIER: And the honest and trustworthy numbers obviously are interesting.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

1	1	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/05/02/sexism-and-gender-politics/	 Sexism and gender politics	"This is a RUSH transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" April 29, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: ""Personal Story"" segment tonight. As we've been reporting, Hillary Clinton believes that Donald Trump is a sexist. Mr. Trump believes Mrs. Clinton is incompetent, corrupt, and would not even be in the presidential arena if she weren't a woman. That sets up a big gender politics situation.Joining us now from Washington to discuss it Kirsten Powers. So, how do you see this?KIRSTEN POWERS, FOX NEWS ANALYST: Okay. So, I think that in terms of saying that Hillary Clinton has played the woman card, I think that's a true statement in the sense that she has made an overt, you know, plea to people saying, we need to have a woman in the White House. She says this distinguishes her.But I don't think it's something Trump should be saying, and I also don't think he is right that she would not be successful candidate if she -- if she weren't a woman. If she was a man. And so I don't even know why he said that.O'REILLY: Hillary Clinton, were just like Madeleine Albright, for example, or a Condoleezza Rice, secretary of state without a husband who was a former president, do you really believe with all of the stuff on Hillary Clinton's resume that she would be a presidential contender?POWERS: Yes, why not? I mean, how is she any less impressive than Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio?O'REILLY: Not talking about her being impressed. I mean, you can, it's basically she has been under fire for 30 years.POWERS: Well --O'REILLY: You know, and maybe some of it is unfair. Possibly it is.POWERS: Yes.O'REILLY: But, if she didn't have the Clinton name, I'm not sure --POWERS: But she wouldn't be under fire if she didn't have the Clinton name.O'REILLY: But she's done some of the things that have brought the fire on her.POWERS: But a lot of it is stuff that happened because she was Bill Clinton's wife. And so, I mean, there's two different ways to look at it as a thought experiments. I mean, there is one if she had never married Bill Clinton and I would say that we could ask would Bill Clinton had been president if he hadn't married her. And I think that she would have done very well. She was very, you know --O'REILLY: Very smart woman. There is no doubt she is a smart woman and then she wants to serve her country.POWERS: Right.O'REILLY: Okay. I mean, that's for the audience to decide. Now, you made an interesting statement, you don't think Trump should say that she wouldn't be considered. That's his opinion. Why --POWERS: I mean, he can say it if he wants. I don't agree with it. And I don't think it helps him.O'REILLY: Yes. Okay. But he has the right to state that without being labeled a sexist, doesn't he?POWERS: Well, I mean, I think that he shouldn't be surprised when he is labeled a sexist.O'REILLY: Why? I don't understand what this whole labeling business is about.POWERS: Because I think women are tired of hearing from people about how, you know, they are somehow advantaged by being a woman. And most women did not feel that they have been advantaged in the work place by being a woman. And so, I think that is something that will rub a lot of women the wrong way.O'REILLY: All right. So, let me understand. So, the message to women is, because there is a history of women having a harder time in the marketplace than men, if you reference anything about a woman's abilities you are a sexist?POWERS: No, it's not about her abilities. It's saying basically you are getting an advantage because you are a woman.O'REILLY: Yes. Because he ran her abilities down and he says she is not qualified.POWERS: And I think that, look, I'm not saying that she is using it and she is using it to her advantage. I'm just trying to explain the psychology behind it. I mean, I wrote a column today.O'REILLY: You sounded like you were personally offended when Trump said that.POWERS: I disagree with him. I wasn't offended because if disagree with him.O'REILLY: Well, because you are a Democrat and you feel that Hillary Clinton is qualified, right?POWERS: I don't think being a Democrat has anything to do with it. I think there are plenty of people who think she is qualified but she may not be the person for them but, you know, I think most will recognize that she is an accomplished woman.O'REILLY: All right. Look, I got to get this on the record. So you are offended by Trump's description of Mrs. Clinton not being job ready? Not because he said anything about her being a female.POWERS: Yes. First of all, I'm not offended. I don't agree with it.O'REILLY: All right.POWERS: And I think that -- I just don't agree with the statement that Hillary -- I think Hillary Clinton on her own, without Bill Clinton is extremely impressive person and could easily have risen to the place that she is today on her own, not.O'REILLY: Do you understand now?POWERS: Not as a woman. As a man.O'REILLY: Do you understand that now sexism and racism and all of this stuff is being used to punish anybody by some who disagree. Bill, I wrote a whole book about it. I mean, this is a tactic that is used definitely, mostly by people on the Left. Sometimes people on the Right have done it to silence people. If they say something that you disagree with, then you call them a sexist.POWERS: That's right. And you call them a sexist.O'REILLY: That's right. You did write about it?POWERS: That said, it doesn't mean that people do sexist things or racist things.O'REILLY: Sure.POWERS: They get called out for it.O'REILLY: You know what, when they do it, nobody believes it anymore because this stuff is thrown around so irresponsibly.POWERS: Yes. It's been over a year, for sure.O'REILLY: Give your book a plug. Because I'm sure --POWERS: It's called ""The Silencing.""O'REILLY: ""The Silencing"" by Kirsten Powers, everyone.POWERS: Yes.O'REILLY: All right.

3	3	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/07/08/politics-police-shootings/	The politics of police shootings	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" July 8, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: There has been a vicious, calculated, and despicable attack on law enforcement.DALLAS POLICE CHIEF DAVID BROWN: The suspect said he was upset about Black Lives Matter. He said he was upset about the recent police shootings. The suspect said he was upset at white people. The suspect stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Five of them, police officers, dead in Dallas, 12 shot. The investigation continues, but the sole suspect was killed according to police.Let's bring in our panel and start there: Charles Hurt, political columnist for The Washington Times; Julie Pace, White House correspondent for the Associated Press; welcome April Ryan, White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Charles, your thoughts?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I'm certain, when you heard that press conference, you heard the president, I mean, across the political spectrum, there's a tone of soberness and lack of partisanship and malice in this event that I think is quite remarkable. And when you think about it, I think it has to do with the juxtaposition of these events.The cops in Dallas were protecting the march of people who were protesting police brutality. That in and of itself is ironic and speaks well of both sides. They end up rushing towards danger in a heroic way a few days after an event and where police acted, at the best, recklessly, and, obviously, fatally.So I think it shows that we are so intertwined an as a nation that we are not sort of dividing into the usual camps. I don't know how long this will last, but you get a sense that people are not going to use this. I hope, you know, you'll have some people argue with me for gun control or for whatever. But I think that is happening in this series of events much less than in others. It's almost like what happened in the Charleston shooting at Mother Emanuel church. The act of forgiveness, that remarkable redemptive act by the members of the church and the family I thought had a profound effect on the country in kind of bringing a reconciliation. That, I think, is a good thing to see.BAIER: Obviously, the president, the attorney general both mentioned concern about guns, April, in their statements last night and today. Your thoughts on Senator Tim Scott and his reflections on all of this?APRIL RYAN, AMERICAN URBAN RADIO: I really -- on the human side, I can relate to it, as an African-American, as an African-American woman, who has been profiled and stopped by police, particularly when he talked about Mother Emanuel Church and what happened with Dylan Roof. That stemmed from racism. That stemmed from the other side of the coin who did not like the fact that people were talking about what happened to Walter Scott or in Charleston, South Carolina, or talking about Eric Garner who could said ""I cannot breathe"" 11 times and died on the scene, or talking about Freddie Gray who was arrested without cause, basically, and died in police custody.You know, there is a frustration in the black community. And it's not something that -- and I'm not even trying to liken my comments to what the suspect or the dead shooter said, but there is a frustration in this country, and it's been a frustration since the time Africans were enslaved in this country. This is not new. What's new is the visual and the fact that we've been talking as African-Americans for years about this within the community. Now you see our truth. And that's the problem.BAIER: But there are people, April, who say, you look at these two shootings in Louisiana and Minnesota, and horrific, but they say, how can you get to the motivation being racial this quickly?RYAN: Let me say this. There is a truth, again, going back to truth and facts. President Obama spoke of it as soon as he landed in Warsaw, Poland. He said, last year alone -- well, yes, last year alone, blacks were two times more likely to be shot by police than white people. This is such a real situation. ""The Washington Post"" is tracking the numbers of those shot by police in this country this year. So it is a real situation. It's a very real situation. We can't walk away from it. Hillary Clinton is talking about a conversation. And if we have a conversation, it can't just be black people talking to themselves. It has to be everyone.BAIER: What about, Julie, how this administration, this president is dealing with this and his messaging?JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: I think Tim Scott put it perfectly. This is a no-win situation, an incredibly difficult situation, always made more difficult when you're overseas, as president. You have the time difference. You have the physical difference. It does sound like the White House is at least considering having the president come barrack from Europe early. He's supposed to go to Spain later this weekend.Look, I think that the president in all of these conversations is going to mention gun control. I think he firmly believes that in all of these situations, we can't ignore it. So people will be angry about that, certainly, but that is just no surprise to me, to April, she's covered it for a long time. This is something he believes in passionately and I don't think you should expect him to walk away from that.RYAN: But gun control does not mean taking guns away. It means putting the assault weapons ban back in place.BAIER: All right, we're going to talk about guns to the second panel. But I want to get to the politics here in 2016. Just moments ago, both candidates reacted to these shootings. Let's take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DONALD TRUMP, PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: They're not just police officers. They're mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, sons and daughters. And they're all on my mind today. They're on everybody's mind. A brutal attack in our police force is an attack on our country and an attack on our families.HILLARY CLINTON, PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: This is the kind of call to action, and as president I would implement a very comprehensive set of proposals that I've been making for more than a year, including, we must do more to have national guidelines about the use of force by police, especially deadly force. We need to do more to look into implicit bias. And we need to do more to respect and protect our police.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BAIER: You know, as Charles has talked about, there's a lot of talk, broadly, Charles, or Charlie, about how to deal with this but there is an election going on. How does this play one side or another as you're listening to both candidates?CHARLES HURT, THE WASHINGTON TIMES: Well, I think that, you know, I thought that both sides are going to obviously make our politics out of this. Whether it's advancing gun control or trying to stir up the deep discontent in the black community. It's just a reality of the case.But I think Donald Trump is right about one thing. Racial tensions in this country today are far, far worse than they were eight years ago. And that is a -- we elected a president who for whatever you thought about him, he had a greater credibility as a half-black, half-white person to heal the wounds in this country that have dogged us for centuries. And he failed. He's failed miserably. And I think that the answer, the answer to that is very, very complicated. It's not a simple thing. And it's not simply gun control or bad cops. It's something far more difficult. And none of these politicians at the federal level are willing to have those open, serious conversations.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
