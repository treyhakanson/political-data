Greg Abbott lays out plans to ban sanctuary cities	"This is a rush transcript from ""Your World,"" October 30, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.NEIL CAVUTO, HOST:  All right, a number of states have tried to ban sanctuary cities.  Easier said than done.  Usually, courts step in, judges step in.  North Carolina the latest to ban these sanctuary cities that protect illegals and do little to serve them up to the law.  Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott not a fan of such sanctuaries, wants Texas to go the same route.  Governor, very good to have you.  Thank you for coming.  GOV. GREG ABBOTT, R-TEXAS:  Thank you, Neil.  CAVUTO:  These are difficult, I guess, sir, to hold up in court, or at least they get stymied in legal challenges.  How do you think this is going to go?ABBOTT:  Neil, I think, under the United States Supreme Court decision in Arizona case, they were perfectly clear that states have the authority to ensure the safety and security of our citizens.And so I think that banning sanctuary cities should be upheld in court.  And Texas is going to be one of the states that passes a law that outlaws sanctuary cities, because it`s fundamental that law enforcement officers in this state must follow and apply the Constitution and the laws of the United States and of the state of Texas.  CAVUTO:  You know, the one thing I have never understood about the whole concept of sanctuary cities is they flagrantly violate, to your point, Governor, the law, and they shield people who are here illegally without a law to support what they`re doing.  So, it`s weird.  But how did it grow so out of control?  ABBOTT:  Well, it`s been one of those things that has grown just a little bit at a time, kind of like what you would call a creep.  And what has happened here is now the Dallas County sheriff has said that see is going to apply Immigration Custom Enforcement standards on a case- by-case basis.  Now, just this past week, we have heard from San Antonio that the San Antonio Police Department may formally enact sanctuary city policies.  So the state of Texas is going to be able to trump these local decision- making processes with a state law that completely bans sanctuary cities.  CAVUTO:  I would be remiss in the middle of this not to get into a little bit of politics, if you don`t mind, sir.  You have heard this back and forth between two of your party luminaries, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, over missed votes in the Senate and who`s who.  Now we got word today that Jeb Bush`s COO, campaign COO, has opted out, that his campaign might be floundering.  What do you think of all this stuff that is going on?  ABBOTT:  You know, Neil, I compare it to what happened four years ago.  If you recall, four years ago, at about this time, Herman Cain was at the top of the heap.CAVUTO:  Yes, indeed.ABBOTT:  And then it was Newt Gingrich.  And then Rick Santorum came out of nowhere to win Iowa.  I think that we`re still early in the presidential process.  I think it is good and healthy to have so many candidates involved in the debate.  And I think what is going to happen is that by the time we reach our nominee in the Republican Party, we are going to have a candidate who is polished, who is honed, who is ready to take on and defeat Hillary Clinton.  CAVUTO:  Now, of course, one of your predecessors is George Bush, and I`m wondering how that is all playing out in Texas right now.  ABBOTT:  Well, and Texas has had so many people who are involved in this race.  CAVUTO:  Right.  ABBOTT:  Obviously, Ted Cruz, who worked with me in the attorney general`s office, is in there.  Jeb Bush is from Texas.  Rand Paul is from Texas.  Carly Fiorina is from Texas.  And so...CAVUTO:  That`s right.  That`s right.  ABBOTT:  ... the odds -- the odds favor that someone from Texas is going to be the Republican nominee.  CAVUTO:  Very good point.  I would also be remiss if I didn`t mention all the horrific weather and flooding you have been having.  What`s the latest?  This latest hurricane could have been a lot worse, but it left a lot of rain, didn`t it?  ABBOTT:  Well, it is not just that.  We did have a bout of rain that left our ground saturated because of that hurricane.  But now over the past 24 hours, we have had up to 10 inches of rain.  The same area where you had the Memorial Day floods is once again flooding.  There`s flooding across the state of Texas as we speak.  The good news is, no lives have been lost, but I do want to cast this warning to everybody across the state of Texas.  And that is, listen to your local law enforcement agencies.  If they declare to you to stay out of harm`s way, remember, turn around, don`t drown.  CAVUTO:  Very good point.  People tend to be cavalier when they just see, oh, it`s just rain.  I don`t have to worry.  Thank you, Governor.  Appreciate it.  ABBOTT:  Thank you, Neil.  CAVUTO:  All right.  ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: ""Impact Segment"" tonight, our final segment with Leon Panetta, author of the new book ""Worthy Fights"" just out today.So I need a very direct answer on this, all right?LEON PANETTA: Of course.O'REILLY: Who is the better leader, Bill Clinton or Barack Obama?LEON PANETTA: They are both bright. They are both able. They both want to do what's right for the country. I think the difference is that Bill Clinton likes politics, likes the engagement in politics. Barack Obama does not like that process of engaging in politics and I think that hurts this president.O'REILLY: how does it hurt it? If he doesn't like the political spectrum and dealing with Congress and other things with foreign leaders --LEON PANETTA: It hurts him in terms of getting things done. You have a stalemate in Washington to begin with where there's such partisanship and division that's going on in the congress. And then, you know, if the President doesn't engage with them, then you have a situation where everybody gives up and they have basically given up on things. They have given up on the budget deal. They've given up on immigration reform.O'REILLY: They've given up.LEON PANETTA: They have given up on issues like infrastructure funding, on trade, on energy. I mean that is what concerns me, because I think this country cannot stand another two-and-a-half years of stalemate.O'REILLY: Which you're going to have and if the President loses the senate, which he very well may, you're going to have a real lame duck situation.Now Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State while you were Secretary of Defense -- right.LEON PANETTA: That's right.O'REILLY: And you know here very well. You were chief of staff and she was running the country, right? When you were chief of staff for Bill Clinton, was it?LEON PANETTA: She was very involved.O'REILLY: Very involved. But she wasn't so involved in the State Department because you've got cable after cable saying the security in Libya was bad and she didn't really do anything about it. Is that unfair?LEON PANETTA: I think it's unfair because if I know Hillary Clinton, if she knew that there was a security problem in Benghazi, she would have done something about it.O'REILLY: Then why didn't she know if the cables exist telling the State Department, look, we need more people here. The British have been attacked there.LEON PANETTA: You know what Bill -- I don't know that bureaucracy. I know the Defense Department. I don't know what happened at the State Department, but I know one thing. If she had known that that -- that there was a problem there in Benghazi, she would have done something about it.O'REILLY: Shouldn't she have fired the people who didn't tell her because nobody got sacked except the whistleblowers that said, hey we asked and we didn't get.LEON PANETTA: I mean I would have been concerned about not receiving that information if, in fact, it was out there.O'REILLY: Ok. Now, when you think back about how the country has changed in the six years since Barack Obama has been president, I am worried about this country.LEON PANETTA: Me too. Me too.O'REILLY: And what is your primary concern?LEON PANETTA: Look, I'm the son of Italian immigrants and my parents believed deeply in the American dream. And my father used to tell me the reason he came to this country is because my mother and he believed they could give their children a better life. I'm worried about whether or not our children are going to have a chance at a better life.You have this tremendous dysfunction in Washington. You've got a number of threats that we're confronting abroad. We're dealing with a situation where I think this country can go one of two directions. We can either be a great country -- an America in renaissance or we could be an America in decline.O'REILLY: We are in decline now. Would that be a fair statement?LEON PANETTA: I think right now --O'REILLY: We are in decline.LEON PANETTA: -- we govern either by leadership or crisis. And today we are largely governing by crisis.O'REILLY: Look, when you say, when President Obama says and you agree with him here, that arming Syrian rebels who we don't even know much about is going to blunt the ISIS fanatics. Guys like me say that's just bull. That's not going to happen. You can make a little plan or whatever, but what's going to have to happen is there's going to have to be a sophisticated fighting force on the ground against these animals. That's what's going to have to happen.President Obama doesn't have the heart or the will to do it. The next president may. But you're not going to defeat them by training Syrian rebels in Saudi Arabia and giving them a few weapons. That's not going to work and you know it's not going to work.LEON PANETTA: You're dealing with a very dangerous and fanatical enemy in Syria. And frankly it's not going to work just to do air attacks without having troops on the ground who know where the targets are and what's going on. Now, if we have People that we can trust on the ground, that's fine. But if the military thinks that we ought to have Special Forces, boots on the ground in order to do what's right, I think the President ought to be open to that kind of --O'REILLY: Once again he's not. Once again he is not leading. No, he said he wasn't. He said it a number of times. He's not open to that. And that brings me to my last question. It's very possible Barack Obama is just not up to the job.LEON PANETTA: I don't believe -- I don't believe that, Bill.O'REILLY: You don't want to believe it.LEON PANETTA: No, because I want this president to be successful, I want this country to be successful.O'REILLY: I know.LEON PANETTA: And I think deep down, you know, he knows what needs to be done. What he's got to do is develop the will to fight, to get into the ring --O'REILLY: He better get on it.LEON PANETTA: In order to make it happen.O'REILLY: He better get on it.LEON PANETTA: I agree with you.O'REILLY: All right. Leon Panetta, thanks for taking the fire here.LEON PANETTA: Ok, Bill.O'REILLY: The highlight of your week, wasn't it?LEON PANETTA: Yes. And I'm heading back to California.O'REILLY: I know. I have known Mr. Panetta, Secretary Panetta for a long time. And he is -- you're just an honest man and a great public servant and I want everybody to know that.LEON PANETTA: Thanks. I appreciate that.O'REILLY: Thanks for coming in.PANETTA: Thanks Bill.Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2012 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
