This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Breaking tonight, with a little more than 60 days to go before America elects its next president, Republican Donald Trump has again touched off a huge fight over immigration in the 2016 campaign.Welcome to THE KELLY FILE Special: Battle at the Border. I'm Shannon Bream in for Megyn Kelly. In recent days, we've witnessed a series of headlines involving Mr. Trump and what appear to be changes in his position on how to deal with the illegal immigrants. It all culminated in a whirlwind day that saw the nominee travel to Mexico City to meet with the Mexican president. Followed by a major speech in the border state of Arizona, where Mr. Trump laid out his vision for immigration reform. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R, PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Number one, are you ready? We will build a great wall along the Southern border. Number two, we are going to end catch and release. Number three, zero tolerance for criminal aliens. Zero. Number four, block funding for sanctuary cities. Number five, cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws.Number six, we are going to suspend the issuance of visas to anyplace where adequate screening cannot occur. Number seven, we will ensure that other countries take their people back when we order them deported. Number eight, we will finally complete the biometric entry exit visa tracking system. Number nine, we will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet. Number ten, we will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers.(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: But will his plan actually work, and what does this border battle mean for the presidential race? We have a powerful lineup including Chris Stirewalt and Guy Benson on the political fallout. America's toughest sheriff, Joe Arpaio, on what it means for enforcing our laws. Jose Antonio Vargas is an activist tracking this issue within the Hispanic community.Plus, Mary Ann Mendoza is with us. She saw her police officer son killed by an illegal immigrant. And Howie Kurtz has an eye opening look at how the media are covering this issue.But we begin with Trace Gallagher reporting from our West Coast Newsroom. Hey, Trace.TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Shannon. Despite the Trump campaign recently saying that some immigration policies were, quote, ""Too be determined and Trump himself saying that he was open to softening his stance on immigration, Trump's ten-point plan you just saw very much appears to alleviate any mixed messages."" In fact, in point one, again, Trump reinforces what he's been saying for 14 months. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: On day one, we will begin working on an impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful, southern border wall.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: So point by point, Trump made it clear there would be no presidential pivot. He laid out his plan to end catch and release, double down on zero tolerance for criminal aliens, and vowed to withhold federal taxes from sanctuary cities. And the more Trump reinforced his previous positions, the more some of his ardent supporters cheered. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RICH LOWRY, EDITOR, NATIONAL REVIEW: And Trump says, we're going to enforce the laws, reduce the population of illegal immigrants, and then we'll talk about the remaining illegal population down the road. That's absolutely a correct position and that's the entire Republican Party including immigration sparrows are going to rally around that position. I think it's great.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: But some Latino supporters say as early as this week during a conference call, Trump told faith leaders they could expect to see a more compassionate Trump. Now they feel betrayed. The executive vice president of the National Hispanic Leadership Conference says, quote, ""There's several of us who have gone out on a limb, if you will, to try to at least be at the table of reason with him, and that's left us confused and disappointed.""And the president of the Latino Partnership for conservative principles said, quoting again, ""At this point, I don't see how I can support him. So, I'm withdrawing my support."" And a USA Today/Suffolk poll certainly doesn't bode well for Trump going forward with minorities. It shows Donald Trump is supported by just four percent of blacks and about a quarter of Hispanics. Additionally, 80 percent of African-Americans view Donald Trump as racist. Sixty percent of Hispanics agree -- Shannon.BREAM: Tough numbers to fight against, Trace. Thank you. So what will it mean for the general election?Chris Stirewalt, our FOX News digital politics editor and Guy Benson, Townhall.com political editor and a FOX News contributor. Gentlemen, welcome to you both. Good to see you.All right. Chris, I'll start with you. Those polling numbers are bad for anybody. I mean you're up against those poll numbers, and you got 60-some days left, that's a heavy lift.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, look, here's a way to look at it. Donald Trump is doing about as well with Hispanic voters as Mitt Romney and John McCain did, which is not good, but it's not that much worse. Republicans who were already in extremis when it comes to the largest growing, fastest growing demographic group in the U.S. electorate. So it's not like he's doing worse there. And so that's maybe not so bad. I'm sure he would have liked to be doing better with black voters. I'm sure that he has these concerns.The question for Trump and the whole point about all this immigration pivot, not pivot, all this razzmatazz is, can he find a way to get more Americans, more white Americans really, to come to his side because a lot of them are put off by his point of view on immigration? When we look at what support was for his previous position, which was the deportation force -- mass deportations, that was a non-starter. The wall is not popular with voters overall. So he has problems even within the Republican Party. At some point he has to be able to get beyond this issue and start talking to voters other than those in his base.BREAM: Yes, and to that point, Guy, we also have FOX News polling that shows, you know, if he were to soften his issues on illegal immigration, 48 percent say that would actually make them more likely to vote for him. Fifteen percent say less likely. So, it sounds like he has his people locked in that are going to be with him and want him to be the hard core. But a chance he could pick up some other people, which he definitely needs them if he's going to pull this off.GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: And that's what's so confusing sometimes, Shannon. When you're trying to analyze Trump's rhetoric and positions, it's unclear which Trump and issue set we're necessarily talking about. Are we talking about Wednesday night's Donald Trump and the speech that he gave, which was laced with sort of red meat, hawkish rhetoric that led to a number of resignations from his Latino advisory board?Or are we talking about Thursday morning's Donald Trump, who told Laura Ingraham there's going to be quite a bit of softening, and who has actually softened legitimately on substance insofar as he has shifted his focus from mass deportations to immigrants who have committed additional crimes, illegal immigrants, felons, for example. Right. So it's sometimes hard for us to keep track of which Trump we're talking about when it comes to the general election and the general electorate and what people are hearing. There's some discordant messaging.BREAM: Uh-hm. And Chris, it seems like of these members who have either quit or are threatening to quit, this Hispanic Advisory Council or board that he had, it sounds like they may have been getting different messages because you remember a couple weeks ago in that meeting --STIREWALT: Right.BREAM: You know, people came out of there and said, hey, there may be some path. There maybe -- they didn't want to use the amnesty word, but they said there's definitely a difference, and then when they heard that speech Wednesday night, not the same guy. I don't even recognize him from the meeting we had.STIREWALT: It took him too long to get to -- what Guy just referenced; it took him too long to get to what has been the standard Republican policy on this question really dating back to about 2007, which is enforcement first. Now, Trump has more enforcement, and he talks about it in more lavish fashion. But enforcement first and then deal with the question of those who remain. That's been the Republican position for a long time. It shouldn't take two weeks to get to that position.And moreover, he should stop talking about dad gum immigration. It is not the most important issue by a long shot for most Americans, and for those Americans who are hawkish on immigration, who really care about that issue at the top of the stack, they're already voting for Donald Trump. He's already got their support. He has to get off of this issue and start talking about pocketbook issues and things that suburban voters really care about, or he's not going to be able to execute a pivot into viability.BREAM: Uh-hm. And, Guy, quickly as we're almost out of time, this was a big selling point for him and something that differentiated him or at least he tried to use it as something that differentiated him from the other 16 Republicans who were running. So the people who signed on to him because of this issue, for them, it may be the number one issue.BENSON: Yes. Although as you pointed out in our FOX News polling, his supporters, Trump's base is the group that is most likely to forgive a so- called softening. They say a plurality that they would be more likely to vote for him with very few saying that they would waver in their support. So he's got his base locked down. The pivot that he's talked about, the softening that he's paid lip service to, that would be directed at other voters, and yet the tone at least on Wednesday night seemed like coming back for a similar play to the base that he already has from the primary.BREAM: Uh-hm. All right. Guy, Chris, great to see you both.BENSON: Thank you.STIREWALT: You bet.BREAM: The battle at the border took a dramatic turn last week when news broke that Donald Trump would make an unexpected trip to Mexico to visit that country's president. While the meeting was widely regarded as stately, presidential, even dignified, it did not change the messaging from either the Clinton or Trump campaigns.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D, PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: You don't build a coalition by insulting our friends or acting like a loose cannon. You do it by putting in the slow, hard work of building relationships. And it certainly takes more than trying to make up for a year of insults and insinuations by dropping in on our neighbors for a few hours and then flying home again. That is not how it works.TRUMP: Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement. The result will be millions more illegal immigrants, thousands of more violent, horrible crimes, and total chaos and lawlessness.(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: Joining me now, David Wohl, attorney and Donald Trump supporter. And Richard Fowler, nationally syndicated radio talk show host. Great to see you, gentlemen.RICHARD FOWLER, SYNDICATED RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Good to be here.DAVID WOHL, ATTORNEY: Hi, Shannon.BREAM: All right. Richard, he's getting credit, even from people who don't like him who said, listen, it looked presidential. He was standing there on the stage with another world leader, and he pulled it off.FOWLER: Indeed. And here's the thing, Shannon. It did look presidential. I won't discount that. But the speech that he gave a couple hours after was the opposite of presidential. At the beginning of the segment, Trace talked about the number -- how deplorable his numbers are amongst Hispanics. Sixty percent of them find him to be racist or bigoted. Now, let's put this into context and talk about this from a presidential election per se. The last time a Republican won the White House was George W. Bush in 2004. He won 40 percent of Latinos.Donald Trump is nowhere near that number. He's almost 20 points down to where George W. Bush was in 2004. That makes the White House almost unwinnable, all because he continues to push forward this really, really bad immigration policy. He's learned nothing from John McCain or Mitt Romney. Self-deportation doesn't work. Building a wall doesn't work. We need a clear, clean, pathway to citizenship, and he could continue what Obama is doing. Obama is called the deporter-in-chief. So deport the bad ones and find a pathway to citizenship for the good ones. Pretty simple.BREAM: All right. David, he did put out ten points in that speech on Wednesday. I'm guessing Richard disliked at least maybe nine of them.WOHL: Right.BREAM: But he's right about the numbers. I mean how does Trump turn that around? How does he convince people? You know, he talked about minorities in that speech and said that they are the ones -- the ones who are here legally in the U.S., they're being hurt by illegal immigration. Is that going to be enough to convince these, you know, different groups that he needs to win over that he's our guy?WOHL: Well, Shannon, we have to talk about choices. It's Mr. Trump versus four more years of Mr. Obama. I mean the diplomatic meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Pena Nieto in Mexico sent shock waves across America. In case you had any doubt, Donald Trump is the real deal. Donald Trump has gravitas. He accomplished what -- in that short meeting, mending fences more so than has been done in the last four years. Now, meanwhile, Hillary Rodham Clinton was in the Hamptons hob knobbing with wealthy elitists, raising millions of dollars and promising who knows what.That is her history. But the reality is the immigration plan put forth by Mr. Trump puts America first, puts the best interest of America first and not just white Americans, Asian-Americans, Black Americans, but Latino Americans as well. And Latino-Americans are the ones that will go to the polls and vote. That the illegal immigrants are not going to be able to vote. Latino-Americans care about their best interests, care about jobs, care about health care, care about keeping us safe from terrorism. So when you get down, and Donald Trump is going to focus on this issue more and crystallize it in the coming weeks.BREAM: Yes. Richard is not buying it.(CROSSTALK)But, Richard, let's talk about the optics of that because there are, you know, these folks that are saying, all in all it was a good day for him. The speech, visit all of that kind of stuff and as David points out, you know, Hillary Clinton has been sort of missing in action. It's been more than 270 days since she's held a press conference, and she was at fund- raisers where some of the people to get in, it was $250,000. Average Americans cannot relate to that.FOWLER: Here's the thing. I mean we could play this game with Hillary Clinton all we want and talk about what she isn't doing or not doing, but Donald Trump's candidacy is so abysmal that you don't even have to talk about Hillary Clinton. You can just talk about all the missteps that Donald Trump has made. His ten-point immigration plan is not workable. Number one, it explodes the deficit. It's going to explode the deficit to build this wall.BREAM: How is that? How is that? Because he says we're going to save money but we're spending it on illegal immigration and be able to re-route that money to things for people who are here legally.FOWLER: I'll tell you how we get there. Building this wall would cost trillions of dollars.(CROSSTALK)BREAM: Oh, he said, Mexico is going to pay for it.FOWLER: Mexico has clearly said, they're not going to pay for it.BREAM: Yes. They disagree with that.FOWLER: And not to mention the fact that he said he wants to quadruple -- he wants to triple, excuse me, was the word he used, ICE border agents. That's going to cost more money. So, for all the deficit hawks out there, Donald Trump will explode the deficit. And number two --(CROSSTALK)BREAM: Well, he says in his plan there, he's going to pay for it by cleaning up what we're spending on illegal immigration every year. We got to leave it there. I know we could continue this. Maybe we'll do it on pay-per-view. Maybe we'll continue on pay-per-view. All right? I like that idea. David and Richard, great to see you both.All right. We also have new fallout tonight from Trump's ten-point immigration plan. Does it mean the Republican nominee is taking back his early promise to deport illegal immigrants? The director of the Center for Immigration Studies joins us, next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I call it extreme vetting. I call it extreme, extreme vetting. Our country has enough problems.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM: When Donald Trump last week laid out his tough ten-point plan on immigration, some supporters cheered him for holding the line while others were openly wondering what happened to his recent promise to ease up? Watch a little bit of what's played out over the last week or so.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: There certainly can be a softening because we're not looking to hurt people. We want people -- we have some great people in this country.There will be no amnesty. Our message to the world will be this. You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country.Oh, there's softening. Look, we do it in a very humane way, and we're going to see with the people that are in the country. Obviously I want to get the gang members out, the drug peddlers out, I want to get the drug dealers out. Then we're going to make a decision at a later date once everything is stabilized. I think you're going to see there's really quite a bit of softening.(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: Joining me now, executive director at the Center for Immigration Studies, Mark Krikorian. Thanks for being with us tonight.MARK KRIKORIAN, EXEC. DIR., CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES: Glad to be here.BREAM: All right. What do you make of the different variations, the nuances of what we've seen on Mr. Trump's positions? Are you confident that he's landed somewhere that you're comfortable with and you think it sticks?KRIKORIAN: I'm not sure nuances is really the right word for anything that Donald Trump comes up with. But what -- I think the speech that he gave in Phoenix on immigration, really what it did is return to the original immigration plan that he put up on his website something like a year ago, which did not have this talk of deporting all 12 million illegal immigrants in a short period of time. He made that up on his own just off the top of his head. So it's not so much, I think, a softening really or a pivot or whatever word they're using for it.It's really more going from a kind of amorphous level, a gut reaction that he was giving, you know, at these big rallies to a more thought out, organized, in this case ten-point immigration plan that has a lot of detail to it that's motivated by the same concerns. In other words, the goal to restore control over immigration, but as a real-world thing, not this sort of gut reaction he had about deporting all the illegals, which no immigration restrictionist has ever actually proposed before.BREAM: Well, why do you think he continues to get tarred and feathered as it were with that? The people who oppose him as critics and objects say he's going to round everybody up. What we actually heard from the Hillary Clinton was he's going to break up families and, you know, in their view, he's still moving forward on that path based, you know, on what he said Wednesday night.KRIKORIAN: Yes. They said all of that for, you know, Romney as well. You know what I mean? So in a sense, any Democratic campaign is going to say that about any Republican. If Jeb had been nominated or Marco Rubio, they would be saying the same thing. So, I'm not sure there's anything Trump could do to avoid that sort of thing. But the fact remains Trump goes out of his way to, you know, to encourage that sort of thing or at least give an excuse for it. I mean he is the one who said, you know, that we're going to have deportation force that's going to, you know, round up 11 million or 12 million people in the period of a year or two.That was frankly kind of dumb. The campaign should have cleaned that up the next day. Instead, they let it just hang out there for months, and finally they did come up with a coherent, frankly pretty, you know, organized, real-world way, a set of policies to restore control not just over the physical border with Mexico, but the whole immigration system.BREAM: Uh-hm. All right. Mark Krikorian, thanks for weighing in on this. Always good to see you.KRIKORIAN: Thank you.BREAM: Our next guest doesn't exactly see things in the same light. In fact, he has called Donald Trump a buffoon when it comes to the issue of immigration. That's not all. Javier Palomarez is the president and CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, he joins us now.All right. Javier, not a fan of the Wednesday speech?JAVIER PALOMAREZ, CEO, US HISPANIC CHAMBER OF COMMERCE: No. Not a fan of the Wednesday speech. Listen, Donald Trump continues to harp on this issue. He created this dragon in 2015 so he could slay it in 2016. It's subterfuge. The United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce collaborated with the George W. Bush Institute on a study. That look, it was a non- partisan study that looked at immigration, and it found over a five-year period of time that net migration between the United States and Mexico will-- 20,000 people over a five year period of time for nations the size of Mexico and the U.S., that's practically zero. And by the way, it was 20,000 more people leaving the United States, going to Mexico, than leaving Mexico and coming to the United States. That's the data. Those are the facts according to the George W. Bush institute.BREAM: Right. He didn't say anything about rounding up the millions of people. He did say a number of times we don't know how many people are here. We don't know how many millions. He said he wants to get rid of the bad guys, which is the same thing this administration wants to do, get people out who are, you know, serious criminal actors, that kind of thing. But you know, he gave us ten points, and none of them included rounding people up, ripping kids out of their homes, throwing them back across the border.PALOMAREZ: You know, he made it clear to me that there was no amnesty, which says that he's going to deport -- mass deport, you know, 11 million undocumented workers. In the context of Labor Day, let's look at what this would do to the American labor force. Who's going to clean those kitchens? Who's going to pluck the chickens? Who's going to pick that crop? Who's going to package that meat? Who's going to --BREAM: Can Americans not do that work?PALOMAREZ: Absolutely, and if they would, if they were willing to do it, they'd be doing it now. We wouldn't have the immigrants here doing it.BREAM: Well, you know that people on the other side of this argument say that the depressed wages and the illegal immigration from people coming in here who aren't tracked and may not be paying taxes likely aren't, when the wages are suppressed, why should they pay Americans $15 or $20 an hour to do that?PALOMAREZ: You know the reality of it is, if Americans wanted to do that work, it would be done by Americans right now. There have been opportunities for that to happen. This is an economic issue. At the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, we look at comprehensive immigration reform as an economic imperative for the continued wellbeing of this nation. There are literally millions of jobs being filled by these individuals.BREAM: Uh-hm.PALOMAREZ: If they mass deport these individuals, who's going to do that work and at what cost? And what is the downstream cost to the American people? By the way, to deport them is going to be about $400 billion, and it will take about 20 years to get it done.BREAM: Yes. And I think Mr. Trump --PALOMAREZ: Donald Trump is a threat to the American economy.BREAM: He was clear that he's got a whole lot of other priorities before he ever gets to that discussion, so we'll see. And you know the wall is number one. We'll stand by. Javier, thank you so much.PALOMAREZ: Thank you for having me.BREAM: Coming up, Donald Trump promised to beef up our Southern security. And we're going to hear from the Border Patrol Council on what that would take exactly.And then Sheriff Joe and Jose Antonio Vargas join me on the fallout from the front-lines.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We're also going to hire 5,000 more border patrol agents.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY WRIGHT, FOX NEWS AMERICA'S NEWS HEADQUARTER CO-HOST: Live from ""America's News Headquarters,"" I'm Kelly Wright, good evening. Congress returns tomorrow from its seven-week summer break. High on their agenda, the dreaded mosquito borne Zika virus. Lawmakers are at odds over how much money to fund eradication efforts.Last winter, President Obama requested nearly $2 billion, but Republicans reneged. Since then, a number of cases have sprung up in this country, most of them in Florida. The governor was to travel to D.C. tomorrow to lobby congress for money. That trip will be delayed while Florida recovers from former hurricane Hermine.Speaking of Hermine, forecasters continue to keep an eye on the storm as it churns several hundred miles off New York's Long Island. Hermine is bringing rain, riptides, and high surf to the northeast. It's responsible for three deaths in the south. That's a look at news this hour. I'm Kelly Wright. Now back to ""The Kelly File.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We're also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents. Who gave me their endorsements, 16,500 gave me their endorsement. And put more of them on the border instead of behind desks, which is good. We will expand the number of Border Patrol stations significantly.(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: That was Donald Trump during his fiery immigration speech last Wednesday night, talking about boosting manpower on the southern border and raising questions about how the agents on the front lines see this issue. Joining me now, Shawn Moran, the vice president and spokesman for the National Border Patrol Council. Sean, thank you for joining us. Your reaction to what you heard from Mr. Trump.SHAWN MORAN, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL SPOKESMAN: Well, I'm very encouraged. Finally we have a presidential candidate that's actually talking about border security and not just reforming the immigration system and giving amnesty within the first 100 days.BREAM: So, he talked last night about hiring a lot more Border Patrol agents. Would that help you? Do policies need to change? What would be a real world difference for you and the men and women on the front lines?MORAN: Well, it's really hard to say because right now we're down over 1,500 agents, and the Obama administration has refused to fill those positions so obviously we need the manpower, but what I think we need most is a good policy that allows us to go out and do our jobs.I don't know what the number of Border Patrol agents it's going to take to secure the border because we've never been allowed to do the job. I think the last Border Patrol agents that were actually allowed to secure the border have been retired for about two decades.BREAM: How tough is it for you and the men and women who are working out there because, you know, we do stories all the time about Border Patrol agents who get in trouble who try to do the jobs they say that they think they were hired to do and including, you know, in the last couple of year a lawsuit by those who said we can't even do our constitutional duty and the oath we took on the front lines every day.MORAN: It's very difficult because we're being told that border security is a priority. But you see more exceptions to the immigration laws and cutting out entire sections of the law, welcoming people here, and it creates an imbalance. You see that with the Central American children. We're not taking that threat seriously, and we're on pace to exceed the numbers we saw in 2014, which were an all-time high because the problem hasn't been dealt with, and it's been over three years now.BREAM: Yeah, and that creates a humanitarian crisis that all of us have compassion towards people who are taking very risky paths and flights to try to get here. But, again, without the magnet drawing them here, you have to question whether so many would be willing to take those risks. Shawn Moran, thank you very much for joining us.MORAN: Thank you Shannon.BREAM: Also with us tonight, Trump supporter and Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio along with Jose Antonio Vargas. He is the editor of Emerging U.S. and founder of DefineAmerican.com. Great to see you both. Sheriff, I'll start with you. Mr. Trump made a lot of promises there, but you heard one of our guest earlier say, who's going to pay for it?JOE ARPAIO, MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF: Well, you know, why are we worrying about pay, about money, when we are being flooded with drugs from Mexico and illegal immigrants, crime? So I don't understand the money issue. That really should not be an issue. The issue should be to do something about the problem.At least Donald Trump has a great plan, 10-point plan, which by the way, is a no-brainer when you really look at every item he's talking about. But there's one thing that's missing, and it's sort of a personal thing with me because I was the director in Mexico City, head of the federal drug enforcement and also the border. I can go on and on. Turkey.You have to stop this problem in the foreign country. You have to stop it in Mexico. You have to crack down in Mexico on the drugs and illegal immigration. Now, we talk about the Border Patrol. I would love to see the Border Patrol go across that border bilaterally, work with the Mexican authorities like I did with the Mexican army, and stop -- stop this problem. Stop the drug traffic coming across the border.Nobody talks about cracking down in Mexico, including Hillary and Obama. How many times have they ever been to Mexico to talk to the president to crack down on it? No, they don't want to insult that country. So we have to do it over there.BREAM: All right. Let's bring in Jose here. I got to ask you, do you object to what the sheriff has laid out there about some cross-border cooperation, about very real problems? I mean when Donald Trump was in Mexico and he talked with the president, they both talked about this traffic is going both ways, and it's bad for both countries.JOSE ANTONIO VARGAS, EMERGING U.S. EDITOR: By the way, there is no correlation -- there is no study that's been done correlating violence with illegal immigration, right? Undocumented people like me are not causing more violence here in the United States. There's no study that has said that.BREAM: But that there are families and that we heard -- there are families we heard from who clearly...VARGAS: Absolutely.BREAM: ...their loved ones would still be alive had the person who killed them not been in this country illegally.VARGAS: Absolutely. And my compassion and my empathy and my sadness for that, right? Criminals should be deported, absolutely. But the vast majority of the millions of undocumented people in this country are not committing any -- are not killing anybody. We're not murderers. We're not rapists. We're not here to do that. And you talked about magnet by the way.Here's one magnet. Why is it that we put a sign outside the U.S.-Mexico border that says ""Keep Out"" and then ten yards in, what do we say? ""Help Wanted,"" right. Like we are a country addicted to cheap labor. Employers in this country exploit and take advantage of undocumented workers who they pay less.BREAM: Would ah agree that one of the things that would work would be something like e-Verify, and requiring it across the board where if you're going to hire someone, you have to be accountable for their status?VARGAS: Employers -- employers, to me, are the biggest magnet for undocumented workers in this country.BREAM: So e-verify?VARGAS: And the fact that we as a country are addicted to cheap labor. By the way, I was -- as an undocumented worker, I went through e-Verify, and it didn't work.BREAM: OK.VARGAS: As an undocumented person in this country, there should be a process for us to know who's here illegally. Absolutely.BREAM: That would benefit everyone, I think.VARGAS: I came forward and said I am here illegally. We need a process. We need to figure this out.BREAM: All right, I want to give the final quick word here to the sheriff.ARPAIO: Well, you know, the wall is not just for illegal immigration. It's for the drugs destroying our nation, our young people, the heroin that's been going on for years and years. Nobody seems to be addressing that problem. It's all this illegal immigration. That's important, but don't forget where all the drugs are coming from, destroying our nation, inner city problems, I can go on and on. So let's talk about that.BREAM: We got to leave it there, but that is something that Donald Trump and the president of Mexico agreed as a big issue, bad for both countries and needs to be other addressed. Sheriff, Jose, great to see you both.ARPAIO: Thank you.VARGAS: Thank you.BREAM: Up next, family members of Americans killed by illegals gather to support Donald Trump on his immigration plan. And when we come back, we will talk with Mary Ann Mendoza, whose police officer son was killed by an illegal immigrant. We're going to ask her about what she thinks has to change.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM: Throughout the 2016 election, the issue of immigration reform has provided a platform for emotional stories of American lives lost at the hands of the illegal immigrants. One of those stories is Sarah Root, and Donald Trump has recently been making her a household name. Trace Gallagher is in our West Coast newsroom with more on Sarah's story, Trace.GALLAGHER: Shannon, it was January 31st when Iowa natives Scott and Michelle Root got a late night call saying their 21-year-old daughter, Sarah, who was celebrating her college graduation, had been involved in a car accident. When the Root's arrived at the hospital, they learned their straight-A student daughter had been struck by a street-racing drunk driver. Her spinal cord snapped, skull fractured, face swollen beyond recognition.Her parents were first to identify her by a ""Live, Laugh, and Love"" tattoo on her rib cage. Doctors put her chance of survival at zero, but the Root's kept her on life support long enough to allow her organs to be donated. Their nightmare soon became national news when the illegal immigrant driver who struck Sarah, with a blood alcohol level three times the legal limit made bail. Even though Eswin Mejia was charged with vehicular manslaughter and ordered back for screening, it didn't matter.He had fled the country. The Roots later found out he had two previous arrests for drunk driving, but did not show up to court for either of those charges. The judge who released him on bail for the death of Sarah Root wasn't informed of the earlier charges because Mejia didn't meet the quote ""enforcement priorities of immigration and customs enforcement."" Donald Trump is now highlighting Sarah's story. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into the U.S. -- think of it -- into the U.S. community under the policies of the White House, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: The Roots are now pushing Sarah's law that calls for stricter detention laws. Mejia is currently on ICE's most wanted list, Shannon.BREAM: All right. Trace, thank you very much. That story you just heard hits close to home for our next guest. In 2014, an illegal immigrant who had been living in the U.S. for two decades was driving drunk when he took the promising life of Sergeant Brandon Mendoza. Now Mendoza's mother is speaking out on immigration and putting her support behind Donald Trump.Immigration reform advocate Mary Ann Mendoza joins me now. Mary Ann, we thank you for your time. Can you tell us what it is like, first of all, to get the news that you've lost a child and to have the complicating factor that that involved somebody who shouldn't have even been here, that had -- you've been able to go back and time and that person never made it to this country or been deported along with previous criminal convictions and arrests, your son may still be here.MARY ANN MENDOZA, SON KILLED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT: Absolutely. He would be here. You know, I got a call at 3:00 in the morning from Afghanistan, from a fellow police officer who was also in the National Guard, telling me my son had been in an accident, and my world came crumbling apart from that moment on. And Brandon was a spoke in my wheel that will never be replaced. The wheel will never turn the same again in my family. But listening to some of your previous guests, I want to just say this.The Hispanic community that are Americans, I find it very hard to believe that they're offended and would call Donald Trump racist for standing up for people who are doing something illegally that Hispanic-Americans have done legally. They've taken the time to become citizens the right way, and this -- this program, this whole 10-steps that he outlined at his immigration speech is not only protecting them. It's protecting Americans, and we need to stop putting a division and saying the Hispanic people don't support him.The black people don't support him. He has little chance of making it. We are all Americans, and why is the media trying to further racially divide this country and make a point that votes from those people don't count? We are Americans, and we all need to stand up for the things that Donald Trump is doing to save every one of our lives and our children's lives and our country.BREAM: Well, your son served our country in multiple ways, and we know that you are now fighting for his legacy and carrying on, trying to spare any other family from the same grief that you have suffered. Mary Ann Mendoza, we thank you for your time and for sharing your story.MENDOZA: Thank you for having me.BREAM: Up next, Howie Kurtz on the media's reaction to Donald Trump's immigration plans and whether reporters are treating both sides the same way.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM: For days we have seen a frantic series of media stories with reporters chasing what they saw as a major shift in position from the Republican presidential nominee. As it first, well, it seemed like Donald Trump was indeed softening his stand on illegal immigration, but when we got to the big Wednesday night speech, he painted a dire picture of what could happen if the U.S. does not secure its borders. Howard Kurtz is host of ""Media Buzz"" on Fox News and joins us. Hi, Howie.HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS MEDIA BUZZ SHOW HOST: Hi, Shannon. Well, in the run up to Donald Trump's Mexican visit and that speech on immigration, there was an avalanche of media analysis on whether he was guilty of that dreaded journalistic term of flip-flop. The Trump campaign calls that coverage unfair.It sure seemed that Trump was backing away from the stance he took during the primaries that all 11 million illegal immigrants in this country would be deported and would have to be vetted before they could return. At one point, during a town hall with Sean Hannity, Trump asked the crowd's opinion and that period brought sharp criticism from the pundits.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Number one, we'll say throw out. Number two, we work with them. Ready? Number one.(Inaudible)Number two.(CHEERING)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean one of the biggest policy shifts or flip-flops or whatever you want to call it between the primary and the general election that we've ever seen.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That undermines everything he's ever said, and you have to question did he ever mean it? I think the answer is probably no.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Trump's running mate complained that the press kept harping on the subject of mass deportations.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE PENCE, REPUBLICAN VICE-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I know the media wants to focus on that one issue. Donald Trump will articulate a policy about how we deal with that population.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't understand why it's the fault of the media for focusing on an issue that you're crediting Donald Trump for bringing to the fore.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: But Trump said in Arizona that he wouldn't move against most of the11 million illegal immigrants, those who haven't committed crimes, until the rest of his plan has been carried out, which he acknowledged would take several years. So, was the press biased in saying Trump had flip-flopped? Not really.He significantly changed his position on a key part of his signature issue. Now, the media, even some of Trump's fiercest critics were far more positive about Trump's surprise visit with Mexico's president, providing a visual of him on the world stage.But many journalists slammed the red meat speech as too harsh with ""Politico"" calling Trump's entire day a farce. It's worth recalling that the press is not always consistent in applying the flip-flop label. Hillary Clinton opposed same-sex marriage in her first presidential campaign, then changed her view after president Obama did just three years ago. But that was widely described as an evolution, Shannon.BREAM: An excellent point, Howie. All right, so let's talk about this issue now of immigration and sort of the mindset. Do you feel that there is -- you can't paint everyone with the same brush, but do you feel that there's sort of a default position that many in the media have about the issue of immigration and immigration reform and that it impacts the way that they view and report these issues and events?KURTZ: I have observed that, and it's been going on for several years. It goes back to when George W. Bush was pushing immigration reform, when Marco Rubio and the Gang of Eight were pushing immigration reform during the first Obama term. The press generally defaults, at least in the underlying tone, toward thinking that's a good idea.Therefore, Shannon, a lot of journalists were horrified when Donald Trump, during the primaries, had success in selling the message of, you know, temporary ban on Muslim immigrants and all that. So now it's kind of payback time because journalists feel, well, he finally had to back off that even though he hasn't quite described it as a change in policy. That's what it is and that's why you keep hearing that term flip-flop, flip-flop.BREAM: All right, Howard Kurtz in Washington, great to see you.KURTZ: Good to see you, Shannon.BREAM: And we will be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM: It is a tough topic, but it is one worthy of conversation. No matter how difficult it may be. So we want to hear what you think. Go to facebook.com/thekellyfile. Tell us what you think about the show. Thanks for watching.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Fox News Sunday,"" June 21, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.CHRIS WALLACE, ANCHOR: I'm Chris Wallace.The massacre at a black church sparks new calls for gun control.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of violence does not happen in other advanced countries.WALLACE: We'll get the latest on a confessed shooter in a live update from Charleston, and discuss race and gun violence with our Sunday group.Then, politics and religion intersect as conservatives clash with Pope Francis over climate change.JEB BUSH (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't get economic policy from my -- from my bishops or my cardinals or from my pope.GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), NEW JERSEY: As a Catholic, I take teachings from the pope about religion and not about other issues.WALLACE: We'll discuss the pope's message on global warming and politics of his September visit to the U.S. with Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the archbishop of Washington.Plus, Rick Perry retools his image for another run at the White House.RICK PERRY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes, it's time for a reset -- time to reset the relationship between government and citizens.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: We sit down with Governor Rick Perry to talk about his presidential bid. It's a ""Fox News Sunday"" exclusive.And our Power Player of the Week, a key figure in the debate over Common Core standards.LAURA SLOVER, CEO, PARCC: As a parent, I can understand why there are concerns about testing.WALLACE: All, right now, on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: Hello again, and happy Father's Day from Fox News in Washington.On this first Sunday after the massacre at a black church, the mourning for the nine victims continues in Charleston and across the nation. The shooting has reignited old debates over race and gun control. In a few minutes we'll discuss all of that with our panel.But first, we want to bring in Rich Edson, who has the latest from Charleston -- Rich.RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Chris, worshippers are gathering here at Emanuel AME Church, as they do every Sunday for regular services, though this only four days after a gunman opens fire, killing nine in Emanuel AME Church. Since then, hundreds of thousands from those around the city and those from around country -- women, men, black, white -- have been here to pay their respects leaving cards, flowers and prayers.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LUCINDA MAGWOOD, CHARLESTON MOURNER: We're united as one. There's no divide right now. We like to say that there is divide when there is conflict. Right now, our differences are placed aside and we're united. We're one.NICOLE BEALE, CHARLESTON MOURNER: I couldn't be anywhere else on a Sunday morning but right here to let these guys know their grace in such a horrific time has shown the world and everybody that, you know, hate will not win.(END VIDEO CLIP)EDSON: And now, the focus is on the accused killer, Dylann Roof. And the FBI and the Charleston Police Department say they are looking into a Web site called ""The Last Rhodesian,"" Rhodesia, is a nod to government in the south of Africa that was a racist regime fell in 1979. But on that Web site, there were pictures posted showing Dylann Roof, photos of him burning an American flag, posing with a Confederate flag and a number of poses of him with a gun.It also includes these racists statements, concluding with him saying, no one is acting, and he has to -- Chris.WALLACE: Rich Edson, reporting from Charleston, Rich, thanks for that.We want to discuss this week's terrible events with our Sunday panel. GOP strategist Karl Rowe, Maryland Congresswoman Donna Edwards, Deneen Borelli, chief political correspondent for The Conservative Review, and former Democratic Senator Evan Bayh.There are aspects to this tragedy, the long painful history of attacks on black churches, the racist manifesto and chilling pictures and issue of gun control.Congresswoman Edwards, let me start with you. What are your thoughts about the massacre in Charleston?REP. DONNA EDWARDS (D), MARYLAND: Well, it did take me back. I remember as a little girl when the 16th Street Baptist Church was bombed in Birmingham, and I remember being afraid of going to church.WALLACE: And we should say 1963.EDWARDS: In 1963.WALLACE: And four little girls were killed in that bombing.EDWARDS: That's right. And I think for so many of us, the pain and the history of violence that's happened in our churches, it was a reminder again that we still have a lot of work to do in this country and to see those lives lost, you know, a state senator, a pastor, a librarian, a coach, people who were part of the fabric of the community.And I think all of us have work to do on race, and I don't think it's inappropriate for us to talk about what we need to do to get and keep guns out of the hands of people who would commit such a tragedy.WALLACE: There was another extraordinary scene on Friday at Dylann Roof's first court hearing. Some of the relatives of the victims directly confronted him. We want to play a clip of Nadine Collier, who is the author of 70-year-old Ethel Lance, one of the people who were shot dead. Here it is.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)NADINE COLLIER, DAUGHTER OF ETHEL LANCE: I will never talk to her ever again. I will never be able to hold her again, but I forgive you. And have mercy on your soul.(END AUDIO CLIP)WALLACE: It breaks your heart.Deneen, your thoughts about what happened in Charleston?DENEEN BORELLI, CONSERVATIVE REVIEW: It is heartbreaking. My thoughts and prayers are by those directly affected and also our country as a whole affected by this.I'm in awe of how the family members were able to come out and show forgiveness and show compassion and given what they have been up against and what they have experienced, it is amazing to me the level of the strength that these individuals have with their faith in God and I also think that their actions are rebranding the images of what the world sees of Black Americans.I don't have to remind you of what we saw in Ferguson, on the streets of Baltimore. I think what we've witnessed from what happened in Charleston, forgiveness and love and compassion these individuals have shown with this instance is help rebranding to the world that black Americans are hard working, God-fearing Americans.WALLACE: When President Obama first spoke about the shooting, he brought up the issue of gun control but he seemed to concede that there was almost no chance Congress would do something or anything about it. Then, on Friday, he pushed back against that saying that he is not giving up on that issue.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: We don't know it would have prevented what happened in Charleston. No reform can guarantee the elimination of violence but we might still have some more Americans with us. We might have stopped one shooter.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Senator Bayh, was it appropriate? Because there's some questioning of that. Was it appropriate for the president to bring up gun control just hours after the shooting? And do you agree with his initial assessment, whether he wants to give up or not, that there's no chance Congress is going to pass meaningful gun control?EVAN BAYH, FORMER U.S. SENATOR (D-IN): I don't think the president was playing politics with this, Chris. I really don't. Taken in full context of his remarks, I think he was raising the issue of how do we deal with violence and residual problems with race in our society. So, I don't think it was inappropriate.With regard to him what do we do about race and that sort of thing, I think our two panelists mentioned, I can't imagine a more powerful rebuttal to racism as in quality of the people who lost their lives and more importantly the reaction of their loved ones. It was almost unimaginable grace in the face of tragedy. And, hopefully, that will serve an important role in helping to heal some of the wounds that exist.WALLACE: Karl, whether you agree with the president on gun control or not, you certainly have to agree with him that we see these cases of mass violence way too often and we see them more often in the United States than in other advanced countries. And I mean, you know, you are in a position to say, what do we do about it whether it's government, whether it's community, whether it's family, how do we stop the violence?KARL ROVE, FORMER BUSH WHITE HOUSE ADVISER: Well, I wish I had an easy answer for that. I don't think there's any easy answer. We saw an act of evil, racist, bigoted evil. And to me, the amazing thing about this is it was met with grief and love.And think about how far we've come. 1963, the whole weight of the government throughout the South was to impede finding and holding and bringing to justice the men who perpetrated the bombing and here we saw an entire state, an entire community, an entire nation come together grieving as one, united in the belief that this was an evil act.So, we have come a long way. Now, maybe there's some magic law that will keep us from having more of these. I mean, basically, the only way to guarantee that we would dramatically reduce acts of violence involving guns is to basically remove guns from society, and until somebody gets enough oomph to repeal the Second Amendment, that's not going to happen. I don't think it's an answer.I think there were so many warning since here. A friend who knew of what was in Dylann Roof's heart, parents who didn't pay attention, a community that had given up on him, and a loner who had fallen into the clutches of racist organizations and had come to believe in their ideology and put things up on the Internet that we didn't give any credence to whatsoever.And so, there were a lot of warning signs here and I wish that some of those people had spoken up and said, here's somebody who is in trouble and a danger to himself and others.WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, I want to pick up on both things that Karl said. One of the things that struck me and, you know, you -- all of our minds, those of us who are old enough, remember '63 and remember the bombing in Birmingham and remember there wasn't universal shock and hatred. There were parts -- not that people celebrated it, but people weren't going to join in trying to find the killers.And, you know, the reaction in South Carolina this week, you know, from members of that congregation, to the white governor of the state, was just universal shock and horror and everybody gathered together to try to catch this young man in a very short amount of time.So, one, isn't that progress?And, two, you know, a lot of people knew this kid was off the track. You know, his family knew, his friends knew. Not to blame them, but how do we somehow have a circuit breaker when somebody is headed in such a wrong direction to stop him?EDWARDS: Look, I think it is true that when you look at the response from every elected official on down to law enforcement at the national level, everyone responded in exactly the right kind of way to bring this young man to the pathway toward justice.I think that, you know, the challenge for us is that if the only thing that can come out of this is that next week when Congress reconvenes that we engage in yet another moment of silence, I think that would be really unfortunate and so while we've come an awful long way whether it's on race or other issues, we can see played out in our streets whether it was Emanuel AME Church in South Carolina, streets of Baltimore, Ferguson and all of the rest that we have a lot of challenges to make sure that our communities are whole and that people have the kind of opportunity that doesn't allow us to feel that someone is taking something away in order for all of us as Americans to gain.And I -- you know, and I think while -- you know, Karl has pointed out there were a lot of warning signs. You know, tons of warning signs. The question is, what do we do with those warning signs? And what can we do systemically to make certain that even if that is present, and the crazy guy is always going to be there, and person who's, you know, gone the wrong direction is always going to be there, what can we do to keep the gun out of the hand of that person?WALLACE: All right. Thank you, panel. We'll see you all a little later in the program.Up next, Pope Francis calls for dramatic action on climate change. But some politicians in this country push back against his message. Cardinal Donald Wuerl, archbishop of Washington, joins us next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Pope Francis delivered a message for the world this week, arguing -- we're in the process of destroying our planet, and calling for dramatic changes in our politics, economy and lifestyle.Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the archbishop of Washington, has joined us to discuss the pope's message and the criticism it has received.Your Eminence, welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday.""CARDINAL DONALD WUERL, ARCHBISHOP OF WASHINGTON: Thank you. It's good to be here with you, Chris.WALLACE: Pope Francis puts this in the starkest terms. He says we're turning our precious earth into, quote, ""an immense pile of filth"" and he says that much of it is because of human activity. And he basically says it's a moral issue now.WUERL: And it really is. And I think one of the really strong parts of this is he starts with what we're all aware of and what's going on around the world: the diminishment of water, the desertification, the fact that we're destroying the rain forest, all of those terrible, terrible things -- we're all aware of that -- and the suffering of poor people because of this.But then he goes on to say: I invite everybody, I invite people in every walk of life, those who have authority over so many areas of life, to come together and talk about how we resolve, how we face, how we address it. And then he says, and we bring a moral dimension, that's what the church brings. That's what he brings to this discussion.WALLACE: The pope frames this as part of his -- I think it's fair to say -- continuing critique of the global market economy. And he writes this, he writes, ""Whatever is fragile, like the environment, is defenseless before the interest of the deified market, which become the only rule.""WUERL: And isn't that a fact that if you don't have a moral frame of reference, then you only are driven by your own self-interest -- whether it's economics, whether it's politics, whether it's finance -- everything has a moral dimension to it because it's human.And what the pope is holding up for us is we can't just close in on ourselves, our own personal interests, our economic or financial interests or political interests. We have to look at this through the moral dimension of, how does this affect everybody on the planet?WALLACE: Now, not surprisingly, some political figures are pushing back. Here is former governor and devout Catholic Jeb Bush.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BUSH: But I love -- first of all, Pope Francis is an extraordinary leader. But I don't get economic policy from my -- from my bishops or my cardinals or from my pope.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Cardinal, your response?WUERL: Well, I think that's a legitimate position to say I don't get policy from the church, from the pope. I don't -- I would hope that no politician gets policy from his faith committee, his faith community. But what we get is the moral frame of reference by which we arrive at those policy positions.The pope is talking about, what should we be doing, not here is a political agenda that you must accept. I think that's the richness of his contribution to all of this. There is a human dimension to everything we do and that, therefore, carries with it a moral and ethical dimension.And the pope is simply saying, whether you're a politician, a financier, an economist, an industrialist, whatever you are, look at the consequences of what you're doing through the lens of humanity and through the moral obligation to include everyone in the effort to have a truly good and just society.WALLACE: Now, while the pope has bigger things on his mind than American politics, some American conservatives say he is choosing sides.Cardinal, forgive me because this is going to get a little salty.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Essentially, what this papal encyclical is suggesting is that every Catholic should vote for the Democrat Party. Well, no, that's what -- how in the hell else do you interpret it when the pope comes out and sounds like Al Gore on global warming and climate change?(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: I never thought I'd ask you this. How do you respond to Rush Limbaugh?WUERL: Well, this is one of the great -- one of the great blessings of America, isn't it? We're all allowed to speak our mind even if we don't have all of the facts, even if we don't have a clear view of what the other person is saying. We're all allowed to speak our mind and that's what he's doing.I think what the pope is doing is something very, very different from that. He's saying, why don't we all discuss this? Why don't we all come to the table and before we start eliminating other people from the discussion, before denouncing them or even ridiculing them, why don't we listen to them and see what they're saying, and see where we ought to be going as a human family?WALLACE: Let's discuss some of the substantive questions or even criticism of the pope's message. While the Holy Father says a number of scientific studies hold the world is warming and human activity is a major role, there are certainly experts on the other side who question, really, whether there is a consistent pattern of warming, as opposed to just sort of the variations of climate over the ages, and how much human activity plays a role.What does the pope say to those people?WUERL: Well, I think what he is saying in the encyclical is we have to -- we have to realize that there are these terrible results. He's not indicating what is the cause of every single disaster around the world, ecological disaster, but he's saying we need to start looking at this.I come from western Pennsylvania. I can tell you that strip mining left a disastrous wake. And I think these are the type of things the Holy Father is lifting up for us and saying, we need to look at this because there are human factors in all of these ecological disasters.WALLACE: The pope also and very much puts this in the frame of the fact that all of this environmental despoliation hurts the poor most of all. Some -- they pay the biggest price. Some skeptics say, look, you're going to spend, you're asking us to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to take actions which may cause jobs to be lost, which are going to have a minute effect on the environment. It may lower it a tenth of 1 percent, and you could be spending that money instead on malaria nets, on vaccination, on crop improvement.What does the pope say to that?WUERL: I think he's looking long-term. While he's saying there's an urgency to this issue, the urgency is that we begin to talk about it, address it, put our minds together to resolve it. He's not saying that we have to resolve this tomorrow by doing specific things.And I think the starting point is for us to remember any time you address a worldwide problem, it's going to take time to resolve. I think back to the days of the encyclical on human labor in 1891. There were those who rejected it outright saying, if we start treating workers the way the church is asking us, our profits will be cut, our ability to compete will be cut.But we learned over years and over decades, when people thrive, the whole planet thrives.WALLACE: The pope visits the United States in September. He's going to speak to Congress. He's going to speak to the United Nations.And while liberals are generally celebrating his comments on the environment, conservatives note that in this encyclical, he also wrote this, ""Since everything is interrelated, concern for the protection of nature -- I'm having a little trouble reading this -- concern for the protection for nature is also incompatible with the justification of abortion.""WALLACE: Does the pope worry that his trip is becoming too political, that people are going to pick and choose, I like this part of what he says, I like this part of what he says, or, in fact, does he embrace the opportunity to spread his message?WUERL: I think he probably recognizes, as popes have always had to recognize, certainly as we bishops have to recognize, there are those who take part of what we say and there are others that take another part of what we say. But we have to keep saying the whole package. We have to keep delivering the entire package.I think that's what the pope does. And he takes joy in it when you see him delivering a talk, a homily, you see him in the midst of people, he takes great joy in representing the whole faith, the whole package.But there will always be some discussion among people what part they like best and for some, what part they're going to accept.But the obligation on all of us, if we're true members of the church and true followers of the Lord, then we take the Lord's message even when there are parts of it we're uncomfortable with.WALLACE: In that sense, and in the sense of embracing controversy and pushing boundaries, he's a different kind of pope, isn't he, with a different sense of his mission?WUERL: That's how this encyclical opens, doesn't it? An invitation. He said, this is an invitation to talk about all of these problems.And he invites everybody. He says everybody of goodwill, I invite to sit and let's talk about how we're going to resolve this, as opposed to here are some things we all ought to do to resolve that. It's very invitational.But don't you think that's the reason he's so popular? People feel they're being invited back into a discussion of the Lord, of discipleship, of what it means to embrace the gospel and live it.WALLACE: Cardinal Wuerl, thank you. Thanks for coming in today, sir.WUERL: You're very welcome. Thank you, Chris.WALLACE: We'll stay on top of this very important debate.WUERL: Thank you.WALLACE: Up next, Rick Perry 2.0. Can the presidential candidate undo the mistakes of his 2012 campaign? The former Texas governor joins us, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: When Rick Perry ran for president in 2012, he shot to the top of the polls. But that ended quickly after a series of gaffes, especially forgetting in a debate one of three government agencies he wanted to eliminate.Well, now, the former Texas governor is running again and says he learned from all that.Governor Perry, welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday.""RICK PERRY (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Good to be with you. Thank you.WALLACE: Let's start with the elephant in the room, I think you'd agree, your embarrassing run for president in 2012.What happened?PERRY: Obviously we weren't healthy. I highly recommend anybody running for the presidency, make sure you're healthy. I had major back surgery. And I didn't prepare properly. I think the real issue there was I thought being governor of the state of Texas for 12 years was enough preparation to run for the presidency, and the fact of the matter is, there is nothing like it. Until you've done it, you don't even realize what a challenge it is. These broad array of issues that you have to have more than just passing knowledge of.WALLACE: What did you learn from it?PERRY: Well, I learned, number one, you have to be healthy, and secondly, you have got to prepare. And it takes years of preparation, I will suggest to you, whether it's sitting down with real experts on foreign policy, people like Richard Fisher (ph) to James Ricards (ph) on the monetary side of things. Sitting with George Shultz and Henry Kissinger and Brian Hook (ph) at the Hay (ph) Initiative. Individuals who have deep knowledge of what's going on in the world, absorbing it, studying it, and keeping this up for some lengthy period of time. I feel very comfortable now sitting on the stage that I can have those conversations, and regurgitate that information that I know and that I've absorbed in a way that the American people are going to see a very different candidate than they did four years ago.WALLACE: Let me talk to you about that, because on Friday you were talking about the shooting in Charleston, and you said accident when you meant incident. It was clearly a slip of the tongue. But social media went nuts, which raises the question, which I thought for some time, don't you have to run almost a perfect campaign? Because if you make any mistake that any other candidate, it would be ignored, people will say, whoops, that's Rick Perry again.PERRY: I don't think they are going to ignore anybody, whether it's Hillary Clinton calling a reporter by the wrong name within the last 24 hours or me calling you Mike instead of Chris. People are going to make mistakes and people know that.But what people want to see is someone who truly has a vision for this country. Who has a record. And I will lay my record out, 14 years as the chief executive of the 12th largest economy in the world, that economic record. My military history, not only of wearing the uniform of this country but having been the commander in chief of the Texas military forces, the Texas National Guard. My dealing with things like the border, like Ebola, with massive hurricanes. All of that is a record that the people are going to look at. Are they going to say, hey, listen, you said one word when you meant another one? Social media can do what they want to do with that. But when you really get down to it, record is what's going to matter in this election.WALLACE: One more campaign question, and we'll get into the issues. You're focusing on Iowa, where you have already spent since 2012, 31 days. But in the latest RealClearPolitics average of recent polls, you are now running 11th in Iowa after 31 days at 3 percent, which raises the question, Governor, realistically, do you have a chance to win, or is this campaign more about personal redemption, showing people that you're not the Rick Perry of 2012?PERRY: Well, I will tell you what the Terry Branstad, the governor of Iowa, said as late as 72 hours ago, when he was asked about who was spending time in Iowa. He said let me compliment Rick Perry. Rick Perry has got a powerful organization, and he has spent the time in this state.WALLACE: So why are you at 3 percent?PERRY: This is a process. Rudy Giuliani led through '07 and '08. I just try to remind people don't get hung up on today's poll. Let's see what it looks like in January. We're going to spend a lot of time there. We're going to talk about a vision for this country that's positive, that's I think very forward leaning and looking, and people are going to -- people I think are going to get behind that and like that.WALLACE: You are running on a strong populist message this time. Here's a clip from your announcement statement.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PERRY: The American people, they see this rigged game where the insiders get rich, the middle class pays the tab. There is something wrong when the Dow is near record highs, and businesses on Main Street can't even get a loan.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Governor, you sound like Bernie Sanders.PERRY: I sound like a young man that grew up on a dry land cotton form that understands what it's like to have to really work hard. In today's world, a lot of Americans are out there, and they are going, hey, wait a minute, what are these people on Wall Street getting rich for? Who is going to bail me out?(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: -- class warfare, isn't that what Republicans always --PERRY: No. That's common sense. What is wrong is Washington bailing out companies that make bad decisions. That's a reason we have bankruptcy laws. And I think the American people want to see fairness in that. They don't want to see somebody that's on Wall Street, somebody that's got connections in that Capitol building over there, be the only ones that have protection in this country. I think they're looking for an individual who grew up in a house that used an outhouse. My mom bathed me on a back porch in a No. 2 wash tub. Someone that's actually had to really work to get to somewhere in life, and it wasn't given to him on a silver platter.Americans are ready for a great success story, and to know that their kids -- we've got a social compact with one generation to the next. And Americans don't believe that's possible today. And I want to give them hope that it really is possible again by leveling that playing field.WALLACE: But is it right or fair to bash the rich? Do you want to limit what people on Wall Street make? Do you want to tax them more? Are you saying that we want to somehow limit the gains in the Dow? You talk about the Dow being at an all-time high. There are a lot of working folks who have their retirement investments, their savings in the stock market.PERRY: I think people want to see fairness. When you see the rules that are in place nowadays, when you see all the exemptions, I think people want to see a fair tax rate, they want to be able to keep more of what they work for. In the 12th largest economy in the world, state of Texas that I had the privilege to be the chief executive of for the last 14 years, we made a state that allowed people to have jobs, an environment that allowed them to keep more of what they worked for. And that's what Americans want. They would like to see the same thing, and they don't see that today. They see Wall Street getting bailed out. They see General Motors getting bailed out.WALLACE: You keep saying Wall Street is getting bailed out. They got bailed out during a specific time when we had this huge financial crisis.PERRY: Let me explain --WALLACE: Would you have let all of Wall Street collapse? People say the financial system would have collapsed.PERRY: Let me explain to you where people really feel that what's happening in Washington is hurting them out in middle America. Dodd-Frank regulations. We got 41 percent fewer community banks today than we had in 2007. There are people all over this country, middle Americans, farmers in Iowa, who use those community banks. And you see these regulations that are strangling their ability to get a loan. That's what I'm talking about. That's what people see as Washington being disconnected with what's really going on out there on Main Street.WALLACE: One more question about Main Street or looking out for the little guy. When you were governor of Texas, your state had the highest uninsured rate in the country. One in five, more than one in five Texans didn't have health coverage, and yet you refused to set up a state exchange under Obamacare. You refused to expand Medicaid. Is that looking out for the little guy when 21 percent of Texans didn't have health insurance?PERRY: If how you keep score is how many people you force to buy insurance, then I would say that that's how you keep score. That's not how we --WALLACE: But the flip side of it, how many people don't have health insurance.PERRY: Let me explain what we do in Texas. This is a state by state decision. We make access to healthcare the real issue. We passed the most sweeping tort reform in the nation. We got 35,000 more positions licensed to practice medicine in 2013 than we did a decade before that. This is an issue for me, it's about access to healthcare. And it's not about whether you force somebody to buy insurance. It's whether Texans have access to good healthcare.We have got the Texas Medical Center, and physicians are showing up in places that literally we didn't have physicians to do those subspecialties ten years ago that we do today.WALLACE: I understand that, sir, but don't you, as the governor for 14 years, don't you feel some responsibility when 21 percent of the people in your state didn't have health insurance?PERRY: That's not how we keep score. I think it's a fallacy to say access to healthcare is all about insurance. What we happen to say in the state of Texas is we're going to try to make as assessable as we can good, quality healthcare. And that's what we've done in the state of Texas.Do you think all those people moved to the state of Texas because somehow know they couldn't get healthcare? 5.6 million people added to the population rolls, oh and by the way, 1.5 million jobs created between 2007 and 2014. That's what people care about. They know they can come to the state of Texas and have access to really good healthcare, and government was not going to force them to buy insurance.WALLACE: Finally, at the end of these interviews, we try to get off the issues and try to get some personal insight into the person, man or woman I'm talking to. At your announcement a couple of weeks ago, Marcus Luttrell, the lone survivor was there alongside you. I bet a lot of people don't know that long before the book or the movie and all of his fame, that he showed up on your door at the governor's mansion in 2007 and he was in trouble.PERRY: He was. He had separated from the service. He had some real challenges physically, mentally. And he was looking for a safe harbor. He found it with Rick and Anita Perry.WALLACE: What did you do for him?PERRY: We brought him. We intervened. He had been separated, but not given full medical discharge. He wasn't eligible for Tricare. I intervened all the way up to the secretary of the Navy. Secretary Mabus, and Secretary Mabus, to his credit, engaged in this process, and we were able to get him eligible for Tricare so he could have the surgeries, he could have the intervention that he needed.WALLACE: But if I may, because we're running out of time here, more than that, you said in your announcement he's a second son.PERRY: We became and still are incredibly close to him. We brought him in. My wife is a nurse. So we worked very closely with him. I mean, he literally lived with us for two plus years, and we took care of him, and we've seen him now become a very healthy, very successful dad and a great American.WALLACE: Governor Perry, thank you. Good to talk with you again.PERRY: Always a good interview with you, sir.WALLACE: Thank you. We'll see you on the campaign trail.PERRY: Lord willing.WALLACE: Up next, the GOP field got even more crowded this week with Jeb Bush and Donald Trump getting into the race. We'll bring our Sunday group back to discuss where the campaign stands now. And what would you like to ask the panel about Donald Trump actually running for president? Just go to Facebook or Twitter @foxnewssunday, and we may use your question on the air.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BUSH: Not one of us deserves the job by right of resume, party, seniority, family or family narrative. It's nobody's turn. It's everybody's test and it's wide open. Exactly as the contest for president should be.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Jeb Bush this week formally getting into the presidential race and pushing back at criticism he's running on his family name. We're back now with the panel.Karl, Bush clearly hasn't scared other candidates out of the race. We're going to end up with about 15 or 16. He clearly hasn't broken away in the polls. What does he need to do and what are his biggest challenges?ROVE: First of all, nobody should expect someone to break away in the polls. If you look at the last nine Republican presidential primary contests going back to 1964, they take two different shapes. In four of them, somebody led by double digits at this point, and in five of them someone led by single digits. We're in the single digit territory and we'll remain in the single digit territory throughout I think a lot of this contest until people actually start going to vote.But if you look underneath the surface, there's a brand new Wall Street Journal/NBC poll out. If you take a look at the people who say I can see myself voting for that person, five people have done well since this question began to be asked in March. Jeb Bush has gone up 26 points from 49 percent saying they could support him to 75. Marco Rubio has gone from 56 to 24. Mike Huckabee from 52 to 65. Carly Fiorina from 18 to 31. And Ted Cruz from 40 to 51. Those are the five winners among the 16 people who were in the poll. So obviously something is going on underneath there. And I think that clip captured it for Jeb Bush. He has got to show people that first of all, has to earn this. He went on to say, I have to earn it, and second of all, he's got to lay out a concrete, optimistic, conservative agenda, demonstrate he's willing to go in places Republicans don't normally go, and he's got to be able to show that he's got the chops to be the candidate who can beat Hillary Clinton.WALLACE: Senator Bayh, let me pick up on that. How do you assess Jeb Bush if he were to win the Republican nomination? Would he be the strongest candidate the GOP could put up against Clinton?BAYH: If he runs as a successful former governor, a reform conservative, he's got a pretty good narrative, Chris. But my guess is that really their strongest candidate would be somebody who embodies the future, something different, something new. What I sense is that is what people are really looking for. So that may be a Scott Walker. It may be a Marco Rubio if he can project the kind of gravitas people are looking for.But I think a Clinton/Bush race would be very, very close. But I think Hillary would have an advantage in that because it will be tough for Jeb to stand for the future, something dynamic, something different.WALLACE: Then there's Donald Trump, who also got into the race this week and almost immediately started taking off after some of his Republican rivals. Starting with Jeb Bush. Here he is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He looks very unhappy to me. He doesn't look like a person that wants to be doing this.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Scott Walker?TRUMP: The problem is, Wisconsin is having a lot of problems. They are doing not well. And there's a tremendous amount of debt being piled up and they're having a lot of difficulty.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel, and we got this on Facebook from Richard Wellman, who writes, ""why should anyone care about Trump running other than the damage he causes stirring up the GOP fringe?"" Deneen, how do you answer Richard, and speak to this question, how much trouble do you think Trump is going to cause the GOP?BORELLI: I look at Trump as like the Uber of today. You know, how Uber has disrupted the taxi cab industry. So we'll see what happens as this all unfolds. But I think Trump -- and I'm not endorsing anyone -- he's someone that could be viewed as a problem solver. When you look at someone like Jeb Bush, for example, he's someone that's been out of the game for a while. The polls are a reflection of who he is. And I think Bush will have a problem trying to really fire up the conservative base because of his views on common core and immigration, which is something that Donald Trump can come after Bush against. So I think that's something that will be of concern. But again, Donald Trump, who knows what's going to happen. With politics, anything is possible.WALLACE: But do you worry at all as a conservative, as a Republican, when Trump in his announcement speech talks about Mexicans coming over the border are they are rapists and criminals, and I assume some good people, I think that's a rough quote of what he said. Is that helpful in reaching out to Hispanics?BORELLI: No, no, absolutely not. Some of his comments are not helpful at all. But again, as I said before, we'll see how this plays out. We'll see if he dials it back from what he said before. Who knows.WALLACE: Who knows. Isn't that the truth.On the Democratic side, the big story this week is what people are calling Bernie-mentum. And that is the fact that Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, an avowed Democratic Socialist, is running around the country, attracting huge crowds. In the latest New Hampshire poll, only ten points behind Hillary Clinton. Congresswoman Edwards, how do you explain Bernie-mentum?EDWARDS: I think right now we're in an environment where the Democratic activist base is really paying attention to politics. I think it's important that the message that Bernie Sanders has is one that is challenging for Hillary Clinton to respond to and to define herself if she wants to get our nomination. And so I am actually glad that we're having this play out right now, because I think it will make our nominee at the end of the day, and I believe it will make our nominee a stronger one.WALLACE: Do you think it shows concern on the left side of the Democratic Party with whether Clinton is too centrist, too cozy with big business, too cozy with Wall Street??EDWARDS: I think that's an important concern, but I think part of what we've heard from Hillary Clinton, especially in the last couple of weeks, is her defining her candidacy, which is not her husband's presidency. And I think we're hearing that. We are hearing concern for families and children and working people, concerns around inequality, around race and criminal justice, and I think it's important that the left and all of our party hear that message so that we can rally behind a nominee so that we can retake the White House.WALLACE: Karl, let me ask you a couple of questions. How should Republicans handle Donald Trump?ROVE: Ignore him. He's completely off the base. I'm going to negotiate with ISIS? I have a secret plan to deal with ISIS but I can't tell you about it because of my enemies? As president I have unilateral authority to levy a 35 percent tax on any company that opens plants abroad? This guy is not a serious candidate. As of Friday at 5:00, he had yet to file a one-page declaration of his candidacy with the FEC. The reason he's not is because once he does that, that triggers a 30-day period during which he has to lay out in excruciating detail the range of his liabilities and his assets. He gets to have two 45-day extensions. He will delay filing that piece of paper, and mark my words, he will delay and ask for extensions as long as possible.He'll be a serious candidate. We ought to treat him as a serious candidate when he finally files that declaration and commits himself to unveiling all of his assets and liabilities.WALLACE: Are you suggesting that he may not actually run?ROVE: I'm surprised. He got into the race on Tuesday, and by Friday he still couldn't file a one-page piece of paper that required his name and his address and a signature on it.WALLACE: What does the excitement over Bernie Sanders tell you about Hillary Clinton?ROVE: I'm in agreement with the congresswoman. It might surprise her. But Hillary Clinton understands that the left of the Democratic Party does not trust her, and she made an announcement speech this week in which she basically said I'm not going to be Bill. I'm going to be more like Barack Obama. In fact, I'm going to be to the left of Barack Obama. And that's going to be great opportunity for the Republicans in the general election, because there's no way to climb back from being on the left wing of the Democratic Party by the time of the general election.WALLACE: Thank you, panel. See you all next Sunday. Up next, our Power Player of the Week, testing and defending common core education standards.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: A look at the Oakland Bay Bridge across the way from San Francisco.Common Core was started by governors and state education officials as a way to set standards for our children's education. But it's become a hot political issue with concerns over federal interference and whether it's the best way to teach kids. We went to see one group that's testing how common core works. Here's our Power Player of the Week.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)LAURA SLOVER, CEO, PARCC: I think it's vital that we set a high standard for kids because if we build it, they will come. If we expect a lot of kids, they rise to the occasion.WALLACE: Laura Slover is the CEO of PARCC, the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College And careers. PARCC is one of two nonprofits set up by states to test how students are measuring up to common core education standards.SLOVER: These are different kinds of tests. They measure critical thinking, problem solving, writing, and they actually ask kids to do more than fill in bubbles.WALLACE: Five million kids in 12 states from third grade through high school took the test for the first time this spring. Slover had me answer some of the third grade reading questions, which I found a little challenging.SLOVER: Put the events in order --WALLACE: You're kidding me. Drag this down?SLOVER: Drag and drop.WALLACE: A number of Republicans running for president have already weighed in on common core and the tests, and given them a flunking grade.GOV. BOBBY JINDAL, R-LA.: I'm still for high standards. Common core was never supposed to be a top down government run approach.SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS: I think the federal government has no business dictating the curriculum of schools.WALLACE: The main complaint is that this is all part of a federal takeover of local schools.SLOVER: This is a state-driven program, and states make all the decisions, from design to development to administration.WALLACE: But it's more complicated than that. Because President Obama's Race to the Top program gives states grants based on their adopting standards like common core. Another issue, tens of thousands of parents and students across the country are refusing to take the tests.SLOVER: As a parent I can understand why there are concerns about testing.WALLACE: But Slover says she wants her child taking the tests, which lasts more than eight hours over several days, for a third grader.SLOVER: I want to be sure she's learning. I want to be sure she's reading on grade level and I want to be sure she knows how to do math and is prepared for the next grade.WALLACE: There is also criticism from teacher unions. They worry the test will be used to evaluate their performance.So what's your reaction when you're taking heat from both the right and from the left?SLOVER: We know we're doing something right. Keep on going.WALLACE: Slover says they will keep adjusting. For instance, next year, the tests will be 90 minutes shorter. But she says the basic principle is sound.SLOVER: For too long in this country, success has been really a function of what income level parents have and where kids grow up. We think it's critical that kids all have opportunities, whether they live in Mississippi or Massachusetts or Colorado or Ohio. They should all have access to an excellent education, and this is a step in the right direction.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: Whether it's a step in the right direction is of course debatable. You can expect common core to continue as a big issue in the Republican presidential campaign.You may recall, last season we declared ourselves the official Sunday show of the Washington Nationals. Well, yesterday star pitcher Max Scherzer was one strike away from a perfect game when he clipped a Pittsburgh Pirate batter. Then this happened.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: An 0-2 pitch. And a ball hit deep to the left. Taylor going back. And Max Scherzer has a no-hitter.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Scherzer pitched the second no-hitter in Nats history. In his last start, Scherzer pitched a one hitter. Congratulations to Max and go Nats.And that's it for today. To all of you dads out there, happy Father's Day. To my kids, be sure to call your dad.

7	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/06/20/bill-oreilly-president-obama-speaking-about-iraq/	Bill O'Reilly: President Obama speaking about Iraq	"By Bill O'ReillyTalking like a college professor the President outlined the problems Iraq faces because different Muslim sects cannot get along. Mr. Obama's analysis was long on detail, short on solutions.Even though the Pentagon recommends bombing the al Qaeda army which is slaughtering thousands of people and threatening to overwhelm Iraq, Mr. Obama says he will not bomb the terrorists who are moving back and forth the flat terrain to and from Syria. Instead he's sending in 300 American military advisors and asking for international help.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: We have immediate problems with terrorist organizations that may be advancing. And rather than try to play whack-a-mole wherever these terrorist organizations may pop up, what we have to do is to be able to build effective partnerships, make sure that they have capacity.(END VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: So, once again, the President seeks consensus from other countries rather than charting a direct course that might damage the evil al Qaeda.Now, there are two things in play. First, what's happening inside Iraq -- which few care about -- those people have been killing each other for centuries and are not likely to stop any time soon. Iran, a she a country next door, now holds power in southern Iraq. Who is going to counter that? No one. So, let's stay out of Iraqi politics. We can encourage the Shia-Sunni folks to be reasonable but don't expect it.The second Iraq issue is very important to America. We defeated terrorism there at a great cost in blood and treasure. Now terrorism is back. We cannot defeat it again on the ground. But we can damage the terrorists from the air. And we should do that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), SENATOR: Air strikes are an important factor psychologically and many other ways and that may require some forward air controllers and some special forces. We cannot afford to allow a Syria/Iraq enclave that will pose a direct threat to the United States of America.(END VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: As mentioned, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Martin Dempsey agrees with Senator McCain, but President Obama dissents. Why? All I could glean from remarks today is that he feels military action will lead to unintended consequences. Remember, he wouldn't pull the trigger in Syria on the poison gas deal and generally is very cautious about direct action to right wrongs. He would rather have meetings.As ""Talking Points"" stated after the President pulled back on Syria that emboldens our enemies. They don't believe Mr. Obama the will to punish them; Putin, China, now al Qaeda -- all directly challenging America and the world. Even though President Obama's poll numbers are falling, he knows many Americans have lost the will to fight abroad. Iraq and Afghanistan have drained us.Mr. Obama is basically a man of theory, not action, a person who avoids evil rather than confronting it. And the evildoers know it.And that's ""The Memo."""

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.
SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to ""Hannity."" So after President-elect Donald Trump's decisive victory, he now has a mandate to act on behalf of you, the American people. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani will be here in just a minute with reaction.But first, my advice to Donald Trump tonight is move fast and keep all of your promises. Earlier today, President-elect Trump met at the White House with President Obama to discuss the transition of power.I'm sure Obama extended an olive branch in a last ditch attempt to try and preserve whatever legacy he has. Now the president can play nice all he wants, but make no mistake about it, Democrats want Trump to fail.They will do everything they could do to stop him. Remember, it was only a few days ago, they're playing all nice today, that Obama was saying this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be commander-in-chief. We cannot elect a president who vilifies minorities, who mocks Americans with disabilities, who calls immigrants criminals and rapists.If you accept the support of Klan sympathizers before your president, then you'll accept their support after you're president. Donald Trump is uniquely unqualified to hold the job.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Don't forget about how President Obama really feels about Republicans.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: I need you to go out and talk to your friends and talk to your neighbors, talk to them whether they're independent or whether they are Republican, I want you to argue with them and get in their face.I don't want the folks who created the mess, I don't want the folks who created the mess to do a lot of talking. I want them to get out of the way so we can clean up the mess.Middle class families up in front. We can't -- we don't mind the Republicans joining us. They can come for the ride, but they got to sit in the back.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Got to sit in back. So inclusive when he won. Remember he often said I won. We won, said that a lot. Now keep all of that in mind. This isn't about coming together with Democrats. This is about completely dismantling his disastrous agenda.That's going to mean this, repealing, replacing ObamaCare, replace it with free market solutions to lower premiums and give you the American people real choices about your future health care.That also means building that border wall, stopping illegal immigration so that Americans won't be competing for jobs with illegal immigrants who are driving down wages.That means he's got to follow up on appointing originalists to the Supreme Court, like Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, justices who believe in coequal branches of government, separation of powers, who will follow the constitution the way the foundered intended it to be followed.Now Trump as laid out and put out a very strong list of potential Supreme Court picks. He should stick to the list. It also means his agenda on energy independence, approving the Keystone Excel pipeline and lifting restrictions on drilling and fracking so we don't have to pretend to be friends with countries that hate our guts.Not to mention that this will create millions of jobs for Americans that desperately need them. It also means draining the swamp, reducing the size of government, eliminating bureaucratic ways, fraud and abuse, and getting or exploding debt under control, stop robbing our kids blind.It means lowering taxes, simplifying the tax code, he said seven brackets to three. It means identifying who America's enemies are and who they really are and not be afraid to use the term radical Islam.Also it means extreme vetting of refugees so they won't put American lives at risk. It means, of course, no more common core in school, send education back to the states and it also means remembering the millions of forgotten Americans, the people who have been left behind or completely ignored for decades by career politicians, the media, and the global elites.I call it the forgotten man election and it's time to make free trade deals, lower the corporate tax rate, allow companies to repatriate trillions of dollars from overseas so that we can build factories and manufacturing centers and create millions of jobs here.Here with reaction now, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. There's a lot of rumors about you these days --RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Rumors are rumors. The agenda you've outlined he's absolutely going to do.HANNITY: He's committed to.GIULIANI: Yes. I spent 130 days on the road with him. Sometimes we were the only ones up at 1:00 in the morning because the kids would go to sleep.  I love that. Both me and I loved it because we were older than both of them.The thing about Donald Trump that the American people will get to know, and I think he's going to become more and more popular is, he is exactly what he says he is. Sometimes that got him in trouble, as we know.But everything he promised he believes in. It's not one of these, you know, I'm for the Keystone pipeline and then I'm against the Keystone pipeline. He's in favor of it. He's going to do it.He is dead set on renegotiating those trade agreements. You didn't mention the Iran agreement. He considers the Iran agreement the dumbest, stupidest --HANNITY: Did you see what the Iranians said? The Iranians said he has to keep it.GIULIANI: No, he doesn't. The president never submitted it to congress as he should have under Article 2 Section 2 of the United States Constitution.  It's a treaty. I invite the people at home to go get out The Federalist papers and read Federalist paper 75 where Hamilton defines a treaty.  This is a treaty. When it's not a treaty, just signed by the president, the next president can repudiate it like that.HANNITY: How many items off the top of your head on day one, you know, executive orders can he wipe out?GIULIANI: I haven't counted them, I would say easily 50.HANNITY: Right away including executive amnesty.GIULIANI: Executive amnesty, all kinds of powers that were given to EPA, the Congress --HANNITY: Gone.GIULIANI: Give to the EPA, which is how he revives the energy industry.  The energy industries is being crushed by the EPA and they're being crushed by things that Congress wouldn't pass that Obama signed into so-call law by executive order. Most of that will get struck down by the courts two or three years from now. A President Trump can just sign a paper and get rid of it.HANNITY: Let's go back to September 8th, 1974, then President Gerald Ford, let me read, ""I, Gerald Rord, president of the United States pursuant to the pardon power conferred upon me by Article 2 Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution have granted and by the present and grant full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States which he, Richard Nixon has committed or may have taken part in during the period from January 20, '69 through August 9th, 1974.""Now a lot of people have said to me today, well, wait a minute, Hillary has not been charged.GIULIANI: That doesn't matter.HANNITY: If you become the attorney general, Donald Trump has been very clear that we can't have a two-tier justice system and that these issues about the e-mail server and the foundation will be pursued.GIULIANI: Yes. Also the foundation investigation is still going on.HANNITY: Do you think Obama will pardon her? Does he have the ability to?GIULIANI: He does.HANNITY: Is it absolute?GIULIANI: In my view and my reading of the constitution, which don't take it as gospel, but I know it fairly well, I believe the president's pardon power is absolute. We're constitutionalists so we would like for it not to be, but it is. Theoretically, he could pardon her for basically anything - -HANNITY: She has done.GIULIANI: That has already happened. He can't pardon her obviously for something she does in the future, but anything she has already done.HANNITY: Amazing. If you were the attorney general --GIULIANI: What about Abedin, Cooper, Mills, Pagliano, the guys who took the Fifth and apparently committed perjury. Wikileaks, you've got the proof of the perjury. There's a whole group of them out there that the Justice Department, an honest Justice Department would be pursuing. And I can tell you that the FBI is pursuing it.BAIER: There will be some Republicans that say you've got to focus on the agenda, this will be a distraction, let Clinton go.GIULIANI: There's an argument to be made for that, but there's also an argument to be made for equal justice under the law, which is how do you not prosecute some of these and then go ahead and prosecute Martha Steward for one count of lying to the FBI?HANNITY: Or this guy in the jail now --GIULIANI: How do you prosecute the guy in jail for taking pictures of that submarine?HANNITY: Six pictures.GIULIANI: He sent them to his mom, right?HANNITY: No. He just had them in his phone. He took them for himself in a submarine and phones were allowed to be in the submarine and he's spending a year in jail right now.GIULIANI: So how do you prosecute him and then you don't prosecute this case assuming it turns out to be as substantial as some of the FBI agents believed it is.Remember, the investigation -- and Comey was very careful. He came to the conclusion on the e-mails that she shouldn't be prosecuted. First of all, that's not his decision to make. It's the Justice Department's decision to make. It was not really a definitive decision.Secondly, the Clinton Foundation investigation is an ongoing investigation as far as I can tell being carried out by the New York Office of the FBI.  That's going to sit on the desk of the next attorney general.HANNITY: You were on the road as you said 130-plus days with Donald Trump during this campaign, been one of his closest friends and advisers. You went out and campaigned hard for him. Obviously, he will want you in his cabinet. Is there any particular position you want? Would you like --GIULIANI: That's a discussion that Donald and I --HANNITY: So Hannity is not allowed in that discussion?GIULIANI: No. You're not allowed in that discussion. That is a very private discussion and there's a whole transition team and a whole process you have to go through and vetting and everything.HANNITY: Is there any one position you'd prefer?GIULIANI: Right now I'm pretty happy where I am. It would have to be something where I believe that only I could do that job.HANNITY: If I'm Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani becomes the AG, I'm serious, I'd be scared to death because I do believe Donald Trump. He said he would pursue it. And if you're the attorney general and I'm Hillary Clinton, I would be scared to death because I know how good a prosecutor you were. I was here when you were mayor. I remember the old press conferences.GIULIANI: Honestly, I was a better prosecutor than mayor.HANNITY: You were a pretty good mayor.GIULIANI: The mafia.HANNITY: Yes, you went after the mob?GIULIANI: (Inaudible), a number of --HANNITY: You became friends with Milken, right?GIULIANI: Milken and I are good friends now and I believe Milken is an excellent candidate for a pardon.HANNITY: Wow. All right, Mr. Mayor --GIULIANI: And that's based on the good works that he's done after his conviction. This is a case of a guy who learned his lesson and has really helped society.HANNITY: All right. Thanks. He was the junk bonds guy. He does a lot of charity.GIULIANI: And I know a few others like that. You and I are Catholics and we know that people can redeem themselves.HANNITY: Absolutely.GIULIANI: Some people can't.HANNITY: Right.GIULIANI: Some people can and you got to know how to distinguish between.HANNITY: All right, Mr. Mayor, good to see you, thank you.Up next tonight right here on ""Hannity"" --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP: Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing the disaster known as ObamaCare.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: ObamaCare, a big fat government lie to you the American people.  Donald Trump told you he will repeal it. He'll replace it. How does he plan to do that? We'll check in with Dr. Ben Carson.And also later tonight, President-elect Trump, he promised to drain the swamp. Tonight, we speak with Laura Ingraham, Reince Priebus, and much more.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)JACKIE IBANEZ, FOX NEWS REPORTER: This is a Fox News alert. Another night of protests against President-elect Donald Trump underway in dozens of cities around the country. This is New York City. Hundreds of protesters are here gathered outside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue.The crowd holding up signs saying, quote, ""not my president"" and ""divided states of America."" Large crowds also taking to the streets in several cities on the west coast. In Portland, Oregon there's been some violence as they're taking over the highways.And President-elect Trump lashing out at the demonstration via Twitter saying, quote, ""Just had a very open and successful presidential election.  Now professional protesters incited by the media are protesting. Very unfair.""The supporters also taking to social media calling the demonstrators, quote, ""hypocrites"" for not accepting the democratic process. I'm Jackie Ibanez. Now back to ""Hannity."" For all of your headlines, log on to FoxNews.com.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Real change begins with the immediately repealing and replacing the disaster known as ObamaCare. With ObamaCare premiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting and deductibles are going right through the roof. We can repeal and replace ObamaCare and save health care for every family in Michigan and throughout the United States of America. We have to do it.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right. That is now President-elect Donald Trump on the campaign trail earlier this week promising to repeal and replace ObamaCare.  This is an issue weighing on the minds of many of the American people.After it was announced that ObamaCare premiums will once again skyrocket this coming year. Many people will be seeing double digit increases. How will the president-elect when he becomes president repeal and replace it?Joining us now, former 2016 presidential candidate, Dr. Benjamin Carson.  Dr. Carson, I read that you have been asked to be a part of this effort to repeal it and replace it. True?DR. BEN CARSON, FORMER 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Of course. And of course, I would be extraordinarily happy to help with this. Health care is by far the most important thing that a person has. And you know, this announcement of this big increase, this is just the first trunch.There's going to be several more. It's going to be completely unaffordable. It doesn't work. I think the people who put it together knew that it wouldn't work and that it would prime the people for acceptance of government controlled single pair systems. Fortunately, we've stopped that.HANNITY: All right, we're going to repeal it. How do you transition people back to it? How do you create free market health savings accounts with competition, with portability that allows for pre-existing conditions?  This is not an easy task, undoing this damage is going to be hard. Are you worried about transitional cost for people?CARSON: It's not an easy task but, you know, we have models for how to do it. How to create health savings accounts using the same monies that we used to buy, you know, exhorbantly, expensive health insurance.So that's a matter of putting the pieces together. Once that is done, you know, all you need then is your catastrophic health care which is going to be much, much cheaper. You know, the models are multiple. They will be worked out.It will be very easy for people to understand and 80 percent of your encounters with the health care system are going to be between you and the system. Not some third party individual.HANNITY: You know, one of the interesting things, I know this doctor in Wichita, Kansas, he actually set up his own cooperative and he buys medicines in bulk. He is available, him and his team, 24/7 for everybody in the cooperative. They all save money. They all get better care. They all get cheaper medicines.CARSON: Of course.HANNITY: You know, do you think you would be able to institutionalize that all around the country or something similar?CARSON: Well, similar things because, of course, if the relationship is between the patient and the health care provider, you're going to bring the whole medical system into the free market and free market forces will control costs and quality. It will be much better in both of those instances.HANNITY: Yes. All right. Will you take a position as health and human services secretary, surgeon general, would you take those positions if asked and have you been asked to take a position?CARSON: We're discussing these things. You know, I personally feel that you can do a lot from outside. But if that were the only way that it could be done, you know, obviously I'm going to do what needs to be done to assist this administration.HANNITY: So you have discussed it? You can say it. It's OK. You can share it with me.CARSON: Yes, there have been discussions.HANNITY: I happen to think it's a good choice, myself. You don't have to sell me on you, Dr. Carson. I'm a fan. This is going to be a difficult transition, but one that's necessary before this thing totally blows up, which it's kind of imploding now of its own weight. Dr. Carson, thanks --CARSON: It's not going to be so difficult because it's going to be logical.HANNITY: That's true. By the way, that's refreshing for Washington. Good to see you. Thank you, Dr. Carson.Coming up next tonight right here on ""Hannity.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: President-elect Donald Trump met with President Obama at the White House today. Laura Ingraham, she weighs in next.Plus the mainstream media and liberals generally are freaking out over President-elect Trump. Sheriff David Clark and Judge Jeanine Pirro will join in and weigh in later on in the program.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel. He explained some of the difficulties, some of the high flying assets and some of the really great things that have been achieved. So, Mr. President, it was a great honor being with you and I look forward to being with you many, many more times in the future. Thank you.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: President-elect Donald Trump met with President Obama at the White House earlier today. Now Mr. Trump promised voters that he would drain the swamp. How is he going to do that?Joining us now with reaction, editor-in-chief of LifeZette, Fox News contributor, nationally syndicated radio host, she put it all on the line this election. There's a group of people ready to go after her and yours truly.To me I think it's simple for Mr. Trump but difficult on the other hand. I think he just follows through on his promises, follows up on his agenda, his contract, drain the swamp is one of them. He laid out that speech in Gettysburg. Will that be hard with the Republican Congress?LAURA INGRAHAM, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, LIFEZETTE: I don't think so. I've talked to two or three people in leadership in the House and the Senate, and there's a palpable difference in tone and attitude. Everyone now is really excited about Trump being president, even those who were not all that thrilled, to say the least. So he's completely overnight changed the way the Republicans --HANNITY: Isn't that amazing? Isn't that nice of them to come on board? I guess everybody likes a winner, right?INGRAHAM: They do, Sean. It was frustrating, I think, just to back up a moment about this race because I think you were saying this, I was saying this. Just support the ticket and then you can debate about the nuances of policy if he wins.If he doesn't win all of these things we're wanting to do is never going to happen. Support the nominee through good and bad. Don't abandon him when he's at his most difficult spot, which a lot of them did.And now a lot of them are crawling back saying, I'm thrilled about this.  I'm going to work hard for you. It's better later than never, but I think we have to be careful as he said --HANNITY: The last ones on the ship will be the first ones off of the ship as soon as they hit any bumpy waters.INGRAHAM: Right. I think that's really important for Trump to remember.  He laid out some issues, you addressed them already on ObamaCare, immigration, both the wall and reduction really in illegal immigration, the type of immigration policy we've seen over last couple of decades.Since the 1960s we changed our immigration policy and most people aren't in favor of that. They want immigration to be controlled and work to the benefit of the American people. And that's a big undertaking. ObamaCare, immigration, tax reform, these are, these are things that are non- negotiable. He has to do these now.HANNITY: I think originalists, extreme vetting, I think building the wall, eliminating ObamaCare, health savings accounts, three tax brackets instead of seven, lowering the corporate tax rate, energy independence and education back to the states. If he does that, he will change this country in deep and profound ways even though it sounds easy.INGRAHAM: I think you're right. It will grow the economy, you throw in trade and limiting the foreign workers who are come into the country until wages start going up, all of those things will benefit the economy.And as a side benefit but nevertheless very important for the Republicans is that it will build the Republican Party out into a populous pragmatic party.When Trump can go into the inner city and say see, I did the things I said I was going to do and look at how people's lives are getting better, join us, continue to grow the movement that he started. That's when it gets really interesting.HANNITY: You know, how multinational corporations have trillions parked overseas and he'll also institute the lowest tax rate in the industrialized world. He can give them a further incentive.OK, if you take these old factories in Detroit, if you rebuild in Wisconsin or Ohio or Pennsylvania, in other words, those areas that have been devastated, I think it would transform the country and get people back to work and out of poverty and off of food stamps, it would do wonders for the economy, wonders for the people of this country.INGRAHAM: Think about the family dynamics that will also be improved.  There are so many breadwinners who are not in the workforce and they want to work, they want to maybe have less than -- fewer than three jobs. They would like to have one job that pays a decent salary.Families' lives improve. It has ripple effect that will be much better for the country if we have a growing strong economy. And the thing you have to smile about is that China is worried. If China was happy about who got to the presidency, that's a bad sign.HANNITY: The Iranians are too. You better keep that deal. I don't think that deal is worth the paper it's printed on. I'm hoping. All right, Laura, you've been great. Thank you.Coming up, liberal celebrities, mainstream media, they're losing their minds collectively. Why? Because you elected Donald Trump. Sheriff David Clark, Judge Jeanine Pirro, and wait until see, by the way, Miley Cyrus's crying meltdown, and then RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, and much more straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)IBANEZ: Live from America's news headquarters, I'm Jackie Ibanez.For the second night in a row thousands of people opposed to the election of Donald Trump are taking it to the streets. Here's what it looks like this evening along New York's Fifth Avenue just outside Trump Tower.  Similar scenes happening right now if more than a dozen other cities nationwide. Demonstrators, most of them young, are disrupting traffic as they march down the street carrying protest signs and chanting ""Not my president."" Some are waving Mexican flags as a reference to Mr. Trump's immigration policies.Police in riot gear are standing by, but so far there are no reports of serious violence. Trump supporters, meantime, have taken to social media to scorn the demonstrations. They accuse the protesters for being hypocrites for not accepting Tuesday's election results.I'm Jackie Ibanez. Now back to ""Hannity."" For all of your headlines, logon to FoxNews.com.HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" So on election night as vote totals were rolling in showing a very good night for president-elect Trump, the leftwing mainstream media, they were having a meltdown. Take a look at some of the worst moments -- I guess some of the best from an entertainment point of view, of the night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: America is crying tonight. I'm not sure how much of America, but a very significant portion, and I mean literally crying. And it is a moment filled with fear.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Fear.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Filled with fear.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Some of this cultural anger we should correctly identify as being racial animus. And it's significant that Trump has closed so much of a gap and done so well with white voters. The extent to which Donald Trump has won running a campaign of racism and bigotry, turning out millions of white Americans for that campaign, suggests that we are living through a kind of second redemption.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Our country is about to face some serious crises.  And so buckle up. Your country needs you.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Your son is serving as a marine. You wouldn't trust his life under that commander in chief and he said I wouldn't. That's a pretty extraordinary thing to say if you have a son in the Marine Corps and you don't trust the commander in chief, the people in the military who defend the constitution.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a white-lash, this was a white-lash against a changing country. It was a white-lash against a black president in part.  And that's the part where the pain comes.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: White-lash? Mainstream media, they weren't the only group lashing out. Last night whiny, sore loser progressives took to the streets often blocking traffic in several of America's busiest cities in order to vent their frustrations.Joining us now with reaction, Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, the host of ""Justice"" Judge Jeanine Pirro. Sheriff, this is fairly predictable. Any time conservatives win, Republicans win, the left goes into complete meltdown mode. The things we will hear in the next four years, I'm warning my audience, it shouldn't shock you. They are going to lose collectively their minds. That's my prediction. How should we deal with it?SHERIFF DAVID CLARKE, MILWAUKEE COUNTY: First of all, I just thoroughly enjoyed that montage you showed of the left where you played the left in meltdown mode. It's fun to watch.Look, this is a great day in America. I remember back in 2007 when Barack Obama won his first election showed up in Grant Park in Chicago south side and they showed a picture of Jesse Jackson with a tear rolling down his cheek. That was me the other night as Donald Trump took the stage.And Fox News I believe was the first to announce that Donald Trump was the president-elect of the United States. And today I still have to pinch myself. I said it several times on your show, Sean, I said that Donald Trump would win. But to be in that moment now post-election, I mean, I don't smile much but I'm smiling from ear to ear today.HANNITY: I've seen you smile, sheriff. I've been at events with you where you're smiling. Judge, your reaction?JUDGE JEANINE PIRRO, HOST, ""JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE"": My reaction to the media is not surprise at all. Look, what we've got is a bunch of wusses, all right, who tried to convince America that we are a racist country, that Donald Trump is all of this isms and ists, and I'm not even going to go through it because I think it's defamatory. But they are the people who are the racists and the anarchists and who support these wimps, who especially on college campuses and these people who are protesting, they are anarchists.  They don't believe in America. They want to burn flags. They want to not work. They want to get a check. They want illegals, they want open borders.You know what, it's time people recognize that we have a country that works for a living, that works hard to make sure that we can afford food and rent for our families, and that we deserve a president who believes that's it all about us Americans, and not a global, you know, country and a global economy. And by the way, you know, when they hang Donald Trump in effigy and they say love Trumps hate, they're the hypocrites, they're the people who are violating the law.HANNITY: Sheriff, let me give you some examples. Slate has a piece, ""White Won,"" Van Jones, ""This was a white-lash,"" Cokie Roberts, ""there's great hostility to having a female president."" ""People have to die,"" some of these anti-Trump protesters were saying. By the way, if any of these celebrities want to leave, I'll help them get out.You know, how to impeach a president, Google shows a 500 percent increase.  Some in California want to leave the union, for crying out loud. Some social media comments, ""Trump should be assassinated."" And this is only the beginning of it. You saw a video of the guy who was beaten over this whole thing. And you've got schools telling kids if you're so traumatized we'll offer you counseling to deal with your grief and shock over Donald Trump's victory. I don't know whether to laugh or cry.CLARKE: Well, a little of both. This is nothing more than an attempt to intimidate the Trump administration and intimidate the Trump supporters.  This is a slap in the face of the voters. In our democracy the voters decide who will lead these institutions of government, and numbers came out enough to make Donald Trump the president-elect of the United States. It's going to take them time, but they'll get over it. But in the meantime you put up with them like a petulant two-year-old, you let them dance and have their tantrum, and then at some point you take them by the arm and you look them in the eye and you go, that's enough.HANNITY: Grow up. I think my favorite, though, is Miley Cyrus posting this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MILEY CYRUS, SINGER: I do want to say that I have been very vocal for my support for everyone besides Donald Trump. Heavily supported Bernie, heavily supported Hillary. And I still think that in her lifetime she deserves to be the first female president. And that's what makes me so sad, that I just wish she had an opportunity because she's fought for so long.(END VIDEO CLIP)PIRRO: I want to know what she's fought for. And every time I hit the streets I say to people, what has she done other than as senator? She's got a post office named and a road named. And you know, Miley Cyrus, this is a lesson for you and all of your Hollywood elite friends, that you don't have any power or any control, we don't give a damn what you think or what you say. And you know what, get over yourself. You sing well, keep on singing. And that's enough about politics.HANNITY: I think we'll leave it there.CLARKE: Drama queen.HANNITY: Drama queen.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: I wasn't exactly happy in '08 and 2012.PIRRO: We didn't protest.HANNITY: I didn't protest, I didn't cry, didn't act like a baby. Good grief, grow up, you people. If you need counseling over a presidential election, you're a mess to begin with.PIRRO: Dog therapy, they're bring in dogs to the campuses.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: Little safe spaces, free counseling sessions, group therapy, hug it out.PIRRO: What a bunch of wusses.HANNITY: Coming up, president-elect Donald Trump had a busy morning in D.C. after meeting with the president at the White House. Mr. Trump and the vice president elect Mike Pence, they met with Speaker Ryan on Capitol Hill. So how can the party come together and fix this economy which is a mess? We'll check in with RNC Chairman Reince Priebus straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What's the top three?TRUMP: We have a lot. We're going to first look at the border, we're going to look at health care, and we're looking at jobs, big league jobs.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: That was president-elect Donald Trump earlier today on Capitol Hill detailing his administration's priorities.Now Mr. Trump along with vice president elect Mike Pence met with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan during their visit to Washington today. The voters have spoken and exit polls show that 69 percent of voters said that they were dissatisfied or angry with how the federal government was working. So what are they going to do to fix it? Here now, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus is with us. Good to see you. By the way, congratulations.REINCE PRIEBUS, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Yes.HANNITY: A lot of people had doubts about a system that you had built since 2012 to get more voters to the polls. Do you feel that it was as successful as you had hoped?PRIEBUS: Well, the result was pretty good. Let me just first say before I talk about that, you have to start with a great candidate. And if you don't have the change candidate that's authentic and genuine in a change year, you can have all the data age turnout you want, it's not going to work. So it's starts with Donald Trump, president-elect Trump, number one.But number two, you know, we've been working for four years. We added -- I was just looking before this interview. We added 300,000 more Republicans on the voter rolls through party registration in Florida. We also predicted turnout.Try to keep it basic. The most difficult thing you can do mechanically, the data and people on the ground are important. But you have to figure out what your prediction is for turnout so that you can actually try to figure out how many votes you need in the box in order to win. That's where our operation was dead on accurate. So predicting how many voters you need.For example, in Ohio we thought we would need 2.745 million voters in Ohio.  We received 2.771 million votes in Ohio. And I can go through state after state like that. But having margins down perfectly is where it begins, and then the process of either adding voters to the rolls, and/or targeting or both is where the targeting and adding people in and then putting those people in the box is the process that we go through, and it's a four-year program. So it's not just showing up three months before an election and saying let's just start knocking on doors. It's a targeting program that started four years ago and culminated with a great candidate who really shocked the world.HANNITY: What do you make of the 69 percent of voters say they're dissatisfied? But also go back to the Republican primaries, and 64 percent of Republicans felt betrayed by the Republican Party. Donald Trump was the outsider, was the change agent. And now he's got to work with many of those same Republicans. Do you foresee any problems, any conflict?PRIEBUS: I don't see a lot of problems because I've gotten to know president-elect Trump well. I know how he interacts with people in private. I know how gracious and personable he is. Look at what happened today. You don't get to where Donald Trump is, president-elect Trump, I have got to get used to that, you do not get there by being a person who doesn't understand the audience, the situation he's in, and acting in a way that affects the best outcome for his agenda. That is what he's going to do.Let me just say tangentially to that, the voters spoke. And they elected Republicans in the White House, the Senate, the House. And they did it with great fervor. And so the agenda of the party and particularly the agenda of president-elect Trump is going to be the agenda that we pursue because that is what voters wanted. They're not going to water down the agenda.HANNITY: Is that going to be the Trump agenda?PRIEBUS: It's going to be the Trump agenda. He has the mandate. And so I want people to understand this isn't a matter of watering down our promises and forgetting about the will of the American people. The American people deserve the agenda of the Republican party because that is what they asked for.HANNITY: Let me ask you this. Have you spoken to Donald Trump Trump, or, you're right, president-elect Trump, have you spoken to with him about a position in his cabinet? It's been rumored you're being considered for chief of staff. Is that something you'd be interested in? I know you've gotten close to him over these many months. Would you want do that?PRIEBUS: That is not something I'm talking about. I think it's something that a lot of newspapers speculate about. I'm happy doing what I'm doing.HANNITY: Has he asked you if you would come on board?PRIEBUS: Um, I don't think he's doing a lot of that kind of talking.HANNITY: Why are you hedging? He did ask you. I'm sure he asked you.PRIEBUS: No. Listen, the job is to make sure we have a successful transition, that the teams get in place as quickly as possible. The inauguration is something that gets planned right now, and it's just not something people are talking about.HANNITY: All right, Reince Priebus, you deserve a big congratulations.  And I know you did get close with Mr. Trump in the course of this process.  And it's going to be very interesting in the next, certainly the first 100, 180 days he's in office. Thanks for joining us.PRIEBUS: That's right.HANNITY: And coming up, a very important ""Question of the Day."" And we need your help. That is next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: All right, time for our ""Question of the Day."" So what is the first thing you think president-elect Donald Trump should do as president?  Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you think. My answer is simple. Get rid of all of the executive orders hurting business and economic activity in the country. Maybe get rid of that Iranian deal. And then I'd start on just fulfilling every promise.  Anyway, that's my humble advice.Thanks for being with us. That's all the time we have left. We'll see you back here tomorrow night.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
