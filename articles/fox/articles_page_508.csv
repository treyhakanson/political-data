Hmm, I wonder if he could probably have said fewer things about certain things. But honestly, he's very happy with the way it's going.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, MSNBC)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I could probably have said fewer things about certain things. But honestly, I'm very happy with the way it's going.I never look back. I like to look forward. I like to learn from the past and I have learned.I can watch my words a little bit, maybe be a little more politically correct. But to be honest with you, I think one of the reasons I am doing well is because I don't want to -- being politically correct takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of effort. We don't have time in this country. Our country is really in trouble.(END VIDEO CLIP)He's right. Being politically correct is time-consuming, but being politically incorrect is not a cover for being crude.But Trump's a figure who can navigate both swamps of pop culture and politics. He's the first Republican to swim downstream from celebrity as a statesman. His power is that he can do ""Saturday Night Live"" in his sleep. His challenge, however is that we expect more when he's awake.So while I'm all for the skits, you can't be sketchy with world politics. Time for specifics. This race goes beyond an emotional high one gets from bold jabs on Twitter. Trump must put out, not put down.His old strategy, ""I won't show you my hand until I get the job,"" it's OK with groupies, but he wouldn't take that from a contractor, and we can't from a candidate, either. We already tried that, remember?So we need evidence that he's thinking of the big stuff in a practical manner. That means Islamic extremism, non-state terror, cyber terror, the changing demands of national security.As the world unravels, your standard for leadership shouldn't be, ""He's politically incorrect.""  It's, ""Can he persuade the rest of America that he can govern?"" Maybe that will be a skit.Greg Gutfeld currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The Greg Gutfeld Show (Saturdays 10-11PM/ET) and co-host of The Five (weekdays 5-6PM/ET).
