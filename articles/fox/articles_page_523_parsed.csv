NEIL CAVUTO, HOST:  Well, former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson was also the target of a lot of that name-calling, actually worse.  And he told me on FBN it was time for him to move on.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BILL RICHARDSON, D-FORMER NEW MEXICO GOVERNOR:  Well, you know, I popped up in a very insignificant way.John Podesta mentioned that Hillary Clinton should call me for an endorsement, and he referred to me as a needy Latino.  And I have said to you and to many of your viewers, most politicians are needy.But that was -- you know, that's inconsequential.  I think, right now, these are the closing arrangements.  It sounds like the Republicans and Trump, they're bringing all this personal, this negative stuff because they have no vision.  And their ground game is weak.CAVUTO:  Well, maybe so, maybe so, but he called you a word that rhymes with stick.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  And whether people agree or disagree with you, Governor, you're a gentleman, you're a patriot, you served your country well.  I think that's mean.  RICHARDSON:  Well, you're kind to say that.  But, no, it's somewhat -- he kind of tempered it a bit.CAVUTO:  No, he didn't.  (CROSSTALK)RICHARDSON:  He was trying to convince her.CAVUTO:  He said they should talk to you, they should calm you down, that better I think -- I'm paraphrasing here -- to have you on their side than against.  RICHARDSON:  Right.  Yes.  CAVUTO:  You had patched up your differences with the Clintons.  They were mad at you in 2008 for supporting Barack Obama.  RICHARDSON:  Right.  CAVUTO:  But you got over that.  But I don't know.  I mean, you have done more than enough to help out Hillary Clinton.  RICHARDSON:  It was a political -- it was a political -- that is a locker room political talk.  (CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  Yes, isn't that killer, right?  Isn't that a killer, Governor? They criticize some of the language that Donald Trump sues.RICHARDSON:  No, no, no.  CAVUTO:  And they're saying of you a word that rhymes with stick.  (CROSSTALK)RICHARDSON:  And they got the objective.  She did -- she did call me.  She did call me.CAVUTO:  And what did she say?RICHARDSON:  We patched things up.  She said that: ""I'm glad we're coming back together.  And let's work together.""And I have done that.  I have campaigned for her and volunteer.CAVUTO:  Have you heard since the revelations of these e-mails from anyone in the campaign?RICHARDSON:  Yes.  Yes.  CAVUTO:  Governor, we're sorry?RICHARDSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes, they have.  Yes, yes, I have.  I have.  I'm not going to get into that.CAVUTO:  What have they said?  Has Podesta called you?(CROSSTALK)RICHARDSON:  But I think -- well, we were in touch, yes, and because we're old friends, Neil.  CAVUTO:  Really?RICHARDSON:  He was chief of staff under Bill Clinton.CAVUTO:  Governor, I have old friends.  RICHARDSON:  Absolutely.  I have known him for 30 years.  CAVUTO:  I never refer to my old friends that way.  Well, maybe sometimes.(LAUGHTER)RICHARDSON:  Well, quietly, privately, I bet you do, but anyway.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  So, you're not -- bygones are bygones.  You're not going to make a big deal of it, because here's what I get out of these, Governor.  RICHARDSON:  Of course not.CAVUTO:  You know all the players far better than I.But I get a sense of a lot of condescending dismissiveness at the campaign, even Podesta for Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton for a lot of other people.  It just gives me an icky feeling.  It's not a Republican or Democratic feeling.  It's just sort of like bad people feeling.  What do you think?  RICHARDSON:  Well, look, Neil, let's compare what Trump says about other people, about other politicians.  (CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  No, no, no, see, you're shifting.  And you're not a shifter.   You're not a shifter.  RICHARDSON:  No, no, no, look, this is politics.  This is what happens when campaigns -- they're intensely pressurized.  They get very personal.And I think we should stop focusing on WikiLeaks.  Stop.  Look at the issues.  What are the next three days, the closing arguments?(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  If we didn't have WikiLeaks, we wouldn't know about any of this. I'm not endorsing the way it came to our attention, but it is out there. And I -- when I hear people referring to you in this manner, I don't like it.RICHARDSON:  You know, we should ask, why is Russia interfering?  They're responsible, with Julian Assange, for these WikiLeaks.  Why don't we talk about that?CAVUTO:  Oh, well, they're a bunch of sticks.  They are -- don't even get me going.  They're a bunch of sticks.  (END VIDEOTAPE)CAVUTO:  All right, well, see what a gentleman he is?  And he had been royally sticked.  Stick wasn't the word they used.  All right.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Isn't it too bad that we don't have stronger leadership on both sides, on both sides? I mean, you know, you have people that can't fix the budget but then they start talking about their nominee, but they can't fix the budget. Isn't it really sad that we don't have stronger leadership on both sides?MIKE PENCE, REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Republican leaders here in Iowa, all across America are standing with the Trump/Pence team, and we're honored by that. But I really do believe that Republican leaders should join millions of Americans and support the Republican nominee for president.REP. LOUIE GOHMERT, R-TEXAS: This garbage some have muttered about, it's so important we keep the majority in the House so that we can keep Hillary in check, my gosh, Stuart, did you see how well we kept Obama in check?(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Well, today was a lot about Republicans. The GOP nominee tweeting out starting this morning, lots of tweets, but here's just a few of them. ""Despite winning the second debate in a landslide, every poll, it's hard to well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support."" Next one, ""Our very weak, ineffective leader Paul Ryan had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty. It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off of me and I can now fight for America the way I want to. With the exception of cheating Bernie out of the nomination, the Democrats have always proven to be far more loyal to each other than the Republicans. Disloyal R's are far more difficult than crooked Hillary. They come at you from all sides. They don't know how to win. I will teach them. The very foul-mouthed Senator John McCain begged for my support during his primary. I gave. He won. Then he dropped me over locker room remarks.""Paul Ryan through a spokesman issued a statement saying, ""Paul Ryan is focusing on the next month on defeating Democrats, and all Republicans running for office should probably do the same."" That's what today's news from the campaign trail was.Let's bring in our panel: Steve Hayes, senior writer for The Weekly Standard; A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics, and Monica Crowley, editor and columnist for The Washington Times.People have long said, Monica, that there may be a civil war within the Republican Party and others blow it off. I mean, this is here.MONICA CROWLEY, THE WASHINGTON TIMES: Yes.BAIER: It's reality.CROWLEY: It is real, yes. And Donald Trump is fighting back.Look, because Donald Trump represents an existential threat to the bipartisan ruling class, that means that he's fighting a multi-front war, so he's taking incoming from the president, the White House, Mrs. Clinton, her campaign, the Democratic Party, the Republican establishment, and the media. If he wins this race, it will be a straight-up miracle.I think, though, that what he's doing here in terms of fighting back, this is why you have surrogates. The Republican nominee for president should not be punching down. He should not even be taking on these fights. That's what his surrogates are for.I think he would have been better served to take the opposite approach and say, look, when I am elected president, I'm going to need Republican majorities in the House, so vote for these candidates. Even if you don't like me, vote for them. If he reverses the narrative and reaches out to Paul Ryan, reaches out to these Republican candidates, you know, it could have a potentially good payoff for him down the road. That's what an effective leader would do.BAIER: A.B., I tell you, it was kind of baffling as you looked at all of the tweets. There really wasn't a lot of anti-Hillary Clinton campaign tweets. There was one late in the day. We'll talk about in the next panel. What about this, and how does the RNC go about knocking on doors to get people out to vote for Donald Trump and representative from this district?A.B. STODDARD, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: Yes, that is really -- that's the key. I mean, he's fighting a primary campaign. He loves to fight the primary campaign. It's what he always reverts to when he's not teleprompter Trump and under Kellyanne Conway's strict rules. He is now off the teleprompter and out of his shackles and nothing left to lose mode.But this is a man with a pitiful presence on the ground in terms of what 2016 national presidential political campaign mechanics are supposed to look like. Terrible anecdotes from around the battlegrounds where there's just not enough of an operation. If you are going to disconnect and divorce yourself from the party that way, it really makes a material difference, precinct by precinct, county by county, with enthusiasm, resources, whether or not your name is included on the call sheet when they make the call or when they knock on the door and give the speech about, you know, councilman so-and-so. Is Donald Trump being promoted by the party? If he disconnects from the party, it's between one and I don't know how many percentage points, but it absolutely makes a difference. He's just a man on his own now.BAIER: We are one month away, Steve, and you talk about the balance of power. You look at the Senate. It's a thin majority, if you look at the races that are on the board, for Republicans. And there you see it on the board, 54-46, 44 Democrats, two independents that caucus with the Democrats. You know, they could lose it as of tonight. But the House, the House actually may be in play. Some pollsters are saying some of those races are going the other way.STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Yes, if the polls today -- if the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll has Hillary plus nine, is the result on Election Day, I think you're looking at a loss of the House for Republicans.BAIER: So they shifted to plus-seven today with the post-debate stuff, but still, even at plus-seven.HAYES: The plus nine I think was the two-way. But either way you're talking about a blowout for Democrats and potential of the Republicans losing the House, which is why it makes so little sense tactically for Donald Trump to be attacking Paul Ryan, who hasn't, by the way, unendorsed Donald Trump. Ryan is getting a lot of heat. It's not that you just have loud conservatives on one side and others, anti-establishment types, criticizing Paul Ryan for not fully supporting Donald Trump. You have a lot of people on the other side saying you need to walk away from Donald Trump. This is a disaster. If it's a cancer, you need to cut it out right now. And Ryan is trying to live in the middle of those two camps.I mean, in a way, it's sort of fitting, 28 days out from the general election, Donald Trump, who was a Democrat when he was younger, spent most of his life as a Democrat, has attacked Republicans throughout his career, it's sort of fitting if he spends the last month attacking Republicans. But it won't get him a win.BAIER: A on the Democratic side, you had Hillary Clinton today campaigning with Al Gore in Florida, former Democratic nominee. He was making, Monica, a couple of points, one, the environmental, climate change point, but also in Florida, especially for him, make sure that you don't vote for the Ralph Nader types because it can cost you an election. Obviously he lost in 2000.CROWLEY: Yes, his presence there with Mrs. Clinton is about two things -- the crucial battleground of Florida because if Trump loses Florida, he loses the election. And secondly, it's about Mrs. Clinton's outreach to millennials, because when you talked about Ralph Nader, of course, they're obsessed with climate change as an issue. Al Gore is the main cheerleader for that issue.But more importantly all the recent polling shows about 60 percent, 65 percent of millennial voters would consider a third party, whether that's Jill Stein or Gary Johnson or somebody else. So Mrs. Clinton is trying to lock down that age group and make sure they come out for her.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

8	8	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/01/14/bill-oreilly-my-state-union-message-to-president/	Bill O'Reilly: My State of the Union message to the President	"Very long speech last night by Mr. Obama; very political -- not much substance. Few statements caught my attention. The President sensitive to charges that he has misused American power, basically retreating from evil.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: The United States of America is the most powerful nation on earth - - period. Period. It's not even close.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Sure, but what good is having strength if you're unwilling to use it wisely? Look, everybody knows that ISIS is causing a massive amount of trouble in the world. Everybody knows that -- millions of refugees, the collapse of Iraq, human rights violations daily and on and on. But Mr. Obama has not neutralized the jihad, ISIS. In fact, it's become stronger since he has been in office. No question about that.Now, the solution is to compel NATO to fight ISIS directly and at the same time set up safe zones for the suffering people of Syria. That's the solution. Many Muslim nations would assist if NATO were mobilized. So why haven't you done that, Mr. President?Sadly, the President used a part of his speech last night to politic.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: That's why we need to reject any politics, any politics that targets people because of race or religion.The world respects us not just for our arsenal. It respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Fine, swell, no problem -- but many in the world don't respect us. Again, the fact is that most of the terror violence in the world comes out of the Muslim precincts. So instead of taking a shot at Trump, why not address that in a meaningful way, Mr. President?Finally, prosperity. It simply has not happened on President Obama's watch. More than half of all working Americans now make less than $30,000 a year -- about half.That's because corporate America is not bullish on Mr. Obama's high tax and spend agenda. Companies are not expanding the way they must in order to create well-paying jobs. Instead they are penny pinching and workers have little leverage. All that is apparently lost on the President who instead, puts economics into the political arena.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: The future we want, all of us want, opportunity and security for our families, a rising standard of living, a sustainable peaceful planet for our kids -- all of that is within our reach. But it will only happen if we work together.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Not quite. An aggressive push to stimulate the private marketplace by making it easier for companies to make money is the way to create opportunity and security for American workers in order to help the kids.Summing up, another windy political speech by the President that did not even come close to addressing the latest Gallup poll finding that 76 percent of Americans are dissatisfied with the way things are going.And that's ""The Memo"".Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I will appoint a secretary of Veterans Affairs who will make it his or her personal mission to clean up the V.A. And this will be a person of great competence. This will not be a political hack.Our debt to them is eternal and everlasting. We are going to fight for our military and our law enforcement personnel the same way they have fought for us.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Donald Trump in Virginia Beach today as he narrows in on his vice presidential choice. Some names that are on that list, we have Newt Gingrich, former House speaker, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, former head of the DIA. Those three said to be on a narrow list. Then you have Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, and Governor Mary Fallin of Oklahoma.This as the race, you can see the RCP average is now, the Real Clear Politics average of polls, Clinton by four-and-a-half in the average of recent polls. With that, let's bring in the panel: Here in New York, Jason Riley, columnist with the Wall Street Journal; Monica Crowley, editor and columnist for The Washington Times, and Philip Bump of the Washington Post.OK, Monica, what do you think? It sounds like we're going to have a couple days here, and then there's going to be an announcement.MONICA CROWLEY, THE WASHINGTON TIMES: Yes, Donald Trump is now considering those six, and I think -- I think that there's enough excitement with Donald Trump at the top of the ticket that he can afford to choose somebody who is perhaps a little less exciting in that term. I would say that Donald Trump is --BAIER: So now you're pointing to like a Mike Pence?CROWLEY: Yes, exactly, because, look, Donald Trump is a consummate showman. So he knows how to build suspense. And that's exactly what he's doing here by floating these names. It's possible that he could choose none of the above and surprise us all with a choice.But I do think his choice matters this time with him more than probably any previous Republican candidate in recent memory simply because he's never done this before. And I would think he's going to accomplish two things. One is that he's already offered a lot of voters hope that if they elect him there will be true change, that the status quo will in fact be smashed. But he also now needs to offer voters reassurance in addition to that hope, reassurance that he will in fact govern responsibly.The second point, which is directly related to that one, is that I think he needs to choose somebody who will in fact help him govern responsibly, somebody who has done this before who knows what they're doing.BAIER: Something that he has pointed out in numerous interviews, Jason.JASON RILEY, WALL STREET JOURNAL: I was going to say, a number of people on the list would make good vice presidents, including Pence and Gingrich. The question is whether they help him get elected in November. And there I'm not so sure. Both men have experience. They know the policies inside and out. They have credibility with conservatives, but are they going to help Donald Trump with the Democratic groups with which he's struggling right now -- young people, women, minorities, and so forth? And I think there's the problem.BAIER: Philip, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, a lot of people don't know who he is. He was on the Sunday shows this weekend. He's a registered Democrat and he was asked about his feeling on abortion. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LT. GEN. MICHAEL FLYNN: Abortion, I think it's a -- I think for women, and these are difficult issues, but I think women have to be able to choose what they -- you know, sort of the right of choice. But I think that's a difficult legal decision that -- and I think that women are so important in that decision making process.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Well, today, he told our Jennifer Griffin on the phone this, that he's a pro-life Democrat. ""The pro-choice issue is a legal issue that should be decided by the courts. I believe in law. If people want to change the law, they should vote so that we can appoint pro-life judges. I believe the law should be changed. If people are going to decide the election on just this election, then they should just stay home. This is a legal issue. We have bigger problems,"" saying national security trumps all. Your thoughts?PHILIP BUMP, WASHINGTON POST: Our Robert Costa has done great work in tracking where Trump is, now thinks that Flynn, Flynn has sort of emerged in the wake of Dallas as being someone who could be strong in national strong, seen as a strong hand. He is now declined to some extent. I'm sure that didn't help. The immediately reaction from conservatives was quite understandably frustration with the idea that Trump might pick someone who is not as strong on choice as they would like.To the point that we just made around appealing to Democrats, that is the only place where this seems like it might be helpful to Trump beyond national security is having someone who can be more moderate, more in the middle. I'm just not sure that's the issue that will keep Republicans in line with Trump and actually broaden his base.BAIER: I want to turn Hillary Clinton. She was on CNN and said this about the e-mail investigation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I am certainly relieved and glad that the investigation has concluded. But I also know how important it is to make sure everybody understands that I would certainly not do that again. That is something that at the time, as even Director Comey said, seemed like a convenience, but it was the wrong choice.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Well, wrong choice, but this is how the polls show this. ABC/Washington Post, FBI's decision not to charge Clinton, approve, 35 percent, disapprove, 56 percent. Does it make you worry what she would do if elected president as a result of that? Worried, 57 percent, not related, 39 percent. There's the next one, there you go. And outcome of this issue change the likelihood of supporting Clinton, and there you see the breakdown, more likely, 10 percent, less likely, 28 percent, no difference, 58 percent.But the big one, I guess, there is the decision not to charge, Monica, 56 percent say it was the wrong decision.CROWLEY: It was a mistake. Yes, I think the American people understand and know crime and corruption when they see it. And Director Comey laying out the entire case against her, which was pretty powerful and pretty devastating against Mrs. Clinton, only to turn around and say, but we are declining to recommend charges, I think the American people see an enormous disconnect between what they know she has done and the FBI's decision.And there's a broader point here. There's a bigger disconnect, which is playing into the full election. And it's actually sweeping the western world, which is this fundamental disconnect between the global elites and here in the U.S., I mean the bipartisan ruling class, and everybody else. And what they're seeing, which is something the Clintons have ridden on for a very long time, is that they are somehow above the rules. They're too good for the rule of law, and this decision simply reinforces that.CLINTON: The politics of this, I mean, she's obviously going to be tried in the court of public opinion, Jason, but Democrats will tell you, when is the investigation over? When they say no charges, when the Benghazi report comes out? They say this is it, right? They want it to be over. So is it over?RILEY: I don't think it's up to them whether it's over. And based on the poll, a lot of Americans don't think it should be over.Speaking of politics, though, I think Donald Trump has detected a big opening here. Playing off this poll, he's giving speeches about how he's the law and order candidate, which I think speaks not only to this issue but also to the shootings in Dallas and so forth. Sort of reminiscent of Richard Nixon back in 1968. People see chaos, out there they want sanity brought to bear, and I'm the guy who will do that. So I think Trump sees a big opening here, and wisely so.BAIER: Philip?BUMP: I would just note there's one key point here, which I think we're seeing Sanders underlying this. And 37 percent of Democrats agreed with the idea it was a mistake not to charge Hillary Clinton, which is a very large number for Democrats. I think part of that, a lot of Bernie Sanders fans and maybe Bernie Sanders himself saw that as being their gateway to getting the nomination at the convention. Once that door closed, I think there is still some resentment there.I think we should also focus on that 60 percent, one of the things about Benghazi and the e-mail issue that we've seen is not a lot of partisans moving or switching sides based on this. A lot of this is baked in. I'm just not sure there's a lot of repercussion.BAIER: And Bernie Sanders officially endorsing tomorrow.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.
