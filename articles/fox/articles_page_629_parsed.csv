This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Hillary, that's not a president. She is not taking us -- everything that's been involved in Hillary has been losses. You take a look. Even her race with Obama she got schlonged. She lost. I mean, she lost.HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You are looking at somebody who has had a lot of terrible things said about me, and I am well aware of the fact it's really easy to do that. And you just say it and send it around the world. And luckily I'm old enough that it doesn't particularly bother me.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHANNON BREAM, GUEST ANCHOR: We are back with our panel. And we're talking about the two frontrunners currently in the 2016 race. Of course, Donald Trump in the newest Quinnipiac poll today stands atop the field at 28 percent. But Cruz is closing in at 24 percent, followed further down by Rubio and Carson in double digits. So, Charles, do you want to take a stab at that first? Choose your words carefully.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Yes, I know. I know I'm the ethnic expert on that word, but I will eschew the opportunity to comment on that cultural appropriation of the vulgar yiddishism, except to say I have heard it in other contexts, but almost always in schoolyards. I have never heard it in a presidential campaign. But that's Donald Trump for you.Look, can anybody predict what affect it's going to have on his numbers? No, except that it will likely have a positive effect. You never know. But if the Quinnipiac poll is not an outlier, it shows that his numbers come back to where he had been, high 20s and Cruz on his tail. And I think it looks on -- Trump himself said earlier, I think it was yesterday, that it looks like it could be a two-man race. I think the other possibilities, outsiders, are Rubio, maybe Christie. But if that's what it comes down to, I don't think anybody has it wrapped up.BREAM: Yes. I mean, there seems like there is a lot of room for movement here because if you look at the candidate of choice poll that we have also from Quinnipiac, whether folks have made up their mind or they might change, there is a lot of potential movement there because 63 percent of Trump's followers say they have made up their mind but 36 percent say they could change, and the reverse is true for Cruz. So there is still, Ron, a lot of movement there weeks out from the first official vote.RON FOURNIER, NATIONAL JOURNAL: We have no idea who is going to the win the nomination. We have no idea who is going to be the president. But we do know the impact Donald Trump has already had on this race. We all worry about the coarsening of our culture, something we talk about with our kids and talk about with our family and talk about with our colleagues. We know that the culture is getting coarsening in a way that is really undermining society.And here we have a guy who is talking about using that kind of a language with a presidential candidate, who talks about Mexicans in a very disparaging way, who is now putting into the public sphere the kind of language and the kind of thoughts that we kept to ourselves if we had them at all. And if nothing else, win or lose, that is the very detrimental, grim legacy that he is leaving in this campaign.BAIER: George, others will say that it's drawing people in, his passion and his excitement and these crowds drawing people in who weren't into politics before. We hear the anecdotal stories people wills say, my neighbor is now involved or my parents are now involved because they like Trump so much and they want to get involved. They are kind of swept up.GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Let's see if they are actually in politics. Let's see if they actually show up in the Iowa caucuses at night in a church basement and do all the things they have to do. I'm skeptical.What I liked about the Quinnipiac poll that struck me as interesting is between them Cruz and Trump have 52 percent right now. The standard narrative has been that there would a conservative Tea Party type insurgent and the establishment type. Neither Cruz nor Trump qualifies as an establishment type. I don't want to libel poor Marco Rubio by calling him that, but he is as close as they come, and he is at 12 percent.So they are running very different kinds of campaigns. Cruz is running a very granular, on the ground, 17 counties in Nevada, 17 county chairmen, 99 in Iowa, same thing. Trump is surfing on a wave of free media. And Marco Rubio is campaigning largely through this news channel here. I think I saw three of his PAC commercials on this today when he announced his candidacy, I believe it was at 6 p.m. Eastern Time, and it was carried by ""Special Report."" So they know how to reach the core of the Republican nominating electorate right through this channel, and we're going to see whether it works with Trump or with Rubio, or whether you still have to do the more granular politics that Cruz is trying.KRAUTHAMMER: There is one number here that strikes me. You ask the supporters of Trump and Cruz is your mind made up? There is a huge difference. With Trump it's 63 percent, with Cruz 36. That means two thirds of Trump support is fixed. I think he is the only Republican candidate of whom you can say he has followers, not supporters. I can't see people saying that George -- that Jeb Bush has followers. He has followers. He has a constituency that I think is not going to leave him. That means if he is at 27 percent, two thirds are made up. He has a fixed constituency of 18 percent, which is, you know, that's a hell of a floor. Nobody is anywhere near that. So he is going to be a factor one way or the other.But, the fact that the vote is split, and there is about 80 percent of the vote, 70 percent of the vote that is non-Trump, means that the idea that he is going to sweep in I think is a little bit premature.BREAM: Well, let's look really quickly at the head-to-head general election matchup, too, because in this poll Clinton beats Trump by seven percent. I think Rubio and Cruz were a little bit closer, but she is still doing well head to head, Ron.FOURNIER: Again, I'm not going to predict who is going to win this thing, but there's no doubt that Donald Trump would be the easiest candidate for her to run against. Just look at the numbers. His disapproval rating is much higher than even hers in the general electorate.And I think we are making a good point here with Trump. If you are going to run that free media kind of campaign, the hardest place to do it is in Iowa where do you have to get people to come out on a cold Sunday, stand in a community center or church basement.BREAM: For hours.FOURNIER: And announce out loud your vote and then defend it. New Hampshire, the next race is really informed by Iowa. So it's not until you get to South Carolina where you get a really clean hit for Trump. So there is a long way to go here yet.BREAM: There is. We will watch every twist and turn. Thank you, panel.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Eric Bolling with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Jedediah Bila and Tom Shillue. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""Donald Trump is under fire once again for speaking his mind this time for expressing concerns about the ancestry of a federal judge presiding over Trump University lawsuit. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I've been treated very unfairly before him. We had another judge. If that judge was still there, this case would have been over two years ago. Let me just tell you, I have had horrible rulings, I've been treated very unfairly by this judge. Now, this judge is of Mexican heritage. I'm building a wall, OK? I'm building a wall. I'm going to do very well with the Hispanics, the Mexicans --JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: So no Mexican judge could ever be involved in a case that involves you?TRUMP: Well, now he's a member of the society where, you know, for pro- Mexico and that's fine. It's all fine, but I think --TAPPER: Except that you're calling into question his heritage.TRUMP: I think he should recuse himself.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: The U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel was born in Indiana to Mexican parents. Now Trump is taking a lot of heat from the left, but even some of his supporters like Newt Gingrich thinks he shouldn't singling out the judge ethnicity.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: This is one of the worst mistakes Trump has made. I mean, I think it's inexcusable. He has every right to criticize a judge and he has every right to say certain decisions are right, and his attorneys can file to move the venue from the judge. But first of all, this judge was born in Indiana. He is an American, period.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Now this morning on Fox News, Trump said he was surprised by Gingrich's take, calling this comments inappropriate. The presumptive GOP nominee defends his position on the ""O'Reilly Factor"" tonight, and we have a preview clip.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL O'REILLY, ""THE O'REILLY FACTOR"" HOST: But do you regret making it personal with the judge?TRUMP: Look, I have had very, very unfair decisions. People said, this should have gone away a long time ago and some were judgment. I don't care if the judge is Mexican or not. I'm gonna do great with the Mexican people because I provide jobs. So I don't care about Mexican, but we are being treated very unfairly, Bill, very, very unfairly.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right, we're bringing around our legal expert here. Now, now, Kimberly, he -- Donald Trump has a right to say he feels he's being treated unfairly by this judge .KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Correct.BOLLING: . and could push back against the judge, but the issue being he called out his ethnicity, and that's the problem. On that clip you hear tonight, you are going to hear tonight on O'Reilly, he (inaudible) of touch a little bit.GUILFOYLE: He (inaudible) of touch. He said he didn't care regardless, you know, about the ethnicity of the judge, but he does care about being treated unfairly and that's where it should have began and ended to begin with. Meaning, he should just have said that if that's how he felt. And I also just think like, don't waste even a moment of opportunity to be attacking Hillary Clinton, the e-mail server situation, the Clinton Foundation, the investigations that are ongoing like what Bernie Sanders is doing, really focusing and honing in on that. That's what he should be using his valuable airtime for. So I think, at this point, you move off of this, let your lawyers handle it. Let them file a motion, you know, to recuse the judge if you feel that there is, you know, some kind of substance of evidence to suggest that there, you know, he's being treated unfairly or the judge would be bias of prejudice against him. There are motions for that.BOLLING: So Juan, all throughout the weekend, the talk shows were all over Donald Trump about this comment, but it's not, really not about Trump University. I mean, do you think they -- the left cares about Trump University, or did they care that Donald Trump mentioned Mexico or something Mexican, and then they blow it up and see if they can make out of it.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, I don't think it's the left that's really hammering Donald Trump on this effectively. Right now, it's the fact that you have Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, Newt Gingrich, as you just saw, saying this is identity politics. This is not the way republican conservatives play ball. We don't go and say to people, oh, Clarence Thomas can't make a decision because he's black guy or Chief Justice Robert shouldn't be ruling on an abortion case because he's a Catholic. That's identity politics. And I think what you heard from Kimberly, as an officer of the court is, that's not the way, we, as Americans play ball. Like this is a very disturbing kind of attack. I mean we suggest that we, as Americans can't treat each other fairly without regard to race or ethnicity.BOLLING: So Jedediah, let me just throw this out here. Now this judge born in Indiana to Mexican parents, he was part -- by the way, fought the Mexican drug cartels, just a tough guy; a great judge. But was part of its society, a legal society called San Diego La Raza Law Society. Is it possible that Trump misconstrued that La Raza part, being part of that big .JEDEDIAH BILA, GUEST CO-HOST: Yeah.BOLLING: . race group on the west coast that is so anti-American?BILA: Yeah, I think he did confuse it. And the problem is that now I'm getting tweets. Everyone is getting tweets that, oh, this guy is a part of the national council of La Raza, which is a completely different thing. So that's another issue with Trump, through. You can't throw stuff like that out there unless you, unless you have some sort of proof, because it's misleading to the public. I don't like the implication here. And the implication to me was, that if you have parents or family members that are of Mexican heritage, that's somehow you don't support border security, that's somehow you don't support the law. And that's what I think he was trying to say in somewhere were that this guy would somehow be opposed to border security because of his ethnicity. I think, Juan, honestly, you hit the nail on the head, because conservatives have been fighting against any politics for a long time. This is what the left does. They isolate people based on your gender, based on, you know, let's cater to women. Let's cater to this group of people, and conservatives are always saying, ""No, we are all people, and regardless of your ethnicity, if you care about freedom, then you care that we can all come together and support that."" So I have a real problem with he said here. I don't think that you can defend it. And I think if he, if he were under the impression of this with La Raza and would somehow biased, he should have done his research. You are running for president. You are leading in the polls. You have a great opportunity to set an example for everyone, and this is not doing that.BOLLING: Tom?TOM SHILLUE, GUEST CO-HOST: I agree. But you, you're right Jedediah. This is what democrats do. You know, I think it's politically dumb for Trump to fight this fight. I think it's politically dumb for him to talk about Trump University at all, because, you know, it's a non-issue for most Americans. They don't care about his personal, you know, problems with the law. We care about America. So he has to get back to make America great again, but identity politics is what the democrats do. I mean, you can see fund- raisers from the DNC, and they talked about Hispanic-American have to unite against Trump. They are saying that people should vote a certain way or think a certain way, because of their ethnicity. So Trumps doing nothing different than the DNC does every day.BILA: But he should be above that, as the argument. You can't be --SHILLUE: I agree.BILA: As a conservative, you can't say this is the problem with by our political system works of you, because you stoop to that low level. I'm gonna come in and stoop to that level. So he should be above it. He should be --SHILLUE: But the press is -- they're huffing and puffing. Is it --(CROSSTALK)SHILLUE: Look, this is proof that Trump is a racist. It just proof that Trump is playing identity politics, which happens all the time.BOLLING: Or KG -- is he playing identity politics or is he defending against the, the identity politics? I mean, the left is -- all right, fair enough. Left and certain parts of the right are going after Donald Trump for the comment. But I don't know, you saw that clip right there. It seems like he said, I don't care if he's Mexican or not.GUILFOYLE: Right. Well --BOLLING: I want a fair trial.GUILFOYLE: You know what it sounds like? It sounds like he took a good opportunity to reach a huge audience and he went on, you know, to do an interview to with O'Reilly, that will air tonight, and I think we haven't seen the whole clip, the whole interview, so let's see. But it sounds like he is on the right track, because when you have people even like Newt Gingrich who, you know, I interview when I was in Greta on Friday, he was very upset about it, and he saw that clip earlier. There are a lot of people on the right that are supporters of Trump that just feel like, whoa, and my whole point is listen, he's really good at going on the attack. Focus on Hillary Clinton, like, eyes on the target.BOLLING: All right, Juan, hang in here. I want to -- you just hear this clip here. Not everyone thinks Trump was wrong to question whether he's being treated fairly. Here's former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ALBERTO GONZALES, FORMER UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: It's perfectly legitimate to ask the question. And I think the judge, as every judge should do before every case to consider all the facts, to consider the publicity about the case was being said publicly about the case, and make a decision. Again, it's not just about being impartial. It's about the appearance of impartiality and priority. That's the standard that the judge must satisfy.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right now, Gonzales clarified, he said he is not supporting Trump's comments, but he has the right to a fair trial and impartial judge right.WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: That's kind of what Trump was saying, right?GUILFOYLE: At the law.WILLIAMS: No, I don't think that's what Trump was saying, because if there was any evidence of impartiality, as Kimberly was saying earlier, his lawyers could bring some action to say this judge --GUILFOYLE: A motion to recuse.WILLIAMS: Right. The motion to recuse to say this judge has acted improperly or with bias. That's not the case. He said, ""I'm building a wall and this guy has Mexican heritage."" That's the basis his argument against the judge.BOLLING: Let's talk a little politics. Bring it around the table. Does this affect long term? Does this affect Donald Trump's popularity, his polling, his fight against Hillary?SHILLUE: No, because nothing does. But he should get off the Trump University stuff as soon as possible, because that's going to hurt him, because it's just not an issue that we care about. We don't care about Trump University.BOLLING: Agree?BILA: I think it does affect him. He -- I mean, does this guy want to win? If he wants to win, he needs Hispanics, he needs women. He needs to watch what he says. He's now in the lead, but you make comments like this, you're giving Hillary Clinton, her campaign material. You are giving her video right now. Why would you do that when she's so ineffective and you have so much to rail against? This is a waste of everyone's time and it hurts them.BOLLING: Juanito?WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think it hurts him with independence, but it hurts him with like, republicans. I mean, I think there are a lot of republicans who are trying to unify, trying to get behind him and who are like, wait a second, why is he doing this? You know, this is a different state. This is a moment when you should be bringing a party together, enlarging his reputation as a reasonable person rather than maybe the rash guy who needed to stand out among 17 contenders for the GOP nomination. Instead, he's spending time in blue states that the republican leadership doesn't think he has a chance to win, so they don't understand the strategy. And then he's saying these things that really drive away Latino voters, but also drive away, you know, what Jedediah was saying, independents and women that he need so critically. So when he was asked by Tapper by the way, Tapper said to him, ""You're saying this man can't do his job because of his race. Isn't that the definition of racism?"" Well, Trump says, ""No, not quite."" But that's what he's saying. The man can't do his job because of his race.BOLLING: KG?GUILFOYLE: Well, he has the ability and right to be able to question bias and prejudice, to say. And he does, the law is you have the right to a fair trial and by an impartial judge and jury of your peers if it goes to a trial type of situation, right? So that's the standard in this country. But again, I think at this point, like, move on. Let's not speak of it again, meaning that's what his campaign and he should be doing. Just leave it alone, like put up total, you know, wipe out .BOLLING: Yeah, yeah.GUILFOYLE: . blank slate on Trump University.BOLLING: And I'm going to agree with that.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: I'm gonna second that thought. And -- I'm sure Donald Trump right now is going, OK, let's get through this. We'll work this out and we just get back on to the things that matter; jobs, the economy, because at the end of the day, that's what will actually get the Latino vote as the strong economy. All right, we'll leave it right there. Hillary Clinton was asked a simple question over the weekend. Does she believe Americans have the constitutional right to bear arms? Now, we know the answer, but please stay tuned for her answer. So prepare yourself. That's next on ""The Five.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: For the good one. Donald Trump has been issuing the warnings, if Hillary Clinton is president; she's coming after your guns.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We are going to save our Second Amendment; Hillary Clinton wants to abolish it, believe me. She wants to abolish our Second Amendment. We are going to save our Second Amendment.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Well, is he right? It might not be a stretch, because Clinton can't even pull herself to admit that the right to bear arms is in the constitution.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Do you believe that an individual's right to bear arms is a constitutional right that it's not linked to service in a militia?HILLARY CLINTON, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: For most of our history, there was a nuanced reading of the Second Amendment until the decision by the late Justice Scalia, and there was no argument until then that localities and states and the federal government had a right, as we do with every amendment, to impose reasonable regulations. So I believe we can have common-sense gun safety measures consistent with the Second Amendment.STEPHANOPOULOS: But that's not what I asked, I said, do you believe that their conclusion that an individual's right to bear arms is a constitutional right?CLINTON: If it is a constitutional right, then it, like every other constitutional right is subject to reasonable regulations.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right. So listen, the big (ph) campaign, they're one of them, from Donald Trump, and of course, in getting that the early, important NRA endorsement is, Hillary Clinton wants your guns. A gun grab is coming to America if she's the next president of the United States. Strong message, what do you think?BOLLING: So you don't want to keep in my pocket, right?GUILFOYLE: I do.BOLLING: Pocket constitution. Now this is not -- first of all, let me just said, it's been hard on George Stephanopoulos in the past, because he used to work for Clintons. He was a communications director for the Clintons, and I said, maybe he should be in the seat asking the questions. Give him credit. That was a good follow up questions, because he stayed with it, didn't let her get away with the first answer. He said, ""But you didn't answer my question. Is the right to bear arms, Second Amendment, is it protected in the constitution?"" She dodged the question. So, as the question is or should be. He asked her specifically, she couldn't answer. It is 27 words. The Second Amendment to the constitution is 27 words, a hundred and forty-four characters, which means, it's almost the length of a tweet. It says, ""A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."" It's not hard. It's very specific. It is a right. It's a constitutionally protected right. If you want to be president, Hillary, and change the constitution, knock yourself and out try, but at least admit, it's a protected right, the way the question was asked.GUILFOYLE: So this is the type of thing, Jedediah, that this we should focusing on. On issues like this, you can really motivate and pull people out enthusiasm in the party to get people to come out to the polls.BILA: That's true. And she's not dumb. We can all acknowledge she's not an idiot. She's just a coward. She's afraid to say that, because if she comes out and says, yes, absolutely it's a constitutional right. And the left- wing base, many of which by the way, are voting for Bernie Sanders and can't stand her and will going to say, oh, what is she talking about? She's going to be a gun girl. She's gonna go after and protect the gun. This was a really good example of what Hillary Clinton is, though. She's a coward and she also -- she comes off like she stands for nothing all the time. I've heard so contradictory statements. She is in the moment what she thinks you want her to be in the moment. You're absolutely right, though. Republican should feast on statements like this and say look, this is who you want to vote for? Somebody who can't, clearly, as Eric just did articulate. This is an easy question Hillary, the answer is yes. Move on.SHILLUE: Exactly. You know what I keep in my pocket?(CROSSTALK)SHILLUE: Dental floss.(LAUGHTER)SHILLUE: But I also believe in --GUILFOYLE: Good you have it around.(LAUGHTER)SHILLUE: I also believe in the Second Amendment. Look, I looked up the CNN's for infringe. She'll not be restricted. She'll not be limited. She'll not be weakened. She'll not be diminished. It's very simple, I mean, people always said, well, there's a lot of nuance to this. It really isn't.BILA: There isn't.GUILFOYLE: So if only she had a good thesaurus, maybe she's make a chance on.WILLIAMS: I think you heard a lot of nuance to it and that's why it wasn't until Justice Scalia ruled in Heller case, that you didn't have the Supreme Court of her individual rights to own a weapon. But let's get back] to what Jedediah was saying. I think you are exactly right. She's playing games, because she didn't want to say explicitly, yes, people have a right to own a gun. But what she had said all along is this is about the right of states and localities to have background checks, waiting periods, on-line, closing the gun show loophole on-line. So she wants to protect that and emphasize that as her political message. I don't think that's an act of coward is. I think that's political smart.BOLLING: That's not what she asked, though.WILLIAMS: But I, I agree with you. She was asked specifically about affirming the right of the Second -- by the way, I say --BOLLING: Twice.WILLIAMS: It's very nuance .BOLLING: That's right.WILLIAMS: . because as you read in the constitution, it's about a militia. We're not talking about militia; we are talking about individual rights to own a gun.BOLLING: There's a comma after the militia part.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I give up.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: It's still Scalia and by the Supreme Court I've ruled on your side, so fine. That's the rule -- that's the law.BOLLING: But you admit that she answered a different question twice --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: She didn't answer directly. That's what I'm saying --BILA: Yes.SHILLUE: I would think, it was pretty bad that she -- he said, ""Is it a right?"" And she said, ""If it is a right.""WILLIAMS: Right.SHILLUE: When you start your answer that way --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Because she disagrees.GUILFOYLE: And --WILLIAMS: And many people disagree, but I just want to make one last point here.GUILFOYLE: Please.WILLIAMS: Donald Trump is the one who has historically said, ""Let's have a ban on assault weapons. Let's have one on our way."" Not Hillary Clinton.GUILFOYLE: Well, and Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama had suggested that Australia's confiscation of guns, this is to be of national buyback, taking people's gun is a good example. It doesn't tell you exactly what's on the horizon, what's the intention there? I mean, it's very obvious there.BOLLING: She wants it both ways, though. She wants to --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Talk to her base; you pointed it out.BILA: Yeah.BOLLING: She want to talk to her base and say look, I can't --BILA: Yeah.BOLLING: I can't condone gun ownership.WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: She can't do that. But she also wants to -- in order for her to win, she have to win the independent vote, right? She has to. Independents are -- I would say fall, much more in favor of the Second Amendment than against the Second Amendment.WILLIAMS: Well, she, she is --BOLLING: But she can't go head-to-head and do that, and go all out --BILA: Yeah.BOLLING: I'm against guns, because she will lose the independent vote.WILLIAMS: Well, first of all, this is exactly what we said about Obama. He's going to come get your guns. He's going to come get your votes. It's drove up gun purchases and purchase of .GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: . ammunition in the country. So this is something now that Trump and the republican's leadership want to play on to generate more turnouts .BOLLING: So why would they say yes?WILLIAMS: That's why the NRA --BOLLING: Yes.BILA: She could have said --WILLIAMS: Because she doesn't --BOLLING: You know what is the right.WILLIAMS: You know what? I just told you. Supreme Court has ruled in your favor. Doesn't mean that everybody has to agree, in fact, lots of people think this was about a militia. That's what --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: But the problem is she is running for president has the opportunity to try and change --WILLIAMS: Nobody is changing.BOLLING: And in fact, just amend --WILLIAMS: Has Obama changing?GUILFOYLE: The 27 words.WILLIAMS: They think Obama is even more anti-gun than her.GUILFOYLE: Right. But she wants to confiscate and she said like semi- automatic rifles, AR-15, any rifle that's capable .WILLIAMS: But that's exactly, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: . of firing more than five rounds.WILLIAMS: If Obama hasn't done anything, and the same thing was said about Obama.GUILFOYLE: Because he can't get it done.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: Has he tried? Has he tried?GUILFOYLE: Oh. It ain't happening. All right, ahead. Hillary is closing in on the magic number she needs to clinch the nomination. Is tomorrow the end of the road for Bernie Sanders? Will he fight on if he loses California? And should he fight on -- next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BILA: It's Hillary Clinton 24 hours away from clinching the nomination. Six more states vote tomorrow. The secretary picked up more delegates over the weekend with wins in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. According to the AP she's now 26 delegates tie of the numbers she need to become the presumptive democratic nominee. She was asked today, ""Should Sanders concede?""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: We'll wait and find out. Actually, tomorrow is eight years to the day after I withdrew and endorsed then Senator Obama. I believed it was the right thing to do, no matter what differences we had in our long campaign. They pale in comparison with the differences we have with the republicans, and that is actually even more true today.(END VIDEO CLIP)BILA: Well, Sanders, he's not backing down. He's going after Clinton, harder than ever.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BERNIE SANDERS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Do I have a problem when a sitting secretary of state and foundation run by her husband collects many millions of dollars from foreign governments, governments which are dictatorships.TAPPER: Yeah.SANDERS: Then why republicans --TAPPER: Do you think it creates the appearance of conflict of interest?SANDERS: I do. I do.(END VIDEO CLIP)BILA: Juan, I want to go to you first. How do you feel about Sanders staying in at this point? Because he is going after Clinton hard, pretty hard, bringing up, you know, the global initiative, bringing up these donations to places where dictators are where gay rights and women's rights are not a priority. Is he helping out Donald Trump now?WILLIAMS: I think he is. And I think that's why you're saying now, President Obama says, he expects to soon make an endorsement in this. I think he wants it over. I think you are seeing the democratic leadership from Harry Reid, the former Senate majority leader, now Senate minority leader on down the line. I mean, everybody is seems to be saying, hey, Bernie Sanders slow down, you haven't won. Even If you take away the super delegates, Hillary Clinton still has the lead. And after this weekend with the winds in the Virgin Islands in Puerto Rico, as you pointed out, she's less than 30. I think some people will say its 23, some say 26, but she's less than 30 delegates away. So no matter what happens tomorrow in California, you have -- and this is what Bernie is really worried about that after New Jersey, you get Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly, and a like saying, Hillary Clinton just won tonight. She won the democratic nomination. She made American history, first woman. And no matter what happens in California, including the possibility of a Bernie Sanders win, that he will be eclipsed. That it won't be his moment. Bernie is burning.GUILFOYLE: Yup.WILLIAMS: He's still on fire. He wants that political revolution. But you know what he is coming across as a little bit of a cry baby, sore loser at this point, and he's hurting her.GUILFOYLE: True.BILA: Well, I'm curious to where --(CROSSTALK)BILA: Where those voters go?(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: Apostrophe.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Apostrophe. Mean.BILA: Where do they go? Where do the voters go, though? Because I -- when I talk to Bernie Sanders supporters, the bulk of them say, ""I will not vote for her. I cannot stand her."" Do they ultimately decide? You know what, she's a lesser or two evil -- they just stay home.BOLLING: It's a big, there's a big opportunity for Trump to pick a lot of that support. They're just is. He talked to a lot of people who are anti- Hillary, they just, that (inaudible)? Where are they going to go?BILA: Right.BOLLING: They're going to stay home which won't help her or they'll probably, even some of them, portion of it will go, go vote Trump. I was watching Bernie Sanders today. You are right. It's over. It's done. It may get to the point where she has a big night tomorrow night. She won't even need the super delegates. She'll have enough committed delegates to lock down the nomination. It's over. But watching Bernie today, he's a really nice guy. He's a likable guy. He's an honest guy. He said look, we are going to get beat up badly in New Jersey, I know that, and we'll lose California unless there's a huge turnout. But I'm thinking, and I'm watching him thinking, why didn't early on, the Sanders campaign, why didn't he say, ""I'm going to -- I'm going to push back on the democrat socialist stuff. I'm a Democrat. I'm done with the socialism. It didn't work; I need to pivot."" He might have had this thing locked up.BILA: Yes.BOLLING: He's the much more likable of the two. And I'll tell you what...BILA: Wow.BOLLING: ... he lines up much more aggressively...GUILFOYLE: Yes.BOLLING: ... against Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton. I think Trump owns a general election against Hillary and would have had a tough time against Sanders.BILA: You know, Kimberly, he's -- one thing he has served, I think he has exposed a lot of Hillary's weaknesses. And I want to show you an ad. There is a pro-Trump super PAC ad that's also exposing a lot of her weaknesses. And it's tying Hillary's weaknesses in the e-mail scandal to her husband, Bill Clinton's indiscretions. I want to get your take on it. Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I want to say one thing...HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We turned over everything.B. CLINTON: I want you to listen to me.H. CLINTON: I did not...B. CLINTON: I did not...H. CLINTON: I did not send classified material.B. CLINTON: Not a single time.H. CLINTON: And I did not receive...B. CLINTON: Never.H. CLINTON: ... any material that was marked or designated classified.B. CLINTON: I never told anybody to lie.H. CLINTON: That's all I can say.B. CLINTON: These allegations are false.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you (UNINTELLIGIBLE)H. CLINTON: I don't know how it works digitally at all.(END VIDEOTAPE)BILA: Funny. It's funny, but is it effective? What do you think?GUILFOYLE: Funny, isn't it? Memories.Yes, I think it is effective. But that's the type of thing you want to see, the focus on that. Because there's so much material to work with against Hillary Clinton and the Clintons in general and the Clinton kind of corrupt machine. Right? And that's what you need to really hammer on to get people to say, ""You know what? Maybe I've said or done a few things, but look at her. She does have a record that you can look at and you can pick apart to say that she lacks the competency to be able to be commander and she"" -- well, which is what Bernie Sanders has said. Right? He questioned that about her and her ability to do the job and whether or not she would be a good choice. That's why he's still staying in it to run.I also think, just to tag back on the other subject, that Bernie should stay in. Give them some trouble. But the Dems, I know, they want him out. Because guess what? If Hillary Clinton ends up in indictment trouble, et cetera, et cetera, they want Joe Biden.BILA: Right.GUILFOYLE: But if Bernie is in it all the way to the end, it makes it even messier. And they're going to have a very, very nasty convention.BILA: Now, if you were advising Bernie Sanders -- and I don't know why they haven't hired you yet; I mean, you're brilliant.SHILLUE: I'm from New England.BILA: But if you...GUILFOYLE: And the dental floss. Plan ahead.BILA: The dental floss, exactly. His teeth would be beautiful. But if you were advising him, what would you tell him to do in terms of now what he should be doing with respect to Hillary? Should he go hard on -- should he bring up the e-mails? Is this his moment in time to get tough?SHILLUE: Well, if they hired me as an adviser before, I would have told him to go tough on her before. He -- he was treating her with kid gloves until lately.BILA: Right.SHILLUE: So the time to be tough on Hillary has passed. But of course, I think he should stay in. Oh, poor Hillary; she has someone running against her. I mean, that's politics.This entitlement thing, you can really see it with Hillary. She was annoyed to run against Barack Obama. She was saying, ""What's going on here? I have to deal with this?"" And then she's been treating Bernie the same way. Well, guess what? People like Bernie more than they like you. And I don't think he's likable at all, Eric.BILA: Well, not more than they like me.SHILLUE: Well, look...BILA: I mean, let's not get carried away.SHILLUE: Eric thinks he's -- no, Eric thinks he's likable. I don't think he is. He's just more likable than Hillary.BILA: I actually think he's very likable. I met him.WILLIAMS: You know, I would agree with you that I don't. But let me just say to Eric that a recent poll of Sanders supporters found only 6 percent - - 6 percent -- had a positive view of Donald Trump. So this fantasy you have about...GUILFOYLE: Here we go again.WILLIAMS: ... oh, all these Sanders people are going to run over...GUILFOYLE: ""Fantasy Island.""WILLIAMS: Well, it is. Because I think that's the basis of your argument.GUILFOYLE: Eric and Mr. Roarke.WILLIAMS: Working-class people in states like West Virginia, Ohio, Michigan might, in fact, flip those states to red states.BOLLING: Well, look what's going down on the right. I mean, the ""never Trump"" crowd, they are voting for Hillary. They are. Some of them are actually voting for Hillary; some of them are staying home, which is in essence a vote for Hillary.BILA: Yes.BOLLING: You get the same thing on the other side, and it plays right in.WILLIAMS: I'm just saying the numbers.GUILFOYLE: We'll see what happened. People did that then with Romney. They stayed home, they didn't come out, and what happened? Oh, hi. You again, Barack Obama. Fantastic.BILA: Well, if I were advising Bernie, I don't have the dental floss, but I would tell him to stay in. But you know?SHILLUE: I'm always here for you.BILA: Well, you have better teeth.Coming up on ""The Five,"" we pay tribute to the greatest, Muhammad Ali, gone too soon at the age of 74. We'll be back in a moment.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MUHAMMAD ALI, FORMER HEAVYWEIGHT BOXING CHAMPION: He wanted to go to heaven, so I took him in seven.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You took him in seven?ALI: I'm the king of the world!UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hold it, hold it, hold it. Hold it, you re not desperate.ALI: I'm a bad man.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wait, wait.ALI: I shook up the world! I shook up the world! I shook up the world!(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: It was a moment that reduced many to tears, including me. Muhammad Ali emerging from the darkness 20 years ago in Atlanta to light the Olympic flame. The world is certainly a little darker now that the Greatest is gone.Ali was a hero to millions. He was my hero. I've been fortunate to have had the honor to meet him several times. I interviewed the boxing legend back in 2001. Here is a picture of us goofing around, me pretending to punch him. We've had dinner, and I've been with him at a couple of charity events.To see Ali in the ring, though, that was astounding. He moved with a ballet dancer's grace, and he was a big guy: 6'2"", over 200 pounds. But when he retired, he became even bigger than the sport.President Obama said it well: Muhammad Ali shook up the world, and we are all better for it.Funeral services will be held in Kentucky on Thursday and Friday. His family has invited me to attend. His legacy, that will live on forever.You know, I was thinking that -- to myself -- I wrote this on FOXNews.com. He's the most famous man of the 20th Century. He's a boxer, an American, Muhammad Ali. Anybody here agree or disagree?BOLLING: Most famous man of the 20th Century?WILLIAMS: Yes, Muhammad Ali. I think you can go -- I think about him in China, everybody.BOLLING: I think McMellon (ph) might give a run for the money. But can I just say that he -- you're right. He was the -- he was the sport. He made the sport amazing. But the best part of Muhammad Ali wasn't when he was in the ring. It was afterwards.Do you remember all those -- all those times he would leave, and he would go to a classroom of kids? These kids would just light up, and he was so much fun. He could talk to little kids. He could talk to politicians. He owned the media.He -- whatever he's doing right now, everyone should take some of that and use it. Because wow. He just -- he just -- when he was getting such pushback for becoming a Muslim -- remember all that issue? And he just turned it around and made him...GUILFOYLE: And the draft.BOLLING: ... lovable. Yes, and they pushed back on. So there's a lot of things that people were bothered.WILLIAMS: People didn't like that at all.BOLLING: But he turned it around.SHILLUE: My memory as a kid was that he had a lot of support. I grew up in a very Catholic town. And a lot of people respected his -- you know, his freedom of religion. And he talked about that. I remember my parents supported him at the time, and they explained to me that he -- that he was a conscientious objector.And, you know, I used to watch him on the entertainment shows, and he would go on with Howard Cosell.WILLIAMS: Yes.SHILLUE: And he was rhyming and he was -- you know, as a kid, that's what I knew him from, was the entertainment shows. And he was kind of freestyle. This was the era before hip-hop. But he would go on and freestyle...GUILFOYLE: Original rapper.SHILLUE: Yes. And he -- and he would improvise, but he was never profane. He was always very clean. And he was very -- I mean, I just loved him as a kid. And you know, I think he was so dignified. And so the way he -- it was so hard to be -- it was so hard to be a black athlete at the time, to be a black celebrity, but he handled it so well.WILLIAMS: And on that point, it was so unusual to see an athlete, specifically a black athlete, willing to speak out on social/political issues. Because everybody else, I mean, up to Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods, they keep quiet, because that's going to affect their bottom line.But Jedediah, he spoke out early on.BILA: Yes, I love that. The word that I think of when I think of him is ""fearless."" Because in so many ways, in his work, outside of his work, he just spoke his mind, whether it was controversial or not.And a lot of times, when we hear celebrities, you know, actors or athletes, speak about politics, we cringe. But when he would do it, he would make you think about those issues. And even if you weren't inclined to agree with him, you left those moments having so much respect for him as a human being who had really thought through these things and was making an impact on his daily life in so many ways, not only in his work.So you know, he left the world too soon. I think no matter who you are, you do kind of know his name and you know what he stood for. And you know that his mark is left in a really big way.WILLIAMS: It certainly is. So Kimberly, you know, I was saying before that when I saw him like that torch in Atlanta, it really shook me up, because it was unclear who was going to have that honor for the United States of America. And there, suddenly, comes the kid who was the outsider. You now, people didn't like him. You know, I have friends who still don't like him, because he evaded the draft. He told me he didn't evade the draft; he just avoided it. But he didn't serve. Joe Louis served. Right?GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: And there are people, though, who would say, ""Ali, you changed your name. You went from being a Christian to a Muslim."" People didn't -- some people didn't like that.GUILFOYLE: Right. But I mean, that's his prerogative. It's his choice, you know, to embrace religious freedom, which we celebrate in this country, and we help others in need across the world when they are fighting for their religious freedom, like we see the Christians being persecuted, you know, by ISIS.So it's important to stand up for your personal beliefs, your religious beliefs. And that's why this is the greatest country in the world, much like Muhammad Ali was the, you know, greatest boxer.I love the sport of boxing. I love to box myself. And I just have found him to be personally inspirational, you know, in my life and just someone that has that kind of level of confidence and fighting for what you believe in, I think is a good lesson for young people, too.BOLLING: Can you help me out here?WILLIAMS: What?BOLLING: There was a documentary on the -- the rumble in the jungle. I can't remember the name of the documentary. Remember the name? It is phenomenal. If you have -- what's that?SHILLUE: Amazing.BOLLING: ""When We Were Kings,"" yes.WILLIAMS: ""When We Were Kings.""BOLLING: Amazing. If you have any inkling to watch this at all, it will be the best one or two hours, however long that thing is.GUILFOYLE: Great.WILLIAMS: And one last note. Let me just say, his fight against Parkinson's, for everybody, anybody in your family...GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: ... extraordinary.GUILFOYLE: Courageous.WILLIAMS: Last event he attended in Arizona for the Parkinson's, anti -- the people who are fighting Parkinson's is what I'm trying to say.Tune in to the FOX News Channel on Thursday and Friday for coverage of memorial services for Muhammad Ali. The world will never forget him.Ahead, a surprising medical reason why some of us -- hmm, I wonder if I'm in this? -- are chronically late. Stick around.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SHILLUE: We've all been late to something, but some people are late to everything. You know who you are.GUILFOYLE: Juan.SHILLUE: You drive your friends and family mad when you're not on time, and you may be the mad one, actually. One scientist is diagnosing chronic lateness as an illness, a sign of insanity, a bizarre compulsion to defeat oneself by making plans you know you can't keep.Juan, why is everyone looking at you? I don't understand.GUILFOYLE: Because Juan confessed.WILLIAMS: First I thought you were looking at Jedediah.SHILLUE: I did. Just go.WILLIAMS: But in fact, if this was my family around this table, they'd say, ""Let me introduce you to the late Juan Williams."" I mean, it's bad. It's horrible.BOLLING: Not that late. Kind of late.WILLIAMS: I'm late.BOLLING: So Kimberly, do you remember Benghazi, one of the worst nights in the history of ""The Five""?GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God. Are you talking about that?BOLLING: You know why that happened? Because Juan was late. You remember that?WILLIAMS: Me.GUILFOYLE: Is that what it was?BOLLING: We were trying to get a group together in Iowa to go to a dinner.GUILFOYLE: That actually was, yes.BOLLING: And we're waiting for Juan. So half the group goes to dinner, and the other half didn't. It became a whole thing.GUILFOYLE: Became a big thing.BOLLING: So we can blame Benghazi on...WILLIAMS: I never heard this story, but it's possible.GUILFOYLE: Yes, with our executive producer. I ate alone with him the next night.SHILLUE: Do you believe in the insanity defense, Eric, that it...?BOLLING: I'm always on time. I don't know. Always on time.SHILLUE: So, it must be -- Kimberly, it must be rudeness, then, right? I think that it is.GUILFOYLE: No, but...SHILLUE: Somebody once told me it was self-absorption. And I bought that.GUILFOYLE: Well, I don't know. It depends on how busy you are and if you live in New York. But besides that, your family said -- your sister was upset with you, right?SHILLUE: Yes. I remember one time -- I used to be late to everything. And I went to meet my sister, and she said, ""You know, that's selfish, showing up late.""And I said, ""It is? I thought I was just scatter-brained. Isn't that kind of a cute thing?""GUILFOYLE: You're like nice...SHILLUE: She said, ""No, it's not. It's self-absorption."" And I stopped.WILLIAMS: But here's the thing, Tom. It says now it may be a medical condition. In fact, it has this thing here, CLIP: chronically late, insane people.SHILLUE: I know.GUILFOYLE: Juan, this explains everything.WILLIAMS: Oh, no. But it also says, Kimberly...GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: ... that people who are late tend to be more optimistic. They think they can get more things done in a limited amount of time.SHILLUE: That makes sense, yes.BILA: It's called delusional.SHILLUE: Well, look, Jedediah...BILA: Yes.SHILLUE: ... women are allowed to show up late. Like on a date, if a woman shows up late, I'm going to give her a little time. Right? I'm back in my -- my single days.But guys cannot get away with the same thing, can they? What if a guy who showed up late on a date with you?BILA: They'd be out. I don't like people who are late. I also don't like people who are early, though. Basically, I don't like people.But no, because like my dad has that affliction, where he'll tell me he's going to be there at 12, but at 11:15, he's outside in the car and then I've got to rush and do everything, you know.So I think -- I think you were right, though. Whoever told you that it was self-absorption -- and I think that might have been me.SHILLUE: Yes.BILA: They're 100 percent right. Because you can't -- you can't, like -- it's like it's all about you. It's all about your day, and your schedule. You don't take a minute to realize somebody else has a day, and a night, and a life.SHILLUE: That's what...GUILFOYLE: Sounds like a guy really made you mad.BILA: Yes, listen, I have a few complaints. I'll be writing a book about that later.SHILLUE: Busy people...GUILFOYLE: I wouldn't be mad if a guy showed up late. I mean, if it's like they always do, they come an hour late, I mean, come on. They're going to, like, get there. Sometimes people get there when they get there.SHILLUE: Well, you know...BILA: Do they have to arrive with a special gift if they're late? Because I think that would be important.GUILFOYLE: Really?SHILLUE: Oh, yes.BILA: Listen...GUILFOYLE: No, I think you should be understanding.SHILLUE: If I am late, I do. I get a gift.GUILFOYLE: Really? I'm understanding.SHILLUE: I get a gift, because I know it is -- it's bad to show up late. And you should repent if you are late.WILLIAMS: You know that the funniest thing I read about this?GUILFOYLE: Let them know you're on your way.WILLIAMS: That Vladimir Putin showed up late to negotiate with Angela Merkel, and she left. She just walked out.SHILLUE: You've got to show them. All right.GUILFOYLE: That's a boss move.SHILLUE: ""One More Thing"" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: All righty. Time for ""One More Thing."" I'm going to start with a big announcement about this year's FOX Fan Weekend. It kicks off on Friday, June 24 with a ""FOX and Friends"" summer concert.

I'll start with my ""One More Thing,"" very quickly. This is prom weekend for Eric Chase. Check it out. Here's the first picture. Eric and the lovely Gabrielle right there on the way to prom. That's a pre-prom picture.Next picture, very quickly, all the boys in the line. Eric is second to the right there. The fellows before their big night out. And finally, a little -- I don't know -- it's just an action shot in the middle of all that going on. They had a great time. Congratulations on everyone going to prom.OK, K.G., you're up.GUILFOYLE: I have the best ""One More Thing"" ever, because our very own Greta Van Susteren, yes, dominating, once again. Sixth year in a row, Greta has made the Forbes list of Women's 100 Most Powerful. All right? I love this. I want a recount. She can in at 94, should have been No. 1. That went to Angela Merkel followed up by Hillary Clinton.And did you know this? That actually, Greta has been a fixture on this list every year since 2011. I think that's very cool. We're very proud of her. She's my great friend. And this list represents, quote, ""the smartest and toughest female business leaders, entrepreneurs, investors, scientists, philanthropists and CEOs, making their mark in the world today."" Well done.BOLLING: Excellent. Congratulations, Greta, from all of us.All right, Juanito. You're up.WILLIAMS: All right. So an Army strong ""hoo-rah"" to Deshauna Barber. This weekend, she became the first member of the military to win Miss USA. She's a D.C. native. So I really take some pride in that.But what really strikes me is that this 26-year-old lieutenant in the Army Reserve plans to use her title for veterans' causes to help fight the issue of suicide and post-traumatic disorder that so many members of the military are facing. So good for her. And once again, Army ""hoo-rah.""Did I get that right, guys? Hoo-rah.BOLLING: You know, did you hear -- did you watch that? Did you see her final -- the answer to her final question?WILLIAMS: No.BOLLING: She was amazing. She nailed it.WILLIAMS: All right.BOLLING: I mean, she just crushed it. Congratulations.Jedediah, you're up.BILA: Well, this won't surprise you all, but sometimes Tom Shillue's friends around the world, they cause trouble.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.BILA: And this particular monkey in India, potentially trained by Tom, he waited outside of a jewelry store. He got the owner to throw him some crumbs. Then he busts the door open. He runs inside. He steals money from the register and leaves. So that's what happens when you leave your pets and/or friends with Tom Shillue.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.SHILLUE: I think it's great. They're always stealing food. They should steal cash. It's much more practical.BILA: Did you train that monkey?SHILLUE: Not a perishable item.GUILFOYLE: Like ""Ocean's 11"" or ""13,"" ""14,"" on of those.BOLLING: You realize that happens?GUILFOYLE: Yes, they train them to steal.BOLLING: They train monkeys for pickpockets.BILA: That's what I'm talking about.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.BOLLING: It's your fault.SHILLUE: No, I like the old-fashioned grinder. I like the musical monkey. That's my -- that's my gig.BOLLING: You're up.GUILFOYLE: OK. You can take that.SHILLUE: All right. The other night on ""Red Eye,"" we did a story about crickets. Apparently, they're a food source that has wonderful protein, and they're the wave of the future. People are going to be eating crickets in the future. So we got a bowl of them. Roll the tape. I was eating crickets on the air. And no one...GUILFOYLE: So gross.SHILLUE: JoAnn was a little grossed out. Jedediah, I think -- you were on the panel. None of my panelists would eat crickets except me.BILA: I would have done it.GUILFOYLE: Were they alive?BOLLING: You mean real?SHILLUE: Yes. Crickets. We had a bowl of crickets.BILA: Were they chocolate covered? Or...SHILLUE: No, they were not -- they had a little smokiness to them. They were cooked.BILA: What did they taste like?GUILFOYLE: So they're dead crickets.SHILLUE: They tasted like crickets. I mean, they were -- they were...BILA: I thought you were going to say taste like chicken.SHILLUE: They don't taste like chicken.GUILFOYLE: That will never make it to ""Kimberly's Food Court."" All right. Cancelled, crickets.WILLIAMS: So I was in China. In fact, I was in China for the Olympics, and that's the only time I've eaten scorpion.SHILLUE: I ate scorpion in China.WILLIAMS: There you go.BILA: You'll eat anything.SHILLUE: Yes. I ate something else in China. I can't even say it.GUILFOYLE: Are you missing some thrills in your life?BILA: Oh, man.SHILLUE: It was part of a mutton that I ate.WILLIAMS: Oh, well, good. That's better.SHILLUE: The part you wouldn't want to eat.GUILFOYLE: Great.BOLLING: Let's leave it right there.SHILLUE: Exactly.GUILFOYLE: Family show.BOLLING: Never miss an episode of ""The Five.""

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, just 18 hours after Donald Trump wins the White House and less than 12 hours after our leaders call for unity, groups of protesters take to streets in a half dozen cities to vent their anger and frustration at the election of Donald Trump.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly. At this hour we are seeing anti-Trump protest breaking out in a handful of major cities, including New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and in Oakland, California.  These protests come near hours after the President, the President-elect, and the woman who wanted to be president, all call for the exact opposite of what we're seeing. Imploring the country to come together, following a historical political victory. We will have more on that part of the story in just a moment.But first we go to Rob Schmitt who is on the streets in New York City with the protesters. Rob, what are you seeing?ROB SCHMITT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Megyn, we are only about eight blocks away from you. But this is a massive protest. This all started at 6:00 tonight in Union Square. Thousands and thousands of people marched up through the rain. There you go. This is a perfect example of it. We gotcha, buddy. About thousands. Several thousand in the rain came up here. Very motivated to get up here. Now, we're outside Trump Tower. We are at 54th and 5th Avenue, not too far away from our headquarters.And this is just been an explosion of anger at the election of Donald Trump. Something that you have probably been seeing on social media all day long. Something you've been seeing with people all around you.  Especially in major cities. New York is no stranger to the protest. We have always known that. We can show you a couple shots from a helicopter from above. We show you the scope of these protests. This is thousands of people here on 5th Avenue. A very impressive showing of support for the other side. The side that didn't win in this election, frankly.A lot of anger here. And when you really look at the people here, you can see exactly what they are talking about. And a lot of curse words as you heard right there. But when you look at what this is comprised of, the people that are here, that angry right now, if you remember that in the comments that were leaked from Hillary Clinton when she talked about the Bernie supporters saying that the disillusioned people, that she said were living in their parents' basement, they're upset.This is a lot of that fabric. This is a lot of Bernie Sanders supporters.  This is a lot of Black Lives Matter. This is a lot of, I mean, there is a hodgepodge of so many different groups here that are angry that want some answers about what has happened, about how this election occurred, about how Donald Trump is now the president of the United States and they seem absolutely confused by it. Even the Nurses Union had a showing here. So, you're seeing a number of groups all coming together. They're all shouting different things. There is, you know, a lot of screaming fascism and other things like that.So, it is a major show of support like I said for the side that didn't win in this election and Donald Trump is enemy number one. I'm not sure if he is home at Trump Tower. But if he is, he has thousands of people right outside his doorstep that really don't like him. Megyn, we'll send it back to you.KELLY: Rob, can you get in there and ask questions of some of these folks?  I would like to know, whether A, they voted, and B, what they think of President Obama's call for unity, Hillary Clinton's call for unity, not to mention Donald Trump.SCHMITT: Yes. We certainly can I can bring some at the end. We are at risk after curse word or two. But --KELLY: Well we're heard that before.SCHMITT: Anybody? Anybody? Everybody shy?KELLY: Get in there, Rob, come on!SCHMITT: I really am. Anybody? Can I just ask you if you voted?   UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.SCHMITT: Who did you vote for?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not your guy.KELLY: Not your guy.SCHMITT: Not our guy. Megyn, apparently we have a guy. I didn't know we had guy.(LAUGHTER)SCHMITT: But he didn't vote for our guy.KELLY: Welcome to New York City.SCHMITT: Everyone here is very camera shy. So, we'll send it back to you.KELLY: It's amazing. Rob, thank you.You what is amazing is, these people come out to, you know, Times Square and Fifth Avenue and they want to make their voices heard. Except on Fox News. Which has the biggest viewership in all of cable. And then they claim up. They don't want to be heard at all. That's helpful to your position. Ironically this whole scene is playing out after we saw a remarkable call for unity today. From President Obama, from President-elect Trump and from Hillary Clinton. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Last night I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country. I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans.DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENT-ELECT: Hillary worked a very long and very hard over a long period of time. And we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I mean that very sincerely.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I want to make sure that hand off is well-executed because ultimately, we are all on same team.CLINTON: Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.TRUMP: It is time for America to bind the open wounds of division. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all- Americans. And this is so important to me.OBAMA: We all want what's best for this country. That's what I heard in Mr. Trump's remarks last night. That's what I heard when I spoke to him.  Directly. And I was heartened by that.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: In moments, we will be joined by former Clinton spokesman Mo Elleithee but we begin tonight with Bill Bennett who served as secretary of education under President Reagan and is the chairman of conservative leaders for education.Bill, good to see you. So, now as we watched these protest in the streets of seven major cities tonight, and it doesn't seem like the Democrats, I'm assuming they're Democrats, are really listening to their sitting president's call for unity, to Hillary Clinton's call for unity, and you tell me how they get past that and accept the result that the American people have reached fair and square.BILL BENNETT, FORMER EDUCATION SECRETARY: Well, there's no really no time-outs, you know, no stopping the action at a busy country. If people thought we would have a 24-hour or 48-hour break, we don't. You know, they are exercising their free speech rights. But what exactly are they protesting? Constitutional republic's way of engaging in democracy?KELLY: I mean, the chant seem to amount to ""F Donald Trump."" So, when asked to explain further the one gentleman we spoke with declined based on the fact that it was Fox News Channel. Go ahead, Bill.BENNETT: Yes, Fox News guy. Yes. So, it's a tantrum. It's our guy lost or our gal lost so we will going to protest. But you know, the way democracy works, one side loses, one side wins. Now, you know, it is a bit of a charade to talk about, let's have peace and unity. It's appreciated.  I appreciate what Hillary Clinton said, what the President said and what the president-elect said. But we know as soon as you get into issues, as soon as you get into serious discussion if Donald Trump follows his agenda and let's say starts with getting rid of ObamaCare, there will be serious disagreement. And that's part of democracy too.KELLY: And should he do that? You know, some are already saying, oh, he is going to moderate. You know, who knows if he's going live up to these campaign promises. What do you think?BENNETT: Yes. Well, sure he should. I mean, that's a promise. That's what people took him for his word and took him seriously and supported him.  Yes. That's what he ran on. Look, part of this is, will he reach out?  Will he reach out to the other side? Which means will he compromise his views which in the end means, will he give up his views? But Donald Trump is not one too easily to hedge on these things. So of course he will. And of course there will be opposition to it. Can it be civil? Sure. Should it be civil? Yes. Will it be? Who knows. But he was elected to do certain things and he should by all means proceed do that. And what an extraordinary opportunity, Megyn with the House and the Senate. Can I just say one other thing?KELLY: Yes.BENNETT: I've been watching Fox all day, as loyal as I am to you guys.  And everybody is apologizing for being wrong. All of the pollsters and everybody. I'm not apologizing. I wasn't wrong. And I'm not going to toot my horn but there were some of us who weren't all wrong. I heard that a lot today. Some of us actually thought Trump would win and we thought he had good reason to win.KELLY: Uh-hm. And on top of that, Bill, I mean, you're of the mind that it's good to reach out. It's good to shoot for unity but that the other -- it is -- the Trump detractors who need to go to him to try to reach that unity. Explain that. Because you know, many people have said that he as the man in power needs to sort of roll out the carpet and say, you are welcome and you will be well received.BENNETT: There's a difference between engaging with goodwill on issues with which you disagree and engaging to such a degree that you neuter yourself and you neuter your own views. He should do the former but not the latter. He can step forward and say, I was open about the issues. I think we should get rid of all of these executive orders and I plan to do that with an executive order the first day and he can do that in a civil way. That doesn't mean it will be greeted with hallelujahs.But you know, there's a difference again between operating with goodwill and in disagreement and acting in a disagreeable way. I think he will not be disagreeable if he can help it. But it is going to be hard for him not to help it because he is going to get attacked big time. I watched CNN for five minutes today. Only five minutes, Megyn, I promise. Then they said, well, Donald Trump promised unity today and to reach out. But he wasn't always so unified during the campaign. Well, you know, and then they played all these quotes.KELLY: Yes. It is like Trump says, this is a nasty business, politics.  Which he is new to but played very well. Bill, I got go. Great to see you.BENNETT: Big boisterous country. We will going to survive it. Thank you.  Nice job by the way. Get any sleep yet?KELLY: Thank you. Not yet. But it's looking good for tonight.BENNETT: All right. Try MyPillow.com.(LAUGHTER)KELLY: I've got like eight of them. Thanks to the MyPillow people.All right. Also with us tonight, Mo Elleithee, he served as traveling press secretary in Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, he is the founding executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service. Mo, good to see you.MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY'S INSTITUTE OF POLITICS AND PUBLIC SERVICE: Hi, Megyn.KELLY: So, when you see folks taking to the street tonight, I mean, especially in light of what we heard today which is in essence that she lost because the Democrats didn't show up. Trump got his vote out. And she didn't. Her ground game. You know, you have talked about a lot. They did not show up for her. And yet, now they are out there.ELLEITHEE: Yes, look, I am, you know, I'm the first to admit, listening to what Bill just said, I'm the first to admit, I always thought Donald Trump could win. I did not think he would win. I am one of those people who is sort of eating crow today. And I totally agree with Hillary Clinton and President Obama. That it is time for us to come together and we do need to get the president-elect the benefit of the doubt. And that we should root for him. We should want our president to be successful. And as part of the loyal opposition that doesn't mean we don't hold him accountable. And try to nudge him our way. But we want success. Having said that, that's our end of the bargain.He's got to do his part as well. Remember, he lost the popular vote. A majority of the people who cast votes did not vote for him. That doesn't mean he is illegitimate. He is absolutely legitimate be the president-elect. He won fair and square. But it shows just how divided this nation is. And one of the reasons why it is so divided, one of the reasons, is his rhetoric. During the campaign. And the things he said that really upset, caused pain and caused fear in millions and millions of Americans.  That's on him now. To reach out to those people.KELLY: How? How does he get past that? I mean, how, there are many groups who are scared today. They're scared today.ELLEITHEE: Yes.KELLY: But how does a President-elect Trump get them past that?ELLEITHEE: Yes. I think in part with words and in part with actions. And he needs to move swiftly and somewhat delicately but needs to go out there and speak to these groups. And demonstrate through both words and actions that what he said last night and what I thought was a really good and strong speech. Much more gracious than a lot of us gave him credit for being. Or for being able to be. He needs to prove the point he made in that speech that he does want to be a president for all-Americans.Through his words and through his actions. So I think both sides of the equation here have some work to do, we are completely polarized and divided. There are some issues I am hopeful for that the President and both parties in Congress can work on, infrastructural form, which used to be a bipartisan issue.KELLY: He mentioned that last night.ELLEITHEE: He mentioned that last night. That would be a great first issue to start on them. All sides can come together on. But that fear that we're seeing in the streets tonight, you know, I wish we weren't seeing that tonight but he has to recognize his part in that equation and move out.KELLY: But before I let you go, Mo.ELLEITHEE: Yes.KELLY: As somebody tied in the Democratic circles, what feedback are you getting? I mean, what's the level of emotion and what are the emotions?ELLEITHEE: Yes. I don't think I have ever seen the kind of emotion that I'm seeing after this election. There is a lot of sadness and there is a lot of fear. There are a lot of people in the democratic family who are truly worried about the future right now. Because of some of the divisiveness that came out of this campaign. And you know, the number of tears that I witnessed today, it is just not unlike anything I've ever seen. We usually get through these elections. I've been through some tough elections. I've seen some pretty divided electorates but this feels a little bit more pronounced than I'm used to seeing. And so, like I said, we all have our work cut out for us to come together.KELLY: One thing you can say about Donald Trump is he engenders very strong feelings in just about everyone. Right?ELLEITHEE: That is true.KELLY: And he watched his supporters. And now to see his detractors take to the streets of several major cities across America by the thousands.  Protesting, the will of the people, essentially. And you point out she won the popular vote but of course that's not the way it works in our republic.ELLEITHEE: That's right. That's right.KELLY: That does not win you the presidency which these people understand.ELLEITHEE: That's right.KELLY: And it is quintessentially American to protest as long as they keep it nonviolent and respectful.ELLEITHEE: That's right.KELLY: And so far they have.ELLEITHEE: And civil.KELLY: Mo, good to see you.ELLEITHEE: Thanks. You too.KELLY: We will try to get in touch with some of these people. You can see there's our correspondent Rob Schmitt in the crowd now. And hear what it is -- what is the goal? I mean, they just want to express their anger or their feelings or they want a different result. What is the goal? We will try to figure that out as we watch these marches on the streets of New York, Chicago, Philly and elsewhere tonight.We also saw college student burning flags on a couple of campuses earlier today. Professor Jonathan Turley joins with us tonight with some words of wisdom for these kids. Many of whom could not attend class today because they were so upset.Also tonight, Governor Mike Huckabee and Dana Perino with the scoop on the first hundred days for America's new president. What must Trump do? That is next?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, we are continuing to watch protest marches in a half dozen U.S. cities tonight. Folks angry about the election results.  We are getting somebody mic up. And she is going to speak to us, a couple of people in a minute.Back in Washington, President-elect Donald Trump and the Republicans moving forward with their plans for the country. House Speaker Paul Ryan saying his party is emboldened by Mr. Trump's historic victory. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: I think what Donald Trump just pulled off is an enormous political feat. It's an enormous feat and that he heard those voices that were out there that other people weren't hearing and he just earned a mandate. And we now just have the unified Republican government.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: In moments, Governor Mike Huckabee, Dana Perino both here on what to expect from a Trump administration.But we begin with chief national correspondent Ed Henry. Ed?ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, amazing how winning can bring people together. Paul Ryan calling it a mandate there, after offering no formal endorsement of the Trump campaign. Now the President-Elect is moving quickly to try and convert others perhaps in the case of Nancy Pelosi, it might just be trying to minimize criticism. Trump calling the Democratic leader today and focusing on something they largely agree on that infrastructure Bill to create jobs that you just mentioned.  He also went back to working on Mexican President Pena Nieto to begin trying to follow through on another key campaign promise of building that wall.The Mexican government though still insisting it will not pay for it.  Though the two leaders say they had a cordial talk and agreed to their second meeting soon. And despite a lot of initial Republican skepticism of Trump, the GOP now has a trifecta. The White House and both Chambers of Congress making following through on another key Trump promise about healthcare likely. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY.: It's a pretty high item on our agenda as you know. And I would be shocked if we didn't move forward to keep our commitment to the American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)HENRY: Senator McConnell talking about repealing ObamaCare. A lot harder for Trump though to come up with an alternative to actually fix the problems caused by ObamaCare and problems that are happening before ObamaCare. And if he follows through on undoing the Iran nuclear deal, that could be even more complex with big national security implications which is why Democrats like Tom Daschle, the former Senate leader, told me Trump needs to pull back on some of these more unilateral tendencies that we saw during the campaign if he's going to effectively govern. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TOM DASCHLE, D-FORMER SOUTH DAKOTA SENATOR: Two words that come immediately to mind are outreach and inclusion. There's got to be a lot of outreach and it has got to come both ways.(END VIDEO CLIP)HENRY: Even though he is a Democrat, Tom Daschle told me he thinks that after such a nasty campaign, expectations are now so low that he actually thinks Trump has an opportunity here to get some things done and that just with a little bit of effort he can get a lot of credit -- Megyn.KELLY: Ed, good to see you. Joining me now, Governor Mike Huckabee, former Republican presidential candidate and Dana Perino who is a former Bush White House press secretary and co-host of ""THE FIVE."" Great to see you both.DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CO-HOST, ""THE FIVE"": Thank you.KELLY: So, Dana, let me start with you, as somebody actually helped do this. First 100 days, what does Trump needs to worry about? President- Elect Trump.PERINO: Well, even before those 100 days, what he needs to worry about right now and what I assume they have been thinking about since July, since they started the transition team that Chris Christie is running, is that you have to fill a lot of positions in the government.KELLY: Before inauguration?PERINO: Yes. There are certain national security positions in particular that should never be vacant. And it takes about eight weeks, believe it or not, to do a background check, a thorough background check on somebody in order to give them top secret clearance. So, if you work backwards, you know, 70 days goes by very quickly.KELLY: Immediately.PERINO: And you need to -- there is going to be some great people out there that want it serve. But they're going to have to be vetted, that is a really important thing. Another thing to keep in mind is that there's the cabinet positions. One of the things Harry Reid did is that he paved the way for a cabinet secretaries. Now just need majority. So now the Republicans because they did so well in the Senate races yesterday, have 51 --KELLY: Uh-hm.PERINO: -- they will be able to --KELLY: As opposed to 60.PERINO: Right. Right.KELLY: Yes.PERINO: So, they can be able to put forward those. And then I think that one of the first things that Donald Trump should do, or will do, is he will announce Supreme Court nominee quickly. I think that's something they probably have been prepared to do and that's now just the final decision.KELLY: He submitted his list already of those in --PERINO: And he has to meet those --KELLY: Governor Huckabee, first of all, congratulations to you as a Donald Trump supporter and somebody who like Bill Bennett did predict the Trump victory on this show despite with the polls we're showing. You must feel very gratified. And what would you like to see Donald Trump do as our president-elect in these next 70 days as he gears up to take office?MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, he needs to put together the best possible team he can. Because he's got to hit the ground running. He basically has two years to do a lot of big and bold things. That's because he will have the House, the Senate, and the White House. Maybe he has it after those two years. But we don't know.  But for two years he owns the town. And he's got to make good use of that.  I think he has to remind the Democrats, the words of Barack Obama when Barack Obama said, look, elections have consequences. We won.KELLY: Yes.HUCKABEE: And he proceeded to do what he wanted to do. And that's how we ended up with ObamaCare. I would like to see Donald Trump include Democrats and make as many things bipartisan. But you know what? Our country is in too big a mess to sit around and play patty cake. We have got to get some things fixed.KELLY: And when Barack Obama was trying to push through ObamaCare and the Republicans wanted certain ideas considered, you know, Barack Obama was very much like, I won and you know turn about --HUCKABEE: He basically told them -- well, I mean, he pretty much told him, you put it where the sun don't shine. And that's not a great way to -- influence people but by golly it got the job done. I would love to see Donald Trump at least attempt to bring them in. But if they are unwilling, go ahead and pass the business tax cut to 15 percent. Revoke the Iranian deal. Get rid of ObamaCare. Start putting something in place.There are plenty of things to be done that would actually work. The Republicans were offering those ideas eight years ago. So, I think he has got to move quickly. I do think the infrastructure is something that has bipartisan support but he's got to be clear that he's not going to let that just sit there and sort of drip into win while they nitpick it.KELLY: Dana, last thoughts on what you think a President Trump cabinet will look like and whether you think it's going to be a cast of familiar characters that we have seen on the campaign trail as surrogates.PERINO: Yes. Certainly, I think that some of those people that have been supporting him, he will want to have, take with him to the White House.KELLY: Maybe Governor Huckabee.PERINO: Perhaps so. That would be a good choice.KELLY: Oh, you have the support of James. Congratulations.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: I also think that there are, this will be a tricky thing. There's lots of legislators that could be good that have governing experience or you might look to the governors to pull them in but then how do you make sure that they stay Republican for you to support you and the things that you want to do.KELLY: So, you're saying pull Democrats in?PERINO: No.KELLY: What do you mean stay Republican?PERINO: Meaning that, could they win like -- so if you poll a governor --KELLY: Oh, I see.PERINO: Can that governor be replace by a Republican governor when there is a run off.KELLY: Uh-hm. There is a lot for him to consider.PERINO: So much.KELLY: He's going to need somebody who understands Washington and walk him through. There are rumors that perhaps he might choose Reince Priebus as his chief of staff to run, you know, this process and we shall see.PERINO: A trusted guy.KELLY: They have been saying nice things about each other lately.PERINO: Yes.KELLY: Dana, great to see you.PERINO: You too.KELLY: Governor, you too.So, remember all of the polls that said Hillary Clinton would win? The Fox News Decision Desk, not the desk itself, but Arnon Mishkin is here to explain what happened.Plus, with the growing number of writers suggesting President Obama may have been a big issue in this presidential race. Constitutional Attorney Jonathan Turley is here with a warning for the road ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight. I want to get back on the streets New York where we see thousands of protesters gathered around Trump tower, after some noisy marches thru Midtown Manhattan and among many other cities this evening in response to the election of Donald Trump. Fox News reporter Rob Schmidt is out there with the crowd. Rob?SCHMITT: Megyn, we see the slow dispersal of this crowd, still thousands strong within the inside of it, which is right here behind me. And about maybe a couple thousand have left at this point and still thousands inside of there. The resiliency, you have to admire of these protesters. It is cold out here in New York City tonight. We saw a lot of rain. They walked two miles through midtown Manhattan, putting midtown at a complete gridlock at 7:00 at night.Which you know is a very busy time, walking up Broadway, up to 6th Avenue, over here on the 5th and up to Trump Tower. We have seen so many people and a few more coming back. Now we've seen a lot more leave. In order to keep this more civil and to keep it safe for the kids we want to talk to someone here, named Anthony, who we pulled out of the crowd. Anthony you are out here protesting tonight. What is it that brought you out here specifically? What has angered you to bring you out here?ANTHONY, PROTESTER: I don't believe that Donald Trump is representing me and my peers honestly and -- Donald Trump is a (BEEP). Thank you.SCHMITT: I tried to have a civil conversation. You know I think part of the reason why a lot of people have a hard time taking this protests seriously is, because so many people behave that way. What are going to do? But there is obviously a lot of anger out here and we tried to get somebody for you and get somebody that has an intelligent conversation.  Didn't work too well, Megyn are you still there?KELLY: Rob, thank you. You know, that is the problem, people want us to listen to them and then they behave like that. Then we go away and move on to our guest, who knows how to behave. Earlier today, we saw college student burning flags on some campuses. While other schools, there are concerns that student were too traumatized to go to class. And the universities allowed them to skip.Jonathan Turley is a constitutional law attorney and Professor at George Washington Law, great to see you, professor. That is just sick. We have a series on this show called cupcake nation. This is exactly what I'm talking about. You tell me whether allowing students to skip classes in college, because they are so upset about an election completely misunderstands the purpose of college.JONATHAN TURLEY, GEORGE WASHINGTON SCHOOL OF LAW: I think it does. You know, there is a same response after the Ferguson, Missouri, a protest and some faculty say you don't have to take tests or come to school. And this is the point. You know, in college you learned a lot about being a citizen. And the burning of the flag these protests is really ignorant and hateful act. You know that flag speaks to rights not to results. You can't say that you like the Democratic process, but only if it comes out your way. It is like saying, I like going to baseball games, but only for the score.What is being missed here particularly with the student, and particularly concerned with law student, is that we are raising a generation of emotional Hemophilia, you know that if legal or political things don't go your way, if something upset you, you sort of have a modern version of the vapors. And that is not a good thing for us to support. I mean, if you feel that anger, if you feel hurt, then it should be used as a motivation to learn more, to get out there, and to do things.KELLY: The vapors, I love that and especially when you think about law student. Law student who cannot function in the face of what they perceive as injustice. You get it? You get the irony? A law student who cannot -- ok, good luck in the actual practice of law. It is not going to work out too well for you.TURLEY: I had to say, at George Washington, a lot of my students were upset with the results. They were in class. They were fired up, and that is good. There are some students that celebrated the results last night, others denounced it. But they were all in class. And that is the important thing. I did give students off yesterday, so they can participate in the election.KELLY: Well, that a different story. That is a different story all together. But we are seeing this festering of this cupcake nation, which I would submit to you is, actually one of the reasons why Donald Trump got elected. People are sick of this kind of, you know you can't say a word that is potentially offensive. And that would include any discussion of social issues on college campuses. It has gone to an extreme. All right, let me ask you whether you think, because you have been very vocal and you actually had a role in challenging some of Barack Obama's executive actions as president. You tell me whether you think last night's results were a repudiation of some of those executive overreaches of his.TURLEY: I think it was in part. I mean first of all we do have to remember that voters were quite clear with the Democratic Party that they did not want an established figure. And they went out and found the ultimate establishment figure. They also said they did not want a vote for Hillary Clinton. She had many negatives. And so the results in that sense shouldn't be particularly astonishing.But I do think that there was this growing disconnect between citizens and their government. You know when Barack Obama was pushing forward his agenda as he had every right to do. He tried to change congress and failed. The Republicans actually fought off that challenge. And when he came back, he said, that he would go unilaterally. That he would go it alone. And I think that I for a lot of citizens made them think I really don't count. And in fact, they haven't counted much until last night.Whatever you may think about this election, whatever you may think about Donald Trump, and this is a popular response of the American people. They want to count. And they did last night. Now, you know, so I think that what we have to do is first of all, honor the system, the Democratic choice that was made, and we can have disagreements. We can have passionate disagreements. But we also have to stay in the game and respect each other enough to say we have a good system and it swings like a pendulum. But we still stay committed to each other and to that system.KELLY: And we are proud of our system. We are proud of it.TURLEY: You should be.KELLY: You may not like the results every time, but it works and it works usually quite beautifully. Jonathan Turley, great to see you, thanks for being here.TURLEY: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: So the big question for so many today, what was the deal with all the polls? Virtually all of -- all but two, and had Hillary Clinton with a comfortable lead going into last night's election.Chris Stirewalt and our chief number cruncher is in Michigan, my buddy from the decision desk, are here next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Donald Trump has been president-elect for almost 24 hours now. And folks are still talking about what happened with the polls running up to this race. The popular vote tally right now, Mrs. Clinton is up by one-fifth of one point, but the national polling average just hours before voting booths opened had Clinton up by three point. And going into last night the exit polls were suggesting that Mrs. Clinton was headed to comfortable win. Fox News Decision Desk Team Members are for accountability -- no, they weren't the pollsters. They weren't the pollsters, but first, we turn to Trace Gallagher, live in New York City for some of the details; Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, some analyst are now trying to sugar coat the outcome by claiming the polls really weren't that far off in that polling errors of three percent or pretty common. Of course in a presidential race, three percent is a boat load of votes and some of the key battle ground state polling averages was off by more than three percent. In fact Wisconsin was off by 7.5. Ohio was off by 5 percent, Michigan by just under 4 and Pennsylvania was off by 3. But Larry Sabato wasn't about to sugar coat his crystal ball. He called the polls an industry wide failure that is going to be quote studied up the wazoo. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LARRY SABATO, UVA'S CENTER FOR POLITICS DIRECTOR: We were wrong, OK? The entire punditry, industry, the entire polling industry, the entire analyst industry, and I want to use this opportunity to take my fair share of the blame. We were wrong.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: The American Association for Public Opinion Research agreed with the Dr. Sabato but not everyone got it wrong. The USCLA Times poll which was largely dismissed had been seeing a wave of Trump support for months and for most of the summer and fall the L.A. Times poll was giving Trump about six points more than the polling averages.The same poll also said Trump's odds of winning will come down to how he mobilizes white voters especially white men. And interestingly it found that Trump voters, especially women, were less comfortable telling pollsters they supported Trump. The Investor's Business Daily TIP poll also predicted a Trump victory. The man who runs that poll says despite Democrats having more registered voters across the country, he thought GOP turnout would be equal, because they're simply was more enthusiasm, Megyn?KELLY: Trace, thank you.Two members of our team The Fox News Decision Desk are here with me, Chris Stirewalt, a Fox News Digital Politics Editor and Arnon Mishkin, Director of the Fox News Decision Desk, the director is here. Mr. Director, in a line or two, what was it? Why was this, essentially missed? I realize that there is margin of error. Skip that nonsense. What happened?ARNON MISHKIN, FOX NEWS DECISION DESK DIRECTOR: I think what was missed, was the implications of the poll. The polls, all the polls, I think, actually accurately provided information about the electorate and what was missed, was missed by analyst reading those poll numbers and saying, what does that mean? What was going on all year long or all season long since the conventions, Hillary Clinton and most polls was floating at 45 percent.  Donald Trump was floating at around 38 to 40 percent. When Donald Trump didn't do well in three debates, when he got into a fight with Miss Universe, he would sink three or four points, in that average. And Clinton didn't go up at all.KELLY: And what should that have told everyone?MISHKIN: That should have told everybody that if you're not with Hillary Clinton now, what piece of information could you provide someone to get them to go with Clinton? And if you ever tried to tell that to someone they tell you, you're doing Trump spin. And I would argue that, the people who sort of were focused on the difference rather than focused on that Clinton number were not doing Trump's -- they were doing Trump spin, because they were making people think that there's no doubt Clinton is going to win and that, I think, dampened her turnout.KELLY: But was there in fact the shy Trump voter? There was, wasn't there?CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DECISION DESK: There are always shy voters.KELLY: No, no, no, but this was something that was a question going into last night. Whether there was a shy Trump voter the pollsters weren't getting to and results last night proved the answer was yes.STIREWALT: No.KELLY: Yes.STIREWALT: No.KELLY: Yes.STIREWALT: Then there were shy Obama voters in 2012. And there were shy Clinton voters this time around too.KELLY: The untold story, this is Rove earlier tonight. Untold stories the defection avoids to third Party or the failure to vote. Do you agree with that?STIREWALT: I think the biggest story in the election of all is that in counties, in the upper Midwest, in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, that you had counties that had turnarounds of 20 points.  You have people who are voting for Barack Obama in 2012, white voters, middle class white voters turning around and voting 20 point turnarounds in these counties. It is not that they were shy. It is they were telling us, they were there, they were available. We caught the vote.KELLY: The undecideds weren't undecided. That is what the write-up said today. They were secretly for Trump and they didn't want to say it. Is that wrong? Did you read those write-ups?MISHKIN: I actually agree with that.KELLY: Aha! Go ahead.(LAUGHTER)MISHKIN: I think the undecided voter, they decided one thing, they weren't voting for Clinton.KELLY: Right.STIREWALT: I agree with that.And that they were trying.KELLY: Those are the shy Trump voters.STIREWALT: But what I am saying is, every year, every four years, the problem that I have is that right now, Larry Sabato, my dear friend, Trace, everybody says, the polls were a disaster. Guess what, if the polls were a disaster this year? They were even worse in 2012, because they missed it by a larger margin.KELLY: Ok. We're fine with that too.(LAUGHTER)MISHKIN: I'm not sure they were so shy as much as they were very skeptical about Clinton. They weren't ready to vote for her.STIREWALT: Right.MISHKIN: And I think if you were in the middle and you were convinced that some of the stuff Donald Trump was saying was correct. But you had some skepticism about, some of the temperament issue, if the conventional wisdom is there is no doubt Clinton is going to win, a person like that has no trouble voting for Trump to express their position.KELLY: And they did.MISHKIN: Exactly.KELLY: Thanks to you, both, great job, both of you. It's been a pleasure.  STIREWALT: Thank you.MISHKIN: Thank you.KELLY: Last word of the night goes to a woman who spent the last 15 months fighting night and day for Donald Trump. She is live, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people, and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen.(APPLAUSE)(CHEERS)We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations. Willing.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That was Donald Trump roughly 18 hours ago sharing some of his plans after learning he had finally won a long and hard fought race for the White House. Our next guest has been on the broadcast for almost every step of that race. So we wanted to finish tonight with Katrina Pierson, now former national spokesperson for the Trump campaign and Richard Fowler, a Fox News contributor and senior fellow for the New Leaders Counsel.Kat, let's start with you and congratulations on what a win last night. I can only imagine what it was like for you watching it with team Trump. Your thoughts on what voters were telling America yesterday.KATRINA PIERSON, FORMER NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN:  Well, I think the voters unlike those inside the Beltway saw the genius in Donald Trump. And the fact that he was such a gifted speaker that he spoke directly to them, bypassed the media and bypassed really all of the pollsters and really talked to them about what was important to them.These voters have been out there, they've been frustrated, because their health care premiums are going up. We have a president and a Congress, and an elected officials really, who haven't been putting their interests first. Always had been more money to even terrorist nations, but nothing here for those who those who are hardworking. And they understood that, they know that Donald Trump wants to fight for them. I've been on this show many times and very confident that Donald Trump is going to be the next president of the United States and he was going to get some of the minority vote and he did better than Mitt Romney in that area as well.KELLY: He did slightly better. Richard, your thoughts, did Katrina just nail it? I mean do you disagree with anything she just said?RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND SENIOR FELLOW FOR THE NEW LEADERS COUNSEL: I got to tell you, Megyn, it is very rare that I agree with Katrina, but I do. I think want Donald Trump showed is that he really had a conversation with the American people. And I think one thing the Democrats can learn from this after this 18 months of a crazy campaign, because a lot of Democrats tonight that are hurt. Half of the country that Donald Trump will now have to run doesn't like him. But we have to learn as progressives and Democrats is how to have conviction and argument. What I will give Donald Trump that I didn't think you saw from the Clinton campaign and Democrats is we waffled on some of the issues that really affect our base.KELLY: You think we chose the right candidate? One who inspired demes?FOWLER: No, I mean, I think that is part of it, Megyn. We picked a candidate we talked about over and over about raising a minimum wage.  Hillary Clinton changed how much the minimum wage should be raised three times. Instead of saying, I am for $15 an hour, point blank period, that is where the movement, that is where I am.KELLY: No he doesn't Richard. You know, Democrats were reluctant to nominate her. They were thinking too serious about Bernie and meantime she was getting debate questions fed to her and the establishment of the DNC side was helping her win.Katrina, we got 30 second left. I will give you the last word.PIERSON: Well, I just want to thank you. You know, you were the first one to congratulate me on air once I had this appointment. I have been honored to serve Mr. Trump and his family on this journey, because we are going to make America great again.KELLY: You are very gracious. It has been a pleasure having you.PIERSON: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: Thanks for working with us throughout the primary season and general election. Thanks to both of you. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, ""KELLY, LIVE!""/ABC)KELLY RIPA, HOST: You know who has been great today?  Megyn Kelly. Yeah.KELLY: Thank you very much.RIPA: Last 24 hours. And Megyn has a book coming out on November 15th.  Did you all know this? Megyn has a book called ""Settle for More"" and speak about a good side. They captured it on the cover.KELLY: Oh, thank you, the magic of retouching. Comes out this Tuesday, I'm going on your competitor, I guess, Dr. Phil.RIPA: OK.KELLY: Because the book title is based on his saying the only difference between you and someone you envy is, you settled for less, so settle for more is my life philosophy. It helped me a lot.RIPA: Yeah. The motto around here, just settle.KELLY: You will never know.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Kelly Ripa could not have been nicer. She was so sweet and her entire team was very sweet. And it was the first time at my life I have ever sat at the anchor desk and thrown confetti, using a confetti wand at the audience. I think we need to incorporate this.Sean Hannity, he's going to be doing it, when he comes off in 30 seconds, he is in that place, right now.SEAN HANNITY, HOST, ""HANNITY"": I came in in happy mood. I just said, anything happen in the last 24 hours?KELLY: He got the confetti going. I have never seen him so happy. Look at that smile.HANNITY: Oh my god, million dollar smile, because we will now have some more money in our pocket. Ow.KELLY: You know what though, seriously, I congratulate Katrina Pierson.  Congrats to you too, Sean, because you were way out there.HANNITY: Oh, I was way out there.KELLY: And it was a great victory for you and for Donald Trump.
