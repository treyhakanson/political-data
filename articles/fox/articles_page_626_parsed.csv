Austria's coalition is made up of Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party.He added that the attacks in 2001 changed the world, and he wanted to send a bold statement. ""Sometimes, you have to present an exaggerated view of the situation if you really want to make a point,"" Kienbauer told the newspaper Kronen Zeitung.But many say Kienbauer's creation is in poor taste, calling it offensive and ""unbelievable."" More than 2,900 people died on Sept. 11, 2001.(Translation from RT: Awful comparison! When one understands that he depicted 9/11 that claimed so many lives...)(Translation from RT: Social Democrats and People's Party as twin towers? the Greens and the Freedom Party as planes? 9/11 as cake? That's unbelievable!)(Translation RT: This pastry-cook tends to mix incompatible things. 9/11 + local elections in Vienna = WTF?)"	['Alexander']	['creation']
