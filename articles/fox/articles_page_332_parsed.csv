This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: The Malaysian airlines investigation zeroing in more and more on the crew. We're not finding out more about the pilot who was the support of a Malaysian opposition leader. And he was in court just hours before the takeoff as that leader was sentenced to prison. Any significance?Former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton joins us. Good evening, sir.JOHN BOLTON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR/FORMER UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: Good evening.VAN SUSTEREN: Any thought about the fact that the pilot was in court as this opposition leader was sentenced just a few hours takeoff mean anything to you?BOLTON: Well, Anwar Ibrahim who is the opposition leader in question, when he was in public office actually was relatively friendly to the United States, relatively modern and pro-western in his outlook. I mean, I think that's one of the reasons why the current government of Malaysia has been after him. So, at least if being in favor of Ibrahim has something that the pilot really honestly felt strongly about, I don't think that's gonna take us very far at least in political terms. Maybe it has psychological impact. But of course, that also doesn't answer the question, was this port merely a cover story, a reuse to hide the true inclinations the pilot and the co- pilot may have had. These are all questions that remain unanswered.VAN SUSTEREN: Should we read anything into the fact that apparently the opposition leader was sentenced, it was vacated, it was acquitted and this was sort of had gone around a little bit in the Malaysian court system, it was I think a sodomy charge he was convicted or reconvicted of. However, they call it. And he got five years for that, should we read anything into the process or the charge?BOLTON: Well, I think that the prosecution was political from the get-go. I mean, this is a code word for saying that accusing Ibrahim of being a homosexual which in a Muslim society obviously can bring a pretty severe penalty. So, I don't think there was much doubt from the beginning of the prosecution that it was politically motivated, which is why the opposition resisted it so strongly.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. Now, another part of the globe, President Obama today announcing sanctions against many of Putin's advisors. Not Putin himself but sanctions against 11, your thoughts on that? Is this getting tough on Putin or is this just nothing?BOLTON: Well, this is embarrassing by how weak it is. But sanctioning 11 individuals after weeks of talking about freezing assets? Do you think these people left any assets in the United States left to be frozen? And obviously, by not sanctioning Putin himself, that's a signal right there. If the administration wanted to use economic pressure on Russia, it has plenty of possibilities to do so. Stop Russian banks from operating in the United States. Tell Aeroflot to stop flying here. But to engage in these kinds of symbolic acts, not against the big oligarchs, not against the people with real money whose wives want to shop on Fifth Avenue, but against basically political figures in the Ukraine and Russia. It's really a pathetic performance.VAN SUSTEREN: So, on a 1 to 10 scale, 10 being the toughest and 1 being the weakest, how do you grade these sanctions in terms of toughness on Putin and having an impact on him to reverse himself.BOLTON: You are right down in the decimal point level. Look, I think this says to Putin I continue to have the high cards. I'm gonna continue to press ahead. I'm winning here and I don't see anything from the United States or from the European sanctions also announced today that they are gonna change that calculus in Putin's mind.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. If tomorrow Putin annexes Crimea, then what?BOLTON: Well, then he has got the Crimea. I think he thinks he is gonna get more than that. I still believe he aspires to a government in Kiev over the whole country that subservient to Russia. I think partition. And it wouldn't just be of the Crimea. It would be of the pro-Russian populations in eastern and southern Ukraine more generally. I think partition is still plan b. So, my guess is the next step is that Putin says overwhelming pro- Russian sentiments as the Crimea referendum demonstrates. And the government in Kiev has to recognize that. He is now ready to negotiate. Maybe to have the provinces have more autonomy from Kiev, but in any event to get the kind of government he wants, I think that's what he is still after.VAN SUSTEREN: Should we have seen this coming?BOLTON: Absolutely. Look, in April of 2008, the Bush administration proposed bringing Ukraine and Georgia on to a clear path to NATO membership. And the reason was obvious. They were left in a strategic vacuum in central Europe between NATO and Russia. And what Bush wanted to do was to tie them more firmly to the west. The Europeans fearing the Russian reaction rejected the idea. I think Putin and the Russians took very careful note of that. They invaded Georgia four months after Europe backed away from the Bush administration proposal. And the Obama administration has had five years to consider the strategic significance of the European decision and the invasion of Georgia and what its implications would be for Ukraine. They have done nothing for five years. So, my criticism of the Obama White House is a lot less what they've done or not done in the past 30 days. It's what they have not done to get ready for this for five years.VAN SUSTEREN: Does this have any impact on our continuing problems with Iran and Syria?BOLTON: Yes. I think this is yet another demonstration of American weakness. We've been saying with respect to Syria for three years incorrectly that we have a common interest with Russia in a peaceful transition away from the Assad regime. That's never been the Russian interest. They want Assad in power. He is their only Arab ally at the moment. And I think in Tehran they must be looking at this performance by the United States and Europe on a European country watching Putin push us around and concluding that they can do the same in the nuclear negotiation. They broken through on economic sanctions, their nuclear weapons program continues almost unabated. I think they now see that there is real weakness in the west and they will press against it.VAN SUSTEREN: Ambassador, thank you, sir.BOLTON: Thank you."	['Obama']	[]

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: President Obama hitting the road today from Boston to Miami, out hustling for money. No, not to pay down the national debt, but for his party and his pals. These were all fund-raisers. Good timing or is it bad timing?Former senator Rick Santorum joins us. Good evening, sir.RICK SANTORUM, FORMER SENATOR/FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: How are you, Greta?VAN SUSTEREN: I'm very well. And presidents of both parties spend a lot of time fund-raising, help build up the party, help win different -- the House or the Senate back, whatever it might be.But today, the president hitting three. Bad timing for him, or it just doesn't matter in terms of he's going to do it sometime? They all do.SANTORUM: Well, I don't think it's a good time in the midst of all of these scandals. But it really is the way the president operates. I mean, the president likes to be out of Washington. He likes to go out and raise money and play politics. I mean, that's -- that's what he's very good at. He's very accomplished at it.He doesn't -- doesn't particularly care to micromanage things in Washington. He doesn't particularly like to take responsibility for the things that are going on there. And so if he stays out and he gets into the political realm, gets in campaign mode and can fire up his troops and continue keep his base energized, that's really, I think, the ultimate game plan here.VAN SUSTEREN: You know, I guess it's the sort of the visual about fund-raising, but I suspect on the flight from Boston to Miami on Air Force One -- it's a fully equipped White House -- I mean, that I assume that he's doing some business. Would you not assume there was some business is going on?SANTORUM: Oh, I'm sure. Look, I mean, the president's obviously -- we all are, not just the president, we're all in constant touch. That's part of our problem as a society is that we're -- we're always on and we're always available, and certainly, the president is no different than that.But look, when you're out there on the campaign trail, is what he's doing right now, you're focused on the campaign. I mean, when you're on Air Force One, I suspect that there'll be candidates who will be on the plane with him, will be visiting with him, will talking about the next event. And so you're out there on the stump, which is he is today, you're going to be fairly concerned with what's going on in your day. You're not going to be paying a whole lot of attention to minutias that's happening in Washington.VAN SUSTEREN: Do you see any indication he's sort of hands-on in terms of looking at these different scandals or alleged scandals that are developing, or is he trying to keep some distance and (INAUDIBLE) smart and just sort of let them play out, as they may very well be, or should he be doing something?SANTORUM: Well, I mean, it's -- you know, the president's reaction, every time a new scandal comes in -- Well, I didn't know anything about it. I mean, I -- I mean, who me? I mean, I -- you know, this is all news to me.I mean, he is the -- you know, he is the antithesis, unfortunately, of a great Democratic president when it came to the issue of responsibility, Harry Truman, who said the buck stops here, and there is absolutely no buck stopping anywhere near President Obama's desk, in his opinion, that if there's something going wrong in the administration, it's somebody else's fault. And he hops out on the campaign trail to make that point, to rally his base and say he's being treated unfairly and get his people all energized to storm Capitol Hill.VAN SUSTEREN: What difference does it make to him? He can't -- he can't run for president again. He's in his second term. As far as we can see, that health care is going forward, although I -- you know, we do anticipate lots of problems. Those exchanges aren't set up. And of course, there are a lot of people complaining about rates going up. And there's, you know, some people like some of the health care. They like some aspects of it. But some really hate it.What difference do all of these sort of scandals even make to the president?SANTORUM: Well, I think you make -- you make a very good point, Greta, that there's going to be something that's going to overwhelm all these scandals here in the next few months, and that is the implementation of ""Obama care."" And you know, maybe what he's doing is raising money because, you know, they're going to have to fight back.You're going to see huge premium increases. You're going to see people are going to lose their insurance. You're going to see, you know, horrific situations with businesses dropping their insurance.This is going to be a nightmare for the Obama administration. You're right, states are not going to be ready with these exchanges. It's going to be a problem.And maybe what the president's doing is really smart in the sense that he's going out there, raising money to be able to battle what he knows is going to be really the Waterloo for him in politics and certainly for the 2014 election, which is astronomical health care -- health insurance increases, a drop in the number of insured, and a real destabilization of the economy that's going to come as a result of that.So maybe this is just his way of preparing for it. And he sees, I think, maybe realistically, that these scandals are short-term and ""ObamaCare"" is a long-term problem for him.VAN SUSTEREN: You know, I always sort of -- also, we all -- you know, we talk about people's rates going up and what businesses, but there are also a lot of people who work at sort of businesses especially like fast food or something, where their hours may get cut so that they come under the threshold...SANTORUM: Yes. Sure.VAN SUSTEREN: ... or a business that may have 49 employees may put a hold at 49 employees so it doesn't, you know, rise above a threshold. So there's -- there's also a little bit of a damper around the margins for certain people and it's -- and it -- you know, it could be very painful for them.SANTORUM: There's no question that people will lose their insurance as a result of this. People will lose -- as you mentioned, they'll lose their jobs as a result of this or they won't be hired as a result of companies refusing to grow. People will get part-time jobs instead of full-time jobs.And of course, you're going to have the people who have insurance are going to see tremendous increases or they're going to see their insurance be cut and having to go off into these exchanges, which everything I hear - - and I talk to a lot of insurance companies because I'm trying to stay on top of this as much as I can.And they're telling me, you know, the schedule the Obama administration has for the implementation, just the -- the technology that they're trying to implement to process claims and to -- and to -- and to distribute -- to do benefits simply it cannot work in the timeframe that they're suggesting. This could be a major disaster for the administration coming forward!VAN SUSTEREN: All right, you served in the Senate. Let me ask you a quick question on Clapper. We only have 30 seconds left -- and his exchange with Senator Wyden. Do you think Mr. Clapper is the best for the job?SANTORUM: Look, I think the president has put in people who are politically attuned to the president, who -- and have been very good in apologizing for this president and shilling for him but are not the best people to do the job. There's no question in my mind about that.VAN SUSTEREN: Does that mean Clapper should go?SANTORUM: Well, if...(CROSSTALK)VAN SUSTEREN: Do you have any problem with his testimony before -- if his testimony was false before -- before the Senate, and I think it was false -- I don't know what you think -- should he go?SANTORUM: Well, I think Eric Holder's testimony was false, too! I mean, let's fire the attorney general.VAN SUSTEREN: Should both go?SANTORUM: Well, look, if your -- if -- if you -- if there is an actual case of your lying to Congress, obviously, the president should consider whether they want people who have perjured themself before Congress in their cabinet. I certainly wouldn't want anybody who's done that in my cabinet.VAN SUSTEREN: Does that -- is that sort of an easy, soft way to say they should -- they should be gone?SANTORUM: Well, lets put it this way. I wouldn't have any perjurer in my cabinet! And I wouldn't want people to come and lie on behalf of this -- of my administration before -- before the Congress. And I would think a president who campaigned on being the most honest, ethical and transparent president in the history of the country would immediately act on such -- on such -- such testimony.VAN SUSTEREN: Senator, thank you, sir.SANTORUM: My pleasure."
