This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to ""Hannity."" And tonight, we're just one week away from the New York primaries. On the Republican side, 95 delegates are at stake. And tonight, at the ""Hannity"" big board with a look at some brand- new polls and the GOP delegate count is our very own ""Fox & Friends"" Heather Nauert -- Heather.HEATHER NAUERT, ""FOX & FRIENDS"": Hi.HANNITY: Big polls coming out today.HANNITY: We certainly do. Hi, there, Sean. Hi there to all of you.Republican front-runner Donald Trump leading the polls in his home state of New York. According to a brand-new Quinnipiac poll out of the Empire State, Trump is on top with 55 percent, Girlfriend John Kasich second with 20 percent, and Senator Ted Cruz follows in third with 19 percent.Now, in a New York 1 Baruch College poll, Trump has an even bigger lead with 60 percent, and then it's Kasich in second with 17 percent and Cruz in third with 14 percent.Sean, Trump has been campaigning hard in his home state, and if these poll numbers hold, it would mean that he would win potentially all of New York's 95 Republican delegates.And we're also learning more about Senator Ted Cruz's strategy. According to new reports, his campaign is focusing heavily on California, yesterday, during a rally in that state, Cruz telling supporters that voters in California will end up deciding the Republican nominee, both New York and California delegate-rich states, and that would make a big difference in the overall delegate count.Here is where that stands right now, Trump leading with 755 delegates.  Cruz has been making gains, though, recently. He sits at 545. Kasich has 143 delegates.That New York primary a week from today, and we will watch all of those developments closely. Sean, back to you.HANNITY: All right, Heather, thanks so much.NAUERT: Thanks.HANNITY: And here now with reaction, former New York City mayor and prosecutor in his own right, Rudy Giuliani. Mr. Mayor, how are you?RUDY GIULIANI, R-FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: How are you, Sean? Good to see you.HANNITY: All right, so it's a close delegate count. You've got 755 to 545.GIULIANI: Right.HANNITY: But I would say advantage Trump in New York, obviously, based on those polls.GIULIANI: Yes, those polls are I think pretty solid, too. I think 55 is a bottom number. Could be higher than that.HANNITY: So you think he gets all congressional districts and probably get most of the 95, if not all?GIULIANI: Yes. I think he gets most of the 95, if not all of them. That gives him a nice -- a nice cushion.HANNITY: So then he's up 300 delegates, and then Pennsylvania's up by a big margin. He's up in Maryland by a big margin. Delaware, Connecticut, Rhode Island -- where do they go?GIULIANI: Should be good states for him.HANNITY: Yes.GIULIANI: I would say good states for him, not such good states for Cruz.  And that's why I think Cruz is concentrating on California, and Trump is going to have to make a big effort in California. There's no reason why Trump couldn't be a good candidate in California. The California Republican Party's not too different than the New York Republican Party.HANNITY: Yes.GIULIANI: And maybe a little more conservative, but I think Trump can make a good showing in California.HANNITY: Do you see -- what if he falls short of 1,237? How does he get there?GIULIANI: Then I think it depends on how short he is of 1,237. If he's a few votes short of 1,237, he probably can pick up the delegates to go over the top.HANNITY: Define ""a few"" because ""a few"" means 100? Does it mean 50?GIULIANI: 20, 30.HANNITY: 20, 30.GIULIANI: Yes.HANNITY: Otherwise, it's a contested convention. Don't you think -- I think Paul Ryan said earlier today that this should not -- that he's not going to run in this race, that we shouldn't be talking about anybody other than people that have run in the race. Do you agree with that?GIULIANI: I agree with that. I agree that these people have worked, you know, for a year at it. They've laid out their program for the public.  People have voted. They've got thousands of votes. So I think the pick has to be between them.HANNITY: We're going to get into this battle of what happened in Colorado.  Donald Trump said earlier tonight that the GOP should be -- the RNC should be ashamed of themselves on the process. Now, the people in Colorado didn't vote, but everyone knew the rules going in. Ted Cruz outworked everybody in Colorado, got all the delegates available there.GIULIANI: Yes. I mean, I think the way to look at it is, it makes one of the points that Trump has been trying to make, and actually that Cruz has been trying to make, that this is -- that this is an elite-dominated political party with a grass roots that wants to go the other way. And Colorado decided to go kind of a back-door way.HANNITY: But when people like prominent Republicans, like Karl Rove says we need a fresh face, not somebody who's run, or John Boehner mentioned Paul Ryan specifically -- you can nominate anyone on the convention floor...GIULIANI: Then why should we have primaries?HANNITY: That's what I say.GIULIANI: Ever.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: It should really be Cruz or Trump right now, right?GIULIANI: Right. If you consider -- if you put Cruz and Trump together, they basically are the vast majority of the Republican Party that bothered to vote. And what did they say to us? They said to us...HANNITY: No establishment.GIULIANI: ... We don't want one of those insiders they're going to pull out of their hat.HANNITY: Yes.GIULIANI: And -- and...HANNITY: Do you think they'll ever get along? Right now, it is as -- it's getting mean out there. Don't you think Republicans at the end of the -- this contest are going to have to unite? And I don't see that happening right now. I see a lot of antipathy, resentment.GIULIANI: Well, I don't see it happening if they try to pull a rabbit out of a hat and...HANNITY: Yes.GIULIANI: ... you know, try to put somebody in who hasn't been in the race, hasn't been making the case, hasn't gone through everything they've gone through. If it comes down to a choice between Trump and Cruz, I think they can probably put it together...HANNITY: You do?GIULIANI: ... the two of them. Yes, I think they can.HANNITY: You do?GIULIANI: Yes, I do.HANNITY: All right. You're on.GIULIANI: Look at what Donald is saying...HANNITY: I'm interviewing these guys, so I'm not sure I see the love in the room.GIULIANI: No, look at what Donald's been saying about Marco Rubio.HANNITY: Well, that's true.GIULIANI: As opposed to what he was saying about him two months ago.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: Yes. Good point. All right, Mr. Mayor, good to see you.GIULIANI: Thank you.HANNITY: Thank you.And joining us now, former Texas governor and Ted Cruz supporter Rick Perry. Governor, how are you, sir?RICK PERRY, R-FMR. TEXAS GOVERNOR: I'm great. And I do agree with America's mayor on that last statement.HANNITY: You know, the funny thing is -- we were just talking before we came on. We both agreed you would have been a pretty good president.(LAUGHTER)PERRY: Well, Rudy would have made a pretty good candidate, too, back in the day, but that's not the way it turned out. So you know, that is that, and let's look towards the future here. And it's going to be between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Listen, it's -- anything else is completely out of the realm of possibility, in my belief.HANNITY: In my opinion, too. Then why are all these prominent Republican names that I just mentioned suggesting otherwise?PERRY: Well, we got to have something to talk about. So I think that's what driving it, as much as anything, an interesting media story to pitch all these out here. But the fact is that you're going to have -- and I don't think that anybody's going to get to 1,237. I think we will go to a contested convention. And I don't have a problem with that. I mean, everybody knew what the rules were when they signed up on this. And I think as long as we follow the rules and they don't try to back-door somebody, then Donald Trump or Ted Cruz -- and I think...HANNITY: But Governor, here's a little...PERRY: ... California's going to be a really interesting place to see...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Here's a real big problem, though. The rules for 2016 haven't been written yet. They won't be written until just before the convention.PERRY: Well, I don't think there's going to be a big rule changes. I think, you know, Reince Priebus would be making a huge mistake and I think the Rules Committee would be making a huge mistake if they go in there and try to make big changes. If they tweak them a little bit, maybe -- you know, probably live with that. But if they go in and make some big rule changes on rule 40, I think you got some -- I think you have some problems that could be very, very dangerous at the end of the day.HANNITY: By the way, Mr. -- Rudy Giuliani is still here. He wants to weigh in and say hello to you. Is that OK?(LAUGHTER)GIULIANI: Hi, Rick. How are you doing?PERRY: I'm fine, Mr. Mayor. Everything's good in Texas. We miss you.GIULIANI: I miss you, too. I agree with you. I think if they make rules changes that are substantive, that substantially change the rules on which these men and women -- one woman, were running, it would be really, really unfair. And I also think we risk ruining our party, at least for this election.PERRY: Yes.HANNITY: Big time.PERRY: I don't think that's going to happen. Listen, even if we go to a contested convention, which I do think we will go there and we're going to see these candidates working within the rule structure, and at the end of the day, whether it's Donald Trump or whether it's Ted Cruz -- and certainly, I hope it's Ted Cruz -- we'll come together and go forward to defeat Hillary Clinton.I mean, that's -- you know, at the end of the day, we're throwing lot of elbows. There's a lot of things going on. You know, people have said this about New York, people have said this about Texas and -- we're Americans, and that's what's really important at the end of the day.We're going to have a candidate that we can get behind, a nominee that's going to be clearly the conservative choice, and we put America back on track again.HANNITY: Let me ask you...PERRY: And I happen to think Ted Cruz is that person.HANNITY: Let's say candidate A, candidate B -- candidate A goes into the convention with having won more states, millions more votes and hundreds of more delegates, but doesn't get the nomination.Do you worry at that point -- and I'll ask both of you the question -- that the person that was bypassed because they didn't get to 1,237 and lose in a contested convention -- do you think their supporters would be, Governor Perry?PERRY: Well, I think it's like if we go into overtime at a basketball game and your team was...HANNITY: But they weren't tied.PERRY: But the point is, let's play this out. I mean, you're wanting to call the game in the fourth quarter with two minutes to go in the game.I mean, people understand rules. And I think just because you don't like the way the rules are turning out for you, for you to throw a fit and whine and to go on and on about it, is, you know, pretty immature, in my opinion.  Let's play this out. Here's the rules. You knew what they were before you got in the thing.HANNITY: Mayor?PERRY: So let's play it out.GIULIANI: I think Rick is correct. I think we should play it by the rules. I think if you get a candidate within 20 or 30 votes and they don't get it, then you got a chance of a really disgruntled group of people that you can't get together. You have a margin of -- a couple of hundred, that's it. That's it...(CROSSTALK)PERRY: But Rudy, I think it's really important if you...(CROSSTALK)GIULIANI: ... Rick is correct. If that happens, then I think everybody feels they were treated fairly, and whether the first or the second guy wins, we both have to -- I mean, I support Trump. My good friend Rick supports Cruz. But I support Cruz if Cruz is the nominee of the party.HANNITY: Governor, last word.PERRY: Well, and I think it's really important -- if you're that close, and you can't close the deal, shame on you.HANNITY: All right. We'll leave it there. Guys, thank you both for being with us. Appreciate it.GIULIANI: Thank you.PERRY: Good to be with you.HANNITY: We'll see you both soon.Coming up next tonight on a busy news night on ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Our Republican system is absolutely rigged! It's a phony deal!SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald has been yelling and screaming, a lot of whining.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump, Senator Ted Cruz battling for every GOP delegate.  Trump's convention manager will join us coming up next.Then, Laura Ingraham is here to weigh in on the battle for New York.Plus, tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, D-NEW YORK CITY: Sorry, Hillary. I was running on CP time.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's not -- I don't -- I don't like jokes like that (INAUDIBLE)(LAUGHTER)HILLARY CLINTON, D- PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Cautious politician time.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Racially charged so-called joke everyone's talking about that Hillary Clinton and Comrade Mayor de Blasio of New York crossed the line.  That and more straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" It's now official, Senator Ted Cruz swept all 34 delegates in Colorado following a complex delegate selection procedure. In response, well, Donald Trump is slamming the GOP nominating process. Here's what he said earlier tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The system's rigged! And I'll tell you what. When you look at Colorado -- and people can say, Oh, well, that's the way the game's played -- look, they should have had an election.  They didn't have an election.That system is set up so that the crooked politicians can make sure they get somebody in that's not, you know, part of what we're doing. This is a movement, folks. I'm self-funding my campaign. They hate it. And I'll tell you why. The RNC, the Republican National Committee, they should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this kind of crap to happen!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Now, Senator Ted Cruz -- he responded to Trump's complaints.  Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald has been yelling and screaming, a lot of whining, I'm sure some cursing, and some late-night fevered tweeting, all the characteristics I would note, we would want of a commander-in-chief.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Now, yesterday, RNC chairman Reince Priebus attempted to ease tensions by tweeting, quote, ""The rules were set last year. Nothing mysterious, nothing new. The rules have not changed. The rules are the same, nothing different.""Here now is the man that is tasked with securing Trump delegates. Donald Trump's convention manager, Paul Manafort, is with us. Do you really want to jump into this mess? Congratulations.PAUL MANAFORT, TRUMP CONVENTION MANAGER: It may look like a mess, but I like the position we're in.HANNITY: Yes. You were there in '76...MANAFORT: I was.HANNITY: ... at the contested convention. That was Ronald Reagan challenging a sitting president. It was a pretty amazing story, right?MANAFORT: It was quite a story. And there was -- there's a lot of deja vu going on.HANNITY: You feel it. All right, let's talk about Colorado, issue of contention. Is it rigged? Is it corrupt?MANAFORT: The point that Donald Trump was making is that the process in Colorado was being abused. And you know, it's not that the rules themselves were unknown. It's the way the rules were applied, the way they -- and then number of instances where ballots were not allowed to be counted because the numbers were wrong and they were all wrong and only people that related to...HANNITY: Is that the 378, 378, not 379?MANAFORT: Yes. The thing is, if it was only in Colorado, then you'd say it was just, you know, just unorganized. But we're seeing the same mistakes in Colorado, in Missouri and in a couple of -- Louisiana. And so the mistakes are not really mistakes. It's a pattern.HANNITY: A pattern of what?MANAFORT: A pattern of, at the local levels, abusing the amateurness of the enthusiasm of Republicans who want to participate in the process and are being cut out by back room tactics that -- as the hallmark of the Cruz campaign.I mean, he got caught with Carson in Iowa. He caught with Rubio in Florida. And he's going to get caught in all these places in...HANNITY: So you think Ted Cruz is doing this. Do you have any evidence that he is?MANAFORT: We are compiling evidence. We're going to be filing several credentials challenges. And -- you know, and, you know, whether we win on the challenges or not, the point is what's happening is -- if you go to these meetings and you're not a Cruz supporter, you don't want to be a Republican when you leave because (INAUDIBLE) so abused.HANNITY: You know, I would like this. I'm a big believer states should be able to do what they choose. I don't -- but it is a national party, so I think there ought to be some basics. If you want to have a caucus, have a caucus. You want to have a primary, have a primary. If you want to have proportional distribution, have proportional distribution. If you want winner takes all, winner takes all.But the idea that the people don't vote and participate troubles me. This has nothing to do with Colorado. Just in general, there's -- I think the people have to participate and that their will must be reflected in the end. Is that...MANAFORT: And that's what Donald Trump is talking about. He's talked about the rigged economy. He's talked about the rigged banking system, and now he's talking about the rigged political system. And what he's saying is that through his candidacy, he's going to try and bring clarity to all of this, get rid of the unfairness of it, and in politics, and his position is not much different than yours.We're playing by the rules, and we're winning by the rules. And you know, one of the distortions that the Cruz campaign is trying to put out there is that he's winning delegates. No, he's not winning delegates. He's winning bodies in some of these place with some of these factors (ph).HANNITY: He's also, apparently -- according to reports, he's working on Trump delegates for a second ballot, that they would switch to him. Is he...(CROSSTALK)MANAFORT: That's what I mean. He's not turning any Trump delegates who are delegates. What he's trying to do is put Cruz people in place of elected -- of Trump delegates' spots that have been mandated by the elections.And so the reality is, Colorado was a difficult, unique situation. But in places like Louisiana, we're going to have the Trump vote cast as the Trump vote. Some of that vote is going to be actually people who support Donald Trump. It should all be, but it's not going to be. Some of it are going to be people who support Cruz who are going to have to vote for Trump.Now, mind you, this is a round world, and there's going to be some places where, you know, we're going to have the same type of thing, and I'll call attention to Nevada in about...HANNITY: But what about 50-some-odd delegates from Pennsylvania unbound?MANAFORT: Those are fair game for everybody, and everybody's going to be working on them. But the point I guess that I want to stress is the whole premise of the Cruz campaign of a second ballot misses the point. There's not going to be a second ballot.HANNITY: Right now, Donald Trump would need 61 percent of delegates to win the nomination. If it's needed in terms of remaining bound delegates, it's 66 percent. For Ted Cruz, it's 97 percent of bound delegates remaining, not unbound. For Kasich, it's 150 percent.Right now, it's 755 to 545, 210, but you do have New York coming up. I would assume you expect most of the delegates in New York.MANAFORT: Not only in New York, but the whole Northeast. I mean, we're out of Cruz-land. Cruz is not even going to be finishing second for the next couple of weeks. He's going to be distant thirds in a lot of places.HANNITY: So in other words, you think Trump wins New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland?MANAFORT: I think we're doing very well in all those places. All the polls show us leading, and we're just starting to put our campaigns together.HANNITY: It seems like the Cruz campaign is spending a lot of time, energy, focus in districts in California, especially Los Angeles, outside if Los Angeles County. Kasich seems to be targeting the more northern part of the state, San Francisco, et cetera. Is it going to come down to June 7th?MANAFORT: Well, June 7th is something that's going to put us over, but we're not going to have to win overwhelmingly on June 7th. We're going to have...HANNITY: You really...MANAFORT: I think -- I think...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Walk me through your math, then.MANAFORT: Well, we're going to have a ground game in California where we're going to be focusing on the congressional districts, as well. We announced our state chairman today. We've been putting people on the ground. California is going to be a battleground.HANNITY: So you think you can get to 1,237 even before June 7th.MANAFORT: No, I think we need June 7th. But I think -- I think before June 7th, it's going to be apparent that Donald Trump...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Donald Regan? Is that what you were going to say?(LAUGHTER)MANAFORT: There's a lot of similarity to 1980 race with Reagan and Trump.  And a lot of the criticisms of Reagan in 1980 are the same ones being...HANNITY: OK, last question. Walk me through your math.MANAFORT: I'm not going to walk you through the math.HANNITY: You don't want to walk me through the math?MANAFORT: I'm not going to do that yet.HANNITY: Oh.MANAFORT: But I'm going to...HANNITY: The people want to hear you.MANAFORT: Well, just keep watching because it's going to become very apparent. April is going to be a very bad month for Ted Cruz. I mean, he'll probably finish third in delegates in April, compared to...HANNITY: By the end of April, what do you think you'll be at?MANAFORT: We'll be on our way.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: You sound almost like a politician, but -- anyway, Paul, congratulations on your position. We appreciate you being on the program.  We're going to be with Trump tomorrow for the hour. We had Kasich Monday.  We have Cruz on Friday.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: ... tomorrow.MANAFORT: No, he's just finishing up a rally with 25,000 people, I think.HANNITY: A lot of people.MANAFORT: Yes.HANNITY: All right, and coming up next tonight, right here on ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D), NEW YORK CITY: Sorry, Hillary. I was running on CP time.(LAUGHTER)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's not -- I don't -- I don't like jokes like that (INAUDIBLE)(LAUGHTER)CLINTON:  Cautious politician time.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, Hillary Clinton and Comrade de Blasio, the mayor of New York, taking heat for that racially charged, quote, ""joke."" Did they cross a line? What if a Republican said it? Laura Ingraham is here to weigh in on the battle for New York.That and more on this busy news night tonight right here on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" So the New York primary is only a week away from tonight, and the fight for each and every delegate -- that's heating up. Joining us now to weigh in on the state of the race, editor- in-chief of Lifezette.com, nationally syndicated radio host, and of course, Fox News contributor Laura Ingraham. How are you?LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hey, Sean. Good to see you.HANNITY: All right, I don't think I've seen such intense passion, especially on social media between Cruz supporters versus Trump supporters.  This whole issue in Colorado has brought it to a new level, if you will.  What's your take on it?INGRAHAM: I think that folks have to calm down, and I think they have to...HANNITY: Have to breathe in through the nose, out through the mouth?INGRAHAM: Yes. Exactly. (INAUDIBLE) just do some Zen exercises. Calm down.HANNITY: Yes.INGRAHAM: And start thinking about, Sean, why are we here? What do we want to accomplish? Do we want to ensure that we preserve a semblance of constitutionality on our Supreme Court? Do we want to try to get this debt under control so we don't leave it to the kids to have to handle?If we have a series of goals that I think most of us agree on, what is the best way to reach those goals? Surely, we know the best way to get to that place, which means we cannot allow Hillary to be president of the United States, is that the party has to come together and it can't be ripping each other's throats apart, you know, tearing at each other's jugulars morning, noon and night for this purity test that we want to hold ourselves up to that, Oh, I'm the constitutional purist. I'm the conservative purist.  You're not.I mean, when people are starting to question the conservative bona fides of you, me, Phyllis Schlafly, Pat Buchanan, Mike Huckabee and Jeff Sessions, then the world has turned upside down.OK, like, I don't -- I don't really -- I don't take well to people's questioning of my dedication to conservatism over the past -- you know, really since I've been in college getting sued by liberal professors.And I kind of let it roll off my back and I know Sessions and everybody else does, too. You have a thick skin. But we don't sit there stomping our feet, saying, Never, never Cruz or never Rubio. No. We say, Look, let's get through this process. And let's unite behind whoever is really close to getting to 1,237.HANNITY: I actually do...INGRAHAM: That's my view.HANNITY: I say never Hillary.INGRAHAM: Yes!HANNITY: That's my hashtag.INGRAHAM: That's a hashtag.HANNITY: I've even gotten of Twitter because Dana Perino erased my Twitter app on my phone because she thinks I've been too mean to people. That's a whole different story.But let's go to this whole idea of a contested convention. It seems like now that's where everyone's focus is. And certainly, there's a coordinated effort to stop Trump all within the rules, all fair play.INGRAHAM: Yes.HANNITY: Trump's got to win the delegates. But let's assume we get to the convention. He's winning, millions of more votes, states, delegates. And then he doesn't get the nomination. Does that then intensify this divide, or does somehow, everyone -- you know, does, you know, ""Can't we all get along"" win the day? I don't see that happening.INGRAHAM: I think it depends on how this all goes over the next, you know, four weeks. If it seems pretty fair, then I think people will come together. If people feel like this is a bunch of arm-twisting done behind closed doors, where, you know, Trump delegates are kind of, you know, conveniently left out of the equation and where it's a bunch of horse trading of the type we saw with, you know, the -- all the Cornhusker kickback days and all that, then I don't think it's going to go well.If at the end of this people feel like it was rough and they were rough with each other, it was a tough primary, but they fought it out and they gave it the good college try, and then if Ted gets it or Trump gets it, then we can come together. But I think when you have these never-Trump people out there saying I just will never do it, you know, all these histrionics, commentary that is really denigrating to Trump voters, I think those Trump voters have been mistreated for a long time in our political system. They're not going to much like it if Republicans are treating them badly at the end.HANNITY: I wrote you one night on an election night. I don't remember what point in the process, but you were the only one that was -- that said something that I had felt, which was this is the year of the insurgent.  The establishment lost. This seems to now have gotten lost on people, right?INGRAHAM: Well, I think when you have billionaires funding the super PAC that are designed to do one thing, turn away the votes of millions and millions of people across the country, it makes people wonder. These are the -- these are the very billionaires who profited off of absolutely obscene globalization that de-industrialized placed like upstate New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, Columbus, Ohio. They profited off of all this. That's fine, I guess. I mean, they like this stuff. Open borders don't affect their lives. They don't send their kids to public schools.But it affected the rest of America, and that's why Trump and Cruz are pretty much the last men standing. I don't mean to be mean to Kasich.  Look, Trump is up at 55 percent in New York. He's up by 20 points plus in Pennsylvania. He's up in Maryland significantly, as you pointed out.  California will be a very diverse state, different state, but I think he and Cruz, they've got to kind of come to terms with where we are. And I don't like -- I really don't like the ""Lying Ted"" stuff. I wouldn't say that. And I don't like the Kim Kardashian comments by Cruz. I don't like any of those things.I think it's time to focus on the issues. Hillary is a disaster. May the best man win, and try to really appeal to those people who have been left out of politics. They feel left out and denigrated. But I don't like it when these people say never a Republican. I think that's destructive the party, and really it hurts, I think, the people who have been hurt enough by bad policies.HANNITY: You know, I read in a famous book one time blessed are the peacemakers. You get that award tonight. Laura Ingraham, thank you.INGRAHAM: Thanks.HANNITY: And coming up next tonight here next on ""Hannity"" --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DE BLASIO: Sorry, Hillary. I was running on CP time.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's not -- I don't like jokes like that, Bill.  That's not --CLINTON: Cautious politician time.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, racist joke, so why does Hillary Clinton get a pass and New York City mayor comrade Bill de Blasio get a pass? We'll debate that next.Then later, the CIA director says his agency will never bring back enhanced interrogation techniques. Really? What if we know somebody has a suitcase bomb in an American city? We'll check in with Dr. Sebastian Gorka, Bo Dietl. They'll weight in as we continue tonight on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" Hillary Clinton and New York City comrade Bill de Blasio in hot water for a racially charged joke they made this weekend at an event normally features satirical skits. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Thanks for the endorsement, Bill. Took you long enough.(APPLAUSE)DE BLASIO: Sorry, Hillary. I was running on CP time.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's not -- I don't like jokes like that, Bill.  That's not funny.(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: Cautious politician time. I've been there.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right. Was that an over the line? What if Donald Trump or Ted Cruz said it? Here with reaction, trail attorney, political commentator Eric Guster, Fox News senior correspondent Geraldo Rivera, and the author of a brand new book just out today ""Feisty and Feminine, A Rallying Cry for Conservative Women,"" our friend Penny Nance is back. By the way, the book is awesome. I've been reading through it.  Congratulations. You're a great writer and a friend. Welcome to the program. Let me start with you. Geraldo and Eric are making fun of me because I said I never knew what ""CP"" meant before.PENNY NANCE, ""FEISTY AND FEMININE"" AUTHOR: And --Geraldo, I go out with you for crying out loud, and Eric. Give me a break.NANCE: And I heard him say because you don't hang out with enough black people.HANNITY: Eric said that.NANCE: I do have black friends and I actually have not heard that either.  Look, the one group of women -- her, Hillary's unfavorable with women overall around the nation 58 percent. One group she does really well with is African-American women. So you would think she would have been a little more careful and thoughtful about this.HANNITY: Geraldo, if Donald Trump said that, wouldn't they call him a racist? If Ted Cruz said that, wouldn't they have called him a racist? I can't stand the double standard.GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Before I answer that question, I think you may be on to something, and Penny is absolutely right when she suggests that Hillary is disproportionally dependent on the African-American vote, and if anywhere she should tread lightly with the community because that really has been the backbone of her support over --HANNITY: That's her base.RIVERA: -- over Bernie Sanders.In terms of reaction to a Republican uttering the same thing, it would have been catastrophic or cataclysmic. I definitely believe it.HANNITY: Here's the thing. I can't stand the double standard. I would be lying if I sat here and now that I know it's a vernacular used by so many people because you two were making fun of me for 10 minutes. I get it. I don't have the problem. But the double standard, Eric. And if this was Trump, Cruz, this would be the end of their campaign and the outrage and the indignation would be phony.ERIC GUSTER, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: It would not be the end of the campaign.It would.GUSTER: Trump has ignited racial flames all over the country. He has supported people who have attacked black protesters. He's offered to pay legal fees for people who have attacked --HANNITY: You are a broken record. You say this every time you're on.GUSTER: Because it's the truth.HANNITY: It's not racist. Nothing he said is racist.GUSTER: I'm not talking about -- I said he's fanning racial flames.HANNITY: OK, that's calling him a racist and that's total BS. Geraldo doesn't agree with you.GUSTER: His language and his rhetoric fans racial divide in our country, and he is actually supporting it.HANNITY: You know what? And then you give Hillary and comrade de Blasio a pass.GUSTER: Hillary should have made a better decision on that.HANNITY: Oh, she should have made a better decision, and Trump is outrageous.NANCE: It would have been a Todd Akin moment if a Republican had said that, absolutely.But, Sean, let me just say one of the reasons I wrote the book because there's this big issues that we've been talking about tonight, national security.HANNITY: You have any issues with Trump?NANCE: I have a lot of issues with some of the things that he said, yes.  I think because --HANNITY: As a candidate you will vote for him?NANCE: Over Hillary, any day, any day. And by the way, he has a 68 percent unfavorable rating with women, 10 points higher than Hillary.HANNITY: Hillary is not doing hot either.NANCE: And he doesn't even carry married women, which is a sweet spot for Republicans.But let me just say, this is a year for a Republican and particularly conservative women of faith to get their bearings, learn the issues, and lean in. This is an important moment.RIVERA: I think that what is very important right now, you bear me out on this -- the nation has not in 20 years been this divided racially. I think it's the great failing of President Obama he hasn't done more to heal the racial divide. I think to make race jokes at this stage of the game is pretty ill-advised. It is lamentable, because back in my day you could make jokes, you could be crossover and say this about that and the other one. You can't anymore, and I think it is lamentable. But I think a politician --HANNITY: No, no. Liberals can, Geraldo.RIVERA: I don't think it's true.HANNITY: Hillary got away with it.GUSTER: Liberals aren't telling people to go beat people in the face, Sean.HANNITY: Are you going to repeat that line every time you're on?GUSTER: Let me finish. I will take Hillary over those two front-runners any day of the week.HANNITY: You can have her.RIVERA: A Republican will take her candidate, the Democrat will take his candidate, and I'm the swing vote.HANNITY: There you go. Where are you going?""Feisty and Feminine"" in bookstores everywhere. Coming up, Donald Trump fires back at CIA Director John Brennan for criticizing his proposal for enhanced interrogation techniques against terrorists. Bo Dietl, Sebastian Gorka, weigh in next straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" CIA Director John Brennan is making headlines after an interview with NBC News where he said that he would never bring back the use of enhanced interrogation techniques. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN BRENNAN, CIA DIRECTOR: We've learned lessons from the past. We have a lot of capabilities and competencies and skills, and so I don't believe that we need to resort to certain types of tactics.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Like waterboarding?BRENNAN: Absolutely I would not agree to having any CIA officer carrying out waterboarding again.This organization will do what it can to protect the American public from the attacks of terrorists groups. I will not agree to carry out some of these tactics and techniques that I have heard bandied about because this institution needs to endure.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Now Donald Trump, he fired back at those comments, and here's what he said yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I think his comments are ridiculous. I mean, they chop off heads and they drown people in cages with 50 in a cage with in big, steel, heavy cages, drop them right into the water, drown people. And we can't water board and we can't do anything, and, you know, we're playing on different fields. And we have a huge problem with ISIS which we can't beat, and the reason we can't beat them is we won't use strong tactics whether it's this or other things.Can you imagine these ISIS people sitting around eating and talking about this country won't allow waterboarding and they just chopped off 50 heads.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Here with reaction, former NYPD detective Bo Dietl, author of the brand new book ""Defeating Jihad, The Winnable War,"" the distinguished chair of military theory at Marine Corps University Dr. Sebastian Gorka. By the way, I love the book. It's awesome. You're a great military mind. We can defeat ISIS but don't we first have to recognize they exist?DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA, ""DEFEATING JIHAD"" AUTHOR: Totally. We have to talk about them honestly, get politics out of the threat assessment, jettison all this garbage about how it's unemployment and lack of education that makes people behead other human beings and talk about the fact that these people are evil.HANNITY: Remember the jobs program for terrorists?GORKA: Also Jihadis.HANNITY: Yes.But enhanced interrogation, specifically, we didn't get bin Laden without them. I interviewed Jose Rodriguez on this show. You wouldn't have found the courier which led us to bin Laden without Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, KSM, giving that information after being water boarded.GORKA: We have to be factual here. Only three people underwent the enhanced interrogation techniques. In this case it was crucial. I am a little bit skittish about making it a policy across the United States. If there's a ticking time bomb, if there's something, if it's the number one HVT, the number one high-value target, I can understand it. But to say we just do it willy-nilly, that is another issue.HANNITY: We've never done it willy-nilly.GORKA: No. No.HANNITY: Bo, with all your ears, let's say you get called, you're a detective, you get called on a job, kidnapping. Three people enter somebody's house, a home invasion. Two of them get away with two children.  The father or mother tackles the one other guy. He knows where they're taking those kids. How soon do you have to act to get those kids back?BO DIETL, FORMER NYPD DETECTIVE: You've got to act immediately. I always use this thing, if I'm the president and Brennan is the head of my CIA and he makes a statement like that, I'd say, Mr. Brennan, you don't have a job anymore.My point is we should not be advertising what our CIA does. That's one.  We can't blow up our mouths all the time when we do these things. It can be used in certain situations.HANNITY: You mentioned the word ""evil."" This is evil in our time. But there seems to be a mysterious reluctance and resistance from acknowledging that simple truth.GORKA: Absolutely. If you don't believe in objective truth, if you are a champion of multiculturalism, then you're not going to say that such a thing as evil. Remember, this is the administration that thinks you can negotiate with the mullahs in Iran.HANNITY: I'm surprised they didn't live up to their --GORKA: I'm not surprised.DIETL: I've been to Saudi Arabia two dozen times from the late 70s through the 80s. I just learned the guy that I broke my leg with parachuting, he was a brigadier general in the Saudi army. He was just killed within the last year on the border of Yemen and Saudi Arabia. There are a lot of Saudi Arabian military people that are fighting Al Qaeda, are fighting these Muslim terrorists right now. We have an ally in Saudi Arabia. There is another faction in Saudi Arabia. And I can't pronounce.GORKA: Wahhabis.DIETL: Yes. That's over there. And we go back to 1979 when they took over Mecca, remember that?HANNITY: Release the 28 pages that have been redacted from public view as it relates to 9/11 and you'll learn all about Wahhabism and the Saudis involvement, correct?GORKA: That's where it all begins. Saudi Arabia, the siege of Mecca.DIETL: I was there. And you know what we need? What we need is we need cooperation from the Muslim people to help fight these --HANNITY: You would hope so, but unfortunately that has not been as forthcoming as we'd like.I love the book, ""Defeating Jihad, The Winnable War,"" appreciate it. Bo, good to see you.Coming up next, we need your help, right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: All right, time for our ""Question of the Day.""

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, Donald Trump and yours truly, an exclusive right here.Good evening and welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly.  Tonight, an in-depth look as the most unpredictable presidential campaign in U.S. history. As we bring you the rest of our interview with Donald Trump. He made up the rules as he went along. Against all odds he is the last man standing. He took down 17 rivals and even went off certain members of the press, some of whom you know very well. How did he get here and how far can he go?We put those questions to fur of the most accomplished men in politics today. Men who have their finger on the pulse of presidential politics and have for the last 40 years. We showed them the key parts of our sit-down with Trump and tonight we'll show you that as well, including new footage and get reaction from our panel. But first, a look at Trump's rise, including the reasons his sit-down with yours truly got so much attention.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)KELLY: America has never seen anything like the political juggernaut called Donald Trump. A businessman and reality TV star with no political experience bursts on to the scene and electrifies voters with big threats - -  DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We're going to knock the hell out of ISIS.  KELLY: And big promises.  TRUMP: We are going to win in every aspect of our lives.  KELLY: While explaining the art of the deal --TRUMP: We're going to make great trade deals --KELLY: He perfected the art of the insults.  TRUMP: It's Rubio!KELLY: Against rivals --  TRUMP: Little Marco. Little Marco. Lying Ted. Lying Ted.  KELLY: Detractors.  TRUMP: He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured.  KELLY: And the press.  TRUMP: I would never kill them but I do hate them.  KELLY: Including yours truly beginning with the very first Republican debate.Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is you speak your mind and you don't use a politician's filter. You've called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals. Your Twitter account --TRUMP: Only Rosie O'Donnell.  KELLY: Mr. Trump did not like the question. At all. For the record, it was well beyond Rosie O'Donnell.  TRUMP: Yes, I'm sure it was.  KELLY: Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president --TRUMP: What I say is what I say. Honestly Megyn if you don't like it, I'm sorry. I've been very nice to you although I could be maybe not be based on the way you've treated me but I would not do that.KELLY: And he sent out a tweet that night.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wow! @MegynKelly really bombed tonight.  KELLY: And a re-tweet.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fox News gives low mark to bimbo Megyn Kelly.KELLY: Then he made this remark.  TRUMP: She gets out and she starts asking me all sorts of ridiculous questions and you know you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.  KELLY: And he explained it this way.TRUMP: I was going to say nose and or ears. Because that's a very common statement. Blood flowing out of somebody's nose. It's a statement showing anger.  KELLY: That set off a firestorm.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is a candidate who's had a history of some misogynistic statements.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We've seen Donald Trump do this over and over again.KELLY: The pundits said his attacks were political suicide.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: More fallout from the latest Republican debate. I don't know how he thinks he's going to win an election.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This unfavorability with women is --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This weekend surely signals the end of Trump's campaign.  KELLY: The pundits were wrong.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: NBC News/Survey Monkey poll shows Trump with 23 percent.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A new poll number show that Donald Trump is surging.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The more Trump speaks, the more he spikes.  KELLY: It didn't matter what he said or how he said it.  TRUMP: Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. When Mexico sends it people, they're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, their rapists.  KELLY: Voters were angry and they liked that he was angry too. In January he skipped the next FOX News debate.  TRUMP: Megyn Kelly is really biased against me. Do you really think she can be fair at a debate?  KELLY: Which set-off a new torrent of tweets.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Eighty thousand tweets directed towards Megyn Kelly.  Broke it down to see what the most popular words.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Crazy Megyn Kelly.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Crazy, overrated.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bimbo.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bimbo Megyn Kelly.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hooker.  KELLY: Days later he lost the Iowa caucuses. But Trump went on to win and win some more.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Another big win for Donald Trump.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A huge win for Donald Trump.KELLY: And then a new debate.  TRUMP: Nice to be with you Megyn.  KELLY: Great to have you here.  TRUMP: You're looking well. You're looking well.  KELLY: As you.  Followed by more fallout. And a call to boycott ""The Kelly File.""  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can't watch crazy Megyn anymore.KELLY: Finally in April, a meeting at Trump Tower. The meeting was at my request and Mr. Trump was gracious enough to agree to it.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Donald Trump and his arch nemesis Megyn Kelly are making peace.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The sign of a truth this morning between Trump --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Their feud apparently diffused.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You met with Megyn Kelly today. How did that go?KELLY: Seventeen candidates down and Trump is the last man standing. The presumptive Republican nominee.Have you made any mistakes in this campaign? You had said publicly, you thought the re-tweet about Heidi Cruz was a mistake.  TRUMP: Well, I said, I could have done without it to be exact. I could have done without it.KELLY: You said a mistake. Are you walking that back?TRUMP: No, no. I'm not walking it back but I actually didn't say it that way I said. I could have done without it. I mean --KELLY: You shouldn't have done that, right?TRUMP: I wish I didn't do it. Although, you know, I guess you could say she's fair game because she's very much involved with the campaign.KELLY: But that tweet was about her looks.TRUMP: You know what, I have millions of followers @realDonaldTrump. I have millions of followers. I have millions of Facebook --KELLY: I'm familiar.TRUMP: Yes. You are. The thing that gets me in trouble is re-tweets.  The re-tweeters is really more of a killer than the tweets.  The tweets I seem to do pretty well with. KELLY: So that is one, the Heidi Cruz thing, let me just give you a list of a couple -- TRUMP: Sure. KELLY: -- and tell me if you have any regrets on it. The comment about John McCain, you prefer people who were not captured. The comment about Carly Fiorina's face. But do you regret any of those comments? TRUMP: Yes, I guess so, but you have to go forward. You make a mistake and you have to go forward. And, you know, you can correct a mistake, but to look back and say, ""Gee whiz I wish I didn't this or that,"" I don't think that is good, and I don't think in a certain way that is healthy.KELLY: Uh-hm. And one of your advisers recently told Republican Party leaders down in Florida that you have been playing a part and that we're going to see a different Donald Trump. So, which is the real you? You know, the sort of brash tell it like it is guy we've seen on the campaign trail or the more humble possibly boring presidential you?TRUMP: I think it's both, I'll be honest. But, I mean, I change for different settings. If I'm in a boardroom, I'm not going to be shouting and ranting and raving, and doing it the same that way, you know, I would do if I'm speaking to 12 people than if I'm speaking to 25,000 people in a major arena some place. So, I think actually, I'm, you know, I'm probably two or three different personalities.  KELLY: Let me ask you about that. Because most American parents try to raise their kids to not bully, to not name call, to not tease, not taunt.  How can they effectively bring that message when the front-runner for the Republican nomination does all of those things?  TRUMP: Well, I do it, really -- you know, I've been saying during this whole campaign, that I'm a counter-puncher. You understand that. I'm responding. Now, I then respond times, maybe, 10. I don't know. I mean, I respond pretty strongly. But in just about all cases, I've been responding to what they did to me. So it's not a one-way street.KELLY: Let's talk about us.  TRUMP: Okay.KELLY: We were always friendly.  TRUMP: Right. Good relationship.  KELLY: Right? And then came the August 6,2015 debate and I asked you a tough question about women using only the words that you had used. I thought it was a fair question. Why didn't you?TRUMP: I thought it was unfair. First of all, I didn't think it was really a question. I thought it was more of a statement.  KELLY: Afterwards you said that you didn't feel that the moderators had been nice. But do you think it's the journalist's role to be nice to presidential candidates at a debate?TRUMP: Fair. I don't care if they're nice.  KELLY: You used the word nice.  TRUMP: Well, okay, no, I don't think so. I mean, I might have said they weren't nice but that doesn't mean they have to be nice.  KELLY: You know, it's not a cocktail party.  TRUMP: I mean, in a certain way what you did might have been a favor.  Because I felt so good about having gotten through -- I said if I can get through this debate with those questions, you can get through anything.  KELLY: You're no longer just Donald Trump, businessman or Donald Trump host of ""Celebrity Apprentice."" Now you're steps away from the presidency.  Have you given any thought in this position to the power that your messaging has on the lives of the people you target and on the millions of people who take their cue from you?TRUMP: I have. I have. And I see suffering. I mean I see tremendous suffering. And I understand. I have a very big heart. A lot of people don't understand that. But people that know me do. And we have to take care of our country. And I do feel America first. I mean, America has been fourth and fifth and ninth.  KELLY: But you know what I'm saying.TRUMP: I do.KELLY: When Donald Trump targets somebody and says, this person is bad, that person is bad, it creates a firestorm in those people's lives. And many of these people are so-called civilians who haven't put themselves out there as public figures.  TRUMP: But it's in response to something that they did.  KELLY: But they're listening to you. And they're taking their cue from you. So that's the question, is whether now so close to the Oval Office, whether you will take that responsibility seriously and change your tone to try to be more unifying and less divisive.  TRUMP: I do take it very seriously. And I understand what's going on.  And when I see 25,000 people that have seats and not one person during an hour speech will sit down. I say sit down, everybody, sit down. And they won't sit down. They refuse to sit down. I mean, that's a great compliment. But I do understand the power of the message. There's no question about it.  KELLY: I want to talk for a minute about the tweeting. You'll pick up your iPhone and tweet yourself?TRUMP: Yes. Usually about 7:00 or 8:00 at night I'll do it myself. But during the day when I'm in the office, I have a number of people that I just call out a tweet to. It's always my right. When you and I were having a little difficulty, you probably had some pretty nasty tweets sent your way out. I don't want to say but I've heard that. I don't want that to happen. But fans, they really love -- we have an unbelievable bond. We have an unbelievable --  KELLY: You re-tweet some of those, not just the fans.  TRUMP: Yes. But not the more nasty ones. You would be amazed at the ones don't re-tweet.KELLY: Bimbo?TRUMP: Well, that was a re-tweet. Yes. Did I say that?KELLY: Many times.  TRUMP: Oh! Okay. Excuse me.  KELLY: What do you think of, I mean --TRUMP: Not the most horrible thing. You know, again politically but not the most -- over your life Megyn, you've been called a lot worse, is that right? Wouldn't you say? You know, you've had a life that's not been that easy and --  KELLY: It's not about me. It's not about me. It's the messaging to young girls and to women.  TRUMP: It's a certain amount of fighting back. You know, it's a modern day form of fighting back.KELLY: So let's talk about what we just saw with Trump and basically the theme of that interview was temperament and his anger, his ability to control himself. He calls it counter punching. You know in my push to him was, you know, query whether that's true when you're talking about members of the media or so-called civilians who just have a disagreement with you.  Which will happen as president. Something will come after you. Somebody will disagree with you. Ed, your thoughts.ED ROLLINS, FOUNDER OF GREAT AMERICAN PAC SUPPORTING TRUMP: This was a very good piece for him. This was very deliberate. He was very calm.  Reassuring. None of the anger or the angst was there. And I was saying after seeing it that, you know, this is the kind of -- this is the temperament you want to show the public. We haven't seen that up to this point.  KELLY: Intentional? Was that intentional on his part?ROLLINS: Sure. Sure. I mean, obviously his wife and daughter and everybody else told him, be cool in this interview. It's a very important interview and you've got to do it well.  KELLY: Uh-hm. Mark?MARK MCKINNON, CHIEF MEDIA STRATEGIST, BUSH CAMPAIGN 2000/2004: Well, I definitely saw some evolution there. You know, there's always those competing factions particularly with Trump when you have advisers and friends saying, you got here by letting Trump be Trump. So, don't change a thing. But in order to be president you've got to change a lot. George W. Bush did, Ronald Reagan did. I mean, the stress and the pressure of the White House, I mean, you can't just be a counter puncher all of the time in the White House. There's a lot of times we have to wait, rope a dope and you got to be get a lot of votes --KELLY: Or you can't punch it off.  MCKINNON: You're right.  KELLY: Annoying members in the media who say things about you that may or may not be true. But you can't come after them for a year in every case.  MCKINNON: That's right. But I think a lot of people will have seen that interview and will be somewhat reassured that there was a less combative Donald Trump there, and you know, a step more presidential.  KELLY: Uh-hm. What do you think Stuart?  STUART STEVENS, CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST, ROMNEY CAMPAIGN 2012: The highlight to me was an extraordinary moment where he did apologize. I mean, here he said these things about you, about others. He should have -- 99 out of 100 people would have said, look, this spun out of control. I didn't want it to be like this. You set it up by saying this is your first question. You know? And he could have said, you know, I really want but I've learned from this. Which is another thing you didn't hear. I've learned from this and I'm sorry, this shouldn't have happened. And he will never do that.  And I think it's a -- it's very problematic as a candidate and I think he's even more problematic as a president. Because one thing about presidents is, they all make mistakes and it's your ability to admit it's a mistake and learn from it that often stops you from making a greater mistake.  KELLY: He wouldn't even admit that the Heidi Cruz re-tweet was a mistake.  STEVENS: I know. You know, ultimately, you know, this president has to be very humbling.  MCKINNON: It does. And one of George W. Bush's great mistakes is when asked about his regrets couldn't name one at a particular juncture in his presidency. And people want to hear that. They want to hear that you're a human, you make mistakes, you're vulnerable. I mean, that's authenticity.  KELLY: Uh-hm.MCKINNON: And that's what voters are hunger for.KELLY: I think it shows leadership.  ROLLINS: A weakness.KELLY: Right.ROLLINS: Mea culpa is never going to come out of this man's mouth. Just never is.KELLY: So, is that disconcerting do you think to voters or do you think Republican voters are like, yes --ROLLINS: Not to his voters. His voters applaud his strength. And one of the great thing is he's the decision maker. He can go in there and straighten this mess out in Washington and everybody else is a wimp. Well, I'm not a wimp.MCKINNON: Yes. And, you know, we looked at this very closely in presidential elections and the interesting thing is that voters don't really vote on issues in presidential elections, they vote on attributes.  And the most important attributes are strength, trust and values. And you know, when we were running against Al Gore, were losing on every issue but we're beating him by 20 points on the perception of strength. So, that's really important. And that's where a lot of the support for Donald Trump is coming from.  KELLY: So, do you think that Democrats or Left leaning Independents are going to feel the same?MO ELLEITHEE, TRAVELLING PRESS SECRETARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN 2008: Look, I think it's -- we now know he knows how to turn the volume down. That's what that interview showed. He can turn the volume down. But the same concerns that Democrats and left leaning Independents have had from the very beginning were only amplified I thought in this. He doesn't know how to apologize. He doesn't know how to be less divisive. He doesn't know how to unite people and bring people together. Every time you gave him an opportunity to do so, he actually pushed away. He doesn't know how to tell the truth. And those aren't things that are going to help him moving forward with those people who weren't already with him.  KELLY: Let's talk about the telling the truth issue. Do you believe he was sincere when he suggested he didn't know whether he had re-tweeted the bimbo tweets?ELLEITHEE: No. No. For guy who --  KELLY: Do any of you believe that he didn't remember that in.  STEVENS: Of course not.  KELLY: Do you guys believe that?ROLLINS: I think he has an amazing ability to rationalize. And I think it's part of his persona. I mean, he gets up and what I say today doesn't matter tomorrow. I just keep moving forward.KELLY: Go ahead, Mo.ELLEITHEE: I think that's exactly right. For a guy who claims to follow the media as closely as he does and I believe he probably does, for him to not remember or even read the coverage about all of the times he's done it.  It's laughable.  MCKINNON: Or rationalizes that it was a re-tweet to somebody else.  KELLY: But it happens at least four times. And, you know, I wasn't going to get into this in the interview because I didn't want to make it about me. I didn't even want to raise them both. But there was so many. I mean, there was crazy, there was sick, there was boycott, there was liar.  I mean it went on and on and on. I could have gone down the list. I just didn't want to make it that kind of exchange. Because I've tried to take myself out of this rather than put myself in it. I was trying to get that temperament and accountability for things he, you know, has been mocked for, has been skewed for.  STEVENS: I think Americans, something actually Ed said to me years ago, but Americans are very forgiving. But I think that you have to acknowledge that you want forgiveness for mistakes. You have to go through this process. And that's, I think, the stumbling block that he's going to have, he has 30 percent or less favorables now. To build to somewhere closer to 50, he needs to win an election. You're going to have to try to present a different person to a group of people who are not new to you. They've seen you a lot, they've seen these patterns. And you're going to have to be able to say look, this was a mistake, I can change. But you have to go through this. I mean, it's like --MCKINNON: He took a step in that direction. He said there were some things he would have done differently. He wasn't specific about it.(CROSSTALK)What's your sense of the man who responded to you at the debate, the man you had the meeting with and then the man you did the interview with?KELLY: Well, I would say, you know?MCKINNON: Is it the same guy?KELLY: Yes, I would say all three of those guys are the same guy. Even on the debate stage, there was a veiled threat, you know that I've been very nice to you maybe I wouldn't be, maybe I won't be. But I wouldn't do that.  Then of course he did. But he wasn't nasty, he wasn't openly nasty on the debate stage. And certainly in our meeting he was kind and I thought in this setting we were very amiable. I mean, we got along very well. But the truth is behind closed doors and when he's angry, Trump is legitimately angry. I mean, I don't know about his anger management skills. It's not fake. He gets really angry. And he holds a grudge. And I don't -- you tell me whether that is a problem in a president or --ROLLINS: Yes.(LAUGHTER)ROLLINS: -- in the Oval Office, having worked for three different presidents and having spent a substantial period of my time, nobody goes in and argues with the President. They present things to him. They basically let him make the decision. So, I can promise you, what you want to have is a reality check. You want someone on your staff who will come in and tell you the truth but usually that person pays a price. And it's why most members of Congress have a tough time dealing with the President because they're not peers and they're not equal.  KELLY: So, is this to Trump's benefit then because he would say, I'm a businessman, I'm a leader, I make decisions every day?ROLLINS: When I see the strength of him, I don't doubt that he's going to make tough decisions. I think, I mean, I've studied presidents, I teach a course in the presidents, I've been around a number of presidents. I don't have any doubt that he basically -- I worry about the temperament. I worry about -- one of the things that I see as the most important quality a president can have is be a secure president. If you're insecure, which we've had many presidents who are insecure, you have all of the resources in the world to try to compensate for that.  (END VIDEOTAPE)KELLY: Up next, our panel has an interesting take on what is driving Trump's run for the White House. And we'll ask the candidate about the people he targets.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)The real question about Trump is whether he wants this. You know, Barack Obama made a joke at the White House Correspondents' Dinner that here is a guy who was looking to improve his real estate holdings and now we're wondering whether Cleveland will survive July, right? And there are -- a lot of people have questions about Trump and whether he really wants this or he's doing this as a vanity project. Thoughts on that?(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)TRUMP: You probably had some pretty nasty tweets sent your way. I don't want to say but I've heard that. I don't want that to happen. But my fans, they really love -- we have an unbelievable bond. We have an unbelievable --KELLY: You re-tweet some of those, not just the fans.TRUMP: Yes. But not the more nasty ones. You would be amazed at the ones I don't re-tweet.  KELLY: Bimbo.  TRUMP: That was a re-tweet. Yes. Did I say that?KELLY: Many times.  TRUMP: Oh! Okay. Excuse me.KELLY: What do you think with, I mean --TRUMP: Not the most horrible thing -- over your life, Megyn you've been called a lot worse.KELLY: Has he effectively neutralized the women issue by raising the way Hillary treated the women who accused Bill of assault or the women who had affairs with Bill. That's where he's going to go, that she assisted him in his alleged abuse of women.  ELLEITHEE: Unlike Donald Trump I'm not going to pretend to speak for women. However I don't think. I mean, what is so jarring about that ad is it's his voice. It's his words. I'm a dad. I got a little girl at home.  If anyone talked about my little girl the way he talks about women --KELLY: Uh-hm.ELLEITHEE: I mean I would lose my cool.  KELLY: You know what they say. Their line, and what they've been saying a lot lately is, he's an equal opportunity offender. That he makes fun of the men too. He used derogatory terms for everyone.  STEVES: Why -- I mean, if you were teaching a class and you had a kid who said that, you would say no, that's not how you act. You treat people with respect. What you want to be is not an equal opportunity offender, you want to be an equal opportunity respecter.  KELLY: Well, I asked him about this. And said, how are American parents supposed to teach their children not to bully, not to name call, not to taunt, when the Republican nominee does all of those things and his answer was, I'm a counterpuncher. These are all counterpunches.STEVENS: That's fine if you're running casinos, that's fine if you're putting together real estate deals in Atlantic City, that's fine if you're out there selling steaks. As a quality of the president of the United States, you have a unique role model really in the world.  ELLEITHEE: He is not a victim. And that's the argument he's making, is that he is a victim who is hitting back. He is not a victim and I don't want a president who walks around thinking they're a victim all the time.  KELLY: Do women vote on -- I know women don't vote necessarily on women's issues. Right? The Democrats play that up in pretty much every election.  And the Republican women seem to say, I'm not defined by my ovaries, I'm going to vote based on my -- national security. But this is a little different, Ed. Isn't it? This is exactly.ROLLINS: Fifty three percent on the country are women. So, you can't say that the women's vote, there's all kinds of segments of it and all kinds of -- and anybody that basically tries to generalize usually fails miserably.  Obviously the margin here, if you get above 10 percent, just going to the number system, if we lose the gender gap on more than 10 percent, you can't put it together.  KELLY: Just between that, still have to do the math, what do you say?ROLLINS: If you're getting 55 percent of the men's vote and you're getting less than 45 percent of the women's vote, the likelihood is you're not going to win.  STEVENS: If I just said right now that Mitt Romney have a gender gap, it would be true. But it's really deceptive. Mitt Romney won white women by 14 points. He won younger voters under 30 by seven points if you were white. So, really, it's not gender or sex that's dividing here. It's ethnicity.  ROLLINS: And it's single women.  STEVENS: We do less well with single women.  KELLY: Married women tend to prefer the Republicans. Single women tend to prefer the Democrats.MCKINNON: Donald Trump has surprised and shocked the political world. But the concept of Donald Trump shouldn't have surprised us. Because I went back in 1992, you ran a guy named Ross Perot. And I look at those fundamentals about the country versus what they are to date. They're like five times worse today than they were back -- there was an opening for an outsider businessman in 1992, there's a giant opening for a guy like Trump.  But I thought it would come through an independent candidacy --  (CROSSTALK)ROLLINS: When we went down to run his campaign, he was at 39 percent in the polls leading both Bill Clinton and Bush. Thirty nine percent -- two months. For two months. And then what happened is he's self-destructed.  And the difference between him and basically Donald Trump, the moment the media started treating him like a presidential candidate, he got in a fetal position, crawl under his bed and wouldn't come out.  MCKINNON: It's like it gives him more power.  ROLLINS: It gives him more power.And the whole idea that he's a counterpuncher -- I was a fighter 50 years ago. I know how to counterpunch. He doesn't just knock you down, he kicks you. He wants that -- that sort of his whole persona now. Is that a good persona? The piece that you did with him, that's the persona I want if I'm involved in this campaign. That's what I want the country to see. And over time that would have erase some of the perception. But you've got to basically ramp up his supporters.  KELLY: But here's the question. There's no question that Trump is a mater, manipulator of the media, nor that he loves to win and real punch anybody who he thinks stands in his way. But the real question about Trump is whether he wants this. You know, Barack Obama made a joke at the White House Correspondents' Dinner that here's a guy who is looking just to improve his real estate holdings and now we're wondering whether Cleveland will survive July, right? And there are a lot of people with questions about Trump on whether he really wants this or he's doing this as a vanity project. Thoughts on that?ROLLINS: Well it's a tough vanity project. Because at the end of the day he either wins and that he gets all of the vanity that he wants or he gets a very bad defeat and that's not good for your vanity. And how important it is that you go through this process. We've all been around candidates sort of loss. It's tedious, tedious process.  (END VIDEOTAPE)KELLY: Up next, for the first time you will see Donald Trump answer our questions about Hillary Clinton and the general election. And our panel has some thoughts on that matchup.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Okay. Let's talk about Hillary Clinton. Most of the polls have her beating you in a head-to-head matchup and you say you haven't started on Hillary Clinton.  TRUMP: I have not started.  KELLY: But she has 99 percent name recognition. And she's been around a long time. So, what could you possibly tell us about her that we don't know?(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)KELLY: Okay. Let's talk about Hillary Clinton. Most of the polls have her beating you in a head-to-head matchup. And you say you haven't even started on Hillary.  TRUMP: I have not started yet.  KELLY: But she has 99 percent name recognition. And she's been around a long time. So, what could you possibly tell us about her that we don't know?TRUMP: Well, look, she has had a very corrupt system going. I mean if you look at her career, whether it's Whitewater or whether it's the e-mails or so many other things. And --KELLY: She's beating you by 30 points in New York right now.  TRUMP: Well, I'm doing very well in New York. You have to understand, no other Republican would even come to New York to campaign. But I think I'm going to win Michigan, I think I'm going to win Pennsylvania. I think we're going to do very well. But don't forget, the process is just now starting.  KELLY: Who is more likely to go to war, you or Hillary Clinton?TRUMP: Well, I think she would be much more likely to go to war. I think that I will be known as a tougher person than her. But I think that people aren't going to mess with me. And I think she would be more likely to be forced perhaps to go to war. I think our country will be much more respected with me as president than with Hillary Clinton as president. And if you look at her votes, I mean, she voted very strongly in favor of the Iraq war, Bernie Sanders has said some horrible things about her for that decision and others, that she doesn't have good judgment. Bernie Sanders said she has --KELLY: You are on record as having supported that in a radio interview.  TRUMP: Support what?KELLY: The war in Iraq.  TRUMP: No, no, just the opposite.  KELLY: You did say that on the radio.  TRUMP: No, no, I was speaking to Howard Stern on his show long before the war went, and he asked me a question because I was thinking about it, and I said I don't know. Maybe, maybe, maybe. That was before the war started.HOWARD STERN, HOST, ""THE HOWARD STERN SHOW"": Are you for invading Iraq?TRUMP: Yes, I guess so. You know, I wish it was -- I wish the first time it was done correctly.And then they have me later on saying shortly thereafter that we shouldn't go in.KELLY: What's going to happen in the general election? They just showed that...(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That question is very important. There were 16 candidates running against him...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, that's another one.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ... and some very significant people.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Much better field.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I thought that since...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Since 1980. If you go back to 1980. A very strong field.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And he basically knocked these guys out left and right.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But that's in part because no one else in the field understood the moment we were in. And you do have to give him credit that he understood the moment that we're in, what the electorate is looking for.He understood that. Even republican primary voters don't want etiology. They want Huckabee.KELLY: That does that not terrify Hillary Clinton?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He can read a room, he could read the country better than anybody.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, but he has a playbook on it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right. Well, there is and there isn't. You mentioned the word populous, right? He was running as a populous candidate. His supporters hate Wall Street as much as -- as much as Bernie Sanders supporters do.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But this is the point I was trying to get to -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look, just to finish the point, what Donald Trump is out there saying is I don't care about etiology, I'm just going to try to level the playing field for you. The rest of the republican field let him run with that. They gave him a wide open field on that, no one challenged him on that point.Marco Rubio tried once, he had a great moment in that debate when he went after Trump saying...KELLY: Lions around the states.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right. And talking about Trump U and how you're out there trying to screw the little guy, not helping the little guy. And Trump started to crumble. That was his worse moment in almost any debate.If that's the democratic attack on him in the fall, I will be very curious to see how he handles it. And it ties these things together. It ties the message and the temperament together.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But my point about the ideology is this. That in 1999, George W. Bush and earlier started articulating a message about compassionate conservatism that attracted conservative democrats and independents like me to become republicans.And he was -- and he was proactive on immigration, proactive on education reform, things that really, you know, got my interest and millions of others to cross the bridge and support George W. Bush.If, you know, whatever Trump's ideology is or vision is going to be formulated in this campaign and at the convention speech. And there are lots of things that are, you know, getting attention like, you know, he's sort of to the left of republicans on trade and not typical...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: And how about him saying that Hillary is more likely to take us to war than he is.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right. That he did so he could be the left of Hillary on trade, left of Hillary on foreign intervention. So he's going to be the head of the Republican Party. That's where the party is going to be about anyway.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let me go back for a while. There's two arguments you can make. You can make the intellectual argument which you've done beautifully. And I could make an intellectual argument about things that I believe in. And there's an emotional argument.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The emotional argument wins both. And what he is he's like the kid playing football or basketball. Give me the ball, coach, I'm going to score. And that's what he's done since the beginning of this campaign.Give me the presidency. I'll fix it. I'm a fixer. I'm a fixer. And there's a whole bunch of people out there saying, we elected a republican Congress, they failed miserably, we elected a republican senator, they failed miserably. We've got Obama he's got to do everything he wants for the last seven or eight years. And that's a lot of the frustration in our side.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, and Trump understands the power of storytelling. And he gets this. You did it amazingly with Reagan. The bear at the woods ad was one of the greatest ads ever done.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's a bear in the woods. For some people the bear is easy to see. Others don't see it at all. Some people say the bear is tame. Others say it's vicious and dangerous. Since no one can really be sure who is right, isn't it smart to be as strong as the bear? If there is a bear.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It establishes a threat and opportunity, a victim, a villain, a resolution and a hero. And that's -- but this time it's not the bear in the woods.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I had to fight -- I had to fight Jim Baker for three months. We got to put the bear in the woods. I'm doing the Russian -- when the Russian made the Olympics.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ... and Baker didn't get it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But just translate that to this election, and it's not bears in the woods, it's immigrants at the border.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely. Right.KELLY: OK. But Trump reverses himself a lot.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.KELLY: So, one of the clips was on Iraq and he wants to claim -- he's going to claim against Hillary that he was against the war and she was for it.But of course I asked him, you know, you were for it. He said that on Howard Stern. And he tried to sort of make it sound like that was long before the Iraq war. And in fact, it was only like two months.And he's already softening on the Muslim policy. So, we don't, you know, we don't really know what we're going to get. He's softened his immigration position as well.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So what's interesting about that is Donald Trump is a different kind of candidate. I think voters are different kind of voters today.And what's happening, I mean, that's a huge surprise to all of us who have done campaign that somebody could evolve and shift their position so much and not pay a consequence. But I think that's partially people are saying, he's not a politician, so.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And by doing that very thing he's not being political by changing his position.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is what you have to remember, 30 percent of the country like him. He's historically high unfavorables.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As Hillary herself.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And Hillary Clinton is a perfect opportunity for the republicans to win because she has historically high. But he is even though running against someone who is historically high, he's managed to come in.Thirty percent of the country thinks Hillary Clinton is trustworthy. Normally you would think, that's unbelievable. It's done.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can't win.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But only 27 percent think that of Donald Trump.KELLY: But when you talk about when we go back to Ed's point about what they really want is a strong leader, he's got her beat on strength. Strength, you know, if that's the number one criteria.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's going to -- what this -- for Donald Trump to win, Donald Trump is going to have to truly grow. And most good candidates do grow. And they learn. They're self-teachers. They ought to that acts. That point...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because they listen to guys like us.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, they do themselves.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.KELLY: I mean, this is obviously the biggest question is, OK, we've analyzed Trump. But the question is how does he do against this opponent and how does she do against him.We heard in the interview he's saying he's maintained all along, he's going to flip states that traditionally go democrat red this go round. New York, which I pointed out she's beating him in 30 points in the last fall we had.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And we've lost it by two million votes from the last two elections.KELLY: Michigan.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.KELLY: Pennsylvania.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's possible.KELLY: He believes he can turn red. You believe that.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Possible.KELLY: Now and her camp is saying, you know what, he is going to turn states different colors. He's going to turn Utah from a reliable red to a blue.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That can't happen.KELLY: Maybe Oregon.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Than can't happen.KELLY: You don't think so.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean, one thing that we do know for sure. Everyone who is Hispanic today is probably going to be Hispanic on election day, and everyone that's African-American and everyone that's white.There seems to be two groups of voters. Men and women. So, if you just look at it. You know, Ronald Reagan in 1980 got 57 percent of the white vote, and won a sweeping landslide in 44 states. Mitt Romney in 2012 got 59 percent of the white vote and won 24 states.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You also had a third candidate you had John Anderson in (Inaudible).UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a different -- I mean, the fact is that...KELLY: You can't win with just whites.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The political mandate for the Republican Party to do better with nonwhite voters.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You can't win -- you can't win with whites if you had all the whites. The problem is you don't get all the whites. I mean, it's just -- there's not enough whites to win an election.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When George W. Bush ran we had a target -- we said in order to win this election we have to get 40 percent of the Hispanic vote. We got 41. Romney got 27?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: twenty seven.KELLY: I heard it's 29.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Either way.KELLY: yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: yes. So, I mean, you have, I think that there's a political imperative that's undeniable that republicans have to do better with nonwhite voters. I think there is also a moral imperative though.Because to govern the country, a country that is changing and that is the essence of our country is always this melting pot, republicans have to do better on this.KELLY: What is it about Hillary that makes you say that, that she's terrible.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: because she's terrible. You don't have to ask me. Ask any democrat.KELLY: But what's -- let's get to specifics. What is it?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She's basically is inconsistent in her message. She has a real integrity issue. He may have too. But she really has an integrity issue. People don't believe her. There's all kinds of crap around the whole Clinton family and it has been for 30 years.And my sense is no one looks at her and says other than the fact that we want to have the first woman president, which many of us do and it's a desirable goal. Many now are saying, but not her. We're tired of her.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you -- if you go back, you know, as the famous memo that the Obama campaign wrote as they entered the primary against Hillary Clinton, New York has published this recently. If you go back and read that it's all still true.I mean, this is someone who is easily moved by situation to evolve into a different complete political position.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.KELLY: That sounds familiar.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at her own trade.KELLY: That's we were just making that criticism about Trump.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And that is the great danger to me of republicans, that if you have two people who are transactional running, as representative of parties, I think that that is a lost opportunity for republicans to say that we stand for these principles.And these are how these principles govern and this is why it's good for you. Now the great problem republicans have had is not being able to translate these principles into convincing enough people that it was good for them on the presidential level.KELLY: What do you tell, I mean, how does Donald Trump get passed this demographics that we were just discussing?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, a very difficult. I mean, you have to bring a different kind of voter out, you have to take voters away from her. Obviously democrats begin with an almost upstage to begin with, to put it away.But I think this is an unpredictable election. I think there's an angry electorate out there and this election is a changing elections. Reagan was a change election.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Ross Perot movement against daddy Bush. If Perot would have been a different kind of candidate he may have caused the present. That was a change election. And I think this may be a change election.We've got two terms of a president that basically most republicans are very intensely don't like and equally as important as a lot of other Americans who don't think he's been a very good president and they don't want a third term.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, and a candid moment Hillary Clinton said that her husband campaign in poetry and she campaigns in probes. But there was an interesting moment that we caught of Bill Clinton that we air on the circus where he says this election is going to come down to who's the best change agent.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, that's the truth.KELLY: Wow. That's not good for her. Because think about it. If they want change and the voters in the republican primary have said time and time again they want that more than they want electability in their candidate.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's right.KELLY: Could you think of a worse person to run than Hillary Clinton?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let me just describe two things. I was trying to describe with words. If I say to you at this table Donald Trump is a decision maker, he's been a decision maker all of his life, he's a tough guy who survived the toughest industry in New York. And he survived on the top. He may have learned at the knee of his father.Hillary is a staffer. Hillary is someone who could do the good policy but you can see her as the chairman or the chairman of the congressional committee or a staffer in a congressional committee. Can you really see her as the commander-in-chief?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, I think the biggest problem you asked me before what should democrats be worried about, I think the thing I'm most worried about is the unpredictability of this guy.He doesn't play by the same rule book that all of us campaign consultant and hacks have played by all of these years. You know, I studied international relations in college. One of the few things I remember was that international diplomacy, there was a thing called the rational actor theory.Every move you make is based on the notion that your opponent is going to act rationally. It's a chess game. You can game out what they're going to do with every single move that you make.Then you got a country like North Korea, and they don't act rationally and they're unpredictable and you have no idea what the heck they're going to do. He's like the North Korea of American politics.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's real.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No idea what's he's going to do.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Still ahead, our panel weighs on what they call one of the most telling moments in the whole interview while Donald Trump talks strategy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I've gotten, they say if I believe Fox, which I do, they say that I've had $2 billion worth of free air time.KELLY: The free air time comes in some part because of the controversy that you've generated.TRUMP: Perhaps.KELLY: Is that why you did it?(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: I want to bring it back to you.TRUMP: OK. Go ahead?KELLY: You were born a rich man's son.TRUMP: OK.KELLY: And you grew to become even richer. What if you hadn't been born rich. What do you think you would have been?TRUMP: I was in real estate -- I didn't want to do real estate. I wanted to actually make movies. I wanted to actually go and make movies, and I wanted to be a professional baseball player. I wanted to be, you know, lots of different things. But ultimately, I decided that I just did well with real estate. And maybe I put showbiz in real estate.KELLY: What do you think is the difference between being a businessman and being president?TRUMP: Well there is a difference. There's a big difference. You have to really have more heart, in my opinion, as president. The decisions are so much bigger. I mean, when you're going to send somebody into war where you know potentially thousands of people are going to be killed, on both sides, not just our side, on both sides, these are massive decisions. These are unbelievable decisions. And I would say the president needs heart.KELLY: Now, you seem almost unable to let things go when people come after you. You call it counter punching. But as president...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: How can you possibly say that?KELLY: But as president you're going to have to let some things go.TRUMP: No.KELLY: Why should the voters believe you can do it?TRUMP: Well I think I can do it. But at the same time I'm going to be very loyal to the voters. I mean, I will fight hard for the voters like I fight for myself.KELLY: Including when it comes to members of the press?TRUMP: Well, if you get treated dishonestly by the press -- and I'm not referring to you at all. But there are many people that treat me very dishonestly.KELLY: But even if that's true.TRUMP: No, no, but...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Let's say they're corrupt.TRUMP: They're corrupt.KELLY: You know, can't we really just go through seven years of a president that most republican said was way too thin skinned when it came to his media coverage?TRUMP: Well, I can't report on another president. I can only say this. I am -- I have great respect for good writers and not all of the media is dishonest at all. There are some tremendous people in the media.But much of it is. I've gotten -- they say, if I believe Fox, which I do, they say that I've had $2 billion worth of free air time.KELLY: Right.TRUMP: Or whatever they happened to call it. I've had actually an amazing number. I didn't realize it was this bad, 55,000 negative ads have been against me. And despite that, here I am.KELLY: The free air time comes in part because of the controversy that you've generated.TRUMP: Perhaps.KELLY: Is that why you did it?TRUMP: Well, I guess it might be a little bit. I mean, for some reason I get ratings. I don't know what that is. You'll have to explain that to me because I've, you know, never necessarily understood it.KELLY: Did Melania or Ivanka ever tell you to stop with the tweets in all the rest of it?TRUMP: A little bit but at the same time they know that I've taken down many -- I've taken down in respect, Ok. I'm not saying take down. But, you know, I've beaten many people that are very smart. I think Melania would like to see me be a little more presidential. But then after --I don't -- let me say this. I don't think -- if I wanted to act -- and I could act that very easily. That would be so -- that's an act.KELLY: To be presidential?TRUMP: Well, I think it is to a certain extent. I think if I used that demeanor, just the demeanor, I probably wouldn't be talking to you, certainly not to be talking to you about this successful race.KELLY: If you don't become president, will this all have been for nothing? Or will you have changed America?TRUMP: I will say this. If I don't go all the way and if I don't win, I will consider it to be a total and complete waste of time, energy and money.KELLY: During the same interview he wanted to produce movies which is actually so interesting, isn't it? He wanted to be in a limelight and he's found a way to be in the limelight his whole life.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, my sense is he started off with more of just a notion, that it would be an entertaining fun thing to do, kind of the biggest ring, the biggest spotlight in the world, I'll go do this, have some fun and if it doesn't work out I'll go back to doing other things that have made me really successful.But I also think that as this is happening, he was sort of got into like, hey, I can do this.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I can do this.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, I can do this. It's not that big of a deal.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Listen, I'm very old-fashioned about this. I think there is a respect for the presidency that you have to bring to the process. And part of that is just the acquisition of knowledge and learning more about the world and learning what you don't know.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's a coincidence.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's very old-fashioned.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But I think that that is essential in a president. And I think to have someone who doesn't know what the nuclear triad is, a subject taught in the 10th grade ant doesn't seem regretful that he doesn't know, I think is very troubling.KELLY: He can learn.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But there's no indication that he has.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One of the most...(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To say that South Korea, we'll give them nuclear weapons. Whatever. Japan, we'll give them nuclear weapons. This is funny at the dinner table, it's provocative. It's funny if you call a talk radio show, saying this is John, I'm calling you, we ought to give those guys nukes. That's fine. But the level of seriousness, people actually listen to this. And I think that that words have consequences.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But one of the blessings of this country is we have a checks and balances system. There is not one of us have every dealt with the Congress.KELLY: What about when it comes to being commander in chief however?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Commander-in-chief you're going to have some great advisers, probably the best military advisers in the world are on our military. And they will give him the options and they will try to advise him in the correct direction.My sense is that once you see all of those options, the scariest thing in the world is when they hand you that little card and they tell you that you now control the nukes. And I remember President Reagan saying, President saying, well, how much time do I have?I say, well, Soviets have nine Polaris submarines off the coast. And you have about 10 minutes before they blow up the Oval Office. When you go to these tests and what have you, and you see the stuff you learn a lot more about the world. And you can't learn it until you get there in some cases.No matter how much you want to read the books and all of the rest of it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Some people are more sophisticated than others. But until Ronald Reagan went through a nuclear game after he was shot and he saw that the U.S. could be blown up in about five minutes.We had 25,000 missiles aide and 25,000 missiles, we ended up winning the war but the president was killed and basically four minutes, 400 -- 425,000 were fired off and nothing was rubble left in the world. He walked away a changed man.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, let me just make a point. The inability to stop yourself from tweeting, something you shouldn't tweet, is not like a good test that you should have the little card with the nuclear codes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Or the tweeter.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's, you know, when you're asking like, well, is someone going to stop you from tweeting. That's like, I think we better like maybe take the keys away.It's just, listen, there is something that -- we talk about the gravitas of being president. And what does that really mean? It means someone that you can trust to make the hardest worst decisions imaginable that any person on this planet has to make.With the consequences that go far, far beyond you. And that to me is why presidents age, the way they age when you see them, why they're always tired. And I think why very few presidents criticize other presidents.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because they know how difficult it is.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was going say, look, we're all campaign guys. We've all won races, we've all lost races and we all play to win. And you should. But maybe one of the most disappointing things that I took away from the interview is when he said if I lose I will have considered this a tremendous waste of time.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And money.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And that tells me that it is all about him in his mind. It is a vanity project.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's interesting.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you lose -- I hate losing. I've lost races and I hate the feeling. But I don't feel bad for having fought the fight. I don't feel bad for having pushed the agenda. Maybe we didn't win that time but we've moved the ball down the field just a little bit. You've mobilized the new voters.You've gotten people energized and excited and you go back out there the next time. It's not a waste of time. It's democracy. And that really bothered me.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, that goes to why having something that you're fighting for other than winning.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's right.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It becomes important. Because, you know, if you don't stand for anything but election, you don't stand for anything.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's right.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And so, a lot of conservatives, this is very troubling about Donald Trump and I think this probably has been articulated well by Ben Sasses, a senator from Nebraska and by Paul Ryan.KELLY: I want to ask you before we go, show of hands. How many people at this table think Donald Trump is going to win the presidency?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think he can.KELLY: We have one.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think he can.KELLY: But if you have to bet. You're at the Vegas table. You to choose. Red or black.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tough.KELLY: No prediction?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's possible. I just don't think it's probable.KELLY: And you guys?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's very hard for...KELLY: Hillary? I know you don't want he but...(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's very hard for a republican to win nationally now. So, you have to do something -- take the votes that were in the last election and grow.You know, Barbara Stahl as she says politics is about addition. And it's very, very difficult. And I don't see the formulation of that coming together to be able to add new people, keep the ones that we had to win the White House.KELLY: I give you the last word, Mo.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If the democrats run the right race, Hillary Clinton will be the president and win it easily, handily. If democrats run the wrong race, Donald Trump could eke it out. I don't think there's an in between. I think he wins it very narrowly or she wins in a landslide. But we can lose it. Democrats can lose this if we don't take this seriously.KELLY: Thank you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.KELLY: So much. Great discussion.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you. Carry on regardless.KELLY: Amen.Every big TV event has a back story and you'll see ours next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: More than 5.2 million people watch our special on the Fox Broadcast Network.
