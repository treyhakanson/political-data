This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!BILL O'REILLY, HOST: In the ""Weekdays with Bernie"" segment tonight it seems every few weeks we get another dose of racial politics at the presidential level. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC ANCHOR: Barack Obama is the first African- American president. OK. Is there going to be a reluctance on the part of the voters and the political community that talks politics as we get into November about dumping the first African president -- African-American president? Is that going to be something that just ratchets to ""Wait a minute here. This guy is going to knock out the first guy who ever got aboard?"" (END VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: Joining us now from Miami, the purveyor of BernardGoldberg.com, Mr. Goldberg. All right. So I don't know. I just -- I thought Barack Obama ran a very worthy campaign in 2008. He didn't get into the racial stuff at all, wanted to stay away from it. McCain respected that. And it's like, you know, Michael Corleone: ""Just when I thought I was out, they drag me back in."" Why? Why are they doing it? BERNARD GOLDBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Right. So you want to know why... O'REILLY: Yes. Goldberg: ... and the answer really, Bill, is pretty simple. It's because he's a liberal, and like many liberals, he's obsessed with race. Ann Coulter was right when she said the two groups in America that are obsessed with race, that see everything through a racial filter, are skinheads and liberals. I mean, it's true. Now let me give you a little background on Chris Matthews and why I say that he's obsessed with race. In 2010 after Barack Obama delivered the State of the Union message, Chris Matthews went on the air and said -- this is a verbatim quote -- ""I forgot he was black tonight for an hour."" He forgot Barack Obama was black. About the Tea Party he said -- and again, a verbatim quote -- ""They're all White. All of them. Every single one of them is White."":' Never mind that that's factually incorrect. What if it were true? There's no crime about being White. Then, when Barack Obama ran for president in 2008, Chris Matthews said, quote, ""This gets very ethnic, but the fact that Barack Obama is good at basketball doesn't surprise anybody."" Thank God, Bill, you didn't say that. Now, here's the point: actually the question he raised -- ""Will there be reluctance to toss Barack Obama out because he's black?"" -- it's not a bad question. And you and I could have that discussion. But when someone who is obsessed with race, like Chris Matthews apparently is, when he brings that question up, I'm wondering if he's really saying that Barack Obama should not be tossed out precisely because he's the first black president. I don't know if he means that, but I would have to wonder if he means that. O'REILLY: I wouldn't have the discussion with you about the question of whether Barack Obama should lose his job because of race, because it's a speculative question and nobody can know. We know that there are certain people who vote for Barack Obama because he's black, and there are certain Americans who vote against him because he's black. I think those numbers are small, but we know they're there. And otherwise, it really doesn't matter. And you made an interesting point. If I had said about the basketball -- when I asked Barack Obama in the Super Bowl interview, I said, ""Are you a football guy? Do you follow football?"" I was immediately branded a racist by Media Matters, because I was saying -- I was asking him whether he followed football or not. How am I supposed to know? That was a racist question. But it's so -- I don't know why, why this conversation has to center around a man's color at all, ever. I don't think it should. He should be elected or defeated based on his record. That's it! GOLDBERG: I -- every reasonable person agrees with that, but you asked the question, why is he bringing it up? Liberals, many of them, not all of them, but many of them are obsessed with race. They see everything through a filter of race. So in 2008 there were articles that said, if Barack Obama loses, there is only one reason: racism in America. Now there's a suggestion if he's not reelected, it could be -- right -- because of racism in America. O'REILLY: I guess. I just think it's insane. All right. Last week Bernie and I, you know, we were talking about media bias in organizations that are in business not to inform anymore. They're just pushing an agenda. And the Washington Post weighed in on their blog, and you want to say something about that? GOLDBERG: Well, yes. Eric Wemple wrote -- he -- you made the point that, since nobody trusts the media anymore, they won't have much of an effect on the election. I said I think you're absolutely right. So this fellow ended his piece by saying, ""If the impact of media bias is so trivial, why do these guys"" -- you and me -- ""why do these guys harp on it each week?"" Well, first of all, we don't harp on it. We talk about it. Secondly, there are many smart, thoughtful, serious people who write about the media, but Eric Wemple, sadly, is not one of them. So, let me try to explain to Eric and everybody else why media bias does matter. Not because it affects an election, but because we all know that you can't live in a free country without a free press. We all know that. But you know what else? You can't live in a free country for long without a fair press. We need a strong mainstream media. That's why you and I criticize it, because we know we need in a flee country a strong mainstream media. And that means when the media sounds the alarm about something, when they tell us there's a problem out there, we need to trust them. We need to believe them. We need to -- if we don't believe them, we're not going to pay attention when they sound the alarm. The Founding Fathers gave the media a lot of power, and they put it in the First Amendment. Not the Eighth Amendment or the 13th Amendment. The First Amendment. And they gave -- they put no restraints on that power. When you have that much power, you have a lot of responsibility. So, Eric Wemple of the Washington Post, you ought to know this, but since you don't, let's just make clear: it's not about whether the media affects the next election or not. That's not what we're talking about. We're talking about, in a free country, you need a fair and honest media, and that's why we talk about it each week. O'REILLY: Right. And we don't have that right now. We don't have that right now. GOLDBERG: Not right now. O'REILLY: It's getting way, way out of control. All right. Bernie, thanks very much. We appreciate it.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: The U.S. and Britain trying to identify the ISIS killer who beheaded James Foley, the executioner speaking with the British video. It is a disturbing reminder that ISIS is recruiting members from western nations.Former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, joins us. Good evening, sir.JOHN BOLTON, FORMER U.N. AMBASSADOR: Good evening.VAN SUSTEREN: Prime Minister David Cameron coming off vacation, rushing back to London.BOLTON: Well, I think it demonstrates a sense of responsibility that this could well be a British citizen who is involved in this execution and it could well be beyond that that British intelligence does have some idea who this person is, who he might be connected to inside Britain so that the prime minister wants to be there in case there are other operations that have to take place against people in a larger conspiracy already in London.VAN SUSTEREN: You know, I assume that they are doing very sort of sophisticated analysis on the accent, because even, you know, an American speaking you can tell whether the person is from the south or the Midwest or the east. I imagine they are doing everything they can to almost identify the neighborhood.BOLTON: Yeah, I think they want to find out what locality, what nationality this person's parents were from. Did he come as a small child? Has he been there? And, you know, there is a question whether they have other videos or tapes or intercepts or whatever of this person and other contexts, too.VAN SUSTEREN: What do you make of the breaking news tonight that the Pentagon has released the information that they had a failed rescue mission, supposedly trying to get, perhaps, Mr. Foley?BOLTON: I think this is a stunning breech of security for the United States. Obviously, ordered by the White House, I cannot conceive of the Pentagon releasing this on their own. This is exactly the sort of thing that should remain completely confidential for 50 years, number one, because it tells people what we try to do. Number two, it's an admission of failure. Well, the United States tried again and couldn't do it. Number three, whoever was -- we relied upon, whoever gave us the tip is now in jeopardy from the Islamic State and they will be dead already. This is just not something do you.VAN SUSTEREN: I think -- you know, I'm always hammering the administration for not being transparent.BOLTON: This is a covert operation. It's not supposed to be transparent.VAN SUSTEREN: I'm just trying to avoid being as much as a hypocrite sometimes I find myself unfortunately being. I tried not to be. But the thing that disturbs me here is the failed intelligence and what in the world -- I mean, is our intelligence so bad? I mean, I'm very hard on the CIA director, who has now admitted to domestic spying which is a crime, and getting off an apology. You know, is our intelligence that bad that we could show up on a rescue mission and nobody is there.BOLTON: Well, it's happened before. It happened to Vietnam. We know these things are possible, but I think over the years, our intelligence -- our ability to gather intelligence through the United States and its agents itself has deteriorated markedly. And what we need is a vast expansion of our own intelligence gathering capability, not relying on other countries.VAN SUSTEREN: Do you think this was information about the failed thing was really for political reasons? Is it to make it look like the administration was really engaged in trying to find him? Is that why?BOLTON: I can't think of any other reason to release this? The whole nature of clandestine operations rests on the belief that you can conduct an operation and keep it from coming out. And if you fail to do that, you are telling your adversaries what your capabilities are and even worse here, to say that it was a failed operation. I think these guys probably got in. They found that the target area was empty of the prisoners and they got out without anybody knowing about it or at least without anybody understanding what it happened. That's a success from a clandestine operation point of view. Even if you didn't get the prisoners, they got out without being detected. Now, we have given it up. I'm just stunned at this.VAN SUSTEREN: And what in the world could trigger it tonight, but anyway, we will work on that one.BOLTON: Politics.VAN SUSTEREN: Politics. Anyway, ambassador, thank you, sir.BOLTON: Thank you."	[]	[]

 Historical Perspective on the Politics of Debt 
"	Twenty five years ago, when Congress was locked in a fierce debate about the rising budget deficits of the Reagan years, a conservative House member named Newt Gingrich derided his fellow Republican, Senator Bob Dole, as the tax collector for the welfare state.It was a sign of the times, but the deficits of those years were trifling compared to those of today and the debate will soon be on about what to do about them.What drove Gingrich's characterization of Dole was the tendency of some Republicans, confronted with mushrooming spending on benefit programs prized by Democrats, to agree to large tax increases to pay for them.But Republican efforts to rein in spending on Social Security and Medicare -- the two big drivers of the growing debt -- have repeatedly a) failed and b) made them ripe targets for Democratic attacks: Witness George W. Bush's failed effort to reform Social Security by partially privatizing it.Democrats, fresh from creating a new health care entitlement, no doubt sense they have set yet another trap for Republicans. If Republicans resist heavy new taxes to offset the deficits, they will have to support the kinds of serious benefit cuts the public has repeatedly gagged on in the past.But public alarm about spending has never been as intense as it is today. Some Republicans, such as Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, who has a serious plan involving serious cuts, are betting it will be different this time.We'll see.-- Brit Hume is the senior political analyst for Fox News Channel.
