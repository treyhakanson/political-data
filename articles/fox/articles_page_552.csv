This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" November 11, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)JANE SANDERS, BERNIE SANDERS WIFE: And 15 states that Bernie won went to Trump. And 90,000 people in Michigan voted all the way down ticket, all the other races, but didn't say anything in the general election in the presidential race. We will see that all over the country. People are hungry for new direction. I think that's why Trump has won this election. They want change.MATT BENNETT, THIRD WAY: This is the worst shape that our party has been in since reconstruction in the 1920s or before in the 1870s. We lost across the board. We lost very progressive people. We lost moderates. We lost everybody.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Well, the map does look a bit red today as we get ready for a Trump administration. As we mentioned before, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid outgoing issuing a statement today, ""If this is a time of healing, we must first put the responsibility for healing where it belongs, at the feet of Donald Trump, a sexual predator who lost the popular vote and fueled his campaign with bigotry and hate. Winning the Electoral College does not absolve Trump of the grave sins he committed against millions of Americans.""Senator Joe Manchin just responded with a statement, Democrat from West Virginia. ""Senator Harry Reid's statement today attacking president-elect Trump is wrong. It's an absolute embarrassment to the Senate as an institution, our Democratic party, and the nation. I want to be very clear he does not speak for me. Senator Reid's words needlessly feed the very divisiveness that is tearing this country apart. Now more than ever it's time for us to all come together as Americans. Unfortunately there are some who forget that at times like these it is wrong to put party and politics above our country."" Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia.Let's bring in our panel, syndicated columnist George Will, Leslie Marshall, syndicated talk radio host, and Charles Hurt, political columnist for The Washington Times. You heard the historical references for the Democratic Party where it stands now. George, your thoughts?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Hysteria is overwhelming Democrats like that staffer who said climate change is going to kill her in 10 years or so. Hillary Clinton is a historically untalented politician and she won the popular vote. Republicans have lost the popular vote in six of the last seven elections, so they're not an irresistible juggernaut.Our political parties are amazingly supple market mechanisms and they adjust very fast. In 1964, the Goldwater debacle, the Republicans lose 44 states. Goldwater candidacy gets less than 40 percent of the vote, and everyone said they are going to disappear. They won five of the next six presidential elections. So it's a little premature to write the obituaries for the world's oldest political party, which the Democratic Party is.BAIER: Although there was some parts that just did not hear what was happening, obviously, Leslie. I talked to Senator Jim Webb as he was getting ready to run for president, and this is part of the interview.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JIM WEBB, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Who would be the represented party for the working people in the country? And that has the traditional role of the Democratic Party. The people who have no voice in the quarters of power could always count on the Democratic party to be talking about those issues, economic fairness issues particularly.BAIER: You said Democrats could do a better job with white working people. But you concede in recent years that particular group has gone to the GOP.WEBB: I totally agree they have. This is a values-centered culture. This is a culture that does not envy wealth. It's a culture that's very heavy on personal honor, military service.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: It's like they didn't listen to him at all.LESLIE MARSHALL, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: You know what's interesting is Hillary didn't listen to her husband. If you remember Bill Clinton warned about disenfranchised white voters years ago. And we all know it's the economy, stupid, economy 101.And one of the things that my candidate -- and I'm still in the angry denial phase. I'm moving forward, though. One of the things she didn't do was address the economic woes of the nation, which is the working class, the middle class, not visiting Wisconsin as an example. And not putting forth -- Democrats are the party of unions, and look at those workers and look at the demographics of those workers among the working class. She wasn't speaking to them. She wasn't giving a plan. How are we going to bring jobs back?Donald Trump spoke about jobs. We saw in the polls, although we don't want to look to those much, that he was stronger with regard to the economy because of not only his business background but what he was saying to the people as he was campaigning all along. And that's what people are most concerned about is the economy, is jobs, is their bottom line. And that wasn't addressed.BAIER: How does he take that and turn it to governing?CHARLES HURT, WASHINGTON TIMES: Well, it will be interesting to see. It's going to be an uphill battle because, obviously, his campaign was very much a populist one. He is going to have to work with Republicans, conservatives in Congress, which I don't think is a bad way to go, and I think good results can come of that.But, you know, the revolution that sort of catapulted the Republican Party through what it has been through over the past 18 months I feel like is still waiting to happen inside the Democratic Party, and with all these WikiLeaks and all this kind of stuff that we're seeing just how much the system worked behind the scenes to get -- to make sure Hillary Clinton got the nomination. I think that there's going to be -- there's going to be hell to pay for that going forward.BAIER: I want to turn to The Wall Street Journal has an interview with Donald Trump, the president-elect, in which he says that after conferring with President Obama, he would consider leaving in place certain parts of the Affordable Care Act, indication of possible compromise after a campaign in which he pledged repeatedly to repeal the 2010 health law. In health care, Mr. Trump said a big reason for his shift from his call for all out repeal was that Thursday meeting at the White House with the president who he said suggested areas of the Affordable Care Act to preserve. ""I told him I will look at his suggestions out of respect. I will do that. Either Obamacare will be amended or repealed and replaced,"" Mr. Trump said. Here is what Paul Ryan said last night on the show.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. PAUL RYAN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: Obamacare is failing so it has to get replaced quickly. That's clearly high on our list.BAIER: You had passed a bill to repeal and replace. It got vetoed by President Obama. But it was the replace part that we never had a sense that Republican were singing from the same sheet of music on what it looked like.RYAN: That was our better way agenda was about. So 274 House Republicans all agreed and signed up for a full replacement plan. Donald and I spoke of this today. We're on same page on these things. And it resembles exactly the kinds of reforms that he was talking about.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: George, if you look on the website, the better way plan does say ""Our plan gives you more control, more choices, and our plan makes sure that you never have to worry about being turned away or having your coverage taken away regardless of age, income, medical conditions, or circumstances."" It goes on. But the point being here is it's in every replace option that the Republicans currently have. So this isn't necessarily a shift for Donald Trump, is it?WILL: No. Donald Trump is acknowledging it seems to me a change in the national ethic. To some extent Barack Obama propelled it. To some extent he just took advantage of it. But the American people have decided that everyone ought to have health insurance. And whatever comes next is going to -- it can do without a mandate, it can do with premium support. But everyone will have it.And 125 years ago, medicine was too small a part of our economy to appear in national income statistics. People were born at home. They died at home. And all medicine could do is make you comfortable while nature healed you or killed you. Today we have this amazingly competent medicine, 18 percent of our economy. Our health care sector is larger than all but five national economies in the world, and people feel very much as though they have a piece of this.BAIER: Leslie, do you think he's shifting, changing, even though it's kind of part of the plan they had on table?MARSHALL: I expected this. I think honestly candidates when they become elected do it on both side in whatever office, whatever level, state or federal. But one of the things that I looked at are, what are the experts saying that crunch the numbers that are nonpartisan? What they're saying is some of the problems Republicans are going to have are some of the problems the Democrats have with Obamacare, which is finances, which is transition.And you are looking at millions of people. And millions could be affected negatively and left off, and in addition, the pre-existing conditions, which obviously they address. I don't feel this is a replacement. I feel it's an amendment with a name change. And sometimes people might say, that's just semantics. That's all you need obviously in politics. Like you said, this is not Donald Trump's new way. This is in a sense Paul Ryan's, who interestingly enough just the other day, if you heard him speak, he said we're going to make amendments -- he said we're going to make amendments to, and then he said we're going to repeat, we're going to replace. So once again, this is an amended Obamacare plan in my opinion.HURT: You know, nobody more than you, George, have talked about over the years the waning power of Congress. And what I hope to see out of this is a contentious relationship between the Republicans in Congress and the Republican in the White House. And let them fight it out. And let the Republicans on Capitol Hill be the conservative bulwark to try to make some sense out of that. And if Donald Trump is going to negotiate with somebody, I would like him to be negotiating with the Republicans. I think it might work out better.BAIER: He did say in this article he was not going to move forward or didn't think he was going to move forward with a special prosecutor. He said he is thinking about many other things.WILL: That's last thing he needs is something from the campaign hanging over him.Just one more thing. If you get rid of the mandate and if you replace it with essentially a voucher that is health savings accounts, and if you have premium support to let people go into the market and buy what they want, that's not changing the name of Obamacare. That's fundamentally altering it.BAIER: And changing over state lines to increase competition.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Police claim the terrorist who murdered 49 innocent people was on the website of a controversial Imam. That Imam is a former gang leader turned bank robber who served time in prison and was released from prison last year. And today Imam Abu Taubah and his lawyer went On The Record.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VAN SUSTEREN: Imam, and thank you both for joining us.DANIEL BRODERSEN, MARCUS ROBERTSON'S LAWYER: Thank you, Greta.MARCUS ROBERTSON, AKA IMAM ABU TAUBAH: Thank you very much for having us.VAN SUSTEREN: Tough time here in this community.IMAM ABU TAUBAH: Yeah, it is.VAN SUSTEREN: Do you know the man who is Mateen?IMAM ABU TAUBAH: I do not. The person known as Omar Mateen, has been reports saying that he was a student of mine. That is totally not true. He never registered at our school. He never took classes at our school. I don't know him. Never met him those things are totally unfounded.VAN SUSTEREN: Has he never been to your school?IMAM ABU TAUBAH: No, never. We are online institution. So we don't have face- to-face classes but we do meet all our students online.VAN SUSTEREN: So even if he were online, you would know him.IMAM ABU TAUBAH: Yes, because we do face to face.VAN SUSTEREN: Dan, have you learned anything to the contrary?BRODERSEN: To my knowledge, Greta, there is absolutely no evidence that Mr. Mateen was associated with my client, was acquainted with him, was a student of his or, for that matter, ever met him. To the extent that he was a follower of my client, that is completely without our knowledge.VAN SUSTEREN: Mateen, why is it, people are saying that, do you think? Or not Mateen, I'm sorry, Imam? Why are people saying that?IMAM ABU TAUBAH: You know there has been a false report. Someone erroneously put it out there that Omar Mateen was a follower of Timbuktu Seminary. I'm the main teacher at Timbuktu Seminary and people say these things. However, even went so far to say I was arrested and my companions were rounded up and that was untrue either. We haven't had any problems. We have been going on, doing business as usual. What we do teach is Quran. We don't teach paramilitary training or anything like that. We don't deal with politics either.What we preach in the United States is that it is not proper for any Muslim to take the law or the Islamic law at that into his own hands. And I personally don't think that this person was going to that club to cleanse them or to kill them because they were homosexualities. From what I understand he was a constant person there. He was going there for three years. So, I doubt he had a problem with that. Even one of the people said they knew him there. And that they had seen him getting kicked out for being drunk. Drinking is the same type of crime as having homosexual relationships. So I doubt that he was there for -- maybe he had a problem with his lover or something like that, because I heard that his wife said that he was gay and his father had called him gay in front of her. I don't know. But I do know is that whatever he did, he didn't do it on behalf of Islam.VAN SUSTEREN: So you disavow him? You disavow him as being a devout Muslim?IMAM ABU TAUBAH: I disavow the concept of anyone taking the law into their own hand. That is a terrible thing that happened to those people, 50 people getting killed, and 50 other people getting shot. Islam doesn't -- no one can justify that with Islam. Not using just Islam. There is no Islamic justification for that we can't even slap people in the face in Islam. You know, there are laws and there are rules. So, and that is a parent let alone as a law giver. The person was sick. The people or the person, because I also heard that, one of the guys that got shot 12 times said that, there were four shooters. So, I'm sure they are still doing their investigation, but, from what I see, whoever did that, they are trying to say they did it for ISIS or did it for Islam. That is not true. Islam does not stand for that I don't know about ISIS.VAN SUSTEREN: How do you account for -- what's your theory on why he was close to the first American who went over, a bomber in Syria, a suicide bomber? What's your theory on that?IMAM ABU TAUBAH: You know, personally, it's very hard to interrogate a dead person, you know. We hear about these suicide bombings. I personally don't believe that all those guys are suicide bombings. That is my personal.VAN SUSTEREN: What do you think they are?IMAM ABU TAUBAH: I don't know they are dead. We can't tell. You know, I mean I have different politics than that. I believe that those people get blown up and it helps policy to say they are blowing up something. But I don't know. Islam doesn't promote that so, you see, I have a problem when if someone said Muslims are doing something or doing something Islamic and saying they are doing it for Islam that is schizophrenia. So that doesn't make sense to me.VAN SUSTEREN: Well, what do you mean -- you have to admit there is an awful lot of terrorism associated with Islam, right or wrong?IMAM ABU TAUBAH: I do not agree.VAN SUSTEREN: Not good, let's get back to this.IMAM ABU TAUBAH: I'm just saying.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. So Mateen didn't, is not one of your followers. He has never been to your seminary and never been online as far as you know.IMAM ABU TAUBAH: No, period. We know.VAN SUSTEREN: Period, nothing. No. Have you checked?IMAM ABU TAUBAH: Yes. We double-checked.VAN SUSTEREN: Ok, double-checked. You are getting threats.IMAM ABU TAUBAH: Death threats.VAN SUSTEREN: Death threats and people in the media are falsely reporting that Mateen is targeting.(CROSSTALK)IMAM ABU TAUBAH: They are promoting, you know terrorism. It's the people terrorizing us and we asked them to stop. We do not have anything to do, we are pleading with you. We don't have anything to do with this. Our heart goes out to the victims and we didn't ever train this guy, never met him. He is not a student of ours.VAN SUSTEREN: And you condemn the act but you don't condemn him, Mateen, because your.IMAM ABU TAUBAH: From religious grounds we condemn acts. We don't condemn people. You know, we hate the act. We don't hate the person.VAN SUSTEREN: And you hate this act.IMAM ABU TAUBAH: And we hate this act. This is not the act that can be justified by Islam, ok at all.(END VIDEO CLIP)"
