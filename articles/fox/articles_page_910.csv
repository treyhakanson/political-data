This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST (voice-over):  Tonight, on this special edition of 'Hannity'...DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Crooked Hillary, crooked, crooked Hillary!  She is a crooked -- she is a crooked person!  Hillary Clinton is a weak person.  Hillary Clinton is totally scripted.  Hillary Clinton is a thief!  I think she's pathetic.  I think she should be in jail for what she did with her e-mails, OK?HANNITY:  Donald Trump takes on Hillary Clinton.TRUMP:  I think the only card she has is the woman's card.  She's got nothing else going.HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  ... then deal me in!(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP:  She shouts into the microphone, and it drives everybody crazy!  And frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she'd get 5 percent of the vote.  Clinton wants to tax and regulate our workers to the point of extinction.CLINTON:  We're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.TRUMP:  Crooked Hillary wants to terminate--she wants to abolish our 2nd Amendment!  Clinton also wants totally open borders in America.  I haven't even started on her.  We haven't even started!(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HANNITY:  ""Hannity"" starts right here, right now.(END VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY:  And welcome to this special edition of ""Hannity: Trump takes on Hillary Clinton.""  And tonight for the hour, we're going to show you all the things that Donald Trump can do to defeat Hillary Clinton in a general election.Now, earlier this week, the presumptive Republican nominee revealed he is preparing to give a major speech that exposes his Democratic rival.  Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  The Clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves!  They've made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government contracts.  And I mean hundreds of millions of dollars!  Secretary Clinton even did all of the work on a totally illegal private server!I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week, and we're going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons.  I think you're going to find it very informative.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Now, we sat down this week with Donald Trump, Jr., to ask him how he thinks his father plans to take on Hillary Clinton.  Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  All right, joining us now is Donald Trump, Jr.  All right, so your dad's going to give this big speech on Monday, and he said he's going to bring up a lot of issues involving Hillary.  I actually have, you know, just the list of Hillary scandals.  I mean, let's go through this.  You got...DONALD TRUMP, JR., DONALD TRUMP'S SON:  Hey, Sean, I only see...HANNITY:  ... Travelgate...TRUMP JR.:  ... two or three-hundred of pages of paper there.  That can't possibly be enough.HANNITY:  Travelgate, Whitewater, Filegate, removing files from Vince Foster's office.  You got the lost Rose firm billing records.  You've got the Commerce Department's pay-to-play junkets, renting the Lincoln bedroom, John Huang, Charlie Tree (ph) and Johnny Chung (ph).TRUMP JR.:  Yes.HANNITY:  You got ""no controlling legal authority,"" Al Gore's statement. You got Monica Lewinsky, Katherine Willey, Juanita Broaddrick, Dolly Kyle (ph).  You've got pardongate.  Then you've got the Bosnian sniper lie. Then you got Benghazi, the e-mail scandal, the speaking fees, which are absurd.  They make $50 million in two years, 2013 and 2015, and the Clinton Foundation.TRUMP JR.:  Great public servants, Sean.  Great public servants.HANNITY:  Yes, they're really looking out for the people.TRUMP JR.:  And I think that's -- the American people see that, you know, and it's -- by the way, it's so much more than even that.But as a basic student of statistics, there can't be that much smoke without fire.  Now, they've been very protected, you know, the media -- I mean, we watched the canned speech the other night, and everything like that, and everyone talks about it like it was the greatest speech given in history of all speeches whatsoever.  I mean, it was (INAUDIBLE) after about line number two, you realize, OK, canned -- it was a phoner.It's just -- there's so much phoniness there.  There's so much there.  You know now the problem is 95 percent of the media is -- they're backing, so we're up against the big machine.  But I guess the American people see it, Sean.  They're fed up with it.HANNITY:  You know, there's two schools of thought.  And Newt Gingrich, I think, has a great analysis of your dad, where he says he's always better when he goes big.TRUMP JR.:  Yes.HANNITY:  If he goes deep into the weeds Monday on the speech that he's going to do about Hillary -- you know, isn't it really about the judges?  Isn't it about balancing a budget, energy independence, fixing the VA, building our military, sending education back to the states, building the wall, you know, better trade deals?TRUMP JR.:  It's about jobs.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP JR.:  It's about jobs, Sean.  Is that -- honestly, if there's one resounding theme to anything that he's done, anything that he's talked about, it's jobs.  That's why he's resonating with blue-collar Americans. That's why, you know, some of the union demographics and some of these demographics that wouldn't otherwise ever vote Republican because their bosses tell them not to -- that's why all those guys come up to me in the streets and say, Hey, tell him to go.It's about, you know, the police officers and all those guys saying, Hey --I mean, there's not one of those people is going to vote -- because they get it.  They see it.  He's given the hard-working people of this country a voice, the people that built this country, the people that are the manufacturers, the people that made it what it is and made it great.All those jobs that have been shipped abroad, all those companies that have been forced out of the country -- he's talking about bringing them back. He wants to put people to work.And then guess what you can do with that surplus?  How about educate our kids?  How about take care of vets?  You know, how about, you know, fix this broken health care system?  And you know, of course, I'm sure they won't talk about the new premiums coming out for ObamaCare, you know, until after the election.  But you know, everyone that (INAUDIBLE) you know, when they triple and quadruple the prices on this health care, you know, that's not free health care for everyone.HANNITY:  You know...TRUMP JR.:  That's going to be a total disaster.HANNITY:  So go to the strategy.  Go to the tactics.TRUMP JR.:  Yes.HANNITY:  Is it better to -- maybe mention all these things, certainly, but is it better to talk about those jobs and talk about...TRUMP JR.:  Honestly, I think he's doing it.HANNITY:  (INAUDIBLE) part of it, yes.TRUMP JR.:  I think he's going to do both.HANNITY:  Yes.TRUMP JR.:  I think he's going to do both because you have to because, you know, the left, and with the media -- you know, again, 95 percent of the media so far on the -- you know, it's like they're looking through...HANNITY:  It's horrible.TRUMP JR.:  ... the world with rose-colored glasses, and everyone's great, everyone's (INAUDIBLE) everyone's (INAUDIBLE) You know, I'd love to world to be that way.  The problem is we actually have to deal with reality for a change.And you know, the liberal media has done such a good job of trying to paint her as this angelic, you know, savior of the people!  I mean, it's crazy, Sean!  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills when I wake up in the morning and I watch the news!HANNITY:  Don't watch it.  That's what I do.  But it was a coronation, and she could barely cross the finish line against the 74-year-old...TRUMP JR.:  Socialist!HANNITY:  ... socialist curmudgeon and angry man!  It's pathetic!TRUMP JR.:  Yes.  It's scary.  But you know, she's still being anointed (INAUDIBLE) you know, we're not just battling, you know, the DNC.  We're battling the entire media machine.  And we're going to change this.  And my father's done a good job of that and...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP JR.:  ... is we changed the game.  Let people speak their mind.  Let people actually talk about the truth for a change!  You know, that -- that's what people are forgetting.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP JR.:  ... so many lies...HANNITY:  ... overall jobs...TRUMP JR.:  When you talk about unemployment, another lie.  You know, low unemployment numbers.  It's crazy!HANNITY:  But I think the most interesting thing, when you say jobs or you sum it up with jobs, is that one in six American men 18 to 34 are out of the labor force or incarcerated.  And one in five American families -- imagine this -- don't have a single family member working!  Not one.  All dependent on government.TRUMP JR.:  (INAUDIBLE) I don't understand.  I mean, the left and their policies all caused all of this, right?  If we put people back to work, you solve all of these problems naturally, OK?You solve all of these problems naturally.  And that's what I don't understand, whether it be, you know, African-American youth, 50 percent -- north of 50 percent unemployment.  I mean, think about that number, Sean!  That's scary!  That's crazy!(CROSSTALK)TRUMP JR.:  Hey, guess what?  You put some of those guys back to work.  Same with the Latino community, right?  There's a lot of unemployment.  And guess where that unemployment's coming from?  They're being undercut by illegal immigration, which is the Democrats -- they love to let everyone in.  They want to ensure (ph) their jobs.  They want to let them in, let them vote, give them health care, pay for it -- you know, the American taxpayer actually has to pay for that.  It doesn't just grow on trees.  It's not magically, you know, we miracle (ph) the health care to everyone.  Doesn't work that way!  It has to come from somewhere.So you know where that's coming from?  That's coming from hard-working people.  They're basically funding everyone else's...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP JR.:  It doesn't work!HANNITY:  You have 11 million illegal people, so you have 95 million Americans out of the labor force.  They're now competing for the limited jobs available and they're driving down wages if you do get a job.TRUMP JR.:  Of course.  I mean, all of those people should be voting Republican to end some of this nonsense.  It's a farce, but it's something that's been perpetuated within their communities and within their this.  I mean, I hear it.  I've heard it from friends of mine that are (INAUDIBLE) Hey, my friends who are Latin, and you know, work -- whether it's construction (INAUDIBLE) you know, they're saying that even the people that are here legally, they're going to be deported.You know, there's a whole mechanism out there basically feeding lies into the system, perpetuating the nonsense that's basically oppressing all of these demographics that are hard-working people, that are doing a great job, that went through the process legally that deserve to be here and are great Americans!(END VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY:  And coming up next on this special edition of ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  She broke federal law by putting her e-mails on a secret private server that foreign countries could easily get to and hack!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Donald Trump -- he's slamming Hillary Clinton over her private e-mail server scandal.  Judge Jeanine Pirro and Jay Sekulow -- they're here tonight with reaction.Also later tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  And Hillary, if you look and see a study (ph), Hillary hurt many women, the women that he abused.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Donald Trump -- he's going after Hillary really hard over her real record with women.  Monica Crowley, Kimberly Guilfoyle -- they're here to weigh in on that and much more on this special edition of ""Hannity,"" ""Trump takes on Hillary,"" as we continue.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)HANNITY:  And welcome back to this special edition of ""Hannity: Trump takes on Hillary.""  Now, the presumptive Democratic nominee's private e-mail server scandal -- well, that's been a major campaign issue.  And Donald Trump -- he's not been afraid to go after it on the campaign trail.  Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  She broke federal law by putting her e-mails on a secret private server that foreign countries could easily get to and hack!  By the way, Hillary Clinton is missing 30,000 e-mails.  They've been deleted,  30,000!I think she should be in jail for what she did with her e-mails, OK?Who would be so stupid to do what she did with her e-mails?  I have people that will retrieve those e-mails!  Frankly, what Hillary has done is criminal, folks!  It's criminal.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  And earlier this week, well, Hillary Clinton -- well, she made this shocking statement to our own Bret Baier.  Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, HOST, ""SPECIAL REPORT"":  The Clinton Foundation investigation, the FBI investigation, the e-mail, you're saying zero chance that this is a problem for you in this election.CLINTON:  Absolutely.  That's what I'm saying.  That happens to be the truth.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Zero chance.  Here with reaction, the host of ""Justice,"" Judge Jeanine Pirro, and with the American Center for Law and Justice, Jay Sekulow.From everything that I've been able to ascertain, and all the interviews and investigations we've done -- she deleted the 30,000 e-mails, Bryan Pagliano -- he's now -- he pled the 5th.  Now he's got a level of immunity in his particular case -- tells me that something serious has been discovered.Is there -- are there laws broken here?  Do we know that?JEANINE PIRRO, HOST, ""JUSTICE"":  Look, I think so.  But you do not give someone immunity from prosecution -- and that's just the Department of justice, not the FBI -- unless there is something worth giving...HANNITY:  It's limited immunity, so you know...PIRRO:  Well, limited immunity means that he's already given them a proffer of what he intends to say...JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE:  Right.PIRRO:  ... and they're saying that, You are protected.  We will not prosecute you if you say that thing.HANNITY:  Unless they find it independently.  Then they -- they can...PIRRO:  Right, right, right.HANNITY:  The same information.PIRRO:  Unless they find it independently.  But here's the significant part of this.  Her reaction is so smug, it is so arrogant, it is so condescending to Brett Baier -- absolutely no chance.  Well, who told you that, Hillary?  Did you speak to Jim Comey with the FBI?  We know you didn't because you haven't done that yet.  Did you speak to the inspector general?  No, you refused to talk to him.And what makes you think that you're clear, especially if you don't even remember signing a nondisclosure?  So your memory is good for some things but not for others!HANNITY:  All right, Jay, let's go -- I've had Rudy Giuliani, Judge Jeanine.  I've had yourself on. We've identified anywhere between 16 and 18 potential laws that were broken.  What do you see in terms of the law? What do we know?  Doesn't she have to, as a top priority, make sure, maintain that -- the safety of these e-mails, and knowingly not doing that is a problem?SEKULOW:  Yes, and Sean, that included the location of the server.  And what is fascinating is that since the inspector general's report came out -- and this was President Obama's inspector general, so this was not a Republican, a conservative -- that inspector general's report pointed out the fact that no one in the Office of Legal Counsel in the State Department approved this or even was aware of this off-site server situation.So I keep going back to the initial issue that drew everything in, and that was the server in Colorado by this company that was, you know, hosting it without approval of the government.  We now know that the Office of Legal Counsel within the State Department never authorized it nor approved it or was even aware of it.  That's one.Number two, the aspect of securing the e-mails is also a federal law.  Now, I'm with Judge Jeanine on this completely.  The idea that she doesn't think this is an issue is, of course, absurd!HANNITY:  Well, wait a minute...SEKULOW:  Of course it's an issue...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  The names of CIA personnel...SEKULOW:  Yes.  Right.HANNITY:  ... could very well have been compromised here.  That means their lives are put in jeopardy because of the mishandling of this information.SEKULOW:  Because the designation in those e-mails going back and forth, including some that were released, had information that would point to individuals that were either CIA operatives or on-ground assets, as they're called.  And anybody could have -- you know, sophisticated hackers could have -- in fact, I think they were hacked multiple times or at least certainly attempts.So Sean, all of that put our national security at risk.  But the question at the end of the day -- Judge Jeanine and I have spoken about this many times.  At the end of the day, here's going to be the question.  Will the -- let's assume James Comey's FBI said, Here's the case, to the U.S. attorney, to the attorney general.  Will they bring and indictment?  And I still think that politically, they're not going to do it.(CROSSTALK)SEKULOW:  Someone may get indicted, but I don't expect it to be the secretary.HANNITY:  Will they put forward a criminal referral after the FBI investigation?  Because then it becomes a Justice Department issue.  Then it becomes a political issue because then there's influence of Obama in this.SEKULOW:  Well, I think that the inspector general's report, if you just take that, there's your criminal referral, just the inspector general's report (INAUDIBLE) that case out.HANNITY:  I agree with you.  All right...SEKULOW:  So I expect that -- I would not be shocked at all or surprised even if a referral comes out.  The question will be...HANNITY:  All right, let's go through this.SEKULOW:  ... what the Justice Department does with it.HANNITY:  All right, we have satellite imaging of North Korea's nuclear sites in this.  We have top secret information.  We have even higher...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  ... special access program clearance.  Now we know that the names of CIA agents -- you know, it was such a big deal when it was Valerie Plame, who wasn't even a covert agent -- that was a big deal.  All of these things we now know.  And 30,000 deleted e-mails that probably weren't about a wedding, a funeral and yoga.So my question then is, what happens if there's a criminal referral by the director of the FBI?PIRRO:  If there is a criminal referral, then what happens is the Department of Justice, Loretta Lynch, would decide whether or not it should go into the grand jury and make a grand jury available.Remember, Jim Comey can't do this.  But I think that the -- you know, if you want to read the tea leaves, here's what you've got.  You've got the president saying, in light of what you just said, Sean -- and you're right, satellite imagery, all that other stuff -- I don't think what she did posed a national security problem.  She didn't endanger national security...HANNITY:  The president is saying this.PIRRO:  The president, Barack Obama!HANNITY:  By the way, he rushes to judgment a lot, Mr. Constitutional attorney.(CROSSTALK)PIRRO:  ... interfering with this investigation.HANNITY:  That's a lie.PIRRO:  So then you say to yourself, why is the president doing this?  You could say he wants another four years, you know, wants his legacy.  I'll tell you why, Sean.  The reason the president is saying this and the reason Loretta Lynch will not put it in the grand jury, because she works for the president, is because Barack Obama was communicating with Hillary Clinton on at least 18 e-mails.  And if Hillary Clinton is indicted, then she will call Barack Obama as a witness!  He will be someone who was knowing or knew that she was not on a secure server!  He is someone that we can...HANNITY:  But what if he just said, How are you today?  You know, what if they were innocuous...PIRRO:  It doesn't matter!(CROSSTALK)PIRRO:  First of all, he responded to two of them.  You think he gives a darn about yoga or the wedding?  No!  When the president of the United States knows that the secretary of state...HANNITY:  So he may be as guilty as her!PIRRO:  Exactly!  And that's why...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  All right, but wait a minute.  Then we got to take this to the next step, Jay.  All right, let's say everything Jeanine's saying is right.  OK.  So criminal referral, not indictment in part to protect the president.  Before the president leaves, he has an opportunity he can pardon her and pardon himself!SEKULOW:  Of course.  Listen, the pardon power is in the Constitution.  The president, as commander-in-chief and as president of the United States, his authority in the Constitution is he can grant pardons.  So of course he could pardon.  But I think what we go back to is because of the e-mail exchange between the president and the secretary of state on the private server -- it wasn't state.gov.  That's where I think the president's going to be hard pressed for his attorney general to authorize a criminal investigation.  I think you look at that in light of the...HANNITY:  But isn't it politically as damaging...(CROSSTALK)SEKULOW:  ... of Secretary Clinton -- I just think it's...HANNITY:  If the criminal referral's out and they don't indict her, then the argument's going to be she's being protected.  She's in a special class.  She's being treated differently.PIRRO:  Absolutely!  And that's why she's so sure because the fix is in! But here's the issue, Sean...HANNITY:  Yes, I think you're probably right.PIRRO:  In this election, you've got people who believe in Trump and people who believe in Hillary, and there's a very small group in the middle that this is going to matter to.  But at the end of the day, I'm not so sure it does.HANNITY:  But if James Comey were to resign...PIRRO:  Yes, Saturday night massacre.HANNITY:  ... if he puts forward a criminal referral, that would be a huge scandal in the country.All right, thank you both.  Thank you, Jeanine.  Thank you, Jay.SEKULOW:  Thanks, Sean.HANNITY:  And coming up next tonight on this special edition of ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  And Hillary, if you look and see a study (ph), Hillary hurt many women, the women that he abused!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Donald Trump is exposing Hillary Clinton's real record with women.  We'll check in with Monica Crowley and Kimberly Guilfoyle.  They're here to weigh in.And later tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Hillary Clinton also refuses to say the words ""radical Islam,"" even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Donald Trump calling out Hillary Clinton for refusing to say those words, ""radical Islam.""  Dr. Walid Phares and Pete Hegseth -- they're here tonight with reaction as this special edition of ""Hannity: Trump takes on Hillary,"" continues straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  She's married to a man who was the worst abuser of women in the history of politics!  She's married to a man who hurt many women, and Hillary, if you look and see a study, Hillary hurt many women, the women that he abused.Well, I think the only card she has is the woman's card.  She's got nothing else going.  And frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she'd get 5 percent of the vote.  The only thing she's got going is the woman's card.  And the beautiful thing is, women don't like her, OK?  And look how well I did with women tonight.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  And welcome back to this special edition of ""Hannity: Trump takes on Hillary Clinton.""Now, that was Donald Trump going after Hillary for her real record with women.  Joining us now with reaction, Fox News contributor Monica Crowley and the co-host of ""The Five,"" the hit show, Kimberly Guilfoyle.All right, she wants to play the gender card.  She's played the gender card, and it has boomeranged back against her because Donald Trump has been so clever in saying, OK, you want to play that game?  We'll play that game.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST, ""THE FIVE"":  Well, it's fair game, isn't it, because if you're going to say that that is one of your list of few and far between accomplishments, that you're somebody that's going to be a champion of women, you better have a record to back it up.Unfortunately, the fact pattern does not match her rhetoric in terms of what she's claiming to be.  She needs, obviously, the women's vote to able to succeed against him in the general election.  Look at the record, though.HANNITY:  Yes.GUILFOYLE:  I mean, it's abysmal in terms of what happened in that White House and how she treated people, including Monica Lewinsky, people that had, you know, relationships with her husband.HANNITY:  You know, we played on the show last night, Dee Dee Myers and George Stephanopoulos and all their comments.  She's vicious.  She has a horrible temper.  She belittles people.  This book that is coming out similarly.  But directly on the issue of women, OK, she'll take money from Saudi Arabia, countries that practice sharia, Monica, and has not been critical of those countries as long as they give to the Clinton Foundation.MONICA CROWLEY, FOX CONTRIBUTOR:  One of the biggest ruse (ph) of her big problem here is hypocrisy, her outrageous hypocrisy across the board, and specifically when we talk about women.  And you raised about taking money from regimes that oppress and persecute women.The Clinton Foundation, Sean, has accepted between $13 million and $40 million from regimes that do exactly that, including Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, Algeria, the UAE.  The Clinton Global Initiative still takes money from those regimes, while the Clinton Foundation, once this was exposed, backed off from taking that kind of money.She has to answer for this!HANNITY:  Have you ever been able...CROWLEY:  The hypocrisy (INAUDIBLE) that she's long been a champion of women and girls, while abusing the women and smearing the women who accused her husband and threatened his political...HANNITY:  Well, that's a second issue.CROWLEY:  ... viability!HANNITY:  Have you ever found a single example where any of these countries that practice very strict sharia -- and women can't drive, vote, go to school, can't -- or work without their husband's permission -- has there ever been an instance that you -- either of you have found where she has spoken out against those practices and those countries?CROWLEY:  Not when it comes to the Islamic world.  You'll remember back in 1995, when she was first lady, she gave a very famous U.N.-based speech in Beijing, China, talking about women's human rights, talking about freeing women from violence.  But she never directs that message specifically to the Islamic world, I guess because that's politically incorrect.HANNITY:  Well, but...CROWLEY:  And she's never put her money...HANNITY:  But they're also...CROWLEY:  ... where her mouth is!HANNITY:  ... getting a lot of money.  I mean, you're talking tens of millions of dollars!GUILFOYLE:  Right because that's what matters more, influence peddling and access and cash on demand, OK?  They -- they're interested in whoever's going to be the Clinton ATM machine, and it doesn't matter where it comes from, whether it's oppressive regimes that have not been good to women and children.  You're not going to see her stand for that first.  First the money, then we talk.  And that's how they do their deals!HANNITY:  You know, all right, so basically, they bought her silence as it relates to women.  So her first commitment is to the money, not to be the champion of women's rights.  So I would think that's a pretty effective ad for Donald Trump in this election, as soon as she goes to play identity politics and the gender card.CROWLEY:  That's right.  And he can specifically target that hypocrisy to the women vote.  Now, yes, she has a large female constituency who love the idea of the first female president in her.  But women generally have high unfavorable numbers geared toward her anyway.  They don't particularly like her.  That doesn't mean they won't vote for her, but they don't necessarily trust her.  Therefore, that leaves a huge opening for Donald Trump...GUILFOYLE:  Yes.CROWLEY:  ... to target those kinds of ads to...HANNITY:  But doesn't she have a bigger problem...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  ... Kimberly...GUILFOYLE:  Especially those young women and millennials that are supporting Bernie Sanders because they do not like Hillary Clinton!  They don't like what they're hearing about the corruption, about the e-mails, about the record, abysmal record as it relates to the treatment women and harassing...HANNITY:  But doesn't she have a bigger...GUILFOYLE:  ... and bad-mouthing people that were (INAUDIBLE) husband.HANNITY:  ... too, with men, than, say, Donald Trump, which has been chronicled a lot in the media, that he has a problem with women?  But so -- she has the bigger problem with men, and men are flocking to Trump.  And I think Monica's right in suggesting that a lot of those millennial women and others...GUILFOYLE:  Yes.  Absolutely.HANNITY:  ... can move over to the Trump side.GUILFOYLE:  And it's ripe for the picking.  It's a great opportunity to do that, and that's why you saw Donald Trump wisely in his address the other night, which I thought was very good, single out and talk about the Bernie Sanders supporters because it's more of that kind of, you know, corruption, corrupt Hillary Clinton, to say, Oh, look, lookit, she's trying to steal the election.  She doesn't want to play by the rules...HANNITY:  So you're saying Trump is going to win this battle.  If there's -- if it's about gender, you think Trump wins, Trump has better arguments.GUILFOYLE:  I think he has really strong arguments that are compelling and should matter, as it relates to character and integrity.HANNITY:  Yes.CROWLEY:  And one thing that Trump does, which we have not really seen in recent Republican presidential candidates, is he always stays on offense.  So he's like a -- he's like a junkyard dog, right?  He sinks his teeth into -- and he keeps going, which is something that the Clintons have not had to deal with over the course of the last 30 years!HANNITY:  By the way, and that's something maybe Republicans maybe can learn from because they've been spineless and gutless and...GUILFOYLE:  Well, you know, it's not time now...HANNITY:  ... timid.GUILFOYLE:  ... really for a traditional politician that's not going to be -- that's not going to take these shots that you should.  These are like easy layups because the record should be brought up.  She wants to be commander-in-chief, she's going to have to earn it and earn those votes, and she's going to have to answer for her record.HANNITY:  All right, guys...CROWLEY:  One -- one last point...HANNITY:  Real quick, yes.CROWLEY:  ... on the millennial vote, which Kimberly raised.  There is a method, there's a reason to why he keeps raising Bill Clinton's track record in terms of abusing and assaulting women, allegedly.  And that's because he's trying to reach millennials, both men and women, the younger voters, because the culture has changed. The whole culture of rape culture on campus and so on, they're thinking it's different and they're hearing this for the first time.  SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST:  And this is a very different time, you point out.  I think it will be not brushed aside like in past years.  Guys, thank you both, appreciate it.  And coming up next on this special edition of ""Hannity"" --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Hillary Clinton also refuses to stay the words ""radical Islam"" even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Donald Trump slamming Hillary Clinton for refusing to use that term ""radical Islam."" And then later tonight --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment.  She wants to abolish it, abolish it.  (BOOS)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Donald Trump is not mincing words, and he's saying that Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the right to keep and bear arms.  We'll have reaction to all of that as this special edition of ""Hannity: Trump Takes on Hillary,"" continues.    (COMMERCIAL BREAK)JACKIE IBANEZ, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Live from America's news headquarters, I'm Jackie Ibanez.  Mitt Romney with some harsh words for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.  In an interview, Romney, who ran for president in 2012, says he's worried that Trump is promoting, quote, ""trickledown racism"" and is appealing to the racist tendencies of some Americans.  Romney even saying he will consider voting for the libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson.  A federal appeals court ruling that Kansas can't block voters from casting ballots because they didn't prove their U.S. citizenship when registering to vote.  Earlier this year a U.S. district judge said the enforcement of Kansas proof of citizenship law had disenfranchised more 18,000 otherwise eligible voters.  Four states have such laws, but Kansas is the only state that fully enforces it.  I'm Jackie Ibanez.  Now back to ""Hannity."" For all your headlines, log on to FoxNews.com.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  We're in a war against radical Islam, and unless you name the enemy you will never, ever solve the problem.  Hillary Clinton also refuses to say the words ""radical Islam"" even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country.  She won't use the term ""radical Islamic terrorism,"" you understand that.  (BOOS)TRUMP:  She wouldn't say it.  She refuses.  You know why she won't?  Because her president won't use it, that's why.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  And welcome back to this special edition of ""Hannity: Trump Takes on Hillary Clinton.""  That was Donald Trump calling out Clinton over her refusal to say the term ""radical Islam."" Here now with reaction, Fox News Middle East analyst and foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump, Dr. Walid Phares.  Also with us, the author of the bestseller ""In the Arena,"" Fox News contributor Peter Hegseth is with us.  Walid, when you really think about it, the Hillary-Obama era when she was secretary of state was the era of man-caused disasters, overseas contingency operations, apparently the secret deal negotiations with Iran began at that time, pulling out of Iraq, creating a vacuum for ISIS, all that is her legacy, and I haven't mentioned Benghazi or Libya or China or Putin.  That's not a record I think I would want to run on for foreign policy.  DR. WALID PHARES, TRUMP FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  No.  And I think the American people won't accept that record.  Basically the core of the problem that you just mentioned, Sean, is the refusal, systematic, constant refusal by the Obama/Clinton administration of using the right terms, the right words to designate the foe.  What they have done instead the past seven years, almost eight years now, is to give attributes.  This is extremists.  Of course they're extremists.  Oh, they're violent.  Definitely they are violent.  They are killing people.  What they have not accepted to do is to call them Islamic radical, jihadists.  HANNITY:  Explain.  Why the mysterious reluctance and resistance to identifying America's enemies?  You know, they're not hiding the fact that they're our enemy.  They're saying they're going to attack us.  They say they're at war with us.  Why the resistance?  PHARES:  Because their advisers and their experts have told them that the root causes of terrorism, that violence, is not the ideology.  It's foreign policy, social economics, jobs, what have you.  And of course, it's wrong.  HANNITY:  The Jihadi program that we had discussed at length.  You know, we learned this week, Pete, too, that it's costing $20,000 for the taxpayers for every Syrian refugee we're taking in that we're told by our national director of intelligence, FBI director, assistant FBI director, House homeland security chairman, our former special envoy to defeat ISIS, they're all saying what ISIS has said, they'll infiltrate the refugee population.  And yet we're paying $20,000 for people that will likely come here that are bringing harm to America.  PETE HEGSETH, ""IN THE ARENA"" AUTHOR:  Which is what ISIS has already done that in Europe.  She does it because she's baptized now in the blame America first, politically correct, progressive ideology that says America is part of the problem.  We should all open our borders and be global citizens.  And yet she likes to pretend like she's some type of a hawk, like she's tough so people give her that credit.  No, she's more likely to be an interventionist, but she doesn't have the toughness to back it up.  That's what you see in Libya.  You get all the intervention without the follow-through so you get chaos.  You're going to get politically correct and no gut willingness to win with all this supposed hawkishness.  It's all bad.  HANNITY:  So she was there at the beginning of these Iranian negotiations which gave them all of the money and a ridiculous deal that nobody should have ever negotiated.  She was obviously a part of the Libya failure, the Benghazi failure, the lies associated with Benghazi.  She won't recognize radical Islam for what it is.  I'm trying to understand, why does she says she has these great foreign policy credentials?  HEGSETH:  Because she flew so many miles around the globe, apparently it's the air miles yes.  She also undid the Iraq surge and the victory there and she misspelled the Russian reset button.  Her resume is I was there, I was present, I was secretary of state, but don't look at what happened under my watch.  When Donald Trump is able to litigate what she has done, what Barack Obama has done, it is devastating what they've done to our nation, to our military, to our stature in the world, and he would be wise to keep going at it.  And there's obvious shiny objects like Libya and Benghazi which need to be litigated publicly so people really understand how much they've abandoned our military and abandoned our war fighters.  HANNITY:  Walid, I think it's something that we don't talk enough about.  To think that our brave men and women fought, bled, and died, our national treasure put their lives at risk.  Many didn't come home, many didn't come home with legs or arms that they had when they went there.  And they won Mosul and Fallujah and Tikrit and Ramadi only to have all of those gains that they fought for handed over to ISIS, which George W. Bush, Walid, said was going to happen.  She was a part of that decision-making.  That to me is criminal to ask people to fight and win and then allow their victory to be stolen?  That's insanity to me.  PHARES:  Yes, I can read you very well.  Look, beyond the battlefield achievements of our troops, there were two projects or maybe three projects that the Obama administration had.  One was a partnership with the Muslim Brotherhood.  No matter what the situation is in Egypt, Libya, everything is burning there now.  The second is the Iran deal.  Completely collapsed.  Iran is all over the place.  The third was the restart button in Russia. Russia is in Crimea and in half of Ukraine.  So that is to tell you how successful these strategies worked.  HANNITY:  Yes.  Not very successful.  All right, guys, good to see you both.  Thanks for being with us.PHARES:  Thank you, Sean.HANNITY:  And up next on this special edition of ""Hannity.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment, wants abolish it, abolish it.  (BOOS)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Donald Trump saying Hillary Clinton wants to abolish your right to keep and to bear arms.  Leslie Marshall, Eric Guster, Bo Dietl, they're here with reaction.  That and more on this special edition of ""HANNITY, Trump Takes on Hillary,"" as we continue.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  Welcome back to this special edition of ""Hannity: Trump Takes on Hillary."" 2016 presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump has hammered Hillary Clinton, claiming that she wants to abolish the Second Amendment.  Clearly she does.  Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Hillary Clinton wants to abolish it, believe me.  She wants to abolish our Second Amendment.  Believe me, she'll say I don't want to abolish.  You look at what she wants to do.  She wants to abolish the Second Amendment.  Hillary Clinton wants to reverse the Supreme Court decision D.C. versus Heller upholding the right to keep and bear arms.  Hillary said the Supreme Court is wrong on this Second Amendment.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Now, earlier this week when asked if she agreed that an individual's right to keep and to bear arms is a constitutional right, Hillary had a very hard time giving a straight answer.  Watch this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you believe in an individual's right to bear arms is a constitutional right, that it's not linked to service in the militia?  CLINTON:  I think that for most of our history there was a nuanced reading of the Second Amendment until the decision by the late Justice Scalia, and there was no argument until then that localities and states and the federal government had a right, as we do with every amendment, to impose reasonable regulation.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Now, among her positions on guns, Hillary Clinton supports reinstating the assault weapon ban and tightening what she calls now the gun show and Internet sales loophole.  Joining us now with reaction, FOX News contributor Leslie Marshall, trial attorney, political commentator, Eric Guster, former NYPD detective Bo Dietl.  You're going to agree with me on this, aren't you?  No?  ERIC GUSTER, TRIAL ATTORNEY:  No.  I won't agree with you.  HANNITY:  You do carry a gun.  GUSTER:  I do carry a gun.  Not in New York.  HANNITY:  But where you live, you carry a gun.  GUSTER:  Absolutely.  HANNITY:  I've carried a gun my entire adult life.  Should every American that's law abiding have the right to carry a weapon.  GUSTER:  Yes, with certain provisions.HANNITY:  What provisions.GUSTER:  What Hillary is asking is for certain things such as people's mental issues and other --  HANNITY:  That's not what she said.  You're putting words in her mouth.GUSTER:  No, I'm not.HANNITY:  She gave an answer.GUSTER:  Trump has said she wants to abolish the Second Amendment, and that's not necessarily true.HANNITY:  Listen, if you want to be her spokesman you'd be very good because you just add words she didn't say.  She could not give an answer, Leslie, a specific answer on whether or not she believes that this is a constitutional right for the people to keep and to bear arms.  LESLIE MARSHALL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Sean, I just watched it.  I heard her very clearly state that she feels the Second Amendment is the Second Amendment.  The Second Amendment is for a well-regulated militia, which means that you have regulation.  (CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  George Washington, John Adams, every one of our founding fathers all said the right of the people to keep and to bear arms.  MARSHALL:  I don't see her --(CROSSTALK)MARSHALL:  Do you have your gun?  BO DIETL, FORMER NYPD DETECTIVE:  Yes, I do.  MARSHALL:  President Obama is going to come to take it.  DIETL:  No, he's not going to take my gun.  MARSHALL:  And she's not abolishing the Second Amendment.DIETL:  It's a very clear choice.  It's either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.  She'll say and do whatever she wants to say for one thing.  She's starting to swing towards the left because of Bernie Sanders' group there.  And she's going to go real left on this thing to try to appeal to that segment --  HANNITY:  Hang on a second.  (CROSSTALK)DIETL:  My problem on it, my problem is --(CROSSTALK)DIETL:  The choice is obvious.  You know how --(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  You and I have -- you have a right to carry in New York.  It took me three years to get my carry permit and I had a license to carry in Rhode Island.  DIETL:  Right.  HANNITY:  I had a license to carry in California, Alabama, and Georgia. Three years and 1,000 death threats, and now I have a right to carry.  DIETL:  And the cities with the toughest gun control, Baltimore, Chicago, have the highest murder rates because there's illegal guns with illegal people on the street, people like law-abiding citizens like Eric, you see something --HANNITY:  I have a question for these two liberals here.  I've got a question.  All right, somebody breaks into your house, or anybody's house, what are you going to do?  GUSTER:  I'm going to kill them.  DIETL:  Whoa, whoa.GUSTER:  I believe in rights to protect yourself all day long.  HANNITY:  I know what Leslie's answer is because I did this on the radio with her.  She's going to go into her $5 million safe room.  MARSHALL:  I live in a very -- and this is something I've done my whole life.  I drove a lousy car.  HANNITY:  You have a safe room.  MARSHALL:  I live in a very good neighborhood.  We make sure we are well protected.  HANNITY:  But what about Chicago?  The average person, over Memorial Day weekend, 60 some odd people are shot.  Many are killed.  And the average person in Chicago and New York cannot get a gun, to carry a gun.  MARSHALL:  There are a couple issues.  One, if you look at, and this is something where the Brady campaign and NRA will even agree, 86 percent of the gun dealers in this country are not selling guns used in the commission of a crime.  You're looking at approximately five percent in a sense of --HANNITY:  I bought an Uzi.  I'm a gun collector.  But I had to get a certain thing.  But I can't get that at an average gun store.  MARSHALL:  But Sean we have more gun owners today and we have more mass shootings.  DIETL:  We've got the mass shootings, a few mass shootings, but the majority, the thousands of people that are being killed are being killed by illegal guns in our inner city.  HANNITY:  If we're in San Bernardino, and God forbid what happened there. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims.  Do you hope somebody like Bo Dietl and Sean Hannity are in that room if two people come in shooting?  MARSHALL:  I answered this before.  I sat with Bo.  And I said of course I would feel more comfortable with police or --  HANNITY:  He would save lives.  MARSHALL:  Element of surprise.  We had two armed guards at Columbine.  Columbine still went down.  GUSTER:  We're talking about two different issues.  HANNITY:  No.  We're not.  DIETL:  Guns don't kill people.  People kill people.  HANNITY:  We come back, more on this special edition of ""Hannity"" right after the break.  Please stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  Welcome back to this special edition of ""Hannity: Trump Takes on Hillary."" Unfortunately that is all the time we have left this evening.

3	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/07/20/is-obama-administration-soft-on-islamic-terror/	Is the Obama administration soft on Islamic terror?	"This is a RUSH transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" July 17, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!BOLLING: In the ""Impact Segment"" confronting terror.The Obama administration is famous for refusing to use the term Islamic terrorism.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know, you have the term Islamic terrorism which the President refuses to use, even though there seems to be quite a bit of it. If you look around the world, certainly it's there.If we're going to fight elements that are causing tremendous problems, at least we have to start maybe being not so politically correct.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Does President Obama's failure to define our enemies make it harder to fight them.Joining us from Palm Springs California former U.S. spokesman at the United Nations Rick Grenell; and from Washington Simon Rosenberg, a Democrat strategist.Simon -- isn't the President's political correctness hurting our ability to stop the attacks and thereby causing more American deaths?SIMON ROSENBERG, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: So, first of all, I want to say my condolences to the families of the marines and those who were injured and hats off to the courageous officers down in Chattanooga.And I will tell you why I don't like the term Islamic extremism or however you want to say it is that when you watch a baseball game on TV the announcers don't talk about the baseball players on the field. They talk about them by position -- shortstop, second base, center field.I think we have to use the most precise language possible to describe our adversaries in order to make sure that we have effective strategies to defeat them. There is not just one Islamic terrorist there are different groups.BOLLING: But is that an inaccurate term though -- Simon? Are they not Islamic and are they not terrorists?ROSENBERG: I think we can use more --BOLLING: I think both of those adjectives describe what's going on.ROSENBERG: No, I think we can use more accurate terms. I think we can say ISIS or it can be an Iranian or it can be an American drone. I think there are far more.BOLLING: God forbid you say Iranian terrorists. Then they're going to say all Iranians are terrorists? You know, you're playing little semantic games right here.ROSENBERG: No, I'm not. I'm giving you a true answer which is we should be using the most precise language possible so that we have the best understanding of how to defeat our enemy.BOLLING: All right Rick. What do you say? Is the inability of the Obama administration to call it what it is making it more difficult for us to define it in thereby fight it?RICK GRENELL, FORMER U.S. SPOKESMAN AT THE U.N.: Of course, this isn't baseball. The analogy is ridiculous. I mean come on. We have now moved beyond partisan politics. You look at what's happened happening in Israel the left and right. All our Arab allies, all agree that Obama is weak.What's happening right now is Obama is so weak he is putting pressure on those people who are on the front lines trying to protect us because they have incoming targets at a higher ratio than they have ever had. Obama's weakness is inviting ISIS, which now has a country of at least 10 million people. It's no longer a movement. They have a country.Under Obama they have created a country. That country is attacking us. And we are trying to have a debate. Colonel Peters is right -- this is a war, not a debate. This is not a baseball game. These are our front line protectors that are taking incoming fire at a higher ratio because ISIS smells weakness. We have to defeat them there and here.BOLLING: Simon -- this shooter, this gunman went from one military installation to another, clearly targeting Americans and clearly targeting American military. I don't know why we have a --GRENELL: That's a Islamic radical. Look at who he is. Look at who he is. He is Islamic radical.BOLLING: But Simon you tell us he might not be. Go ahead.ROSENBERG: No, no, no. I did not say that. What I said is that think it's important to distinguish whether he was ISIS and Sunni related or whether he was involved in Shia.BOLLING: Why?GRENELL: They hate Americans. They want to kill us.(CROSSTALK)GRENELL: He is a killer.ROSENBERG: Listen, we didn't -- when there was conflict in Northern Ireland, we didn't describe the two sides fighting there as Christian extremists. We described them as Protestant and Catholic.GRENELL: Some people did, actually. Some people did call them.ROSENBERG: No, no, we used specific terms. We are talking about there is a major element to attack them here.GRENELL: It's not a term issue -- Simon.ROSENBERG: -- the sectarian violence and we need to do a better job as leaders in this country describing to the American people precisely about what's going on.GRENELL: No, I don't care if the killer is playing shortstop or first base. The killer is coming here and trying to get us.ROSENBERG: He didn't come here. He actually was an American -- the person that we are describing in Tennessee was an American citizen.GRENELL: Oh no, he's basically --ROSENBERG: No, no. He was an American citizen who went to high school here. He went to college here. He's homegrown and I think the point is --GRENELL: Let me tell you he is -- he does not represent the American way.ROSENBERG: The point is --GRENELL: His belief came here from a different place. That is not the American way. We will not embrace that.ROSENBERG: I don't think there is any debate about that. I think the point is that I think it's important to understand whether or not he was an Iranian agent who was brought in to the United States versus a homegrown terrorist in order for us to develop strategies to defeat --BOLLING: Hang on, Rick. Give me one second, Rick.GRENELL: You are making a ridiculous argument.BOLLING: Simon, what is offensive about calling a man who killed four innocent marines on their way to work one day -- what's wrong about calling him an Islamic terrorist. They call themselves Islamic. This man prayed at the Islamic center of Chattanooga.ROSENBERG: -- I'm not, all I said was my preference. I don't think - - I'm not offended by the term. I'm saying my preference would be to use more precise language so we can develop better strategies. Your question - -BOLLING: I can't hedge in getting more precise than Islamic terrorist.ROSEBERG: You asked me at the beginning whether or not the way the President was using language was hurting our ability to actually conduct the war against the terrorists.BOLLING: Yes, I have to go. I need to go guys.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: It's a hot topic but I have got to go. Mr. Rosenberg, Grenell -- thank you very much.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.

4	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/03/20/hillary-pundit-problem/	Hillary's pundit problem	"This is a rush transcript from ""MediaBuzz,"" March 20, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.HOWARD KURTZ, HOST: On the ""Buzz Meter"" this Sunday, Donald Trump rolling towards the nomination after another Super Tuesday and the pundits start obsessing on delegate math and whether that might stop him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS: Sir, if you don't buy the contested convention or you could go to a second ballot, third ballot and suddenly the person who brings the party together is not one of those two?NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think it's insane.GLORIA BORGER, CNN: Do you deny the nomination to Donald Trump? I think that's a very difficult case to make at this point.BILL O'REILLY, FOX NEWS: I don't think that Trump will have enough to give him the nomination.HUGH HEWITT, CNN: More than 60% of Republicans don't want him to be their nominee. That's the math. I don't see how he overcomes that when he gets to Cleveland with less than 1,237 delegates.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: But is the contested convention a journalistic fantasy? Is the press making too much of Trump's comments that there might be violence if he's deprived of the prize?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID MUIR, ABC NEWS: Donald Trump fresh off major victories overnight, now warning of riots if the Republicans try to stop him at a contested convention.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: And while he's riding high, why is Trump still picking personal fights with journalists? Marco Rubio drops out. What was it like dealing with reporters during his flameout? We'll ask his husband and wife press team. Another huge week for Hillary Clinton, well news organizations now start ignoring Bernie Sanders and why are some liberal pundits ripping her as a flawed candidate who could lose to Trump. President Obama picks Merrick Garland as his Supreme Court nominee but the GOP senate says no way, no how.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: We chased down the Republican leaders who are refusing to hold hearings or a vote, including Orrin Hatch who once praised Garland.You said before that he belongs on the court, why not at least consider him now?SEN. ORRIN HATCH, R-UTAH: I didn't say that he belongs on the Supreme Court. I said he belonged on the D.C. circuit court.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: Is the coverage painting the Republicans as obstructionists? Plus, a jury hits Gawker with a $115 million verdict for posting a Hulk Hogan sex tape. Will this transform the boundaries of online gossip? I'm Howard Kurtz and this is ""MediaBuzz.""Donald Trump had more huge victories this week winning Florida, knocking Marco Rubio out of the race. But during his victory speech, at Mar-o-Largo, he challenged one of the key pundits and then he said this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)TRUMP: Lies, deceit, viciousness, disgusting reporters, horrible people.(CROWD CHEERING)TRUMP: .some are nice -- some are nice, some really disgusting people back there laughing.(LAUGHTER)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: And during a round of morning show interviews, Trump used the word on CNN that sent the disgusting people of the press to their battle stations.TRUMP: It's we're, you know, 100 short and we're at 1100 and somebody else is at 500 or 400 because we're way ahead of everybody. I don't think you can say that we don't get it automatically. I think it would be -- I think it would have riots. I think it would have riots.KURTZ: And that one word was all it took, riots.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS: It must be really good knowing these people are there and willing to fight for you and stick by you even if you shoot someone on Fifth Avenue. Suggesting lawlessness, even offhand in response to a lawful but unpopular event isn't very presidential.CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC: You don't give me the nomination, but I'll be (ph) the frontrunner, forget the majority. If I'm the frontrunner, you give it to me or I'm going to -- well, it sounds like he would encourage riots.RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC: It's one thing for other people to predict violence or even riots in a politician's campaign, another thing for the candidate himself to promise/threaten that and then not condemn that as a possibility?(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: Joining us now to analyze the campaign coverage Heidi Przybyla, Senior political correspondent for USA Today; Gayle Trotter, a commentator who writes for the Daily Caller and The Hill; and Joe Trippi, Democratic strategist and Fox News contributor.Heidi, I was surprised that the media went to death con one over Trump's, riots con, I mean how do you use that phrase? All of the big riots of the Senate happen and I thought it was hyperbole but now some commentators are saying he was threatening violence.HEIDI PRZYBYLA, USA TODAY: Yes, I had -- well, that's terrible. Because I didn't see the actual comments myself until I went back and read them and honestly I have said something similar earlier in the week that if the race -- in this context, if the race were that close and Trump had just below the number needed to get the delegates and, you know, the Republicans came in and swooped in with some other candidate, there would be mutiny, there would be chaos. I heard Christie spoke (ph) those words, too. But when Donald Trump said it because it came in the context of a week in which there was actual violence going on at his rallies and he is in the spotlight for encouraging violence at his rallies, it took on a life of its own.KURTZ: What do you think, Gayle and also this comes against the backdrop of many in the conservative media just pushing these endless scenarios about what could, should, might happen in Cleveland because they're in the Trump camp.GAYLE TROTTER, COMMENTATOR: Yes. And this is nothing new in politics. You might remember that President Obama in 2009 sat down with American CEOs and told them that his administration was the only thing between him and the pitch fork. So, this is nothing new in politics. And yes the conservative media, the far left and the far right are trying to keep anybody but Trump from getting the nomination. So I think they continue to push this narrative as well.KURTZ: Joe, are the media underplaying the explosion of anger, not necessarily violence, but chaos is a good word that would take place if deals are cut and Donald Trump is denied the nomination if he is close to the magic number?JOE TRIPPI, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely. I mean, absolutely. Look, I've said it. I'll say it clearly. If they do this, it will blow up the party. Now, I wasn't talking about violence.KURTZ: You were talking about T&T and dynamite, yes.(LAUGHTER)TRIPPI: It is a huge mistake to say in all -- and look, regardless of the language he use he spoke the truth. This is one of things about Trump. He speaks something that his followers believe is true and that most of us believe is true which is if they did this, there is going to be chaos and disruption and a lot of anger out there.And in the media response by saying oh, my gosh, how can he say that, which just reinforces him with his supporters and actually -- and actually encouraged more -- his strength on coming primaries.KURTZ: It seems to be a pretty deep split in the coverage Heidi between those who say Trump's got this thing wrapped up and those who say he could definitely be stopped at the convention.PRZYBYLA: I feel like first and foremost, none of us have seen -- a lot of us -- not all of us, but -- not us, have seen a contested convention before. And so there is this not a lot of direction here. But.KURTZ: All the reporters are dying for this to be a knockdown drag out, four days that really matter.PRZYBYLA: Right, but.KURTZ: .some stage coronation.PRZYBYLA: .but I think there's also some overcompensation going on here. Because what you have is the columnists on the right and the left, who've always been very harsh on Trump, but then you have the herd. And the herd was wrong in the beginning. Everybody rode him off.KURTZ: Almost everybody.PRZYBYLA: Almost everybody. Most everybody, okay -- rode him off and was very skeptical about him and then here we are today flash forward and I think there's a lot of overcompensation at this point now to say that you can't deny him what is rightfully his because he's done so well and exceeded our expectations.KURTZ: But speaking of -- I just want to get the sound bite in, Joe and you can respond on those, speaking of the media coverage, here's Ted Cruz complaining about the extent to which day after day after day Donald Trump seems to soak up most of the media attention, let's look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald trump practically goes to the bathroom and it gets carried live on network television. Every speech he gives, he does a press conference that's like watching the shopping channel. He's up there selling steaks and steak knives and wine. The media desperately wants him to be the nominee.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: The media desperately want Donald Trump to be the nominee?TRIPPI: No. I think look if Ted Cruz said things that were interesting that everybody wanted to see, he'd be on a lot more. And Trump does say with regards to whether he agrees with him or not, he says things that people find interesting. And I think that's part of the problem here. The other candidates haven't been able to do that.PRZYBYLA: He makes himself accessible, too.TROTTER: Oh, holy cow, this is a man bites dog story. Because you have Trump who is not a conventional candidate. It's a game. He goes out there and says things that a conventional candidate would never say. The press goes completely wild. And then we have this ability of Donald Trump to use jiu-jitsu to turn all of those negative media to his advantage.KURTZ: Well, if Senator Cruz went on to say the reason the media won in his view Donald Trump being the nominee so they can then turn on him that he could be a weak nominee against Hillary Clinton. Senator Cruz in a recent interview with me said virtually all journalists are partisan Democrats. I don't agree with that when it applies to a lot of reporters, but that's his argument there.TROTTER: The media leans more so. You would have to agree the media.KURTZ: I'm not arguing that for a minute but the idea that we are orchestrating this in a way so that Trump would be the weakest nominee, but he would win, I mean there's a lot more to why he gets all this credit.PRZYBYLA: What's the proliferation in the media that I can't believe the American people are still that gullible to believe that somehow we are this monolith. We've gone from, you know, just a few major news organizations to news organizations like Drudge on the right and Huffington Post on the left, so how can the American people still continue to believe this?TRIPPI: Has there been a nominee, potential nominee that's been as hammered and answered this, you know, pushed off by the media as Donald Trump?KURTZ: No.(CROSSTALK)TRIPPI: That's my point. I mean if, the media had the power to decide things.KURTZ: Yes.TRIPPI: .Donald Trump wouldn't be the frontrunner.KURTZ: One of the bizarre things about this campaign is the negative media attention which Trump's gotten plenty along with some positive. Actually, it helps him in my view. All right, so we saw Donald Trump on Tuesday night talk about disgusting media people that sort of part of a stick (ph), but in recent days, he has renewed his war on Fox News anchor, Megyn Kelly tweeting among other things that she is crazy Megyn Kelly, that she is sick, that her show is unfair, that nobody should watch the show basically calling for a boycott.This prompted a very strong statement from Fox News on Friday night we put up on the screen. Part of it says Donald Trump's victory -- all of his (ph) attacks against Megyn Kelly and his extreme, sick obsession with her is beneath the dignity of a presidential candidate who wants to occupy the highest office in the land.Megyn is an example of a journalist and one of the leading anchors in America. It's especially deplorable for her to be repeatedly abused for just doing her job.Heidi, what do you make of this back-and-forth?PRZYBYLA: Let me just say that in my particular position, I'm a young woman in this industry who is watching Megyn Kelly and women like her and are inspired by her success, so to that extent it's been upsetting and that is why I was motivated to get to the bottom of this.What was it exactly that Megyn Kelly did to invite this latest storm of criticism? And I went back and looked and what I found, check it out people, go online, the tweeting started before Megyn Kelly even went on the air -- the night -- election night, he said, oh Megyn Kelly is on the air. Everybody change their channel.So, this is, you know, part of a pattern of Trump kind of going off of the handle because he clearly continues to watch and sent out these tweets using loaded words like sick and crazy. And the fact -- fact of the matter is Megyn Kelly was giving the same kind of coverage of that -- of those election results, mostly positive that her male counterparts were on virtually every other network and, yet, there was not that kind of response.KURTZ: If Donald Trump wants to say journalist bias, unfair, don't watch his or her show. That's fine, politicians can do that. Journalists are not immune from criticism. But do I think words like sick and crazy are over the top, Gayle.TROTTER: That seems like it's an extreme form of language that he is using. But listening to the back-and-forth between Donald Trump and Megyn Kelly seems like a duet of Carly Simon's song ""You're So Vain."" Because he tells Megyn Kelly, oh, you're average. Your show can't rate and she responds I'm doing just fine without you.So I think that she's been good for the last eight months to not respond very much to his attacks. And I think Fox News coming out and making this statement kind of feeds into his victimization complex. And Fox News, the top people would be better served not to get into it and let Megyn Kelly handle it by herself.(CROSSTALK)PRZYBYLA: But Fox has to defend her, because she is pushing into a new frontier here and this kind of vitriol is not acceptable targeting her. I think they have to come out and she remains her professionalism, you know, maintains her professionalism by not directly responding and getting into the mud.KURTZ: What surprised me Joe is there's been a brief truce. In fact, Donald Trump told reporters and he told me after the debate in Detroit that she had been fair to him. But this does seem to flare up and I asked him, are you obsessing too much about what cable pundits say? He didn't think. He looks at it as saying the record straight does this sort of thing hurt Donald Trump potentially with women?TRIPPI: Absolutely. Look, he's got a huge gender gap. He is running very, very strong with white men but he's got a problem with support among women, Republican women. And I think going after Megyn Kelly doesn't help him. The only explanation I have is he views himself as a ratings bonanza for the networks that's why the coverage of debates has been so high in his mind. Which I think is true. But, so I think he wants to punish Megyn Kelly by trying to drive her ratings lower, to turn the channel.KURTZ: Right.TRIPPI: It's just -- it's not working. And it's doing him damage.KURTZ: Whatever shows Donald Trump appears on, he does choose the ratings but Megyn Kelly still has the second highest rated show in cable news and so his lack of diplomatic relations with her has not hurt the Kelly File.All right, got to get a break, I know you have to say. Ahead, are the media insulting one way on the battle of the President Obama Supreme Court nominee but when we come back, Ashley Parker of ""The New York Times"" uncovering this tenth Trump rally and why she was sometimes scared?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Fighting broke out at a Donald Trump rally in Tucson last night with audience members punching and kicking an anti-Trump protester. Take a look.(CROWD CHEERING)KURTZ: Police later led the protester and the African American man who attacked him out of the arena. Joining us now is Ashley Parker, Correspondent from ""The New York Times,"" who has covered a number of the Trump rallies. So, you write a piece saying that you first felt unsafe at a Trump event a couple of weeks ago in New Orleans, was that unnerving?ASHLEY PARKER, NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER: It was just, you know, covering Trump is not like covering a typical politician. And so at this rally, basically the energy became very sort of tense and very frenetic from the very beginning. And there was -- and there's an almost constant stream of protesters getting marched out and fighting with the crowd and the crowd was turning on them and that's -- you see protesters at other politicians' events.KURTZ: Right.PARKER: .but sort of not at that level and not at that intensity, so it's striking to notice.KURTZ: Was it unnerving for you personally at all?PARKER: Yes. It was a little unnerving personally. And, you know, as a reporter, you're sort of trying to figure out like where do I want to be when this breaks out and how are we going to cover this and what is the best position?KURTZ: You warned your editors, sometime after this someone is going to get seriously hurt at one of these rallies or worse, should you have written that story -- could you have written that story?PARKER: So, we actually -- before Chicago happened, we actually did write a version of that story where we talked about the role of the protesters at Donald Trump rallies and sort of the increasing intensity and just what it's like to be a protester and what it's like to be a member of the crowd. So we didn't sort of know that Chicago was going to happen but we saw things -- we saw things headed that way.KURTZ: All right, so after the Chicago event with the violence breaking out and with the cancellation of that rally, you wrote a piece in the same piece you say that times both sides have behaved badly. But, you say, the Trump supporters you've interviewed have been almost unfailingly courteous. Protesters made the minorities feel wrong, some have instigated the clashes.PARKER: Yes, I mean what you see is -- and I'm -- hopefully in that piece I didn't sort of create a false equivalency. To be clear, there's plenty of protesters who are standing peacefully, silently and they are hauled out. They are pushed there, shoved. But you also see protesters getting carried out and they're shouting and they're, you know, flicking off the crowd and they're screaming and the Trump supporters are screaming. And basically, it's sort of like a mosh pit where tensions are high on both side. And that's where you see the kind of clashes and skirmishes occur.KURTZ: But don't the protesters go there, the ones that are more organized with the purpose of shouting him down or getting the rally cancelled or just being the disruptive force?PARKER: Sure. I think absolutely. I think at the beginning what you saw was just protesters and at a certain point the protesters realized that the way they could sort of reclaim their voice, which is something you hear them speak a lot about, is to come to these events and interrupt them and force them to stop speaking or in the case of Chicago, to shut it down and that sort of their form of social protest.KURTZ: I ask that because a lot of the coverage has focused on Donald Trump and his words and punching in the face as if he's responsible and I'm not letting him off the hook but I just want to underscore the point that some people go there for the express -- purpose of disrupting.So I'm watching television Friday night, there's a Trump rally in Utah and things were seemed like they were going to get tense and I'm thinking there are all these television cameras here and maybe do we give these protesters too much media attention or just the fact this is now a thing, a story, might encourage some people to go and, you know, disrupt the thing and get on television?PARKER: Sure. I mean I think what you're seeing is both from the side of the protesters who know that if he go and disrupt they'll get attention but also from the side of Donald Trump, right? Like protesters have become a part of his rallies. The way talking about, you know, making America great again as part of his rallies. And sometimes if there aren't protesters, you see him say, where are the protesters? Do we have a disruptor, right? So, he kind of egged them on as part of his showmanship in a way he liked them.KURTZ: Which adds to the excitement which of course in turn attracts more television cameras, and then Trump is getting all these air-time. Ashley Parker, great to see you.PARKER: Thanks for having me.KURTZ: Thanks for stopping by this Sunday. Ahead, President Obama in Cuba today, why so little advance coverage of such a controversial trip? But up next, how the media cover candidates who despise each other but suddenly proclaim their mutual admiration when of course it's time for an endorsement.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: First the candidates savage each other then they find a way to hug each other and the media largely report this as this is just business as usual in presidential politics and maybe it is, so what if these guys actually hate each other?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)EMILY TISCH SUSSMAN, COMMENTATOR: I am not surprised that Graham came after Cruz. I've never seen I think it's in a Twitter surge (ph), I've never seen two words used so much together as Cruz and the test.S.E. CUPP, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: Hence, Lindsey Graham's, you know, bizarre marriage now with Ted Cruz.DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS: I actually think that in some ways it felt a little awkward to me watching it because just a couple weeks ago Chris Christie in that last debate said a vote for Trump is a vote for Hillary Clinton.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: Lindsey Graham had a bend over backwards in backing Ted Cruz after once indulging a violent fantasy about his senate colleague.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.: If you kill Ted Cruz on the floor of the senate and the trial is in the senate, nobody could convict you.(LAUHGTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: And where was he equally deadly on the two GOP frontrunners?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GRAHAM: If you're a republican and your choice is Donald Trump and Ted Cruz and the general election is the difference between poison or shot, you're still dead.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Chris Christie spent part of his campaign trashing Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), NEW JERSEY: I just don't think he's suited to be President of the United States.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why?CHRISTIE: I don't think his temperament is suited for that. I don't think he's experienced.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Only to wind up looking rather awkward at a Trump news conference and later sounding a tad defensive.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRISTIE: So, no, I wasn't being held hostage. No, I wasn't sitting up there thinking oh, my God what have I done?(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Ben Carson is also backing Trump despite the billionaire using his life story to liken him to a child molester.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: He said that he's pathological and that he's got basically pathological disease.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: But the doctor hasn't exactly framed his endorsement with surgical precision insisting there were two Donald Trumps including the off-stage cerebral one.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BEN CARSON, FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Even if Donald Trump turns out not to be such a great president, which I don't think the case, I think he's going to surround himself with really good people. But even if he didn't, we're only looking at four years as opposed to multiple generations.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Only four years. And then there was the question that seemed to stump Rick Santorum after he backed Marco Rubio.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's been in the senate for four years, can you name his top accomplishments?RICK SANTORUM, FORMER SENATOR OF PENNSYLVANIA: If you look at being a minority in the United States Senate in a year where nothing got four years or nothing got done, I guess it's hard to say their accomplishments.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Then the media make a great big fuss over endorsements which don't matter much to ordinary voters and the coverage reflects to Washington Post just smile when you take that knife out of your back and support the winner. Hey, he may just give you a job down the road.Coming up, Hillary Clinton cruising to the nomination with some Liberal commentators doubting whether she can beat Donald Trump, and later the husband and wife team who defended Marco Rubio to increasingly skeptical reporters.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Hillary Clinton winning five more states this weekend clearly rolling to the nomination, some people are very excited.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYING)KURTZ: That was Hillary on the comedy sexual show ""Broad City"" but in real life, many pundits still criticizing the former first lady and skeptical of her chances against Donald Trump.We're back with the panel. So, first of all, Heidi, Hillary winning these five states and piling up this huge delegate lead, will the press cut way back on coverage of Bernie Sanders at this point?PRZYBYLA: Well, the bus loads and they were bus loads of reporters following him around, probably go away? Yes. But.KURTZ: So, just being a minivan?(LAUGHTER)PRZYBYLA: .but, they're going to continue to cover him because he's going to play a very important role in unifying the party as she goes rolls closer and closer to the nomination. As we all know, there have been some, you know, rough exchanges between the two. And he's actually not a Democrat.KURTZ: Right.PRZYBYLA: .you know, so I think he feels a little less loyalty necessarily to do the things that the party is going to expect him to do to bring his people over. And so I think they'll continue to cover him very significantly from that per view.KURTZ: In fact, Sanders said the other day he wanted to run as a Democrat to see if he can get more media coverage and running as an independent. So, even President Obama according to the ""New York Times"" privately telling donors this time to unite behind Hillary, even the White House wanted that story out?TROTTER: Yes, they did -- they wouldn't have let it leak if it hadn't been the case and I would disagree with Heidi, I think that they're going to go back on the coverage of Sanders. I think that in this case it's very clear that Hillary has been supported by the media and President Obama has been closer with Hillary than he has been with Bernie previously.KURTZ: That second part is true, but you say Hillary has been supported by the media, what about the thousands of stories about her email and her honesty and.TROTTER: Not enough.KURTZ: .trustworthy?TROTTER: You know, Washington Post had an apologia about her emails two weeks ago basically putting forward the defense of the email scandal, so I think that the media, the leftist media is very much in the tank for her and I think that they will ease back on the coverage of Sanders.KURTZ: I think Hillary Clinton might disagree with that but let me spin this question, you can respond to that too Joe, Liberal pundits, some of them, not terribly excited about his Joe Kline, Time Magazine, a guy who has written sympathetically about the Clinton's for 25 years writing she's our very own quinoa and kale salad, nutritious but bland worse she's the human embodiment of the establishment that Trump has been running against.TRIPPI: Look, I think what's fascinating to me is how the press, they were sparring for a fight on both sides, they kept at Bernie like tremendous oxygen including calling his win in Michigan a historic offset which it wasn't. You now have a proper -- all these candidates are flawed. They all have flaws. And hers have certainly been out there for the world to look at for a long time. But, again, Trump has his flaws, so does Cruz and in the end.KURTZ: So you're not surprised just to button this up, you're not surprised that some commentators on your side, the Liberal side are saying, gee, she can lose this thing in the fall.TRIPPI: No, not at all -- not only that, I'm not one -- I've said, I don't want Trump -- I mean, Trump.KURTZ: Right.TRIPPI: .you know, everybody has underestimated him the entire time on the Republican side why would the Democratic Party underestimate him?KURTZ: Sure.TRIPPI: .and I, you know, I think that's where the coverage is going to go. I think the coverage is going to become increasingly Trump-Hillary not Trump-Sanders.KURTZ: Yes. But let me make this turn because President Obama is in Cuba today, first time in 88 years as the sitting president and I was waiting to see all the advance stories about, you know, this very controversial policy, this very historic trip in there, almost nothing there, they are overshadowed by the campaign shore. Do you think the media just moved on this Cuba question?PRZYBYLA: I don't know if it's so much Cuba as a combination of -- I think there still is a lot of interest in what he's doing and criticism on both sides but I think it's more a function of lame-duckery as well as over coverage of this -- having two contestants.KURTZ: Right.PRZYBYLA: .primary battles on both the Republican and Democratic side, so it's also a function of just resources like.KURTZ: Could it also be, Gayle that many journalists privately agree that after a 50-year boycott it was time to recognize the Castro regime, so they don't think it's controversial?TROTTER: I would agree with that. The press privately agrees with the Obama administration's policy on this. So you're not seeing the reportage of the human rights violations in Cuba. You can kind of compare it to the Iran deal. There's a lot more coverage of the Iran deal and it's a very similar strategy in foreign policy that President Obama has with regard to Cuba but there's a lot more coverage of the Iran deal and the human rights violations from like the 2009 Green Revolution.TRIPPI: The political -- the politics of the day are what drives coverage. And there just isn't that much controversy even on the political side.KURTZ: Is that.(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: .because, you know, one poll I looked at YouGov 51% supporting the President's visit, 55% supporting diplomatic relations with Cuba.TRIPPI: That's exactly right. And so, you don't see Republicans really using that as the wedges, you know, this election has happened in the past. I'm not saying it isn't one, I'm just saying it's just not as intense and there's no reason for the press to cover it from that perspective.KURTZ: There's no reason the press to cover it when we can always do another story about Donald Trump, right?(LAUGHTER)KURTZ: We always just touch on the story of the day that was a very big story at that time, but now maybe the country has moved on. By the way, President Obama will be interviewed in Cuba by ABC, Anchor David Muir so they've lined up the media coverage there. Joe Trippi, Gayle Trotter, Heidi Przybyla, great to see you all this Sunday.After the break, President Obama tries to pressure the senate into voting by picking Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court. Does the coverage reflect the hypocrisy on both sides? And later, with Hulk Hogan's legal victory, can Gawker survive a $115 million verdict?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: The Republicans had already warned President Obama not to send up a nominee to replace the late Antonin Scalia. But this week, the President chose veteran judge, Merrick Garland for the high court and the media story line was clear, would he even get a hearing?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TERRY MORAN, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: In Merrick Garland, the President has chosen nominee who has had support from both sides the political aisle over the years who in any normal time would be confirmed. It's not a normal time.MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT: This is a political gamble. Republicans want to appear strong but not obstructionists which can ultimately backfire to the benefit of Democrats.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Joining us now in New York, Tamara Holder, an attorney who hosts the Online Fox Show Sports Court and a Fox News Contributor, Guy Benson political editor at Town Hall here in Washington, also a Fox News Contributor.Guy does the coverage have bestowed (ph) President Obama picked a moderate, a centurist (ph) Merrick Garland, a guy who prosecuted the Oklahoma Shooting Bombing case, but Republicans won't even dame (ph) to give him a hearing.GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It does. Although the thing Howard that strikes me most about the coverage of this story is how muted it is compared to what I think it normally would be in a political cycle like this. I think in any presidential campaign perhaps except for this one, a Supreme Court vacancy and an appointment by the President by a lame-duck president or whoever would be a blockbuster.KURTZ: It would dominate.BENSON: .it would dominate, but it's not -- it's like a second or third level story because of the Trump factor certainly and also I think the timing with the NCAA tournament, Americans just aren't tuning into this the way they might in a normal circumstance.KURTZ: Wow, blown up by march-man (ph). Tamara, do you see much of this tone in the coverage? Democrats and Republicans are both hypocritical on this question they've constantly changed their positions depending on which party controls the White House.TAMARA HOLDER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I just want to point out Guy's position that this is muted. It's far from muted. What's going on here, if you compare the Bork nomination July 1st of 1963, the coverage was all about Bork and whether he was too far right, his position on abortion, his position on Watergate and now what we're seeing with the media is strictly a political issue, a political tug of war.Everybody is fighting over the football. You have the broncos and the patriots. You don't even realize that the football is deflated or not. That's what's going on here and it's really unfortunate because the words that the media is using are war, battle and this is not a political issue. The constitution specifically says that the President shall nominate and the President shall confirm. This isn't about going to war. I don't see any second amendment issues in here.KURTZ: Guy?BENSON: That's actually now what the constitution says, it says that the senate has the advice and consent role which can include under the constitution refraining or declining to confirm the nominee and to withhold that consent. But that's the political angle on this. I think you misunderstand, Tamara, my point about the muted coverage. I'm not saying that the language doesn't get punched up occasionally. Of course it does, it's a sensationalized media environment. I'm arguing that compared to what this story would be from a political standpoint, the degree to which it would be covered as a bombshell story is less so in this cycle than it otherwise might be.KURTZ: Tamara, let me jump in here and ask you, wouldn't the coverage look very different if Republicans had waited, Merrick Garland got nominated and then they came out with whatever they don't like about his record, second amendment you name it, as opposed to Mitch McConnell company declaring in advance that anybody that President Obama sign up would not even get so much as a hearing?HOLDER: Well, I think that it's -- the media has been derelict on their duties on both sides. You have -- you have NPR for example, a few hours ago, they covered it as what Barack (ph) have -- one of his phone calls to his supporters was that because the senate -- the Republicans won the senate that now Obama doesn't basically have any rights. Like forget that we even have a President. And instead of the media covering it as an issue as to what it is, the face value issue, they're covering this political war of the, you know, the shirts and the skin.(LAUGHTER)KURTZ: Let me read you Guy a news story lead from ""Politico,"" senate Democrats are preparing a national pressure campaign and the blunting Republicans stubborn opposition to Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court, any thoughts on that and again this question I raise where we have videotape comments from Republicans in the past saying there should be a vote whether Republicans is in the White House and from Democrats in the past.BENSON: Yes.KURTZ: .saying there shouldn't be a vote when a Republican is in the White House.BENSON: So, there is just hackery (ph) and partisanship on both sides on this issue. It's the ultimate partisan fight a lot of the time. I think that there will be a different tone with a Republican in the office. I think we'd be hearing a lot more about.HOLDER: Wait. What's the hackery (ph) on the left? I don't understand. With all due respect, I don't understand what the hackery (ph)on the left is that we have a sitting President who nominated and did his job where.BENSON: Okay. I -- I appreciate -- I appreciate.HOLDER: .a guy that the people on the right have previously supported by the way.KURTZ: Right.BENSON: I appreciate the interruption and I will answer your question regardless which is the hackery on the left is Joe Biden making every single Republican point that they're currently making back in 1992. Chuck Schumer, Harry Reid doing the same thing during the Bush administration, Barack Obama in the senate, filibustering Sam Alito. There are plenty of double standards here. There is your answer to that.KURTZ: And Mitch McConnell the same thing.BENSON: Right.KURTZ: Tamara, you've got about a half minute to respond.HOLDER: Whatever happened in the past, that's like if you wanted me right now to blame Bush for all of this. I'm not go there.BENSON: No.HOLDER: Would this is an issue not about '92 and Biden, this is an issue about the fact that we have a President and I don't particularly care if he is a president who is a Republican or a Democrat, he is a sitting president.KURTZ: Tamara.HOLDER: .and he has the job to, you know, appoint and nominate or nominate somebody for the Supreme Court who both sides previously liked.KURTZ: All right, Tamara.HOLDER: And that's what the media, your question was the media should cover it that way.KURTZ: One sentence answer, are you disappointed in the media coverage of the Supreme Court nomination?HOLDER: I disappointed?KURTZ: Yes.HOLDER: I always disappoint.(LAUGHTER)KURTZ: All right. So, then you have more reason to be disappointed because it's a typical Washington issue, where will be always debates when it looks like the Republicans are not going to budge. Great to see you both, Tamara Holder and Guy Benson, here in Washington.Next on ""MediaBuzz,"" Alex Conant and Caitlin Conant on defending Marco Rubio as the media soured on the senator and later why NBC pulled the plug on a former Obama operative?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: In the final weeks of Marco Rubio's campaign as reporters constantly demanded to know whether the senator was dropping out, his press team faced the unamiable task of rebutting the rumors.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ALEX CONANT, FMR RUBIO CAMPAIGN COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: In Florida specifically there's only one candidate in Florida that can beat Donald Trump and that's Marco Rubio.UNIDENTIFED FEMALE: Before Marco Rubio was leading that extensively and now Trump has picked up the pace after.CONANT: Yes.UNIDENTIFED FEMALE: .after this past weekend, so how do you reason that?CONANT: Well, the truth is that the polls have been all over the place.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Joining us now are Alex Conant, Rubio's Former Communications Director and his wife, Caitlin Conant also a member of the communication stash. So, Caitlin wasn't it hard as the losses piled up and the polls started sinking in Florida to maintain an optimistic tone?CAITLIN CONANT, FMR RUBIO CAMPAIGN SURROGATE COMM. DIR: Look, it was very, very fun working at the press. We have a good relationship with the media and we are obviously in the media relations business. So, you know, it's always a give and take but it was very hard.KURTZ: Another question was why is he doing so badly and is he going to drop out, and aren't you concerned about this poll or that poll?CONANT: Yes, and it was definitely difficult with some of our surrogates too. Look, part of my job is making sure that we had our top two surrogates at debate to talk about substance and how Marco did the debate and Cory Gardner -- Senator Cory Gardner was a trooper.And he was there in Michigan after one of the debates and he just kept getting asked, you know, what it's going to be if Trump the nominee, will you support Trump.KURTZ: Yes.CONANT: .and then the story written, look they asked him seven times, so it was hard to break above the fray and stay optimistic going into the end but we worked for Marco, I came over for Marco because we believe in him so we are hopeful.KURTZ: Not doubting that. Alex, you had to insist or deflect whether Rubio would continue if he lost Florida, you had to know that if he lost Florida he'd be toast?CONANT: Well, I didn't know I mean, I -- to be honest with you, I think Marco made that decision in the hours leading up to the polls closing.KURTZ: Right.CONANT: .I mean we honestly believed that there was a shot that we would win Florida, obviously, it didn't worked out that way it was a -- it was a very strange year. And to be honest, Howie I think that the negative drumbeat in the media was really damaging to the campaign especially after the Super Tuesday losses, all everyone heard about was how Marco was losing and just the Trump force, that only you can (ph) underestimate them.KURTZ: So, do you think that that negative drumbeat was unfair, overplayed, because after all it began with -- when your campaign was hitting a lot of rough patches and there was bad news.CONANT: Yes, I mean -- I think it was unfair in retrospect was that Donald Trump got about 20 times as much media as the rest of the candidates campaigned. The day of the Florida -- of the Florida Primary, there was a report that there has been $2 billion worth of free media surrounding Donald Trump's campaign.KURTZ: Right.CONANT: .which is more than any other campaign in history and we're not even into the general election yet so I think that, you know, I think that the media, you know, has to look at that.KURTZ: But almost until the end a lot of your rivals certainly believed that Senator Rubio who was on the cover of Time, The Republican Savoir, was a media darling and was getting a lot of positive press.CONANT: Yes, but all of the questions ended up being about Trump towards the end. And a prime example we did a ton of national TV leading up to it but it turned in almost an advertisement for Trump every time he went on, so by the end.KURTZ: And that was frustrating?CONANT: It was frustrating and by the end, we started doing a bunch of regional satellite tours and -- but even there was the local press, regional press it was all Trump, Trump, Trump so Marco was obviously a very excellent communicator and he did his best to trying.KURTZ: Yes.CONANT: .rise above the fray.KURTZ: Well, speaking of Trump, by the way, it's funny when you run over the CNN bureau to go on air and rebut report that there was an internal debate about why did senator drop out, you had to defend Marco Rubio, your boss, when he started -- he went through that spade of insulting Donald Trump over a small hands, spray tan, wetting his pants until he admitted it was a mistake.CONANT: Yes, well I mean look, I think you mentioned I didn't go over the CNN, I think CNN found their missing airplane with Donald Trump. I mean Donald Trump was the equivalent of a missing airplane for CNNs ratings and that's all they talked about, that's all that they reported at and so in order to break in to some of that coverage, you know, Marco started engaging Trump in ways that he later regretted.KURTZ: Just briefly, you guys working around the clock, sometimes travelling together, a little bit strain on the marriage?CONANT: It was so much fun.KURTZ: Fun.CONANT: We've done this before. We've worked for 10 polls (ph) together and.CONANT: Johnny Aarons (ph).CONANT: Johnny Aarons (ph), you know, different roles.KURTZ: Okay.CONANT: .but some people think it's crazy, we do it together but we think it would be crazy not to because we pour everything into these jobs, we got very passionate. We both believed in Marco a lot.KURTZ: There is the sound bite, some people think it's crazy but we're not crazy. Alex Conant and Caitlin Conant, thank you for stopping by this Sunday.Still to come, what happened when NBC briefly hired a former Obama operative and Hulk Hogan's legal victory over Gawker in that sex tape case, why that style journalism could become extinct?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: NBC and MSNBC have just confirmed that Stephanie Cutter, a former top campaign aide to President Obama, had been hired as an analyst. But there was a big, fat conflict, the White House they just announced that Cutter wouldn't be part of a group of ex-officials working to confirm the Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. A major story for NBC to cover, in the blink of an eye, the network told the Washington Post that Cutter was now just be on as a guest not an paid analyst, really the only decision possible.It was to be sure a salacious case, Hulk Hogan suing the gossip site Gawker for posting a tape of him having sex with the wife of a close friend, radio host, Bubba the Love Sponge with Bubba's encouragement. And it ended Friday with a devastating blow a $115 million verdict against Gawker. Sure it was hard to feel sorry for Hulk who had talked up the sex escapade with Howard Stern and others, but the trial did turn on journalistic standards.Hogan's team now boasting a public disgust with the invasion of privacy being disguised as journalism. It was cringeworthy when a Gawker editor said this was constitutionally protected speech simply because it was a celebrity having sex and that Gawker would draw the line, this was said sarcastically at a 4-year-old having sex.So, was this news or exploiting and embarrassing a famous person just for the sake of clicks? Gawker says key evidence was excluded and it will appeal. But if the huge damages are upheld it could put the site out of business and redefine the boundaries of what's acceptable in online journalism.Story we'll continue to follow.That's it for this edition of ""MediaBuzz.""
