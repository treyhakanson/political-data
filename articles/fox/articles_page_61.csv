This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Greg Gutfeld, along with Andrea Tantaros, Bob Beckel, Eric Bolling, and snow angels make replicas of her, it's Dana Perino.This is ""The Five.""(MUSIC)GUTFELD: The show ""House of Cards,"" aka, the Olympics for homely people, premiered this weekend. Power corrupts but so does attention and Hollywood knows there's nothing that makes the media more pliable than when you include them in the fun, which is why Kevin Spacey showed up on ""This Week"" saying this:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS: Is Washington more exciting than Hollywood?KEVIN SPACEY, ACTOR: Look, for me, it's like performance art.(LAUGHTER)You know, I sometimes watch and actually we can get done shooting in a day and I'll come home and turn on the news and I'll think, you know, our storylines are not that crazy. They're really not.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Well, maybe so, but with one exception: When it comes to the right, they get it all wrong. But so does all of TV.By applying a lefty aesthetic to the right, the Hollywood version of conservatism becomes as real as Spacey's hair.The right doesn't act the way the left thinks, but the writers don't know that, because they don't know righties. In ""House of Cards,"" you have angry right wingers protesting a politician's wife's abortion. And in another show, ""Nashville,"" a singer cancels concerts due to Christians who are mad that she broke up a marriage.This is all B.S.Right wingers' first instinct is never to protest but to go to work. It's the left that would rather picket than produce. Can you remember the last protest over personal behavior by the right? Did they even bother with Bill Clinton?This is why hate crime hoaxes are so obvious. Nooses on doorknobs, slurs on diner receipts, it's always blamed on the right. But only the libs are that dramatic.It was lefties who stormed the Texas legislature. It's Code Pink who heckles. Conservatives don't wake you up to discuss pipelines at your door step. They don't write stuff on walls. They don't scream at passing cars. In fact, the worst thing they do, sadly, is nothing.So, Andrea, you haven't watched the show because you're very busy. Or is it because it reminds you of your old job?ANDREA TANTAROS, CO-HOST: It does a little bit. Sometimes when it's too close to home, I think Dana said it was like doctors might not watch medical shows because it reminds them too much of maybe their past life or their past job. But it is a pretty predictable plotline to go after conservatives. I do watch ""The Following"" on FOX with Kevin Bacon.And, for example, of course, the crazy cult couldn't just be a crazy cult. It had to be a militia that was obsessed with guns. So, I think it would be really refreshing if these shows for once didn't take a shot at conservatives and took a shot at liberals, or maybe portrayed things accurately. That would be refreshing and that would be different.But the thing is we watch anyway, even conservatives anyway. And I think --GUTFELD: Because we're used to it.TANTAROS: Yes, we're used to it, and we can see through the B.S., and I do think it's probably the toughest reason conservatism can't break through, is because culturally, we're just being bomb parted with these messages everywhere from TV to music. It's not just Washington, D.C.GUTFELD: Yes.Bob, the show is based on the idea there's this vice president who is actually pulling all the strings and the president is ineffectual. Could this be true with Joe Biden and Barack Obama?(LAUGHTER)BOB BECKEL, CO-HOST: I certainly hope not.GUTFELD: Who knows? Joe Biden could be an Oscar-winning actor pretending to be a bumbling idiot.BECKEL: Well, he's not a bumbling idiot. We edit him that way. But I think Joe's had his distinguished career.But I'll tell you this about ""House of Cards."" I thought that the first -- I didn't watch it until Dana forced me to do it. So, I sat and I start to watch it and watched the whole first season.As somebody who has been in Washington 30 years, it was a pretty accurate portrayal of at least the legislative process. I won't say that too about some of the -- this one guy getting killed in a garage. But the rest of it, I thought, was pretty much on the money. And I'll tell you a story -- well, let Dana go because I'll follow it up and tell you why the second episode turns out to be true.GUTFELD: Let me go to Eric. I know you don't watch the show because there are no zombies in it. If the president was a zombie, would you watch it?ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Can I be honest? I pushed back. Dana said, you have to see it, you have to watch it. So, when we're doing the segment, they sent me two episodes. I believe it's the last episode of season one and the first episode of season two. Fantastic.TANTAROS: I know you'd love it.BOLLING: I didn't want to like it. I'm absolutely hooked on it. I love it because of the interaction.Now, as for it being accurate, I mean, the vice president was involved in a -- he actually killed one of his enemies, maybe it's not as accurate as we're saying, but Kevin Spacey's hair is fake?GUTFELD: I'm pretty certain it is. I'm assuming it is.BOLLING: Can I be honest? The interaction between Spacey and his chief of staff is just phenomenal. I love the show now.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: That's what I loved about it at first, too.GUTFELD: Yes. Your impressions have changed, Dana?PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: You're now moving away from the show.PERINO: I had very high expectations and they have been dashed. I was a big fan early on. One of the things that is accurate about it, the set design. Some of the lighting -- I think that in the Oval Office, it looks just like, at least before president and Mrs. Obama redid the current Oval Office, it looks like the one during President Bush's time. Same couches, same chairs.I like some of the legislative action, too. I think that the way a bill becomes a law, look, it's kind of boring, so you have to do it quick if you're going to do it in a 45-minute episode.What I didn't like in this season compared to last season is last year, I felt like it was the first show I watched where the Democrats weren't portrayed as complete angels. Everybody looked bad but you could work together to get something done. That actually happens here on an important issue, entitlement reform, expect there's so much portraying of a Tea Party candidate or congressman, as a doofus.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: And it's also so thinly veiled, all the little messages about how Democrats are better than Republicans. I was really disappointed in the show. But I'm going to watch it, but I was disappointed.BECKEL: Without giving anything away about that, when they did the vote and they didn't have a majority, the quorum, they sent out a word to sergeant and arms to haul people in handcuffs to the floor. You know, that's actually happened.In 1988, Bob Packwood was hiding, he didn't want come for a quorum call, he was hiding in the Senate, hidden office underneath the bowels of Capitol Hill, these little offices, and they had to break down his door. They brought him in, feet first, onto the floor of the Senate, and he became the quorum. And then they could go ahead and vote what they want to get through.And the other thing is was they brought a guy, Bellman (ph), who was dying of cancer, I remember this. We need his vote desperately on the Panama Canal treaties and they brought him in on a stretcher. And someone said, ""How do you vote?"" And somebody put his arm up and said, aye, we got to vote.TANTAROS: Like weekend at Bernie's.GUTFELD: Yes.TANTAROS: Real quick. It seems like they learned from the mistakes of the ""West Wing,"" Dana, to your point about lighting, because remember how dark it was on the ""West Wing""? It was like that show ""Felicity,"" there was no lights -- I mean, no one could see anything.But it sounds like they're playing into suspicions. People suspected or trying to say that Dick Cheney was running the presidency, and people have said, oh, yes, the Clintons have killed people. So I think they start to play into these suspicions with the show.PERINO: It's the same with ""Nashville"" -- you mentioned in your monologue, one of the characters, this big iconic star, she has an affair with a married man. That marriage breaks up and all of a sudden, her country concerts are canceled all over the nation, and there's crazy protesters whenever she goes. I don't remember the last time somebody protested about infidelity, and it's all right winger, Bible thumpers that are characterized in a show called ""Nashville,"" about country music. It's their fans. It kind of soured me on that show a little bit, too.GUTFELD: You're falling apart --PERINO: It looks like I have been crying, but I actually have a cold.GUTFELD: Well, Eric, let me ask you this -- President Obama tweeted about the fact he was going to watch a bunch of shows this weekend. He said, please, no spoilers.So, what is the philosophy behind --PERINO: Because he's checking Twitter all the time? Give me a break.GUTFELD: What is the -- what is the rules with spoilers now that things are being released all at once? A season is released, is it up to you not to tell people? Is that your responsibility?BOLLING: No, there's a spoiler alert app you can get on Twitter. You put the word in, and anytime it appears, it won't show up on your Twitter feed. But maybe that's what happened with Benghazi, the IRS, Fast and Furious. Don't tell --PERINO: Don't tell me how it ends.BOLLING: Yes, I'll find out later.Can I point out something about ""Walking Dead"" my favorite show, they took another anchor, host from another network, and put him on talking dead afterwards last night. I was crushed. I was absolutely floored. There couldn't have been a more positive influence for ""Walking Dead"" than this one right here. It killed me --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: I kept on you to watch ""House of Cards,"" and you finally did it today. I'm going to commit to you. I will watch an episode of ""Walking Dead.""BOLLING: You do ""Walking Dead,"" I'll do ""House of Cards.""PERINO: All right. Let's check it out.GUTFELD: There's some German art films I would like to introduce --(LAUGHTER)TANTAROS: I tried to watch those, but I was moved to tears.GUTFELD: I can't watch them because they remind me of certain things in my past.TANTAROS: That was you in the film, right?BECKEL: You probably did a lot of German films.GUTFELD: It's hard to tell it's me with all the latex.TANTAROS: It was (INAUDIBLE).GUTFELD: Yes, I'm going to throw to one more. This is the SOT of -- sound on tape -- of Stephanopoulos, is that his name? The guy with hair. Stephanopoulos, stephenvelope (ph), whatever. Talking to Spacey about the pace of government versus what President Obama can do, I guess.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEPHANOPOULOS: It does seem like even President Obama has a little bit of Frank Underwood envy, the ruthlessly efficient Frank Underwood.SPACEY: I can imagine he would. It must be really interesting not just for an American public, but people around the world to view a very effective Congress that gets things done. So, I can imagine he must feel, gosh, I wish we could move that quickly.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Andrea, what do you think of that?TANTAROS: That was another dig, I think, at Republicans, wishing he could get something done quicker. The Founding Fathers didn't set up the government so things could fly through. They wanted the gridlock, they wanted things to be debated, they want the push-pull, and the tug of war. And I'm sure President Obama does think that he is a shrewd, savvy character.The reality is, it was really Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid who pushed through that agenda, who got ObamaCare through. President Obama is not shrewd and does not know how to navigate.BECKEL: Well, I wouldn't say he's not shrewd. Anyone who gets elected to president of the United States is probably shrewd.TANTAROS: To the political process.BECKEL: What you're saying about President Obama, if he could be Frank Underwood, sure, he would be. But to be a Frank Underwood, the last time the Congress was run like that is when Lyndon Johnson was majority leader and Sam Rayburn was speaker of the House, both from Texas.And those guys would come together and decide how the government is going to run, and it got done.PERINO: Don't you think Gingrich was like that too, though?BECKEL: I don't think he has much power as Rayburn did, no.GUTFELD: Rayburn was a match game, right?(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: I don't.BECKEL: You don't remember Sam Rayburn, do you?GUTFELD: I watched the entire season, and I don't -- it makes me feel awful that you sit and you watch 13 episodes in a row in your underwear.PERINO: How do you purge yourself after binging on television?GUTFELD: There are photos.PERINO: You got to go for a run.GUTFELD: Candy Crowley is on, though, and starts asking really tough questions. I thought, how refreshing to see her -- yes, she's on. I won't say what she's talking about because then that's a spoiler alert.All right. Ahead, how to defeat Hillary Clinton if she runs again in 2016? Mitt Romney and Karl Rove have some ideas.Plus, our picks for the greatest U.S. president of all time on this Presidents' Day.Back in a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: If Hillary Clinton runs for the White House again and clinches the nomination, what's the best strategy for Republicans to defeat her? Senator Rand Paul thinks her husband's infidelity scandal should be revisited, but Mitt Romney doesn't agree.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MITT ROMNEY (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think Hillary Clinton, if she becomes the nominee, will have plenty to discuss about her own record. I don't imagine that Bill Clinton is going to be a big part of it. On the other hand, he embarrassed the nation. He breached his responsibility, I think, as an adult and as a leader in his relationship. And I think that's very unfortunately, but I don't think that's Hillary Clinton's to explain.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Karl Rove also has some thoughts on how to defeat her.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Anybody who is going to take on Hillary Clinton in 2016 if she is the Democratic candidate or if she does run, Democratic or Republican, had better focus on what they're for in a way that allows them to contrast implicitly with Mrs. Clinton. For Democratic or Republican, easier to say what you're against, harder to say what you're for, and more important to say what you're for.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: OK. So, let's start with Eric.Everyone is saying don't talk about the elephant in the room. Right, the media is saying Republicans, we're warning you. Don't know there. Don't talk about it.GUTFELD: Why do you have to talk about her weight? That's so offensive. Apologize immediately, Dana.PERINO: It's a saying. It's a phrase -- the elephant in the room.GUTFELD: Oh, I didn't know.PERINO: Now, I'm totally thrown off. Anyway, my question is, is it legitimate to bring it up?BOLLING: I'm not sure it's legitimate to bring out Bill -- if you're talking about her response to Bill's dalliances or whatever was going on --PERINO: Or the fact that he'd be back in the White House.BOLLING: I don't know that's reliable.BECKEL: Dalliance?PERINO: It's a delicate word.BOLLING: OK. All right. So, his affairs that he was having, you know, whatever, but it's relevant to look at Hillary Clinton to see how she reacted then in the papers that were released about a month ago or a couple weeks ago.We found out that she knew about them and she kind of excused them because they called her ruthless because she was really focused on Bill Clinton's presidency and maybe her own going down the road. You have to decide, is that the kind of person you want? Someone so driven and so focused that they'll look the other way on some of the things that maybe important to other people.I think it's relevant in those terms. I don't think it's relevant that Bill Clinton slept with a bunch of women while he was in the White House.PERINO: The report you're talking about was in the ""Washington Free Beacon,"" Andrea, and it was a reporter, Alana Goodman, who went after the papers. Finally, they were released by the Clinton Library.But then the media, instead of talking about the substance of the documents, decided to attack the ""Washington Free Beacon"" as being an illegitimate news source, even though she had gotten the scoop that all of them would have loved to have for themselves.TANTAROS: And that's exactly what they'll do to anyone who tries to attack Hillary Clinton based on facts or based on the issues. They'll say, ""You don't like women."" They're going to try everything just to not keep this about her record when she was a senator in New York.I think the worse thing a Republican can do is talk about Bill and his affairs, especially most people in the United States knew he was an adulterous horn dog before he got elected and he won a majority of women. So, women proved that they really don't care about that. And she will say, I'm a victim, if you bring it up.What they should be doing now is asking her real questions -- what's your plan to create jobs? Are you for an employer mandate? Would you have delayed it? I mean, substantive questions about what she would do as president? Instead of just, she's a woman, rah-rah, it's her turn, we should vote for her, and we get Bill as well.PERINO: Even in 1999 and 2000, when George W. Bush was running in the primary and then in the general election, Bob, they made a political decision or a communications decision or he just decided he wasn't going to talk about it, but would focus on an agenda. Do you think -- I mean, he ended up winning, a good strategy for 2014 and 2016?BECKEL: Let me just look at this as a pure political analyst. I'm going to disagree with Mitt Romney. The idea that Bill Clinton will not be involved some way in the discussion about a Hillary candidacy is ludicrous. It's going to happen.I don't think -- I think he's exactly right, you don't want to go after them on the affairs. That's been gone over and over again. I don't think that's where they're going to go. They're going to use Clinton's success economically as part of the strategy.The other thing is -- I agree with Rove. You can't go after Hillary Clinton, why didn't you do this, why didn't you do this?Republicans have got to learn here. Sooner than later, that they're going to have to have a strategy that says here's what we're for and this is how we're going to do it and very explicit about. They've sort of talked about it, we have the strategy in the (INAUDIBLE) -- but you need to be able to put up a positive -- this is what you do, this is how I do it, instead of saying no, no, no.TANTAROS: I agree with that, but don't you think they should ask her what she plans on doing instead of talking about what her husband did, instead of talking about her appearance, instead of talking about her weight? I mean, they should leave all of that and ask her, OK, here's what we're going to do, what are you going to do?BECKEL: Well, listen, if ObamaCare goes as badly as you think it is, I don't think it is, but if does, they're going to raise that issue on her because of the health care reform debate began really with her heading up the health care reform panel at the White House.But I think you're exactly right about this. You're going to have to force her to say, this is what I would do. But at the same time, she's going to have to force Republicans to say, OK, what is your answer? For the last four years, you've all said nothing, absolutely nothing.GUTFELD: I just think that you should be able to ask Hillary what is she going to do, and ask Bill, who are you going to do? Sorry, go ahead.PERINO: All those questions, five Ws and an H.Unfair for Romney to say that Clinton embarrassed the nation or accurate?GUTFELD: I guess it's fair. But I guess it doesn't matter at this point. How many people are voting right now that are going to vote --PERINO: Many people are voting that had no idea it ever happened?GUTFELD: Yes, what's her face (ph).Miley Cyrus was in England and did a theatrical performance where she simulated a sex act with President Clinton. I don't think anybody in the audience even understood what was going on up there because they were 4 years old when it happened.Going back to what you're saying, we're all in agreement that it's not about the negative approach to Hillary. It's the positive approach of the Republican Party.The person cannot just be right about the issues. They have to be persuasively, meaning they have to be able to convince people, if you're not political, that you like this person, which President Obama was able to do. He convinced non-liberals, young people, to vote for him without really understanding what his ideology was.BOLLING: Can I throw something in here, too? I agree with you, Bob, the Republicans have to say, this is what we're about, this is how we're going to fix the economy, this is how we don't like ObamaCare.But if you want to go after her, look, there's no disputing that when those four bodies came back from Benghazi, I know everyone hates Benghazi, they're sitting in the hangar, and she mentioned the video at that point as part of the blame for why those guys are dead, those guys in the screen right there, and knowing very well at that moment in time it had absolutely nothing to do with the video.If you want to do something, there's your negative attack ad right there.PERINO: Are they going to have to address that, Bob? I mean, she sort of feels -- I think Hillary Clinton thought she has put it to bed, but do you think it comes back out to haunt them?BECKEL: Well, I'm sure the right is going to bring that back up. But anybody who is going to vote against her on Benghazi is already voting against her. In other words, you've got hard core conservatives who think about Benghazi a lot are going to vote against her anyway. So, that's really not a workable issue as far as I'm concern.PERINO: You don't think it's a matter of character and judgment?BECKEL: Well, you could argue that, but listen, this is a woman who has persevered through an awful lot. She's been first lady, she's been an United States senator, she's been secretary of state. The people in the military like her.But let's hear the other big obstacle for the Republicans. You've got a majority of voters in the country are women. There's going to be 4 percent or 5 percent of women who are going to vote, who would otherwise vote Republican, who will vote for a woman. So, that makes it that much bigger to climb.GUTFELD: That's why they need -- I mean, I said they need an Obama. They also need a Hillary. They need an Obam-illary, a black woman.TANTAROS: Yes, because you could imagine eight or nine white guys and it's going to be a coronation likely for her, and I think that's when the report came out in the ""Free Beacon"" saying that she was ambitious and people go, my God, she's ambitious -- I think that if that's the attack they use, they're going to say, they're going to rally women by saying what's wrong with a female being ambitious?PERINO: Definitely.TANTAROS: And they're going to pit women against men, and women are going to say, we want to see a woman in the White House. We want to be a part of history, the same way they want to be a history with Obama.BECKEL: And ambitious, by the way, nobody gets to be president of the United States --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: It wasn't just ambition. The word was ruthless. I think that was the other word.BECKEL: There's a lot of ruthlessness --PERINO: I agree. I don't think that that's necessarily bad.OK. Coming up, a warning from our secretary of state about a threat to the world that is greater than terrorism, but not everyone is buying it. That's up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Folks, it's cold outside. In fact, last week, 49 of the 50 states -- or 57 if you're President Obama -- had snow on the ground.Record snowfall and extreme temperatures in Japan, I can go on and on. For the last 17 years, there is no, literally, no measurable warming of the globe.But our Secretary of State John F. Kerry says the debate is over, the global is warming, climate change is happening, whatever.Over the weekend, he said he's not going to debate it anymore and took a shot at anyone who disagrees. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN F. KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE: The science is unequivocal, and those who refuse to believe it are simply burying their heads in the sand. The President and I -- Obama and I believe very deeply that we do not have time for a meeting anywhere of the flat earth society.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right, Greg. So you pointed something out important.GUTFELD: Well, yes, Jakarta has been often the target of terror attacks and listening to guy, I mean, one degree Celsius is somehow more damaging than Iranians getting a nuke?This is not a secretary of state. He could be secretary of H&R Block. You know why -- you can't make money off good news. You can only make money in the environmental movement if there's bad news.While the climate has warm slightly, hurricanes and cyclones have fallen. But this is great fact from Matt Ridley, since the 1920s, the global annual death rate from weather-related diseases has declined by 99 percent, and hurricanes that hit Mexico, no death. But when they hit places like Burma, of equal power, they kill 200,000.The answer is always going to be in prosperity and freedom. That's good news. He can't sell that.By the way, none of those people were listening to him. They were like going, you're out of your mind, you strange man.PERINO: They're wondering how much money can we get for that?GUTFELD: Yes,BOLLING: It's interesting -- the Senate Democrats late last week said this is the new thing. We're going to talk climate change now.So, over the weekend, the talk shows went there and John Kerry goes there as well. This is like concerted, how does this thing -- how does this happen?PERINO: I think that this is the influence of John Podesta, who recently left Citizens for American, what is it, CAP -- whatever it's called, and went to the White House. He's calling himself a strong environmentalist.I would call myself a strong environmentalist.Let's say on the science part they're right. I'm not saying that, but let's just say that they are. Their policy prescription is so weak that they never talk about it. So, what they have decided to do is fight on science grounds, and it's very unusual I think for the secretary of state to use language in a very undiplomatic way about flat earthers, people who might disagree with him.GUTFELD: In a foreign country.PERINO: And it was amazing if they had that much conviction about the people who are being killed in Syria. Just imagine if they would focus on the Geneva talks, rather than being in Indonesia talking about climate change. We were closer to an international agreement on climate change with the Asian Pacific region. Actually, there's no policy answer that John Kerry is offering right now.BOLLING: Bob, how do you explain that? Of all the things in the world right now, John Kerry figures this is the best thing to spend his time on?BECKEL: Let me say, we get in fights about this, so let me just say that there are those of us who agree with the National Academy of Science that says 99 percent of the published scientists in the world agree there's global warming --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: I know --BECKEL: Let's leave that aside. You don't agree with that. These guys see a cataclysmic situation developing if this continues. If it does, what Kerry is arguing about this being a weapon of mass destruction, if the oceans were to rise, just for the sake of argument, three or four inches, it would wipe out hundreds of millions of people.PERINO: But would they have to have a policy prescription --BECKEL: In Bangladesh alone.GUTFELD: That's not true.BECKEL: Why isn't it true?GUTFELD: I'll tell you -- well, go ahead.BOLLING: Well, I just wanted to throw out there, the study you're sighting over and over, again, is in fact debunked and we have it right here.BECKEL: Debunked by who?BOLLING: By ""The Journal of Science and Education."" They went back and looked at all this data and it turns out it wasn't 97 percent. It's less than half of 1 percent of the scientists.BECKEL: That's ridiculous. Just ridiculous.BOLLING: That the globe is warming because of manmade --BECKEL: That is simply -- anybody who put that out is bunk. That's bunk.BOLLING: Can I please get Andrea in here?TANTAROS: I'm just listening to you all talk. I think that Richard Lindzen, who we brought up before, MIT professor, has it right. And I think most people probably agree with him, which is, OK, a small amount has happened, but there's no need for alarm bells. There's no need to go crazy.I do think it falls probably somewhere in the middle. What I find is so bizarre is that John Kerry also is overseeing the Keystone pipeline. Why they would move that under the purview of the U.S. State Department.And I agree with Greg, it's not just the Indonesians saying that are probably going, what the heck is this guy talking about, there are probably terrorists in caves laughing their asses off, going, this is what the secretary of state has made his number one priority? Great, we're glad this is what they're going to focus on to control the lives of Americans while we plot to kill them.BOLLING: I have to do this. I'm sorry, Ands, to cut you off, I want to get this. This is something John Kerry also said in the speech. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KERRY: Climate change can now be considered another weapon of mass destruction, perhaps even the world's most fearsome weapon of mass destruction.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Go, Greg -- yes, go ahead.PERINO: You know what? The farther you get away from September 11th, the closer you are to September 10th.GUTFELD: Good point.Here's the science, like you said, temperatures haven't risen over 17 years. While CO2 has been rising. That distinction and discrepancy is unusual.But if there's a slight increase over the century in Celsius, that saves lives. A warmer climate allows you to grow more crops and more people die in cold weather. So they're actually arguing for more death.BECKEL: Wait a minute. When I was in the Peace Corps in the Philippines, three or four inch rise in the South China Sea will kill tens of millions of Filipinos.BOLLING: OK.GUTFELD: I would love to see the science on that, Bob.BECKEL: OK.BOLLING: All right. We're going.Ahead on ""The Five,"" Team USA hockey hero T.J. Oshie reveals what he was thinking when he scored the winning shot to through the legs of the Russian goalie. That shot earned team USA a victory on Russian ice. You'll hear from him.Plus, an NBC reporter pushed alpine skier Bode Miller to tears when she questioned him about his late brother moments after his win, did she go too far? I say no, but I'm definitely in the minority. You decide, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)TANTAROS: Three decades after the miracle on ice, we witnessed another one this weekend when Team USA's hockey players defeated Russia in an Olympic nail-biting thriller. T.J. Oshie scored the winning goal in a shootout during overtime. He scored four times on six tries.Today, Oshie spoke about the incredible moment and what he was thinking about right before it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What was going through your mind at that moment?T.J. OSHIE, TEAM USA HOCKEY TEAM: What do I do next? There's a little panic in there. I saw the replay. It looks like I wasn't shaking, but I was underneath, and really happy the last one went in.(END VIDEO CLIP)TANTAROS: Wow, that was an awesome game, wasn't it, Bob? You said you watched it.BECKEL: It was amazing. But I tell you the thing about it -- you know, to think about, when they have penalty kicks in soccer, for example, you know, there's a big, hung net, and there's a goalie. And it's pretty easy to get a ball in. When you're trying to shoot into a hockey net, it's a very small area, and these guys are very, very good, these goaltenders. These guy did four of 6, and the last one, he got in, he did it almost in slow motion -- he had the guy completely confused and boom, shot it right through his leg.TANTAROS: Had to feel very good to beat the Russians on their own turf.BOLLING: Yes, that's right. Maybe not be a miracle on ice, again, because that was amateurs playing against professionals. A little bit different.But really interesting about Oshie. There was a picture that got sent around Twitter right after that, with some military people in Afghanistan jumping up, clapping when he scored the winning goal. And that was like it went everywhere.And, Oshie, to this credit -- you know, people were saying you're a hero. He said, I'm not a hero. The people in camo are the real heroes.He's a great kid. He's a young, upcoming hockey player for the St. Louis Blues. But a great person on top of it.TANTAROS: I know, Dana, you said you didn't watch the game, you were at yoga, but you have to admire what Eric said about what he said about men in Camo, which is so different than what Hollywood actors have been saying, which is my job is just as dangerous as men and women.PERINO: Yes, I read about it, and my husband said the game was incredible. I do think it's interesting to listen to a lot of the interviews after these competitors come off the field or come off the ice, wherever it might be. They're very humble, and a lot of it seems very sincere to me.Unlike in the NFL, where it seems like it's all talking points when they come off the field. We talked about the things they have said and maybe they shouldn't have said. But these guys at the Olympics to me seem completely genuine.TANTAROS: Greg, you had your face painted, your entire body painted, in fact. Was it worth it?GUTFELD: It wasn't for the game, Andrea. That was for something completely different.Two things quickly -- Matt Lauer asks him, what is going through your mind? What's going through your mind? Just ask them what they're thinking. I'm so tired of hearing that.Also, Olympic hockey reflects the exceptionalism of American life. The players in the best teams all play in the NHL. Why? Because our system is better. There aren't players flocking to lot Latvia.PERINO: True.GUTFELD: I had to find some kind of political thing.TANTAROS: Yes.GUTFELD: But I didn't see the game.BECKEL: Exactly.TANTAROS: From a feel good moment to a not so feel good moment, a lot of people pretty outrages for a reporter from NBC, Christin Cooper, for pushing Bode Miller on the death of his brother before the Olympic Games. He lost his brother to a seizure last year.Here's the interview that's lighting up the internet.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRISTIN COOPER, NBC: Bode, you're showing so much emotion down here. What's going through your mind?BODE MILLER, OLYMPIAN: I mean, a lot. Just a tough year and --COOPER: I know you wanted to be here with Chelone, really experiencing these games. How much does it mean to you to come up with a great performance for him?MILLER: I wanted to come here and -- I don't know, I guess make myself proud.COOPER: When you're looking up in the sky, we see you there, and it looks like you're talking to somebody. What's going on there?(END VIDEO CLIP)TANTAROS: So, what do you think, Greg? Did the reporter go too far?GUTFELD: I don't think so. I mean, I don't think she was being mean. She was following up with a story. I get more annoyed by the fake outrage on Twitter, which to me is actually more obnoxious. People used to shout at the TV. Now they just go on Twitter, you know?But I don't know -- I think she was doing her job. I think he was -- if he forgave her, what's the deal?TANTAROS: That's what he did. He took to Twitter, Dana, and he said I forgive her. She was doing her job.PERINO: Yes. It's compelling story.BECKEL: Well, since I don't follow through this, so I don't know anything about what you're talking about.I can tell you this, having seen that, I think everything was fine until the last question, when she said, ""You're looking up into the sky."" What she obviously wanted him to say is -- yes, I'm talking to me dad brother -- just so superficial and plastic --(CROSSTALK)TANTAROS: You disagree, Eric?BOLLING: I completely disagree. Because I think, if you watch those -- those runs, you saw him doing it. You wondered what he was doing. I think she did her job. She pulled out of him the emotion.By the way, you can't win the down -- you can't win these events without having a lot of emotion and having something to ski for or whatever for. I think she did her job.By the way, there was a barrier between Bode Miller and Kristen Cooper. He could have clearly said, ""Thank you very much. The interview's over,"" any time he wanted to. He stayed for all five of the questions.PERINO: I think it's interviews like this and the future stories that NBC does this very well. Other networks do them well, too, but I think that's what draws you to watch the Olympics. And so if there hadn't been any personal stories and he went through a tragedy and he skied, and he's been in the American life -- public life for a long time, it would just be like watching any other competition. The Olympics, I think, are different.BECKEL: Yes, but -- go.TANTAROS: I was going to say, it humanized him. I don't think -- I agree with you. I don't think it was that bad.Also, he started the interview, if you watch the full interview, talking about the emotion that he had. So he tipped it off. She didn't go there first.BOLLING: That's right.TANTAROS: So he went there first, and I don't think she saw him tearing. He just wiped his eye, and then the tears started to flow after the third question. So I don't -- I actually don't think it was that bad.All right. Directly ahead, it's Presidents' Day, and we'll tell you which of the 44 are our faves. Can you guess? Next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.JOHN F. KENNEDY, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.RONALD REAGAN, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate.Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.(END VIDEO CLIP)BECKEL: Today is Presidents' Day, time to celebrate the people who had the honor to lead this great nation. There have been 44 so far, some of them better than others. All right, Andrea, who's your pick for the best president?TANTAROS: I think it's George Washington. And I feel like he was just one of the greatest leaders that we've ever had. He knew that we needed to get away from a monarchy, and backed a republic instead of a democracy, which is fascinating if you read about him.And he was just a leader in every sense of the word. He also was offered the position of king but turned it down. And that is so different from politicians these days that just want the power. I mean, he was totally devoted to this nation and making it great.BECKEL: And didn't really want to be president.Eric, let me guess. Let me guess. It's so obvious. Please, let me do it for you.BOLLING: OK. Go ahead.BECKEL: Ronald Reagan.BOLLING: Yes. For two reasons. No. 1 -- two very obvious reasons. No. 1, because he brought us out of what was malaise. Remember? Morning in America again? Here's what he did. He brought us -- he saved the economy. He saved the country through the economy.And No. 2, probably more importantly, another thing he did, he won what would be the biggest, the -- by far the biggest war the planet has ever seen, the Cold War. He won the Cold War without firing one single shot.BECKEL: No help from the Democrats at all either, right?BOLLING: What?BECKEL: No help from the Democrats at all? Go ahead.BOLLING: Is Gorbachev a Democrat?BECKEL: That's funny.PERINO: Well, Bob, this will shock you. You might not have heard, but I worked for President George W. Bush, so he is my choice.TANTAROS: It would be weird if you didn't pick him.BECKEL: Yes.PERINO: It would be weird. It would be weird. And actually, I believe it.BECKEL: You do?PERINO: Yes, I do.BECKEL: OK.GUTFELD: Well, my favorite president is Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho. He was the president in the film ""Idiocracy."" He managed the decline of America in style and with pets. An amazing leader. You didn't mess with him. Look at that hair. There he is.BECKEL: All right. OK, Greg. Leave it to you on Presidents' Day.All right. Mine is a fairly obvious choice for me, too, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, for several reasons. One, he brought us through and out of a depression. He brought a nation that was very reluctant to go to war into the Second World War, and if it hadn't been for him, we'd have been living under Hitler and Mussolini in the west. I think he brought us Social Security. He brought us so many things, it's hard even to begin to add them together. He was a great, great president, and it was more than just one war he dealt with.TANTAROS: Can Lincoln get an honorable mention?BECKEL: Yes. Lincoln should get an honorary mention. Absolutely.""One More Thing"" is up next.GUTFELD: Calvin Coolidge.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: Time now for ""One More Thing"" -- Eric.BOLLING: OK, Friday afternoon, Friday night, a huge labor decision went down in Tennessee. The UAW was trying to unionize a VW plant in Tennessee. An important part of this is VW actually allowed the UAW to come in and pitch their story, and the workers at the VW plant -- go ahead -- rejected it. DOA.Very important going forward because that's the south right to work state. And if they unionize there, it could have spread to other plants. So it's good news.BECKEL: It's a terrible story.BOLLING: For the free market.GUTFELD: It's a great story.TANTAROS: Very interesting story.GUTFELD: Yes. Andrea.TANTAROS: This is a better story. Guess what turns 30 today?GUTFELD: Pajama boy?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KEVIN BACON, ACTOR: This is a party. Let's dance!(END VIDEO CLIP)TANTAROS: Yes, it's been 30 years since Kevin Bacon got on that tractor in that nail biter of a scene where he had to make the other guy jump off, and he did that very sexy performance in the factory. But it's turned 30, and I can't believe it's that old already. But what a great movie.BECKEL: I never saw that movie.TANTAROS: You never saw ""Footloose""?BECKEL: No.PERINO: You think in 30 years, that movie -- I was so excited to see that movie. In 30 years we've gone from ""Footloose"" to twerking. I mean, time goes by fast.GUTFELD: That is progress, at least in my mind.PERINO: Isn't it profound?GUTFELD: Not a big fan of ""Footloose.""PERINO: I loved it.GUTFELD: I thought it was going to be about something else. Anyway, where am I? Dana.PERINO: OK, I'm going to go quickly, because I have two things.Everybody loves spring training. The Yankees are down in Tampa. Look who else loves spring training. This was caught at spring training today in Tampa. So that means that hopefully the weather is going to get better.And then Bob and I want to hold up our new cups. And thank you so much to Rebecca Reith (ph) and Sally Tatum (ph) of Black Pug Pottery. They are educators and they just retired. And...BOLLING: What's it say?PERINO: It says -- I'm ""Jasper's Mom,"" and Bob's says, ""I love Jasper.""BECKEL: Now, you folks had that a little wrong, but thank you very much for the...PERINO: No, they know that you actually really love him.Thank you, guys.BOLLING: Beautiful mugs.PERINO: They did a nice job.BOLLING: Yes.PERINO: Black Pug Pottery.GUTFELD: All right. Oh, me? Banned phrase, ""Zero sum."" You hear this a lot these days. I'm not so sure the people using it understand what it means. It means if someone wins, someone loses. Like if you take a slice of cake, the bigger slice, the less somebody else gets. It's how liberals see the economy.PERINO: Zero sum.GUTFELD: Zero sum. They don't grow the cake. They only see that if I have a slice, I'm taking it from somebody else.BECKEL: There you go.TANTAROS: They ban a cake because there's too much sugar in it.GUTFELD: Exactly.BECKEL: All right. Can I move on to mine?GUTFELD: Yes.BECKEL: Thank you. Gabe Sonnier, who was a janitor at a school in Louisiana, started off as a janitor 30 years ago. The principal said, you know, ""I'd rather have you test -- score papers than pick them up.""He went back to school. He got his degree, a teacher's degree. He went on to become a teacher in the same school he was a janitor in.TANTAROS: Oh, that's cool.BECKEL: And very recently, he became principal of that school after getting a master's degree. Congratulations.TANTAROS: Congratulations. That's great.BECKEL: It's a great story.TANTAROS: I love that story. How did you find that ""One More Thing""? Who found that for you, Bob?BECKEL: I found it myself. I found it myself.BOLLING: Nice private school?BECKEL: No, it's not a private school, you jerk off.PERINO: We were doing so well.GUTFELD: Way to go. Almost made it to the end of the show.Set your DVRs so you don't miss an episode of ""The Five.""Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

In 1936 for example they were held in Berlin, Germany presided over by one Adolph Hitler. It was in those games where American track star Jesse Owens humiliated the third Reich.This year the games in Russia now a bit of controversy. NBC sports anchor Bob Costas lit the fuse.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BOB COSTAS, NBC NEWS SPORTS ANCHOR: At the center of every question is the country's President Vladimir Putin. He was the central force behind bringing these games here. And just in the past year Putin brokered a deal to allow Syria to avoid a U.S. military strike by giving up its chemical weapons and help bring Iran to the negotiating table over its nuclear intentions. And he has repeatedly showcased his confidence to take on the West, particularly the United States.(END VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: What Mr. Costas stated is true, but the context is weak. Vladimir Putin is a villain, a former KGB thug. He's the prime supporter of the Syrian murderer Assad. Sure he tried to stop any military action against Assad. He's his buddy. But it was not obviously for humanitarian reasons. Again, in Iran Putin protects the crazy mullahs who are causing trouble all over the place.So if you are going to profile a guy like Putin, you really have to bring a lot of perspective and NBC Sports simply did not. Thus the predictable happened.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIMBAUGH: Everybody is up in arms because Costas got out there and he started praising Putin. Why is everybody surprised that NBC News would laud praise over a Soviet KGB leader when they are his prisoner for two weeks as the televising network? And besides that, there is not that much ideological difference anyway.(END VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: Conservative Michelle Malkin tweeted quote, ""Putin sycophant Bob Costas wins gold medal for authoritarian a-kissing"" unquote.Now it's surely true that NBC does not want to tee off Putin they need Russian cooperation on all fronts. But I know Costas. He's not some crazy left wing guy who would celebrate a man like Putin. He was simply reading a script designed to be innocuous. But these days nothing is innocuous. Everything is political. Therefore Bob Costas finds himself once again on the defensive.""Talking Points"" always likes to analyze events from the shoes of the people in them. I would not -- would not have read the script that Costas read. However, I don't believe that Costas and NBC Sports meant any harm at all. So for me, it's a wash.And that's ""The Memo."""
2	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/02/11/politics-or-policy-behind-latest-obamacare-delay/	Politics or policy behind latest ObamaCare delay?	"This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" February 11, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ANDREA TANTAROS, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Andrea Tantaros, along with Bob Beckel, Eric Bolling, Dana Perino, and Greg Gutfeld.It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is ""The Five.""(MUSIC)TANTAROS: Well, yesterday, the Obama administration delayed the president's signature health care law for the 27th time since November 2012. The latest companies who have more than 50 employees but less than 100 will now have until January to comply with the law's mandates.Now, earlier today, President Obama offered his justification for the latest punt.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This was an example of administratively us making sure that we're smoothing out this transition, giving people the opportunities to get right with the law. But recognizing that there are going to be circumstances in which people are trying to do the right thing and it may take a little bit of time.(END VIDEO CLIP)TANTAROS: Charles Krauthammer sees this as another example of lawlessness within the administration.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: This is stuff that you do in a banana republic. It's as if a law is simply a blackboard on which Obama writes any number he wants, any delay he wants, and any provision. It's now reached a point where it is so endemic that nobody even notices or complains. It's not uncommon, willful breaking of the constitutional order. Where in the Constitution is a president allowed to alter a law 27 times after it's been passed?(END VIDEO CLIP)TANTAROS: Well, as for the delay ending after the 2014 midterms, ""Time's"" Mark Halperin sees one possible explanation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK HALPERIN, TIME: This latest delay I think is really going to set people off more than the others simply because it involves delay past the election.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.HALPERIN: You know, past the election, and that screams of politics without an alternative explanation.(END VIDEO CLIP)TANTAROS: All right. So, mixed messages from the White House, Greg. Last week, we sat around this table and we talked about how ObamaCare would liberate people from job lock, from the jobs that were terrible and they can go be artists and be free now, and this week, they want them to stay in their jobs, so they extend the mandate yet again for purely political reasons, I'm guessing?GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yes. It's -- when you lost your health plan, they said they were liberating you from a bad health plan. When you lose your job, they say they're liberating you from a job you don't like.You have to wonder, what will they liberate from you next? Will they liberate you from your home? Will they liberate you from your life? Euthanasia makes life easier for an eternity. You no longer have to breathe.That's the nature of socialism is that they tell you what you want.This is the 27th delay. It's not a delay. It's a reprieve. The economy is essentially like a death row inmate, and Obama is putting off the needle until after the election.TANTAROS: Yes.A lot of people, Dana, believe this is political. Republicans are coming out saying, OK, why don't you just delay the whole thing, or delay it for individuals as well? What do you think Republicans should be pushing for, if anything?DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Well, I think there's two pieces. One is obviously it's political. And in a political year, like a 2014, in a midterm election when the opposition party -- this time, it's the Republicans -- when that base is energized anyway, then the politics of it matters because people are fired up and those are the people that turn out to vote.I do wonder if on the ObamaCare decision yesterday, if the administration isn't slightly more worried about the structural problems of the law than they are letting on. I think the CBO report was a big wake-up call. In addition to that, there was a big Democratic meeting last weekend when they were complaining to the president about the drag that ObamaCare is having on their races.But if you take that plus the business concern, plus the CBO report, I think that they have realized that it is a bigger drag on the economy than they thought. And it perhaps, this is actually going to get punted well into the future, and it might not ever actually end up taking place. But the individuals that don't have a lobbyist, they're the ones that will have to continue to take it on the chin.TANTAROS: Yes, that's right.Eric, Charles Krauthammer went on to say he believes eventually the mandate will go away. Do you think that's true? Do you think they will have to scrap the mandate?ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Don't have to. So, I'm trying to figure it out. A delay is good, permanent delay would be best, but delaying just until the after 2014, yes, whatever, year after the 2014 midterms, which they're very, very concerned about, especially since everyone on the right things they should run against Democrats and hang ObamaCare on them, sounds a lot more like politics than good policy. That's the problem.But the bottom line -- when you just take a step back, listen to the administration, listen to President Obama, we're delaying the mandate for companies, we're delaying the mandate for smaller companies. If delaying is helping them out, why don't we just get rid of it? Why do we even bother with this thing?There's -- if you -- in 2016, so now we're going to say we realize that was good for you, but guess what, now your delay is over. Now you have to pay up. That's bad. Let's just get rid of it. There's no reason to have it.TANTAROS: Isn't that a subtle admission, delaying it, that the law is hurting businesses? So, what difference does it make if it's hurting them now, Bob, or hurting them in two years?BOB BECKEL, CO-HOST: Well, first of all, without the mandate, if you don't like this law, you shouldn't be against the mandate because it will tear apart the entire law. You have to have the mandate to work.The second thing I would say is the United States Supreme Court ruled the mandate to be a tax. The Treasury Department has enormous latitude when it comes to how and when they implement a tax. They can give it, they can take it, they can modify it, they can back it off. It's happened for 100 years, 150 years, they have done that.So, I don't see why this is necessarily something out of the policy realm. Do I think this is politics? Sure.Do I think Halperin knows what he's talking about when he says everyone is going to wake up and think about it? No, Mark, they're really not. Most Americans don't think about these things in the morning. You may, but most people don't.So, I don't think people are going to read it that way. We -- the chattering class will read it that way for a good reason. I mean, it's a smart political move, frankly, the things that I would do. But without a mandates, you don't have law, and without a law, you have 40 million people uninsured.BOLLING: So, once the politics are over and 2014 is in the rear view mirror, let's get back to what we really want to do and do some mandated health care, when it's not -- people don't want it. If they wanted it, they would run on it.BECKEL: Who doesn't want it?BOLLING: Americans don't want it, Bob. Americans don't want it.(CROSSTALK)BECKEL: Can you tell me there aren't people with their pitchforks if they don't have insurance right now?(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: No, the question -- you say this is perfectly fine because it's a tax, but it was never sold to us as a tax. It was sold to us as hope and change. And it seems striking that the president keeps rescheduling his hope and change.And it seems striking that the president keeps rescheduling his hope and change. It's like a prostate exam without the benefits. He keeps pushing it off. It goes back to this. It doesn't matter if it's a tax or not. If it's so great, why won't he do it?TANTAROS: Well, didn't he say we can't wait, we can't wait, we can't wait, we can't wait for my agenda. We can wait for everything. We can't wait for everything except ObamaCare. We can wait.Here's my point on this, Bob. You say small business, or most people don't wake up thinking about this law, most Americans don't. I think most business owners do, and I think most business owners employees do as well because they want to know what their boss is planning for the next year and following years because that's how business owners plan.I do agree with you on one thing. I don'ts think they're going to get rid of the mandate because that is the glue that holds the whole thing together, the mandates, and then what incentive would any boss, Dana, have for not just taking all their employees and dumping them right into the exchanges, or keeping their wages low so that they can be eligible for the subsidies.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: That's why employees really care because you take away capital that could be used to reinvest in the company for raises, bonuses, or, you know, a new gym that needs renovated in the building. In addition to that, the CBO report last week again reiterates that after -- even if the employer mandate went through and after it's fully implemented, the United States of America will still have 31 million people who don't have health insurance, so what did we do this for?Bob, I don't know -- I don't know how to argue with you about the CBO numbers. If you don't accept what CBO says, they say 31 million uninsured after this. So, your point about 40 million are insured that weren't before, how do you square the circle on 31 million?BECKEL: I assume that means implementing the health care law the way it is, we end up with 31 million unemployed.PERINO: This was -- on the day that they passed the law, that the president signed the law, the CBO said 31 million will remain uninsured. Last week, even after the implementation is underway, they still say 31 million people uninsured at the end of implementation.BOLLING: Actually, 10 years down the road. In a decade, there will be the same number uninsured as there are right now.BECKEL: I -- you asked me if I had taken the time to read the Republican proposal for health care, so I decided for once in my life I would actually read them. They are the typical health savings account crap that was pushed around. The -- it is nothing. It is putting everything out in the free market and let granny go ahead and pay a lot more than she could.BOLLING: I don't know why the Republicans don't do this. I said it before, I swear to you, this is -- it's not free market completely. But it's quasi free market -- certainly a lot freer than what we have right now because we have a mandate.Remove the mandate. Let government provide an alternative, not a mandate, but an alternative. And if they want to go ahead and get aggressive on price, they'll go get -- they'll -- don't kill me for saying this, they'll put the lowest insurance price on the board.BECKEL: Alternative, what kind of alternative are you talking about?TANTAROS: All right.BOLLING: Insurance.BECKEL: OK. Well, fine, then why don't we do that?BOLLING: Yes, we should.BECKEL: We have it. We have called Medicaid, is it not?BOLLING: No, we don't, Bob. We have a mandate. You don't have a choice. You have to be signed up on insurance.If you have the government spending a quarter of what they're spending right now, offering a government-alternative insurance program, you're going to drive the prices down.BECKEL: OK. So, you're saying people don't have to take insurance.BOLLING: No.BECKEL: I see.TANTAROS: Before we get into the weed of a policy discussion on what Democrats should have done, it's obvious they're not going to do that. What they're doing now, Greg, is they actually running from President Obama because of all the headlines and sound clips that we played. Listen to Claire McCaskill, who is a supporter of the president, on another network this morning say, yes, you know what, I can't blame Democrats for not wanting to be seen with him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HALPERIN: If you were running for re-election in Arkansas, Louisiana, or North Carolina, would you invite the president in and campaign side-by- side with him?SEN. CLAIRE MCCASKILL (D), MISSSOURI: Probably not. I mean, this is -- you know, I mean -- I try to be really candid and honest on this show. You know, the president's numbers are not strong in my state or in Arkansas or in Louisiana, or North Carolina.(END VIDEO CLIP)TANTAROS: I'm guessing there's going to be a lot of scheduling conflicts. The senators on one side of the state and the president's on the other, we just can't seem to come together.BECKEL: They have nothing to offer to go out there. They understand the reality of this. They lost virtually every state, Obama did, besides it's a really tough election.TANTAROS: Thank you, Greg Gutfeld, for answering.BECKEL: I'm sorry, Greg.GUTFELD: If the candidates choose not to run with Obama, how is that not racist? Remember anyone who disagreed with his liberal agenda was smeared as racist? Will the NAACP call out all these cowardly white Democrats for deserting their black leader when he really needs them? It's disgusting.What do you think, Bob? She's a racist.BECKEL: I don't know. I know that not many people want to campaign with Bush. Certainly nobody wanted to campaign with Carter.GUTFELD: But they weren't called racist.BECKEL: No, I guess they weren't called racists. They were called honkies. I don't know.TANTAROS: Quick response, Dana.PERINO: I do admire her candidness. I mean, at least she was honest. She was like, yes, no, I don't want to. And actually that helps her going forward, because every time he's going to come by Missouri, she doesn't actually have to appear with him anymore. She's basically ripped the Band- Aid off and now they know, don't go to Missouri.BOLLING: Can you imagine the Democrats are running from Obama, the signature legislation, in his term?GUTFELD: Running from a black man. Racist. Racist.BECKEL: Have you ever seen somebody in a tough Senate race get close to a president with negative numbers?BOLLING: No, my points is, look, if ObamaCare is really popular, everyone loved it, they would all want Obama in their state going, hey, this is my deal. This is our deal.BECKEL: If you were a liberal, everybody would love you.BOLLING: We help them passed that.(CROSSTALK)TANTAROS: All right, Bob. All right, Eric.BOLLING: He helped him passed that.TANTAROS: OK. Ahead on ""The Five"", Dana and Eric return to the Westminster dog show where they caught up with some canine competitors sprinting for tonight's finale of best in show. So, should Jasper and Freedom be jealous?BOLLING: Those are good boys.First, Bob Costas has been sporting a bad case of pinkeye during NBC's Olympic coverage. So, could vodka be the cure? I say vodka cures everything. We'll explain, next on ""The Five"".(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Welcome back, everybody.The fastest seven minutes, three juicy stories, seven jackrabbit minutes, one jocular host.First up, it's imperative to do your homework. When you host a news show, especially interview segments. So, take a look at this. Here's Laurence Fishburne and Samuel Jackson.Now, watch CNN affiliate KTLA's entertainment reporter Sam Rubin bungled this interview.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SAM RUBIN, KTLA: You're working for Marvel, the Super Bowl commercial. Did you get a lot of reaction to the Super Bowl commercial?SAMUEL L. JACKSON, ACTOR: What Super Bowl commercial?RUBIN: Oh, you know what, my mistake.JACKSON: You know what, you're as crazy as the people on twitter. I'm not Laurence Fishburne.RUBIN: That's my fault. I know that. My mistake.JACKSON: We don't all look alike. You're the entertainment reporter.RUBIN: I know.JACKSON: You're the entertainment reporter for this station, and you don't know the difference between me and Laurence Fishburne?RUBIN: My mistake, I apologize. My big mistake.JACKSON: Must be a very short line for your job.(END VIDEO CLIP)(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Greg, you've done the interviews. Have you ever called a guy -- or did you ever interview the wrong guy?GUTFELD: No, never. People are going to say, OK, this is racist. It's not. It's stupidity. Sometimes stupidity is the cause of all things that are stupid.But entertainment reporters, Sam Jackson got it right. They aren't really the top of the line. That's why they're doing entertainment. They don't do investigative reporting, they don't read anything. Half the time, they don't see the movies they're talking about.PERINO: But they have good jobs and they fulfill a great need for people that need entertainment news.GUTFELD: Are you defending somebody I should be defending?PERINO: No, I'm trying to be positive.GUTFELD: No, I just think, yes, he was an idiot.BOLLING: Cringe-worthy, D.PERINO: Yes, whatever. Samuel Jackson, if you only read the transcript, you would think he was going after him and being aggressive. I thought he handled it very well and playful and I thought that was cute.BOLLING: I love --BECKEL: I'm the entertainment reporter for this show, and I'll tell you everything you need to know about entertainment. Dumb.BOLLING: So, what about this one? He had the wrong guy.BECKEL: Yes, he did. Which one is that, by the way? Is that Fishburne or is that Jackson?PERINO: Jackson.BOLLING: That's Samuel L. Jackson.I went to book Representative Steve King, it was the wrong one.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: So, Ands --BECKEL: In Iowa?BOLLING: That's who I thought I was booking. Go ahead.TANTAROS: It's tough to keep congressman straight sometimes. It is.PERINO: That's true.GUTFELD: Especially some congressmen.PERINO: I knew you were going to say that.TANTAROS: Cue the symbols.You know, entertainment topics are already so light. They have such a low bar just to get their names straight. But this is why I over-prepare for TV appearances, because maybe a producer put that in his packet, so this happened on the Ellen show, right?Ellen's producer put Travis Barker, I think we have a picture of this, under Pink's wife, Carey Hart. And Pink laughed and said, let's handle it with some humor there.So mistakes are made, but you know, he maybe looks like him a little bit.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Good point.PERINO: I might start deploying that strategy.BOLLING: All right. If you're a regular FIVE watcher, you know we have been pretty tough on NBC host Bob Costas for some time, for some of the stupid things he says when he ventures too far outside of the friendly confines of sports.But, you've got to feel bad for the guy first. Check out his eyes. First it was his left eye, and now it looks like it's got pinkeye in both of his eyes smack dab in the middle of the Olympic coverage. I think he needs a vodka shot.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BOB COSTAS, NBC NEWS: I'm told in Russia, guaranteed, not some kind of water or something.HOST: Is this the Hoda and Kathie Lee portion of the --COSTAS: Yes.I'm not really that much of a vodka guy. I'm looking at it this way, though. My eyes can't get any redder no matter what I do.HOST: I'll drink to that.COSTAS: Down the hatch.HOST: Really? Wow.COSTAS: Tomorrow morning, I'll be lying on a curb in Minsk.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Everything was going to fine except for that last line. Tomorrow morning, I'll be lying in a curb in Minsk because he had a vodka shot?TANTAROS: What a lightweight.BECKEL: I had a lot of diseases, but that one is really nasty. And I got to get -- let me tell you, I watched the Olympics a little bit. I think NBC and Costas have done a terrific job putting this Olympics on. Some of the stuff I dumped on like the skateboarding thing, I was wrong. It turned out to be great.GUTFELD: You mean the snowboarding?BECKEL: The snowboarding. I'm under prepared.BOLLING: Here's the question, I think they said, what, a billion people are going to watch this? If you had pinkeye on both eyes, would you go on the air?TANTAROS: If it meant getting a vodka shot, maybe. I mean, I had a fever in college. I'm not a doctor, folks, I just play one in certain segments. And I went out, my friends convinced me to go out and it cured my fever, and all I drank was vodka all night.BOLLING: What about the TV part of it? The eyes are all watering?TANTAROS: It was kind of gross to look at. I mean --BOLLING: Dana, you're feeling bad for him?PERINO: I feel bad -- I have some pretty serious eye problems myself, so I felt bad for him. I don't have pinkeye. I have more of a chronic problem.TANTAROS: You're just (INAUDIBLE).PERINO: I know my eyes look bad quite a lot of the time. His look is really bad. I feel terrible for him because there's kind of nothing you can do. Time is the only thing that cures it.BOLLING: We've got to go. But, Greg, would you go on air with pinkeye?GUTFELD: Well, you know what? I think he's promoting my show, ""Red Eye"", but he was looking for Visine, not vodka. That gets the red out.But he was playing -- the other thing that bugs me, he was playing into the stereotype of Russia. If he was in Jamaica, would he smoke a joint?BOLLING: Maybe.BECKEL: Probably.(CROSSTALK)BECKEL: I don't feel uncomfortable at all. I have been on many TV shows in the morning with red eyes.BOLLING: We have to do this very quickly. Finally, what are you having for dinner tonight? Chicken, pasta, burgers? It's Tuesday, so I'll be fasting. But tonight, POTUS and FLOTUS will be hosting President Francois Hollande, who happens to be flying solo tonight at a state dinner at the White House. And check out the menu.A feast fit for royalty, all paid for, by the way, you, the taxpayer. Let me read a couple things very quickly. First course, American caviar, then you move on to the winter garden salad with some merlot lettuce red wine vinaigrette, dry aged beef, what's -- here, Jasper farm blue cheese.PERINO: Yes, I think I have gotten in their head.BOLLING: You know, nice but --PERINO: Yes. Look, I'm for the state dinners. I think France is a weird choice, but fine, if they wanted to bring the French in. If you're going to have a state dinner, America needs to show that we can do it very well. And they have people from all over America that are participating, the beef is coming from a family in Greely, Colorado. So I'm for it, I like it.BECKEL: This goes down as one of the cheapest shots we've done on the show, every state dinner -- of course, only Obama. Every person has at least that kind of food and a lot more. Of course, we have to beat up on Obama.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: I disagree. I look at this menu. Braised charred quail eggs, baby carrots -- this is disgusting. We need to impeach the White House chef.BECKEL: Yes.BOLLING: Ands, Bob makes a point. All other presidents have done this, but I'm not sure. Like the first few dinners, state dinners, they were in excess of $500,000.BECKEL: And the average of every other president.PERINO: You know what? I agree with Bob. I actually agree with you, Bob. I hate when we do these segments. I actually think they're stupid.And to give the White House credit, the initial dinner was half a million bucks, you point out, of the Indian prime minister. Now, they have cut costs down to about $200,000, so they have sliced the budget.And, by the way, what are we supposed to give them, KFC in a bucket? I mean, seriously.BOLLING: No, no. I'm not sure. OK --TANTAROS: No one is talking about the food, anyway. They're talking about the fact that this guy fathered his child with his mistress.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Did you see how much it cost?TANTAROS: They won't say.BOLLING: Right.TANTAROS: I think it's stupid. Everybody is talking ability his love child anyway. No one cares about the food.BECKEL: Reagan gave hotdogs, I'm sure.BOLLING: We've got to go.Up next, new developments to the search for answers in Benghazi. A congressional committee slams the White House and the State Department for dropping the ball on security leading for terror attacks. But will we ever find out who pushed the video? Details ahead on ""The Five"".(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: If there's one word that causes groans from the White House and their media harlots like Bob, it's Benghazi. I get it, for the media, it's a scar on their Mona Lisa. Worse, vital questions have messed with conspiracy. The louder voices make the others sound crazy.The Dems go-to response, there's no there there. I get it.However, there's one question that needs a simple answer, and you know it. Who pushed the video? It has not a link to conspiracy. It's just a question.It's simple -- 2016 looms like an entitlement for the Clintons, which reminds us of why the video was pushed in the first place. It's always been about elections, 2012, 2016.And also, about an instinct to blame America first. The video was pushed to take the heat off Hillary and her boss and to place it on us, the West. Blame the video, then question us about security, delayed responses, and arrests fade, and they avoid accusations of Islamophobia.Blaming the video tosses all of us into a tiny jail cell as you pretend to Christian with a funny name did all this.The finishing touch, our government buying wimpy ads on Pakistani TV to apologize. Nice work.But the accolades go to the media who embraced the lie, then moved on as the lie unraveled. I'd say the media swept it under the rug, but the media is that rug. No wonder reporters take yoga. You've got to be limber for such contortions.And it's all part of the Obama administration's motto. Everything blows over, and it always does when it's the media doing the blowing.I have no idea.BOLLING: I see what you did there.GUTFELD: I didn't do anything.BOLLING: Yes, you did.GUTFELD: No, I did nothing.TANTAROS: Liar.GUTFELD: I had nothing.TANTAROS: Sick, sick human being.GUTFELD: I had nothing.Andrea, so the Republicans have investigated Benghazi and they blame the White House and State Department for failures. I suppose that's not surprising. Will this have any impact on the media who just look at it as a bunch of angry Republicans?TANTAROS: No, probably not. They don't really care, because no one is coming out and telling the truth about Benghazi.What was interesting is when Jonathan Karl came out with his report, it was funny. Then the media caught on because they said, wow, ABC is finally waking up to this.GUTFELD: Yes.TANTAROS: But we learned the three phases of Benghazi, right? The pre, the during, the night and the after. There's a scandal in each one.We learn that despite repeated requests for security, they ignored even direct cables from the ambassador himself. Why was his security taken away from him that night? How did al Qaeda know he was moving around the country?It is a scandal. If it's not a scandal, it's incredible incompetence, and nobody has come to the table and said, wow, we really messed up. They said, it doesn't make a difference.GUTFELD: Yes, Bob, the thing is, you just boil it done to one simple question that never gets answered, then it's not a conspiracy. It's just simple curiosity. Why can't it be answered?BECKEL: Well, first of all, the idea that somehow his security was taken away from him and his movements were known --TANTAROS: According to this report, Bob, security requests were specifically downgraded.BECKEL: I agree.TANTAROS: Downgraded in Libya.BECKEL: The way you said it, it sounds like they set him up to be killed. Let me give you the Republicans' answer to that. Their report concludes that no U.S. military assets could have arrived in Benghazi in time to affect the outcome of the attack, according to the committee.Now, I sat at this table, and you, particularly, Eric, and I think the rest of you agreed, there were planes in Italy, there are people sitting in Tripoli, (INAUDIBLE), and this proves what I said, there was no way you could get to save those people.And who leaked the video? It was on al Qaeda a week -- it was on al Jazeera a week before it was used --GUTFELD: Who pushed the video?BECKEL: Who pushed? Well, OK.BOLLING: There's something you're missing.BECKEL: I assume they did.BOLLING: There's a good chance we didn't have assets to save Chris Stevens and I believe Shawn Smith who was with him at the first. But Doherty and the other guy were killed some four or five hours later. I'm sorry, seven or eight hours later.BECKEL: Go argue with the Republican majority.BOLLING: Look, here's --BECKEL: This is a dead issue.BOLLING: General Ham was the one who we needed to hear about.GUTFELD: For some people.BOLLING: General Ham testified and said, look, they knew about it in D.C. Leon Panetta met with President Obama and they knew. And then the stuff still continued to happen.Bill O'Reilly asked President Obama the right question in his interview around the Super Bowl. He said, where's Leon Panetta's testimony? Let's get Leon Panetta back on the stand and ask him now after -- I know he testified before, but ask him now after General Ham testified, hey, is ham right? Did you guys know this was an attack immediately?If you did, who push the video?GUTFELD: Exactly.Last word, Dana -- Paramount is going to make a film on Benghazi.PERINO: I'm sure.GUTFELD: Yes, do you think it will be more truthful than the ""Innocence of Muslims""?PERINO: If paramount can answer the question, the paramount question, who pushed the video, that would be very helpful. The explanation of the video as an excuse can only mean there's a cover-up for politics and the administration will continue to face scrutiny. And if they don't want to answer it, that's fine, but I do think that, Bob, I think that Republicans, when they wake up in the country, they think, why can't that simple question be answered? And that will matter in 2014.TANTAROS: And shouldn't Bill O'Reilly have asked him what he was doing the night of the attack? I'm curious to know where the commander in chief was.BECKEL: I didn't hear the Republican -- it was Greg Gutfeld who kept saying who pushed the video? I didn't hear the members of the committee make it, they're out of everything else to talk about, they're now back to the video.GUTFELD: All right. Directly ahead, Christians around the world continue to be targeted. It's gotten so bad a hearing about it was held on Capitol Hill, and Bob is not happy about the problem. He'll explain next on ""The Five"".(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BECKEL: The targeting of questions around the world has been a serious and escalating crisis that quite frankly makes my blood boil. In a rare appearance on Capitol Hill, an archbishop for the Vatican testified before a House subcommittee about the widespread persecution of Christians in the Middle East.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ARCHBISHOP FRANCIS CHULLIKATT, VATICAN REPRESENTATIVE: Flagrant and widespread persecution of Christians rages in the Middle East, even as we meet. Arab Christians, a small but significant community, find themselves the target of constant harassment for no reason other than their religious faith.(END VIDEO CLIP)BECKEL: Very well put.And also, I want to throw in here, I want to know specifically where the countries, the Muslim countries, the presidents of those countries or the dictators of those countries or the kingdoms of those countries are when this takes place. Where you are is you're hiding and you're cowards, as I have said many times before.But the U.N. has something to play in here, too. In the Central African Empire where people were hung the other day who were Christians, they sat by and watched.Now, at some point somewhere around this world, somebody is going to stand up for Christians. If you're not going to do it, we may have to take things into our own hands.Go ahead, Eric.BOLLING: You know, I'm Catholic, and I'm a Christian, and I think it's atrocious what's going on. I think us highlighting things like this testimony is the best we can do. I'm not sure you're going to get response from dictators who don't care about ""The Five"" too much, but the more people get to know and the more groundswell of awareness, I don't think people who are watching today really realize how much of it is going on.BECKEL: And that includes the president of the United States, I might add.BOLLING: You guys, to the credit of the producers of ""The Five"", good job for highlighting it.BECKEL: Why this White House and the State Department are staying silent on this, I do not know?Dana?PERINO: I would imagine that they would say they're working on it behind the scenes and trying to deal with it diplomatically, but you could -- I think it's fair to argue that they could be turning up the heat a little bit.I would point people to Pete Weiner's article and commentary magazine yesterday about how Christians should be speaking out against countries that are criminalizing homosexuality with multiple hundreds of thousands of people -- I was saying hundreds of thousands, but thousands of people being arrested, beaten for being gay, and Christians -- if we're going to call on Muslims to defend Christians, Christians ought to speak out to defend people's human dignity.BECKEL: Yo!TANTAROS: That's a great question. Yo.You said take matters into our own hands? How about taking our money and keeping it in our own hands? We give the United Nations $7.96 billion, and that's a low estimate, the United States gives them from all different agencies, and this report that the U.N. put out is such hypocrisy and such projection. They're lecturing the Catholic Church on rape somehow, and the U.N. has its own shady history with rape.I think it would be interesting to give a copy of this report to the Muslim countries that are not in favor of homosexuality and have them be at odds with the United Nations. I mean, a lot of these countries, as Dana mentioned, discriminate against homosexuals and the U.N. is a very pro- Muslim organization. Why not shove it back in their face?BECKEL: Greg?GUTFELD: You know, it's not just the persecution of Christians. It's the persecution of people. By coincidence, by radical Islamists. It's always radical Islamists.Radical Islam should be the uniting force for Christians, gays, Buddhists, Vladimir Putin. We all have the same crazy neighbor. It's that house on the block with newspaper all over the windows, and it smells like crap, and nobody goes near it. But every now and then, that person leaves that house and hurts somebody.You cannot change radical Islam. You can only fight it.TANTAROS: Could unite Democrats and Republicans as well.BECKEL: I'll tell you something -- it's a Muslim religion that sit on top of it, and a Muslim religion that has failed consistently to step up and stand up to the plate because they're cowards. They're afraid of these Islamists, and every Muslim country out there, a pox on you.Up next --BOLLING: Well, not every Muslim country.BECKEL: Most of them.(CROSSTALK)BECKEL: You name me one Muslim country that spoke up to the Islamists. You can't because they won't do it. Cowards.A special behind-the-scenes look at the Westminster Dog Show -- that was a great follow up. The best in show will be crowned tonight. I'm sure a few Muslims will be there.Eric and Dana --PERINO: Bob --(CROSSTALK)BECKEL: -- with one of the experts on grooming.TANTAROS: Oh my God.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Where did you learn all of the grooming tips?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My parents are bred this breed for over 30 years.(CROSSTALK)(END VIDEO CLIP)BECKEL: More on Eric and Dana's canine adventure when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Tonight, the winners of seven breed categories will face off for the coveted Best in Show prize at the 138th annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. Eric and I returned again this year for a sneak peek at all the doggone excitement. Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)PERINO: Where did you learn all of the grooming tips?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My parents have bred this breed for over 40 years.BOLLING: She means you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is pretty simple.PERINO: Here's my dog. I think that Jasper is high maintenance. What do you think?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I have no idea.BOLLING: What's his name?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Vincent.PERINO: Vincent, why the long face?Has she ever had a bad hair day?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is how you protect the coat.PERINO: This is an interesting method that I am going to tell my co- hosts about, Andrea and Kimberly. Do it like this, then put their pajamas on, and in the morning, their hair will look perfect.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She lives in a castle.BOLLING: Congratulations.PERINO: Now, did you get the castle for the dog or the dog for the castle?BOLLING: Dana is so popular here. Everyone wants to talk to Dana. Meet Manny.PERINO: Hi, Manny.BOLLING: Good boy. Is he a good boy?PERINO: I just learned this, how you do a springer spaniel. So now I'm doing Eric's blow-out. And in case the whole ""Five"" thing doesn't work out, I could open up a salon.BOLLING: What's this for?PERINO: She likes to be pretty. She gets her hair and makeup done?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, yes.PERINO: We know a couple girls like that at ""The Five.""BOLLING: What do you think of the competition?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think we don't have a very good chance.BOLLING: Hey, come on. Be confident. No one said ""The Five"" would make it, either.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: True.BOLLING: This is what happens if the dog you bring here doesn't win. This isn't one of the losing dogs, is it?PERINO: If we were going to get the perfect dog for Bob Beckel, what kind of dog would it be and why?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A very big bulldog. Because it bloviates a lot and has a kind of rough jowl.PERINO: Walks kind of slow.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.PERINO: Pretends to be grumpy.BOLLING: Sleeps a lot.What's his name?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Cash.BOLLING: Cash?PERINO: You like it.BOLLING: Who let the dogs out?PERINO: Can I take a selfie with him?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sure.BOLLING: Can I photo bomb your selfie?(END VIDEOTAPE)PERINO: We had a great time there. That was at the trials just yesterday, and tonight is the finals. I'm actually going to go.And Bob, I was thinking of taking you as my date, but I didn't want Mr. Grumpy Guts with me.BECKEL: Me, Mr. Grumpy Guts?PERINO: Yes.BECKEL: Excuse me.PERINO: What do you think now? Do you like dogs a little better after that?BECKEL: No. And I want to know this. I want to know where they go to bathroom.PERINO: Outside.BECKEL: Are there fire plugs in the place?PERINO: They're house-trained. I mean, they go outside.GUTFELD: They get stuff jammed in their butts.TANTAROS: Like little plugs?GUTFELD: I thought so.TANTAROS: No.BOLLING: That's cruel. That's what I do when I go to my shows.BECKEL: Does anybody know what they pay for this crap?GUTFELD: The big story here is the mixed breeds. This is the first time in 100 years they had mixed breeds.BOLLING: Like Labradoodle and...GUTFELD: They had, like -- from the shelters.PERINO: It's a big deal.GUTFELD: We're talking about gays in the NFL. This is also big.BECKEL: I wonder what a Great Pyrenees and a miniature Beagle would be like.PERINO: Well, we can see if Photoshop can work. Andrea, have you ever been to the dog show?TANTAROS: No, but ""Best in Show"" is one of my favorite movies.PERINO: I was wondering if people who work in the dog show world, when they saw ""Best in Show,"" if they liked it.TANTAROS: They probably didn't understand it. They're like, ""So what's wrong with that?"" Remember the guy who had two left feet and who went, ""No, literally, I have two left feet""?BECKEL: Let me repeat it again. Walk the dog who fell on him and killed him in ""Best of Show.""BOLLING: We've got to go, but do you know what none of those dogs had? Their own calendar.PERINO: That's right. And the bag that was the gift bag, it did have a picture of Jasper on it, I swear. And I'm fine with that.BECKEL: I wish Jasper would come in and...PERINO: All right. ""One More Thing"" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)TANTAROS: Time for ""One More Thing."" Beck, hit it.BECKEL: OK, the president of the United States had a press conference today with the president of France, and here's the opening statement that he made.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: It is in nobody's interest to see the continuing bloodshed and collapse that's taking place inside that country.(END VIDEO CLIP)BECKEL: Mr. President, I understand exactly the problem you had, because this is the way it could have come over if I said it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: It is in nobody's interest to see the continuing bloodshed.(END VIDEO CLIP)BECKEL: OK. That's my point. OK, Mr. President. You get the swear job.GUTFELD: I think he said ""shid.""PERINO: ""Shed.""BECKEL: Oh, yes.GUTFELD: That's what you said, too, right?BECKEL: Of course, that's what I said.TANTAROS: Eric.BOLLING: So, if you really want to know what's in a politician's head, just listen to what he says when he's not on prompter.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: That's the good thing about being president. I can do whatever I want.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: ""That's the good thing about being president. I can do whatever I want."" So I guess Congress doesn't matter. They might as well pack it up and go home.PERINO: That's one of those things that your boss says that you know it's harmless, but you know it's going to be used against you. Forever.TANTAROS: Oh, yes.PERINO: He built that. Anyway.TANTAROS: Dana.PERINO: I got to go to a really cool thing last night. It was the American Song Book Gala at the Lincoln Center. I have never seen that many celebrities all in one place.But I have to hand it to the honoree, who was Brian Lord. He was Creative Artist Agency. He was just feted by everybody who said they were his best friend. I have to tell you, Anne Hathaway is amazing. She sang a song that I love. It's called, ""New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down."" It was fantastic. She was amazing.GUTFELD: That LTD Sound System.PERINO: She sang it, though.GUTFELD: How dare she ruin such a great song?PERINO: She didn't it. She sang it beautifully.TANTAROS: That's going to be the name of your Lifetime movie, if you ever would have one.PERINO: Yes. I loved it. It was a great event.TANTAROS: New York is a great (ph) town. I'm down on New York right now, too. Gregory.GUTFELD: Banned phrase. ""I owe you one."" I suddenly realized that everybody says, ""I owe you one."" It's always the same person asking for a favor, and you never get the payback. You never get the one that you're owed.PERINO: This is so true. This is absolutely true.GUTFELD: But it's always the person who says, ""I owe you one,"" and then he disappears.BOLLING: Did you notice something? Can you put the banned phrase back up? Can you still do it or not? Can you?And let Greg talk when he says it, when you put it up there. What's going on with the bottom? Was it always, like, cut off on the bottom like that?GUTFELD: I don't know.BECKEL: What the hell does that matter?TANTAROS: Maybe they're saying they owe you one, one what?GUTFELD: Yes.TANTAROS: You don't even know how they're paying you back.(CROSSTALK)BECKEL: This segment has got to get going.TANTAROS: All right. Thank you, Bob, for helping me keep time here.Listen to this.BECKEL: I had something to say about the...TANTAROS: Listen to this. The Justin Bieber statue at the wax museum -- I'm going to pretend like I didn't hear that -- has been taken away, because unfortunately, too many people have been groping the statue at Madam Tussauds here in New York City. So they're going to bring back a different one, which I don't think that's going to stop the problem unless they rope it off. But apparently, too many people were touching and fondling the statue.And Greg, they did tell me that they would let you back into the museum if you promise to be good to the...GUTFELD: Isn't it redundant having a wax figure of Justin Bieber?PERINO: You could put him in a prison suit.GUTFELD: There you go.PERINO: For the new one.BECKEL: Is everybody done? I was going to say we're being quick, but we came into this segment. It's very tight. We've got to move through very fast, and we're still burning out time here.Yes, I want to go back to the Muslims for a second. Say something, anything. Please. Say something.TANTAROS: Does anyone have a cane, anyone? Don't forget to set your DVRs so you never miss an episode of ""The Five.""
