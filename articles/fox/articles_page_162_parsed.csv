This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, AMERICAN CROSSROADS AD)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A president who skips half of his intelligence briefings but finds time to play more than 100 rounds of golf, hits the campaign trail after a U.S. ambassador is murdered in the line of duty, snubs a vital U.S. ally's request for an emergency meeting to discuss a nuclear threat while scheduling celebrity fundraisers and a ""Letterman"" appearance.The most important duty for any president is to protect our nation and its citizens. Mr. President, it's time to show up for work.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, HOST: That is the latest super PAC ad supporting Mitt Romney, the American Crossroads airing an ad trying to support Mitt Romney. This is the Friday Lightning Round, but we want to talk about the politics of this whole thing. Your choice this week, by the way, in the vote was the next foreign hot spot. We'll do it at the very end. Susan, start with you.  That ad, your reaction, and the whole politics deal?SUSAN MILLIGAN, U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT: I don't know that they want to draw attention to the reaction to this episode because it puts attention back on Mitt Romney.  The first thing I thought when I saw him give those remarks, those ill-informed and the ill-timed remarks he wanted to make this election a referendum instead of a choice. He is. He's now making a referendum on himself and his judgment. And the fact that he doubled down I think makes it worse.  That ad will shore up the base of people who already dislike Obama, but they don't need to draw attention to this. You have to be very, very careful what you say as an American --BAIER: But what -- let me -- you make good points about what many in the press have been saying over the past two days. But what about the substance of that ad about the intelligence briefings, about the president going to Vegas after the -- is there something that sticks there?MILLIGAN: Well, Romney's campaigning after this happened. I don't think anybody -- does anybody really think that Obama is not paying attention to - -CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Romney is not the president.MILLIGAN: I understand. But it's not as though -- does anybody really think that Obama is not paying attention to this crisis?KRAUTHAMMER: He is doing anything? Has he said anything?MILLIGAN: He has been saying things all day.STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: He has also been campaigning. There is this idea in press Romney is the only making political comments or campaigning or doing anything political. It's total and complete and utter nonsense. David Axelrod morning on the morning of 9/11 sent a tweet hitting Mitt Romney for his fundraising. Bill Clinton held a rally for President Obama harshly attacking Mitt Romney and Republicans on Medicare. Ben Labolt put out a statement later that night. President Obama released ad attacking Republicans on abortion on 9/11. You have the Obama trip to Las Vegas, the day after the service, the president going to the DNC. You have him e-mailing supports asking for help.This has been political the entire time. The idea that Mitt Romney is the one who is coming in and being political when the president has been doing this and the campaign has been doing this at every turn, is preposterous.MILLIGAN: The problem is this. It's being political, we all understood Governor Romney's comments for being about domestic politics. People overseas don't see it that way. And so when a prominent American gets up there and says you know this was an apology, that reinforces a very, very wrong, very misguided, somewhat irrational belief that somehow the U.S. government sanctioned a video like this. People really --HAYES: But I was an apology.MILLIGAN: It was not an apology.BAIER: Charles?KRAUTHAMMER: Why wasn't the German embassy stormed in Sudan?MILLIGAN: Because --KRAUTHAMMER: Germany wasn't involved in any way. Speaking with the mob and appeasing it won't work, especially a mobthat doesn't even know which country it should attack.The real problem here is even is looking at this through the prism of the campaign. Yes, this is an election. But American interests are on fire all over the Middle East and North Africa. And the president is absent. He hasn't spoken or explained his policy. And the press -- this is malpractice on part of press -- obsessed with one statement Romney made and not asking the president what has happened to the outreach you made at Cairo, the mutual respect, the new beginning. What is happening in the Middle East, what are you doing about it? Can you explain how your policy after three years has resulted in this catastrophe? That is a question that the president hasn't been asking. He is the president. The fact it hasn't been asked is simply astonishing.BAIER: Five seconds. Next foreign hot spot?KRAUTHAMMER: Iran/Israel. Israel now has its back to the wall. And we heard Netanyahu, it looks as if he is distressed. He may act.BAIER: A long five seconds. KRAUTHAMMER: Sorry.Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2012 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RAHM EMANUEL, D - CHICAGO MAYOR: This is a striker choice, and it's the wrong choice for our children, and it's not necessary. Totally avoidable.MICHELLE YOUNG, ACTION NOW PRESIDENT: We're going to continue to keep our children out of school until you come up with a better plan and give these teachers what they rightfully deserve.JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president has, I think, you just heard from me, has not expressed any opinion or made any assessment about this particular incident.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: 26,000 teachers and support staff in Chicago on strike, the nation's third largest school district closing its door, some 400,000 kids not in school now. The standoff continues. Here is what Paul Ryan said just a little while ago. ""We know that Rahm is not going to support our campaign, but on this issue, and on this day, we stand with Mayor Rahm Emanuel, we stand with the children, we stand with the families and the parents of Chicago because education reform, that's a bipartisan issue. Where does President Obama stand? Does he stand with his former chief of staff Mayor Rahm Emanuel, with the children and the parents, or does he stand with the union?"" We are back with the panel. A.B., what about this?A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, THE HILL: I thought it was obvious that Jay Carney was wearing the too-tight shoes look on his face today. I think Rush Limbaugh is wrong. This is not a Democratic set up so that the media can swoon and the president can rush in and rescue the deal and end the strike and help the unions. I think this is far more politically toxic for President Obama with persuadable voters than Bob Woodward's book. I think he absolutely agrees with Rahm Emanuel and is between a rock and a hard place and wants this to go away. And knows that coming out in favor of the teachers union would be a big mistake.STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: I think this is an opening for President Obama. I think if he wanted to have a big moment where he truly wanted to appeal to these swing voters that everybody is so obsessed with in these swing states, come out and say I'm for good schools. I'm for good schools no matter how we get them. I think what my chief of staff is doing in Chicago is the right thing to do. Take on these labor unions. Are they going to not organize for President Obama because he challenges them on this in his home state, in his hometown? I think not taking a position for President Obama makes him look incredibly weak. I mean this is a guy - this is his hometown, his home state and his chief of staff - his interests, I mean where his kids would have gone to school if he stayed there and he's not going to take a position?BAIER: On Wisconsin he eventually took a position.HAYES: He took a position, he didn't weigh in --BAIER: He didn't go --HAYES: -- but he took a position, right, he said he was with the unions.BAIER: Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: And that is why he is dancing around right now. Because they don't want to come out against the teachers union, which is one of the most important and powerful in the Democratic Party. You have can't go against them. It's ironic now of course, they are striking against Democratic mayors.I mean, look at where the balance of equities is here. The teachers average $76,000 a year in their salary. That is the highest of any big city in the country. Second, the average person who pays their salary, the person who pays taxes in Chicago, the average salary is $47,000. So the teachers are making 50 percent more than those who supporting them on average. They have been offered a 16 percent hike in wages at a time of high unemployment, desperation. And they turn it down. Why? Because they don't want any tampering with their health benefits, and they don't want any system of teacher evaluation so you can get some idea of who is not a good teacher. You can actually weed them out before they destroy the life of the children in their class. This is so unreasonable that the audacity with which they make their case and pretend it's for the children is simply astonishing. And that Democrats like the president have a hard time standing up for this and grab a position of steady neutrality shows you how much hostage to these unions they are.BAIER: The politics of this A.B., Rahm Emanuel did speak at the Democratic convention. He apparently left early but he is raising money for the president and the super PAC supporting the president I believe.STODDARD: He actually at the end of the convention decided to leave the campaign in his formal role to become a super PAC super poo-bah, and now because of the strike actually has stepped aside from his super PAC fundraising role because he is too busy in Chicago. Look, it is obvious that this is - if the president wants to seem in step with the public opinion and the fiscal reality, this is going to be happening - this is happening all around the country and will continue to happen even more as federal spending cuts come online and state budgets and local budgets are squeezed even further. I think it is very wimpy not to wish it away. But the reality is he is in the stranglehold that Charles speaks of -(CROSSTALK)STODDARD: -- and he doesn't know what to say.BAIER: Down the line how does this end?HAYES: I think the teachers end up having to give.BAIER: A.B.?STODDARD: I would probably bet that, too.BAIER: Charles?KRAUTHAMMER: No, I think the city will give -- they'll get a nice sweet deal, the teachers.BAIER: OK, that is it for the panel but stay tuned to see how part of the president's speech at the DNC may have one comic rethinking the 2008 campaign.Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC.
