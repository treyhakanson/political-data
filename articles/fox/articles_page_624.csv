This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" November 14, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Hello everyone. I'm Eric Bolling along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Geraldo Rivera, Melissa Francis and Brian Kilmeade. It's 5:00 in New York City and this is ""The Five.""President Obama just wrapped up his first news conference since Donald Trump became president-elect and the outgoing commander-in-chief had a lot of useful advice for the incoming commander-in-chief ranging topics crucial like details surrounding our nuclear response, NATO and job creation.And then Mr. Obama got into some of the politics too, making recommendations about carbon emissions, wind and solar power and the minimum wage. The president began by telling Democrats to basically get over it, Trump won, blame yourselves for your loss.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The people have spoken. Donald Trump will be the next president, the 45th president of the United States. Those who didn't vote for him have to recognize that that's how democracy works. When I won, there were a number of people who didn't like me and didn't like what I stood for.I think that whenever you've got an incoming president of the other side, particularly in a bitter election like this, it takes a while for people to reconcile themselves with that new reality.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: And the mainstream media hasn't come to terms with the people's decision. Here is ABC's Martha Raddatz's line of questioning?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARTHA RADDATZ, CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT, ABC NEWS: Does anything concern you about a Trump presidency?OBAMA: Do I have concerns, absolutely. Of course I've got concerns. He and I differ on a whole bunch of issues. But the federal government and our democracy is not a speed boat. It's an ocean liner.RADDATZ: Do you still have any concern about his temperament?OBAMA: There are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well unless he recognizes them and corrects them.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right KG, I was going to say the president looked relaxed and he should. He is now -- he's (INAUDIBLE) the president, but I want to stay on that for a second. Martha Raddatz, after she didn't get the answer she was looking for the first time, but aren't you really concerned about Trump being president? Come on, aren't you?KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Yes, she kept trying to like poke the cage but he wasn't going to take the bait. But he did he sound somewhat subdued and not his usual, you know, boisterous (inaudible) self. And I think it's probably hitting him but in fact now his legacy is going to be on the line because there are no guarantees. He tried to hand over the reins to Hillary Clinton. He made his best effort, put it forward and so did his wife, the First Lady and it fell short.BOLLING: Melissa, I heard you kind of whispering during that first sound bite talking about, you know, Obama basically say hey, Democrats, you lost this. It's on you, but you think it was --MELISSA FRANCIS, GUEST CO-HOST: I think it was a little more specific than that. I mean he started out with this idea because of the changing demographics in the country and I thought, oh gosh, here we go, you know,, with the Electoral College. He said you got to be everywhere. The reason why I won Iowa twice is because I was there 287 times, and he said you got to keep campaigning, you got to go everywhere. And I was like, wow.He is basically saying that she didn't try hard enough. That she didn't campaign hard enough. I mean is the argument that the Trump campaign that we heard, you know, wasn't organized, maybe didn't have any ground game, was more organized than the Clinton machine? That's what it sounded like.BOLLING: Or was the message also flawed, too? It mostly points out the -- maybe Donald Trump did hit the Midwest a little bit harder than she did and maybe she lost because of it. But what about the message?GERALDO RIVERA, CO-HOST: I thought that President Obama was terrific. I thought his tone was very conciliatory. He mentioned the bitterness and ferocity of the campaign and yet juxtaposed it with the cordiality of the meeting he had with the president-elect.He was very respectful to Donald Trump and to the American people's decision. He mobilized Donald Trump a ton of Americans and I think President Obama recognized that there is a movement that has taken place and you have to deal with it.BOLLING: Brian, he threw in politics. You know, whether the advice you have for the incoming president, he went through NATO, he went through nuclear responses, and then he started with the carbon footprints and the emissions and wind and solar power, and then he went to minimum wage. These are hard core Democrat issues.BRIAN KILMEADE, GUEST CO-HOST: Yes, at first he said, yes, before you unwind Paris keep in mind and then fill in the blanks. First of all, that wasn't a reprimand on Melissa for her whispering during the sound bite.(LAUGHTER)KILMEADE: I just want to make that clear. So do not feel bad.FRANCIS: I was a little worried.KILMEADE: Because I took it wrong too for a while. Now I'm over it. But I do say this, I agree with Geraldo. I loved his tone today. I loved the fact that he went out of his way to not insult anything that I could tell of anyone except Hillary Clinton because when he said you didn't go, he goes, I had to go to the fish fries, I had to go here and I had to go there. The problem is and I'd assume just to say he didn't insert politics to a degree.But you know what he's doing and I know you know this Eric. He said it. He told you what he's doing. He says he's not someone who's got -- he's not an ideologue. He's not dug in on policies. We think he's more pragmatic than that. He is saying that he might be pliable. He might be somebody that when he calls me up, I could try to get him to -- I could win him over to a degree. So if he alienates...BOLLING: He being Trump?KILMEADE: Being Trump. But I will say this. You know, he went out of his way I thought to do things that he hasn't done in the past. He told in Japan he says he is afraid that, you know, Trump does not have the knowledge of Europe, Asia and the Middle East. He went out of his way and he thinks he is woefully unprepared he said in Singapore. And that is why so many people around the world are saying, wow, the current president thinks his nominee is unprepared. What are we in for?BOLLING: And KG, he did take another I would call a bit of a shot when he said that, you know, interesting sound bites or provocative (ph) sound bites don't necessarily turn into good policy.GUILFOYLE: OK, yes. I mean, it's a veiled, you know, shot but we can figure it out. We got the decoder. So, he is saying listen, it sounded good, let's see if these are actually policies that can be implemented that are going to bring about the change that has been promised in this election by the president-elect Donald Trump. Nevertheless, tread carefully, because this is the man that's holding your legacy in his hands. I mean to be honest, right. I mean President Obama is very charming.KILMEADE: Maybe that translates into the why he's not insulting him and going out of his way.GUILFOYLE: Exactly because he doesn't want -- he wants there not to be, you know, Obamacare repealed and replaced. The whole thing about leaving two aspects of it in but the Republicans were going to that anyway. He is worried about -- all of these different things he's done, all of the executive orders. I mean, it's like Donald Trump's the big thing as like, you know, liquid paper and just going to erase what he did. Magic marker eraser.FRANCIS: On the eve of going on this tour around the world where he is supposed to be reassuring people that President Trump isn't anything to be afraid of, I don't think that's what Trump wants. He wants people off balance. It's like a new boss coming into a company. You're saying, you know what, guess what, everybody be on notice. There's a new boss.RIVERA: I think you are burying the lead. The lead to me is the fact that President Obama praised president-elect Trump's connection powerful, connection with the majority of the American people, that he's the majority (INAUDIBLE) in the electorate.KILMEADE: Yes. He said he was impressed with his victory.RIVERA: He was very impressed with his victory.FRANCIS: Hard not to be.RIVERA: He is impressed with the job that Trump did business (ph). Historic job in getting this powerful connection. Those are powerful words.BOLLING: This is the guy who about 10 days or so ago said Donald Trump is unfit to hold the presidency.RIVERA: Well, 15 days ago Donald Trump said he was born in Kenya.BOLLING: Well, I'm not sure about that. At one point he did say -- this isn't constitutional, this transition of power isn't in the constitution but we do have --RIVERA: It's in the cordiality.BOLLING: Well, the outgoing president takes the time and gets the incoming president, the commander-in-chief up to speed on things like NATO and --GUILFOYLE: It's not mandated.KILMEADE: You know what, I love the fact that President Bush set the template for this.GUILFOYLE: Yes.KILMEADE: He refers to President Bush all the time --GUILFOYLE: Which I like.KILMEADE: ...because he's the guy who got -- became president for by insulting President Bush's Iraq war, and when they finally met, you thought there would be tension. Bush was above it -- Bush 43, and he's been above it for eight years since. And he keeps saying the standards set by President Bush during that transition is something I look to emulate. It's really hard to shake it because he's in his 50s. He's got 30 more years to look back at his legacy and this transition has a lot to do with his legacy.BOLLING: His policies is about to be dismantled. I mean, you know, other than that, it's three to four years, what will remain? Take Obamacare.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Hold that for one second. Hold Obamacare for one second. Give me another legacy item. Everything else is by executive fiat.FRANCIS: I will.BOLLING: Donald Trump said the first thing he's going to do is dismantle all the executive orders.RIVERA: If President Trump --GUILFOYLE: Climate change.RIVERA: Climate change also. It was flooded in Miami Beach if anyone noticed yesterday.KILMEADE: Because that is not proven to be climate change.RIVERA: Yeah, right.GUILFOYLE: I was being facetious.RIVERA: It's, you know, the super, super duper moon. Actually my cab driver today told me a great thing. He said, you know what the super moon was? That was Donald Trump for the Democrats giving them a super moon. I think that when you can take --KILMEADE: I just got that. It took me a while.RIVERA: Immigration. President Obama pleaded with president-elect Trump today not to throw out the Dream Act students. The students have been given this temporary deferral from deportation because they were brought here as small children, committed no crimes. They are basically American children. What President Obama was doing to me today was pleading with President Trump. Please sir, OK.FRANCIS: No. I totally disagree. When he said -- he made that one point. He said, I think that you find when I turn over the keys that the car is in pretty good shape. I think he was out there making the case for why -- for his legacy. I mean he went through thing after thing. He said, you know when I inherited the presidency, you know, everything was falling apart, the wheels were coming off, the economy was in shambles.RIVERA: Which is all true, all true.FRANCIS: And he would on and on, and he would try to talk about how, yes -- I know people aren't totally happy what what's going on, but we still did a great job. When he's going back and forth between trying to recognize that there's a huge portion of Americans like you said who are very unhappy with what's going on and they all came out to vote.But at the same time, arguing why his presidency wasn't that great. We should be looking back at it and saying he did a great job when in fact the electorate just said, no you didn't.KILMEADE: He also said no major scandals. He also said no major scandals that happened. I mean people look at him and they don't look at him as fundamentally dishonest but they do look at the IRS. They do look at a lot of different things that happened during that time where there was no hell to pay for it and then people -- and also he brought the VA which I think is a dangerous thing for him to bring up. He says look, we have so many people, you know, we had a problem in Phoenix but we have so many other people, it happens. That's a tough thing to reconcile.BOLLING: We're going to tease KG though. He's going to have his pile of executive orders this high on his desk, Donald Trump will day one to start repealing every single -- dismantling every one of them. I think...GUILFOYLE: It's a lot go through and I think that's something and he's really talked about government waste and overregulation and you know, the power of the executive pen being you know, misused and abused essentially during this past eight years of the administration so, I don't know. Make all your big plans.BOLLING: We'll do this. We have a lot more to talk about. Coming up, Obamacare, the Supreme Court, abortion, same-sex marriage, new remarks from the president-elect on all of these important issues to America when ""The Five"" returns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Big change is coming and it's coming when president-elect Trump takes the oath of office in January. One of the first items on his agenda, repealing Obamacare. He does seem open, however, to leaving parts of the law in place. Here is Mr. Trump in his first televised interview since winning the White House.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LESLIE STAHL, JOURNALIST CBS NEWS: When you replace it, are you going to make sure that people with preconditions are still covered?DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT: Yes, because it happens to be one of the strongest assets.STAHL: You're going to keep it?TRUMP: Also with children living with their parents for an extended period.STAHL: You're going to keep that?TRUMP: We're not going to very much try and keep that in.We're not going to have a two-year period where there's nothing. It will be repealed and replaced and we'll know and it will be great health care for much less money.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: OK. We talked about this answer before. Sorry, Brian, your compliment to me wasn't good enough.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: you know, and we went at this sort of the better part of five and a half years. So, Donald Trump took the two things out of Obamacare that was the most palatable for Republicans, which is pre-existing conditions. If you have a pre-existing condition, you can get healthcare and you can stay on your parents, a policy until you're 26. Those are the two that probably would have ended up in the replacement plan anyway. He's also talked about selling insurance across state lines.GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: That's a big one, and then one other, just remove the mandate. Once you remove a mandate where everyone has to purchase insurance, you allow competition to come in and that's what drops prices. President Obama is wrong today. He was literally wrong today. He said single payer -- a single payer system would be better to bring prices down. It won't.Single payer allows prices to go up. They'll go as high as government are willing to pay and if you know anything about government, they're willing to overpay on everything. So, he's close in, for all I know, it could still be Obamacare but it won't look anything like Obamacare.KILMEADE: You think they'd call it Obamacare?BOLLING: No.FRANCIS: There's a huge difference though if you listen closely to what he was saying. I mean he was saying that kids can stay on their parent's insurance plan and the pre-existing conditions. He didn't say he won't pay for that. I mean that's the problem with Obamacare, is they have to take you with pre-existing conditions and they can't charge you more where somebody has to pay for patients who are using more healthcare.He didn't say it will cost the same. You can leave those things in place if you have to pay for them. Also, I really just -- the idea of introducing more competition. Now, the president in the meantime went on the air in his speech and he said, well, it's going to be hard, you know, the holy grail for the Republicans has been Obamacare. Now they're going to see when you try and replace it how hard it is. I disagree.We've watched exactly where it fails, where it doesn't make mathematical sense. You could sit down and write a program today. Call me, I'll help you. That would replace it in a second.RIVERA: They should call you because they've been unable to write one in that period since. I agree with Eric 100 percent in terms of...GUILFOYLE: Finally.RIVERA: Finally, interstate sales of insurance. The only reason insurance sales are restricted by state is the lobby -- the insurance lobbies within the state. When you have interstate commerce, when the person in California can buy it from an insurance company in Delaware or...FRANCIS: Amen.BOLLING: Let me blow your mind even further.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: ...one single payer system has this and Republicans is saying, come up with a single payer system. Give a government alternative, but don't mandate the government alternative and don't mandate insurance. If you give the government alternative, that's more competition.GUILFOYLE: Right. Brian Kilmeade, cleanup for ""The Five"" but lead off the Fox...KILMEADE: Yes, cleanup on a five-man team is not good. Am I right? But let me just say we (INAUDIBLE). I made a tactical error. I opened up today with Ezekiel Emanuel at 7:20. I did this thing called having tryout (ph) in normal conversation with someone who wakes up yelling. So I thought, since the election is over, I'm mad (ph) because he's one of the authors and founders of Obamacare.I thought we'd have a conversation. So he starts yelling right away but I realized you lost the election. But he said this, he said three states already are allowed to trade across lines and he says they haven't. They chose not to. Number two he says, if you go 26 years old and you go the other thing that everyone likes which is...FRANCIS: Pre-existing conditions.KILMEADE: Pre-existing conditions, you got to find someone to pay for it. Hence, Eric, comes all the taxes. The medical device tax making healthy people pay a fine or go do it. You have to have some way to balance it out. So where is the revenue coming from to make up for these new previsions that people are going to beg to Trump?FRANCIS: You have to pay more if you have a pre-existing condition. Before you couldn't get insurance --KILMEADE: A lot of people don't want that. If you have a pre-existing condition --FRANCIS: You got to pay for what you're using.KILMEADE: So if you're born with a club foot, you should pay more?FRANCIS: If you use more health insurance, you have to pay for it. Someone has to. That is the bottomline.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: How about this? He gets his say. The president-elect also weighed in on some hot button social issues including abortion. He said in the past he would appoint Supreme Court justices who might overturn Roe v. Wade. Leslie Stahl asked him about that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I'm pro life. The judges will be pro life and they'll be...STAH: But what about overturning this law?TRUMP: You know there are a couple of things. They will be pro life.If it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states. So, it would go back to the states --STAHL: Some women won't be able to get an abortion.TRUMP: No, it will go back to the states.STAHL: By state. Now some --TRUMP: They'll perhaps have to go to another state.STAHL: And that's okay?TRUMP: Well, we'll see what happens. It's got a long way to go just so you understand. That has a long, long way to go.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Good answer. Now, Mr. Trump also addressed his position on same- sex marriage.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STAHL: Do you support marriage equality?TRUMP: It's irrelevant because it was already settled. It's law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean it's done.STAHL: So even if you appoint a judge --TRUMP: It's done. You have these cases have gone to the Supreme Court. They have been settled and I'm fine with that.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right, so very interesting. I see you. I feel the comment from this side. I know. Go ahead.RIVERA: How is it that the same-sex marriage can be settled law because the Supreme Court ruled it is and Roe v. Wade is unsettled? I submit to you that Roe v. Wade and all the subsequent cases make very clear that the Supreme Court of the United States has ruled essentially that the unborn child remains part of the mother's body until the unborn child can exist on its own.That's the essence of Roe v. Wade. I think that as technology makes that period shorter and shorter, the cases might -- there may be along the -- like a late-term abortion where it can be ruled...GUILFOYLE: Yes, partial birth abortion.RIVERA: Partial birth and so forth. Maybe the Supreme Court can say that that's only permissible when the life of the mother -- maybe something like that. But I have no doubt that not just in my lifetime but you kids as well will not see Roe v. Wade being overturned.KILMEADE: He doesn't know that. I mean he's not a lawyer. So I mean there are again a lot of legal questions and political questions and legislative questions he just not going to be able to answer because this is not where he spent the bulk of his life for 50 years. He is buying buildings and making them.RIVERA: He's also been pro choice for most of his life that I've known him.KILMEADE: Right.GUILFOYLE: Well he campaigned, Eric, as pro life and he said to me here very clearly, he said it would go back to the states. A lot of the people where there is fear mongering that were, you know, for Hillary Clinton and saying that he's going to overturn and overrule, you know, Roe v. Wade. What he did say for sure is that he was going to appoint conservative justices and that he was looking to find justices that were similar to Justice Antonin Scalia.BOLLING: Who was there, who was on the bench and never attempted to overturn Roe v. Wade, right.RIVERA: And he's a strict and very conservative.BOLLING: Yes, absolutely. So I think this fear mongering of oh, now Donald Trump is president, he's going to stack the bench with ultra conservative pro-lifers and Roe v. Wade is going to get flipped, I doubt it. He didn't seem to have an appetite for that. Look at everything he said. Yes, he's pro life and that's the way he campaigned, but it's not one of those issues that he says I have to change this. I haven't heard him once say that.KILMEADE: What about Ted Cruz? I'd say Ted Cruz would be the perfect substitute. Lindsey Graham put his name into the fray today.GUULFOYLE: (INAUDIBLE)FRANCIS: I don't know. I mean it does seem like we're so far down this road. I'm not a lawyer but I certainly support a strict construction view of the constitution. I don't like expanding things along the way. But I mean it sounds like, like you said, we're just so far down this road, I don't know how you send it back --RIVERAL: How do you overrule 30 Supreme Court decisions? I don't know.GUILFOYLE: We know she likes the second amendment, ""Guns on the Prairie."" My favorite show.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: All right next, can the mainstream media be trusted to report fairly on president-elect Trump when outlets are admitting one by one that they botched their coverage of the former GOP nominee? Coming up on ""The Five"" and lots more.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)FRANCIS: The mainstream media dismissed GOP nominee Donald Trump and the tens of millions of Americans who wanted to see dramatic change in Washington. They blew it. And some organizations are actually now admitting it, which is refreshing. ""The New York Times"" says it will now rededicate itself to honest reporting after Mr. Trump's victory. Rededicate? Honest reporting? Newt Gingrich has this advice for all those Americans who want fair and balanced, unbiased coverage on their president-elect.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Let me just start and say that everybody who was for Donald Trump and everybody who wants Donald Trump to succeed should cue off the mainstream media. If the mainstream media hates something, it's probably a really good idea. I mean let's be clear that they are the mortal opponents of what Trump is trying to achieve.(END VIDEO CLIP)FRANCIS: Brian, so, to be fair, ""The New York Times,"" when I called and canceled my subscription some years back, I said -- they said why. Yes, they said why -- I've done it three times actually. And I said because of your biased reporting. They go, oh, we have a box for that. I wasn't the only one.KILMEADE: Well they're correct. They just put a box there. For one thing, I find the whole thing flat out amazing that they would admit they made this type of mistake. But yet if you read ""The New York Times"" even today, they haven't really backed off that mistake at all. Number two is, if ""The New York Times"" feels like it should change their ways, what about the ""New York Daily News?"" That was a comic book for the last five months. They actually made -- they would just sit there and write negative stories and make it up out of thin air. Why that's still even a publication? I don't even know.FRANCIS: I mean on those publications, we knew it like ""The Post"" and ""The Daily News,"" you know, I mean they knew who their fan base is. We kind of like highlight the stories that they know their folks are going to like. ""The New York Times,"" I mean they are supposed to be playing it straight but they haven't been for a long time.RIVERA: I think the New York Post, Daily News, you can also say, dare I say it, FOX News and MSNBC, we clearly have a slant one way or the other. It doesn't mean we change the facts. It doesn't mean we misreport. But we have a conservative bent, and MSNBC has a liberal bent.CNN is supposed to be right in the middle. They were not right in the middle. They tilted to Hillary Clinton. The New York Times is...FRANCIS: Tilted? They were giving her debate questions.RIVERA: ... the paragon of journalistic virtue, and they really became a propaganda arm of the Democratic Party as did The Washington Post. They admitted it. The Washington Post assigned 20 of their best reporters to find dirt on Donald Trump, so every day he woke up knowing that the best investigative reporters at The Washington Post and the best at The New York Times were looking for dirt on him every day.KILMEADE: And Ivana Trump backs you up. She says she got countless offers to give up the divorce papers, open up the divorce papers of Donald Trump, from The New York Times.GUILFOYLE: Yes.RIVERA: Ivana, not Ivanka.KILMEADE: Did I say Ivanka?RIVERA: Yes. Ivana is the ex-wife.FRANCIS: K.G.GUILFOYLE: That's right. There were a lot of people that were approached. I know many of them that were approached to try to give over information. And then I said, ""Mm, mm, mm, not nice."" You know, and it's bad. They were trying to do it, and they were working overtime to try to destroy one candidate's credibility and chances of the presidency and bootstrap someone else.And despite their best, most duplicit [SIC] efforts -- duplicitous, probably better -- they weren't able to succeed. And -- but that tells you something about the strength of our democracy and the movement that was afoot. I think it's pretty compelling. And do you think you should trust them at this point? No.FRANCIS: Yes. President-elect Trump and his transition team have been hard at work selecting key members of the new administration. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus was tapped to be Mr. Trump's chief of staff. He spoke about the honor earlier on ""FOX and Friends.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)AINSLEY EARHARDT, CO-HOST, ""FOX & FRIENDS"": What was that moment like when he asked you to be the chief of staff? How did it all go down?REINCE PRIEBUS, RNC CHAIR/INCOMING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Well, I mean, it was very -- it was surreal, but it was also one of these things where a huge burden is put on your shoulders. And that was the instant feeling. But I want do him proud. But most importantly, he wants to do the American people proud.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Good answer.BOLLING: I wanted to make sure we got this, because Reince Priebus was a great choice. So was -- Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon, those were the two leading contenders for chief of staff.Chief of staff is the one who handles the -- what the president sees, what hits the president's desk. Extremely important.And we pointed out yesterday in the live show that, because Reince is so close with Paul Ryan, both from Wisconsin...GUILFOYLE: Right, work well with Congress.BOLLING: ... he's establishment, RNC, this is a great olive branch to at least the people in D.C. I know he's going to drain the swamp, and he will. But this is great, at least for a while, to keep the transition going -- going forward.But I want to point out something that's been going on all day. And it's a coordinated effort by the media to trash Steve Bannon, and it's not right. This is a guy with military service. He was an officer in the Navy for a number of years. He's a Harvard and Georgetown graduate. The man is smart. He's a businessman.GUILFOYLE: And was a star.BOLLING: He's a very, very smart man. Good patriot and also a great, great compliment to Reince Priebus as having -- one in each of Donald Trump's ears.KILMEADE: I thought for four months he's done an incredible job. And he's the only one who can stare down Donald Trump and get him to react, evidently, behind the scenes. You need that balance.FRANCIS: Can he distance himself from the comments that have been made on Breitbart? I mean, that brings back to...RIVERA: Why not? He's not an anti-Semite.GUILFOYLE: Why not? He helped get him, you know, to the finish line and was a chief strategist on the campaign. Maybe America wants some of those winning thoughts and ideas to get us across the finish line.KILMEADE: Can I ask something to Geraldo? Permission granted, Melissa?FRANCIS: Of course.KILMEADE: Geraldo, I just -- I have to counter what you said about an ideological bent. When you consider that Donald Trump was so mad at this channel in particular, I just was writing this down -- Steven H., George Will, Bill Kristol was on with Brit Hume for a while. That's just off the top of my head of people who were against his candidacy, up until the last day, including the myriad of guests we had on here, and...RIVERA: Are you asking me to defend FOX News right now?KILMEADE: Yes. No, I'm defending FOX News.RIVERA: I love FOX News. I think -- FOX News has me on it. I am the fair and balanced.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.RIVERA: You didn't see much of me during the election campaign, admittedly. I thought Hannity led the charge for President-elect Trump. And I think that Hannity -- I thought Hannity was crazy, he was so obsessed with getting the president-elect elected. But it turns out Hannity was the only person in the entire country who got it right.BOLLING: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!GUILFOYLE: Why are you disrespecting?FRANCIS: We have to go.GUILFOYLE: Bolling, fight him. No-holds-barred.BOLLING: No, you cannot tease yet. I'm not going to take that. The B.S. I took for a year and a half.GUILFOYLE: Yes.BOLLING: And you took for a year and a half. That is just -- all right, let's go.FRANCIS: Are you done? OK.Next, our good friend Tucker joins us, maybe. Did you hear his brand-new show ""Tucker Carlson Tonight""...GUILFOYLE: I heard that.FRANCIS: ... premieres at 7 p.m. Eastern? Stay tuned for a preview from Tucker himself. It's coming up. Look at that hair.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(MUSIC: ROD STEWART, ""TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT"")KILMEADE: All right. Special thanks to Rod Stewart for going down just at the right time. Thank you very much, Rod.Remember this day, November 14, 2016. It's going down in history as the day Tucker Carlson premieres his brand-new show starting at -- soon at 7 p.m. right here on the FOX News Channel. ""Anything could happen"" is his catch phrase. The star of ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" named before he was named as host, Tucker, congratulations on getting the show. Are you going to go through with this?TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: None of that is in script. You've never read a script in your life. Everything is ad lib.KILMEADE: I added a few things, a little bit. But Tucker, how excited are you? I know you've been through this before. But how excited are you right now?CARLSON: I'm totally excited, because the context of it. I mean, it's not just a TV show. It's a reaction against what we just saw in the past year and a half, which is the press falling down in its basic obligation, which is to be a watchdog against people with your money and power over you. And they decided that they identify more strongly with certain politicians than with their readers or viewers. It's, like, all falling apart.And so I hope to just recapture some of the basics like, you know, challenge people on their power. Pierce pomposity, crush smugness. Just like the normal things you're supposed to do if you're a journalist, no?KILMEADE: No, Melissa doesn't think it will work. Why?FRANCIS: My big thing is, are you dancing? I mean, it's very important at the beginning and at the end. Will there be some twirls or where there be any dancing?CARLSON: No. Not only am I not dancing, I'm entirely stationary. Unlike ""FOX and Friends,"" there's a barrier, a safety barrier in front of me, so you cannot see my lower half. I'm totally comfortable; there's a back on my chair. I'm really in my natural habitat now.FRANCIS: Sounds like a dream.CARLSON: It is a dream, actually.RIVERA: Sounds like an excuse to wear Bermuda shorts to work.Will you have Paul Begala? Will it have that kind of confrontation? Will it have -- you know, what will make it different than the ?CARLSON: I'm looking at my booking sheet here, and there's a roaming correspondent from the FOX News Channel, I think, on later this week. Mr. Geraldo, ladies and gentlemen.No, I mean, what's going to make it different? A couple of things. If you're doing a show in Washington, it's pretty -- at least if you're me, it's pretty hard to get context on what's happening in the rest of country. But this last year has, I think, shined a light on what's happening.There's this huge and massive and terrible disconnect between the governed and the governing. And to sort of explain to the people here -- not just people at home but the people here what the rest of the country is thinking, I think, would be great service. And I hope to provide it.FRANCIS: Wow.KILMEADE: Go ahead, Eric.BOLLING: I was just wondering, so we've gone through probably the most -- followed, the highest rated election in history.CARLSON: Yes.BOLLING: Once the political theater calms down, what do you pivot to?CARLSON: Are you kidding? I mean, politicians are not the only people in power.What was so interesting about this last election was it wasn't just Hillary Clinton. It wasn't just the political class. It was everybody in the tech establishment. It was almost everyone in big business, everyone in finance. Everyone in the media, Hollywood, academia. I mean, sort of every power center in American life was aligned on the same side of the question.And it sort of -- it shows you, like, who's kind of running things. And, look, I'm no revolutionary. I'm not even much of a populist. I've lived here all my life, but I do think that people who are affecting your lives ought to have to answer pretty straightforward questions about what they're doing. And so we're going to do that.KILMEADE: In my opinion, one of the reasons you got the show is because no matter how bad things get, you always seem to have a positive light on it. You're approachable. You will accept another argument. And you'll let people talk. That's part of the gift.The problem is, you don't have a woman in the middle and another guy on the other side. You're used to being on the couch. It's just Tucker, no women. Just Tucker.GUILFOYLE: He's going to rely on the guests for that.CARLSON: I'm going to have to take up the whole charm piece myself, which could be a huge problem. Thanks for rattling my confidence, Brian.KILMEADE: Here's a woman for you.GUILFOYLE: Here's a woman. And I'll be with you to help out with the -- you know, the other chromosome, the other side, on Wednesday. I thank you for asking me for that.CARLSON: Are you kidding, K.G.?GUILFOYLE: I love the haircut. I think it's fantastic.FRANCIS: It is very sharp.GUILFOYLE: I'm very happy for you.CARLSON: Wouldn't you invest money with me? I'm not some kind of reefer (ph) revolutionary now.FRANCIS: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Yes, you look very clean cut. All American.CARLSON: Totally.GUILFOYLE: Absolutely. And congratulations. And as you know, you're working with one of the best staffs in television.CARLSON: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Amazing producers and super talented, Justin and everybody there. So I know it's going to be a big success.RIVERA: What about bow ties?CARLSON: I appreciate your confidence.GUILFOYLE: Bow ties? I don't think he's going to.CARLSON: Oh, come on, now!GUILFOYLE: He's beyond that now.CARLSON: It's a new world.GUILFOYLE: This is the new Tucker.KILMEADE: Kreskin, can I just talk to Kreskin? He predicts a big success. In fact, he guarantees it.CARLSON: I hope so. Can you thank him for me?KILMEADE: Listen, and don't go on a delay. We're taking you live, Tucker. We can't take it.FRANCIS: Good advice.CARLSON: You don't -- you don't trust me to do that. But thank you, Brian.KILMEADE: Listen, you have huge fans. You have earned everyone's loyalty. Thanks so much, Tucker. Best of luck. I'm going to try to get cable and watch you at home.GUILFOYLE: And what will happen to ""FOX & Friends"" now?KILMEADE: All right. I guess I'm going to go now. I can't actually go until they left the two shot. Now I can officially go.""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" at 7 p.m. Be watching. Go get them, Tucker. How do you like that? I read the prompter.Hey, coming up straight ahead, it's 16 minutes before the top of the hour. President Obama spent a lot of time at Martha's Vineyard playing golf throughout his two terms. President-elect Trump sees himself vacationing in office. Here to explain why he's a workaholic and how that will be the best thing to ever happen to our country.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)RIVERA: President-elect Trump, as you know, folks, has some very nice vacation properties. I mean, some gorgeous places. He says, though, he will not be going on vacation much after he moves into the White House. He also won't be making much either, as he explained on ""60 Minutes"" last night.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: There's so much work to be done, and I want to get it done for the people. I want to get it done. So I don't think we will be very big on vacations. No.LESLIE STAHL, ""60 MINUTES"": Are you going to take the salary, the president's salary?TRUMP: Well, I've never commented on this but the answer is no. I think I have to by law take $1, so I'll take $1 a year. But it's a -- I don't even know what it is. Do you know what the salary is?STAHL: $400,000 you're giving up.TRUMP: I'm not going to take the salary. I'm not taking it.(END VIDEOTAPE)RIVERA: So how does the capitalist feel about him not taking a salary? Why are you so mad at me?BOLLING: OK, we'll leave it at that. I'm, like, actually thinking about taking you up on your offer from the summer right after the show.So brilliant. Brilliant move on his part. Take the dollar.RIVERA: Don't take the salary?BOLLING: Don't take the salary. Take the dollar. Don't go on the long vacations. I mean, look, he's 70 years old. He's lived a wonderful life. He's traveled the globe 100,000 times. This is what he wanted to do. He wanted to come and make the country great again, and he's going to it. And he's starting the right way.And by the way, he also mentioned term limits in that ""60 Minutes"" special last night. Wow, that was huge. If that's not a signal to draining the swamp, nothing is.GUILFOYLE: Yes, exactly. Express Drain-o here it comes. Yes.RIVERA: First on the not taking the salary, sometimes in small things you make a big message.And what do you think about term limits?GUILFOYLE: I think -- I think number one, I think it's great that he's not going to take the salary. Good for him. Because he's just trying to do this job, he said, as part of this movement. It's about us. We have no choice. We have to win. So he is not going to try and be taking from the honey pot already, because he's going to cut back and reduce regulation and try and create jobs and stimulate the economy and not take some from the till to begin with. Good for him.As for term limits, sure, absolutely. People get, like, too comfortable in their position, too cozy with all the lobbyists. Eliminate that and let them focus on their jobs. They're in and then they're out.KILMEADE: Lack of balance in life is the American way. He's a workaholic who needs no sleep. That's who we want.We've seen these big problems, and we find out the president is golfing, somebody else is at Camp David. Other times in the past, you know, whether it's Crawford -- and you think to yourself, I know the White House moves, but I'd rather you be in the Oval Office.You're not going to have a problem with the guy who just outworked 16 people on the Republican side and then Hillary Clinton, he blew her away, in terms of pure work ethic. I love it.We're not talking about what else he said. He said about the Trump name and about it being suffering, who cares? Meanwhile, all the kids almost passed out. Who cares? They have a business to run. They've go places to fill. Ivanka has got blouses to sell.GUILFOYLE: Yes, but you know what? He knows that they're highly capable, and they're going to be able to carry it. Like they held...(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: Can we go back...KILMEADE: Are you yelling at me, Kimberly?GUILFOYLE: Because they're so talented.FRANCIS: First of all -- OK, first of all, you socialist, take the money and give it to charity. No. That's redistributing taxpayer dollars. That's what we're trying to get away from. He's saying stop. Stop with the money. Hang onto it, first of all.Second of all, I know you're asking the question about the Trump kids.RIVERA: The Trump brand.FRANCIS: I was looking at this earlier today, because it's hard. I mean, he's going to be under a microscope. Is he doing anything that benefits the Trump brand? He can separate himself from the business and leave his kids in charge. But we wouldn't have been happy if Chelsea Clinton had been left in charge of the foundation and it had continued to exist.So I do think a lot of people are going to be looking at the brand and what happens and if they benefit from it. It's going to be a tough one.RIVERA: Has it been damaged?FRANCIS: No.GUILFOYLE: They've been running it already and doing things.RIVERA: It has not been damaged?FRANCIS: Damaged? Please.KILMEADE: Temporarily it has.Are you kidding? It's bigger than ever.RIVERA: Most of the people who voted for him are not Trump clients.FRANCIS: I don't think...RIVERA: ""One More Thing"" is next.GUILFOYLE: His kids have already been running it to begin with.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: All right. Time for ""One More Thing."" What's up, K.G.?GUILFOYLE: Well, there was big news today, especially in the world of journalism, because renowned journalist, well-respected Gwen Ifill passed away at the age of 61. You will remember that she is an award-winning television journalist for NBC and PBS, former reporter for The New York Times and author of the book ""The Break-through Politics and Race in the Age of Obama,"" which was published on inauguration day in 2009.And even most recently, she moderated a debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.So this is someone who also worked for The Washington Post, covering Congress, presidential campaigns and national political conventions. And she will be missed. She passed away from cancer, sadly.And also, I just want to let you guys know, I'm going to have some pictures and updates tomorrow, because my favorite charity, near and dear to my heart, that I'm on the Children's Counsel, the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. We're hosting our annual gala tonight. And I will be the -- what is it, mistress of ceremonies?BOLLING: Very nice. Very nice.GUILFOYLE: So more on that tomorrow. You can check on my Facebook page.BOLLING: All right. OK, so I wanted to do one more white board. And I know I said I was going to stop. One more, because you remember everyone said Donald Trump was winning because of white men. That's who were voting for Donald Trump. I'm about to blow liberals' minds apart right now.GUILFOYLE: Again?BOLLING: Let's go through the demographics. First, there's 2012. On gender, he's up on the males by 5 percent but only down with woman by 1 percent versus 2012.Then go to race. He's up whites 1 percent. But he was much higher, his increase among the black community was 7 percent. Hispanic community by 8 percent. So he actually trailed the black and Hispanic communities in increase.And how about this? Age, 18 to 29 years old, he had a 5 percent increase over 2012. And the older set, 65 and older, down for Donald Trump.And how about income? Under $30,000, people voted for him 16 percent higher than Mitt Romney. And you go to the higher income bracket, he actually lost ground with the higher income brackets.And the politics. Five percent increase among Democrats. Republicans 4 percent. And 1 percent among independents. That proves he won, versus 2012, across all demographics.FRANCIS: Did Rone (ph) say it was it OK if you did that?BOLLING: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Because his is the Right Board.BOLLING: OK, Brian. You're up.KILMEADE: All right. So I've got to tell you, I had a chance to go to The Villages over the weekend. And who did I see as a poster in the window? It's Dana Perino and Jasper are going to be there next week. So there I have, America, you have to make your choice. Boy, don't I look fashionable? I forgot to bring a sweater. Wearing my shirt out, I think that's a bigger story.And also, with ""Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates,"" I'm going to be in Dayton for the first time on Friday. Going on WHIO. And I finish up in Jacksonville, Florida, at the Ritz Theater and Museum. Thanks to everyone that's supporting the book.GUILFOYLE: Congratulations.FRANCIS: Congrats.GUILFOYLE: Congratulations. I know it's been a work of passion for you. Very successful. God bless you.BOLLING: Geraldo.RIVERA: The funniest show on Broadway is called ""Oh, Hello"" with Nick Kroll and John Mulaney. You know, every day they have -- you know, they play two outrageously opinionated 70-something native New Yorkers. So I fit in perfectly. They are the funniest people around, Nick Kroll, John Mulaney. ""Oh, Hello"" is the show. Every -- they've had all kinds of special guests. They have an interview segment in the middle of it. They've had Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Stephen Colbert, Alan Alda, F. Murray Abraham, Jason Sudeikis, Seth Meyers, it goes on -- Whoopee Goldberg, John Alexander -- John Oliver. And they had me on. It was really funny. I was honored to be on.KILMEADE: On Broadway.GUILFOYLE: Very nice.FRANCIS: Very cool.RIVERA: And just ironically, they had a demonstration, an anti-Trump demonstration outside. So I had a lot to talk about.BOLLING: Very good. Melissa.FRANCIS: Excellent. All right. Do you recognize this Uber driver? We're going to put a picture up. This Uber driver. Wait. Is his picture there? It's hard to see. OK. It's Senator Ben Sasse from Nebraska. He was going around giving Uber rides over the weekend. Some college kids recognized him. It was for charity. But what a great way to get to know your community.He was giving out pro tips, as well. If you throw up in the Uber, the surcharge can be substantial. There you go. That's your takeaway for the night.GUILFOYLE: It's true. You can be charged a cleaning fee.FRANCIS: How do you know that?GUILFOYLE: Because I was reading all through it.BOLLING: See what happens when you become the premiere never Trumper and you lose? You drive for Uber.GUILFOYLE: You know how Bolling -- Bolling will take the shot.BOLLING: Makes sure you never miss an episode of ""The Five."" That's it for us.

This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" November 14, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, just 24 hours into President-elect Donald Trump's rollout of his White House staff, and he's already driving critics wild with a powerful new position for a close and controversial advisor.Good evening and welcome to ""The Kelly File"" everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. The fallout continues tonight after Mr. Trump announced that two of the men who helped guide his historic presidential campaign will be his closest confidant inside the walls of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Reince Priebus, the departing Republican National Committee chairman will become Mr. Trump's chief of staff.And Steve Bannon, the controversial former executive chairman of the conservative website Breitbart News will become Mr. Trump's chief strategist and senior counselor in the White House. It is Mr. Bannon's selection that's causing waves tonight. In moments, we'll be joined by Trump supporter and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich who may also be playing a big role in the new administration.And we'll also talk to Kurt Bardella, who worked with Steve Bannon at Breitbart for years. But first, we begin with Chief Washington Correspondent James Rosen with the new reaction to the latest move from the President-elect. James?JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, good evening.  Top Republicans tonight are urging the left and even some on the right who are dismayed by President-elect Trump's appointment of Stephen Bannon as a top White House adviser, to give the man a chance. Bannon is the rough- edge Trump campaign CEO named now as chief strategist and senior counselor at the White House. While former naval office Bannon brought a measure of managerial confidence to the Trump campaign, but it was under his leadership that Breitbart, the conservative website began to appeal to the so-called alt-right.With headlines excoriating Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol as a, quote, ""Renegade Jew and asserting notions like birth control makes women unattractive and crazy."" The spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said, quote, ""It is easy to see why the KKK views Trump as their champion when Trump appoints one of the four most peddlers of White Supremacist themes and rhetoric as his top aide.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Breitbart does give me a real pause about sometimes they're going well beyond accepted norms and frankly expressing view point are just not consistent with my values and I think many Americans as well.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: It was also unusual that Bannon's rank will be co-equal to that of Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman tacked now to serve as chief-of-staff. Traditionally the chief of staff has enjoyed privacy in running the White House. Today Priebus defended the appointment of his co-equal.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REINCE PRIEBUS, CHAIRMAN, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE: The Steve Bannon I know is that guy that is really on the same page with a lot of things -- almost everything that I agree with as far as advising President-elect Trump. So, I haven't seen any of these things that people are crying out about. But look, it's a good team. I think if people saw the last few months in the campaign, it worked very well.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told reporters at Trump Tower today that Priebus and Bannon complement each other adding, they both have the most important thing, the ear of the boss -- Megyn.  KELLY: James, great to see you.Joining us on this and the rest of the White House transition, Newt Gingrich, former Republican speaker of the House and co-author of the new book, ""Rediscovering God in America."" He's got another one, I just saw ""Treason"" in an airport today.(LAUGHTER)I can't keep up with them, Mr. Speaker.NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Thank you.  KELLY: Also with us is Kurt Bardella. He is the president and CEO of Endeavor Strategist and he worked for Bannon as a media consultant at Breitbart News.Let's start with you Kurt on Mr. Bannon. I mean, I've read a lot of things about him. His detractors say he pushes a racist, misogynist agenda, but what is the actual evidence of that?KURT BARDELLA, ENDEAVOR STRATEGIST, PRESIDENT AND CEO: Well, I think if you look at the litany of headlines that have run across Breitbart News for the last two years, headlines about women shouldn't be reporting in tech.  Women in the birth control issue with Planned Parenthood. You see an agenda form.KELLY: But you know his defenders would say, that he's not responsible for every headline that goes on Breitbart and he didn't write those pieces.BARDELLA: When you're at the top of the organization chart and an organization, what happens below you and what happens frequently, you have two choices, you can address it and say, this isn't who we are, this isn't who we believe and we shouldn't be doing these things or you don't do anything and you're willfully saying that that's okay.KELLY: Well, you worked with him. For how many years?BARDELLA: For almost two years.KELLY: Okay. And so, what was your experience?BARDELLA: My experience there was there were no issues at all when headlines like that were run, when media inquiries came in and asking, what do you think of these things? You guys stand by that. There was never any type of retraction, walking back, concession that maybe they went a little too far with some of the stuff. They were very happy when they got that kind of attention actually.  KELLY: Do you believe he believes in those principles if you will or do you believe he is just a provocateur looking to generate clicks and detention?BARDELLA: I think it's probably a little bit of both. I mean, when you look out his plan put into action during the Trump campaign, it's not like they ran away from those themes, they embraced them. They played off of them. And it's been a recipe for success for them so far, as evidence for the fact that Trump's in the White House right now and Steve is now in this very high profile co-chief of staff role.KELLY: Uh-hm.BARDELLA: But at the end of the day, actions speak louder than anything.  And their actions kind of speak for themselves.  KELLY: But, you know, Steve Bannon -- obviously Trump control himself. I mean, I think we've seen that Trump really answers to no man or woman. He controls his own approach. But Steve Bannon did sort of call the possibility of a Donald Trump as early as 2010. Listen to this, in 2010, I mean, he was talking about what the future holds. He says, it's going to be an insurgent, center right populist movement that is -- that is a tough word, very fluently anti-establishment, and it's going to continue to hammer this city, Washington, both the progressive left and the institutional Republican Party. I mean, that was 2010.BARDELLA: Yes, right after the Tea Party.KELLY: So, we can see why Trump was attracted to him.BARDELLA: Oh, they're made for each other here. Because you have two people who are provocateurs. Who do like being contrarians who enjoy pressing buttons and who have an issue with the status quo in Washington.  And Trump, Steve found the first political figure to really symbolize that that he can martial his platform around. And in Steve, Trump found an audience that existed for that message. They're a perfect match.  KELLY: Do you think that Steve Bannon that those kinds of comments and so on, the headlines of Breitbart, would be pushed as an agenda? You know, an anti-woman, anti-minority, anti-gay agenda. Trump certainly, I mean -- well, you tell me.BARDELLA: Yes, I think it's an agenda. I mean, I think any time that you're doing something as frequently as they have been with the audience and the size that they have, and the profile that they've built off of that, I don't know how you can say anything else other than that's clearly an agenda, that they're being pushed.KELLY: How does that make you feel if you feel that way and you work with the man closely for a couple of years?  BARDELLA: Well, that's part of the reason why I left. And I said this publicly back in March that I personally could not be a part of something like this anymore. And I believe that when you can't do your job honestly and to the best of your ability, that's when it's time to walk away. And that's why I did.KELLY: Are you all worried now being on the opposite side of Bannon given his ascension?BARDELLA: No. No. I mean first of all, if Steve Bannon is a co-White House chief of staff has nothing better to do than try to go after my life and livelihood. That's concerning all to itself, but at the end of the day, I think that he has bigger fish to fry.KELLY: Uh-hm. Kurt, great to see you.BARDELLA: Thanks for having me on, Megyn.KELLY: Thanks for coming on. And now we turn to Newt Gingrich, former Republican speaker of the House. Mr. Speaker, good to have you back.GINGRICH: Good to be with you.  KELLY: So, you've heard these reports about Steve Bannon and really, I'll show the viewers some of the headlines. And you know, he didn't write these, but he was the executive chairman of Breitbart when some of this went up and here is a couple. He called, not he, Breitbart referred to Bill Kristol as a renegade Jew. It was written by a Jewish author by still the solution online harassment is simple. Women should log off with another one. Here's a couple more for you. Stand by. They'll put them out there.Birth control makes women unattractive and crazy. Would you rather your child had feminism or cancer? And then there was these chestnuts, gay rights have made us dumber. Fat shaming works. So, those are the kinds of headlines that had people saying, hmmm, was this the big choice? Your thoughts.GINGRICH: Well, first of all, there's a big difference between the kind of stuff they did at Breitbart which was designed to attract audiences and was actually very successful and lots of people tuned in partly out of amusement. It's like we and the Daily Mail every day from London. I mean, there are all sorts of stuffs there and you keep finding yourself doing it.  (CROSSTALK)GINGRICH: Bannon is a very serious guy. Callista and I have worked with him on several movies. We know him pretty well. He is very deeply concerned that Washington has grown corrupt. Way to large as the government. A threat to our liberties. And he feels those things very deeply. He's also a former naval officer who has served this country very patriotically. Played a big role in the election of Donald Trump.I thought what Trump did was frankly very smart. He took Reince Priebus who had done probably the best job as RNC chairman in modern history. Put him in as the daily coordinator as chief of staff, but then he said look, I want a guy who's going to think about the fights we're going to be in and he's going to be enthusiastic about those fights. And he gave -- in some ways, yes, I think I ended up giving Bannon the equivalent of the Karl Rove job or the Axelrod job in previous administrations.KELLY: And that's what Bannon has said, that he's a fighter. And he liked to buff up, you know, Washington, he doesn't like the establishment. And that's what Trump is. That is what a lot of Trump's voters and supporters wanted.Now, let me ask you about the news and a potential cabinet appointments.  Tonight, the AP is reporting that Rudy Giuliani is the favorite, they're saying the favorite for secretary of state. Do you have any information on that?GINGRICH: I have no information, but if Rudy wants it, he'll get it. Rudy has probably been the closest surrogate, he and Senator Sessions have been the two closest surrogates to President-elect Trump. He has done a great job. He has worked his heart out. I thought he might prefer Attorney General where he would be brilliant or Homeland Security where his experience at 9/11 will be great. I think he'll be fabulous to have him as Secretary of State. He's already known worldwide. He is a great manager.  And he would do a lot both to represent America, which is what we need, and to reform the State Department. Which we need. So, I'd be very enthusiastic if he picks Rudy to be secretary of state.KELLY: Some are saying, Jeff Sessions will probably go Secretary of Defense and that Laura Ingraham may be under consideration for press secretary and another position in the administration which she did not shoot down when she was on Tucker Carlson's new show today at 7 by the way.Possibly, General Michael Flynn for NSA and what about you, Mr. Speaker?  Are you being considered for a position and is there one you have your eye on?GINGRICH: Well, I want to be the general planner looking out over the next eight years and trying to design how we fundamentally reshape the federal government. And that's a very broad job. The closest analogy probably is Harry Hopkins and the work he did for Franklin Delano Roosevelt. But let me just say it for a second about Sessions, Senator Sessions was the most loyal, the earliest supporter of Trump in Washington. He would be a great as Attorney General because he spent 13 years in the Justice Department, and was Attorney General of Alabama. He would also be tremendous at the Department of Defense. I would be very enthusiastic whatever he and the President-elect decide.KELLY: Now, Trump is getting hit tonight in some corners because he is asking for top secret clearance for his children in the Trump administration. And the conflict his detractors say is that he has said his adult children are going to be running the Trump organization and that it would be inappropriate or wrong to have them maintain this active business interest with international ties, and both have access to top secret information. Is that -- do they have a point?GINGRICH: Look, I think when you look at how Hillary Clinton totally views the system, I would sure trust Ivanka or Donald or Don, Jr. or Eric, heck a lot more than Hillary Clinton. And I think that they would keep the secrets. The objective fact is, this is a president-elect who's going to rely very closely on his family, including Jared Kushner, Ivanka's husband.  The four of them really form his brain system. These are people he trusts, he loves, he feels comfortable with. I think the President of the United States ought to be able to designate the people he wants advice from. And I think that these four are going to be tremendous assets to the United States of America.KELLY: Uh-huh. But just to press you once more on that, the critics are suggesting that not necessarily that they couldn't be trusted to not reveal the top secret information, but that it poses an interesting dilemma, conflict for them in making business decisions --GINGRICH: Yes, I'll tell you what.KELLY: -- about foreign countries that they actually have some top secret knowledge about.GINGRICH: I'll tell you what, the first time they come in with a $25 million check from the Saudis, they come in with a million dollar birthday check from Gutter or they come in with special deals from a variety of international people. Precisely like Bill Clinton for a long time --KELLY: We didn't know about that.GINGRICH: Well, of course you could. I'll start to worry about it.KELLY: But we wouldn't. We wouldn't know about that.GINGRICH: Yes. Historically, we were a country where people like John Foster Dallas could be a great international lawyer and a very powerful secretary of state. Historically, we thought you had to have people who were competent and knew things and they actually could work together. It's only in the last 30 or 40 years we got this whacky idea that if you actually know something and succeed in something, you're probably not appropriately involved in government. So you end up with people in government who don't know anything and can't do anything.KELLY: Uh-hm.GINGRICH: I think this is something we ought to explore carefully. There should clearly be rules, there might well have to be certain amount of transparency. And then frankly, the Trump family has to decide. Are they going to live with that transparency? There's no question you're asking an important question about this. And I think that we have to explore it, but in principle, having the President have an ability to talk candidly with people who are very, very close to him, I think is a good thing, not a bad thing.KELLY: Mr. Speaker, thank you for being here and congratulations.GINGRICH: Thank you. Thank you.KELLY: Congratulations on Donald Trump's win.Well even before the President-elect takes office, some Democratic mayors are already staging a result. Pledging to fight any new White House effort to endorse immigration laws. Have you heard about this? It's spreading now.Judge Andrew Napolitano is next on what is shaping up to be an explosive show down in more than one city.Plus, six days and some in the media are still having a meltdown over the results of the election. We'll speak with Howard Kirk and Mollie Hemmingway about where this is going, next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR WRITER, THE FEDERALIST: The media definitely -- they clearly and overtly and even told us that they wanted Hillary to win and they gambled everything, including their credibility on defeating Donald Trump and electing Hillary Clinton and they lost.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, six days since the election and some in the media are still publicly struggling with how to deal with the results of last Tuesday. Just in the last 24 hours, we saw New York Times columnist Charles Blow complaining that, quote, ""We are living in two diverging Americas at odds and at battle. Trump's America won this round."" E.J. Dionne, Jr. of the Washington Post writing quote, ""Let's be clear, the United States of America is not Donald Trump's country."" And in the same publication, Jonathan Capehart writes about, quote, ""Why millions fear the looming Trump presidency."" Adding, ""President-elect Trump has made promises that represent a real, that represent a threat to real lives and livelihoods. Some are unconstitutional. All are immoral.""Joining me now, Howard Kurtz, host of ""MediaBuzz"" and Mollie Hemmingway, senior editor at the Federalist. Great to see you both. So, Mollie, let me ask you, do you take issue with those headlines?HEMMINGWAY: Oh, I mean, it's just been kind of surprising to see how poorly many in our media have handled this election. Part of it is just that they are in liberal bubbles and that the people that they're surrounded by are also struggling, so they're kind of focused on that side of the story, but a big part of it is that they can't really come to terms with Donald Trump being president until they come to terms of just how profoundly they failed to cover this election well.And this is not just about the polls, this is not about trusting in them too much. It's about really misunderstanding the nature of the race, misunderstanding how Hillary Clinton was viewed by a lot of Americans as well as Donald Trump, and then most importantly I think profoundly misunderstanding who Donald Trump voters were. And you see that in these headlines you just pointed out, there is still a hostility and an inability to even try to understand what motivated his supporters.KELLY: Howie, do you agree with that?HOWARD KURTZ, HOST, ""MEDIABUZZ"": Liberal commentators have entitled to their opinions but some that have been really ugly and refusing to accept the outcome of this election, Megyn and they continue to attack Donald Trump. They continue to call the people who voted for Donald Trump racist and morons, we're talking here about 60 million American voters. And some of them are beating up on the press because it was our job, somehow, to stop Donald Trump. Which of course it was not our job. But I'm even more troubled by the elements of the mainstream media that are still hostile to varying degrees toward the guy who had won six days ago.  KELLY: Now, how do you square this with the genuine controversies that Trump himself created, right? Because the media had, he can't have the ""Access Hollywood"" buzz thing break and then have 12 women come forward and saying that he insulted them and ignore it. Right? And so, how do you scare Mollie things like all the controversy Trump himself created. You know, like, hey, there's my African-American and the Mexico is not sending its best people and all that stuff that he did generate controversy with, with media bias.HEMINGWAY: Well, all of those things are real and everybody is very familiar with all of Donald Trump's weaknesses. This is where I think it gets back to the fundamentals of the race and what actually motivated voters. I mean, one of the things that's interesting about the Hillary Clinton campaign, they wanted to focus on Donald Trump's personality. And that did make for very good copy and very good TV and there's a reason why we focus on it, because it's very dramatic. At the same time, there were serious policy issues in play, support for his plans on immigration, foreign policy, economic policy as well as something that I think even, you know, many people who did kind of pick-up on these things didn't realize which is a very big frustration with political correctness itself.KELLY: Uh-huh.HEMINGWAY: And people are just kind of sick of that kind of focus and they're punching back.KELLY: Uh-huh, that's true, the political correctness thing is real, Howie, and we've been covering it for years now. And I do think that there is a segment, you tell me, of media, that doesn't get that and just things that there's something wrong with you if you don't want to clean up our language, our politician's language and language as a society.KURTZ: I think it's worse than that. I think for some in the media, there's something wrong with you if you somehow supported Donald Trump.  And not seeing that the country has moved to a different place. Now it's fine for journalists to continue to report aggressively on President-elect Trump, but let me just read you one sentence from a New York Times new story. This is when President-elect Trump visited President Obama at the White House. Mr. Trump whose campaign drew support from White supremacist groups sat in front of a bus of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.It's that kind of thing that sends a signal that we're not over it, we're not going to get over it. Now the Time's editor and publisher did put out sort of a modified mea culpa, we underestimated Trump. But this kind of thing just signals that it's almost like announcing. We're going to be in the loyal opposition for the next four years instead of giving you guy a fair shot at showing he can't be president.KELLY: Yep. And I mean, to diminish it, you know, 60 million voters as summed up by the White supremacists who did support him doesn't quite get it.Mollie, let me ask you, because some in the media, like we saw in New York magazine with this cover, before the election, before the election, right?  So, you wonder why some in, you know, in the general population think that some in the media are not being fair. They have an agenda. They have their thumb on their scale when it comes to now President-elect Trump.HEMINGWAY: Well, and clearly they did. And people were very overt about that. There's actually a benefit to that. We had a lot of people come and just admit that they thought their job was to keep Donald Trump from becoming president and to help Hillary Clinton get into office. It's good to know where people stand. Unfortunately, there's been therefore a complete destruction of that trust relationship between viewers, readers, listeners, and the media. And so the media needed to a very good job of first of all, coming to terms with just how serious the failure was. And they really need to start doing that quickly because it hasn't happened yet. Then they also need to just start reporting the news and not telling people what to think about it. Their spin is not nearly as crafty as they think it is and people are seeing through it.KELLY: Uh-hm. And they are may be out of touch with, you know, flyover country, real Americans. Not that you're not a real American on the coast, but just Americans who live in the heartland, who just have different values and see the world differently than the people media surround themselves with.HEMINGWAY: All Americans are real Americans, but you're not seeing a lot of diversity in American newsrooms. And so, I think that people who run newspapers, magazines, and radio programs and television programs, they really need to make sure that they're getting an intellectual diversity in those newsrooms.KELLY: True. True. However, Howie, that is not -- I mean, let's be honest here, many of the Trump supporters were -- I mean, incendiary in their hate for certain reporting. And I'm not referring to anybody in particular, but certain reporting that was critical of Donald Trump or skeptical of Donald Trump that was right on the money. You know, controversies that he generated.KURTZ: There's no question that all of us in the news business when we did do a legitimate questioning of the incendiary statements Trump has made, or things about his record got a lot of ugliness and abuse online. And I'm not excusing that. But look at the coverage, a muted coverage of these protests. Imagine if Hillary Clinton had won and Trump supporters were out there demonstrating in city and saying, not my president and in some cases engaging in --KELLY: They're all sexist. They'd be saying they're all sexist --KURTZ: Exactly. Exactly.KELLY: If it had been President Obama, they're racist, I know, and we've seen the double standard. Great to see you both.KURTZ: Same here, Megyn.KELLY: So, two weeks ago, President Obama was telling the world that Donald Trump was unfit for office.Just ahead, we'll show you what happened when reporters today asked if Mr. Trump if he stands by that statement.Plus, some Democratic mayors are now threatening to go to war with the Trump White House over any new federal efforts to crack down on sanctuary cities.Judge Andrew Napolitano is here on the legal fight and then David Wohl and Julie Roginsky join us on the political fallout, next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RAHM EMANUEL, CHICAGO MAYOR: To be clear about what Chicago is, it always will be a sanctuary city.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)ANNOUNCER: From the World Headquarters of FOX News, it's THE KELLY FILE, with Megyn Kelly.KELLY: A defiant message to President-elect Donald Trump from a former White House Chief of Staff. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel suggesting in a news conference today that Chicago will remain a so-called sanctuary city, where police are not obligated to cooperate with immigration officials or so say their local leaders. Trace Gallagher is live in our west coast newsroom with the report, Trace.TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn today marks the third time since Donald Trump was elected president that Mayor Rahm Emanuel has publicly pushed back against Trump's immigration policies, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL: To all those who are after Tuesday's election very nervous, is filled with anxiety has been spoken to, you are safe in Chicago. You are secure in Chicago. And you are supported in Chicago.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: The mayor did not promise to protect illegal immigrants with criminal records, which for now is exactly who Donald Trump is targeting, so he said last night on ""60 minutes."" But the very definition of a sanctuary city means that local law enforcement don't cooperate with federal immigration authorities. And thousands of criminal illegal immigrants are released on U.S. streets every year.Like the 2015 case of Francisco Lopez Sanchez who was convicted of seven times, deported five times, and despite federal agents asking San Francisco authorities to hold him, Lopez Sanchez was released got hold of a gun and killed Kate Steinly. President-elect Trump has promised to battle sanctuary cities by cutting off federal funds, costing places like Chicago billions of dollars. It remains unclear if blocking funds would need congressional approval or could be done with executive order.What is clear is that a Trump administration with new Chief Strategist Steve Bannon and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus appear likely to favor a very tough anti-immigration stance. Along with Chicago Mayor Emanuel, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti are vowing to maintain their sanctuary status, Megyn.KELLY: Trace thanks, joining me now, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. Good to see you, Judge.ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Good to see you.KELLY: Can they do this? Legally can the mayor say no to president Trump, once he takes office?NAPOLITANO: Ok. Here's what the mayors are not doing. They are not hiding people from the feds. They are just refusing to provide data and information to the feds. And the Supreme Court has ruled the federal government cannot commandeer local police and make them work for them. So even though this will be frustrating to a President Trump and he probably will have to find some way to sanction them financially.KELLY: That is what he is saying. He is promising to cancel all federal funding to them.NAPOLITANO: He can't do that unilaterally, but I'm sure, once Republicans controlling both houses of the congress, he could put into expenditure and block grants to cities. You must do the following things in order to qualify for the block grants. But it's a basic principle of constitutional law that the federal government cannot force the states or the towns and cities to work for it. So Mayor Emanuel, Mayor de Blasio, Mayor Garcetti are within their legal rights to do what they're doing.KELLY: But what's happens is sanctuary cities get carried out a number of different ways, like for example like in Chicago, they originally just stopped all city agencies from inquiring about immigration status when they provide services. It's like don't ask don't tell, we don't to want know.  And in other cities, they just refuse to cooperate with ICE, issues of detainer on an individual. Its like, didn't happen, and didn't see it.NAPOLITANO: That stuff can have unattended consequences that the locals are not going to want. The type of people that Donald Trump is talking about is not your average ma and pa. He is talking about someone who has been convicted.KELLY: Like Francisco Hernandez.NAPOLITANO: Convicted of a crime, gets out of jail and is now free, but illegally present.KELLY: Uh-huh.NAPOLITANO: Allowing that person to stay in Chicago is going to harm the citizens of Chicago.KELLY: So what are the federal government rights? I mean if Donald Trump tries to take away funding and he gets something passed that says you're federal funding is done, until you comply with the law and until you actually do inquire about immigration status or enforce the ICE detainers, I mean it's a real show of will against between the federal government and the state.NAPOLITANO: Look at how hard up the cities is for cash. The federal government's going to be dangling billions in front of them, they're probably going to cave on this, because they'll want the cash. And if they don't cave and don't get the cash, there'll be tremendous local political pressure on them to do so, but they are legally and constitutionally within their right to say to the federal government, we're not going to work for you.KELLY: Great to see you, judge.NAPOLITANO: Thank you.KELLY: Joining me more on the politics, David Wohl, Trump supporter and attorney and Julie Roginsky, Democratic Analyst and Fox News Contributor, great to see you both.JULIE ROGINSKY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you.DAVID WOHL, TRUMP SUPPORTER: Hi there.KELLY: So politically, you tell me whether this is a test. This could be one of the first big tests for President Trump if these mayors and these various cities, New York, L.A., Seattle, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Chicago just defy him, David.WOHL: Yeah, I have no doubt about it, Megyn. I mean this is more than just the mayor and the police chief in Los Angeles for example, choosing federal law or state law or vice versa. They're creating policies that are in complete prevention of any law. And what they're doing, they're doing it for political purposes. Obviously they want votes from the people they feel that they're protecting and I got to say, you know, it's not going to work, because Trump's going to come after him. He wants these people out of the country, two to three million violent criminals, he wants them gone.  He cut off funding. He can also prosecute for obstruction of justice for aiding and abetting a felon, for -- with accessory to after the fact, so many felony charges that could be brought by the new attorney general if he decides to do that.KELLY: Not for just not inquiring about immigration status. You can't prosecute them for that.WOHL: For example, when they're released for jail, they have an immigration hold, but that they ignore. Like you said, it's actively obstructing the feds from carrying out the responsibilities that leads to much more to what you have just said.KELLY: Not carrying out the ICE container.WOHL: Just negligence.KELLY: Yeah because the ICE, Immigration enforcement can't run in there and detain everybody. They issue the detainer and relying on the local authorities if a guy gets arrested, detain him, who is in some of these sanctuary cities, Julie they don't. So you tell me how you see it.ROGINSKY: Well, let's talk about the fact that sanctuary cities don't just include violent criminals which we all agree should be locked up and I have no problem with supporting those that are truly violent. Not people who could have tickets, because they are pulled over, but people who commit violent crimes. But you know there are unattended consequences, let's say you're a 15-year-old girl whose parents are here illegally, you are a girl who get assaulted, you're afraid to call the police and report it because if the police comes in to your house, you are afraid for your parents are going to be potentially be arrested, detained, and deported. Do when you're talking about sanctuary cities, let's not just talk about the violent criminals which we all agree should be prosecuted and should be detained and deported, but you're talking about people who are here who are not committing any crime.KELLY: But the flip side of that Julie, the flipside of that is the tolerance for people, this is the other side. Who are in the country illegally, we see situations like Francisco Hernandez who murdered Kate Steinly and so, the people who want this policy say it's not worth it.  They have empathy for the 15-year-old girl, but they have empathy for Kate Steinly and her family too.ROGINSKY: Well I have too much sympathy for Kate Steinly. The killer should never have been released from (inaudible).(CROSSTALK)KELLY: But he was, in a sanctuary city.ROGINSKY: No question --WOHL: Yeah.ROGINSKY: He was, let me just finish this, he was and should not have been. He was obviously a criminal, but I'm talking about that 15-year-old girl and there are many more of those people than violent criminals who will be scared to cooperate with local law enforcement which will lead to crimes, because community.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Other crimes would go up.WOHL: Precisely for sanctuary cities, precisely allow people like the man who murdered Kate Steinly to stay there without fear of being deported and that is the problem. Mr. Trump is going on a case by case basis will not involve deporting the young girl, you are describing, it will involve deporting the 15 rather the two to three million violent criminals that needed to be deported. And Barack Obama by the way had ignored completely.ROGINSKY: No, excuse me. Barack Obama deported more people than those under him.WOHL: Why are they in the country then?KELLY: Barack Obama deportations are largely catch and release at the border. We have to leave it at that, great to see you both.ROGINSKY: All right. Thank you.WOHL: Thank you.KELLY: Anti-Trump protesters that want college campus claim their first scalp after one professor shares the dissenting view.  Take a picture.  Take a guess what that professor's view was. We'll show you what happened.And up next, see what happens when reporters asked Mr. Obama if he still thinks President-elect Trump is unfit for office.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Now that you've spent time with him for an hour and a half in the oval office, do you now think that President-elect Trump is qualified to be president?  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: On the economy, Donald Trump is uniquely unqualified to be our Chief executive. That is why most CEO's don't support him. On foreign policy, Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be Commander in Chief. Don't take my word for it.  Listen to the Republicans who've refused to support him. Over the weekend, his campaign took away his twitter account, because he is erratic. If his closest advisors don't trust him to tweet, why would any of us trust him with the nuclear codes?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That was President Obama one week ago, the night before the election. Here's what happened when reporters asked about those remarks at a press conference this afternoon.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You said more than once that you would not believe that Donald Trump would ever be elected president and you thought he was unfit for the office. Now that you've spent time with him for an hour and a half in the oval office, do you now think that President-elect Trump is qualified to be president?OBAMA: You know, I think that he successfully mobilized a big chunk of the country to vote for him, and he is going to win. He has won. He is going to be the next president. And regardless of what experience or assumptions he brought to the office, this office has a way of waking you up. Some of his gifts that obviously allowed him to execute one of the biggest political upsets in history, those are ones that hopefully he will put to good use on behalf of all the American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Politics is weird. Mo Elleithee is the founding executive director of the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service and Carl Higbie is the spokesperson for the Great America PAC, great to see you both.CARL HIGBIE, THE GREAT AMERICA PAC: Not anymore, Megyn.KELLY: Oh not anymore?HIGBIE: No.KELLY: Are you moving into the administration?HIGBIE: No, not yet, but the PAC is dissolved that day after. I can say whatever I want.KELLY: Yeah. I predicted the future in the administration for Carl Higbie, you heard it here first.HIGBIE: We'll see.KELLY: I know now nothing, I am just predicting.Ok, let me ask you, Mo, I actually thought President Obama's willingness to sound a more conciliatory, hopeful tone about Donald Trump who he clearly does not like, spoke well of him. What'd you think?MO ELLEITHEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE OF POLITICS: Yeah, I agree. Look, I don't think there's any question that President Obama was not a fan of Donald Trump heading into the election.KELLY: Vice versa.ELLEITHEE: Or vice-versa, I think I'm putting it mildly to say that, but I think everything he has said since then has been exactly what he should say.KELLY: Uh-huh.ELLEITHEE: It is his job. It is his responsibility to oversee a strong transition to the new President-elect. And he and his staff have been doing everything they can to make sure that transition goes well. You know, he can be asked as many times as people are going to ask him if -- what he thinks of the President-elect, that is irrelevant at this point.  It's his responsibility to make sure the transition goes well. I think that is what he is doing, and I think he did a good job of pointing to try to ease some of Americans -- some of the concerns that Americans have by pointing out some of the strengths that Donald Trump may bring to the office.KELLY: And also suggesting that the office can lift you up and can change you in a way that is beneficial for the country. But Carl, there were other comments too where it was leaked today that when Donald Trump walked through the White House and with his staff, that the staff was clueless about the fact that the existing west wing staff all have to leave there won't be any holdovers, they are going to have to fill all those post and it was sort of don't worry, Barack Obama's going helm him out. He is going to help. And political watchers said that is clearly a shot by the existing White House team.HIGBIE: Yeah. Well, I think Barack Obama said it for two reasons, one he didn't think Donald Trump was going to win. Back then he was very confident that Hillary was going to be his successor, but two, also I think Barack Obama, like you said, is trying to help him out and he is effectively trying to keep Donald Trump from overturning most of his legislation, which, you know, quite frankly, you know, has been a disaster.  So Obama's going to try to do anything he can to salvage his legacy.KELLY: What do you think, Mo? President Obama said look, Donald Trump is not ideological. He is pragmatic. Which is probably true, right? Doesn't seem ideological (inaudible).ELLEITHEE: Yeah. That is right, yes.KELLY: Then he went on to say, but he has to watch his temperament and be careful about messaging and pointed out how it's one thing to say something as a candidate, but when you are the president of the United States, you can change markets. You can change safety and world security.HIGBIE: Gitmo -- oh wait, no.KELLY: Do you think Donald Trump's going get that, Mo?ELLEITHEE: I think every single person who has ever stepped into the oval office has found that that office has changed them. I think anyone who has walked into that office has realized that the office not only changes them, but changes some of the things they hope to accomplish. President Obama said very famously that when he was running for president he wanted to change the political culture of Washington. And he tells you now that that he wasn't able to do that, that there were too many realities here that stopped that from happening.So, I think what he is saying is true. That President-elect Trump is not an ideologue. I think he scrambled a lot of the typical ideological divide in this country. And that he is pragmatic and I think the president is both predicting and maybe hoping a bit that wants he gets into office he'll realize that some of the things he talked about just can't happen.KELLY: Carl, I'll give you the last word.HIGBIE: Well, a lot of the things he talk about can happen. I think it takes somebody who's, you know annoyed at the system enough. I mean look at the fact of the matter is, Donald Trump has been so, you know, anxious and so happy to get in this office and try to crush the system that is been breaking America's back. I think he can do it and I think he is the right man for the job.KELLY: All right guys, great to see you. And you are not alone in that belief. Well, we've seen anti-Trump protests breaking out in many cities and many American campuses. But wait until you hear what happened to this professor when he dared to share a dissenting view. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Developing tonight, a program director at the University of Rochester forced to step down after he dares to take on some anti-Trump protesters on his campus. Trace Gallagher has the story, Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, after the election University of Rochester President Joe Seligman sent an email ensuring students that, ""We are a safe place."" He also offered free counseling for anyone struggling with last night's election. Of course any student that was not emotionally broken was more than welcome to trash Trump during a campus protest on or the school's anti-America Facebook page. Ted Fauliki, who is the undergraduate program director of computer science decided to post a pro-Trump message on the school's not my America Facebook page writing quoting here, a bus ticket from Rochester to Canada is $16, if this is not your America, then I will pay for your ticket if you promise never to come back. Well it turns out some of the students were offended, so the Dean asked him to step down. He did. He remains a senior lecturer, but he says, he was just trying to be funny, listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The move to Canada when your candidate loses joke has been around as long as I can remember in politics. Many celebrities threaten to move to Canada if their candidate doesn't get elected. So it was in that sense that I posted it. I was trying to be funny.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Bottom line, supporting Trump ok, bashing Trump, fine, other the other way around.KELLY: Thanks trace. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: It's here! Tomorrow my book comes out. ""Settle for More"" finally hits stores. And it's already making big headlines. It's about my life, my values, really the values of middle class America. And how I went from a small town girl to a big city lawyer only to realize, man, was I unhappy.  One night watching Dr. Phil, it dawned on me that I did not have to settle.  For what had become a mediocre unhappy life. That I could settle for more.  And so can you. It's got stuff in there about the weirdest I had with Mr. Trump as well which I have to leave now over as I discussed on Dr. Phil's program tomorrow.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, ""DR. PHIL"")DR. PHIL MCGRAW, HOST: You now have a contentious relationship with a man that is now, arguably, the most powerful man on the planet, as the president of the United States.KELLY: Well, I don't think I did have a contentious relationship with him.  I feel that Trump and I had moved past that after I met him at Trump Tower and did the long sit down with him. And I have a good relationship with his children, with his wife. And so, he and I think, you know, we're not tight, but I don't think we do have a problem with one another.(END VIDEO CLIP)I'm also going on tour with ""The Kelly File,"" coming possibly to a city --  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.
