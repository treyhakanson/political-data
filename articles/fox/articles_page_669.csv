1	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/08/30/katrina-pierson-on-trump-immigration-stance/	Katrina Pierson on Trump's immigration stance	"This is a RUSH transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" August 29, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!ERIC BOLLING, FOX NEWS HOST: Hi, I'm Eric Bolling in for Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching us tonight. Let's get straight to our top story. Donald Trump's immigration plan. The Republican nominee announcing he will deliver a major speech on illegal immigration set for Wednesday in Arizona with an increasing number of questions about his stance on deportation, his campaign is delivering an outline for what may be ahead.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: First, there is still no amnesty. Secondly, he is building that wall. That has been the centerpiece of his candidacy and his immigration vision from the beginning and it has not changed one inch. Third, we have to end sanctuary cities. He has said that if you want to be here legally, you have to apply to be here legally. We all learned in kindergarten to stand in line and wait our turn, and he is not talking about deportation force, but he is talking about being fair and humane but also being fair to the American workers who are competing for jobs, being fair to all of us who want secure borders and want the law enforced.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Joining us from Dallas with reaction, Katrina Pierson, national spokesperson for the Trump campaign.Katrina, let's start with that immigration plan. I hear that. I hear no amnesty. I heard build the wall. Let's zone in on the deportation. No deportation force but will he suggest the 11 or 12 million leave and come back?KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP CAMPAIGN NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: Absolutely. That part of the policy has not changed. Just not using those same words. Those words actually came from a journalist that sort of carried in to Mr. Trump's policies. He absolutely wants illegal aliens to leave the country and get in line as you heard Kellyanne Conway just state. We have to secure the border. This is not just about immigration. This is about human trafficking. This is about drug trafficking. These are things that affect American citizens on a daily basis.And we have to enforce current laws on the books. And we have ICE, Eric, that is the current deportation force that we have in the United States. And we have to give them the ability to do their job efficiently and effectively. Ending sanctuary cities is going to be key. And having a functional e-verify system to make sure that Americans are getting the jobs in this country, by the time we complete those four stages of Mr. Trump's plan, there is not going to be 11 million people in this country illegally. And once we get to that point, Mr. Trump is going to lay out on Wednesday what he wants to do with those 11 million or less who are going to be here by that point.BOLLING: Yes. Katrina, you know, what's interesting to me is President Obama has prided himself on deportations for the last eight years. In fact, he calls himself the president who has deported more illegals than any other president. I think the number is almost three million deportations under President Obama. Yet, the left will point the finger at Donald Trump saying that that's cruel.PIERSON: Well, and that's because it's a Republican saying those things and the one thing that you won't see under a President Trump that we currently see under President Obama, the Obama/Clinton administration is that he will not be releasing criminal aliens back into the population. That would be an automatic deportation. Mr. Trump wants to prioritize this process. And of course, we can't get all of this done in the first day of office. This is going to be a process.And Mr. Trump wants to outline his priorities because at the end of the day in November, you have two choices. You have a candidate that wants to crack down on border security, get criminal illegal aliens out of the country and focus on putting American families first or you can have Hillary Clinton, someone that in the first 100 days of her office wants to give amnesty, someone that's not even concerned with the borders in this country.BOLLING: Katrina, last question on the immigration topic, something an issue that's near and dear to this show right here sanctuary cities. Now, will Mr. Trump recommend no sanctuary cities in the United States?PIERSON: Oh, absolutely. We absolutely have to get rid of sanctuary cities. You know, I'm here in Texas, Eric. And this is something that we have been talking about for a very long time. It hurts American families. And Mr. Trump wants to make America safe again as well as great again and that is going to be one of the most critical steps is to end those sanctuary cities.BOLLING: Okay. Let's turn the topic to the Chicago tweets. Over the weekend, Dwayne Wade's cousin Nykea Aldridge was murdered. She was shot. Bringing her child after signing up for school. Mr. Trump tweet and he is getting a little bit of heat for the tweet that -- here is the tweet right here. ""Dwayne wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. But what I have been saying all along, African-Americans will vote Trump.""Now, the issue being that he tweeted that first and then tweeted condolences afterwards. So this -- what is this all about? Is this a timing issue or is this politics?PIERSON: Well, it's a timing issue. And, look, this is not the first time Mr. Trump has pointed out senseless violence in a community like Chicago. This has been ongoing discussion that he has had for a very long time. And even though we have a lot of people in the media and the talking heads out there saying that Mr. Trump hasn't made an attempt to go into these communities. He went to that community in March, during the primary. Mr. Trump is very concerned with communities like Chicago and Baltimore and Maryland simply because they have no voice. And Mr. Trump is the first Republican candidate in a very long time to ask for a chance to be that voice for them. And that's what this was about.BOLLING: Okay. So, some of the push back has been that Mr. Trump will make this outreach to the African-American community, the minority communities, Hispanic communities but he will do that in front of a white audience. Will that change going forward?PIERSON: Well, that will absolutely change. And, you know, again, I will push back on that because Mr. Trump made an attempt to go to Chicago. He spoke at the Black Chamber of Commerce in South Carolina. He has met with black pastors organizations. A black church just endorsed him last month. So, this is not brand new to Mr. Trump. It's just brand new to the media.BOLLING: Okay. And the last topic I want to get to is Huma Abedin announced today that she was leaving her husband Anthony Weiner. Now, we know the history of Anthony Weiner. He has had trouble. He's been sexting. He's been caught sexting and whatnot. Now Huma says they are breaking up. But Mr. Trump issued a statement on this. What is he saying his stance on Huma Abedin?PIERSON: Well, he just wished her well mainly but he has concerned with asking the question. You know? Is this the type of judgment Hillary Clinton would have to allow someone with this type of access? Someone like Anthony Weiner in his statement. He was simply just asking the asking. Simply because we do know that Huma Abedin was one of the individuals that had a duel rule at the State Department as well as the Clinton Foundation that was handling some of these sensitive information. And he was very concerned about who else's hands that might have ended up in.BOLLING: So, is he concerned -- was he concerned and was he still concerned that going forward Huma Abedin having access to the security briefings that he as well is saying I guess starting now?PIERSON: Well, that's why he included the question mark. These are things that we don't know. We also know that thousands more emails have surfaced and we are going to find out a little bit more. That Hillary Clinton has been in hiding, 266 days without a press conference. And she won't answer any of these questions. So, these are the things we don't know which is exactly why Mr. Trump included that question mark.BOLLING: All right. Katrina, thank you very much. We'll leave it right there. Thank you.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

5	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/06/10/will-trump-be-able-to-shake-off-judge-remarks/	Will Trump be able to shake off the judge remarks?	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" June 10, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DONALD TRUMP, PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Here is what Hillary Clinton would do to our country. She'll appoint radical judges who will legislate from the bench, overriding Congress.Hillary Clinton's Wall Street agenda will crush working families.She wants to raise your taxes big-league folks, big-league.She wants to abolish the Second Amendment.HILLARY CLINTON, PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Donald Trump would take us in the wrong direction on so many issues we care about -- economic justice, workers' rights, civil rights, human rights, the environment. All of that is on the line in this election.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Well, get ready. We're going to hear more of that. The general election in full bloom, if you will. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton today.Meantime, Donald Trump dealing with some, some people in his own party, including the Senate majority leader, who said this in an interview.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY: It's pretty obvious he doesn't know a lot about the issues. I think he'd have a much better chance of winning if he would quit making so many unfortunate public utterances and stick to the script.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: He also said to pick a lawmaker who knows stuff. This was Trump's response in a quote to TIME magazine, ""My voters don't care and the public doesn't care. They know you're going to do a good job once you are there.""With that, let's bring in our panel, expanded panel today: Steve Hayes, senior writer for The Weekly Standard; Amy Walter, national editor for The Cook Political Report; Tucker Carlson, host of ""Fox & Friends Weekend,"" and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer.OK, how is this shaping up, Amy? Has Trump gone over the tough week, or is he back to getting his stride? Or do you think he's kind of wobbly still?AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, ""COOK POLITICAL REPORT"": The best quote I saw about this was, it's in a construction site when it says x number of days since we've had an accident. I think we went four days now with sticking to script. I don't know that it's going to be maybe a whole week. But I think we're going to see this pattern continue where he is not a scripted candidate. That is the appeal of Donald Trump. That is his brand is to be somebody who is not going to be a typical politician. So I think he will for the short-term stay on script. But I think what you're going to see once the barrage of attacks come from Democrats, the super PACs, et cetera, seeing him stick to script then is going to be very interesting.BAIER: He was on script today here about Hillary Clinton's emails.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Hillary Clinton has jeopardized, totally jeopardized national security by putting her emails on a private server, all to hide her corrupt dealings.  Bill and Hillary made $153 million giving speeches to special interest groups since 2001. These donors own Hillary Clinton. They own her.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Tucker, he's getting ready we're told to give a big speech with this focus specifically on Monday.TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Any time he's not talking about himself, it's a good day. The question is, does the campaign see his attacks on the judge as an existential threat to the presidential campaign? Those words hang in the air, they can't be taken back. But they can be learned from. And do they see this as the moment where he might have blown it? And are they going to make the necessary changes?It's possible that they do. Look, the more he talks about Hillary, the better. At the very moment he was speaking, she was speaking to Planned Parenthood. It's kind of hard to believe in the wake of those videos anybody would get in front of a Planned Parenthood sign and give a speech in public, and yet she did. So the more attention on that the better change he has. I think discipline befits his campaign.BAIER: Charles, you know we saw the FOX News poll where he trails three but within the margin of error on registered voters. But you ask likely, are you interested in this election, likely to vote. And he's up four over Hillary Clinton. This is after the judge's comments. So is it sticking? It's only one poll, but you wonder what the impact is.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: The real third rail of American politics is race and racism. And if you're accused of it by people in your own party, then it becomes something that you can't really shake off. Whether -- I don't think it's going to have any effect on people who supported him up until now. He's sort of skirted around it for a long time. But when you get the majority leader, what it's done is it's opened him up to attacks from the inside in a way that hadn't existed before. And that I think could have a corrosive effect.In other words, after Indiana people were flocking to him and saying all these nice things, and it was all going rather smoothly. That flocking and uniting and lining up for the train I think is now at least on hiatus, and it makes some of those who got on the train thinking twice. That I think is the lurking danger, because unless he can unite the rest of the party and can get at least a kind of neutrality out of other leading Republicans, it's going to be hard.BAIER: This meeting in park city, Utah said to not be a never-Trump organized event. They don't have anything, and essentially all parties are conceding there is no effort, there is no white knight. It's over. The party is going to have to deal with it.STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: It's awfully late. I don't think there ever really was much of an organized never-Trump movement for all the coverage that I got. I think it was mostly a bunch of people saying I don't want to vote for Donald Trump.I think Charles is right in one respect and I disagree with him in another. I think it may be the case that having these Republicans criticizing Trump does have some lasting effect. On the other hand, if you're a Trump voter or a Republican sitting at home, you've heard Democrats make these arguments about Republicans, about any number of Republicans, that they're sexist, they're racist, that they're misogynistic over the years, ad nauseam. And I think at a certain point people tune that stuff out. The difference with what Trump said this time I think is it was bigoted. It was a bigoted comment. He said it, made bigoted remarks first in February, then in a speech, then to ""The Wall Street Journal.""BAIER: Then a semi-apology today.HAYES: Repeatedly, repeatedly, in a CNN interview. I think he didn't recognize that what he said was bigoted.CARLSON: Well, I don't think there's any defending with a Trump said. On the other hand, it might have been worse. He might have come out for racial discrimination in hiring and in promotions and in contracting and in college admissions, and that would have put him on the same side as Hillary Clinton who explicitly favors that. Entire federal agencies are devoted to that. So it's not to defend Trump, but to put it in some perspective. This is the currency of the left. This is identity politics. That's just true. I'm sorry.BAIER: All right, we've got not a lot of time. We want to go, it's Friday, and you know what happens on Friday, we go to a place called Candidate Casino. But we've changed it to Vice President Candidate Casino. And today Elizabeth Warren huddled with Hillary Clinton. So let's start on the democratic side. Amy, $100 in chips, Democrats.WALTER: I want to start off by saying I've never picked a VP right, never. All my years -- I'm placing my bets. I'm terrible about this.I don't think it's going to be Elizabeth Warren, so I just put $5 on that. I think she's much better as an attack dog for Hillary Clinton than being on the ticket with her. I'm putting at the top Tim Kaine who is a safer choice but I think would be the kind of person Hillary needs. Her whole message is about stability and reaching out beyond that base. Tom Perez who is the labor secretary, Sherrod Brown, the senator from Ohio rounding it out.BAIER: Steve, Democratic side first?HAYES: I'm hedging here. That's basically what I'm doing. I put $15 on Julian Castro, $15 on Tim Kaine as a safe pick for somebody --(CROSSTALK)HAYES: Wait until we get to Republicans. It's even worse.BAIER: David Petraeus, that's an interesting call.HAYES: That was the last sort of crazy thought. I think she wants to run a safe campaign. I think she wants to provide a contrast with Donald Trump by being safe. I think most of these that I've listed are safe picks.BAIER: Tucker?CARLSON: I don't think she's wholly in charge of this decision. I think she wants to play it safe. I don't think she's allowed to. I think Elizabeth Warren is the favorite. I put $60 on her, and thepn Castro, $40.BAIER: Charles?KRAUTHAMMER: She puts Petraeus on there and that means we can abolish the classification system entirely if that's on the ticket.(LAUGHTER)  KRAUTHAMMER: Sorry, I couldn't help that.  I've narrowed it down. Really she has two choices. You're going to go center or go left. You go center, you go Kaine. You go left, you do either Sherrod Brown or Elizabeth Warren.BAIER: Republicans, Steve?HAYES: Again, hedging my bets, the only person I've got more than $10 on is Bob Corker. Then I've get $10 on Newt, on Sessions, Tim Scott, John Thune, Tom Cotton and Dennis Rodman. Sort of an out of the box pick, but Trump, he's famous. He is reality TV star. He's an experienced diplomat.BAIER: This is why you lose in Vegas. This is actually why you lose.(LAUGHTER)BAIER: All right, Amy?WALTER: I'm not much different from yours. I split it up too, with Bob Corker getting most of my votes. But I also put Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin in there. I think a woman would be a good pick for him. And then of course leaving the rest of it in the player to be determined later. I think it's going to be somebody who is not on this list.BAIER: Tucker.CARLSON: I believe it will be Chris Christie, so I put $80 on Chris Christie.BAIER: Eighty bucks?CARLSON: Eighty bucks.BAIER: That's decisive.CARLSON: I think it's true, I would actually bet $80 on it. I think Herman Cain and Ben Carson are a distant second.BAIER: Charles?KRAUTHAMMER: I've got Gingrich still up there despite his criticizing Trump. Christie, yes up there, then Scott Brown, John Thune, Jeff Sessions.BAIER: OK. Steve, you want five on Omarosa?HAYES: No. I'll take your $80 bet on Chris Christie.CARLSON: Done.HAYES: I've got the field, you got Christie.CARLSON: Wow.BAIER: We do this pretend. This is pretend.WALTER: This is going to get us FDIC problems.BAIER: We'll take chips.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

7	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/08/29/how-much-will-debates-impact-poll-numbers/	How much will the debates impact the poll numbers?	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" August 29, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)CAMPAIGN AD: In Hillary Clinton's America, the middle class gets crushed, spending goes up, taxes go up.In Donald Trump's America, working families get tax relief. Millions of new jobs created, wages go up. Small businesses thrive, the American dream achievable. Change that makes America great again.CAMPAIGN AD: He wears it like a crown, ""Make America great again."" But Trump made his shirts in Bangladesh, his ties in China, and his suits in Mexico.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Two ads going head to head. Donald Trump with a new ad and Hillary Clinton's ad over the past weekend, this the new ad buy, by the way, for the Trump campaign is said to be about $10 million in battleground states. This as a new poll out from Monmouth University shows Hillary Clinton with a seven-point lead over Donald Trump with the four candidates there.And that tracks roughly where our average of polls that we trust that we call the ""Special Report"" average of polls, the five most recent polls. It has that almost exactly the same number for all four, seven points.Let's bring in our panel: Syndicated columnist George Will; Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National Public Radio, and Tucker Carlson, host of ""Fox & Friends Weekend.""Mara, where do you put this race right now? As we get ready to head into post Labor Day ahead of the first debate, September 26th, where is this race?MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: I think that's where it is. She's got a substantial lead, five, six, seven points. That's where it's been. There is a theory about presidential campaigns that once you get into this part of the summer, the dynamic is pretty well set. And only a spectacular collapse or a fabulous performance in the debates or a big October surprise can change the dynamic. That's where I think the race is.BAIER: Tucker?TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS: Surprisingly close. Given that we used to say in campaigns, one candidate won the day. I can't remember the last day that Donald Trump can claim to have won. The press is united against him. He's had an awful lot of self-inflicted wounds, and yet he's still relatively close. She's definitely winning, of course. But their theory of the case that there's this large pool of secret Trump voters, people that are too embarrassed to say that they're voting for Trump, that becomes real if it gets within three points, I think. And we're not that far from it. I'm just saying it's going to get there. I'm just saying she is stubbornly below 50. That tells you a lot.BAIER: There are negatives on both candidates, obviously, George, they're very high. How much does that mean the impact of these debates will have?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, the debates are everything for Donald Trump, because he has to change the arithmetic. At this point she's winning all 11 of the classic battleground states. If she wins the Obama states, the 326 electoral votes. If she loses North Carolina as he did in 2012, she still wins comfortably. So she's ahead, but it might be fragile. And his challenge is to come on stage and rattle her, I assume, by saying that you studied hard, I didn't. You have mastered your briefing books. I don't know what they are. Let's rumble.BAIER: And that will make a difference in people's perception?LIASSON: I think it could make a difference. Donald Trump has to pass the plausibility test for people. He has to reassure people that they can imagine him being president, and beyond his base. And those people are not leaving him, no matter what he does or says. They are very, very loyal. He has to expand. That's what all of the indications coming out of the Trump campaign in the past week or two have said, that he wants to perhaps soften his stand on immigration, change what he wants to do to illegal immigrants in this country. That's a recognition that the base is not enough for him. He's got to make it bigger.BAIER: A possible change in this debate in the performance of both candidates, but also we mentioned other things can happen. We have this e- mail release that is scheduled for September 13. Over the weekend you had both sides talking about the e-mails and their impact.Maybe we don't. But they did talk about it. We did have a sound bite. And it was Citizens United saying these e-mails really show the foundation was in communication with the State Department, the Clinton Foundation, and the interaction of those. And then Donna Brazile saying this is no big deal, I can't even see where the smoke is, even though Hillary Clinton said I know there's smoke but there's no fire.LIASSON: I don't know where they get their metaphors.(LAUGHTER)CARLSON: You heard more of the same. You heard what we already knew. There was actually one of Hillary's employees working at the State Department and the foundation, so we knew there was this nexus between them. But you saw Doug Band, the president's body man, calling and asking for special treatment of Clinton donors and getting them.What you didn't see so strikingly is any Democrat saying this actually is bad. It's unethical. It reflects poorly not simply on Hillary Clinton and her campaign but on the U.S. government, on its competence and its ethics, and I'm out. You haven't seen what you've seen on the Republican side, including from someone at this table, lifelong Democrats, or in this case Republicans, saying I'm not for this anymore. This candidate is too flawed. Why haven't you? Because the Democratic Party is not an ideological party. It's a party whose only concern is acquiring and wielding power, and I think they revealed that in a way that's kind of shocking.BAIER: George?WILL: The Clintons have been in politics sense they got out of law school, which means they spent their entire adult life asking rich people for money. And that is over 20 or 30 or40 years corrosive. It corrodes among other things their sense of the little line that gets blurred to the point erasure between public and private interests. If you've read your Faulkner, you've read all about these folks. They are the Snopes, and get used to it.BAIER: Do you think this story has -- that the public has now fully digested the e-mail story to the point where even if some e-mail comes out September 13th, that they're going to be able to plow through it, depending on what it says?WILL: The e-mails are going to have to show a quid pro quo. It's going to have to show government action, not seating someone next to Joe Biden at a State Department lunch, but some government action that looks demonstrably corrupt.BAIER: But the fact that hundreds of hits on Benghazi, and these are the e-mails she said were personal that she deleted. We know that there are foundation emails in there. So obviously none of it is falling under just the yoga and wedding planning.LIASSON: No. It's had an effect. Why do you think her numbers on honesty and trustworthiness are as bad as they are? This is what's causing that. But I do think for it to change the dynamic of the race, to flip what's happening, not only would it have to be a quid pro quo, it would have to be something that would be otherwise contrary to U.S. policy, or she would have to have met with someone that an ordinary secretary of state, her or her predecessors would have met with.CARLSON: I guess, but what is the Hillary campaign about? I know, seriously. Is it about infrastructure? No. It's about getting power and passing around the fruits of that power to our friends and wielding it for good. That's it. That's not a rationale for a presidential campaign. And I think if she got any scrutiny at all, I'm not saying Trump would win, I'm not defending Trump. I'm merely saying the premise of her campaign is indefensible, and nobody points that out.LIASSON: She doesn't have a message for her campaign other than I'm not Donald Trump, and he's really dangerous and scary.BAIER: Because technically, George, this is a change election, it should be a change election if you look at the dynamics of election after election after election.WILL: It is. And it's a wonder at this point that Mr. Trump hasn't been able to take advantage of that. We just finished a lost decade in this country, a decade which we had not one year of three percent economic growth. The economy is not growing at all right now. And in this atmosphere, which cries out for change, the candidate who has been a national figure now for 20, 30 years, is ahead. It makes no sense.BAIER: We'll see what happens after Labor Day.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
