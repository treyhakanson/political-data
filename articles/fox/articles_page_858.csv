"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" January 25, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Bernie came in with the luxury of being a complete longshot and just letting loose. I think Hillary came in with the both privilege and burden of being perceived as the frontrunner.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If you look at the polling we've seen nationally, you can see the polling which is taking place here in Iowa and New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump. Guess what, Bernie Sanders does a lot better than Hillary Clinton does against Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Senator Sanders doing his best. Donald Trump talking about polls on the stump. We have some new polls out tonight. Here is the newest FOX News poll from Iowa in the Democratic race. Hillary Clinton up six. But you can you see she's lost since December, 2015. And there you see Sanders gaining on her. Then we go to New Hampshire, and the lead for Bernie Sanders is pretty astounding, 22 points in this latest poll out tonight. And nationally Hillary Clinton goes below 50 percent for the first time, and you see the spread.The issue that is leading here when asked about among Democratic primary voters, honest and trustworthy, 30 percent, right experience, 22 percent, cares about you, 17. Can win in November, only eight percent. There's some of the latest polls. Let's bring in our panel, syndicated columnist George Will, Juan Williams, columnist with ""The Hill,"" and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. OK, state of the Democratic race, George?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Close. Well, it's not close, actually, when you think about it. We only have two states to go by, and one of them is a landslide at this point. We have the president clearly weighing in at this point on Hillary for a number of good reasons. He knows that five out of six times the parties tried since the Second World War to extend from two to three terms, five of the six they failed. Most of his achievements, or many of them at any rate, are written on water because they're done by executive order, so it's particularly important to not have a Republican who can undo them as fast as he did them.And any time a president's party is turned out after his two terms, it's a mild repudiation. So I think he has his thumbs on the scales, and you can see why.BAIER: Juan, the president embracing Hillary Clinton. Is that a good thing for her, because, frankly, the motivation, the momentum in the Sanders campaign is pushing back about what the president didn't get done from the left, saying that he was a disappointment from the progressive point of view?JUAN WILLIAMS, THE HILL: Well, I think that's a legitimate point. But you've got to keep in mind if you're doing Hillary Clinton's strategy, you want Barack Obama's base. You want those young people. You want those minority voters. You want people who had been with the kind of energetic left that boosted President Obama past Hillary Clinton back in '08. And the question is, how do you recapture that momentum?BAIER: Let me interrupt you. The latest poll has the young voters 89 percent --WILLIAMS: Right.BAIER: -- going for Bernie Sanders.WILLIAMS: Correct. And so that's where I was going with this, that at the moment what you see is that those young voters are not plugging into Hillary Clinton. I would particularly point at young women, who you would think would identify with potentially the first woman president. They're not. And I think they don't know Hillary Clinton or they consider her yesterday's news.And what you're seeing with the Obama embrace, I think, is an opportunity for Hillary Clinton to point to Barack Obama and say to that base, don't forget. Your champion, the guy you like so much, his numbers are still very good among Democrats, like 80 percent, that he likes me.BAIER: Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I don't think Obama's inclinations as expressed, I thought rather mildly pro-Hillary, are a matter of affection. I think it's the fact that with her she has begun to wrap herself around him, around his legacy. You saw it in the last debate. She kept saying, Bernie's going to abandon Obamacare. I will continue it.Of course it's completely ironic because Sanders is the one who wants to achieve the ultimate dreams of Obama, the ones he couldn't. He was the one who openly said he would prefer a single payer system like the Canadian system, but he obviously wasn't able to achieve it. Sanders is the one who you would expect to be his logical ideological heir.But I think Obama is calculating that the country is simply not going to elect Sanders, and if Sanders loses, a Republican is elected, everything he did, almost everything he did, I think including Obamacare, disappears and he becomes a historical parenthesis. So what he I think is pushing for, he'd like to see, is any Democrat, meaning if it has to be Hillary, it will be Hillary, he thinks she has a better chance, so that legacy such as it is, is continued.BAIER: Meanwhile, it's his FBI and his Justice Department that really holds the key to whether Hillary Clinton wins or loses.KRAUTHAMMER: That's why I think less important than Iowa, less important than New Hampshire, is the Comey vote. He's the head of the FBI. His will be decisive. If he makes a criminal referral, I think their candidacy probably will disintegrate even if it's rejected by the Department of Justice.BAIER: Let's take a look at Michael Bloomberg, former New York mayor, talking to Neil Cavuto in 2014.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NEIL CAVUTO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Are you going to run for president?MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, (I) FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: No. This is a two party country. I suspect it will always be. I find it hard to see how a third party candidate could win. But in any case, in my future, it's my politics. My future is working a little bit at my company, a lot at my foundation, and trying to do other things. I do not believe that a third party candidate can win, and I can tell you categorically I am not running for president. You can rest assured that in two-and-a-half years when there is a presidential election, or two and a third years, I will vote. And I will vote for one of the parties of the two major candidates, two major parties.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Sometime between then and now, things changed. ""New York Times,"" ""Michael R. Bloomberg has instructed advisers to draw up plans for a potential independent campaign in this year's presidential race and has indicated to friends and allies that he would be willing to spend at least $1 billion of his fortune on it. Mr. Bloomberg commissioned a poll in December to see how he might fare against Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, and he intends to conduct another round of polling after the New Hampshire primary on February 9th to gage whether there is indeed an opening for him. If Republicans were to nominate Mr. Trump or Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a hardline conservative, and Democrats choose Mr. Sanders, Mr. Bloomberg, who changed his party affiliation to independent in 2007, has told allies he would be likely to run."" George?WILL: Well, Mr. Bloomberg has looked at the array, the menu of candidates, and decided that what the country needs now is a second bossy big government billionaire from the east side of Manhattan. He may be right. He may be wrong. We haven't elected a northeasterner for 56 years, Jack Kennedy in 1960. Since then we've rejected three Massachusetts nominees, Dukakis, Kerry, Mitt Romney. This time we could have four from the northeast, Clinton from New York, Sanders from Vermont, Trump and Bloomberg from the eastside of Manhattan.There's a record of New York mayors thinking the country wants to hear from them, and they don't. In 1972 John Lindsay, who started as a Republican, became a Democrat, entered the Democratic contest for president, got 1.2 percent of the primary vote that year. In September, 2007, Giuliani was 20 points ahead and had a third more money than Mitt Romney and John McCain combined. He spent $65 million and got one delicate. It didn't work.BAIER: Florida was the fireball back then. Didn't work. Juan, if he gets in, would he take from Democrats or Republicans?WILLIAMS: I think he'd take a little bit from both, if you just have x Democrat column and y Republican column. But the fact is he's counting on extremes. He's counting on people perceiving Trump or Cruz and Sanders as extremes.BAIER: Or a wounded Clinton.WILLIAMS: Right. And then allowing him to come up the middle.BAIER: The one thing that's really interesting is if he does get in and no one gets to the magic number of 270 electoral votes, the race then goes to the House of Representatives. Each state gets one vote. And because of the way it's figured with Republicans in control, one would assume that the Republicans would take that.KRAUTHAMMER: Well, number one, that's every journalist's dream. All of this hope that there will be decided in the House before we die. Just watch. That's all we ask for. The other is Bloomberg entering, whether in the convoluted way of the House deciding or just straight up and down, he will help elect a Republican. He will take far more from the Democrat than form the Republican. And I think it could be decisive.WILL: The most important election, arguably in world history was settled that way in the House. It was 1800, the first time in the history of the world power had been peacefully transferred from one party to another. Jefferson is elected, the House did its job. And I kind of like the idea. You're doing it in the House where Wyoming is equal to California.BAIER: There you go. It could happen. You heard it here first.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" October 24, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Hello, I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle along with Juan Williams, Eric Bolling, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""Here we go. The final two weeks -- thanks Greg, have arrived and we are 15 days out from Election Day. And though Trump trails Clinton by five points in the latest average of national polls, he remains extremely confident that he can pull off a victory.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Just in case you haven't heard, we're winning, not only Florida but we're going to win the whole thing. Early voting in Florida begins today through the 5th, so make sure you get out and vote. Who has voted already? That's not bad. Well, you can do it early, because if you are not feeling well on the 8th of November, we don't want to take a chance. But if you are not feeling well, get up and vote, who cares, right?(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right. Republican nominee is laser focused on Florida, the nation's largest battleground where he currently trails Clinton by four points. He's holding five rallies there in three days. A lot of pollsters and pundits have tried to count him out, but his campaign knows he can clinch 270, the magic number of electoral votes needed to win the White House.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Our path is Florida, Ohio, Iowa, North Carolina, you add Nevada there. You protect Arizona and Georgia. You look at New Hampshire and Maine, too where the congressional districts there are split in the way there were the electoral votes and then we're also going to continue to visit Colorado, Virginia, Pennsylvania. The fact is that this race is not over. Many in the media want to say it's over for the 12th time. They're counting Donald Trump out. We're not giving up. We know we can win this and we are certainly not exceeding to the same chattering class that's been wrong about Donald Trump for about a year and a half.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: OK. So Kellyanne, obviously, was very busy over the weekend and last week, and talking about this chattering class. Eric, people -- the naysayers to say that Trump can't get it done, we've -- obviously, we updated our read there to say it's 5 percent now based on the RealClear Politics average of polls, so that included the CNN poll that just came out. So how do you see the numbers?ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: So --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Again, you have to look -- she's right about you have to win Florida and Ohio and North Carolina; must win states. If you don't win there, then it's over -- the game is over no matter. There's literally no path if you don't win those three. And then there's a combination of either Pennsylvania, either Michigan or a couple of the smaller states that would give you a potential path. But those are must -- three must wins and they're all within -- Ohio, they are dead tied, Florida, he sat down by four, but that could go either way because that's within margin of error -- North Carolina margin of error. Again, but here's the thing I see. I keep hearing -- like today, right before we came on air, I was watching -- it was Clinton campaign talking about stepping up their transition team. Really, you are counting the win already? You have 15 days away. These polls as strong with like one thing can change, you know, massive momentum and direction. And you are stepping up your transition team meaning, you're gonna like to take over soon. You are already to start taking over. Come on. This is -- it's not over yet towards the end of the show. And stick around, I'm going to tell you how these polls work, how internals -- you have to dig deep into the internals of polls to really understand the polls. It's anyone's game right now.GUILFOYLE: All right. So Dana, what do you think of these latest developments? And is the race tightening, you know, 15 days left? How does it look to you?DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: There's not a lot of time for it to tighten.GUILFOYLE: No.PERINO: And I would say that the lead is pretty substantial. I mean five points is a lot to try to close, but it -- I'm not going to say it's impossible. And I think also -- I think on Friday when he was at that rally, then he had the debate, then he had the Al Smith dinner on Friday when he was giving a speech, and he might, might have called it a rally. He didn't seem all that high energy to me. But I think the weekend did him some good and if you saw him there in Florida, he's funny, he's engaged with his crowd. They have extremely enthusiastic rallies. The one thing that they don't have that the Clinton team has in spades and this is also not just the Trump campaign but the RNC versus the DNC, is staff and mobilization. So now, as he was saying, how many -- he asked how many people have voted. And we're going to talk a little bit later about Katy Perry going to Nevada. And so she like trying -- make sure people can vote because early voting is really important, especially for democrats. Democrats seem to really like early voting. Republicans, traditionally love to show up on that day. But the military ballots that are coming back right now look pretty good for Trump in Florida. But in North Carolina, the democrats have done a really good job. So, it might be a jump ball, but I think it right now .GUILFOYLE: Oh.PERINO: . that the Hillary Clinton team .GUILFOYLE: I like that.PERINO: . is probably wrong to voice their cockiness.GUILFOYLE: Uh-huh.PERINO: But I would not blame them for planning ahead.GUILFOYLE: All right. Well, if you are into like superstition sayings, magic, unicorns, charms -- maybe it's too, too soon to call it and say, hey, we're ready for our transition thing.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Anything could happen.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: Anything could happen. An asteroid could hit .GUILFOYLE: I knew it.GUTFELD: . and Trump could have the solution.PERINO: I hope it does.GUTFELD: He could have the solution that saves earth. And then he becomes the greatest president we've ever had. Polls --GUILFOYLE: This happens in movies.GUTFELD: It did. Polls are like Play-Doh. From wishful thinkers, you can form and shape and you indulge any desire you want. But what are these pollsters do when the election is over? They are like cicadas, you know, they just show up every four years, they are all over the place and then they go back into some cave somewhere.PERINO: They make enough money. They don't have to work every year --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Yeah, they spend it on --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: They start working on the mid-term election.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: That 2018 could be a monster year for the republican.GUTFELD: Imagine if they applied polling to your life, like your marriage. Your --GUILFOYLE: Oh.GUTFELD: Your favorability, it's -- would be like 15 under. You have to decide whether you buy flowers or a ring every single day. It realistically would drive you crazy. That's why I'm sick of hearing these polls. It's like constantly checking the roast in the oven. That's not how you cook a roast.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Yes. Oh, there you go.GUILFOYLE: I don't picture you as a big chef (inaudible), but OK. Yeah.GUTFELD: I like --GUILFOYLE: I like --GUTFELD: I like a good can of noodles.GUILFOYLE: (inaudible) All right. So Juan, how do you see this? Because now, you know, it's a little bit closing up, but again, Dana says, you know look, it's not a lot of time left.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Not a lot of time. And I think the polls have been pretty consistent. There's not been a poll yet, in terms of the big polls that show Trump anywhere near Hillary Clinton or Hillary Clinton trailing. So the key here, I think is to look at what the most reputable polls show and then you can go to people, like I was on Fox News Sunday yesterday with Carl Rove. Rove says, ""Unless Trump is able to pull what he called an inside straight, he doesn't see any way to victory."" David Axelrod, so these last two winning, you know, campaign managers, Axelrod and Rove. Axelrod says he does -- doesn't see any way that Trump does it right now. So I think that's fair. But I do think that with -- on one hand you say Kimberly, it's two weeks left. Not much time. But as Greg points out, anything can happen.GUILFOYLE: Anything can happen.WILLIAMS: You don't know what happens. And you know WikiLeaks is out there. Trump is a very -- I mean, he's hope -- he'll do wild things every minute. I thought he had an opportunity in Gettysburg to say something about drain the swamp, his new slogan. Instead he said he is going to sue 11 women and just revive that issue and drown out his own message.GUTFELD: That's the next block Juan.WILLIAMS: Oh, I'm --GUILFOYLE: Geez. Sorry Juan, jump the shark before we could drain the swamp. All right --(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Yeah. Hillary Clinton --GUTFELD: Swamp shark.GUILFOYLE: I love the swamp people, though. Hillary Clinton campaigns in another swing state today, New Hampshire, it's a big one. And although she says she doesn't think about responding to Trump anymore, she had a lot to say about her opponent earlier.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: He has been denigrating America for decades. It started before he ran against me. It started before President Obama took office. In fact, back in 1987, he spent a hundred thousand dollars on an ad in the New York Times criticizing President Reagan. He said, and I quote, ""The world is laughing at America."" Does that sound familiar?CROWD: Yeah.CLINTON: This is someone who roots for failure and takes glee in mocking our country no matter who our president is.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: OK. How about Clinton's messaging right now Dana?PERINO: Well, I think --GUILFOYLE: How is she doing?PERINO: I get it. She's like on a stump speech and stuff. But if she really is as cocky as they are progressing, then why not have a little joy? Have some fun, you know.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: Get out there and have a good time, like everybody behind her was like -- we're so mad. I just, you know, she's -- have a little more fun on the trail.GUILFOYLE: Lack of enthusiasm or kind of --PERINO: I don't know -- I don't think that her voters are not enthusiastic --GUILFOYLE: No, from Hillary.PERINO: Oh, from her?GUILFOYLE: She doesn't seem so --PERINO: I just feel like she could have a little more fun.BOLLING: I will tell you what.PERINO: Oh, it's a good --BOLLING: I'll tell you what --PERINO: . to hear about that.GUILFOYLE: I'll tell you what?BOLLING: Besides being a great show Sunday, I'll tell you what. Do you see Elizabeth Warren right there? She introduced Hillary Clinton .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: She was good.GUILFOYLE: And they weren't in matching jackets.BOLLING: The republicans are very lucky that Elizabeth Warren is not the vice-presidential pick or even the nominee at this point.PERINO: That she's good.BOLLING: She really has it going on.PERINO: Yeah.BOLLING: I got to tell you, you just engage, you know, I disagree with every single thing she stands for. But I have to tell, she delivers it with a passion and the intensity that Barack Obama did.PERINO: And she's not afraid to say some things like -- Trump-like things.BOLLING: Yeah.PERINO: You know she like --GUILFOYLE: She gets after it.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: . women today.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, she gets after, and when she goes on her Twitter thing, the two of them go back and forth. It has been a while since that happened.GUTFELD: But this is the hypocrisy of the left. You know the -- she's talking about the denigrating nature of Donald Trump. What she's really talking about is how the right has learned from the left. You know, I always talk about how the right thinks and the left feels, but this is an advancement that the, that the right has somehow stolen Saul Alinsky, Saul Alinsky tactics from the left. This is a new generation of active, you know, voters. And I think that, I think the left are fearful to see that they're no, they no longer corner the turf in anger and in dirty tricks. I mean Trump is as dirty as they are. And I think that kind of, that kind of threw them off. And I think you are going to see that in the future.GUILFOYLE: All right, all right. Dana, I just realized that you are sitting on a unicorn pillow .GUTFELD: That's my pillow.GUILFOYLE: . that is likely communicating with this unicorn.PERINO: You know that I had used this pillow every day since we've been on the show.GUILFOYLE: I never saw that spike sticking out until now.GUTFELD: That was a gift from a ""Red Eye"" fans from many years ago.PERINO: That was --GUILFOYLE: DP gifts don't go to waste. Mine, I eat. All right, over the weekend -- it's true. They're all food. Over the weekend, Trump unveiled his contract with the American voter, a 100 day action plan to make America great again. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: In Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, this weekend, not far from the site where Abraham Lincoln delivered his (inaudible) America to unite, not divide. Donald Trump presented a contract with the American voter, an outline of how he would bring honesty, accountability and change to Washington, D.C. in his first 100 days in office. Here is some of his action plan to make America great again.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: A constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of congress.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: A five-year ban on White House and congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: To totally renegotiate NAFTA. Cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia. I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my administration. Middle class tax relief and simplification act. The repeal and replace ObamaCare Act .(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: . and illegal Immigration Act.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Fully funds the construction of a wall on our southern border. Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a wall.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Middle class and corporate tax cut, school choice, congressional term women, cutting, funding the sanctuary cities. Are these are exile, conservative ideas? Fifteen days left. KG, we just --GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: We just got breaking news alert. The ObamaCare premiums will go up .GUILFOYLE: Double digits.BOLLING . double digits confirmed by the White House. He is talking about replacing, repealing and replacing ObamaCare, 15 days. Did this contract with America do enough to sway voters?GUILFOYLE: Well, listen. I mean it was definitely a start. A lot of people were very positive about it because it is some specific policy proposals, ideas, things that he would pledge to do. People like a commitment. They like to know which way the ship is steering -- ask the Titanic. And then -- yeah, what happened was further proof that ObamaCare should be repealed and replaced because of the house of lies that it was built on. You couldn't keep your doctor. Now all the premiums going up, double digit, it's not created any kind. It's like fair market atmosphere for people to be able to try to get cheaper insurance. You've got, in many states, one choice, maybe two. That's not the principle this country was founded on. We need to be competitive. I want to fight for the business that Greg has. I'm going to offer a better price and a smile. So that's what -- that's the idea.BOLLING: Opposition.GUILFOYLE: I think it's good, because he can say, see, this is something that we need to do. Don't put her in. She's part of his deal and his administration. Look what they -- the mess they have brought.BOLLING: They're about 15 or 20 initiatives that he talked about promising that he was going to start right away -- wide ranging, too much, too much?PERINO: Well, I think the substance might have been great. It's just -- it feels very late and .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: . it was given on a Saturday. And I also felt like he was pretty shackled in the delivery, right? That wasn't the Donald Trump that you are dying to see because he's so entertaining. But substance-wise, pretty standard conservative republican fare, even though I am not for -- term limits, but that's could be a subject for another day. The trade thing and it probably bothers a lot of republicans. But I don't think it set him up as the change candidate that he has branded himself as, but I don't know if that necessary matters. But I also don't think that we can avoid two things. One, ""USA Today"" last week had a poll that they did or a study. The number one fear for Americans was government corruption and it surprised me. It was like 60 percent of Americans, that was their number one fear. So when he is talking about the things about Washington and just cleaning up Washington and drain the swamp, I think that probably plays very well. Unfortunately, there are more democrats than there are republicans in the country. And that's why republicans have to win a disproportionate number of independents in order to win national elections like this.GUILFOYLE: You (inaudible) on the base --PERINO: And finally, I would say that we can't ignore the other thing that he did in that speech, which was he stepped right in back on women are -- the women who have accused him of sexual assault are liars and he's going to sue them. So the ""New York Post"" the next morning had this great picture of him. It's such huge substance -- substantive speech by Donald Trump. Oh, and he is going to sue all the women. So like the (inaudible) and I thought, you just stepped on his great message.BOLLING: I was going to save that for Juan, but you start to hang on there, big guy. So he spent -- Donald Trump spent 10 minutes on attacking Hillary and talking about what Dana was just talking about, and 20 minutes on the policy. Do you like to see the 20-minute speech?GUTFELD: You know, he mentioned deregulation -- yeah. Very specific about deregulation, about for every, for every new law you get rid of two; cancelling payments to the U.N., climate change program. Fantastic --school choice, community policing. So my question -- where have you been all my life? Prince --GUILFOYLE: Right here.GUTFELD: Prince -- no. Prince --(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Prince charming finally shows up and the ball was almost over. And Snow White left with Lil Wayne. I mean this is like, you know I commend it. I thought the speech was great. I commend whoever wrote it for him. I've been screaming for these specifics since October 22, 2015. And it's just a bummer because now all this good stuff is overshadowed by the bad stuff. And I think it's too late. And you think about undecided voter, are they even listening to him at this point?BOLLING: Are they?GUTFELD: That's the bummer.BOLLING: Are they?WILLIAMS: No. I think you know most people have made up their mind by this point, certainly independents and democrat. The question is for Trump, can he get republicans back? I think he is still underperforming with republicans. This is very interesting to me, it's almost like that's where the race is, especially among educated young women but also men, because he is getting -- he's underperforming now even with white men. What struck me about this was, it was like grievance, grievance, grievance. So they were (inaudible) --GUTFELD: Like democrats.WILLIAMS: With this? Yeah, maybe. But I mean this is what's coming from Trump. I mean he is just like the media is at fault. Everybody is out to get me, he still feuding with Paul Ryan. That's not going to help you republicans, a feud with Paul Ryan. You know when he was down in Florida, he doesn't mention Marco Rubio. He is staying away from Marco Rubio. I just got to think that -- I mean, to my mind, I was reading Michael Goodwin the ""New York Post"" today --BOLLING: I saw that.WILLIAMS: And he is saying, too. You know, this is just like complaint, whine and grievance.BOLLING: Well --WILLIAMS: You know, I guess it might stir some in his base, but if that's what he is doing .GUTFELD: But grievances is --WILLIAMS: . he is not running for president anymore.GUTFELD: Grievances have worked for the Democratic Party since they invented it.GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: Yeah, but let me just say, he is not running for president anymore, that's what -- I mean, because at this point, all he is doing is appealing to the hardcore of his own --BOLLING: For the, for the first 10 minute, which is the grievances that you point out, and then the next 20 minutes he hit policy. It was straight policy, top to bottom for 20 minutes straight, so --WILLIAMS: That's not gonna --BOLLING: He can make the case and that speech was for both.WILLIAMS: You know it read to me -- first of all, what struck -- stuck with me was he is going to sue the women. Which I think is just like he's, you know, reopening his own wound. He is picking off the scab. But the second thing stuck with me was like a laundry list, but didn't strike like me was invested in anyone specific thing.BOLLING: All right. We have to leave it there. Ahead, more pay-to-play excuses from Hillary Clinton's team, her campaign manager stumbling on questions about that $12 million check from the king of Morocco; money the secretary personally negotiated herself. That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Hillary Clinton's campaign manager appeared on ""Fox News Sunday"" yesterday and tried his hardest to dismiss the pay-to-play revelations from one of the latest WikiLeaks e-mail drops. Robby Mook addressed that $12 million check from the king of Morocco, negotiated by the Secretary herself, right before she step into the race.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBBY MOOK, HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Well, first of all, it's not news that the Clinton Global Initiative had their meeting in Morocco, everybody knew that, and it's also not news that Hillary Clinton didn't go to it.CHRIS WALLACE, ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY"" HOST: But Robby, there -- there is some news. You were not happy at all with the idea of this meeting and her going there at that particular point.MOOK: Well, I didn't want anything on her schedule that was just going to distract from the campaign. But again, this is -- these are stolen documents, stolen by the Russians.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: And that elicited this follow-up question from Chris Wallace.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: The Trump tax returns were stolen as well, when they were mailed to ""The New York Times."" You guys didn't object to that. In fact, you jumped all over.MOOK: Well, we don't know where those tax returns come from.WALLACE: They weren't -- it was clearly stolen.MOOK: We don't know and you have --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Do you think Trump had given them?MOOK: I don't know. I don't know how they got to ""The New York Times.""WALLACE: I guess that's what I'm saying --MOOK: But --WALLACE: If that -- if we're looking at the fruits of that theft -- and I will call it a theft -- but it's fair to look at the fruits of your theft.MOOK: Well, I think --(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Greg, a little bit of intellectual honesty.GUTFELD: Well, no. This is an interesting point that they both brought up. Were these tax returns stolen? If they were stolen, that's a pretty big deal.GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: That means somebody went into an office, stole these tax returns and released them. And that's -- to me, as big as Watergate.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Look, Trump didn't release them, so .GUTFELD: What --PERINO: I would say --GUTFELD: No, no, no. We have to ask him. No, it's --PERINO: Well --GUTFELD: Well, no. Their other --PERINO: Yeah, you are right. I don't know who sent them to Trump Tower.GUTFELD: There's another person who signs the tax releases, who he is married to at the time. That could have been the release. If it's an -- even if it's accountant, that's still theft. I mean he's -- I'm surprised that one has tried to investigate this, because this is a huge deal. If the democrats stole this --GUILFOYLE: That supposedly they are .(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: . investigating.GUTFELD: I also want to defend the king of Morocco because .GUILFOYLE: OK.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Are you headed there?GUTFELD: I'm headed there for a short vacation. King Mohammed VI in a televise speech once said, ""The terrorists are destined to dwell in hell for all eternity,"" and he what? And he added, ""Can anyone of sound mind believe that the rewards for Jihad are virgins in paradise?"" That's a Muslim leader who's got .PERINO: That we should embrace.GUTFELD: . some guts. I don't know anything else about him.GUILFOYLE: And you also once again, for the fact that it was a ripped off because he paid for Hillary Clinton and got Bubba and Chelsea.GUTFELD: True.GUILFOYLE: This poor man. Thank God you are standing up for him.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: He doesn't even have any money at all.GUTFELD: He's only got $50.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: I imagine that Kimberly, when she was thinking that she was about to leave the State Department, she thinks, ""I can get $12 million for the Clinton Global Initiative."" She probably didn't give it much thought that on, looking back as Bob Woodward said yesterday. It's corruption.GUILFOYLE: It is corruption and she gets to pass for that. I don't understand. She's always looking to get over on somebody. It runs in the family. So she is like, let me see if I can get some cash, you know, quick cash out of here like, you know, the ATM. That's what they do.WILLIAMS: Yeah, it was totally -- this is total crazy.GUILFOYLE: No, it's not total crazy.WILLIAMS: Let me just say, that you have a --GUILFOYLE: That's what we have to see what happened.WILLIAMS: Can I just (inaudible) in a second --GUILFOYLE: She negotiated in her own --- well, I wasn't finished speaking--WILLIAMS: I know it will pain you, but I'll speak for a second.GUILFOYLE: I wasn't finished speaking, actually.WILLIAMS: She's left. She's no longer secretary of state. She is legitimately trying to raise money for her family foundation and she commits to give a speech because they'll be running.PERINO: Not everyone knew she was going to run for president.WILLIAMS: Then, when she -- when it becomes apparent to Robby Mook and the whole campaign -- wait a second, this is going to raise lots of questions. It could look bad. She pulls out. So she doesn't give the speech.GUILFOYLE: It's not that innocent.WILLIAMS: To me, that's -- so that's chaos. That's confusion and there's an e-mail that says she created this mess. She created it potentially because she was trying to raise money for her family foundation. What's so corrupt about that?BOLLING: While she was secretary of state?WILLIAMS: No, she wasn't. She had left.BOLLING: I don't understand the $12 million check came after she was -- this deal...WILLIAMS: No, no, no. She was going to give the speech after she left.BOLLING: I understand that, Juan, but the negotiations started while she was secretary of state.WILLIAMS: Her time after she left the office, Eric.BOLLING: OK. And if you know you're going to run for president, you don't think that would be...GUILFOYLE: And that's why her staff was upset.WILLIAMS: She had a window. There's no impropriety involved.GUILFOYLE: That's why Huma said, ""She knows what she did. She created this mess.""WILLIAMS: ... she could have gone and given the speech as a citizen.BOLLING: Can I make a point? I don't think selling access to the secretary of state or the former president is an issue or a problem, for that matter. I think it goes on all the time.What I have a problem with is when these things turn into deals. So a country buys access to meet with the president or the secretary of state. OK. I get it. It happens. And then a deal. Then a deal is struck later with that foreign government and some business dealings over here.What happens is, the people who are on this side donating to the Clinton Foundation, G.E., Boeing, numerous companies end up doing deals. And that precludes anyone else who might have done that deal. It's...GUILFOYLE: Pay-for-play.BOLLING: But even worse. It's killing competition for companies that want to...WILLIAMS: You know who the big donor was? Donald Trump. Donald Trump was a big donor to the Clinton Foundation. So what you're saying is that the Clintons know the rich...GUILFOYLE: Why do you think -- why do you think he donated?WILLIAMS: No. That's your allegation. I'm saying I don't know who got access or not. My problem with the Clinton Foundation is that...BOLLING: You don't listen. That's the problem.WILLIAMS: I listen to you carefully. In fact, sometimes it makes me nuts. But I'm telling you, I listen. And I'm telling you right now, the problem is that the political image that comes from this is open to questions of quid pro quo and corruption. But as we know as we sit here, 16 or 17 days from the election, nothing, zero has been proven on this front.PERINO: It's actually 15 days.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Look, I think -- hasn't FOX given money to the Clinton Foundation? I haven't gotten any quid pro quo since this happened. They've given money to the -- where is my quid?BOLLING: Again, the donors...GUILFOYLE: You have no cash.BOLLING: When there's a backside deal that happens and someone else may be trying to do that deal. And they get the deal because they made the donation. Therein lies the different.GUILFOYLE: Why doesn't everybody donate as well to the Clinton Foundation? OK, you can do some good. But also it's a good idea if somebody likes to do deals. If you're somebody like Trump, you would donate to the Clinton Foundation, because it pays to be tight with the Clintons.PERINO: And it was -- and Donald Trump himself said that. That's why he did it.All right. Another issue for Hillary, connecting with younger voters. Two pop stars tried to help her out by popping by some dorm rooms on her behalf this weekend. Miley and Katy's campus campaign. That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: As Election Day looms like a sack of spoiled food tied to a hobo's stick, the Dems are pulling out all the stops, and starlets, as well. As Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry -- don't know them -- visit campus dorms to rouse Millennials to vote for Hillary.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)KATY PERRY, POP STAR: Are you voting this year?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.PERRY: Who are you voting for?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Clinton.PERRY: Yes!Well, you know what the good thing about it, is that I can actually use my voice. It's great, because you can use all of that attention for good. Like we're doing here today. We can change the world.MILEY CYRUS, POP STAR: I'm going door to door right now in support of Hillary.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.CYRUS: And are you registered to vote?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am.CYRUS: All I want is a president we're happy to be sharing. It's all I want. Hillary, come on. I went dorm to dorm dressed like the Statue of Liberty. Come on. You have to be happy to be here.(END VIDEOTAPE)GUTFELD: Shoot me.Behold the liberal nexus: celebs and dorm dwellers, who both share the same political beliefs: a naive view of pacifism, animal rights and shouty platitudes written in erasable ink on their faces. Makes sense: When you're young or famous, you never have to connect any dots between belief and behavior, between truth and consequences. You're either really, really rich or mom and dad are footing the bill.For celebrities it's far worse. The arrested development that comes with early fame creates a loathing insecurity about their own intellectual death. Liberalism is the soothing ointment. For a student it's just easier to fit in mouthing all that crud.But before we mock them, consider the Republican counterparts. The doom [SIC] -- the dorms, they get Miley and Katy. The conservatives get Chuck Norris and Ted Nugent. See, we have stars, too. They're just older. I guess it takes celebrities decades to see the error of their ways.But what's really ironic is how these outspoken pop singers fail to see the stereotype they gladly fill. Their assimilation into cultish obedience to leftism is so swift. How rebellious is that? And what of our greatest rebel? Last week Madonna promised to have sex with you if you vote for Hillary, which could be why Hillary's lead just shrunk.Among other things...PERINO: Is that true?GUTFELD: Yes. Don't you watch the news?PERINO: Well, not that.GUTFELD: Well, since you're already speaking, would your vote -- would you change your vote if somebody like Justin Bieber, who you're a fan of...PERINO: Dierks Bentley.GUTFELD: That's why I didn't say him.PERINO: OK. If Justin Bieber came in, no.GUTFELD: No? Knocked on your door.PERINO: I just never really -- I've never been a celebrity obsessed. Right? I'm kind of shy around it.GUILFOYLE: Wait a second.GUTFELD: No, you stalk.GUILFOYLE: Dierks Bentley. Are you kidding me?PERINO: Just one.GUILFOYLE: Everyone knows. It's on open secret.PERINO: Other than that, no, I'm not persuaded in that way.BOLLING: What do you think, Eric.PERINO: For a Republican, if we had that kind of star power, would we use it?BOLLING: We do. Steven Baldwin. We have the best Baldwin.GUTFELD: The best Baldwin brother.BOLLING: Alec Baldwin even admitted it.Look, I think it's a brilliant strategy. I think hitting the college campuses is genius, because not only do you have a captive audience, they are young, they probably haven't voted before, they are probably just registered. I told you about the story of my son walking onto campus, and there was 200 people registering college freshmen, brand-new 18-year-olds. And they're all Hillary Clinton supporters doing it. It's a great strategy. And you'll have them for life, probably. You'll have them for at least until they start paying their taxes.GUTFELD: Yes, yes.BOLLING: Great strategy.GUTFELD: What about you, Juan? Is this a great strategy? Is there any celebrity that would make you change your vote?WILLIAMS: Well, the biggest celebrity that I've seen ever was Oprah Winfrey for Barack Obama.But I must say, from what I've read, it doesn't make any difference. I mean, most people just really don't react. So the value is in what we're doing right here, which is that it echoes across the media that you get Katy Perry or Miley Cyrus.GUTFELD: You play into it.WILLIAMS: Right. So everybody says, oh, my gosh, look who -- you know, this little hot media star is out there doing it. And I think they think it's good for them and makes them look virtuous. But does it really move votes? I would be surprised.GUTFELD: Kimberly, I was talking to Kellyanne Conway, a friend of mine. And she mentioned could Miley and Katy be hitting the campuses, because they're worried about the polls?GUILFOYLE: Listen, I don't...GUTFELD: Not that they (UNINTELLIGIBLE).GUILFOYLE: I was so confused. You know, I think they should be worried. Because until the votes are counted, it's certified and it's a done deal, you know, and she's getting ready for her, you know, acceptance speech, I don't think that they should count anything out at all. So of course, they're going to utilize any asset they have, especially to create some enthusiasm with young people and millennials.Because nobody is hiding the fact that she hasn't been able to get the kind of support and enthusiasm that Barack Obama is able to generate when he goes out and to speak or even Bernie Sanders...GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: ... or even Elizabeth Warren. So they're missing that special sauce in the HRC campaign. So they need the people to be, like, ""I'm with her.""WILLIAMS: You know what I got a kick out of on this story, was reading that people Susan Sarandon, Cornell West, Oliver Stone, they're not Clinton people.GUTFELD: No.WILLIAMS: They're all going with, like, Jill Stein.GUILFOYLE: Why are you surprised by that?GUTFELD: She's not left wing enough. It's just scary.PERINO: I think the other thing I was going to say is I think the strategy also is that Hillary Clinton's team, if they think that they're going to win, and they're cocky as we were saying earlier, they want that win to be so overwhelming. So they're going to make sure everybody that they can find to go out and vote.But then, in a bigger context, you know what progressives want to do. They have a longer-term vision. So they want to get these young voters. And if it turns out that whoever you vote for in your first two elections is usually who you will vote for, for the rest of your life.GUTFELD: I voted for Thor.GUILFOYLE: By the way, solid choice.GUTFELD: Thank you. Thank you. It was a write in.GUILFOYLE: How is he voting?GUTFELD: I have no idea. We're going to move on now, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Do it.GUTFELD: All right. We've all been focused on the presidential race. But there are also intense battles under way for control of the Senate. The race that could tip the balance of power next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: It's not just the White House up for grabs on November 8. Republicans fiercely fighting to hold onto their majority in the Senate. Half a dozen states could go either way on election day. New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Indiana, Missouri and North Carolina.Here are both presidential nominees on those critical races.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: But you have to get out and vote. And that includes helping me re-elect Republicans all over the place. I hope they help me, too. Be nice if they help us, too, right?HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: And that's why we need leaders like Maggie. And unlike her opponent, she has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump. She knows he shouldn't be a role model for our kids or for anybody else, for that matter.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Kimberly, this is a money story in these last two weeks. What we're seeing right now is people who -- on the Republican side who aren't giving to Trump, the big donors, they're putting money into a last minute surge to try to maintain the Republican majority in the Senate.On the Democratic side, the Clinton campaign has just put in $2.5 million, Democratic Senate and the House campaigns. They're putting $6 million money up for ads in battleground states. This is the big fight, it turns out.GUILFOYLE: And if makes sense, doesn't it, given the dynamic and what's gone on and developed? But the fact of the matter is, if you're putting big money and dumping it in to get your candidate in and your party's candidate in, well, they're going to go, they're going to vote, hopefully. And then, more than likely, they'll pick the other like-minded and same ticket person. So ""OK, I'm going there to support Marco Rubio"" and also then more likely to support Donald Trump and go GOP down the line or go Democratic down the line. So I don't think it's totally counterproductive or counterintuitive.WILLIAMS: You know, one of the big surprises we just saw, Hillary Clinton there in New Hampshire, and she was campaigning with Governor Maggie Hasan -- Hasan against Kelly Ayotte. Now, what we've seen is that since Ayotte made her statement about Trump as a role model for kids, her numbers have gone down. What do you think?BOLLING: Me? It's an important seat for McCain, Portman. These are all important. They make a very important point. Nevada, the open seat. Harry Reid left the seat open. That's why Joe Heck in Nevada is very important.So if you don't like Trump and you do -- and you are conservative, get out and vote and vote for Trump or don't vote for Trump, even vote for Hillary, but vote for the Republican on the Senate ballot. Heck is an important one.A lot of people are actually doing that. ""60 Minutes"" did a thing in Ohio last night, and they talked to a staunch Republican who said, ""I can't vote for Trump. I might even be able to vote for Hillary. But I'm going to go to the polling place, and I'm going to go ahead, not vote for Trump, but I'm voting for Portman. I'm going to make sure this happens.""And this is what you're going to get. You could get a Hillary presidency, and you have a Senate and House...WILLIAMS: Let me just...BOLLING: ... that blocks her...WILLIAMS: On that point, Dana, that was your point earlier.GUILFOYLE: Why not put a Republican in?WILLIAMS: That there are a number of people who are saying, ""Well, if Hillary is going to win, we don't want her to have a rubber stamp. I think a lot of the Republican ads right now say don't give Hillary a rubber stamp by giving her a Democratic majority in the Senate.PERINO: And there's precedent for that. In 1996 when Bob Dole was at a place in sort late October it was quite clear that he was not going to win, he put all of his efforts into trying to help the House and Senate stay in Republican hands.And Robert Samuelson, a syndicated columnist, wrote today that -- what Eric was saying, that if you find that you can't vote at the top of the ticket, at least make sure that you do something at least for the Republicans below. So there's precedent for it. and we might see that.And actually, some of those races where there was big landslides, like in 1984, the Democrats actually picked up seats in the Senate. So Reagan won huge, but the Democrats won in the Senate.I will tell you one race I'm going to watch closely is Indiana. Todd Young is a congressman there, conservative. And he's running against former Senator Evan Bayh.GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: I think the Democrats got really cocky. They thought we'll just send Evan Bayh back in there. He'll be able to pick it back up. But it looks like Young has him on the ropes.GUILFOYLE: That will be an interesting race to watch.WILLIAMS: The other race that's so surprising -- I was going to cite just that one in Indiana Dana just talked about -- is Missouri. Roy Blount, who I thought was a shoo-in, but actually, he's now in a very close race with Jason Candler. Big surprise to me that the Republicans are up against it in a very red state, Missouri.GUTFELD: Why is it always about race?Look, if the Republicans lose the Senate and lose the president -- the White House, America is doomed. Make no mistake. It's over.PERINO: Turn out the lights.GUTFELD: Buy gold. Buy silver. Buy a My Pillow. Buy a reverse mortgage. Buy a catheter, posters of William Devane. Move to Texas.GUILFOYLE: Can we move with William Devane?GUTFELD: He's busy. William Devane doesn't have time for us.GUILFOYLE: Amazing. Let me ask you something. If you're so worried about blocking Hillary Clinton, then you -- you're concerned that she's in the White House. Don't let her get elected. Then you don't have to worry about blocking her, people.WILLIAMS: Except there's a guy named Trump. ""One More Thing,"" up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Me, too. All right. Time for ""One More Thing."" I'll begin with myself. Then I won't forget to go.This is an important story. And you saw it a little bit on ""FOX and friends"" and on the channel throughout the day. And I think this is outrageous. And I'm sure you do, too.The California National Guard, what a betrayal to the men and women that serve. ""The L.A. Times"" reported thousands of California veterans, many who have served multiple combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, were asked to re-enlist due to deployment shortages. They rose to the occasion, and they were offered 15 grand in bonuses for enlisting. Guess what? Now they've been told, pay it back.And the problem is, the consequences are significant. They're being hit with interest charges, wage garnishment and tax liens if they refuse.Take a listen to Susan Haley, who has served this country in the U.S. Army as a master sergeant for 26 valiant years, deployed to Afghanistan in 2008 after receiving one of these bonuses.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MASTER SGT. SUSAN HALEY, U.S. ARMY: It's terrible. It's going to make -- we are going to go broke if this continues. We're already using up our savings to pay for it. And my husband is also taking a cut in pay at his job because of the military cutbacks. So it's really devastating.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Awful. So rise up and stand for the men and women that serve our country for our freedoms and our liberty, and complain to the California governor and also to my ex-husband, lieutenant governor, who Dana says should do something about this. And I'm dead serious.PERINO: He's going to run for governor.GUILFOYLE: He's running for governor.BOLLING: Didn't we just give Iran a billion seven?WILLIAMS: No, we didn't.BOLLING: Yes, we did. We gave them back billion seven.GUILFOYLE: Dana Perino, something exciting.PERINO: Yes, something a little bit different. So I've been telling you about this book, ""Let Me Tell You About Jasper."" It comes out tomorrow morning. And actually, tomorrow morning on ""FOX and Friends,"" I'm be there. That's the only place you're going to see that furry little guy. Jasper will be with me.But to my surprise, today Kathie Lee Gifford over at ""The Today Show"" did this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KATHIE LEE GIFFORD, CO-HOST, NBC'S ""THE TODAY SHOW"": Mine is a book by my friend Dana Perino called ""Let Me Tell You About Jasper."" It is adorable. She is just a very, very special woman. Very smart, very capable, but very real. Love her. And she adores this dog, like I adore Bambino and you adore Blake. If you're a dog lover or you're just into politics and just want some sense to be made of all of it, preorder it now.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Thank you, Kathie Lee, from all of us here. We all love you.GUILFOYLE: We do. And we love Hoda. They're the best.GUTFELD: She doesn't like you. Kathie Lee can't stand you. She tells me that all the time. Get rid of that crazy lady.GUILFOYLE: She likes me.GUTFELD: Anyway, I have an article at FOXNews.com/opinion. It's my review of ""Black Mirror,"" which is the Sci-Fi/fantasy British show which you should read, but it's also about our current state of life on planet earth.Meanwhile...GUILFOYLE: Oh, two.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: I hate these people!(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Once again, let us go to the gym. When I am finished working out and I'm waiting at the water fountain, and you just arrive with your giant empty gallon to fill up with water so you can get your soul cycle, get in the back of the line.GUILFOYLE: You did this already.GUTFELD: I'm doing it again, because they keep doing it.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God!GUTFELD: They keep doing it. They need to have a separate place where you fill up your...GUILFOYLE: You are so OCD.GUTFELD: I hate you.GUILFOYLE: Weird neuroses.GUTFELD: I'm not done yet, Eric!BOLLING: Oh, you're not?GUTFELD: No, I'm kidding.BOLLING: Two polls came out, both measuring the same thing with vastly different results. Check this out. I had to dig deep into this. So ABC tracking had Clinton up by 12. If you look in the internals of this poll, Republicans 27, Democrats 36, independents 31. That's these plus nine, look what happens.When you go to the IBD tracking poll, which is D=R, the same amount polled in both, you end up with Trump plus one.Here's America, though: Republicans 27, Democrats 32, independents 40. And that's according to Gallop. So if you apply that, neither one of these are tracking America exactly. But I would tell you, you get vastly different results. You've got to go internally and you've got to go deep.GUILFOYLE: Go ahead, Juan.WILLIAMS: Hey, look, it's pimp -- pump...PERINO: Whoa! What?WILLIAMS: ... pumpkin picking season. So Saturday, I got to go out to Butler's Orchard in Gaithersburg, Maryland, with two beautiful girls, my granddaughters, and my skeleton-face-painted grandson. So here are some pictures. There I am coming down the slide. We had a great time. Thanks to Butler's Orchard.GUILFOYLE: ""Special Report"" is next.GUTFELD: Kathie's mad at me.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
