This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" October 14, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: All right everybody, this is ""The Five,"" I'm Eric Bolling. Everyone is here, but Donald Trump is not backing down, he's pushing back vigorously at allegations of sexual assault as two new accusers come forward. One alleges he sexually groped her at a nightclub in the 1990s; the other is a former contestant on ""The Apprentice."" Summer Zervos held the news conference earlier alleging the republican nominee sexually accosted her when they met at a hotel in 2007 to discuss employment. Trump maintains all of the accusations are lies and he blames the Clinton friendly press for trying to derail his campaign. He targeted one man in particular today, a Mexican billionaire tied to both the Clintons and The New York Times.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The largest shareholder in the Times is Carlos Slim. Now Carlos Slim, as you know comes from Mexico. He has given many millions of dollars to the Clintons. Reporters at The New York Times -- they're not journalists. They're corporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim and for Hillary Clinton. Right now, I am being viciously attacked with lies and smears. Some are doing it for probably a little fame. They get some free fame. It's a total setup. Now suddenly after many, many years, phony accusers come out less than a month before one of the most important elections in the history of our country. Even a simple investigation would have shown these allegations against me in just about all cases. It's nonsense. It's false. The whole thing is one big fix. It's one big fix.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right. The whole family is here and ready to go but Greg, your thoughts on the new accusers coming out. They keep coming.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yeah. I mean -- I guess the thing -- Bloomberg reported that Trump wouldn't let his campaign staff vet him. So it's to prep -- to help his campaign prep for these things. That should tip you off if your candidate says, ""Oh, yeah, feel free to take a look around, don't go in the shed .(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: "". don't go in the shed."" But I, you know what? I think I feel -- maybe the viewers can agree with me. This is like the worst party ever. It's like when the house is trashed and the furniture is broken and the pets are missing .DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Who is coming over?GUTFELD: It's like; it's like the worst thing --KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: And number three.PERINO: The number, yeah.GUTFELD: And then 27 days, we're going to have the worst hangover. We're going to need political rehab.BOLLING: Oh, and you going to miss -- you are going to miss all this all.GUTFELD: Oh, no. But you, you know this giant carpet cleaning machines .PERINO: Yeah.GUTFELD: . you get from supermarkets? We need to run that over the country. It's I feel like --(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: I feel like we've all been covered with muck and dirt and mud.GUILFOYLE: Those work really well, by the way.GUTFELD: They do. Believe me.GUILFOYLE: Yes, yes.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: It's many a frat house has rented those.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Now OK, Miss Dana.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: You know, with so much going on -- first of all, do we wait -- listen, I understand that if you don't want to ever say that an accuser isn't being honest, but do we wait to get a little bit more from evidence or -- what does he do? What is Donald Trump doing?PERINO: I don't know what he is doing. To me -- also, I just have to say, one of the reasons that we are kind of laughing is that Kimberly was stuck in the elevator until five?GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: 59 and 29 seconds .GUILFOYLE: 4:59, yeah.PERINO: . and she still made it here which is amazing things weird.GUILFOYLE: I was trapped which normally I enjoy, because firemen come and rescue me. This -- yeah and I was like locked -- then anyway, I was screaming, ""Help me (inaudible). Somebody come save me."" It was in the freight elevator. I mean you can't make it up. Unbelievable. But anyway --GUTFELD: What were you doing in the freight elevator?PERINO: No, why they you put on that?BOLLING: But no. It's the easiest way from 12 to 1.GUTFELD: Really?GUILFOYLE: It's supposed to be the fastest .BOLLING: Yeah, that you don't have to walk around, there's no --GUILFOYLE: . and everyone makes fun of me because I always -- I'm paranoid. I'm going to get trap in here, whatever .BOLLING: Express.GUILFOYLE: . they press the wrong thing and they swipe the security and I was there like trapped cargo and --GUTFELD: Oh, I'm a freight it was a bad idea.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Yeah, exactly.GUTFELD: We'll be right back.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: And I will be able to answer your question, I just had to say that.GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: So last weekend, I think it was Hugh Hewitt, Ben Carson and a couple of others, after the audiotape came out from ""Access Hollywood,"" they, they said, ""We anticipate that more and worse things are going to come out."" And so apparently, this is it. You know the thing is that Trump has been accused by several women of sexual assault. He also is on the audiotape bragging to Billy Bush about sexual assault because he is powerful. And then he said, ""Oh, well, that's just locker room talk."" So -- then today, he was saying that there's no way that he would have sexually assaulted those people because they're not pretty enough. And I'm like, OK, what in the actual you know what is going on?GUTFELD: Watch your (inaudible).(CROSSTALK)PERINO: The other thing I thought was amazing today is you have this report out of ""The Apprentice"" where, apparently, he used to say that Marlee Matlin, who is deaf, she was on ""Celebrity Apprentice"". He used to say that she was retarded all the time. So she has responded and she was saying, ""How offensive it is."" And so I think when the things that the Trump campaign has done, instead of focus on the real issues, like they say they want everybody else to do. Now this story is completely into the mainstream pop culture world. And it doesn't matter what is covered on the actual news, because the most important thing the way people get their news now is on their phone. So from a pop culture standpoint, that's where that is all happening. I would just add this is all, at the same time Trump has pulled his staff out of Virginia. Arizona shows a tie with her -- one poll has her up by one. And in Florida, a really tally number; 503,000 new democrats are registered in 2016 compared to the republicans at 60,000. So we have to be really clear eyed about what is this -- what is happening. And so come blaming ""The New York Times"" and Carlos Slim, and all of these things is a distraction that is not helping him to get to Wednesday night at that debate where he can make a convincing closing argument.GUTFELD: Isn't Carlos Slim actually Anthony Weiner?BOLLING: No, it's danger.GUILFOYLE: Danger.BOLLING: Danger, probably.GUILFOYLE: Carlos Danger.BOLLING: Both Carlo, both Carlo's.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: I would just -- I would throw in -- look, again, never are these things OK.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: We know a lot of them. We are hearing a lot of them. Over time, they will all be litigated. We'll find out which one are true, which ones are not and maybe they are all true. Who knows? But at the same time you have Iran that's moving warships towards our .PERINO: Yup.BOLLING: . aircraft, aircraft carriers .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: . and in the Gulf. We have ISIS who promised to use exploding drones.PERINO: And they did it.BOLLING: You have a Syrian civil war that has now drowned in three world super powers with nuclear weapons; the Great Britain, America and the Russians. Who knows how that's going to blow up?GUILFOYLE: And a huge amount of stereotype.BOLLING: And in the meantime, Hillary Clinton has got all these e-mails. If I were the Trump campaign -- and I would just, literally just pivot and stay on .PERINO: You know what I think he should do?BOLLING: . issues.PERINO: He should take so -- the WikiLeaks things. All those, all the e- mails that he think are his top favorites, and he could just do a dramatic interpretation and just read them. He was up there for three hours so they've given a speech. So I was just -- if you want people to focus on WikiLeaks, then you got to talk about it.GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: You can't just talk about all of your accusers and then destroy -- and then insult them.GUILFOYLE: So you're saying less defending and just more go on the attack in terms of Hillary Clinton? But I'm gonna -- he has already done the disclaimer, I denial this, (inaudible) --PERINO: Bu the other thing he said about Hillary Clinton today is when she walked in front of him at the debate, he wasn't impressed. I mean, that's not impressive.GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: All right?(CROSSTALK)PERINO: And the republican men that are defending this are really irritating me; (inaudible) Mt. Vesuvius all day.GUTFELD: You have.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my goodness.BOLLING: Are we good?GUTFELD: What?BOLLING: Are we good at --PERINO: No, I don't venting -- and another thing .BOLLING: Are we -- you and I --GUILFOYLE: It's like a powerful of a volcano.BOLLING: As long as we're good.PERINO: Yeah, we're good.BOLLING: OK, all right.GUILFOYLE: OK, Vesuvius.BOLLING: And clear that up.GUILFOYLE: We'll let you take a moment.PERINO: You are not after doing it. There are people like, you know who you are.GUILFOYLE: One might -- and she's going to come -- get you, and we are going to lock you in the freight elevator .BOLLING: There is --GUILFOYLE: . and you'll be screaming for your life.BOLLING: There is should be a thing.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: You know what? That Dana is -- most of the .PERINO: The look?BOLLING: The look. Was it the look?GUILFOYLE: Oh, yes.WILLIAMS: Yeah --GUILFOYLE: She had put you on this.PERINO: You know who you are Ben Carson, love that look (ph).GUILFOYLE: Oh my, goodness.WILLIAMS: Yeah, you know what Ben --PERINO: And others. Senator Sessions.WILLIAMS: Yeah, you know what Ben will say to you --PERINO: What?GUTFELD: Cut the mic.PERINO: I'll cut my mic.WILLIAMS: Cut the mic. Cut the mic --PERINO: Yeah, because women should be seen and not heard -- apparently.WILLIAMS: Well --GUTFELD: Finally, you agree with me Dana.PERINO: After 20 years of defending these guys.WILLIAMS: Well, you know, I'm --PERINO: It's done.WILLIAMS: I'm enjoying this conversation.GUILFOYLE: Well, we're dominating --WILLIAMS: I'm just --GUILFOYLE: We're dominating ""The Five"" today. I tell you that much.WILLIAMS: I hope you in the audience are enjoying this conversation, but I must say, I don't think --GUILFOYLE: Do you agree with Dana's strategy, by the way?WILLIAMS: What's his strategy?GUILFOYLE: Well his strategy is turn, pivot, talk about Hillary Clinton; talk about the e-mails, read it .WILLIAMS: He's not doing that.GUILFOYLE: . and not --WILLIAMS: He's not doing that. And I don't know .(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: . how effective it would be .GUILFOYLE: The accusers.WILLIAMS: . because it's the moment what Dana also said is, America is focused on sex talk.GUILFOYLE: Uh-huh.WILLIAMS: And sexual misbehavior. And it's hard -- even among us, if you -- if we start talking about sex this day -- oh, yeah, you know we should talk about Iranian threats in the Middle East .GUILFOYLE: What?WILLIAMS: . and say, oh, oh. What did you say about that sex stuff? That's just human nature. So, but the thing that it fascinates me in terms of the politics of the response, Kimberly .GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: . is that he is going after Paul Ryan. He is going after Paul Ryan much more than Hillary Clinton. He is going after the ladies that he says are falsely charging him, going after Carlos Slim, but he is also going after republicans. So he is at war with the party, and it's incredible. I mean, to me, I don't understand if accept as performance art. And it is excellent, excellent performance art. Everybody is captivated by Donald Trump.BOLLING: But he is doing also is he's -- I know (inaudible) and I knew you're going to say there's not enough voters in the base, but do we know that for sure? We know there haven't been enough voters in the base for the past .WILLIAMS: Well, I know, I know you don't .BOLLING: But you --WILLIAMS: . love polls .BOLLING: No, but you saying -- bringing out .WILLIAMS: But I must say the polls are pretty good.BOLLING: . you are bringing out more and more voters than ever before and you .WILLIAMS: Fine.BOLLING: . you can't apply the same .WILLIAMS: They might --BOLLING: . numbers from prior elections these days. Let me just speak --WILLIAMS: I'm just saying --BOLLING: Allow me to finish.WILLIAMS: No, no, no. Let me make .BOLLING: Even under .WILLIAMS: . correct this point here.BOLLING: Even under this -- the polls .WILLIAMS: Allow me to speak for a moment.BOLLING: . you still have .GUILFOYLE: One at a time.BOLLING: . statistical ties in almost everyone in the battlegrounds.WILLIAMS: No, you don't. No you do not.BOLLING: Sure you do.WILLIAMS: No.BOLLING: Within the margin of error of .WILLIAMS: No.BOLLING: . of all of this. Yes, you do Juan. You do.WILLIAMS: I'm saying, it means right now, the, the key and what swung the swing states, Eric, and what is swinging the national numbers way beyond margin of error is the idea that Trump is now down among women. He used to be down about 12.BOLLING: Right. He did.WILLIAMS: Now he is down about 21.BOLLING: Yeah.WILLIAMS: And you know what? It used to be that the educated republican women. Kimberly Guilfoyle, Dana Perino were like, we're not sure about this Donald Trump guy. Now working class republican women are even with Trump and Hillary Clinton.BOLLING: But let's go back to --GUTFELD: Can I add?BOLLING: But let's go back to swing states, though.WILLIAMS: And that's killing him.BOLLING: Should swing states have everyone.WILLIAMS: No, it's not.BOLLING: North Carolina, Ohio, Florida --WILLIAMS: Eric, keep going .BOLLING: All of this.WILLIAMS: . because you are living in a delusion.BOLLING: And Colorado. All of them are within the margin of error.GUTFELD: All right.BOLLING: Yeah.WILLIAMS: No, no, no.GUILFOYLE: Go ahead, Greg.GUTFELD: Can I bring up a study that just came out at American Psychological Association says that 52 percent of adults say this election has been somewhat, a somewhat significant source of stress.WILLIAMS: Yes.GUTFELD: This election is tearing people apart.GUILFOYLE: You think so?GUTFELD: So you know what my solution is Kimberly .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: . you know what it is. Begins with an R and ends with an S. Robots. We have to start thinking about our political leaders becoming automated. They have no past. If they have a past, you can erase it. You can't hack the robots. They don't have -- they don't send e-mails. They don't have affairs. They don't assault women.WILLIAMS: Yes.GUTFELD: I welcome a robot overlord's -- death to humans.GUILFOYLE: I'm --BOLLING: Yes.GUILFOYLE: I wouldn't put it past a robot just yet. Let me try that.GUTFELD: Well, robot, robot with you -- I could see being tempted.GUILFOYLE: It's happened.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Straight ahead -- I love (inaudible). I love when Juan gives me a look.PERINO: Wow.GUILFOYLE: I know --PERINO: So now we can't talk about Iranian missiles anymore.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Another big WikiLeaks e-mail drop today, this one revealing panic within the Clinton camp over how to deal with the nominee's private server controversy; all the details, next. And later, your favorite, Facebook Friday, the final debate edition. What questions would you like answered at the last Clinton-Trump showdown. Post them now on facebook.com/thefivefnc and we will be back -- I think so -- in a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Today, WikiLeaks released the 7th batch of e-mails from the hacked account of Hillary Clinton chair, John Podesta. One message appears to the president, deeper into the private server controversy. There is a lot to dissect. So, who better to bring in, but Election Ed Henry, who comes through them this morning? Ed, I have to say one of my favorite with ones that I just saw was apparently in one of these meetings, Hillary Clinton said that the environmental groups, they were meeting with environmental groups and union that she turns the environment and she says, ""Get a life."" (inaudible), you know --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Willingness to push back.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: But there's also a lot of concern and the flip-flopping. What have you found?ED HENRY, CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. Well, I think on the e-mail question you mentioned that President Obama being drawn in here was interesting is there's an e-mail from John Podesta to Cheryl Mills from March of 2015 that basically says she would hold box of e-mails that were going back and forth between President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Why is that significant? Well, March 2015 is when the whole story, you know, was burst open. ""The New York Times"" saying there was a private server. Trey Gowdy on Hill issuing a subpoena saying preserve all these records. Hillary Clinton going out there and having that news conference saying all work- related e-mails were turned over. And then at the end of that month, what happened, well the IT folks in Colorado deleted thousands of e-mails with BleachBit. So this doesn't prove anything, but it raises perhaps more questions about the timeline there in terms of, you know, what kind of e- mails were going back and forth between President Obama and Hillary Clinton that John Podesta and Cheryl Mills didn't want the public to see.PERINO: And this is the, this is the same story that they thought it would be over by the end of that weekend according to .HENRY: We see that on the (inaudible).PERINO: . WikiLeaks. All right, we'll go around the table. Eric is next.BOLLING: Hey, Election Ed. Disturbing e-mails, especially for me is the one, one between John Podesta, Jennifer Palmieri, the Clintons spokesperson, and John Halpin who work at the Center for American Progress, Podesta founded organization. Halpin says, ""It's an amazing, it's an amazing bastardization of the faith, they must be attracted to the systemic thought and severely backwards gender relations and must be totally unaware of Christian democracy when talking about Catholics."" And here's the part.HENRY: Yeah.BOLLING: Palmieri responds to that and says, ""I imagine that you think it's most socially acceptable, politically conservative religion, their rich friends wouldn't understand if they become, if they became evangelicals. So here's my question.HENRY: Yeah.BOLLING: Does Hillary Clinton understand that she -- not only offended 80 million or 75 million Catholics but also, probably, everyone of faith in the country or does she just not care that she did that?HENRY: Well, I think based on her convention speech in Philadelphia -- and you framed that quite interesting, I will point out.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: She's like --GUTFELD: I don't think she said it, though.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: All right, yeah. I don't think she wrote it.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: And she hasn't pushed back on it --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: It was a private e-mail of somebody else.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Come on.HENRY: Sorry, Greg. You will get your turn. Greg, you will get your turn.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Oh, my God.HENRY: You know what, wait your turn Greg. Wait your turn.(LAUGHTER)HENRY: Seriously.GUTFELD: I can't help it.HENRY: The bottom line is that in Philadelphia, Hillary Clinton spoke very openly about her faith and her method is faith shaping -- of faith shaping her. And so when this stuff comes out -- you are right, it's highly embarrassing to her and to the campaign. It is pretty remarkable that they haven't apologized about it at all. And I think here is the bigger picture. Is this is a campaign, the Clinton campaign, which is winning right now, on the notion that Donald Trump is dividing the country. Hillary Clinton, her campaign theme is stronger together. Let's bring folks together. We are the world. Let's hug. All of that. And then when you look at the e-mails, they are beating up on Catholics. There's another e-mail going after Latinos. There's an e-mail today going after the former NAACP chief Ben Jealous. So it seems in private they are saying something much different than what they say in public.PERINO: All right. Juan Williams?GUTFELD: Oh, my God. What a surprise. People in their own personal e-mails are actually saying something private --HENRY: Yeah.GUTFELD: God Forbid.HENRY: Shocking.GUTFELD: Unreal.HENRY: Yes.PERINO: We'll go to -- we'll go at Juan next, for a question.WILLIAMS: I just want to reiterate something that Greg said.HENRY: Not your turn Greg. It's not your turn.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: Greg said, ""She didn't write that.""BOLLING: No, but she didn't push back on it.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Her spokesperson said it .WILLIAMS: Yes.BOLLING: . and she has not addressed it.WILLIAMS: You keep hammering this --BOLLING: That's the problem, Juan.WILLIAMS: You keep hammering this like you are swinging in .BOLLING: Here's the deal Juan.WILLIAMS: . 10 weeks ago.BOLLING: There are 70 million Catholics .WILLIAMS: All right.BOLLING: . right now who are offended by it.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Oh my, gosh.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Sixty -nine million .WILLIAMS: I don't know.BOLLING: . ninety-nine thousand --HENRY: Please --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Now, OK.HENRY: You need to talk to (inaudible).(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: All right, Ed Henry. Listen, I have a real -- I have two things I want to ask you about. One is --GUILFOYLE: What is happening to the show?WILLIAMS: So in this WikiLeaks there comes out '08 when Clinton is running against Obama, opposition research it looks like to me, suggesting, oh, gosh, what about his middle name, Hussein?HENRY: Yeah.WILLIAMS: What about the idea that their land deals, that might bring in the question. He doesn't put his hand over his heart. He doesn't wear a flag pin.HENRY: Yeah.WILLIAMS: What do you make of that Ed?HENRY: Never heard of that before. Well, I mean look.WILLIAMS: OK.HENRY: This is a playbook that democrats were talking about, and they have accused of republicans of attacking President Obama with now for what, eight, eight years or more. And they have attacked him, which you point out republicans have done some of that. And Donald Trump has been (inaudible) by the Clinton camp for birtherism and all of that in this campaign. But remember in that first debate at Hofstra where Donald Trump was pushing back and saying, ""No, no. Wait a second. It was your campaign that started this."" Now, I'm not going to litigate that. Let them fight it out. But I think the e-mail you are pointing to talks about Clinton people back in '08, it's in John Podesta's private e-mail account because he was involved back then as well, it's not about this campaign, per se. But yes, you are right, you know, wait a second. The Clinton folks were talking about it too; maybe Donald Trump had a point in the first debate.WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think he was talking about, they -- I never saw that they were talking about the birther --PERINO: We are going to run out of time, guys -- yeah.HENRY: Well, he's Muslim -- whether he was Muslim or a Christian .WILLIAMS: Yeah.HENRY: . I'm just saying it's of the same pizza.PERINO: We're going to run out of time, so we got at KG next.GUILFOYLE: OK.GUTFELD: What about me?GUILFOYLE: You have been interrupting enough.PERINO: Yeah, after that.HENRY: No.GUILFOYLE: All right. Hi, Ed.HENRY: Hi.GUILFOYLE: So I just want to ask you, there has been a lot of discussion now about reopening an investigation, getting a special prosecutor, convening a grand jury because of some of the revelations coming forward in this WikiLeaks transmission are quite disturbing as it relates to the kind of a collusion, et cetera with the Justice Department .HENRY: Well, yes.GUILFOYLE: . with the administration and Hillary's campaign.HENRY: Well, Mike Pence was on ""Fox and Friends"" and you know he certainly would like to see that happen and I think what's -- but it's unlikely. Obviously, this close to the election, you know better than I, with your legal background and political background, because this is politics clashing with illegal. And that's the frustration the Trump-Pence campaign which is that they think politics hijacked the facts with these e-mails feeling out suggesting there was collusion and there may have been more problems with the e-mails. But frankly, the Trump-Pence -- taking us talking about it and it looks, at least right now, like people are not hearing them.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Ed, I got a statement and a question. The people who are defending WikiLeaks keep saying that if you have nothing to hide, then you shouldn't fear hacking. I say that if you have nothing to hide, you are boring, and you are not a human being, and I don't want to know you.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: If you don't have anything interesting in your past, you are a loser.GUILFOYLE: Robot.HENRY: Right.GUTFELD: Every person has a private .GUILFOYLE: Robot.GUTFELD: . dark world and they have a right to keep that world private and dark. Now to my question --GUILFOYLE: So that's just your basement.GUTFELD: Yeah, exactly.BOLLING: Ken Bone. Wow.GUTFELD: Ken Bone, exactly.BOLLING: Wow.GUTFELD: Perfect example.BOLLING: Yeah.GUTFELD: Exactly. That's the -- you got it.HENRY: Great example.GUTFELD: All right. Ed, do you have any idea how -- where WikiLeaks get, gets this from?(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Like what -- is it Russia? Is it Guccifer? Does anybody care but me?WILLIAMS: How about Roger Stone?(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: There are -- well, there are House democrats who in this -- in the past hour who have come out and said they want to launch their own investigation. Kimberly asked about investigating the Clinton side. There are House democrats now saying here in Washington, ""Let's investigate Roger Stone's ties to the Russians. Why was he tweeting a few months ago about how John Podesta and others might be targeted by these hacks? And so, look, that may just be spin from the Clinton camp, but they do have some evidence suggesting that there may have been collusion on that side of this. So, I think the bottom line, though, Greg, when you talk about whether or not you are a loser, when you said if there's nothing interesting in your background -- sounds like there's nothing interesting in your background.GUTFELD: Oh.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Oh.GUILFOYLE: Oh .GUTFELD: I wouldn't go there Ed.GUILFOYLE: You would be surprised.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: I think the (inaudible)--GUILFOYLE: You would be surprised.PERINO: All right. Thanks, Ed.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: Those watching our networks aren't hearing much on these e-mail findings. The breakdown of mainstream media's WikiLeaks coverage -- we'll have that next.GUILFOYLE: OK.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: Donald Trump blames the media for focusing too much on him -- get that, and not enough on his opponent. Kimberley Strassel, ""The Wall Street Journal"" agrees. In a new column, Strassel argues that the president is ignoring bombshell from the WikiLeaks dumps and burying Hillary Clinton's, quote, ""Sins."" Kimberley Strassel writes, quote, ""Mrs. Clinton has been exposed to have no core, to be someone who constantly changes her position to maximize political gain. Voters might not know any of this, because while both presidential candidates have plenty to answer for, the press has focused solely on taking out Mr. Trump,"" end quote. According to our research, that's pretty much on target. The three evening news shows on the broadcast networks either spent 30 seconds or less last night on the WikiLeaks revelations or they didn't cover it at all. That was pretty much the same for the morning news shows today. They spent a minute or less on the e-mails except for when Trump's running mate, Mike Pence brought them up. Kimberly, Mike Pence was struggling back and forth and trying to pivot, but the anchors would say, but we, we have you here, Mr. Pence, and so we want to talk about your running mate and his problems. Was that fair?GUILFOYLE: No. It wasn't fair. Why -- he should be able to talk about the e-mails and the WikiLeaks revelations as well, because it's important, it's significant and t goes to the character and quality and her fitness to be president of the United States, so you should be devoting time to it. And you saw that he was on ""Fox and Friends"" and they were able to talk about that here because there wasn't just an agenda to just provide one side of the news cycle story as it relates to the presidential election. You know, I think Pence is right to fight for topic discussion that he feels is relevant for the voters to be able to make an informed decision come November 8th.WILLIAMS: Eric, one of the points of comparison is ""The New York Times"" published a story about Donald Trump's taxes that was a leak, right? And then you have WikiLeaks now, and this is a leak. And people are saying, well, if ""The New York Times"" published that, why aren't they paying attention to this? The answer from David Barstow of ""The New York Times"" says, ""I only publish stuff where I can confirm that it's accurate and that it's real."" And that -- I guess the point is, we don't know about the WikiLeaks stuff.BOLLING: Fair enough. That I -- fair enough and but when, when you do know then go ahead and publish -- I guess. I don't know. Again, the privacy issues, I have a problem with this as well, but in -- look at how these shows have, have treated. Mind you, the numbers we put up for the -- the evening newscast.FEMALE: Right.BOLLING: .they're like 30-minute newscast and about 10 minutes of that is commercial. So 20 minutes, ABC had nine minutes of 20 (ph) on Trump -- not 30 seconds on Wikileaks -- nine minutes on NBC, five minutes for Trump, 26 seconds, no mentions on NBC.But the one that really gets me is in the morning shows where George Stephanopoulos basically runs that ABC morning show.PERINO (?): Oh, my gosh, they go in a circle (ph).BOLLING: Zero minutes on the Wikileaks -- zero minutes. At least CBS this morning had one minute on it. And ""The Today Show"" had 30 seconds on it.They're -- they have hours upon hours to cover this stuff. That's -- that's appalling. And I just wonder if it was Stephanopoulos saying, hey, I used to work for these people.Maybe I'll just look that way.GUTFELD: Dana?PERINO: Well, I'm not exactly sure how people make decisions on what gets covered and what's not. But I imagine that what they want is ratings.So Donald Trump got a ton of free media at the beginning during the primary season from all sorts of media. And it was working in his favor because the networks got ratings.Now, they're talking about Donald Trump because it helps them get their ratings. And the Wikileaks saying obviously, it's pbr not rating as well.But you can see more about this tomorrow because ""The Wall Street Journal"" editorial report, which runs on Saturdays at 3:00 p.m. on Fox News Channel, it's an hour-long program. I love it.Kim Straussel (ph) is always on. She'll -- she'll be able to, in depth, cover a little bit more if you're interested.The story I think that's gotten very buried in all of this Trump talk is the one that there is discontent at the FBI at high levels, upset about how the e-mails was handled and -- and then Comey saying that there should be no indictment. That's the story I think that's been way buried and.GUILFOYLE (?): That's the big one (ph).PERINO: .also -- could also have to do with ratings. But Donald Trump's not helping himself by continuing to keep (ph) the fire.WILLIAMS: So Greg, is this -- is this liberal media bias writ large?GUTFELD: Well, you know what, when you look at the -- the tiny ratio of - - of -- of coverage devoted to Wikileaks, Wikileaks now knows what it feels like to be Marco Rubio or Rick Perry or Jeb Bush because during the primary, that's exactly what the ratio was. So clearly, to your point, the media wants Hillary to win.There's no doubt about that, even after devoting billions of dollars of free media to Trump. So do you feel that you were set up because you were.GUILFOYLE: You were.GUTFELD: You were set up. The media.PERINO: We know that with Wikileaks.GUTFELD: .including Hillary -- Wikileaks -- I know, the only thing that I'm happy about. Hillary and Obama, they knew elevating Donald Trump.PERINO (?): Yes.GUTFELD: .giving him an air of respectability in the press as well, turned him into the Republican nominee, then out came the knives (ph) -- out came the knives (ph).GUILFOYLE: Only so they could stand by and because they knew that they could take -- crush his chances of the presidency.GUTFELD: Yes.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: .and the agents -- the news organizations that held information to only dump it for maximum throttle impact.GUTFELD: Not their fault. Therefore (ph), we saw it coming and we were suckers.WILLIAMS: Well, you know.GUILFOYLE: Well, we didn't have it.GUTFELD (?): What do you mean?GUILFOYLE: We didn't have the tape.GUTFELD: Oh, I'm just talking about common sense.BOLLING: You know, I think (ph) -- you know what -- the media would be sitting (ph) Marco Rubio or Jeb Bush or.PERINO (?): Yes, they would.BOLLING: .or -- or.GUTFELD: Yes, absolutely, yes, yes, yes.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: But one of the things.GUILFOYLE (?): Look what they did to Romney.WILLIAMS: .we did learn from Wikileaks is, in fact, that the Clinton campaign was far more concerned about Marco Rubio, Kasich and others than Donald Trump. They preferred Donald Trump as the opposition.Stay right there.GUTFELD (?): Do we all.WILLIAMS: .because the fastest seven, Dr. Eric Bowen up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: The fastest afternoon show (ph) on television, three bold (ph) stories, seven brisk minutes, one breath (ph). So first up (ph), one of Trump's major complaints is that the media is in the tank for Hillary.We just highlighted mainstream media news organizations' unfair treatment but not wanting to be left behind, television dramas boarded the Hillary bus. Check out ""Law and Order SVU's"" upcoming episode, which will feature a Trump-inspired character.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(UNIDENTIFIED MALE): The next ""SVU."" ""I'm a handsome, charming millionaire. Women throw themselves at me.""Gary Cole in an unforgettable performance, ""Know that I have nothing to hide.""New ""SVU,"" Wednesday on NBC.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Now, that (ph) episode with the obvious political bias, set to air October 26, just days before the election.GUILFOYLE: Just days before -- we've seen this happen before, have we not? But I mean, it's not very surprising, given sort of the liberal bent of Hollywood media and what they like to do with their movies and their T.V. shows.So I mean, do I think it's going to have a huge impact, big league? I mean, probably not.BOLLING (?): Doesn't help, though. The narrative continues, right, helps promote.WILLIAMS: Oh, I think the narrative -- believe me, the narrative that's going on without them.BOLLING (?): But they do, for example, I know I'm on the board of a group, a juvenile law group in Philadelphia. And you know, they found judges who were corrupt and sending kids to jail in order to get money in exchange.And they did a story about that. So they -- they pick up on things in the news. And I think they're just taking advantage of what's there right now.GUTFELD (?): Ratings.PERINO (?): Yes, definitely ratings. Remember also, when we watched ""Homeland"" and how we were impressed because they're in the middle of the season and they were actually able to adapt and talk about things that were happening in real time in the world, that I thought that was impressive.But this goes back to what I said in A block (ph). This is now in the pop culture world.BOLLING (?): Yes.PERINO: And culture -- politics flows after culture, right? It's like culture and politics and so.GUTFELD (?): Yes, downstream from -- yes.PERINO: Not good.BOLLING (?): And also keeps the narrative alive.GUTFELD: Well, it's that (ph) -- ""Law and Order,"" the philosophy is torn from the newspaper pages. But they do the stories terribly. They're always poorly written.They -- they take great actors, like Gary Cole is a fantastic actor. And they make them act bad. It's very origami (ph).(CROSSTALK)PERINO (?): Yes, true.GUTFELD: .very plastic, very stiff. But it -- but it -- but it fits.PERINO (?): But how does it go (ph)?GUTFELD: .well, that's because you watch it when you're home sick and -- or unemployed and you're just sitting there, you just watch episode -- I've been there.I watched 17 in a row.PERINO: You know who watches -- you know what their demographic is (ph) is huge for women.WILLIAMS: Well, I was about to say, and insulting my wife but I won't talk (ph).(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: I was talking to myself (ph). But the other big two (ph), in ""Law and Order,"" almost all criminals are rich, like white, upper class -- upper east side, socialites, architects.BOLLING (?): Republican.GUTFELD: Republican. There's no street crime at all in ""Law and Order (ph).""(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Gee, wait a second, my (ph) people have no complaint here.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: .going to scroll the prompter to offend one quarter of the electoral (ph), calling them deplorables. She's offended 70 million Catholics.She's offended, quote, ""needy Latinos."" Now, she may have offended millennials by suggesting that millenials prefer to watch cat videos over the news.PERINO (?): They do.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: It makes you want to turn off the news. It makes you want to unplug the Internet or just look at cat gifs.(LAUGHTER)Believe me, I get it. In the last few weeks, I've watched a lot of cats do a lot of weird and interesting things.(LAUGHTER)But we have a job to do. And it'll be good for people and for cats.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right, Greg.GUILFOYLE: All right, Greg.BOLLING: Cat expert.GUTFELD: I don't even know where this story came from. But I didn't even get that from there. I -- I -- OK, if that's condescending, then every one of my one more things is condescending because I end each show on purpose with an animal video to cleanse the pallet (ph) because if you've heard about bad news.GUILFOYLE (?): Don't remind of the hyena.GUTFELD: .you have enough bad news. I bring you a dirty hyena. So that's -- that's the point. Everybody loves cat videos.Everybody likes -- that's what -- how YouTube is made. It's off that stuff.BOLLING (?): Yes. Did you get that, Porter (ph)? Did you hear that? You got that?(LAUGHTER)PERINO: She might have seen this in ""The Wall Street Journal"" because you remember last week, I pitched the story to lighten things up around here, that it was a front-page personal journal -- I have sort of active (ph) memories so I remember it. And it said, the headline was ""Watching Cat Videos Can be Good for You.GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: And there was this whole psychological study that.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: I read it.PERINO: .some (ph) mostly had done that said it actually makes you feel better. They like.BOLLING (?): It does.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Reduces.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Look at that, I love.GUILFOYLE: Releases some endorphins.PERINO(?): Oh, my gosh, hi, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty cat, kitty cat.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING (?): Also -- ten the other side (ph).PERINO (?): Except if you're ISIS and you own a cat, they said then it's punishable by death.GUILFOYLE (?): Right.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: But the other side of what she said is also true. And I think we've said this here, which is this is tawdry (ph) campaign.It just doesn't feel good.GUTFELD: You're going after the cats now.WILLIAMS: No, no -- yes, let the cats come in because most of us are feeling like, wow, when is this thing over?GUILFOYLE (?): Twenty-five days.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING (?): Twenty-five days, exactly and three and a half hours -- 25 days, three and a half hours. Go ahead.GUILFOYLE: Kitty cat.BOLLING (?): That's it?GUILFOYLE: Yes.BOLLING: OK. We've got to do this very fast. Hillary Clinton appeared on the ""Ellen Degeneres Show.""She made some news about feeling like Trump hovered near her during the last debate. Then this happened.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DEGENERES: For some reason, no one is talking about this moment. But we have to -- we have to show it.CLINTON: There's a lot at stake. This is not an ordinary time and this is not an ordinary election.We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just for eight years but to make (ph) some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world and the Supreme Court, in energy (ph), and so much else.CLINTON: All right, that was the best dancing I've ever done.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO (?): Yes, yes, it was.BOLLING: That was like the (ph) favorite video probably of the year so far.So Juan, your thoughts?WILLIAMS: Well, I think that's where we're going with politics right now. I don't (ph) think you can go much lower in this campaign.But at least, it will continue in the pop culture, dance, ridiculous moves.BOLLING (?): All right, quicker rounds (ph).GUILFOYLE: Yes, I loved it. I thought the dancing was excellent. And she should have done it during the debate.WILLIAMS (?): It's very funny (ph).GUTFELD: It just -- it shows you, again, technology as it becomes more and more amazing, you can frame anybody.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: Dana?(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Look at Ken Bozeman (ph).PERINO: I might even be able to look like a good dancer with that.BOLLING (?): There you go. There you go. Let's leave it right there.GUTFELD (?): Wow, wow.GUILFOYLE: Shut up, Greg.BOLLING: All right, next, we'll answer your questions on the upcoming final showdown between Trump v. Clinton. Facebook Friday is ahead coming up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: Yes, Facebook Friday, that is an infinite (ph). So there are some questions here from viewers. And there are going to be questions that you would answer if you were running for president.PERINO: OK.GUTFELD: So -- yes.PERINO: I'm pretending I'm running for president -- not as a character, but as.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: You could be Trump or -- what -- how you think they would answer -- how you -- you think they should answer. This is from Michelle M (ph).Our family has recently opened a small business. What advice would you give us for success as we pursue the American dream?PERINO: Oh, my goodness. That is a great question. One, I admire the tenacity and the willingness to take a risk to own a small business. That's not easy.I do think it's really important to get to know who your congressman is and your senator.GUTFELD: True.PERINO: They will -- it's important that they know who you are, that they hear your story. If they don't hear from you, somebody else is filling up their time. So I would suggest that.GUTFELD: That's a good point.Eric, you're a businessman.BOLLING: Yes, so if I'm running for president or if I'm Trump.GUTFELD: Or advising --or -- what would you tell them?BOLLING: .OK, so if I'm running as Hillary, I'd say, if you're opening a small business, you want to be successful, I would say move to another country because the small businesses are being choked in this country right now from taxes to Obamacare to regulation. And I will tell you, the -- the big one -- and you read ""The Wall Street Journal,"" the op-ed everyday.(CROSSTALK)PERINO (?): Always.BOLLING: Eric Metaxas yesterday talked about the estate tax, the debt (ph) tax, that is.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE (?): How punitive.BOLLING: .killing -- killing small businesses in America.GUILFOYLE (?): Yes.BOLLING: .because of farmers and small businesses who are asset-rich and cash-poor.PERINO (?): Yes.BOLLING: .and they can't turn over the farm or the business to their -- their heirs because there's not enough money in the coffers (ph).GUILFOYLE: That is a huge, huge problem. It really is, killing families (ph).GUTFELD: Yes, do you want this question or you want me to move to the next one?GUILFOYLE: Oh, I think we did a pretty good job and everyone (ph).GUTFELD: Yes, OK so good (ph) with you, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Yes, we're short on time, right?GUTFELD: .from Jason L (ph). What is your vision of the future of America? Very, very specific question there.GUILFOYLE: Like a Miss Universe question.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Imperialism and world domination.PERINO: Nice.BOLLING: Very close to Trump.GUILFOYLE: Not kidding.PERINO: And she did it under time.GUILFOYLE: Yes. No, but American exceptionalism, America back on top, taking the driver seat in terms of national security, foreign policy and being a leader in the world, not somebody who makes fake red lines, turns them pink, blurs them and doesn't do anything about it. We're -- we're not letting -- letting our country be dictated by Russia or China or North Korea or Iran.GUTFELD (?): Wow.WILLIAMS: Why (ph) -- why are you so anti-Trump today? I thought he -- he likes Russia. He likes Putin.He wants to take direction from them. I would say.GUILFOYLE: I'm pro-KG.GUTFELD: KGB.WILLIAMS: .on the first one, I -- I.GUILFOYLE: You know, that's one of my nicknames.WILLIAMS: .I just want to -- I just want to respond to Eric and say, you know what, people come to this country because it is such a wonderful country and has so much economic opportunity. Nobody's leaving. Nobody.In fact, big business and investment.BOLLING: Really, really?WILLIAMS: .is coming into the United States of America.BOLLING: I -- I -- I think that's an absolute (ph) false statement (ph).WILLIAMS: If you think people are leaving, go -- I don't see it. I don't see -- I've never seen Americans say, oh, yes, yeah, you know, America is a terrible place to do business.To the contrary, people say it's best place in the world.BOLLING: Well, we have the strongest buyer -- we have a strong buyer base.WILLIAMS: Oh, gosh.BOLLING: But as far as doing business.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: .small businesses are being shown to want.GUILFOYLE: Exporting -- exporting America.WILLIAMS: No, they are not. And you know what I would say, it's tough to do small business because it's such a competitive market.GUILFOYLE: So many taxes (ph).WILLIAMS: But that doesn't mean that it's being choked.BOLLING: No, it's not tough (ph) to small business because of competition. It's tough because of regulation and taxes and Obamacare.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE (?): Excessive taxation, overregulation.WILLIAMS: No, yes, that's what -- I'll tell you what.GUILFOYLE: Obamacare is choking the life out of our body.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: .go -- why don't you go to Britain? Go to Canada, you, guys.GUTFELD: I -- I'd like to point out that I am literally a small businessman. Do (ph) we have time for a question?PERINO (?): What business are you in?GUTFELD: What do you expect to get done in the first 100 days as president, quickly?PERINO: I think tax reform and Supreme Court.BOLLING: Build a wall (inaudible).(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: The walls have gotten (ph) 10 feet higher.WILLIAMS: Oh my gosh, the one thing everybody agrees on, Republicans and Democrats -- infrastructure so you're going to see more jobs come out of more infrastructures.GUILFOYLE: Oh, here we go again. We had this -- Supreme Court, crush ISIS and cut back on taxes, and repeal and replace Obamacare.BOLLING: You know what the biggest infrastructure project in the world will be, right?WILLIAMS (?): Tell me.PERINO: Build the wall.GUILFOYLE: Build the wall.GUTFELD (?): The wall.BOLLING: Yes, yes.GUILFOYLE (?): Double ready (ph).GUTFELD: If I was president, build the world's largest robot unicorn and ride it over the earth.GUILFOYLE (?): What a weirdo.GUTFELD: Yes, it's one more thing is up next.GUILFOYLE (?): So weird.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Oh, my god. I'm stuck.PERINO: I'm stuck in an elevator.GUILFOYLE: I'm stuck in an elevator and I can't get out. All right, it's time for one more thing.Dana?PERINO: All right, so I went to dinner last night. And so I.GUTFELD (?): Wow.PERINO: .wasn't watching the news. But when I got home, I was seeing all this stuff about Michelle Obama's speech yesterday, in which she had a prepared speech. She got rid of it and she spoke from the heart and probably one of the most effective surrogates of the campaign turns out to be Michelle Obama for Hillary Clinton.They didn't always get along. But just take a look at one of the things she said last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: The shameful comments about our bodies, the disrespect of our ambitions and intellect, the belief that you can do anything you want to a woman? It is cruel.It's -- it's frightening. And the truth is it hurts.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: And the big news story, Republicans should be aware that this is the kind of emotion that helps you get elected to president. And Hillary Clinton is lucky to have them.It's unbelievable it turned out this way.GUILFOYLE: It really is true. But I think to make your point, she's being authentic and genuine. You can tell when she.PERINO: Yes.GUILFOYLE: .says that's how she really feels and representing -- so yes, she has been a tremendously effective surrogate for her.All right, Greg?GUTFELD: Well, I just have to plug my show. It's called ""The Greg Gutfeld Show.""PERINO: Oh.GUTFELD: It's on Saturdays, at 10 p.m., after the lovely Judge Jeanine. And I have Larry Gatlin, a country music western singer, legend.PERINO: Country western music singer.GUTFELD: The singer -- yes, and Shelby Holiday (ph), which sounds like the name of a really cool car, yes. Anyway, Tyrus impact (ph).GUILFOYLE: Nice, my goodness. It's a good show. I watched it several times. All right, let's see.Juan?WILLIAMS: Incredible -- I mean, incredible video of a great white shark crashing into a diver's cage off the coast of Mexico.GUILFOYLE (?): Oh, my god, I would never ever do this, yes.WILLIAMS: The shark had been attracted with chunks of tuna so the diver in the cage could get a closer look at him. Well, that didn't work out, did it?The shark crashed into the cage, breaking it and then re-emerging through the top. Thankfully, the diver was not harmed. My takeaway, I'm not getting in a cage to go shark watching.GUILFOYLE (?): How about -- how about never?(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD (?): Because it's white, isn't it? It's a great white -- it's a great white shark.GUILFOYLE (?): Oh, do you know (ph).WILLIAMS: I -- I get close enough to you every day. That's enough scare for me.GUILFOYLE: I see the fin on your back. OK, yes, by the way, this is for those of you at home, the blood was the shark's.GUTFELD (?): Oh, thank god. We all hate sharks here. We're anti-sharks.BOLLING: What about Charlie tuna? He's going to complain.GUILFOYLE: He loves sharknado (ph). All right, let's keep it together here.Kimberly's food court -- oh, why (ph).(LAUGHTER).all that shark meat made me tasty, hungry. All right, whatever. Happy -- happy national dessert day. And this is my favorite.Now, many of you might have thought I was dubbed (ph) friscoes (ph) yellow cake. But what I decided to do was Magnolia Bakery which truly in my heart I love. I have cupcakes in my house.They're on display. You can't eat them. Was that your head?PERINO: Oh, yes, because I'm looking at (ph) what I want.GUILFOYLE: OK. So here is the deal. This is banana pudding, which if you have ever --- this is the most unbelievable thing you've ever tasted in your life -- really (ph) tell me quick -- plus the little cupcakes with the sprinkles and everything on there.GUTFELD (?): You've seen cupcakes before, Kimberly?GUILFOYLE: I'm fine, whatever. It's delicious.PERINO: Can I have the white cake yellow.GUILFOYLE: It's red velvet.PERINO: Go Bolling.BOLLING: Should I go? OK, this is happening. Amazing, Colin Kaepernick - - we talked about this. he will be starting for the San Francisco 49ers, even though that -- that protesting (ph) the anthem right there on his knee. But get this, well, LeSean McCoy of the Bills, the Niners are playing at Buffalo.LeSean McCoy, the running back for the Bills, is bringing 15 to 20 law enforcement officers as his guests to the game. This is a must-see game, San Fran at Buffalo.It's a Fox Game, 1:00 p.m. Eastern so check it out. Go Buffalo.PERINO: And then -- and then you can watch Perino and Stirewalt, I'll tell you what, at 5:00 on Sunday live.BOLLING (?): There you go.GUILFOYLE: Look at Dana, so good, guys. This is so good. Do you want some? What? Got teeth (ph) or something?I know we have some punch (ph), 15 seconds. Stay here for this (ph) episode of ""The Five."" That's it for us.
