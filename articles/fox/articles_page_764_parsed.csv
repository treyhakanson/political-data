"Now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine...Hairy SituationExecutives of a Turkish cosmetics company used a popular image on the Internet of one particularly hairy man to sell their hair removal product.But, they should have done their homework.Their poster boy is terrorist and 911 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.A Turkish newspaper reports the company used his picture with the slogan -- quote -- ""The hair will not go away because you keep waiting!"" The Al Qaeda militant seen here after his arrest on terror charges in 2003 is being held at Guantanamo Bay and faces the death penalty if convicted.The cosmetics company says it was an honest mistake.Quote -- ""We didn't know that he was a terrorist...The guy is quite hairy, so we thought his body was a good fit for our ad.""They insist this has nothing to do with politics.Quote -- ""We featured him for his hair not terrorism.""Criminals of the Cloth?Two pastors and a 90 year-old-man in Florida face a fine and possible jail time.Their crime -- feeding the homeless.Fort Lauderdale has new laws dictating standards for where and how food can be given to the poor.Among the requirements a toilet must be available along with the meal.The 90-year-old founder of Love Thy Neighbor Arnold Abbott says that's one stipulation he simply cannot meet.The charges can bring a 60 day jail sentence and a $500 fine.Fort Lauderdale police say the rules ensure legal, clean, and safe distribution of food.Abbott says he is prepared for more charges tonight when he provides dinner to the homeless on a public beach.Two Can Play this GameAnd finally, President Obama has some trash talk of his own for Michael Jordan.The basketball legend made headlines last week for saying that President Obama's no good at golf with some colorful language.Michael Jordan saying -- quote -- ""He's a hack. Man, I'd be all day playing with him...I never said he's wasn't a great politician. I just said he's a s*** golfer.""Well, the president said in an interview with a Wisconsin radio station quote -- ""There is no doubt that Michael is a better golfer than I am. Of course if I was playing twice a day for the last 15 years, then that might not be the case. He might want to spend more time thinking about the Bobcats -- or the Hornets.""A low blow.The NBA team owned by Jordan is off to a slow start, with a 1-3 record."

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST:  Welcome to a special ""Kelly File: Face to Face with the Candidates.""  I'm Megyn Kelly.  We are coming to you tonight from Raleigh, North Carolina.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)Where in less than one week voters right here will take place in the critical March 15th primary.  Can you see all the excitement in the room?  I'm here on stage at the Cavalry Baptist Church with Texas Senator Ted Cruz.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)This is all part of a Fox News prime time lineup of town halls with the GOP candidates.  Greta Van Susteren interviewed Ohio Governor John Kasich earlier this evening.  Sean Hannity will speak with businessman Donald Trump.  And in a special airing of ""The Kelly File"" tonight --    (CROWD BOOING)-- at 11:00 p.m., yours truly will sit down with Florida Senator Marco Rubio.  But, first, at --  (CROWD BOOING)-- stake for the candidates in North Carolina, 72 delegates awarded proportionally.  Currently, the Real Clear Politics average of poll shows Donald Trump with a 10 point lead over Senator Ted Cruz who was in second place --   (CROWD BOOING)-- but the last poll taken in this state was three weeks ago and a lot has changed since then.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)Let's get right to it.  All right, Senator, thank you so much for being here.  Let's start with the obvious question which is, what are your predictions for North Carolina?SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Well, listen, I feel really good here in North Carolina.  We have an amazing team on the ground.  And we are seeing an energy.  We're seeing an excitement.  And, really what we are seeing in North Carolina is a continuation of what we have been seeing all across the country.  You know, if we step back a year ago, we had 17 candidates in the field.  I mean, it was a crowded field and it was a talented diverse field, a dynamic field.  Pretty striking contrast with the Democrats.  (LAUGHTER)You know, this whole year we have seen that field winnow and narrow.  And it's gotten narrower and narrower and narrower.  And then we saw last week, we saw on Super Tuesday and on Super Saturday two tremendous outcomes.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)Where the voters have now made clear that there is only one campaign that has repeatedly beaten Donald Trump.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)And that can and will beat Donald Trump.  And so what we're seeing is Republicans uniting behind our campaign.  KELLY:  But what specifically is the path forward?  Right?  Because it takes 1,237 votes in order to become the Republican nominee and what the odds makers are saying is Ted Cruz would need to win 60 percent of the vote from this point forward in order to win straight out before we get to a contested convention.  And what those same experts are saying is, that's really mathematically impossible unless you win Florida, which even you concede is a long shot.  CRUZ:  Well, listen, I understand that they experts are constantly saying, the conservative can't win at every stage, if it were up to the experts, we would not have won a primary yet.  So, I'm all right with the experts saying that.  KELLY:  They say none of them can win except for Donald Trump straight out before --   CRUZ:  But it's funny.  Those are the same folks that put Donald Trump on every TV station 24 hours a day and then once he is the nominee --   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)And nobody should be confused.  The network execs who give Donald hundreds of millions of dollars of free air time are all liberal Democrats.  They want him to be the nominee because they know Donald gets killed by Hillary and their plan is nominate this guy so they can obliterate him.  Donald may be the one person on the face of the planet that Hillary Clinton can beat in the November general election.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)But you asked path forward.  KELLY: Yes.  What is the path forward?  CRUZ:  So let's talk some real simple math.  It takes 1237 delegates to be the nominee.  I have just over 300.  Donald has about 80 more than I do.  Both of us are within 80 delegates of each other.  The path is simple.  We continue to narrow the field.  If you look at the other two candidates in the field, Marco Rubio, John Kasich, both good, honorable people.  But neither one of them has a path to winning the nomination.  They are far too behind in the delegate count.  They can't catch up.  The path is simple.   We continue to narrow the field.  Head to head, not only do I beat Donald Trump but I beat Donald resounded.  Just today a new poll came out.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)That has me beating Donald Trump by 13 points head to head.  By the way, that same poll has Donald losing to Hillary Clinton and has me beating Hillary Clinton.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)KELLY:  He said he hasn't even started on her.  He believes his numbers against her will get better once he, quote, ""starts on her.""  But I want to ask you because you have talked about a broken convention.  CRUZ:  Let's be clear the media hasn't started on him and she hasn't started on him.  He has had kid gloves for six months from the media and present company excluded.  (LAUGHTER)KELLY:  Thank you.  Let's talk about contested convention and whether that's a likelihood.  Because I know you have said openly, this could be enormous mistake for the party.  And obviously the party would have to be very divided for it to arrive at a brokered convention in July.  But those who want it, some of your backers who don't see an easy path forward for 1237 for you say, I have no problem with the contested convention.  I would rather see that, they say, than to see somebody get the nomination who only has a plurality, who doesn't have 1237.  So if it has to happen ugly, it happens ugly.  CRUZ:  Look, there is difference between a contested convention and a brokered convention.  A brokered convention is the fevered dream of the D.C. establishment.  KELLY:  Mitch McConnell.  CRUZ:  That everyone is divided and then suddenly the D.C. establishment swoops in with their white knight and they're mad at the voters because the voters --   (CROWD BOOING)That's the reaction of the voters.  I think it would be absolutely catastrophic to have a brokered convention where they try to parachute in some D.C. establishment candidate.  You would see an open revolt.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)And it would all but concede the election to Hillary Clinton.  The voters need to decide this.  And that's why our strategy is very simple.  We intend to beat Donald Trump.  But the way to beat Donald Trump is beat him at the ballot box.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)KELLY:  And you haven't yet amassed 1237 and neither has he, let's say it's a two man race at that point, you are okay with the, quote, contested convention where then it goes to a balloting system and it's still decided by the people.  CRUZ:  A contested convention is a different thing where you go if no one gets 1237 and you have got two frontrunners.  Look, Reagan and Ford battled it out at contested convention.  That's what conventions are for.  If you are fighting between the candidates who have earned the votes of the people, and it's the delegates at the convention who have been elected to do that, that's the way the system works.  And that's perfectly appropriate.  But I will tell you I don't believe we are going to need that either.  I believe our path is very simple.  We're going to continue to narrow the field.  When we get head to head with Donald Trump, we are going to beat Donald Trump over and over and over again.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)KELLY:  How does it happen though?  Because what the analysts say is that - - and what you heard Marco Rubio say is that your path will get harder from here.  They points to states like New York and California and Florida, New Jersey, which might not be Ted Cruz territory.  CRUZ:  Well, let's talk about those.  California, the last field poll that was done, I was in first place in California.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)KELLY:  I think they like you.  CRUZ:  Well, North Carolina is God's country.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)But, you know, there is always an analyst saying well, well, there is no way for the conservative to win.  That is what the talking heads always say.  Going into Iowa.  Every pundit says on every show Trump was going to win.  We won an overwhelming title wave landmark victory.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)Then on Super Tuesday.  Super Tuesday Donald was supposed to sweep all over the country.  We won a tremendous victory in Oklahoma.  We won a tremendous victory in Alaska.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)And we won a landslide, historic turnout victory in my home state of Texas.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)And then let's go to Super Saturday.  Super Saturday was supposed to be a great day for Donald Trump.  The pundits, those experts who say we don't have a path, they said Donald was going to sweep all four states.  He had a decisive lead everywhere.  Well, it's interesting.  Kansas, the day of the Kansas caucuses, Marco Rubio had spent the whole day campaigning in Kansas.   That morning, Donald and I were both at the same Kansas caucus site.  We spoke back to back to the same group of voters.  All of the pundits had predicted Donald is going to win Kansas.  Not only did we win, but we won with a landslide nearly 50 percent of the vote in Kansas.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)KELLY:  What the polls showed was that you started really surging later in the week.  CRUZ:  Yes.  KELLY:  And that Trump has started to haven gone down a bit since last week's debate and over the past few days.  To what do you attribute that?CRUZ:  What I see happening is Republicans are consolidating around us.   Sixty five to 70 percent of Republicans recognize Donald Trump would be a disaster.  If he is the nominee, Hillary wins.  Now, Donald's friend has been division.  He wants this field divided.  As long as that 65 to 70 percent is split up among two, three candidates, that helps Donald.  What happened after Super Tuesday is the folks who want to stop Donald Trump had begun uniting around our campaign, and we are welcoming people who are supporters of Jeb Bush, of Chris Christie, of Rand Paul, of Dr. Ben Carson.   We're welcoming.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)We're welcoming people right now who are supporting Marco Rubio or supporting John Kasich, both, good, honorable men.  But neither one of them has a path to defeating Donald Trump.  And if you want to defeat Donald Trump, I would say to you come join us and if we stand together, we'll see the results.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)KELLY:  Stand by.  Stand by because we did take some questions from the audience and we will have some of that coming up with Senator Ted Cruz, including a question about how you work in Washington without losing your soul.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How is he going to get stuff done without losing his soul?  How is he going to get stuff done but still stand for the principles that all of us believe in?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  That was a supporter of Senator Ted Cruz asking the question we have heard from a lot of Republican voters.  Live here in Raleigh, North Carolina, how do you get things done without giving up your values?  And we're back now with Senator Ted Cruz.  That's the question.  They love that you stand on principle.  CRUZ:  Right.  Right.  KELLY:  They believe you.  And they believe you are a constitutionalist and you mean it and you are not going to betray those values.  But they want things to get done if they send you to Washington.  CRUZ:  Absolutely.  And the stakes too high.  The problems are too big for us not to fix them.  KELLY:  How do you do it?CRUZ:  Well, you know, you think about it.  A president really has three levers of authority.  Three levers to change the direction of the ship of government.  The first is executive power.  Now, that's been the one that Obama has abused so mightily.  (CROWD BOOING)The silver ling to that is everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)So, for example, I have pledged on the very first day in office to rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action taken by President Obama.  KELLY:  Do you see the presidency as the weakest branch of government as the one that's supposed to be the smallest?CRUZ:  It is not the weakest branch of government, but it is circumscribed by the constitution and its authority.  And so, when you look, when the President illegally grants amnesty as he has, that is contrary to the law.   It's contrary to the constitution.  But, with the stroke of a pen, that executive amnesty will be gone.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)KELLY:  What are two and three?CRUZ:  Also on the first day in office, I pledge to direct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and to prosecute any and all criminal violations.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)Also on the first day in office I intend to direct every agency of the federal government that the persecution of religious liberty ends that day.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)KELLY:  My question to you is, while they clearly like what they are hearing, what about the day-to-day management of the government and getting deals done?CRUZ:  Well, you are talking about change.  Also on day one, I will direct the Department of Education, common-core ends today.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)Now, you want to talk --  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)Well, you know, under common core we have 11 days in a week.  So, that -- we have a long time until Election Day.  (LAUGHTER)Look, all of those are actions that a strong principled conservative president can do and could do immediately and I will do.  The second lever of presidential authority and change is foreign policy.  And foreign policy can change overnight.  I mean, it's worth remembering in 1981 Iran released our hostages the day that Ronald Reagan was sworn into office.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)KELLY:  But, if I could, I think what this is going for is the things that cannot be done simply by the executive office.  The stuff like entitlement reform was one of the things that I was asked about.  CRUZ:  Megyn, I'm starting more broadly because what the media tells us is you can't fix this.  You can't change that.  And it isn't true.  On foreign policy on day one I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)Also on day one, I will begin the process of moving the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem --  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)Now, let's focus on the third area which is where you want to go, which is legislation.  Legislation is the hardest lever to use because right now Congress is fundamentally broken.  It is dysfunctional.  I am campaigning based on two big legislative policy initiatives.  Number one repealing every single word of ObamaCare.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)And number two, passing a simple flat tax and abolishing the IRS.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)KELLY:  Control of the House and the Senate and the Republican Party if you want to get that done.  CRUZ:  Now, listen, you are right.  And neither of those are easy.  I am not remotely naive or Pollyannaish.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're behind you, Ted.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)CRUZ:  That's actually the key.  Listen, could I get either of those done in this current Congress?  Not a chance.  Because right now the Washington cartel, all of the lobbyists, all of the special interest, they depend on the status quo.  The IRS tax code, the reason it's so long is that's where all the carve outs, all the subsidies, all the handouts are buried in that tax code.  How do you change it?  You know, if you look at the last time we broke the Washington cartel, it was 1981.  It was the Reagan revolution where Reagan took it to the people and there was a tidal wave from the people.  The way we get that done is I intend to make 2016, the general election against Hillary Clinton they referendum on repealing ObamaCare and abolishing the IRS.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)KELLY:  How about immigration?  That was another question somebody had about what you are going to do to secure the southern border and how quickly and I said is that a big issue for you?  And she said I'm worried about ISIS coming across the border.  CRUZ:  Yes.  Absolutely.  KELLY:  Now, I asked you this at the debate but we didn't quite get an exact answer.  What about the Jeff Sessions factor.  Because people for whom immigration is a big issue, they like Jeff Sessions.  You have stood shoulder to shoulder with him.  CRUZ:  I like Jeff Sessions.  He is a friend --  KELLY:  But he endorsed somebody else.  He endorsed Donald Trump.  So what message do people take from that?CRUZ:  You know, I actually trust the voters to make their own determination.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)In 2013, when Marco Rubio was standing with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and pushing the massive Gang of Eight amnesty bill.  (CROWD BOOING)I stood with millions of Americans and led the fight against amnesty.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)And we defeated it in Congress.  KELLY:  Does President Cruz build a wall?CRUZ:  Yes.  But let me point out -- let me finish with 2013.  At that time Donald Trump not only was nowhere to be found.  He was funding the gang of eight.  He gave $50,000 to five of the eight members of the Gang of Eight.   And let me say to folks at home.  One of the most ominous words that was repeated over and over again in that last debate was flexible.  (LAUGHTER)Donald said that over and over again.  Flexible.  He was going to be flexible.  Now you know in D.C., flexible is code word for they are getting ready to stick it to you.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)And let's be really clear what Donald was being flexible on.  One of the most striking moments of that debate, Megyn, is when he turned to Marco Rubio and said, Marco, I agree that you were being flexible and it was a good thing when you negotiated with Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid on the Gang of Eight.  That was a good thing and I agree with it.  (CROWD BOOING)  I almost fell over.  I thought lightning was going to come down.  I mean, Donald Trump has claimed to base his entire campaign on immigration on debate stage, he ran away from it and embraced the compromise that led to the Gang of Eight amnesty bill.  And, as you know, Donald Trump told the ""New York Times"" editorial board everything he said on immigration is just empty campaign rhetoric.  He doesn't plan to build a wall.KELLY:  Well, that's not what he said.  That it was an empty campaign rhetoric.  CRUZ:  How do you know that?  KELLY:  Well, what I know is the ""New York Times"" came out and said there was nothing so shockingly newsworthy and it would change the dynamic of the campaign.  CRUZ:  So, we should take the ""New York Times"" word for it.  (LAUGHTER)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)KELLY:  Well, on that note, I need to stand you -- on that note, I'm going to stand you by because we have much more with Senator Cruz coming up right after this break.  Don't go away including feedback.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Social Security is over $800 billion.  Medicare and Medicaid funding is over a trillion dollars and the Congress has said that these are untouchable, that these are nondiscretionary.  How can we break the gridlock and get through the establishment because quite honestly these are unsustainable programs?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Joining me again, Texas Senator Ted Cruz.  Great to see you.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)So people are worried about Social Security and Entitlement Reform.  We talked about that.  I want to get quick answer on how on earth you would tackle that.  You say, the will of the people.  Can you get any more specific?CRUZ:  Well, listen, when it comes to Social Security.  I think Washington right now is being reckless and irresponsible allowing Social Security to careen toward insolvency.  For a long time Social Security has been treated like the third rail of politics.  If you touch it, you get electrocuted.   Not only am I touching it, am I campaigning on it.  I intend to strengthen and preserve Social Security.  And let me tell you exactly how.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)Four principles.  For seniors -- for those on Social Security and near retirement, there should be no changes, none whatsoever.  We have made promises.  People have ordered their financial affairs.  They need to be able to count on those.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  CRUZ:  But for younger workers, look, you know, I'm 45.  It is hard to find someone my generation who thinks Social Security will be there for us.   That presents a real opportunity for reform.  For younger workers we should follow three principles.  Number one, gradually raise the age of retirement for younger workers.  Give them time to plan and save accordingly.Number two, change the rate of growth of benefits. For younger workers so that it matches inflation instead of exceeding inflation. Those two changes alone bring social security into solvency. But the third one is critical.Allow younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account like a 401K that we own, we control, and we can pass on to our kids and grandkids.(APPLAUSE)KELLY:  Let me get to a couple of other questions that the good people have and go through a few of them. Senator, this is sort of related to the one we discussed but it's a little different. They're worried about the bad people in Washington.CRUZ:  Oh, yes.KELLY:  You know how your mom tells you don't surround yourself with unhealthy people because they can rub off on you. They are worried but losing your soul when you go there. And one of the specific questions was, what will you do to hold on your to your faith and who you are?CRUZ:  Well, look, I mean, a lot of it is being grounded in knowing who you are, starting with a foundation. I'm a Christian. My faith is in the rule of...(APPLAUSE)And I can think of no job for which a relationship with God and a reliance on prayer is more important than serving as president with the responsibility that that position entails.(APPLAUSE)You know, I am blessed with an incredible family. You have gotten to know Heidi and the girls. But by the way, my girls think Megyn is a total rock star.(APPLAUSE)At the debate, I'm there, Caroline and Catherine are like yes, yes, dad, whatever, blah, blah, blah, where's Megyn? I mean, they are so excited to see you.KELLY:  It's mutual. You tell them it's mutual.CRUZ:  It's a great grounding. It is a wonderful -- all right, I will tell a Caroline story. So, every child is different. Catherine, our baby is 5. She is sweet, sweet, sweet. She hugs on you.KELLY:  She takes after Heidi.CRUZ:  She does. She does. And Caroline, who is 7, she is a rascal. She takes after her daddy, poor girl. But you know, she -- her attitude in this campaign is yes, yes, whatever, dad, OK, fine.But there was one moment right before Super Tuesday when Heidi was at home and Caroline was sitting on the couch and was watching, I don't know, may have been Fox News, was watching TV and some commentator was saying well, every -- it would be a disaster for Cruz if Donald Trump wins the State of Texas.And Caroline, my 7-year-old who has no interest in politics jumps up on the couch, sticks both fingers in her ears and goes ""not going to happen. Not going to happen.""(APPLAUSE)KELLY:  And she was right.CRUZ:  And Heidi called to tell me that story and I doubled over laughing.KELLY:  You're grounded.CRUZ:  Beyond grounded.KELLY:  They keep you grounded. I've seen them with all the debates. And I've seen you playing with your girls in between the debates. That must be your secret sauce right there staying connected to them.Another question from one of our attendees today. There is a gentleman here who is a police officer who was injured in the line of duty. And he said he was either too proud or too stupid to take the disability benefits offered to him in the wake of that and then he has struggled ever since.But he has a different perspective on it and he wonders how we can create a mindset among Americans to not -- to not abuse these social net programs...CRUZ:  Yes.KELLY:  ... you know, safety net programs.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ:  Well, let me say first of all to the officer who was here who was injured.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm here.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ:  Thank you.KELLY:  Standing ovation.CRUZ:  Thank you, sir. And thank you to every one of the officers who is here who risk your lives every day to keep us safe.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ:  We are grateful for what you do. And I will tell you this. One of the most disgraceful things of the last seven years has been the treatment of cops.(APPLAUSE)The demonization, the vilification, coming from the president, coming from the attorney general it is absolutely unacceptable. I give you my solemn promise that will end on January 27th.(APPLAUSE)KELLY:  Does he -- yes, to sum it up, the mindset.The question about the social safety net, it's an incredibly important one. My view is the social safety net should be a trampoline and not a hammock. That the entire purpose.Listen, everyone gets down on their luck. Everyone faces hard times. And we need to help people when they are -- when they are in hard times. But the critical object of the welfare programs should be to get people off of the welfare programs.(APPLAUSE)You know, you look at one of the most successful public policy innovation of modern times it was welfare reform in the mid-90s, where millions of people who had been on welfare when they put a work requirement in went out and got jobs.And here is the critical thing that the left doesn't understand, you're not helping anyone by making them dependent. By strapping them in dependency on government.(APPLAUSE)And I believe we need to champion every able bodied adult ought to be working or actively looking for a job and the entire purpose, every one of the welfare programs, even disability programs, people with disabilities are still capable, in many, many cases of doing meaningful work. Maybe not heavy manual labor.KELLY:  This man who has six replaced disk in his neck is chopping firewood right now for a living. Unbelievable.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ:  And when big government traps people in dependency, it saps them of their self-respect. It saps them of the dignity of work of coming home and looking your kids into the eyes and providing for them. And that is integral to achieving the American dream. And it's one of the tragedies of the Obama economy is that so many have been trapped in.(APPLAUSE)KELLY:  All right, Senator Cruz, stand by. Because we have some personal stories and pictures. You have got to see these pictures you have never seen before. Stand by. We are with Senator Ted Cruz on ""The Kelly File."" Live from Raleigh.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Welcome back, everyone, to our special ""Kelly File."" (Inaudible)(APPLAUSE)(CROWD CHEERING)Back now with Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Where there is a lot of enthusiasm for you in this room.I want to take you back to last week's debate that we had in Detroit.CRUZ:  Yes.KELLY:  And the negative feedback that a lot of voters had to it not exactly the moderators, more the candidates and the dialogue that we saw out there, the nature of the discussion. You said the campaign has gone to the gutter. What do you make of it?CRUZ:  Well, listen, I think everyone is fed off with personal insults, with just add homonym attacks. Listen, I have no views whatsoever on any part of Donald Trump's anatomy.(APPLAUSE)I frankly could not care less. And I don't think the voters care either. If other candidates decide they want to just engage in name-calling and insults that's their prerogative, they can choose to do so. But I'm not going to respond in kind. I'm going to keep the focus on substance, on issues, on the problems taken in this country and on solutions. (Inaudible)(APPLAUSE)KELLY:  You had a statement about, you know, children watching that debate and some of the references that were made. And you said we shouldn't be in a position where we feel embarrassed by our president.Now, Trump, in particular, has come out and said I will not be like this as president. You know we are in a rough and tumble campaign. And I know how to behave.  CRUZ:  You know, actions speak louder than words.(APPLAUSE)And Donald has also told us that he will be someone totally different as president. He said he can be the most politically correct person on earth. You know what?Let me talk to a minute - talk for a minute to the folks who are supporting Donald. I understand why people are supporting Donald. You are angry. Look, I'm angry. We are all angry. We are angry at Washington. We're angry at politicians who lie to us. Who lie to us over and over again. They make promises and they don't do what they said they would do.(APPLAUSE)And I understand if you're angry that Trump is the loudest, angriest voice so that feels like a vessel to express that anger. But Donald has, number one, been intricately involved in the corruption in Washington for 40 years.(APPLAUSE)If you're fed up with Washington corruption, you don't support someone who has been supporting liberal democrats from Jimmy Carter to John Kerry to Joe Biden to Harry Reid, to Chuck Schumer, to Hillary Clinton making multiple contributions to her presidential campaign.(APPLAUSE)And, Megyn, the corruption is bipartisan. You're right. He has supported the Washington establishment both the democrats and republicans. He has funded open border democrats for 40 years.But also critically, if you're tired of politicians lying to you. If you think Donald, quote, ""tells it like it is,"" he is telling us he is lying to us.(APPLAUSE)He is saying the day after he is elected he would be someone exactly different than he is. I will tell you, Megyn, the day after I'm elected president, I will be the exact same person I am today.(APPLAUSE)KELLY:  I got to ask you one question. I have got to ask you one question on that. Because he comes after you as you know as, quote, ""lying Ted."" Right, he is calling you lying Ted. And one of the things that you come under fire for is what happened in Iowa with Dr. Ben Carson and that whole thing. Bu there's a report...(CROWD BOOING)There is a reason I'm bringing it up. But there is a report today in Hawaii something similar is happening with your supporters and Marco Rubio in an ad that's gone out that says wasted vote.And Rubio's campaign is accusing you of disgusting tactics because the -- because the e-mail says multiple media reports say Marco Rubio is being pressured to drop out before Florida and his campaign denies it.(CROWD SHOUTING)Do you stand by that? Do you call for that to be pulled?CRUZ:  Well, look, the nature of politics is that when a campaign is flailing, they attack. And they attack other candidates, and they attack their integrity. This particular e-mail apparently came from a volunteer in Hawaii. Not affiliated with the campaign. Not working for the campaign. Not under authorization from the campaign. We have over 200,000 volunteers across the country. I cannot control, nor I do want to control what 200,000 volunteers do.KELLY:  You don't stand by that.(CROWD SHOUTING)CRUZ:  Not only that, our legal counsel sent them a letter saying take that -- take that e-mail down. One volunteer sent out. And, by the way, they forwarded a CNN story that was the lead story on Drudge is what the volunteer did.Now, we asked them to take it down anyway. Why? Because we knew that other campaigns would seek to make political hay out of it use it to try to attack my integrity because the volunteer forwards a story that's the lead story on Drudge to other voters.And we knew that reporters would do what you're doing which is ask doesn't this prove you're unethical that voters are forwarding links to news stories.KELLY:  That wasn't exactly how I phrased it.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ:  I have no idea if the story is true or false. I have no idea. But this is the way -- this is the way politics is played. Where if you have a campaign, where the Rubio campaign they don't want to focus on the issues. They want to talk about Donald's hands. You know, how about focusing on how we solve the problems.(APPLAUSE)KELLY:  And that's exactly where we are goings to pick it up, right after this break. Don't go away. Some stories about Senator Cruz you have never heard with some pictures you have never seen but you need to.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)KELLY:  And welcome back to our special ""The Kelly File: Face to Face With the Candidates."" (Inaudible)Senator Ted Cruz is with us. (Inaudible) Now one very important subject and that is family.So, we went back and found some old pictures of you, Senator. Your campaign was good enough to provide us with a couple of these. You haven't even seen this yourself. But I take you back to Princeton. It was late '80s, early '90s? So, a boy from Houston makes into Princeton University, his father told him he went there on missionary work, right?CRUZ:  That was true.KELLY:  And they say nobody like Ted Cruz back -- no one has ever like Ted Cruz, they didn't like him back in college. I ask you how a conservative like you could ever have been liked at Princeton University.CRUZ:  Well, listen. You know, it's -- there are some loud mouths to like to throw insults. I tell you I had an incredible time in college. I was very, very active on the debate team.KELLY:  Did that help you now?CRUZ:  Sure. And it was great fun. I mean, to be honest, I think I probably learned as much if not more from debate as I did from my studies and had a lot of close friends on the debate team. I was active on student government. I was the chairman of the university council. And I had wonderful friends.But listen, I'll admit Princeton was a daunting place. I mean, it -- you know, I came from a family where my mother was the first in her family to go to college.KELLY:  Here's your debate team.CRUZ:  You know, my dad came from Cuba with nothing as an immigrant. And I didn't come from money. Listen, Princeton, a lot of the kids are rich.KELLY:  Right.CRUZ:  They come from privilege. Their families are masters of the universe. I graduated from Second Baptist High School, a little bitty Christian school in Houston, Texas.(APPLAUSE)KELLY:  You must have had some amazing grades.CRUZ:  My graduating class was 43. No one from the high school that ever gone to any Ivy League School before and we didn't know anyone who had ever gone to an Ivy League School.KELLY:  This is great. Can you see this? Put that back up so he can see it. There's a lot of hair. Yes. A lot of hair.CRUZ:  Yes. That was the unfortunate -- you know, look. Teenage years.KELLY:  It was the '80s. Early '90s.CRUZ:  Yes. My hair actually got down to my shoulder blades for a little while. It was a...KELLY:  And you decided to take that look to Harvard law school. And he hadn't had enough to Princeton. He decided to go on to Harvard Law School.CRUZ:  But thankful I cut my hair by then.KELLY:  OK. And joined up for the Bush v Quayle. We have a picture of the cigar and the t-shirt.CRUZ:  Well, and that was actually election night party in 1994 when republicans took Congress.KELLY:  Not Bush v Quayle.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ:  And that '94 we set up, you can see on the back of the wall there, we had all of the outcome state by state and putting check marks up. You have to understand, Harvard Law School is packed with liberals.Now there were bunch of us that were conservatives. Those are couple of good buddies in mine and we're celebrating the party. And we're just rocking the dorm and you can hear all of the liberals just -- I mean, weeping and gnashing their teeth.(CROWD CHEERING)That was a good night.(APPLAUSE)KELLY:  And then you went on to meet your beautiful wife Heidi, married, two beautiful girls, and now serving your country for many years. Thank you very much for your time.CRUZ:  Yes. Thank you. Thank you, Megyn.KELLY:  And thank you, Raleigh! Thank you all. Thank you.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

"Now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine...Hairy SituationExecutives of a Turkish cosmetics company used a popular image on the Internet of one particularly hairy man to sell their hair removal product.But, they should have done their homework.Their poster boy is terrorist and 911 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.A Turkish newspaper reports the company used his picture with the slogan -- quote -- ""The hair will not go away because you keep waiting!"" The Al Qaeda militant seen here after his arrest on terror charges in 2003 is being held at Guantanamo Bay and faces the death penalty if convicted.The cosmetics company says it was an honest mistake.Quote -- ""We didn't know that he was a terrorist...The guy is quite hairy, so we thought his body was a good fit for our ad.""They insist this has nothing to do with politics.Quote -- ""We featured him for his hair not terrorism.""Criminals of the Cloth?Two pastors and a 90 year-old-man in Florida face a fine and possible jail time.Their crime -- feeding the homeless.Fort Lauderdale has new laws dictating standards for where and how food can be given to the poor.Among the requirements a toilet must be available along with the meal.The 90-year-old founder of Love Thy Neighbor Arnold Abbott says that's one stipulation he simply cannot meet.The charges can bring a 60 day jail sentence and a $500 fine.Fort Lauderdale police say the rules ensure legal, clean, and safe distribution of food.Abbott says he is prepared for more charges tonight when he provides dinner to the homeless on a public beach.Two Can Play this GameAnd finally, President Obama has some trash talk of his own for Michael Jordan.The basketball legend made headlines last week for saying that President Obama's no good at golf with some colorful language.Michael Jordan saying -- quote -- ""He's a hack. Man, I'd be all day playing with him...I never said he's wasn't a great politician. I just said he's a s*** golfer.""Well, the president said in an interview with a Wisconsin radio station quote -- ""There is no doubt that Michael is a better golfer than I am. Of course if I was playing twice a day for the last 15 years, then that might not be the case. He might want to spend more time thinking about the Bobcats -- or the Hornets.""A low blow.The NBA team owned by Jordan is off to a slow start, with a 1-3 record."

Claire McCaskill on new controversy facing Clinton	"This is a rush transcript from ""Fox News Sunday,"" August 14, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.CHRIS WALLACE, ANCHOR: I'm Chris Wallace.Governor Mike Pence in his first Sunday show interview since becoming Donald Trump's running mate, only on ""Fox News Sunday.""(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: On his role in the campaign.Are you the cleanup crew?Top Republicans declaring never Trump.They say we can't trust Donald Trump to be commander-in-chief.And Trump's claim President Obama and Hillary Clinton founded ISIS.Now, Trump says that he was being sarcastic. So, Governor, which is it?Governor Mike Pence one-on-one. It's a ""Fox News Sunday"" exclusive.Then, new questions about the relationship between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department. We'll talk with Senator Claire McCaskill, a top Clinton supporter, about the possibility of an FBI investigation.Plus, the candidates clash over the economy.HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: He wants America to work for him and his friends at the expense of everyone else.DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Every policy she has tilts the playing field towards another countries, at our expense.WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel what their plans will do for your pocketbooks.All, right now, on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)And hello again from FOX News in Washington.Well, it's been quite a week for both presidential candidates. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton laid out their programs to get the economy growing faster and both had to deal with new controversy. Trump from more self-inflicted wounds, Clinton from still more e-mails that showed a cozy relationship between the Clinton Foundation and her State Department.On Friday, we traveled to the governor's residence in Indianapolis, home of the Republican vice presidential nominee, Mike Pence. In his first Sunday show interview since the conventions, we talked about the challenges facing both campaigns.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: Governor Pence, welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday"" and thank you for inviting us here to the governor's residence.GOV. MIKE PENCE, REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Thanks, Chris. Welcome back to Indiana.WALLACE: Do you believe that Hillary Clinton was involved in a pay-to-play arrangement as secretary of state with big donors of the Clinton Foundation?PENCE: Well, it looks that way more and more every day, doesn't it? We -- the new e-mails that have been made public just in the last week seem to make a direct connection between favors done by State Department officials and major foreign donors to the Clinton Foundation. The American people have a right to know.I think people of this country are tired of the pay to play politics in Washington D.C., and I promise you that when Donald Trump and I arrive at the White House, we're going to bring all of that to an end.WALLACE: Do you have any evidence that she actually took action as a result of these big donations? And when you say, the American people have a right to know, do you think there should be an investigation, a federal investigation?PENCE: Well, certainly, there are officials at the FBI. We also found out this week -- believe that there should be an investigation, and Obama's Department of Justice apparently has shut that down. But look, these are very serious allegations. Now, we have evidence in writing, in this e-mail chain, of connections between foreign donors to the Clinton Foundation and --WALLACE: But did she take action in response to that?PENCE: Well, I think that's what we need to find out. We really do. The public has a right to know, because this -- really and truly, this is exactly the kind of pay to play politics the American people are sick and tired of.But frankly, it is just one more example of the way I do believe that the Clintons have been operating over the last 30 years.And it's one of the reasons why the American people have a fixed opinion about Hillary Clinton and her trustworthiness, and why we so much need to elect Donald Trump as the next president of the United States. It's important for our security, for our prosperity, but also, we have to make sure that the highest standards of ethics are in the highest office in the land, and that will happen the day Donald Trump becomes president of the United States.WALLACE: Now, Donald Trump has opened a new line of attack against Hillary Clinton saying that she and Obama were the most valuable players for ISIS.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: ISIS is honoring President Obama. He is the founder of ISIS. He's the founder of ISIS. He's the founder. He founded ISIS. And I would say the co-founder would be crooked Hillary Clinton.(END VIDEO CILP)WALLACE: You and he spent a day defending his remarks, saying that they were serious. Now, Trump says that he was being sarcastic.So, Governor, which is it?PENCE: Well, I think he was being very serious, and he was making a point that needs to be made, that there is no question that the failed policies of President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in the wider Middle East, created a vacuum within Iraq in which ISIS was able to arise. There's essentially no question --WALLACE: So then why is he saying he was sarcastic?POENCE: Well, he was making a very serious point, and look --WALLACE: Forgive me, why did he say he was being sarcastic?PENCE: Well, he was making a very serious point. Donald Trump has a way of talking to get people's attention, and it's drawn attention to a very important issue.There was a time when any Democrat president knew where the buck stopped in the White House. And the responsibility for the failed policies in the Middle East that created the environment where ISIS developed belongs to President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the American people know that.WALLACE: Governor, those are all perfectly legitimate points to make, but that isn't what Trump said. He said that Obama and Clinton were the most valuable players of ISIS, that they were the co-founders of ISIS. Then he said, well, I was just being sarcastic about that, just as he said he was just being sarcastic about inviting Russia to come in and release e-mails of Hillary Clinton's.Isn't the sarcastic excuse getting a bit old?PENCE: Well, no, I don't think it's getting old at all, Chris. Donald Trump made his way through a very competitive primary because he spoke not like your typical politician, but just plainly like an every day American. And speaking plainly is exactly what the American people will anticipate in the course of this election, but more importantly, they're going to have a president who tells them exactly what's on his mind, and the American people are going to hear and hear him loudly.WALLACE: Trump is making what your campaign calls a major speech on Monday about radical Islamic terrorism. Up to this point, he has not offered really any details as to how he would beat ISIS. So what is his plan?PENCE: Well, get ready. Monday in Ohio, I'll be with him on that day. He'll do exactly what he did this last Monday on his economic plan. He's going to lay out his vision and his strategy for defeating radical Islamic terrorism.WALLACE: Specifics?PENCE: I think you're going to be ready, Chris, for a vision, but also for real specifics about how new leadership in the White House, a change of direction in the White House and the kind of broad shouldered leadership that Donald Trump will bring is going to make our country more safe.WALLACE: But this week, 50 former top national security officials, all of the Republicans, said that they could not vote for Donald Trump. So did the respected, moderate, Republican Senator Susan Collins, and what they said was that he's too reckless to be president.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN (RET), FORMER NSA & CIA DIRECTOR: We all felt strongly enough about what we believed to be a clear and present danger that we felt compelled to say what we said.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: We're talking, here, sir, about a senior senator, former head of the CIA, two former secretaries of homeland security. They say we can't trust Donald Trump to be commander-in-chief.PENCE: Well, I'm old enough to remember a president that you covered a few years back who, when he was running for president in 1979 and '80, they were saying about the same thing.WALLACE: But there was never that kind of mass defection from the Republican --PENCE: Well, I think there was just as much criticism of Ronald Reagan's broad shouldered approach to foreign policy.And so, I understand when a lot of people in the establishment that have been part of the very policies that have put the world stage in the condition that it is today have anxiety about the clear-eyed leadership that he's going to bring.WALLACE: Both Trump and Clinton offered their economic plans this week, and there were some big differences, especially on taxes. Trump cuts taxes on the rich, Clinton raises them. Trump wants to repeal the estate tax, which already exempts the first $5 million for an individual. Clinton raises the estate tax. And Trump wants a new tax deduction to cover childcare expenses. Clinton says, expanding the childcare tax credit helps lower income families more.Question, Governor: why shouldn't middle class families look at those two plans and say that at least on taxes, Clinton offers them a better deal?PENCE: Oh, I think -- I think, not only middle class Americans like my wife and I, but every American knows that the pathway to prosperity in this country is not going to be found in raising taxes. Hillary Clinton is planning over a trillion dollars in tax increases and --WALLACE: But it's all on the rich (ph).PENCE: That 47-minute speech she did, I was told there was over a trillion dollars in new spending.And what Donald Trump laid out was in a very real sense, what's worked here in Indiana, what's worked in Republican-led states around the country, and that is, you let people keep more of what they earn. You unleash the power of this economy by rolling back regulation and red tape, repealing Obamacare. You end the war on coal, and develop all the energy resources of our land, and then you have tougher and smarter trade deals, and that'll get this economy moving again.Hillary Clinton's plan is just more of the same old, same old failed policies that have led us to a place where, Chris, we're in the middle of the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression.WALLACE: Trump would also cut all business income to 15 percent -- then Clinton says, the result of that is that Trump would give himself a big tax cut. She even has a name for it. T(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Let's call it the Trump loophole. Because it would allow him to pay less than half the current tax rate on income from many of his companies. He'd pay a lower rate than millions of middle class families.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: The Trump loophole?(LAUGHTER)PENCE: The United States has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the western world, Chris, and it's driving jobs out of this country, and Donald Trump's committed not only to cutting taxes across the board for every American, but also lowering the corporate tax rate so that businesses large and small can be competitive.WALLACE: But, Governor, what we're talking about here is something called pass-through business income, and analysts say 2/3 of that income goes to the top 1 percent. So if he's cutting the income tax rate for this kind of business income, 2/3 of it is going to the top 1 percent. They're making out, not the middle class.PENCE: I don't think the American people spend the time that people on the left and Hillary Clinton and her supporters spend picking winners and losers in the economy. The American people know that if we have the right policies, everybody wins. And we're living in a time where now for more than a decade, real personal income has been stagnant. And so, you know, I know that Hillary Clinton and her team said that the expectations that Donald Trump articulated were wildly unrealistic.Well, what I think is wildly unrealistic is electing the same people with the same ideas and expecting a different result.WALLACE: Let's do a lightening round -- quick questions, quick answers.You had an interesting exchange with a young man on the campaign trail recently.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED BOY: I've been noticing that you've been kind of softening up on Mr. Trump's policies and words. Is this going to be your role in the administration?PENCE: Sometimes things don't always come out like you mean, right?(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Are you the cleanup crew?(LAUGHTER)PENCE: I couldn't be more honored to be campaigning shoulder to shoulder with a man who I believe is going to be the next president of the United States.WALLACE: But you do have to clean up. You do have to explain some of the things he says.PENCE: Well, look, we have different styles, but as I told that little boy, we have exactly the same convictions. We both believe we can make America great again. We'll return to those time honored principles of standing tall on the world stage, rebuilding our military, unleashing the full potential of the American economy, and letting the American people stand tall again.WALLACE: Trump has banned reporters who he thinks are unfair from attending his campaign events. You said you were going to talk to him about that? Have you gotten him to lift the blacklist?PENCE: I don't think Donald Trump is having any problem getting press at this point.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: That's a serious question, his banning people, and I know you have a strong feeling about a free press. Have you gotten him to change his mind?PENCE: We'll keep our private conversations private, but that's an ongoing discussion in the campaign, and I'll -- I do believe in the public's right to know, whether it's about these latest allegations about Hillary Clinton or otherwise, and we'll continue that -- we'll continue to advance that principle.WALLACE: You have been running for office, winning office, serving the country, for about a quarter of a century. When you hear Donald Trump go after a Gold Star family, when you hear him refusing to endorse someone like Paul Ryan, when you hear him suggest that he might not defend our NATO allies -- as a serious man, do you ever shake your head?PENCE: I really couldn't be more honored to be standing shoulder to shoulder with Donald Trump. Look, he's not someone that spent a lifetime in politics. He speaks his heart and he speaks his mind.And I truly do believe, this good man is going to be a great president of the United States.WALLACE: People are increasingly concerned about his temperament because of the statements he makes in public. What would you say to people who have those doubts? May think, gee, I'm not crazy about Hillary Clinton, but I'm scared of Donald Trump?PENCE: I would say, stay tuned, very early in this campaign. This coming Monday, you're going to see a vision for confronting radical Islamic terrorism. Last week, you heard a bristling approach to having a growing economy.WALLACE: So you're saying, don't give up on him?PENCE: I'm saying stay tuned. It's still early in this campaign, and I'm just very confident.WALLACE: Let's talk about you and your record. You signed a religious freedom law last year that, under heavy fire, you agreed to soften. So let me ask you personally -- do you believe that a business owner, a person who owns a bakery, a photography shop, whatever, should have the right to refuse to serve a gay if he feels that it violates his religious convictions?PENCE: Chris, if I was in a restaurant and I saw someone denied service because they were gay, my family wouldn't eat there again. I don't believe in discrimination and I don't support discrimination against anyone.But when there is a conflict of rights here in our society, those are the proper purview of the courts. And I do believe that the efforts we made in Indiana contributed to being able to resolve those things as Americans have done for generations.WALLACE: Finally, you signed an abortion bill this year that bans a woman for getting an abortion because her fetus has genetic abnormalities. Now, I know that you would like to see Roe versus Wade reversed. But given the fact that it's still the law of the land, why does the state have the authority to limit the reasons a woman has to end her pregnancy?PENCE: Well, I'm pro-life, I don't apologize for it. I'd like to see Roe versus Wade overturned and consigned to the ash heap of history.We took a stand in the state of Indiana, that frankly many countries have taken, that abortions for the reason of race or sex are morally offensive, and we stand by that. But we also cherish those who have disabilities in the state of Indiana, and taking a step in the direction of protecting the unborn -- who are facing physical challenges and disabilities, I think was the right thing to do.WALLACE: And you still believe that, that a woman should not be allowed to have an abortion --PENCE: Well, it's before the courts right now, and the courts will resolve that matter --WALLACE: But you still believe that?PENCE: I believe in the sanctity of life, and I stand for that principle, and I'm grateful to be standing with Donald Trump in his strong commitment to the right to life.WALLACE: Governor, thank you. Safe travels on the campaign trail.PENCE: Thank you.WALLACE: Please come back, sir.PENCE: Great to be with you.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: Up next, Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, one of Hillary Clinton's earliest supporters, responds to Governor Pence and to new questions about links between the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton's State Department.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: E-mails are back in the news, raising more questions about the relationship between the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton's time as secretary of state. This as polls show Clinton pulling ahead of Donald Trump in key swing states.Joining me now from St. Louis, Senator Claire McCaskill, one of the first members of Congress to endorse Clinton for president.Senator, the State Department released more emails this week under a lawsuit that raised serious questions about the link between the Clinton and the State Department when Hillary Clinton was the secretary there.You just heard Governor Pence say that the American people have a right to know if there was a pay to play situation. Do you support the idea of an investigation?SEN. CLAIRE MCCASKILL (D), MISSOURI: Well, first of all, let's give this context, Chris. This was a right wing partisan organization, Judicial Watch, that has been after Hillary Clinton for decades. They got thousands of e-mails. They released two of them, trying to give the perception of a problem.But if you really look at those two e-mails, one was about recommending a former staffer for a job and other was just somebody who wanted to give the State Department information. There's no evidence that Hillary Clinton ever changed anything she did in the State Department based on any activities of the Clinton foundation. There's none.WALLACE: Well, let's take a look at that second case that you're talking about. This involves a fellow named Doug Band who was a top official at the Clinton foundation. He e-mails Huma Abedin, one of Secretary Clinton's closest aides, to arrange for Gilbert Chagoury, who contributed at least $1 million to the foundation, to talk to a top U.S. official.Senator McCaskill, you don't have a problem with big donors to the foundation getting favors from the State Department?MCCASKILL: Well, first of all, all this gentleman wanted to do was give information. He was asking for nothing. He --WALLACE: But we don't know that.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: That's what Gilbert Chagoury says. Gilbert Chagoury is a fellow who has been in trouble with the law, had to give back millions of dollars. He says he wanted to talk to tell them about what his insight into the election in Lebanon. We don't know if that's true.MCCASKILL: Well, we do know this. We know there's no evidence based on what the State Department has said in the last few days, based on all of the investigations that have been done around an unprecedented release of e-mails in government, that there are no laws that have been broken. There was no evidence there was any pay-to-play.And, frankly, this is a distraction for the Trump campaign, which is a dumpster fire at this point. I think they are anxious to try to get people to look over here, look over here, because if you look at what Donald Trump is saying and doing, it is in many ways frightening.WALLACE: Well, I'm going to get into that in a minute. But I do want to ask you one more question with regard to this. You say that there were no favors done. Let's talk about another case, Rajiv Fernando. He is -- was a securities trader who gave at least $1 million to the foundation and was appointed to the international security advisory board, Senator, although he had absolutely no qualifications and no experience in that area.MCCASKILL: I'm not sure that was a good idea. On the other hand, I think everyone kind of glosses over the fact that this foundation was doing charitable work around the world. I mean, how much time has been given to really talk about the work of the Clinton Foundation. This wasn't money going in the Clinton family's pocket. This was money going to fight malaria and AIDS and to lower child mortality around the globe.The idea that anyone who gave millions to the Clinton Foundation --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Senator, you certainly can't argue that that justifies putting a big donor on an official advisory board who had no experience in that area and when his -- that fact that he was on the board was revealed, he quit within 24 hours.MCCASKILL: Well, I will just say, I don't know why he quit. I don't know why he was appointed. I do know this. No one has been investigated more than Hillary Clinton in the history of presidential politics.And I know that when Jim Comey was lauded by the Republicans prior to him saying no law had been broken, they changed their tune when he didn't give them the answer they wanted. And, frankly, Donald Trump is on a campaign to undermine law enforcement in this country by eating at the very fabric of trust in the FBI which I think is really unfortunate.WALLACE: All right. Let's talk about the economic plan that Clinton unveiled this week and let's go through it. She would raise taxes $1.2 trillion over the decade as I said to Governor Pence, almost all of it on the rich. She wants $1.4 trillion from more in government spending, including $275 billion more for infrastructure and she wants more regulation.Question, Senator, isn't that more of the same Obama policies that have given us the weakest recovery since 1949?MCCASKILL: Well, I would argue that Trump's economic plan is more of the same, because once again, it's all about helping the 1 percent. I don't think that Donald Trump understands that most Americans are frustrated at stagnating wages and the shrinking of the middle class.It's a real contrast between these two economic plans. One is about, yes, infrastructure, which we desperately need. It's a government function and it's good jobs. The other is about giving himself a tax break.You know, same old, same old. Let's take care of the wealthy in this country while middle class families are struggling to figure out if they can afford to send their kids to college. I think she is representing the change in terms of what our economy really needs. He's representing exactly what we've got now.WALLACE: But, Governor, you're talking about stagnating the middle class and no wage increases for the middle class. Clinton is talking about higher taxes, more regulation, more government spending. That's been the Obama policy for the last eight years.Isn't she offering the same old, same old?(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Let me say in terms of infrastructure, there was a big stimulus package and when Obama first came in and we still have got to all these problems and a weak recovery.MCCASKILL: Well, we certainly did a better job coming out of the deep hole that the Bush administration left us in in most countries of the world because of our stimulus program. We had month after month, I think 74, 75, 75 straight months of job growth in this country because of the economic policies of this administration.But we know we have to do more. We have to make sure that college is a reachable goal for all Americans. Not just Donald Trump's family. We need to make sure that the rich pay their fair share, which clearly they are not right now.So I that I what we're looking at here is one candidate with specificity laying out a real roadmap for the middle class, the other one taking care of himself which should be no surprise.WALLACE: Let's turn to Donald Trump's charge that Hillary Clinton was one of the founders of ISIS. Now, while that was clearly over the top, the fact is that she was the secretary of state at the time that the Obama administration pulled all U.S. troops out of Iraq. She was the secretary of state who was pushing President Obama to intervene in Libya, which helped create a vacuum that ISIS has helped filled.Doesn't she bear some responsibility if not the founder, some responsibility for the rise of ISIS?MCCASKILL: Well, first of all, the language that Donald Trump has used as it relates to ISIS is disrespectful to the military that is out there fighting ISIS every day.Just last week, Chris, we took out eight tankers in ISIS, we took out mortar, we hit a tactical unit. We have shrunk the area of ISIS in Iraq by 40 percent. We'd shrunk the area of ISIS in Syria and serious by 20 percent.The men and women that are risking their lives every day through the orders of their commander-in-chief, when they hear a presidential candidate try to act like our president is on the bad guy's side, how do you think that makes them feel as they're out there in the field fighting?WALLACE: In fairness, Senator, he isn't criticizing her in any way or denigrating the work of the military. He's saying that President Obama and Hillary Clinton made some bad decisions that have led to the present situation.MCCASKILL: Well, you can -- there's a lot of reasons that ISIS rose up. One of them was the status of forces agreement known as SOFA that Bush negotiated. We couldn't leave our troops in Iraq even if the president wanted to because the parliament in Iraq was refusing to give them immunity.Now, Trump probably thinks the SOFA, the status of forces agreement, is a gilded couch at Mar-A-Lago. He probably doesn't know what SOFA is. But that was a very relevant part of this.It was also important to realize that Assad, by what he did in his country, allowed ISIS to move into what was then Iraq -- al Qaeda in Iraq into Syria and get strongholds and recruit. That was the work and support of Putin who is Trump's best buddy. So, you can say Trump and his friend Putin are the founder of ISIS, which probably would be more accurate than calling out the commander-in-chief in that way.WALLACE: Well, I'm glad for that last comment. That will certainly get Donald Trump's attention.Senator McCaskill, thank you. Thanks for your time this week. And it's always good to talk with you.MCCASKILL: Thank you.WALLACE: Up next, more on the controversies facing both candidates. We'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss that and the growing Clinton lead in the polls.Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the Clinton Foundation and a potential FBI investigation? Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Coming up, Trump and Clinton lay out their plans for the economy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: There will be no change under Hillary Clinton.CLINTON: I will have your back every single day that I serve.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday group about the candidate's ideas on taxes, trade and spending.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Donald Trump simply does not have the temperament to be president and commander in chief of the United States.TRUMP: Hillary Clinton said, I don't like his tone. See, I don't like her temperament, because her temperament is the temperament of a loser. We need a tough temperament.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump each getting personal about why the other is unfit to be president.And it's time now for our Sunday group. Syndicated columnist George Will, Bob Woodward from ""The Washington Post,"" Charles Lane also from ""The Post,"" and Rachel Campos-Duffy, the national spokesperson for the Libre Initiative, a nonprofit that education Latinos about conservative positions.Well, it's hard to keep up with all the controversial things that Donald Trump says. Here are the highlights just from this week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don't know.Having a tremendous problem in Utah. Now, Utah's a different place and I don't know if any -- is anybody here from Utah? I mean, it's -- I didn't think so.So I said, the founder of ISIS. Obviously I'm being sarcastic. Then -- then -- but not that sarcastic, to be honest with you.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Wow.Rachel, you are a Trump supporter. Does any of that give you pause?RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, THE LIBRE INITIATIVE: Well, let me just say, personally, I think when -- for me personally, I think between Trump and Hillary, I'm a hash tag never Hillary. My organization is a nonprofit that's nonpartisan.WALLACE: Right. Right.CAMPOS-DUFFY: So I'm here representing them.Just, listen, here is the -- here is the lesson from this week for him. If this campaign is about Trump, Trump loses. If this becomes about Hillary, her corruption, if it becomes about Supreme Court judges, if it becomes about her dismal record as secretary of state, then I think he has a shot of winning.I just want to point out one double standard here. Back in April, Hillary said, quote, ""his insulting language towards Muslims is making him the recruiting sergeant for ISIS."" This was not even a blip in the news cycle, and I think it's more proof that the media focuses on things that make, frankly, all of you guys, and me included, a little nervous, things that Trump says, versus things that she has done that ought to scare us. Things like the corruption, the lies, the lack of conscience and, of course, making the world more dangerous under her watch.WALLACE: Other than that she's doing a heck of a job?CAMPOS-DUFFY: Other than that, she's doing great.WALLACE: Trump's self-inflicted wounds and/or the coverage of it seems to be catching up with him. There were some bad numbers from key swing state polls, and let's put those up right now. In Florida, Trump is now down five. In North Carolina he's down nine. In Virginia, Trump down 13. And in Colorado, down 14.Chuck, we're three weeks from -- still from Labor Day, tomorrow. How serious is this?CHARLES LANE, ""THE WASHINGTON POST"": It's terribly serious for Donald Trump and it's especially serious in the following way. Every time he's gotten into trouble in the past, his answer has been to say, look at my polls or look at my ratings. He has been fetishistic, really, about the way he harps on his poll numbers and so forth and so on. That has been his answer to everything.Now, he doesn't have that answer. The polls are showing that the American people, especially in these swing states, are being turned off by the things that he's saying. There was a theory of a Trump victory that went something like this. He will take some old blue states and turn them red. Now what's happening is purple states are turning blue.WALLACE: Like Utah?LANE: Well, people are talking about --WALLACE: The red states.LANE: He could lose Utah, yes.WALLACE: Then there's Hillary Clinton and these latest e-mails, which certainly seem to indicate a cozy relationship between the Clinton Foundation and big donors there, and Hillary Clinton's State Department. Bob, what do you make of all this money going to the foundation or going for huge fees for Bill Clinton's speeches and how the State Department treated those people?BOB WOODWARD, ""THE WASHINGTON POST"": No, I mean serious unanswered questions. But if -- if I can step back just for a moment, I mean what's going on here? What's this all about with her and with Trump? In -- in -- in the case of Trump, I have really no idea what he might do if he ever became president. If you look at the statements, the proposals, the ideas, it's a kind of a garage sale and I don't know that there's a Rembrandt behind that lawn mower that won't start. But I haven't seen it. And he has not communicated that. She has somewhat communicated what she would do. But the e-mails, her personal e-mails, remember, the FBI director said there are thousands of e-mails, work-related, that were not turned over. There are those top secret discussions, very, very serious. You find --WALLACE: Let me just pick that --WOODWARD: Yes.WALLACE: Let me just pick it up, though, on the foundation, because that was the new news this week. And -- and one case, Doug Band, who was, as we pointed out, a top official at the foundation. The Clinton campaign says well, no, no, he wasn't working there, he was working as a personal aide, which he was also, to President Clinton, not in his role as a top official of the foundation and not as the head of the Clinton Global Initiative. But isn't that part of the problem, that this -- this public and private all got mixed up?WOODWARD: Of course, but -- I mean the e-mails all go together. It's not just the Clinton Foundation. What's on her personal e-mail server? I mean, you know, look at -- thousands of things that were not turned over. You find Democrats talking to reporters who cover national security asking, do you know anything? What's going on? They're holding their breath that there might be something here that would be damaging to her candidacy and, even worse, damaging to the national security.WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and we asked about the Clinton Foundation. We got this on Twitter from John Carney. He tweeted, ""why did Justice Department not pursue this?,"" about the links to the Clinton Foundation. ""Was Obama giving Clinton another free pass?""George, how do you answer, John? And do you think the links between the nexus, between the foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, the big fees for the Clintons' speeches, and her work as secretary of state is going to be a problem for her in this campaign?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: It will be if the media makes it such. That is the IRS scandal, the defining scandal of this administration, the suppression of advocacy by conservative groups simply died from media lack of interest. You used the phrase a moment ago, Chris, the -- that the public and private got tangled up. Hillary Clinton looks at the world through the lens of progressivism. Now, progressive believes that the government should be everywhere and in everything. That everything is political. A natural consequence of progressivism is a blurring of, ultimately the erasure of the distinction between the public and private series of life. Therefore, it is natural to flow from that, that you would send a State Department employee to New York to work on foundation business, that foreign governments with interest in the State Department would give to the foundation and the things would get tangled up.Now, will this matter in the end? First of all, it's complex. Second, it's very hard to demonstrate. And you saw Claire McCaskill denying it. A quid pro quo connection. That's always hard. Third, there's the question of, will the media drive this. And, finally, with the Clintons responding always, this is old news, the question is, can they run out the clock between now and the Election Day? And my answer is, probably.WALLACE: Well, the clock has run out for this panel, but we're just going to take a break. And when we come back, Clinton and Trump lay out competing visions for America's economic future. We'll drill down into their proposals on taxes, trade and jobs when we come right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: There is a myth out there that he will stick it to the rich and powerful because somehow he's really on the side of the little guy. Don't believe it.TRUMP: All Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same, more taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy and on American production. More of that.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump each arguing why they're the one to get the economy growing faster. And we're back now with a panel.George, how do you compare the Trump and Clinton economic plans when it comes to taxes and spending?WILL: Well, they agree on two things. One is the infrastructure. They wanted to use this low -- the low cost borrowing environment to double down on that. Second, they want to change tax treatment in some way or another to repatriate the $2 trillion that are parked overseas of American corporate earnings.She, Trump is absolutely right, wants to double down on the regulatory state, more regulations, higher taxes, more government allocation to wealth and opportunity in society. She thinks it works. He wants to double down on the 1980s, that is the simulative effect of tax cuts and lighter regulation. The problem is, both of them discuss this without looking at the architecture of the federal budget.Sixty-seven percent of the budget goes to entitlement programs. Another 7 percent to debt service. Another 17 percent for defense. For those of you keeping score at home, that's 91 percent of the federal budget. A few more uncontrollables in there, and you wind up with 6.5 percent of the federal budget is discretionary spending. And they're going to do all of this with that? It defies belief.WOODWARD: Yes, it's a pipe dream. And --WALLACE: For both of them, you're saying?WOODWARD: Yes. Yes. I mean lots of the -- the money is not there and if Hillary Clinton --WALLACE: And (INAUDIBLE) is talking about entitlement reform.WOODWARD: Yes. I mean and -- and even Barack Obama thinks that you -- in his heart he has said, yes, we -- it -- it's inconceivable that we don't have some sort of entitlement reform because that's almost all of budget and soon will be. But there -- there is this obstacle, at least as best we can tell from the polling, called the Republican House of Representatives. And if Hillary becomes president, these things aren't going to happen. And, I mean, I think George and -- is kind of saying the liberal progressive state is at least stalled in the middle of the road right now.WILL: A big -- big problem is the American people. That won't put up with any entitlement reform.CAMPOS-DUFFY: But there is an opportunity here. I just want to talk -- I mean rolling back regulations will stimulate business opportunities for -- for Americans. And I think, if you don't mind, I want -- just want to talk really quickly about Hispanics, because this is a very important demographic. This is the most entrepreneurial demo in the country. They start businesses at three times the rate of the average American. There's an opportunity for Donald Trump, as a very successful businessman, to talk about how his plan will help them start new businesses, make it easier for them to create them, make it easier -- roll back taxes, and, frankly, he's not taking that opportunity and -- and he might have actually ruined any chances by some of his earlier comments.However, there is an opportunity, especially in Florida, as you know, which is a very important state, we have a thousand Puerto Rican families moving a month, people who have experience in real time the effects of big, unsustainable government. There's a conversation to be had and I don't think that campaign is taking advantage it.WALLACE: Chuck, do you think it's fair -- this is the question I raised with Claire McCaskill, that Hillary Clinton's plan, which is tax cuts -- or tax increases on the wealthy, more regulation, more spending, more government spending, things like infrastructure, is basically Obama 2.0.LANE: Well, in a way it's -- to just Democratic Party doctrine going back decades, I mean in that sense, yes, it is Obama 2.0 because Obama was a Democrat.But what strikes me as new and different about the Democrats this year is the abandonment of free trade and free trade agreements. Hillary Clinton herself, as secretary of state, supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership that Barack Obama has championed with Republican support and has been forced off of that by Bernie Sanders and by Donald Trump.When I looked at these two speeches this week, what I saw was over here you have Donald Trump, which is a grab bag of protectionism and tax cuts for the rich, and Hillary Clinton's was a grab bag of protectionism and tax increases for rich. The only difference between those two plans is that Hillary's polls slightly better because the market, if -- if -- if you agree with the poll, the market for taxes increases on the rich is strong. So whether it's old Democratic medicine or not, it's more popular.WALLACE: Let's -- let's play because both candidates did speak about trade and it's been one of the big issues in both the Republican and Democratic races. So let's hear what they had to say in their speeches this week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Mr. Trump may talk a big game on trade, but his approach is based on fear, not strength.TRUMP: Hillary Clinton has supported the trade deals, stripping this city and this country of its jobs and its wealth.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: George, your thoughts about how trade is playing out in this campaign. At least Trump has been consistent. You can argue -- you can argue whether he's right or wrong, but at least he's been consistent in this campaign. Clinton has really done about a 180-degree flip on trade.WILL: Trump is a consistent 19th century Republican. When the party believed in tariffs and the federal government was funded by tariffs and sale of land. Since -- subsequently, we have an income tax and things have changed. Hillary Clinton has just, as you say, done a somersault. She has a certain versatility of conviction and it shows in this case particularly. The amazing thing is that no one since the 19th century, no one since around McKinley, has won running on protectionism. And this year is going to be the difference because someone opposed to free trade is going to win.CAMPOS-DUFFY: I -- I --LANE: But the -- excuse me. The political center in this country on that issue has shifted. And it's between Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump has brought that about.CAMPOS-DUFFY: Absolute --WOODWARD: I get -- you know --WALLACE: Well, let's let Rachel --WOODWARD: Go ahead.CAMPOS-DUFFY: I was going to say that I agree with you, that it has shifted. And I don't think that people are against trade, I think they just -- that there's a new way to message about it. And -- and I think it's -- it's really unfortunate that in this campaign we've seen a denigration of trade. I think it's a lot more complex in Wisconsin. I just talked to a -- I live there. I just talked to a dairy farmer who likes Donald Trump, likes the way he talks about law and order, but says, hey, I export my milk. So I think that there has to be a new way to talk about trade and there has to be a better -- better solution than we've been offering.WOODWARD: But the trade bump, I mean has -- it has become the idea of a new trade deal has become forbidden. I mean Hillary Clinton said in her speech, I'm a -- was against it, I am against it and I will be against it as president, the Pacific trade deal.WOODWARD: So, you know, again, a lot of this is just talk. What's actually going to happen? I -- I mean I have to look at the week as a whole and I think Bernie Sanders did something quite brilliant this week, he bought a -- proving that he's a man of the people, he bought a third home, a vacation home, on Lake Champlain so he can go there and write his memoirs about the revolution that didn't quite happen.WALLACE: Yes, as they say, the one thing they're not making more of, his real estate.Thank you all, panel.Up next, our ""Power Player of the week."" ""The Barefoot Contessa"" makes cooking easy and fun.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: She says entertaining is hard. The trick is to make it easier. As we told you last October, she's been pulling that off for more than 17 years, building an army of devoted fans. Here's our ""Power Player of the Week.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)INIA GARTEN, ""THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA"": When you cook, everybody shows up. Who's going to turn down a home-cooked meal. They're so rare now.WALLACE (voice-over): Ina Garten is one of America's favorite home cooks. ""The Barefoot Contessa,"" as she's known, has created a food empire. There are the cookbooks.GARTEN: I've written nine.WALLACE (on camera): How many books do you have in print?GARTEN: I don't know. Well over 10 million.WALLACE (voice-over): And the show on The Food Network she's been doing 14 years.GARTEN: How good does this look? It's really like a vegetable stew. I would say, dinner's served.WALLACE: Which is why the place was packed at an appearance in Washington last fall.GARTEN: If I want to do like a French apple tart, I have an idea what the flavor, the texture, the scale, everything about it. And then I keep making it until I get it absolutely right. And sometimes I can do it on five tries and sometimes it takes 25 tries.WALLACE: That is Garten's goal, create recipes for cozy meals that look the same on your table as they do in her cookbook.GARTEN: You can make something really simple and have the same amount of fun.WALLACE (on camera): How do you make it simpler? How do you make it more fun?GARTEN: I always try and do three things for dinner. One that's made in the oven, one that's on the cook top, and one that was made in advance. So it's -- it's kind of -- not a balancing act, it's a really easy thing to do. So I plan it really well.WALLACE (voice-over): But Garten's path could not have been less planned. In 1978, she was working in Jimmy Carter's budget office on nuclear energy policy and not liking it. When she saw an ad for a food store in Westhampton, New York, its name, The Barefoot Contessa.GARTEN: I saw this tiny store. It was like the size of these two chairs. And there was somebody baking cookies in the kitchen. And I thought, this is where I belong.Where have you been all day?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who, me?GARTEN: The mystery. Where have you been?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was up and about. And might have done a little shopping.WALLACE: Her husband, Jeffrey, a professor and former dean of Yale Business School, has been her best friend along the way, and a featured character on her TV show.GARTEN: I think everybody thinks he's goofy because he always has -- does these like crazy, goofy things. He's really smart. And he's just a wonderful, wonderful guy.WALLACE: Garten built a barn next to her house in the Hamptons where she tests her recipes and tapes her show.GARTEN: There's a wonderful Oscar Wild quote, ""work is easy, fun is hard."" And I think people are really drawn to people having fun and I love what I do and I think it really translates.WALLACE (on camera): How long? How long are you going to continue?GARTEN: Until they drag me out by my feet.This gives it a really nice complex flavor.Every recipe is like a science experiment. And when I'm done with it, and there's that little ping in my head that says, that's what I was looking for, it's extremely satisfying and I love that.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: Ina isn't done yet. In October she releases her tenth cookbook ""Cooking for Jeffrey,"" about her husband's favorite recipes and their 47-year marriage.Now a follow-up on last week's ""Power Player."" Katie Ledecky made history this week, sweeping the 200, 400 and 800 meter freestyle swims at the Olympics and setting two world records along the way. She also swam two relays, winning gold and silver. A ""Power Player"" indeed.And that's it for today. Have a great week.
