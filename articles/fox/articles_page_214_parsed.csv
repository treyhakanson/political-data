Politics of Stimulus, Economy and the Ground Zero Mosque

"	"This is a rush transcript of ""Special Report With Bret Baier"" from August 18, 2010. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The economy is getting stronger, but it really suffered a big trauma. And we're not going to get all eight million jobs lost back overnight.But what we're trying to do is create sort of a virtuous cycle where people start feeling better and better about the economy. And a lot of this is sort of like recovering from an illness. You get a little stronger each day.MARK MELLMAN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: The problem is people don't feel better. They look around, they don't see an improvement in their own lives. They don't see improvement in the lives of their friends and relatives, and that leads them to think the economy is still in bad shape. That sets an important context for these elections in 2010.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: The president of Ohio today and a Democratic strategist there talking about the economy. The president traveled for the ninth time since taking office to Ohio. The vice president heads back for his eighth visit to Ohio next week.Let's take a look at the latest polls. The presidential approval number in Gallup today stands at 41 percent. Then the president's handling of the economy, approval 41 percent, disapproval, 56 percent -- this is a record in this poll. And is the economy in better shape than it was 18 months ago? Better, 38 percent, then you see worse or about the same, 29 and 32 percent.What about all of this, the politics heading to the midterms? Let's bring in our panel, Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard; Julie Mason, White House correspondent for Washington Examiner, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Bill, thoughts?BILL KRISTOL, EDITOR, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: I guess 17 visits by President Obama and Vice President Biden to Ohio. I read that Ohio lost about 160,000 jobs during the Obama-Biden administration. They are losing 10,000 jobs a visit. Maybe they should ask the president and vice president to stay away and the job loss might halt.The economy is hurting President Obama badly. He went to Ohio with the Democratic governor, Ted Strickland, and there's a big gubernatorial race to succeed him. If you listen to Mitch Daniels, the Republican governor of Indiana, speak, one of his big talking points is Indiana is doing better than its neighboring state Ohio. Incidentally, West Virginia which has a Democratic governor is doing better than Ohio. Ohio's unemployment rate is two percent higher than West Virginia's, which is pretty startling.Anyway, contrast his policies in Indiana with the Democratic policies of Ohio which have been like President Obama policies, which Daniels says, at the national level.I think Ohio will be interesting. If Republicans win the governorship and the senatorship in Ohio, that's a real, as you say, President Obama and Vice President Biden going there so much, it becomes a real referendum because it has a Democratic governor in addition, a real referendum on Democratic economic policies.BAIER: Julie, other candidates -- Democratic candidates -- are having a hard time with the economy and the message perhaps. Richard Blumenthal in Connecticut, candidate there, a Democrat, said this about the stimulus, quote, ""I believe that the stimulus was wrongly structured because it failed to provide jobs and paychecks to ordinary Americans. It unfortunately was inadequately designed to invest in infrastructure and roads and bridges and schools.""He said he would vote against it as it was structured. That's an interesting talking point from a Democrat.JULIE MASON, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: It is. And it's certainly a theme that emerging in this campaign. You don't see the Democrats running very hard on the stimulus.And even today, what struck me about today's event, Bret, watching the president, how much new stagecraft the White House is doing. We saw in the AP poll, he got a 41 percent approval rating for the economy, but his overall approval rating was 49 percent. And the gap -- the difference is people still like him personally. So we see him in his shirt sleeves in a kitchen and then out in a yard, and it was very deliberate by the White House. There was a picnic table and a tree-house. And you see the president really playing up his likability factor more than the specific message of the economy.I think we will see more of that from the White House.BAIER: Charles, but the White House is defending the stimulus saying it created or saved 2.5 or 3.6 million jobs is the line we've heard from Vice President Biden many times.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, that's not going to help and the tree-house is not going to help and the short sleeves aren't going to help.Look, he bought the economy when he did the stimulus. He was a month into the presidency. This is a $1 trillion bet he had the American people buy on to. And it failed, at least the overwhelming perception is.Democrats think it's all politically toxic. They are not the ones who bring it up. It's Republicans who bring it up. And when you bet $1 trillion dollars and you know you added $1 trillion to the debt and no results, in fact, negative results, you own the economy.And so he does, you know, the routine where he says the Bush drove us in a ditch, you want to give him the keys? That's kind of worn -- it's not going to work. Eighteen months in, you own it, and if you had a policy at the beginning, like Reagan with the tax cuts, he bought it as well. And they were hurt badly, the Republicans in the midterm election in '82, as a result of a weak economy because he owned that economy.I think what is really interesting is that there's an axiom in politics that by mid-summer people's perceptions of the economy is fixed and that carries into the Election Day. Even if the numbers between now and then change a bit, it's not going to alter perceptions.We heard earlier there is a poll, only 12 percent of Americans think the economy improving. It was twice as high a year ago. And that's perfect reflection of the real economy. A year ago, the growth in GDP was twice what it was in the quarter that has just passed. That's the impression that is settling in and it's unchangeable between now and November. And that's why Democrats are going to lose.BAIER: Bill, it was interesting to hear Mark Mellman, the Democratic strategist, talk as openly as he did about Democratic issues on the economy.KRISTOL: I know Mark. I was wondering, you know, when his phone was ringing, Rahm Emanuel on line one. ""Mark, you're not supposed to say that.""Look, it is a big problem. The perceptions are bad. And to pick up on what Charles was saying, economy rallied pretty strongly in the fourth quarter of 2009 -- I think it was plus 5.7 percent. It was down to about plus 3.4 percent in the first quarter; I think 2.7 or something in second quarter. And it's going to be, I'm told, revised down --(CROSSTALK)BAIER: Under two.KRISTOL: Maybe one, 1.5 as the new data coming in. That is a big problem.I mean, they did the stimulus, they got the bounce. But to have it peter out this quickly is terrible politically.With Reagan, we went through tough times the country did in 1982. Reagan said stay the course. But he can say plausibly, the tax cut's coming on January 1, 1983. We're going through these tough times, but better times are ahead. And luckily for Reagan, better times were ahead.But the trouble that Democrats have, what is their narrative? What is going to get it going in 2011? A tax hike? I don't think so. More regulations? Where is their growth package?BAIER: Log on to the home page at foxnews.com/specialreport to get ready for tonight's online show starting at 7 ET.Up next, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi goes after critics of the planned mosque near Ground Zero.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: I look to my colleagues in New York, some of them have different views on the subject. It's up to them to work it out. But there is no question that there is a concerted effort to make this a political issue by some and I join the -- those who have called for looking into how is this opposition to the mosque being funded?REP. PETE KING, R-N.Y.: For Nancy Pelosi to suggest there's going to be an investigation of these people is absolutely outrageous, it's disgraceful and, to me, the speaker was really out of line on this.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi weighing in for the first time on the mosque controversy. She later thought to clarify her first public comments, saying that she thinks the funding for actual mosque project should be looked in to as well.Now we have the president weighing in, saying he has no regrets about his statements after being asked in Ohio. And this just in, this afternoon, former Vermont governor and former presidential candidate Howard Dean weighed in as well, telling WABC radio, ""This is something we ought to be able to work out with people in good faith. I think another -- I think another site would be a better idea. I would look to do that with the cooperation of people who are trying to build the mosque,"" saying another site may be better.So what about all of this and the politics, the policy? We're back with the panel.Julie, let's start with you.MASON: Well Bret, you hear all this lamenting about this, turning this in to a political issue. It's too late -- it's a political issue. Someone needs to step up. We heard Obama kind of parsing middle distance on this over the weekend and today saying no regrets but not really going any further than that.This is a terrible issue for the Democrats. Someone needs to step up and clarify where the party stands on this.And meanwhile, Republicans are fighting with each other, too. Pat Buchanan said that Newt Gingrich went too far on the issue. So now we have gone in a parallel universe.(LAUGHTER)BAIER: Bill?KRISTOL: I'm still getting my head around that parallel universe.Howard Dean also says building the mosque where it is going to be built with the intention behind is it a real affront to the people who lost their lives on 9/11. I am happy to agree with Howard Dean.BAIER: You agreed with Senator Reid and Howard Dean.MASON: I feel like I don't know you.KRISTOL: I'm a bipartisan kind of guy.(CROSSTALK)KRAUTHAMMER: Well, are you a liberal or are they neo-cons?(LAUGHTER)KRISTOL: I like the idea of Howard Dean becoming a neo-con. He really dislikes Obama, the truth is, and he's happy, I think, to take a little bit of a shot at the Obama administration and lay the groundwork for his primary challenge to President Obama a year from now.BAIER: Now Bill --KRISTOL: You heard it here. Don't you think Dean would love to primary Obama?In any case, he'll be anti-Afghanistan, anti-the war and anti-the mosque, so it will be the best of all worlds in the Democratic primary.Look, when Obama said no regrets today, it was a funny thing to say. It almost sounded -- it's the kind of thing you say when you lost. You know? It's finished. It's over, but no regrets. ""Je ne regrette rien"" -- that great Edith Piaf song. I won't sing it here for you --BAIER: Thank you.KRISTOL: Disappointing to the viewers. Wonderful song, though.And I do think deep down the Democrats know this is over and I would suspect they're going to put some private pressure now on the imam and on the developer to pull the plug on this over the next week or so, I should think.BAIER: Charles?KRAUTHAMMER: Well, I spent the afternoon wrapping my mind around Pelosi's remark about looking into the finances of those who oppose the motion. I want to join with others. I'd like to know who the others are. Are any of them non-institutionalized?And then I'm trying to decide if the statement was out of malice or sheer lunacy. And being the generous soul I am, I go with lunacy. I mean, after all, the implication that Debra Burlingame, the sister of one of the pilots who died on 9/11, would have to be secretly paid to express her anguish over the establishment of a monument to Islam in a place where 3,000 were massacred in the name of Islam is obscene.Look, looking into the financing of the mosque is logical. We know there is a history in this country of fake charities which are funneling money to terrorist organizations. They've been investigated. We've had -- this is a real issue. It's not a hypothetical, it's not a can-be.But the idea that those who oppose the mosque are some kind of conspiracy or funding ought to be looked at is absurd. Look, I oppose the mosque. No one has offered me a penny. What am I, chopped liver? I need a new roof.(LAUGHTER)BAIER: Julie, you mentioned Republicans split on this. Is it, do you think, a powerful political issue heading 70-plus days in the midterms?MASON: Well, it almost is, but I think we're to the point people are overplaying their hands on the issue. It's just gone just a little too far. So it could have been, but now it's kind of gone a little crazy. And the Democrats don't know what to do. The Republicans are kind of screwing it up. So it's hard to see who gets the benefit.BAIER: And last thing, prospects of actually moving this site, David Paterson, the governor of New York, others saying they are negotiating or trying to.Bill?KRISTOL: I think the developer who has real money at stake will decide at some point he doesn't need all this. And it's nice that Imam Rauf has made a big splash here with his provocative decision to try to build a mosque right near Ground Zero, but I think he will pull the plug on it."

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: ""Impact Segment"" tonight. It looks like Hillary Clinton will announce her presidential run in April, at least that's what the Wall Street Journal is saying. But with the rise of the internet and no editorial standards in many precincts, this upcoming presidential race promises to be an unbelievable smear experience. Mrs. Clinton is a strong woman, and whoever the republican candidate is better be strong as well because the invective is going to be flying on both sides.Joining us now from Washington, Lauren Ashburn, contributor to ""The Hill."" And Howard Kurtz, host of Media Buzz on Sunday's 11 a.m. on FNC. You disagree with that assessment, Howard?HOWARD KURTZ, FNC HOST, ""MEDIA BUZZ"": I think you're being restrained, Bill, it's going to be a cesspool, because you have more media, more ideological, quicker on the trigger and lower standards. Here's a classic case, ""Daily Beast"" just had to retract to completely bogus story about Scott Walker saying he was trying to cut funding for sexual assault reporting at universities of Wisconsin. It was completely false.O'REILLY: Right.KURTZ: He was picked up from Jezebel, a Gatsby women website, it was all over twitter and all over social media. These things just get out there and then they get walked back after somebody decides to check it.O'REILLY: Hillary Clinton has got a big advantage, Lauren, because the main stream media, the pipeline as Howard just laid it out is accurate. It starts in these obscure places, then it goes into the bigger political websites and then it goes into the printed newspapers, cable TV, whatever. That's to the pipeline, okay? And there are, very, very few checks and balances anymore. It's just like, okay this is a good story and we're going to throw it out there, and the accusation of always, you know, the retraction is always this big and the accusation is huge and people don't see the retraction. But Hillary Clinton has got an advantage because the pipeline favors her in the third tier. The most of the main stream national media is going to root for her as they did with Barack Obama or am I wrong?LAUREN ASHBURN, ""THE HILL"" CONTRIBUTOR: No, you're absolutely right. And what we're going to see is the main stream media encouraging a demolition derby of the republican primary candidates and we're going to see things like we saw with Jeb Bush and ""The Washington Post"" reporting on his wife's jewelry spending. Yes. Hillary Clinton we do know has been around for 25 years and there's not a lot that we don't know about her. You know, we know about little rock, we know about Bill Clinton's affair, we know -- I mean we know --O'REILLY: We know a lot about it, but talk radio in particular is going to hammer her. You know, everybody knows that, some of it is legitimate, certainly her 10-year secretary of state has been, you know, I mean, not a slam dunk success. Let me throw something at you here.KURTZ: Go ahead.O'REILLY: Now, this is a rumor and I usually don't put rumors out there. But I'm going to do it tonight because I want to show you everybody how vicious this stuff is. Herman King. I saw what happened to Herman King last time around. Alright? There was accusations against him by certain people. I have been told on a very reliable level, but I cannot report it because I don't use blind sources as fact, I want everybody to know that what I'm saying is not fact, that these women were paid, they were paid to say things about Herman King and they were paid by democrats and when you get into a situation where there are websites that can print anything they want and there are people who fund the websites, gazilionaires, you got money to be spread around. And I believe it, I believe it, I believe it, I believe it. Go ahead, Howie.KURTZ: Well, in the case of Herman King, there were also lawsuit against places he works. Some of each were settled but rather than we litigate out, go to your larger point, which is with all these new apple groups digging up dirt, sometimes spreading it to the main stream media, sometimes throwing it up on the web where it goes viral, this is a real problem. I'm going to push back a little bit on the Hillary Clinton for example, yes, she is going to get more favorable treatment than a lot of republicans who have never been vetted because there haven't been national figures. But in recent 10 days, the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post have dug into that a great job digging into the outrageous foreign government donations to the Clinton Foundation.O'REILLY: That's different, though, Howard, that's a news story, that's not a personal attack. That's a new story and I have no problem with news stories on anyone. It's the personal attack. Let's get Lauren the last word.ASHBURN: The personal attack.O'REILLY: I like the demolition Derby line, I think that's exactly what this thing is going to be. Go.ASHBURN: You know, the personal attacks are the big problem. I have had them, I'm sure a lot of other people have had them and there is no way of correcting them, Bill, because it's a lose, lose situation.O'REILLY: Right.ASHBURN: Right. You either respond to these idiots and then you get into a food fight, right? Or you don't respond and then it looks like you're guilty of something you didn't do.O'REILLY: I wouldn't know anything about any of that. Lauren, Howard, thank you.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Politics of Ground Zero Mosque; General Petraeus' Media Blitz

"	" This is a rush transcript of ""Special Report With Bret Baier"" from August 16, 2010. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : As a citizen and as president, I believe that Muslims have the right to practice their religion as everyone else in this country.(APPLAUSE)That includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower Manhattan in accordance with local laws and ordinances. This is America and our commitment to religious freedom must be unshakable.I was not commenting and I will not comment on the wisdom of making a decision to put a mosque there. I was commenting very specifically on the right that people have that dates back to our founding. That's what our country's about.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: The president making remarks Friday at the White House and then clarifying those remarks Saturday in Florida. Now there is a lot of firestorm politically from Republicans and now Democrats as well. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid through a spokesman says this, quote, ""The First Amendment protects freedom of religion. Senator Reid respects that but thinks that the mosque should be built someplace else.""What about the fallout from all of this? Let's bring in our panel tonight: Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard; Nia-Malika Henderson of The Washington Post, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. You think I could say the name correctly after all these years.Charles, let's start with you. What about the dustup after this weekend, what the fallout is?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, when you consider the sequence of events, it begins with the White House saying this is a local issue; we are not going to comment. Then you get the president ostentatiously endorsing what appears to be the mosque at a Ramadan dinner to a Muslim audience, which is not a great act of courage -- that audience likes hearing it.Then it turns out a day later 1,000 miles away he says on camera as we heard, but I was only addressing the legality of it. That's not addressing anything. We all agree on legality. It's the propriety, the decency of this on which he doesn't comment, but it does imply he might have a few questions about the propriety of it.And then you get the White House saying it was not a walk-back. It was walk-back. It was a revocation. You get whiplash out of all of this. What happened was the president made a strong statement, hailed as a courageous one at the dinner at Ramadan. But it wasn't a matter of courage. Courage would have been that audience, a Muslim audience, he should have said, yes, I believe in the legal right -- you have every legal right to do it -- but I would appeal to you as Americans -- after all, I'm the president, not a judge, not the Supreme Court, I don't decide on legality, but as president, I speak on behalf of the spirit of America -- that you ought to consider decency and propriety of establishing house of worship dedicated to Islam at a spot where people were murdered in the name of Islam.Obviously there is a distinction between murderers and religion. There is a no question about that. But this is place where you might want a non-denominational place of worship, as you have in hospitals, a place of meditation. But establishing a mosque in that area is a provocation. The president should have said that, he didn't. He missed an opportunity. And I think he alienated all sides here.BAIER: Nia, some Democrats are scratching their heads. And now you have the Senate majority leader putting out a statement. Other candidates are putting out statements. How troublesome is this as an issue politically?NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, WASHINGTON POST: It's troublesome for now. I think it's yet to be determined whether or not this is going to last until November. You know, obviously economies is what people are focused on.I think for now, I mean, some of the points that Charles articulated, this idea it's about the First Amendment on the one hand but also maybe this should be placed somewhere else. This looks like a place that Democrats can essentially stake out. We saw Reid do that. So, in some ways I don't necessarily know that it's clear it's only a problem for Democrats, because on the stump they can essentially articulate whatever position they want. There isn't going to be any record of voting for this. They are not going to have to vote for this in Congress or anything.So I think they will have enough room to articulate things in the way that they want to.BAIER: The issue when you poll it, Bill, the latest Fox News Opinion Dynamics poll has it this way -- ""Do Muslims have a right to build a mosque near Ground Zero?"" Yes, they have the right, 61 percent. Now the question of building the mosque, an Islamic culture center near ground zero, is it appropriate -- 30 percent; is it wrong, 64 percent.The polls seem to be able to differentiate between the right and whether it is right.BILL KRISTOL, EDITOR, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: As does Harry Reid. I agree with Harry Reid. I've wanted to say that for three and a half years. For three and a half years he's been Senate majority leader and I don't think I've ever said that on this set or maybe anywhere else. But I'm bipartisan kind of guy.(LAUGHTER)The Reid-Kristol position, if I call it that, is that of course there are legal rights to use private party in accordance with the local laws, but the mosque should be built somewhere else.What do they say about property, location, location, location? This is about the location. Governor Paterson, the Democratic governor of New York, about a week ago offered the builders and the imam -- Imam Rauf -- we will help you find another place that's half a mile away where you won't face the questions about your intention and you won't offend a lot of people and he was turned down, it appears.So this is not finding a place for worship for Muslims in lower Manhattan. This is making a statement, and I think a provocative and offensive statement to many Americans right at Ground Zero. And that's what I think Harry Reid's comments bring out very well and that is something that President Obama I think will have to express an opinion about at some point.BAIER: Charles, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg spoke out today saying this -- ""If we shout down a mosque and a community center because it's two blocks away from the site where freedom is attacked, I think it would be a sad day for America.""Now, we just pulled up The New York Times from December 8, 2009, where it describes the Burlington Coat Factory and the staff in there saying ""there was no immediate sign that the fiery cataclysm, but out of the blue suddenly stained with smoke, a plane's landing gear assembly, the size of a World War II torpedo, crashed through the roof and down through two empty selling floors of the Burlington Coat Factory."" That's from The New York Times in 2009. That is the building.KRAUTHAMMER: That is the building. And it hasn't been mentioned at all. In fact, if this hadn't happened it would still be a sacrilege, I believe, to be on the edge of the vicinity of Ground Zero.But this in fact, the fact that you cite, means that the site was a point of attack. This was Mohammad Atta's plane which he was using as missile to indiscriminately attack Americans and destroy and kill as much as he could. And a piece of that missile, that airplane, went through the roof on that site. That is a point of attack of 9/11. It's not even peripheral area. And that makes it all the more a provocation.BAIER: Last thing -- Nia, if Democrats had a problem with positioning today, they had another person speak out today, and that is the cofounder of Hamas. Take a listen quickly:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)AL-ZAHAR, HAMAS CO-FOUNDER: We have to build everywhere. In every area we have to pray and this mosque is the only site of prayer especially for the people when they are looking to be in a group, not an individual.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: So what is your sense? Does this thing blow over? Is this August, that we are covering this too much? Or is this a real big issue?HENDERSON: My sense, I think it's popular to say everything ends up being a political issue, but my sense is it will blow over by November and it won't necessarily be an issue. The Democrats, point of fact, might have a way to do something that a lot of them wanted to do and that is distance themselves from Obama on some issue.BAIER: Last word, Bill?KRISTOL: The only way this blows over is if they move the mosque.BAIER: What do you think is the most important factor in the mosque controversy? Logon to our homepage at FOXnews.com/specialreport. Vote in the online poll, right there on the right of the screen.Up next, General David Petraeus goes on a media blitz and his boss goes on the clock.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEN. DAVID PETRAEUS, US/NATO AFGHANISTAN TROOPS COMMANDER: We have to really put our shoulder to the wheel and show during the course of this year that progress can be achieved. And again, one manifestation of that out there is that you have this date. But again, we have had good dialogue on this and I think the president has been clear in explaining that it's a process, not an event and that it's conditions-based.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: General David Petraeus in Afghanistan on a bit of a media blitz this weekend, talking to The Washington Post, New York Times and ""Meet the Press.""Also we learned today from a Foreign Policy magazine interview, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said this about his job, quote, ""I think that by next year I'll be in a position where you know we're going to know whether the strategy is working in Afghanistan. We'll have completed the surge. We will have done the assessment in January and it seems like somewhere in 2011 is a logical opportunity to hand off."" He's saying he may be done sometime in 2011. Not a surprise, perhaps.What about all of this? We're back with the panel. Nia, first to General Petraeus being the face now and essentially saying July, 2011, is really conditions-based. And he's going to make the recommendations he is going to make to President Obama.HENDERSON: You heard the White House saying today that there is no daylight between their feelings about this drawdown date and General Petraeus.He definitely has -- I don't think it's probably accurate to say this is his war. He definitely has been the face of this war. It is one place I think the administration has been consistent with the messaging. You saw Petraeus. He's on his media blitz. Obviously, on the one hand, striking, you know, a command of the military. But also speaking politically and kind of being the political face of this war and trying to suggest that this is going to be hard -- this war, this drawdown, the pullout -- the conditions on the ground are improving somewhat, but obviously speaking to some Democrats and the public, who are kind of sour, quite frankly, on this war.BAIER: He doesn't answer a question better than most. He does not wade too much, Bill, in the politics of things.What about this push to get Petraeus out there talking about it?KRISTOL: He does a lot of things better than most.I think the irony of the fact that Bob Gates, secretary of Defense, and David Petraeus, commander in Iraq, probably more than any other two people pulled off the surge in the last two years of the Bush administration over bitter opposition of the Democratic Party in the House and Senate, including then-Senator Obama and then-Senator Biden and then-Senator Clinton. That those two are now central to the Obama administration success in the most important, probably one of the two most important foreign policy fronts they're facing, but they have to win the war in Afghanistan for many reasons, I think. It's one of those little ironies of history.I would say that I think Bob Gates genuinely intended to leave at the end of 2008. If you look at interviews he gave in mid-2008, he said over and over, I want to go home, I want to go home. President-elect Obama asked him to stay. He stayed.I think now he intends to leave probably mid to late 2011, after the July 2011 date, I think when he thinks things are on a decent path. But I honestly believe if President Obama says why don't you stay for the whole first term that Bob Gates will feel that that's the right thing to do.So I wouldn't be surprised to see Gates and Obama -- Gates and Petraeus as the two key executors of Obama's Afghanistan policy for the next two years.BAIER: Charles?KRAUTHAMMER: I would agree. I mean, this is really -- ironies abound. Here we are three years ago, Petraeus arrives in Washington with an ad calling him ""General Betray-us."" And Senator Clinton at the time, said listening to him requires suspension of disbelief, which is a rather sharp questioning of the man's integrity.Here we are three years later, he's the face of the war, which I think is more than ironic. I think there is something odd about this. The president is the one who made a decision. He comes in office and he has two wars on his hands. He decides Iraq, he wants to wash his hands of and he's out. All he's done has gotten us out.Afghanistan is a war he embraces. He decides this is a war that is important -- a just war he wants to win it or succeed in it in some way. He triples our forces there. He gives one speech in December, 2009. Generally speaking he stays away. He talks about the economy, autos, he talks about green energy, he talks about batteries. He doesn't speak about a war which is essentially his war. Not in the Michael Steele way that he invented it. But he embraced it. He said this is important, I commit America to it as we're leaving Iraq.And who speaks on his behalf? Petraeus, a general. I mean, that's OK, but that is not the way it ought to be done. If the president wants to give a sense of seriousness of commitment and for Afghans to make a decision who they will support, to believe, he has to show he is committed. Otherwise, you get a sense of he's half-hearted in all of this.BAIER: Quickly, Nia, Defense Secretary Gates, he does have a big role in this administration.HENDERSON: Yes. He does have a big role in this administration. And as I was reading the Foreign Policy piece when it said he was going to leave in 2008 and now essentially that he's going to leave in 2011, I kind of thought to myself, I wonder if he even leaves in 2011 if the president comes and says, hey, we still need you as secretary of defense, if he, you know, essentially decides to stay.BAIER: Panel, thank you.Content and Programming Copyright 2010 Fox News Network, LLC.
