5	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/07/25/bernie-supporter-im-upset-disappointed-not-surprised/	Bernie supporter: I'm upset, disappointed, not surprised	"This is a rush transcript from ""On the Record,"" July 25, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Florida delegate Danny Pooler is here to go ""On the Record.""Nice to see you, Danny.DANNY POOLER, FLORIDA DELEGATE WHO SUPPORTED BERNIE SANDERS: Hi, Greta. Thank you for having me.VAN SUSTEREN: OK, Danny. What do you think about Sanders and the email?POOLER: I think that the email leaks through WikiLeaks show that we have a long way to go before the Democratic Party can say that it truly represents the election of the American citizens.VAN SUSTEREN: Are you mildly unhappy, furious, so-so? Doesn't bother you? How do you describe it?POOLER: I'm upset. I'm disappointed but I'm not surprised what we found through the email leak was something that Sanders' supporters have been saying through the primary season. There is obvious bias by the chairwoman.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. The chairwoman, were you there today at the breakfast?POOLER: I was.VAN SUSTEREN: Were you one of those who booed?POOLER: I stood up with my email sign and I stood there silently until I was approached by Hillary delegates. At that point, I did begin the chants that went out against her.VAN SUSTEREN: So you have a sign that says email. What was your point?POOLER: I was there to make a point, to show her we know what you have done. You shouldn't be here. You need to be out of the Democratic Party, because she does not represent the majority of Democrats. It's ridiculous that she still attended the breakfast and I wish she had not, because with her ouster, there was a great opportunity for the Democratic Party to unite.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. So you didn't start booing until the Clinton delegates did what?POOLER: They came up to us and they started shouting at us to sit down and to behave and basically fall in line.VAN SUSTEREN: And you thought what?POOLER: I thought it was quite rude. I'm elected official to this convention. I'm a delegate. I have a right as anyone to be at that delegate breakfast and express my point of view.VAN SUSTEREN: How did Representative Wasserman Schultz respond to this, the booing?POOLER: She continued. She had to pause a couple times because she couldn't get her words out. The cheers and boos were pretty overwhelming, I can assume. But she finished her speech and then she left. She left the breakfast.VAN SUSTEREN: So, she didn't stick around and shake hands and meet and greet?POOLER: No, she wasn't there until her speech was to be given, either.VAN SUSTEREN: What do you think Senator Sanders should say tonight?POOLER: I think Senator Sanders should speak to the entire Democratic Party and not just his delegates. He needs to express that she is sort of unity that the Democratic Party is currently pushing is not acceptable.And also, I think also speak out against corruption within the Democratic Party at all levels. It wasn't just Debbie Wasserman Schultz whose emails were exposed. There were plenty of employees there expressing anti-Semitic views. And I think all of them should be disciplined and exodus should occur.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. In despite of this, do you still intend to support the Democratic Party nominee, Secretary Clinton?POOLER: Of course. I will always support the Democratic nominee. Senator Bernie Sanders brought me into the Democratic Party. And I'm very proud to say that. I have already joined my local Democratic executive committee. And I'm prepared to work towards bettering the Democratic Party throughout my lifetime and making it more expressive.VAN SUSTEREN: If you could say one thing to congresswoman, former chairman of the DNC, I guess she is until the end of the week, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, what would you say to her?POOLER: Stay out of politics.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. There you go. Danny, thank you. Welcome to Philadelphia.POOLER: Thank you."

8	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/01/06/gingrich-trump-big-in-every-way-world-needs-someone-strong/	Gingrich: Trump big in every way, world needs someone strong	"This is a rush transcript from ""On the Record,"" January 6, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Now to campaign trail. The Iowa caucus, 26 days away. The New Hampshire primary, well, that's 34 days away.Former speaker of the House and 2012 GOP presidential candidate Newt Gingrich goes ON THE RECORD.Nice to see you, Mr. Speaker.NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Good to be here as always.VAN SUSTEREN: OK. So who is going to win Iowa?GINGRICH: Probably either Cruz or Trump.VAN SUSTEREN: What does Cruz have to do to pass Trump because Trump is winning in the polls in Iowa?GINGRICH: Well, I think Cruz is doing the right things. He's out on a bus. He's out there going to small town to small town. And this is a real test between the modern politics of tweeting, calling in to TV shows and the traditional politics of being out there, meeting people, in their local communities.You know, Trump is a phenomenon, whether he can get people to turn out, we don't know. There is a belief that Cruz probably has a better turnout mechanism. It's pretty clear the race in Iowa right now is those two guys.VAN SUSTEREN: Why is Trump a phenomenon? What is it about him?GINGRICH: Well, I'm doing a column this week on ""The Art of the Deal,"" the book he wrote back in the 80s, because I read it over Christmas and found it was very helpful.Trump here is very big in every way. I mean, he is big financially. He is big in his ideas. He is big in his aggressiveness. He's physically big. And I think that communicates to a country.If you are a typical American, you recently have seen the Saudis and Iranians going head-to-head. The world markets are falling for 3 straight days. The North Korean setting up a hydrogen weapon. You now have reports of various immigrants in Germany who are raping and molesting women.You know, all these things are going on around you and you think the world is losing its mind. I want somebody really strong. And in comes Donald. And Trump, he looks really strong. He may not be totally what they believe in, but he looks strong enough to try it out. And I think there is almost like Andrew Jackson, a very substantial part of the American people saying I would rather take a risk on him than on the current system continuing to decay.VAN SUSTEREN: All right, fast forward. Let's assume that he wins the GOP nomination. It's now August. Does the GOP establishment get behind him 100 percent?GINGRICH: Yes.VAN SUSTEREN: Yes, you think so?GINGRICH: Yes, because the alternative is Hillary and Bill Clinton.VAN SUSTEREN: And so you have no doubt in your mind that people won't just sort of stay home, the people that can --(CROSSTALK)GINGRICH: I think people -- when the race gets down to everything we're learning about Hillary Clinton; the degree to which she has used the State Department to take care of Bill; the amount of money that poured through with people doing business with her; the degree to which she has lied about virtually everything, the degree to which she had secrets on her emails; the degree to which she is lying about Benghazi.Take the total picture and think to yourself, do you really want this in the White House? And I think at least for our party and for our base, the answer is going to be overwhelmingly no. And the people are going to say whoever the Republican nominee is, I am for them.VAN SUSTEREN: Anybody but. But, of course, the -- a lot of people on the Democratic Party don't believe any of that and think that all the things that you just listed are sort of just the Republican attack on Secretary Clinton.GINGRICH: People have wilful belief in fantasies and that's one of them.VAN SUSTEREN: All right, New Hampshire. So New Hampshire, Donald Trump is doing pretty well there, but you got some of the second tier. You've got people like Governor Chris Christie. Governor Kasich both doing well there.GINGRICH: Well, this is one of the fascinating parts to this story. If you didn't have Trump and Cruz, I think you would have a much more open story. What I can't figure out is how do you get past both Trump and Cruz. So what you have is the layer below Rubio, Christie, Kasich, fighting each other to try to get to be number three. Not to try to be number two. To try to get to be number three. And I think that's a very interesting phenomenon.VAN SUSTEREN: You know, to Cruz, President Obama said he was a first term senator with no experience. Cruz get hit with that?GINGRICH: Sure he gets hit with it some. Rubio gets hit with it some.VAN SUSTEREN: And Rand Paul?GINGRICH: And, of course, Rand Paul. And, of course, you had, you know, Trump who hasn't even been a senator. So we want to talk about -- but this is a year where people are going, oh, I'm so glad you don't have any experience.I mean, I have never -- look, I have never seen anything like it in my life. I was talking to Rick Santorum a while ago and we had a long year together in a campaign in 2012. And I said, if I were running, I would not have a clue how to function in this environment, given what's going on.VAN SUSTEREN: I guess we can agree it's never dull. Not dull.Anyway, Mr. Speaker, thank you, sir.GINGRICH: Great to be with you."
