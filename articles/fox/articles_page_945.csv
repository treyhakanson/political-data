This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: But first, for more reaction, we bring in our panel tonight, from The Weekly Standard, Steve Hayes is with us, Fox News political analyst Juan Williams, and from the University of Virginia Center for Politics, Larry Sabato is with us.You know, as I look and listen to what they're reporting here tonight, Steve, I'm thinking, you know, Jack Kingston is a conservative, Perdue is a conservative. They're trying to make every race Tea Party versus establishment. I don't think it fits in every case, do you?STEPHEN HAYES, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: No. I think that's right. I think the Tea Party versus establishment meme that has been pushed by the mainstream media, while there's some truth to it, has been really overdone.If you go back and look at the debates, the Georgia Senate debates on the Republican side -- you know, I remember the third debate, which was back in February, you had Perdue basically open up with an opening statement in which he called for bold entitlement reform. Yes, he later stumbled on the question of revenues versus tax increases, but this is not somebody who is sort of an Arlen Specter or Castle type from Delaware. He's pretty conservative.HANNITY: Yes. Well, what do you think, Larry, as we look at the races here tonight? We had some mixed results. We had mixed results last week. The Tea Party candidate in Nebraska won. I would think everybody would agree they didn't want to have a situation like Todd Akin last time, and that was part of where some people were getting more involved in the primary process, right?LARRY SABATO, UNIV. OF VIRGINIA CENTER FOR POLITICS: Absolutely. And look, I think what you just said applies to the two most important races by far tonight. First Kentucky. The Democrats wanted to get a break in Kentucky. They wanted to get a break in Georgia. They didn't get a break in either one.They had hoped that Matt Bevin would either beat Senator Mitch McConnell or give him a real scare, thereby launching him weakly into the general election. Well, McConnell won handily, so he's in good shape in this deeply red state, where President Obama has about a 35 percent approval record.Now, in Georgia, yes, partly, it depends on how these two-runoff finalists conduct their campaigns. They could end up destroying one another, but I kind of doubt it.I think, again, the Democrats were hoping that Congressman Broun or Congressman Gingrey would get the nomination because they were expecting one or both of them to be another Todd Akin or a Richard Mourdock. Well, they didn't get it. Instead, they're going to get a more mainstream conservative in this red state, where President Obama is well below 50 percent popularity. There you go.HANNITY: Yes. And then -- and every Democratic candidate, Juan Williams, they have an issue of the polls. Look at the political poll that came out this week. The country is not buying into the Democratic agenda. They don't think things are getting better. They don't like ObamaCare. They don't think the debate on ObamaCare is over.JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX POLITICAL ANALYST: I don't think that's what the polls show. I think what the polls show is that...HANNITY: Well, 60 percent said that!WILLIAMS: Republicans -- Republicans are strongly positioned here to do very well in the mid-terms in large part because of who turns out. And right now, if you look at those polls that you're citing -- I look at them a little differently, Sean, but what's clear is that, in fact, it's Tea Party energy that has people who are the people who are most likely to turn out and vote in this election. And unless Democrats can counter that, you can expect a big night for the Republicans.I will say this, that as we look at these races individually, I think you get a different picture, and the picture is contrary to what I'm hearing from my colleagues on this panel, that the Tea Party really did get squashed. I mean, the only Tea Party victory you can talk about...HANNITY: You know, I'm having a hard time...(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: You said ""balanced."" It was that Sasse race in Nebraska. Other than that...HANNITY: Wait a minute!WILLIAMS: Other than that...HANNITY: Juan...(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: ... the Tea Party has been crushed...HANNITY: Juan! I'm from Georgia.WILLIAMS: ... crushed by the establishment Republicans tonight.HANNITY: Jack Kingston, who's in the runoff, has a 97 percent approval rating from the American Conservative Union!WILLIAMS: That hasn't mattered to Tea Party people in the past. They've seen him as a...HANNITY: You cannot...WILLIAMS: ... as an establishment conservative.HANNITY: You cannot honestly cast this battle tonight in Georgia as Tea Party versus establishment. I'll let Larry and Steve weigh in. What do you guys think? Steve?(CROSSTALK)SABATO: No, go ahead.HAYES: Your point on -- your point on Jack Kingston is a good one. I mean, he's been a pretty solid conservative. He may have done some more spending over the long course of his career than some Tea Party conservatives would like.But this is not somebody who, again, fits the profile of somebody like an Arlen Specter or the kinds of candidates that gave rise to the Tea Party in the first place in 2010. There you had Republicans -- you had Tea Party candidates challenging, you know, establishment Republicans, but really very moderate Republicans, who often voted with Democrats, whether you're talking about Arlen Specter or you're talking about Castle in Delaware or others.This is a totally different group. I mean, you know, Mitch McConnell's American Conservative Union rating is quite high. Kingston's is high. I mean, this is a very different group.HANNITY: Yes. Larry, we'll give you the last word tonight.SABATO: Well, there's a learning curve here for Republicans, whether they're Tea Party or mainstream. They realized that both the establishment and the Tea Party threw away some Senate candidacies in 2010 and 2012. They're looking for winners, people who can put together a majority coalition in November. So far, they have been finding those people.HANNITY: All right, guys. Good to see you all.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Hannity,"" August 5, 2013. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: While many of our public figures are landing themselves in hot water, questions are being raised about who our children should be looking up to. Now, with our nation's favorite pastime announcing multiple suspensions for players caught using performance-enhancing drugs, former heroes like A-Rod and Ryan Braun, are they no longer fit to be role models for your kids?In the world of politics, we definitely don't want anybody looking up to scandal-plagued mayoral candidate wannabe Anthony Weiner or former Governor of New York Eliot Spitzer or even San Diego mayor Bob Filner.So, who is left? Were all the heroes gone? Here with reaction to this widespread cultural decay, are radio TV talk show host, the Sean Compton Production, Billy Cunningham and Third Way co-founder, Matt Bennett. Guys, good to see you. Thanks for being here.MATT BENNETT, THIRD WAY CO-FOUNDER: Good to be here. Thanks, Sean.BILL CUNNINGHAM, TV AND RADIO HOST: Sean, good evening.HANNITY: Billy Cunningham, you're close friends with Pete Rose, one of the greatest players of all time, played with Johnny Bench.CUNNINGHAM: Yes.HANNITY: Now this today, what is your reaction, sir?CUNNINGHAM: You know, Sean Hannity, in the good old days when men were men, gay meant you were happy and AIDs was an appetite depressant, you get to look up to teachers now having sex with students, politicians now licking women's faces in San Diego. We had a Hollywood stars like John Wayne and others you could look up to, we had the Roman Catholic Church. Look at the scandal there.In fact, Lance Armstrong, who I thought was one of the greatest stories in American sporting history, has been found dirty and now is getting sued all over the place.I believe, Sean, and I think you would agree with me, that role models are those individuals you have dinner with. It's moms and dads and brothers and sisters and poppies and nannas, and aunts and uncles and that you can't look toward anyone for a role model except within your own family.HANNITY: I agree. But Billy Cunningham, I was a New York Mets fan growing up. I wanted to be Tom Seaver. Help me out. You're friends with Pete Rose. One of the greatest players ever.CUNNINGHAM: And there is no better man, he's a man's man and a woman's man. Pete Rose, Johnny Bench and others, Frank Robinson went to Pete for years and said, come clean, it's all going to be OK. Pete could not confront the truth, and A-Rod, I think is not confronting the truth.And let's face it, Dwight Goodman is probably one of your heroes. How did that work out, Sean?HANNITY: It didn't work out too good. The only question I have -- I want to see the details of the case. Matt, I want to know what happened. Why a 211-game suspension. The rules say, 50, 100. There has to be something beyond what we think happened to give that big of punishment. Your reaction?BENNETT: I think that's right, I was listening earlier, and I think it will be very interesting to hear what the details are. But you know, what? I agree with the guests you had on earlier. I think Johnny Bench is right. There are still a lot of heroes out there. Bryce Harper is a stand-up guy in Washington, he's doing a lot of things. All you have to do is look to A-Rod's left and you have got.HANNITY: Derek Jeter.BENNETT: Derek Jeter.HANNITY: Yes.BENNETT: Who -- I hate the Yankees personally, but Derek Jeter is a stand-up guy.HANNITY: That's your problem. You're Democrat and you hate the Yankees. That's two big problems. You got two big --BENNETT: Two strikes. I'll start with two strikes. But my kids, I have got kids, both boys 13 and 10, and they can look up to guys like Bryce Harper and Derek Jeter, I think there's still plenty of guys out there as Johnny was saying for them to look up to in sports and in politics, too.HANNITY: Well, look at the guys, look, Anthony Weiner. You got him. You can't look up to him, you can't look up to Eliot Spitzer, Jim McGreevy, Bob Filner. Those are Democratic -- you know, I don't hear Democrats, it's a war on women by your party?BENNETT: Oh, come on. This is a bipartisan problem. You got David Vitter, you got Mark Sanford, you got Duke Cunningham, there are plenty of guys on both sides of the aisle.And look, this isn't old problem. Half of Shakespeare is about how power corrupts and powerful men do bad things sometimes involving women.HANNITY: Yes.BENNETT: But -- it's not new. There are plenty of people I think even in politics, even in Washington, degraded town, debased, where there are plenty of role models.HANNITY: Maybe, I don't want to get too political. Didn't a lot of this change, though, Billy Cunningham with the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky, didn't it sort of lower the bar 10 notches lower?CUNNINGHAM: Sean Hannity, we look at the Eisenhower, even Kennedy despite all the revelations we didn't know about, but when Clinton turned the Oval Office into the oral office, that became a big problem. And now every politician from Anthony's wiener to the mayor of San Diego now wants to use Clinton as a role model, that I can brave this thing out, I can smear my opponents, give my girlfriend some benefits, pay off a few people.And Clinton stayed in office. I think when history is written, 1997 and1998 will be a watershed moment when Clinton got away with that, all hell has broken loose ever since. I blame Hillary and I blame Bill.BENNETT: Come on. Hell has been breaking loose for centuries, they've been doing this for centuries, it's just that we got a press that's chasing it a little bit more than they used to be. They've been doing this a long time.HANNITY: Well, you know the story, say it ain't so.CUNNINGHAM: Yes.HANNITY: I mean, these kids, they deserve better role models, and for those that have the public eye, I think ball players, whether they like it or not, they have got to admit that these kids are looking up to them, they're emulating them, they're buying their shirts, they're wearing their hats.BENNETT: No question.CUNNINGHAM: And Johnny Bench would have hit 65 homeruns in 1972. If Bench had Juice, which he never did, the greatest catcher of all time, he would have hit 65. And that's why A-Rod has got a problem. His numbers are fictitious.But I'm a lawyer, Sean Hannity. I want to see the evidence. I think you should get to 50 games. Past that I think might be heaping too much on A-Rod.HANNITY: I think he might actually win his appeal unless they've got something we don't know about. Well, time is going to tell. I think they should have released it today.All right, guys. Good to see you.BENNETT: Then the Yankees will have to pay him.HANNITY: Billy Cunningham -- my Yankees will be back next year. Bad injury year this year, all right?Good to see you both.Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2013 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
