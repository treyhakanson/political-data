I don't know about you, but when I watch football, I want to watch football. I don't want to watch someone's political agenda shoved down my throat, whether I'm in agreement with it or not.On Sunday, some St. Louis Rams players made a statement about Ferguson, coming onto the field with the, ""Hands up, don't shoot"" gesture. That ruins the game. It injects controversy into the game.Football should be football. If these players disagree and think it's appropriate to take positions at NFL games and public displays, well, where were they when former Baltimore Ravens' player Ray Rice knocked the living daylights out of his then-fiancee? They were silent then. Hmmm.Look, of course, NFL players have a right to express themselves. But my objection is where they do it. They could do it on a news show or write an op-ed or post on Facebook or even fire off a tweet, any place and any time, but not during an NFL game. That's the one time families gather in the stands or around televisions just to have fun.And it's not just the players. Remember when Bob Costas decided to lecture the nation on gun control in the middle of an NFL game? Why ruin football with politics and controversy? It's just a game.Oh, one last thing -- go Packers! And that's my ""Off the Record"" comment tonight."	[]	[]
