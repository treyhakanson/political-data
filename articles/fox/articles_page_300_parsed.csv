'Special Report' Panel on Race for Democratic Presidential Nomination, Role of Religion in Politics

"	"This is a rush transcript of ""Special Report With Brit Hume"" from December 17, 2007. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN HILLARY CLINTON, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Campaigns are like life. Some days you're good, some days you got some challenges. You have to get up the next day and overcome them. That's how I live my life. That's how I run my campaign.And I feel really, really good about where my campaign is.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRIT HUME, HO ST: Indeed she may -- may Hillary Clinton feel good about it -- but it has not been, at least in terms of her standing in the polls in a couple of key early states, the best couple of weeks she could have had.Some thoughts on all this now from Fred Barnes, executive editor of The Weekly Standard, Nina Easton, Washington bureau chief of Fortune Magazine and the syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer -- FOX News contributors all.Nina, it doesn't appear yet that anything that she has tried has broken the momentum that Barack Obama has shown in the opinion polls.NINA EASTON, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, FORTUNE MAGAZINE: Let me quote Barack Obama, who just recently in the past couple of days said, look, last month I was an idiot, and this month I'm a genius.I think there's a lot of this like lemming running to proclaim that Hillary Clinton is in freefall. She has always been in trouble in Iowa, that always been the case. And it's clear that she peaked in Iowa -- HUME: You mean it's always been a difficult state for her?EASTON: It has always been a difficult state for her.She peaked in Iowa and nationally, actually, in early November, right after she stumbled that debate in Philadelphia, where she was asked the question about should you grant illegal immigrants driver's licenses, as New York state was proposing.She stumbled on that, and it was an opportunity for Barack Obama to look like a big guy. He stood up to her, tough, and it raised his stature. Since then, of course, there have been these attacks against him from the Clinton campaign that have backfired. Yes, she is stumbling. Yes, the trajectory is that she has turned it down and he has turned it up. I still think there's a chance for her in Iowa, even though her husband calls it a miracle, which by the way, I think -- HUME: He said he is not low balling!EASTON: I think this is, once again, Bill Clinton's spin. Keep in mind, Bill Clinton lost Iowa, came in second in New Hampshire in '92, and then he was suddenly the comeback kid. So this guy knows about spin.And I think it's still all in play, and we shouldn't be writing off Hillary Clinton.FRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, WEEKLY STANDARD: I agree: she's not dead yet. But she is certainly heading in the wrong direction. And she acts desperate. Her husband acts desperate. Going on Charlie Rose and saying that --HUME: It would be a miracle if she won?BARNES: Well, it would be a miracle if she won, and Obama just doesn't the experience, he hasn't been around long enough.I think the Clintons believe that it's their turn, and who is this guy Obama coming along and trying to butt in? Doesn't he know? His turn will come. We'll let him have the next turn. But Hillary Clinton, Senator Clinton, it's her turn now -- I think that's what they believe.But, look, she has a base in the Democratic Party, one that's been there a while, that was built up by her husband, and she's inherited a lot of it. I agree with Nina that it's not as great in Iowa as it is in other states like New Hampshire.And if she loses in Iowa and comes back and wins New Hampshire -- she will probably lose in South Carolina -- she will still be in the race, and it will be a horse race between her and Barack Obama.So, I agree, we shouldn't be burying her yet.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: And, for sure, there will be another cycle in the campaign coverage, which will be her comeback. It is inevitable, and if it doesn't happen, we're going to make it happen because the press will want a story.But I think there's a fundamental problem that she has that explains her fall, and that is we saw on the front page of ""The New York Times"" today. Her staff is talking about the big theme has to be change, change, change, and she is a change agent. She used the word a dozen times in all of her appearances this morning on the shows.But what everybody understand is if you elect her, what you are electing is a Clinton restoration. It's a return to the '90's. You are going to get the same couple, except now it is going to be officially two presidents, with all the complications of this odd and strained marriage.You're electing a marriage, and you're going to have all of the complications that we read about today, about the struggles within his people in the campaign, her people in the campaign. Imagine how that's going to be occurring over and over again if they are in the Oval Office.The advantage Obama has is he's offering a change and a future that is a clean slate, and hers is a return is to the '90s, and the slate is not very clean.EASTON: And her stance with experience, though versus Obama, and I don't see what the problem is with her raising questions about Obama's lack of experience. It is when they draw a contrast between the candidates -- BARNES: It is like they just got out of high school, and it is ridiculous.And, look, when Hillary Clinton talks about 35 years of experience, a lot of that experience is just as a spectator of politics. Her husband, remember, was the governor. Her husband was the president. She may have done things like the healthcare plan, which was a huge disaster, but the rest of the time, that's not real experience.I liken it to going to a football game. If I went to a football game and watched the game, and I came out of the game and said, I watch the game and I come out of the game and said, well, I'm experienced at football, and that's sort of what she is doing. Look -- HUME: You're suggesting that she has been a fan of politics but not a player?BARNES: She is a spectator -- she is sort of a player, with no responsibility.EASTON: A spectator is not a person that came up with a healthcare plan that she was wildly criticized for and had to deal with all the fallout.BARNES: She blew it, too. She talks about fighting for 35 years for all these things. Compare that to McCain when he says he was fighting.HUME: That's a good point.Here is quick update, but the way, on that grapevine item we did from the ""New York Sun"" story about the Princeton student who alleged he had been beaten after coming out against the school distribution of condoms.""The Daily Princetonian"" now says that Francisco Nava, that's the guy, has admitted he made up the story and fabricated ex-mails threatening his life and those of other student and one professor.Nava reportedly confessed to police today. He has been released with no charges so far. The school says the investigation continues.Next up with our panel, the proper role for religion and politics -- is there one? If so, what is it? We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BARAK OBAMA, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am so grateful to be here today, giving all praise and honor to god. Look at the day that the lord has made.MIKE HUCKABEE, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: At this time of year, sometimes it's nice to pull aside from all of that and just remember that what really matters is the celebration of the birth of Christ, and being with our family and our friends.I hope that you and your family will have a magnificent Christmas season. And on behalf of all of us, god bless, and merry Christmas.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUME: Well that message from Mike Huckabee, where he said have a wonderful Christmas season, but it also took note of that fact that this is the celebration of the birth of Christ. It was not exactly a non- denominational season's greeting card in the form of a campaign commercial.And, of course, what you heard from Barack Obama certainly brought his faith front and center before the audience to whom he was speaking, I guess, in South Carolina.Charles Krauthammer, who is at my side here, has written of this campaign ""It is knee deep in religion."" And he says it is only going to get worse, ""but a certain kind of conservative is not content,"" he went on, ""to argue that a religious underpinning for a policy is not disqualifying. He insists, does this conservative, that it is uniquely qualifying. Indeed, that it confers some special status.""Charles, we will come to you about all this in a moment, but, first, what about this, Fred? Barack Obama is a man of faith. Mike Huckabee is a man of faith who went so far with his faith as to become a minister. Is it fair to accuse him of running improperly on his faith?BARNES: I think Mike Huckabee is. And we have seen him in a different -- I wouldn't object that much to his Christmas card ad, but his earlier ad was the one that starts out by saying my faith defines me. And then he is a Christian leader. And that is clearly a pitch for a vote for me because I'm a Christian.I think, beyond that, there's not much. I know Charles complains about one line in Mitt Romney's speech about his Mormon faith, but beyond that -- I have been out with Romney. He doesn't campaign on his faith. Other candidates don't.HUME: You think Huckabee does?BARNES: I think he does. But, you see, Barack Obama, it was Sunday, and he was in South Carolina, and, so far as I know, and I haven't been out with Barack Obama, but he's not campaigning on his faith.Look, there is a difference between running on your faith, saying vote for me because I'm a Christian, and someone who just mentions his faith from time to time, as George W. Bush did in 2000.EASTON: There is nothing new about invoking god in presidential elections. The rise of the Christian right in the Republican Party is what it is. It's fine. It is like saying I'm gun owner. It is a way to identify and to pander to voters.Let's go back to 1988. You had Pat Robertson, a televangelist, come in second in Iowa. Flash forward to 2000, and you have George Bush naming Jesus Christ as his favorite philosopher.This is -- what's different is that the Democrats have decided they wrote off, in a very narrow election in 2000, they wrote off voters who were religious because of their secular speak, the way they talked to voters. And so now you see Barack Obama and Harry Reid, actually, in the Senate trying to appeal to those voters. That's the difference.KRAUTHAMMER: I agree it is not new. It is very old, but I think Huckabee did go over the line in that ad by saying that as a Christian leader he was appealing suddenly to the many evangelicals who believe that Mormons are not Christians, and perhaps they're heretical, and thus he is a superior candidate. That's what's wrong.I think it's time that all the candidates started rendering unto Caesar. It is completely harmless, that Christmas message from Huckabee. That's fine. Or the invocation by Obama in South Carolina. But there's an implication that there is something special about being a minister or Christian or a believer -- HUME: But if there were ever a candidate who, seems to me by the way he has lived his life, made it either inevitable or, at least, appropriate that he should talk about his faith even, indeed, campaigned from it, it would be Huckabee.KRAUTHAMMER: But he is implying that there is something special about that that makes him uniquely specially qualified to be president.We've got a war on terror. We have difficulties in the economy. We have immigration issues. Religion is not the key. Being a minister is not an answer on those issues.Content and Programming Copyright 2007 FOX News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Transcription Copyright 2007 Voxant, Inc.

There is a time and place to make political points but you don't do it on the backs of innocent people who were killed in a rampage. But that's exactly what has happened this week.Yesterday, a memorial service was held in California for six Americans murdered by Elliot Rodger last Friday -- obviously a heart breaking situation. These young people did nothing to Mr. Rodger, the crazed killer.In addition to the dead, he hurt 13 other people. As ""Talking Points"" has stated, there is no way to stop mass murder, no way. Even in countries like Norway, which is very peaceful and has little gun intrusion, a psycho murdered 77 human beings a few years ago. If somebody wants to kill, they will find a way.But for some reason, crazy ideologues feel they need to exploit these situations. We begin with this woman, Brittney Cooper who teaches gender and Africana studies at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Miss Cooper is a far left loon writing articles that associate ""Duck Dynasty"" with racism that kind of thing.On the net Cooper writes quote ""How many times must troubled young white men engage in these terroristic acts that make public space unsafe for everyone before we admit that white male privilege kills?"" Unquote.White male privilege kills? That's just insane. These murders had nothing to do with white privilege. It was some young guy unhinged. He actually killed himself. Is that white privilege, too? Ms. Cooper conveniently overlooks that murder is color blind.In Chicago thousands of people, thousands have been murdered in the public space over the last few years. And 70 percent of the killers are black; 70 percent, Miss Cooper. So you, madam, are exploiting the Santa Barbara atrocity and trying to ramp up racial hatred to boot. And Rutgers puts that person in the classroom?And then there is Mark Potok from the Southern Poverty Law Center. He blames the killing on Internet sites where frustrated men vent about women.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) POTOK: There is whole world known as the manosphere of these sites. There are scores and scores of these sites if not hundreds of them. And the thing that is most prevalent and the thing that's most noticeable about them is they are often really extreme misogyny. But this is a world that in fact has produced a number of mass killers.(END VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: Misogyny being hatred of women. So an Internet site provokes Rodger into going berserk. We expect more from Mr. Potok than that. The harsh truth is we're living in a world where more and more people are becoming mentally ill. The reason for that, excuse me, is alienation -- families falling apart, pervasive technology that numbs human feelings and a culture that too often celebrates violence.Boundaries are broken down. But it has nothing to do with racism or bias against women. It has to do with individuals who are so sick they want to destroy other people as well as themselves. Sometimes those people can be helped, sometimes they can't be. Again no matter what society does, there will always be mass murder -- always.And that's ""The Memo."""	['Cooper']	[]

"This is a rush transcript from ""Hannity,"" January 26, 2012. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)SEAN HANNITY, HOST: We got to talk politics. Here we've had three states, one caucus, two primaries, three different outcomes, a wild, you know, rollercoaster ride in terms of the polls. What do you make of this year?DONALD TRUMP, TRUMP ORGANIZATION CEO: Nobody knows what to make, it's a mess, and it's a mess because the Republicans unfortunately are playing right into Obama's hands. I think. Now, you could say that if somebody were just going to win and run out the clock, which happened last time with a good guy named John McCain and for six months nobody talked to about him and then you had the election and it wasn't so good. You know, because he was taken out of the news. At least this way, Mitt and Newt are in the news all the time, 24/7.HANNITY: Right.TRUMP: And you know, the case can be made that maybe it's better that it's going on like this. Sarah Palin, who I think is fantastic, by the way. She made the case that, you know, let it keep going, let it keep going. So, you know, maybe it's not so wrong.HANNITY: Last time we spoke you said you were very close to endorsing. Are you close to endorsing?TRUMP: Yes, I mean, at some point I'm going to make an endorsement over the next period of time. And I'm watching it very closely. I want somebody that is going to win, I want somebody that I think can do a great job. But I will make an endorsement at sometime, yes.HANNITY: What do you view -- let's look at Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney. Give me just off the top of your head what you think are their bigger strengths, their weaknesses.TRUMP: Well, both good men. Both good people. I know them both and I have really gotten to know them both very well. I love what Newt is doing with respect to debates. I mean, he is just a natural debater. Like we were talking just a little while ago about natural golfers, some people are naturals, they just have an ability.HANNITY: I'm not and you are.TRUMP: Well, whatever. But, you know, there are some people in sports. Is he a natural born debater. I mean, he's really very good. Although, in the last debate he was very toned down. I don't know if that was on purpose or whatever. But I thought there were a lot of good opportunities he would have had. I think he wanted to tone down the rhetoric and maybe that's a good thing. But he's very, very good at that, I think he would do great against Obama in the debates. And it's a big plus because we know the importance of debates. You look at Nixon/Kennedy. I mean, Kennedy was never going to win. It was going to be a romp. And they debated and it was over. Kennedy won because he did well. Nixon didn't do so well. Learned a lot. He wore the wrong suit, looked gray.HANNITY: Didn't put makeup on. It's interesting, those who listened on radio thought Nixon had won that debate.TRUMP: I see. That's very interesting. Well, I can understand that. But that was a whole big thing. You don't wear gray suits when you are in the debates, you don't wear certain kind of ties. But he didn't look good. He was sweating. So, the debates play a very big presidential in terms of getting the presidential nomination. So, that's very strong.I really have gotten to know Mitt and I like him a lot. I wish he could come across like he does one-on-one. And you may say the same thing. He is a tremendous guy. Great guy. I also wish he would be a little bit more proud of his success. I mean, he has really become and he has, you know, he's done a great job. He has put a lot of people to work. As an example when he talks about Bain and Bain Capital, he always says well, I had some good ones, I had some bad ones. I weed the bad ones out. You don't have to mention, your opponents will mention the bad ones. You don't have to mention it. He should be proud of his success, he should be proud of the American dream.Hey, look, I published my financial statement.HANNITY: In your book.TRUMP: I published it, I don't care. I mean, I'm proud of it, I mean, I employ thousands and thousands of people. And I'm very proud of it. I actually put my financial statement in the book that I was going to do for government. I said, hey, it's ready, it's there. We took the summary pages, we put them in the book. And I'm very proud of the fact that, you know, I did a great job. I have done a great job. Lots of cash, very little debt, great net worth. And that's what the country needs.HANNITY: Do you think in that sense, he playing it too safe? He's playing not to lose, not playing to win and maybe Newt is a little bit more bold, but it's a riskier strategy?TRUMP: I think it's also a presentation. And I tell him, just go out there and present because they are stuttering, they're stammering. It's sort of like, you know, when we are talking about the tax returns, if you didn't see them -- and the tax returns look like they're fine. But if you didn't see the tax returns you would think there is almost like something wrong. What's wrong? Because it was so tentative. And I really think he is a terrific guy. I think he would do a very good job. I don't think people understand him. I don't think they know him. And he has got to get that across. He has got to somehow get that across.HANNITY: He's also, it seems that he is having a harder time getting the conservative base. You need a conservative base to get this nomination.TRUMP: You do.HANNITY: And Newt seems to energize him.TRUMP: I think Newt feels more comfortable. That doesn't mean he is better or anything else. But I think he feels more comfortable, perhaps, talking to you and talking to other people than Mitt. Mitt doesn't feel comfortable. And, yet, when you are with him one-on-one, great guy. And if that could come across a little bit more, I think he would do very well. And I think he is going to do very well.HANNITY: Are you concerned at all about the back and forth? I mean, it's really gotten ugly. You spent a lot of time in Florida. The ad wars are going on.TRUMP: It's unbelievable.HANNITY: It's all negative and it's all against each other, not bringing up Obama. It's back and forth I think on some pretty superfluous stuff.TRUMP: Right. Well, again, we're going to see what happens but it's going to be in the news for quite some time. Nobody is leaving this race very quickly. This is, you know, this was going to be over after Florida and now it looks like it could last for months, literally months and maybe even to the convention. So, that may be a good thing. We are going to see what happens.HANNITY: You said yesterday on your Twitter account that Ivanka, your daughter would want you to run for president still. So, is that question still out there? Have we not resolved this yet?TRUMP: Well, she actually said on her account and I thought that was great. You know what that shows? I have a daughter that loves me. A beautiful daughter and a wonderful daughter. One of the nicest people I've ever met, Ivanka. And she loves her father. So that's nice. I'm sure your family wants you to run --HANNITY: No, I would hope my kids would want me to -- everyone wants their kids --(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: -- to run for president.HANNITY: Well, I don't think everyone wants their father to run for president. It wouldn't be viable.(CROSSTALK)But are you still thinking about it? I mean, there is a movement to get an independent opening on all 50 states.TRUMP: Well, you saw, they did a poll recently, a couple of month, a month ago. And I was the number one choice in the poll to run as an independent. I was very impressed by that. But the truth is, until the ""Apprentice"" ends which is in May, mid-May, I'm not allowed to do anything because of some really unfair laws having to do with equal time. So, if you are on a show or if you have a show, especially a big show like the ""Apprentice,"" you are not allowed to.HANNITY: That's crazy.TRUMP: I think it's crazy. Obama can go on shows, he can do interviews, he can fly around on a 747 and laugh at how stupid everybody is as he sits with his wife and looks out the window and says, ""Baby, look where we are. This is great. Do you believe how stupid those people are? Look at us."" And he has done a lousy job as president.HANNITY: Yes, I agree.TRUMP: Now, there is no problem with that but if I have a show -- I have a show and I'm not allowed to do anything. So, I'm not allowed to do anything until mid-May, after that I'm a free agent.HANNITY: All right. But you are saying, you are likely to endorse soon. So, if you endorse.TRUMP: Yes. If I endorse and if that person loses, that's possible too. And then I can do whatever I want -- no, if I endorse somebody, I'm not going to be running against them.HANNITY: Against that person.TRUMP: I promise.HANNITY: What happened in South Carolina was really unique. Because you had these two big debates. Newt comes out. He has a battle with Juan Williams, John King, and all of a sudden it's almost a 30 point shift in a week.TRUMP: Unbelievable.HANNITY: Wins by a pretty large margin in South Carolina. So, debates have played a really big part in the nomination process. All right. How big is that going to factor in? In other words, somebody's ability to get in Obama's face, confront him, debate him, be forceful, because I would imagine if you were a candidate that's what you would do.TRUMP: I would love to debate Obama. I mean, you have so much material. I would love to debate Obama. I think that again, you know, you get back down who is going to do better in debates. Thus far, Newt has done really well in debates. And, you know, Romney has done very well in the debates.HANNITY: They have all gotten better.TRUMP: They have all gotten better. But I think they both do very well in the debates. But I would say again, Newt is a master at the debate. And I think he is a little bit more in your face and that's what we need.(END VIDEOTAPE)Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
