This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When you look at the way he has dealt with the Senate, where he goes in there, frankly, like a little bit of a maniac, you are never going to get things done that way. You can't walk into the Senate and scream and call people liars and not be able to cajole and get along with people. He will never get anything done, and that's the problem with ted.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Donald Trump talking about Ted Cruz. He will be standing next to Ted Cruz in the next Republican debate in Las Vegas. CNN has the lineup up there. And there you see just to his side Carson and Cruz. This as some new Iowa polls out show Cruz gaining ground. This is the Real Clear Politics average of all the recent polls, and you see it's essentially tied with Cruz and Trump. There is a Des Moines Register poll where Cruz is up by 10, a CNN poll where Trump is up. But there you see the average of the Iowa polls.Then you have this Monmouth poll, this is a national poll came out today. Look at this, Trump at 41 percent, 27 points above Cruz nationally. And then here is the RCP average nationally. These are all the polls. And there is Trump at 31 percent, Cruz, and Rubio. That's the poll wrap-up. We're back with the panel. What about this, Steve?STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Trump has a very large lead nationally. That's some very good analysis.Look, I think this was actually maybe an interesting moment yesterday over the past couple days when you had Trump taking on Ted Cruz ostensibly for comments that Cruz made at a private fundraiser that were later made public where Cruz criticized Trump. He suggested that he wouldn't be comfortable with Trump with his finger on the button with his finger with nuclear weapon.If Trump persists in attacking Ted Cruz tomorrow night, it will be a fascinating night, because Ted Cruz will have an obvious choice to make. He can either, as he has, try to stay above the fray and not go after Donald Trump, or he can engage. I think he would prefer it to stay above the fray, but it will look a little odd if Cruz is being attacked by Trump and doesn't counter, and also attacks Marco Rubio and other candidates. I think it makes it a very interesting evening tomorrow night.BAIER: And it will be interesting to see how that interaction happens. I will note that all the Trump folks are saying, why are you not focusing more on the Monmouth poll that shows him at 41 percent? Recently Trump said, quote, ""What the hell is Monmouth? I only like the polls that treat me well."" So now --MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Maybe he thought it was woolly Monmouth.BAIER: I guess now it's turned.LIASSON: But I'm sure he will find a place in his heart for the Monmouth poll.BAIER: Now.LIASSON: I hate to throw cold water on this because I do think Donald Trump is the frontrunner of the Republican Party, but national polls in a primary don't really mean that much. We should really be looking at the state-by-state races.BAIER: It is eyebrow raising.LIASSON: It is eyebrow raising. But I think the takeaway is in a week where the Republican establishment for the first time last week turned against Trump for his proposal to ban temporarily Muslims from entering the United States, his support went up. That's the moral of the story.But I do think it's more important to look at the state-by-state polls, and that's why Iowa was so interesting because Cruz really has momentum. In terms of what is going to happen tomorrow night, there is no one who has thought about these debates more strategically than Ted Cruz. He knows what he is doing. And he is has used them very well. His response to the maniac comment that Trump made on FOX was to put a little clip of ""Maniac"" from ""Flash Dance,"" so he has responded with humor. He has tried not to attack Donald Trump frontally because, guess what, it doesn't work. So it will be really interesting to see what he does tomorrow night.BAIER: Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: When you are putting up a clip from ""Flash Dance,"" I think you have written off the millennial vote.(LAUGHTER)KRAUTHAMMER: On the Monmouth poll, I think Mara is exactly right. If this is not an outlier, and it probably is, but let's assume it's not, this is entirely a result of the Muslim exclusion remark. And it shows that the more outrageous he gets, the more he alienates. And this isn't only the Republican establishment. He was attacked in about 20 languages from around the world. He had to cancel -- a lot of which nobody speaks. He had to cancel a visit with the prime minister of Israel, which is sort of the gold standard for any candidate in having a visit, having a photo-op, as a result of that. This is -- I mean, this was the entire world. You had Paul Ryan, sort of the titular head of the Republicans in the head of the Congress who came out and very unusually spoke out against a candidate. If his numbers are rising as a result of that then the Republican electorate is in a place where I don't think any of us have imagined, and it could be divisive.BAIER: It will be fascinating tomorrow night. We will have complete coverage both before and after.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: This is my number one priority. I've got a lot of things on my plate. But my top priority is to defeat ISIL and to eliminate the scourge of this barbaric terrorism that has been taking place around the world.GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN (RET), FORMER NSA AND CIA DIRECTOR: That wasn't a mistake. That wasn't weakness. That was policy. His going to the ballpark and his spending less than a minute commenting on the attack, I actually believe in his heart of hearts the president's policy is that is not that big a deal. There are other things that are more important. And that was what he was messaging.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: A lot of people weighing in on the president's talk and reaction to the terror attacks in Brussels.Meantime new FOX polls out today on the issue of temporarily banning non- U.S. Muslims. This is all registered voters. And there you see favor, oppose. As you take a look at the break down by party identification, Republicans 69 percent, independents 55, Democrats 39.Meantime, the president has talked about his reaction in the past. Remember the criticism after Paris, his reaction to that. Let's take a look back at what he said today as well.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: Now, on our side, I think that there is a legitimate criticism of what I've been doing and our administration has been doing in the sense that we haven't on a regular basis, I think, described all the work that we've been doing for more than a year now to defeat ISIL.Groups like ISIL can't destroy us. They can't defeat us. They don't produce anything. They are not an existential threat to us.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Let's bring in our panel, David Catanese, senior politics writer for U.S. News and World Report, Fortune magazine's Nina Easton, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. OK, Nina, is there a disconnect here in the emotion, the tone, the tenor the president takes to how Americans feel about the terror threat?NINA EASTON, FORTUNE MAGAZINE: Yes. Americans feel deeply under threat. And not only that. by the way, this was not just an attack on Europe. Americans were injured in this attack and possibly targeted as we heard earlier in the show in this attack. These attacks came out of a radicalized community in Belgium that is very well planning an attack here.So for him to be so dismissive, it's almost like this is background noise, something we're going to have to get used to. There's a level of resignation. There's no show of strength, no show of command, no show of we are going to help Europe. We're going to keep the homeland safe. And to stand there, to be laughing. This is hours after this attack. This was the same day. And he's in the wave in baseball stadium laughing with Castro.BAIER: So his point, David, to ESPN was that you can't let the terror attack affect what you're doing, how you're doing it. But again, it seems like it's the image.DAVID CATANESE, U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT: Totally. And he said this again today, that leaving the baseball game, changing his schedule, coming back would be allowing the terrorists to win. That is his argument.But his comments and, frankly, Hillary Clinton's comments in tandem I think shows the Democratic Party is totally out of step and just out of bounds on this moment. I don't think they get it. Nobody was talking about relations with Cuba yesterday. He said this is an important part of his policy. Maybe it's an important part of his legacy. But the problem with I think Obama's comments and Hillary's is this is the new normal. These attacks will happen, and there is a sort of acceptance of it and that we're going to work with allies and we extend our hand. We're going to be resilient. But that's not good enough I don't think for the American people, and I think your polls indicate that.BAIER: This is Hillary Clinton today in what was billed as a big counterterrorism speech. And she tried to project strength.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It would also be a serious mistake to begin carpet bombing populated areas into oblivion. Proposing that doesn't make you sound tough. It makes you sound like you're in over your head. Slogans are not a strategy. Loose cannons tend to misfire. What America needs is strong, smart, steady leadership to wage and win this struggle.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Obviously referencing Ted Cruz and Donald Trump there.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Look, I think this is a semantic argument about what the word ""carpet"" means. Generally I think it refers to World War II, to Dresden, to the attack on Tokyo, where essentially you burn the city. That's not what we're talking about. What Cruz is talking about is comparing the gulf war where there are 1,100 sorties a day to today where there are about 15. Between those two numbers there's a huge gap. And it does show sort of a lassitude on the part of this president which you see in his statements.What he said in Argentina, this is a top priority. Everybody understands that's a farce. He doesn't believe a word of it. He says it by rote because he knows he's supposed to say it. But he has said in interviews. He has said it to his staff as reported in ""The Atlantic,"" more people die in falls in their bathtubs than die in terrorism.BAIER: He also said climate change is more important than ISIS.KRAUTHAMMER: Everything is more important than ISIS. He thinks it is the background noise of our time. He has said this openly in interviews. The reason everybody is exercises is because the media is hyping it. He said if it leads, it bleeds, so people are becoming afraid as a result of media ratings.But he is simply unwilling to face the fact that this is a serious threat to the west, to the United States. People are justly afraid. And that under his watch ISIL has gone from nonexistence to now having a presence in at least nine countries, having a safe haven, and having the capacity in one week an attack in west Africa in the Ivory Coast, an attack in Turkey, an attack in Brussels. That's a threat, and he does not believe it is.BAIER: On the flipside, Nina, you have Donald Trump who obviously is projecting strength. And whenever he talks about this, he hammers home that he is going to take out ISIS, even to the point where he says he would go beyond waterboarding. This is Donald Trump and the lawyer who was responsible in the Bush administration for keeping it in the lines.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We should go for waterboarding and we should go tougher than waterboarding.JOHN YOO, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: For us, waterboarding was the hardest question. And our view was it was basically right at the line of what was legal or illegal, but that you could not go beyond it. So for Trump to say he would go beyond waterboarding, I have no idea what he has in mind. But I think if he wants to do thing which are worse to people, I think it would violate federal law.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BAIER: Nina?EASTON: He's absolutely right. We've been tortured over that issue of waterboarding. We've drawn this fine line, and Donald Trump doesn't seem to care about where lines are drawn as we know watching him in the campaign. The other point I want to make though about both Donald Trump and Ted Cruz is their comments about taking on the Muslim community, whether it's banning Muslims or going after them in a slightly indiscriminate way with more police action, right?And the thing about Europe compared to the United States is because of our relationship with Muslim community, because of our political system and our security apparatus that works with Muslim leaders, we don't have the isolated, insulated communities that is dogging Europe right now. And there's one study that says most terrorists have been turned in by Muslim leaders, more have been turned in by Muslim leaders and government investigators to law enforcement. It is not in our national security to threaten to disrupt that relationship between local law enforcement, federal law enforcement, and the local Muslim community. And you have to keep that front and center.BAIER: Sure, but there have been accusations of radicalization happening in mosques.EASTON: And I don't want to downplay the fact that we have our own homegrown terrorists here and it is a problem, yes.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.
