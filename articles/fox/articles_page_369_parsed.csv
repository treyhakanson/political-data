This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT OBAMA: I don't expect 100 percent agreement from my Republican col leagues, but I do hope that we can all put politics aside and do the American people's business right now.REP. MIKE PENCE, R-IND.: As grateful as we are for the president's spirit, as I told him personally, House Democrats have completely ignored the president's call for bi partisan cooperation.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, HOST: President Obama up on Capitol Hill today talking to congressional Republicans about that $825 billion economic stimulus package. They call it a ""recovery and reinvestment package."" You just heard Republican Congressman Mike Pence expressing some disapproval of all of that.Some analytical observations about all of this from Fred Barnes, executive editor of The Weekly Standard, Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National Public Radio, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer -- FOX News contributors all.Fred, your thoughts about today's push by President Obama, and the fallout?FRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Smart by President Obama. He has talked about bipartisanship, and a part of it is at least listening to your partisan opposition. And going up to see Republicans -- he has invited them into the White House. It makes a lot of sense.Republicans, on the other hand, would like to drive a wedge between Obama and congressional Democrats. You can see that from the statement by Mike Pence.In other words, they want to use the promises and words of Obama against congressional Democrats, who certainly have been not bipartisan at all in their dealings with Republicans on this stimulus package.And then, I don't know, maybe something -- it will be up to Obama to decide if he's going to indulge in real bipartisanship. And he's not going to get 100 percent of Republicans. He used the figure -- he would like to get 80 percent of congress, which would mean half or 55 percent of Republicans, as well as all the Democrats.He can get them, but he has to give them something. He can't do it just by listening or talking or being nice. He has to give them something.And they haven't asked for much. You know, they want reduced or lower tax rates, this 20 percent exemption for small businesses, and so on out of their income -- I mean, are relatively small thing.But you have to give them something. You have to give them some serious, permanent tax cut. And if he does, a lot of Republicans will vote for it.MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: The White House does have to decide what level of Republican votes they need. They don't need any, actually. They will get this through both houses of Congress.But I do agree with Fred -- 99 percent of life is showing up, and he set a tone just by going up there. Tonight at the White House Rahm Emanuel is inviting another small group of Republicans to come and talk.The big question is what is he willing to do differently? I think the White House feels they already put in almost $300 billion of tax cuts in order to woo Republicans. They certainly aren't willing to change at least the refundable tax credit that some Republicans have such a big problem with.I think if there is going to be any give and take, it will be in the Senate, where they have higher hopes of getting more Republicans, and then in the conference. But the way Republicans are treating this president reminds me a little bit of Democrats and Ronald Reagan. He is personally popular. They don't want to take him on frontally. They are aiming all their fire at the House Democrats as if it is the House Democrats' bill and it's not Obama's. It is Obama's bill --BARNES: Except they wrote it!LIASSON: Yes, but he's guiding it, and if he didn't like something in it, as he didn't like the money for contraception, he would tell them to take it out.BAIER: Hold it out.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: There might be a tax cut that the Democrats or the president could throw in that would attract enough Republicans to give him a broad base of support, but I think that would be a mistake on the part of Republicans.I think they ought to oppose the bill on a matter of principle. And the principle is that this is the largest and the most rapidly run through stimulus spending package in American history, and a lot of it is simply not stimulus.The president has talked about having three-quarters of it spent in the first two years. Well, if it's not spent in the first two years, it's not stimulus. It shouldn't be in the bill. It should be in the regular appropriations.You've got almost half a billion for the study of climate change. Well, that could be a worthy cause, but it doesn't stimulate the economy or create jobs. It ought to be in the regular appropriation process, which has served us rather well over the 200 years.The stimulus is supposed to be a response to a national emergency. That's why it's a huge amount of money being quickly legislated on way ahead of any other schedule. So that has to be stimulus.I think Republicans ought to insist not that three-quarters happen in the first two years, but all of it. And, otherwise, vote no.BAIER: There is a lot of focus, Fred, on these congressional budget office projections about when the money would really impact the economy. When you look at the new estimates, really, the biggest impact is from the tax cuts at the front end, tax cuts that many Democrats opposed, right?BARNES: You mean the Republicans opposed? You mean the one that will go to -- the refundable tax credit that will go to people who don't pay any taxes at all, or at least any income taxes? Sure, that money can get out pretty quickly.The question is whether Obama wants to give Republicans something that's not a tax cut that's welfare, but something that will actually help him and the economy.Remember what happened in the New Deal. After four or five years of all the infrastructure and all the projects, which can put people to work, FDR cut back.And what happened? There was not a strong, robust private economy to step in and take over because he raised taxes on wealthy people and the attacked corporate America and so on, and didn't produce what Obama -- what is lacking in this bill.Obama needs, after a couple of years of stimulus, he needs a strong private economy. He's not going to get it from this bill.LIASSON: No, but this isn't the bill that is meant to do it --BARNES: Yes it is!LIASSON: The TARP is meant to do it, and the financial package to shore up the banks, and to do re-regulations, that is what is supposed to do it.BARNES: Then why do they call it a stimulus? It is supposed to stimulate the economy.BAIER: Last word here.The president gave his last formal TV interview to an Arabic channel based in Dubai. The panel will analyze what he said after the break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: What we need to understand is that there are extremist organizations, whether Muslim or any other faith, in the past that will use faith as a justification for violence. We cannot paint with a broad-brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faith's name.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: President Obama in his first formal television interview with Al-Arabiya, the channel based in Dubai. That question he was answering about the war on terror. And the phrase ""War on Terror"" and also ""Islamic fascism,"" he said the language we use matters. He struck a conciliatory tone throughout the interview.We're back with the panel. Charles, your thoughts on this interview?KRAUTHAMMER: Conciliatory, but also apologetic and defensive, I thought needlessly. We heard him say that he we shouldn't paint Islam with a broad-brush. Who does? That's a straw man. Did the Bush administration do so?Obama said ""My job is to communicate from the American people that the Muslim world is filled with extraordinary people who simply want to live their lives.""Well, where is the American heartland which is arguing otherwise?Look, if he wants -- dare say, ""I have Muslim relatives,"" as he did in the interview, ""and I lived in a Muslim land,"" as he did in the interview, ""and thus I have a special appreciation of Islam,"" that's OK.But somehow he is implying that somehow the Obama era is a break with the American past. Somehow it is undoing a disrespect of Islam that had somehow occurred under the previous administration.One week after 9/11, the president of the United States, George Bush, showed up in the Islamic center in Washington and declared Islam is peace and extended a hand of tolerance and generosity. There were no anti-Muslim riots in America. There was a spirit of generosity and tolerance.And, in fact, over the last 20 years, the United States has been engaged in exactly five military engagements in the world, two in the Balkans, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kuwait, all of them liberating Islamic peoples.We have no need to apologize. Extend a hand, yes, but to imply that there was a disrespect of Islam in the last administration, I think is unfair and fictional.BAIER: Mara, he was asked will the United States ever live with a nuclear Iran. He did not say, as he did on the campaign trail, that nuclear weapons would be unacceptable. He danced around a little bit and talked about the relationship with Iran. What about that answer?LIASSON: Look, I think that they are planning to have some kind of direct talks with Iran -- not right away, but eventually.And I think part of their think something that even if it doesn't achieve some spectacular results, they will at least be able to show our allies that we tried and we went the extra mile, and that, hopefully, that will get the Europeans on our side when we call for stricter sanctions, or whatever it is we're going to do after those talks fail.I think this was a smart move on the part of President Obama. It's his very first television interview after being elected president. It was to an Arabic channel. I think he said all the right things. He was trying to leverage his own Muslim heritage, his middle name, the fact he lived in a Muslim country.And I think as far as Charles' criticism, every president makes a straw man out of their predecessor in order to underline the change that they're bringing.And I don't know if this kind of interview in and of itself will change things, but it allows him to lay the groundwork for what he wants to go next.BARNES: I know whether it will change things or not -- it won't.If there is one rule of thumb that I have when you're dealing with the Middle East or with the Iranians, and particularly in regard to Arabic and Iranian, their approach to Israel, nice guys finish last.President Obama was trying to be nice with this ridiculous understatement about, you know, saying the Iranians, their building a nuclear weapon. They've threatened to liquidate Israel. They're supporting Hamas and Hezbollah. That's not helpful. That's not conducive to peace.I wonder what the Iranians think? I think the Iranians suppose, this guy, we're going to say, oh, we love this great new tone from Washington. They will pocket that. And what will Obama get in return? He'll get nothing.Content and Programming Copyright 2009 FOX News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

6	6	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2012/04/05/senate-races-tighten/	 Senate Races Tighten 	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" October 19, 2010. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.BRET BAIER, HOST OF ""SPECIAL REPORT"": The battle over the air waves over out in Washington state in a hot race as you look at the Real Clear Politics average of polls out there. You see incumbent Senator Patty Murray holding on to a four-point lead in the average over Republican Dino Rossi. A couple of issues taking center stage out there, including healthcare as the vice president and the president head out west.Let's bring in our panel, Steve Hayes, senior writer for the Weekly Standard, Nia-Malika Henderson of the Washington Post, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer.Steve, what about this race?STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: It's interesting. Boeing, as you saw from the ads, has become this huge issue in the race because of both the economy and the news ongoing potentially having to raise premiums, its health care premiums.BAIER: A letter went out to 90,000 employees. HAYES: It was 90,000 non-union employees, and it said basically your premiums are going to go up. And the letter cited in the very first paragraph of the new health care legislation. So while the company has started to backtrack a little bit, it was in there, it was in there from the beginning.And this exchange that you saw of Patty Murray saying not only did I read the bill, I helped write it. It took place in the debate last week, I though Senator Murray actually did very well in the debate overall but there was this line in a state where a recent Survey USA poll shows that voters want to repeal healthcare by a margin of 49 to 40.You've got her embracing healthcare saying not only did I read the legislation but I wrote it. And you've seen Dino Rossi come up quickly with an ad; I think the ad is absolutely devastating. BAIER: The White House is heading out that way. Vice President Biden out there today, the president heading out there again. He has been out there before. This is their firewall, I guess, on the Senate?NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, WASHINGTON POST: Very much so. Not only are those guys headed out there, Clinton is headed out there, and they are also deploying Michelle Obama. That tells how important the race is.One of the things they are thinking about the importance of women voters. The lead that Murray has is really about women. And so in many ways this whole debate about health care is a strength to her when it comes to women voters. You will see Michelle Obama and the president out there talking about healthcare and really kind of going after those voters so they feel like if they can get those woman energized and backing Murray out there they can hold on to the seat.BAIER: Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: What's so interesting is that health care is playing into the election. The Democrats had calculated what they wanted to do is have some of the goodies kick in before Election Day so at the end of September, for example, the preexisting condition denial option on children was abolished. Also the lifetimes caps on your costs, so you wouldn't be liable if they were extremely high.They thought that would be an advantage. What they didn't calculate is that is not going to affect a lot of people immediately or dramatically. But as a result of that insurers are going to have hugely increased costs and they're going to have to start announcing premium increases starting now.And that's why you are getting the Boeing story in Washington State, huge increase in Connecticut and other states. This is the season in which health care costs are determined for the following year. So instead of getting an advantage by scheduling the little goodies before Election Day, what they're going to get is a backlash against the increase in the costs which is inevitable if you increase the goodies. There is no free lunch anywhere. BAIER: Let's turn to some other Senate races.  Kentucky, it looks like it is closing there after a bitter ad campaign by Jack Conway the Democrat. There you see the Real Clear Politics Average of Polls, Rand Paul up by 3.3. Charles?KRAUTHAMMER: I think Conway has hurt himself. I think he really hit the dirt line, the line beyond which if you go it's not going to work.  There is a respected Democratic congressman in his own state in Kentucky who disavowed the attack that Conway had launched against Rand accusing him of being irreligious over a prank that occurred in college.It's almost as if there is one sort of nice sign of self-policing in this election. You go over the line and you're going to get hurt. I think Conway will be hurt going this far in his in his attacks.BAIER: Nia, let's go out to Nevada. The race, Sharron Angle against Harry Reid the Senate Majority leader, very tight race, essentially tied according to all the polls. And there see the average of polls. Some developments over recent days.HENDERSON: And you will see the president going out there too to rally young folks for Reid.One of the most interesting developments here I think is Angle's comments to the group of Latino students where she said that some of them look Asian. I think that might hurt her. That is a state where 14 percent of the electorate is Latino. So I think that might be a big gaffe for her.Looking at this from Harry Reid's perspective and the White House's perspective they are in some ways playing a rope-a-dope type of politics, they're hoping that essentially Angle will tire herself out and that  a lot of the money  will be spent and the longer this goes on she will make more gaffes and that will accrue to Reid's favor.BAIER: She does say that the country is a melting pot and that her Mexican-American grandchildren are evidence of that.HENDERSON: It was a more complete statement than that, but the sound bite for some Latinos at least might prove to be offensive.BAIER: OK, to Pennsylvania, where it also appears to be a race that is tightening. There is a new poll out PPP, that's a Democratic leaning organization that has Joe Sestak up by one point essentially erasing racing a nine point deficit. In fact the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is out with an email that is trying to raise money off this new poll.The Real Clear Politics average of polls still stands with Pat Toomey a lead of 6.3 percent according to the average of all the polls.  Steve, what about this PPP poll and what it means for this race.HAYES: This PPP poll has Washington abuzz, as you might imagine. There is a problem with the poll. The way that the poll is conducted assumes that Democratic turnout in this election, 2010, when everybody of all stripes has acknowledged there will be a huge Republican surge; this poll assumes that Democratic turnout will be greater this year than it was in 2008.So in 2008 they had 44 percent Democrats, 37 percent GOP, 18 percent independents actually turned out during this year, which brought President Obama to office, and President Obama won Pennsylvania. This year they are saying 48 percent of voters will be Democratic, 41 percent Republican, 18 percent independents. It is a good lesson on being skeptical of the polls and who's exactly being polled and what kind of turnout models they're using.BAIER: Do you think the White House has given up on the House?  Do you think despite what Robert Gibbs said that there is a sense in the White House that perhaps the House is going Republican?HAYES: Yes, I think that it's basic political reality.HENDERSON: I spoke to some people in the White House and they say they still see a way to hold on to the House. It is just difficult because field is so large. Almost 100 races are close.BAIER: On the table.KRAUTHAMMER: It's a matter of the triage of resources. Where are you going to send the big guns? If you are Democrat, you can hold the Senate. It requires the Republicans to draw an inside straight to get about six or seven of the toss ups.So in that case if you want to put all your resources in those states, for example, in Washington state as you showed her earlier, because if you flip one or two of those you retain the Senate, and that would be extremely important the next couple of years. Losing one House is one thing; losing two will be a catastrophe if you're a Democrat.BAIER: And 13 days starting tomorrow. We'll have a big election night. Stay tuned to Fox for everything politics.Up next, Iran gets involved in Afghanistan talks.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RICHARD HOLBROOKE, AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN ENVOY: We recognize that Iran with its long, almost completely open border with Afghanistan, with the huge drug problem which the Ambassador Yannucci mentioned, has a role to play in the peaceful settlement of this situation in Afghanistan.  So for the United States today there is no problem with their presence.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Two weeks ago, Afghan officials intercepted a shipment of Iranian weapons to the Taliban inside Afghanistan. But on Monday Iranian diplomats were at the table talking about Afghanistan at the invitation of the Obama administration.General David Petraeus briefed all of the diplomats about the transition from U.S. and NATO troops to afghan forces giving them all a briefing.Meantime, today, Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez visited Tehran.  It was his ninth trip in the past 18 months with his friend and ally Mahmoud Ahmadinejad talking about a number of different issues. What about all of this and the developments? We're back with the panel. Charles, first on the NATO invite for the Iranians at the table.KRAUTHAMMER: Well, to hear Holbrooke, how calm and collected he was, you would think it is the most natural and benign thing in the world having Iran at the table. In fact, if you live in the region and you see that it's a very important sign.Iran has defined itself for three decades by its anti- Americanism. All of its foreign affairs are aimed at -- affairs are aimed at weakening the United States and attacking the U.S. and its allies. The use of terror and proxies, it has been that way for a long time.Once you ask them in what it tells people in the region, meaning Afghanistan is the Americans are looking for an exit. It's not just as they have already heard the president is talking about today to withdraw that is item number one.Now, you get item number two, Iran at the table. Iran means us no good, ever anywhere. If it is at the table it means we are prepared to get a settlement in Afghanistan which is going to be a bad one or something in which we are willing to tolerate an essential enemy of the United States having an important role.  You can argue it is inevitable. It is only inevitable if America is going to leave and leave a mess behind. Iran, other elements and go home. I think that is how it is read in the region.BAIER: Nia, the administration is obviously portraying this as a positive sign that Iran agreed to be at the table and see it as a diplomatic win.HENDERSON: I think Charles is essentially right here. Everyone is eyeing the exit strategy and end date of drawdown of troops that is supposed to begin in July, and it feels like there is a lot at the table being legitimatized and stepping in.You also heard from the Taliban that they are eyeing this date too, and readying for the population for what this means. I think in many ways it seems to be an odd and troubling development.BAIER: Steve, we have done many reports about Iran's influence inside Afghanistan and actually directly linking to the killing of U.S. troops.HAYES: Directly. I mean the shipment of arms that you mentioned was only the latest and the largest. What has been happening in Iraq has been happening in Afghanistan for years. The first intelligence was in 2004, Iran aiding the Taliban and the insurgency there.I think really the problem is with two different people looking that the. One is Hamid Karzai. What does he say as he tries to figure out how should I behave and who should I listen to. He knows full well what Iran has been doing with respect to the insurgency.And the second is you have American soldiers intercepting these arm shipments from Iran into Afghanistan and then turn around and read in the front page of The New York Times that the United States that its leaders are sitting down with Iran who has a policy approved at the highest levels of the regime of killing American soldier is and affecting U.S. interests.  How is the soldier in Afghanistan looking at this news?BAIER: Charles, and about the visit by Chavez to Tehran, the significance there. His ninth but he goes from Tehran to Moscow to talk about a nuclear deal. KRAUTHAMMER: There are two segments of anti-Americanism in the world. Iran with Hezbollah and Hamas and its other elements. In Latin America, it is the Chavez, of course, with Nicaragua and the other smaller allies.You have the joining of these two elements. They are not an existential threat but on the sidelines encouraging them and helping them in some ways in always China and Russia. Actually, Turkey has joined with Iran and the others in that region.So it shows you the rise of the opposition elements and the symbolism of Chavez and the president of Iran are, of course, the most intense in their hatred of the United States and opposition to all of our policies.BAIER: Quickly, Nia, do you sense any urgency on the Iranian issue at the White House?HENDERSON: I think he is they are still talking about sanctions.  I think this is troubling for them since Iran seems to be a doubling down on their nuclear ambitions. We will have to wait and see in the next couple of days what we see out of the White House on this one.BAIER: Steve?HAYES: If they are sitting down with the Iranian leadership giving them briefings about what we're doing militarily, it doesn't seem to me that they are interested in mending it.Content and Programming Copyright 2010 Fox News Network, LLC.

"Now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine:Reading Between the HeadlinesPBS correspondent Ray Suarez says what he calls ""pseudo controversies"" about Barack Obama's background are symbols for a ""racial calculus"" prevalent in U.S. politics.Suarez said during an appearance in Michigan that opinions about Obama's inexperience, his childhood in Indonesia and the debunked rumors that he is a Muslim are stand-ins for something his detractors cannot admit: ""Religion has become a proxy for race,"" he said.Characterizing Obama as a Muslim ""is a way to confer otherness on him for those people who are uncomfortable saying they're against him because he's black,"" Suarez added.The Grand Rapids Press also reports Suarez said Republicans are leaving it to vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin to ""pile on the doubt"" about Obama's religion. However, Palin has never made a reference to the false rumors that Obama is anything but a Christian.Online ChatterDocuments have surfaced suggesting that Obama was a member of the socialist New Party during his 1996 run for the Illinois Senate. The New Party was an offshoot of the Democratic Socialists Party of America, or DSA. The Power Line blog links to several Internet pages supporting the claim.A Progressive Populist article in November of 1996 said, ""New Party member Barack Obama was uncontested for a State Senate seat from Chicago.""An archived page from the New Party's Web site in October 1996 says, ""Three N.P. members won Democratic primaries last spring and face off against Republican opponents on election day [including] Barack Obama.""A spokesman for the Obama campaign insists his candidate ran as a Democrat in that race and said, ""Don't believe the trash you read on the Internet.""Journeyed JournalistVeteran CBS correspondent Dean Reynolds -- who has covered many a race including both the Obama and McCain campaigns this year -- says Obama's campaign plane is ""cramped, uncomfortable and smells terrible most of the time.""Reynolds also writes the Obama aides working with the media on the campaign plane are ""often overwhelmed, overworked and uninformed about where, when, why or how the candidate is moving about.""He says Obama's national headquarters in Chicago ""airily dismisses complaints from journalists"" asking why daily schedules cannot be printed or e-mailed early enough to enable adequate planning. Contrary to what you might expect, he says the McCain camp actually treats the media better.To Tell the TruthDespite his Republican and Libertarian rivals agreeing, the Democratic incumbent in Indiana's Ninth Congressional District is declining to say if he will jump onboard a proposal that would strap all three candidates to lie detectors during a debate.The proposal was put forth by Republican Party chairman of that district, Larry Shickles, who says, ""While this format may be unusual, I feel strongly that voters need to be able to make a clear decision without all the usual spin.""The district Democratic chairman calls the idea ""pretty bizarre.""-- FOX News Channel's Zachary Kenworthy contributed to this report."

"Now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine:Politics of FearA Republican Party internal fundraising document outlines an aggressive campaign focusing on fear of President Obama and comparisons to socialism.Politico obtained the 72-page document from a Democrat. It explains GOP fundraising logic as: ""What can you sell when you do not have the White House -- the House -- or the Senate?"" The answer: -- ""Save the country from trending toward socialism!""There is also a slide titled ""The Evil Empire,"" that has a caricature of President Obama as The Joker, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as Cruella de Vil, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid as Scooby Doo.Republican Chairman Michael Steele calls the GOP document ""inappropriate"" and says he is dealing with it administratively.Must See TVFormer Alaska governor and current Fox News contributor Sarah Palin is meeting with television executives this week to pitch a program about her home state.Despite reports the project would be a reality show, it would actually be a documentary that focuses on the people, geography, and wildlife of Alaska. A source says it would have nothing to do with Palin's personal life or family.Palin is also working on a second book. Last fall's ""Going Rogue"" sold more than 2 million copies. Publisher Harper Collins says the next effort will be a, ""celebration of American virtues and strengths.""Movers and ShakersAnd finally, one unlucky Haitian family just can't catch a break. The Desarmes family lived through January's devastating earthquake, and then fled Port-au-Prince for Chile. They were there less than a month before Saturday's powerful quake struck that nation.One family member says: ""I left my country and came here because of an earthquake. And what was the point? It is the same thing. Does this happen to everyone?""On the positive side, all of the Desarmes' immediate family survived both quakes.-- FOX News Channel's Lanna Britt contributed to this report."

"Now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine:State of PlayThe arrest of Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich has put the spotlight back on Chicago's machine-style politics and history of corruption. But by one standard, Illinois is not even close to being the nation's most corrupt state. U.S.A. Today reports an analysis of Justice Department statistics reveals Illinois -- on a per capita basis -- ranks 18th in the number of federal corruption convictions from 1998 to 2007.North Dakota is number one with more than eight convictions per 100,000 people. Rounding out the top five are Louisiana, Alaska, Mississippi and Montana.But Don Morrison of the North Dakota Center for Public Good says people there are just better at rooting out corruption. ""Being a sparsely populated state, people know each other...to do what the governor of Illinois did is much more difficult here.""Coming CleanA Maryland company that cleaned the home of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff for about three years allegedly employed illegal aliens. The Washington Post reports at least five of those workers were undocumented even though the Secret Service routinely screened employee ID's. The company's owner James Reid has been fined more than $22,000. But he says that is excessive.Reid says, ""Our homeland security can't police their own home. How can they police our borders?
