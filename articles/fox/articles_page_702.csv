"This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" April 25, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle along with Juan Williams, Eric Bolling, Dana Perino and Brian Kilmeade. It is 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""It is the eve of another big election day. Donald Trump could sweep all five contests in the east tomorrow. He has a double digit lead in all of them. His rivals know they can no longer mathematically clinch the nomination before the convention. So they draw up a plan. Ted Cruz and John Kasich are coordinating their efforts of stop Trump in three upcoming states. The deal will keep Kasich on the sideline for Indiana's primary and Cruz out in Oregon and New Mexico. They spoke about their agreement on the trail today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It is big news today that John Kasich decided to pull out of Indiana to give us a head-to-head contest with Donald Trump. That is good for the men and women of Indiana -- it's good for the country.I understand that Donald will whine. That's what he does. Donald is a sore loser.JOHN KASICH, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The two of us are competing for -- to win a nomination and make sure that we can steward our resources so that we can stop Hillary Clinton. What Donald Trump needs to understand is he cannot beat Hillary Clinton.I'm not campaigning in Indiana and he's not campaigning in other states. That's all. That's all it is.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, guys. Thank you very much.KASICH: Not a big deal.(END VIDEO CLIPS)GUILFOYLE: As you can imagine, hmm, Trump has a few things to say about it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If you collude in business or if you collude in the stock market they put you in jail, but in politics, because it's a rigged system, because it's a corrupt enterprise. In politics you are allowed to collude, so they colluded. And actually, I was happy, because it shows how weak they are. It shows how pathetic they are.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Kasich, we call him ""One for 41."" I thought it was 38. He's won one race in 41 states, one. Now you look at Kasich, I don't think he knows what you know -- did you see him? He has a news conference all the time when he's eating. I have never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion. I watched Cruz this morning and he's all mixed up because he's losing so badly. And when he's under pressure, he is like a basket case.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Oh, my goodness. All right, we knew he was going to take too kindly to the collision, so to speak. But Eric, as we were listening to the, to the sound bites there, you heard kind of the different, the juxtaposition between how Senator Ted Cruz phrase these alliance and how Kasich said it.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: So three quick thoughts on this. The first one is, when I heard this is going on, it was like, man, why would they do this? They're playing right into what Donald Trump wants them to play. Trump has been saying all along, it's us versus them. It's outside -- I'm the outsider, they're corrupt, they're Washington, D.C., they're the (inaudible), they're the establishment. It's us against them. And then these two guys decide to get together and do exactly what Trump is saying D.C. is about. So that was the first point. I think this is going to end up playing in Trump's favor. Number two is, when I heard Cruz today say Kasich, quote, ""Kasich pulled out of Indiana,"" I thought oh, my god. When Kasich hears this, he's going to fire back. And the point, be sure you know who you are getting into bed with and make sure the other person it wants to get in bed with you too, otherwise, it could be ugly. Because now, if this thing doesn't it work -- if it does work, you're gonna end up having contested convention and everyone is going to say, wow, the republicans are divided. Let's see what happens. But if it doesn't work, you basically just handed the whole thing to Donald Trump. I didn't think that was, that was a sensible thing to do it. And the third point is, it's just the ugly -- for the outsiders, who are watching this thing from afar going, they're D.C. It says you know what, they do play by a different set of rules and we do on a day to day basis. And I think this is going to backfire for them -- for Cruz and Kasich.BRIAN KILMEADE, GUEST CO-HOST: He didn't know what the word collision meant.(LAUGHTER)KILMEADE: He was Hillary Clinton's version of wipe when Ed Henry asked Hillary Clinton, ""what is wiping? What does it mean? It's like physically wipe?"" Don't pretend like you don't know. He said, ""collusion, what are you talking about collusion?"" And then when asked this isn't a big deal, Ted Cruz says, ""It is a big deal."" He says it's a big deal. What do you say to voters, they don't want to vote for you? ""I've never told them to vote for me, I'm just gonna run it."" What is it? This is the worst I have all complain ever, because no one is on the same page. The same thing with Rubio tried to do this, earlier in the race. He had to say, ""You know Kasich has no shot, I'll pull out of here."" Kasich said, ""What are you talking about? I'll take my four voters and leave me alone."" It makes no sense as if they did not speak.BOLLING: Can I just throw a quick example in here? And Donald Trump points this out, in the business world, if you did this, you go to jail. If Coke and Pepsi decided to get together and have a deal to get to wipe out everyone else or another competitor that want to get in to the marketplace...KILMEADE: Right.BOLLING: ... they'll be broke up. They said no, he can't do that. Someone might get in trouble. But instead, they look at each other, they wink, they do a nod, and they both market themselves.KILMEADE: Baseball did it.BOLLING: And hope -- right. Exactly, it's the same thing.GUILFOYLE: Well, Kasich is more fair about it than Cruz.BOLLING: But the politics disappointed. They just show how ugly politics can be.GUILFOYLE: All right, Dana, so what did you think of the strategy over all in terms of -- and speaks specifically to the individual campaigns? Meaning, how do you think, you know, to benefit Cruz more than Kasich? Would have made this deal?DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Well there's a reason that this hasn't happened before now. It's just, it's really hard. And if you are a candidate that's been raising money, and you have supporters in those various states, you got delegate strategies. It's really hard to admit that you are not going to get to the 1237 and that you have, gonna have to try to work with another partner. I actually think that collusion is a terrible word for it. It's a strategy. And politics is a tough game, and they have a strategy -- it may not work. It does smack a little bit of desperation, but it may work. And so I think -- if I was Donald Trump, I -- of course, my advice would be totally different for him anyway, but take it -- consider me the Ainsley Hayes of Fox News. As you remember Ainsley Hayes?(CROSSTALK)PERINO: She's the lone republican who worked to the -- in the West Wing for the (inaudible) administration on the show. And they pulled her out of the basement very once in awhile and say...KILMEADE: Oh, OK.PERINO: ... what's really going on? What do you think? And it was only her opinion. So that's Ainsley of Fox News at the moment. If I were Donald Trump, I wouldn't even have addressed this, because what he did is revert back to exactly what everyone was praising him for not doing last week, which is being so presidential. First thing he had to do is attack them personally. That's what -- and he doesn't like to be handled. Like Manafort, those guys, were like here, try this. I mean's it is like -- but the people like me like this. And we like it. We are sitting here watching it laughing. I think if I were him, I would let my surrogates handle Cruz and Kasich who are so desperate down there, below them. So far below them, so far behind in the delegate count. And he could use today to attack Hillary Clinton and just show like; I'm going to be the general election candidate that you want me to be. I will show that I can beat her. That's a different way they got.(CROSSTALK)KILMEADE: Now it would be -- yeah, that would be (inaudible) because he know he has surrogates rather than his just family.PERINO: He has more.KILMEADE: Yeah.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: And then as of new national poll showing this defense, statistical margin of error, like three, four percentage point on...KILMEADE: But Kimberly, why not use it on Tuesday?(CROSSTALK)KILMEADE: Why not try to collude on Tuesday, tomorrow? Why just say, May 3rd, I'm really going to affect the race. And later on in Oregon, why not try to collude for tomorrow?GUILFOYLE: Right.KILMEADE: Because if you combine theoretically, Kasich's number --(CROSSTALK)KILMEADE: Ted Cruz's numbers...(CROSSTALK)KILMEADE: So wait --(CROSSTALK)KILMEADE: So wait --BOLLING: They probably will say then.KILMEADE: But tomorrow...GUILFOYLE: Yeah.KILMEADE: ... Trump is like a 25 to 30 point lead in some of the most --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: He can take all five.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: So that's the point. That's the big story here is that the numbers, the poll numbers are overwhelming for Trump tomorrow in five states -- I think it's a hundred plus 70...KILMEADE: Yeah, yeah.WILLIAMS: ... delegates in states. OK, so you wrap side up. What we really taking about are states like Indiana, because when you get to Indiana, then you are trying to block Trump from having the set -- 1372, whatever it is, 71. So the question --BOLLING: 1237.WILLIAMS: 1237. So the question then becomes, if you can stop Trump, and if you are Cruz, you think you have now, because over the weekend, Cruz is a must again, a number of people who promised to vote for him.KILMEADE: Second round.WILLIAMS: If you come to a second round of voting at the convention. So, but this is a smart move for Ted Cruz. For John Kasich, it's a desperation move. It's a move that says you know what? I think if we get to (inaudible), I can make the case that my numbers are sufficient to beat Hillary Clinton. Guess what, Ted Cruz doesn't have that. That's his play in this game. I think Donald Trump, as you know, as Dana was saying, he didn't need to respond, because at the moment, going into tomorrow, he's in great shape. But you notice he is now focused heavily on Indiana. And that's because that's --PERINO: He should be.KILMEADE: It was the day after New York.WILLIAMS: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. That's where they're focused. That's where Manafort, that's where this new team --KILMEADE: Right.WILLIAMS: Trump. But this idea that it helps Donald Trump --KILMEADE: True.WILLIAMS: No, it doesn't help. It might help him with people who already voting for him, it doesn't matter. What we are talking about now is can he unify the Republican Party, but it move beyond the base.BOLLING: You don't think that some people are gonna say, you know, I kind of like Ted Cruz, and I kind of like John Kasich.WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: But now that they are going to try to conspire or get together to try and take out the frontrunner --WILLIAMS: No, that's --BOLLING: Then maybe I'll move over there.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Nobody say. That's you know, I mean it might be an issue for people who already feel that, you know, it's to -- the Republican Party is to unlocks that -- betray them and all of that, but those people are already voting for Trump. They are not voting for --BOLLING: I don't know.WILLIAMS: I don't see --BOLLING: It's certainly an all in strategy for -- not Donald Trump, because he can still lose Indiana and still go forward and say, I'm still fighting here. But if he wins Indiana, I would say Cruz and Kasich put all the chips in and went forward if it doesn't work there.WILLIAMS: You don't understand. In other words --GUILFOYLE: They both need to drive at the contested convention.BOLLING: Right, right, the last speech.GUILFOYLE: That's the bottom line.BOLLING: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.KILMEADE: If you believe one poll, I mean, I think the Fox poll has Cruz within five. So can Kasich not -- cannot spending money, get him those five points.(CROSSTALK)KILMEADE: In theory, possibly. However, a lot of people who don't vote for Kasich might go, I go -- Trump is my number two.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: But I think, I think Kasich has like 19 percent in Indiana, right?KILMEADE: Yeah, it's could be 19 or 20.WILLIAMS: Right. OK.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: That's a lot. So that's a lot. If you --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: And remember --KILMEADE: I mean, John Kasich said --WILLIAMS: It's so many percent --KILMEADE: Why do I'm to have -- why do I have to leave?WILLIAMS: What do you mean?KILMEADE: He's out of the game. You know --WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, but it's a cooperation.GUILFOYLE: I agree.WILLIAMS: I think he's more like an alliance.GUILFOYLE: I thought that he should like given it up at all.WILLIAMS: I don't think it is collision, you guys -- I think that's Donald Trump's word because it suggest on illegality.BOLLING: But Juan --WILLIAMS: But it's more like a political alliance.BOLLING: He backed out of the contract so as...GUILFOYLE: Yes. So perception becomes reality --BOLLING: ... to let someone else wins so that you can -- he can defeat the other guy and then try to win over -- it's as reeks. It's massive like politics. We don't do that.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Imagine politics --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: I just -- I think you --BOLLING: You don't do it in bed.WILLIAMS: Of course you don't --BOLLING: You don't do it sports.WILLIAMS: Are you kidding?BOLLING: No. You don't loot? What you tell your kid -- to do with Survivor --KILMEADE: The game of Survivor.GUILFOYLE: All that --KILMEADE: Call that alliance.PERINO: Exactly.KILMEADE: Yeah, it's all that alliances.PERINO: I thought...GUILFOYLE: It's an alliance.PERINO: ... this was reality TV election.KILMEADE: Until you get to the finals, and you turn on your --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: But also you are gonna say --WILLIAMS: Did you guys watch ""Game of Thrones""? Hey, they do it all the time.GUILFOYLE: Like?WILLIAMS: Blood sport.KILMEADE: Oh, really?(LAUGHTER)KILMEADE: Fiction.GUILFOYLE: One more thought from Ainsley Hayes.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: I was just thinking that -- yeah, Ainsley Hayes. Cruz and Kasich, it's sort of like, let's say they have like family businesses and they are about to be taken over or has taken over by the corporation, the hedge funds coming in. And they say that they know that their dreams, their family business is over in the future. They want to stave it off as long as possible, so they're going to get together and try to make to make a bigger corporation so that they can go forward and not have the hospital takeover. It may not work. They may end up saying to say, sorry dad, we lost the business and then the Republican Party will have to --BOLLING: The only problem with --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: It's not a takeover by Trump or Cruz and Kasich. It's the voters. It's the customers of those corporations...PERINO: That's right. No, I'm saying --BOLLING: ... who have decided to go to the big company, instead of those --PERINO: Not all -- by not all of them.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: But not all of them -- exactly, Juan.BOLLING: OK. If you want to use that metric 90 something percent of the republicans don't want Kasich and 80 percent don't want Cruz. So --WILLIAMS: Yeah, of course?BOLLING: They carry on.WILLIAMS: Poor party.GUILFOYLE: I don't think John Kasich could have -- and he said it nice.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: John Kasich was (inaudible).(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: He's out here, I'm out there. Anyway, before we go, two programming notes, Trump and Cruz will both be on Hannity tonight. Tune in for the exclusive interviews at 10:00 p.m. eastern. And tomorrow night, got an extra hour of ""The Five."" At midnight, we're going to be live, breaking down the results of tomorrow's battle for the east. We hope you'll join us. We don't want o be lonely. Ahead, liberals love to demonize Charles Koch for donating money to the GOP, so they must have been shocked when they heard what the billionaire had to say about the presidential race this weekend. That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: A lot of democrats, like me, have taken issue with Donald Trump's foreign policy positions that includes banning Muslims from entering the United States. I never thought billionaire GOP Charles Koch would be in the club. He targeted both Trump and Cruz in his interview.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHARLES KOCH, CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF KOCH INDUSTRIES: That's antithetical our approach, but what was worse was this, we'll have them all register. That's reminiscent of Nazi Germany. I mean that's monstrous as I said at the time.JONATHAN KARL, ABC NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: And when you hear another top presidential candidate talking about making the sand glow and carpet bombing in the Middle East.KOCH: Well, that's got to be hyperbole. But I mean, that a candidate, whether they believe it or not, we think that appeals to the American people. This is frightening.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: And then he really blew my mind when he said this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KARL: So is it possible another Clinton could be better than another republican?KOCH: It's possible.KARL: You couldn't see yourself supporting Hillary Clinton, could you?KOCH: Well, I -- that -- her -- we would have to believe her actions would be quite different than her rhetoric. Let me put it that way.(LAUGHTER)KOCH: But on some of the republican candidates we would -- before we could support them, we'd have to believe their actions will be quite different than the rhetoric we've heard so far.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Wow. How does Hillary feel about Koch's sure support? She tweeted, quote, ""Not interested in endorsements from people who deny climate science and try to make it harder for people to vote."" Kimberly, what do you make of it?GUILFOYLE: Oh, she should be so lucky to get his support and his money. And you know what? This is not a surprise to me at all. No. Because if you know specifically where the Koch family puts their money and their contributions, they are largely like noninterventionists, you know, boarding on isolationist. They are not like hawkish in terms of military intervention and action by the United States. They love the country. They are patriots. They are quite charitable across the board, in terms of who they choose to support with a lot of different children's groups and hospitals. So, you know, they're very well-known and well-regarded philanthropists. So if you look at their record, this isn't inconsistent at all.WILLIAMS: Yeah, but I'm saying, they have typically supported republican causes, Eric.BOLLING: What I --WILLIAMS: And I think to myself, hey look all the...(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: ... republicans right now who are lining up against Trump. The (inaudible), these guys don't like Trump.BOLLING: Well, they don't. And that shouldn't blow -- should not have blown your mind when one of the Koch brothers said that. They are libertarians.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: So they're for wider, more open borders. That shouldn't blow your mind that they are for that. What should blow all of our minds is the way Hillary Clinton took what Charles Koch said right there, and turn it into an endorsement, which he was an endorsement of Hillary Clinton. It was simply, where would you be? Well, her actions would have to be a lot different than the rhetoric. That's not an endorsement.WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: But she -- hold on.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: He turned it into an endorsement. She called it an endorsement and said, oh by the way, I don't need his endorsement.WILLIAMS: Right. He didn't endorse her.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: He didn't -- well one of them, you know on the democratic side...GUILFOYLE: Well, then --WILLIAMS: ... people thought, maybe...GUILFOYLE: Free (inaudible) for climate change.BOLLING: Right.WILLIAMS: ... he was trying to harm her by appearing to support her, because her supporters...GUILFOYLE: How much she (inaudible)?WILLIAMS: ... are not going to line up with Charles Koch. I can tell you that. So Dana, part of this argument is well, maybe he's thinking the Republican Party is falling apart. Hillary is likely to win, so I better get in good with Hillary.GUILFOYLE: oh my, gosh.PERINO: I think, maybe he just expressing his views, which is that, I don't think I have anyone to vote for right now. It's -- I mean, that's what I got from that. And he's not alone. Make a lot of people feel that way. On the other thing, the Koch brothers are for free markets. I mean, that's really when it comes down to.GUILFOYLE: Yup.PERINO: So therefore, economic mobility, economic freedom. I think she handled that terribly. She could have -- why -- instead of turn it into something that was a negative, why don't you just say, look how bad the Republican Party is, and that they are now looking to me and just leave it at that, and not try to disavow them. That's more like add not subtract.WILLIAMS: All right. So what I heard Brian --GUILFOYLE: And say, and through climate change and to try and create favor. But that's --PERINO: And that to shows you how climate change and the Koch brothers, I mean, this is anti-religion to the democrats. They are --WILLIAMS: That's true.PERINO: They are -- they think the Koch brothers are evil. And remember Harry Reid said their names on the floor of the United States Senate --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: So many times to try to demonize them.WILLIAMS: Well -- so Brian, a part of this argument is, you know, if the republicans are falling apart -- you know, I really think Hillary Clinton is not as bad, because her husband when he was in office -- actually, according to Koch...KILMEADE: Right.WILLIAMS: ... limited government's growth much more so than George W. Bush.KILMEADE: Wow.(CROSSTALK)KILMEADE: Here's the thing. I kind of agree with the -- I got to agree with Eric when he says like -- that's not an endorsement. This was, tease wrong. I watched the show. Jonathan called it a great interview. That's fine. But the ABC chose to choose -- tease it by saying, could he be endorsing Hillary Clinton. You see how awkward he looked...WILLIAMS: Yeah.KILMEADE: ... when he came up with the question.WILLIAMS: Absolutely.KILMEADE: I don't really know. He's not a skilled politician. That he is not Bill Clinton, be able to (inaudible) any question, or Barack Obama for that. But I think that when you have Charles Koch, this guy is basically somebody who cares about the country, very patriotic. He also said in that interview that there's too many tax breaks for the rich. That it is planted (ph) for the rich.PERINO: Yup.KILMEADE: He also went out to say the system is skewed against those who need welfare.PERINO: Yup.KILMEADE: So he has said a whole bunch of things. So he's disappointed in the field right now. But I didn't -- when I watch that back, (inaudible), then I watch show. I didn't see any endorsement in Hillary Clinton. He said, ""I'll endorse her.""WILLIAMS: No, no --KILMEADE: She changes everything that she believes.WILLIAMS: No, no, wait --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Yes, it's going to have to be some change between the rhetoric and the reality.KILMEADE: Yes.WILLIAMS: But I must say, I came away from that (inaudible) --KILMEADE: Right.PERINO: Well, I think it's also clear --WILLIAMS: This guy is close to the Bernie Sanders than the Donald Trump.KILMEADE: Well, Juan, but I will say this so.WILLIAMS: All right.KILMEADE: If the rigged is only rich people don't want to get behind a republican; that might be good for the republican's image...WILLIAMS: Well --KILMEADE: Because they are looked at right or wrong as the party of the rich. So the rich running away, it might thaw (ph) some modernist to say, I'll take a second look.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, you're right.WILLIAMS: All right. Ahead, as Virginia's governor trying to swing his swing state toward Hillary Clinton in November by giving ex-cons the right to vote. Some of my friends at the table think so. We'll debate it, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: For the first time in more than a century, convicted felons will be allowed to vote in Virginia. Governor Terry McAuliffe restored rights to more than 200,000 ex-cons on Friday. That could be an unconstitutional overreach on outside the state legislature that points to political favoritism by the Clinton friendly democrat, right before the 2016 election. But the governor denies that and offers this advice to his critics.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TERRY MCAULIFFE, GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA: I would tell the republicans, quit complaining and go out and earn these folks right to vote for you. I would tell them to be very careful on how they frame this, very careful the rhetoric. They have an opportunity to go out and get these individual new voters to vote for them.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: McAuliffe likens his action to those of one of America's greatest president.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MCAULIFFE: Well, I stood in front of our capital and erased a hundred and fifteen years. I stood not 20 yards from Abraham Lincoln, met the freed slaves, a hundred and fifty-one years ago in April. It was the right thing to do, legally, and most importantly George, in one politics. It was the right thing to do morally.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: All right Eric, I don't think that the governor would be getting any or much blowback from folks if he had done this with the legislature, and if he had not included violent offenders. What do you think?BOLLING: Exactly. So the -- the timing was clearly aimed at when the legislature broke up and prior to the upcoming vote. Clearly, there was the reason to do that. And don't forget, Terry McAuliffe was a senior advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008 campaign. So they're very, very close. And Bill Clinton --PERINO: Worked at the White House.BOLLING: Bill Clinton -- and he worked at the White House as well. But the problem I think is what you just noted that it doesn't distinguish between a murder or rapist, and a guy who books a bet on the Ravens Redskins game. I mean, it's literally you can -- if the both can be felonies in Virginia, and it doesn't matter. So there's a blanket amnesty getting your voting rights back. Meanwhile, it's not like they are saying, you can't get your voting rights back, just petition state. That's what -- that's the process. It's been -- it's worked up until now.GUILFOYLE: From the books.BOLLING: Why now? What the sudden change?(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: But let me just say, quickly, that -- if that's right, petition the government, in this case the governor of Virginia...BOLLING: Right.WILLIAMS: That's the law.BOLLING: Right.WILLIAMS: He has this power.BOLLING: Right.WILLIAMS: So when people say, no, I don't think it's constitutional. It won't hold up? No, it does hold up. It's that he did it while the legislature was out. I thought your point was legit there.BOLLING: No, no. It's also that he have should distinguish between someone who has raped people and kill people.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: And someone who has done a lower level felony from --WILLIAMS: If they --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: They should be in jail. They should be in jail. I mean if, once they serve their sentence, once they --BOLLING: It doesn't matter what you did.WILLIAMS: I think --BOLLING: It doesn't matter.WILLIAMS: Well, I think that you paid your debt to society. And what we see here is the racial component. I think it's -- I think it's like one out of every five people in -- black people in Virginia is affected by this law. Half of the people who were banned right now are black, and nationally, you have to remember, nationally, 28 states have done just what Terry McAuliffe did in the last couple of years. I mean this is about disfranchisement. This is not about criminals.PERINO: Well, that -- so that he is going to play out in Virginia. There would be lawsuit, I'm sure. But Kimberly, I want to ask you about Terry McAuliffe advice where he says, ""The republicans -- instead of complaining about it, why you don't try to go out there and earn their vote. And I've been there might be some merit to that. What do you think?GUILFOYLE: Of course he can say that. But also, at the same time, this isn't race and intention. This is about justice. This is about victim's rights. This is about paying your debt and your dues, including restitution to victims of crime.If you want to vote, do not go out and commit violent crimes against people in the community. It's really that simple. You know, the ability to vote should be really, you know, sacrosanct, something that people respect, that they value, that they don't toss away, you know, to commit some crime and then look at the result.It's very disturbing to me, because there isn't any kind of precursor to say, if you owe victims of crimes, the people that you've got and people that you're murdered, et cetera, to the family, you don't even have to pay them back. You can still get your rights to them.WILLIAMS: But you realize, this was put in place, not to punish people for crimes. This was put in place back in 1902 to disenfranchise black voters.GUILFOYLE: Well, that's what he's saying, and that's what you're saying, but these are the laws on the books. And if it was such a good idea, so noble and valiant in its intention. Why did he circumvent the legislation and do it when they were out and go ahead and do it?WILLIAMS: Wait, you said noble and valiant?GUILFOYLE: If what he is doing is so noble and valiant, then why not embrace it and bring it to the full legislature and have them vote on it and really carefully analyze it?'WILLIAMS: Because right now -- I'll tell you very quickly, because I want to get Brian in. I'll tell you very quickly, which is most of these folks are black. I said half of them are black. The thought is from Republicans, they're likely Democratic voters, and it's not in our party's interest to have more Democratic voters.KILMEADE: Also, we should give them their Second Amendment rights back, too, give them guns, because let's just freaking forget. And also, I just -- I just think it's always a risk of comparing anything to Lincoln. What you're doing is an executive order. You compare it to what Lincoln did, welcoming the slaves in 18 -- in the 1860s. Please.PERINO: If you're going to compare -- if you want to compare yourself to Lincoln, let others do that.GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: You don't have to do that for yourself.GUILFOYLE: He's such a back patter, oh my God.KILMEADE: But both parties are for criminal justice reform, so they...PERINO: There is a bipartisan movement. And -- but I will say, on certain legal issues, Governor Kaine and Governor McDonald, one Democrat, one Republican, when they were governor, asked about the constitutionality of this...GUILFOYLE: But it wasn't constitutional. All right.PERINO: ... and they both said was not constitutional under the Virginia state law. But that's why I think it will continue.GUILFOYLE: Let the courts decide.PERINO: All right. President Obama announced today he'll be sending an extra 250 forces to Syria to fight ISIS. Will that be enough? Our boss (ph) and ""The Fastest Seven"" still coming your way, so stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KILMEADE: All right. Did you hear about this? The United States is expanding our military presence in Syria. President Obama today said he's sending up to 250 more special operators, mostly special operators to help local forces fight ISIS.I spoke with a former general of U.S. forces in Afghanistan earlier, Brigadier General Anthony Tatta [SIC] -- Tata, I should say. He says the move won't amount to direct action and called it three-dimensional chess.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEN. ANTHONY TATA (RET.), U.S. ARMY: Attacking ISIS is in our self- interest. Attacking Assad is in their self-interest, the rebels' self- interest. And so that's why you hear about four Syrian rebels trained after millions of dollars being spent. So we're essentially sending a Special Forces, Green Beret over there whose mission is to train and equip indigenous forces.(END VIDEO CLIP)KILMEADE: Who there aren't many of. Here's the White House with more on the mission.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BEN RHODES, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: The mission that they're being given is not to go into Syria and to engage the enemy, to engage ISIL. So they're not being sent there on a combat mission. They're being sent there on a mission to, again, be advising, assisting and supporting the forces that are fighting against ISIL on the ground.(END VIDEO CLIP)KILMEADE: So that's good news, America. We're not going to engage the enemy -- Dana.PERINO: That makes me feel so much better.KILMEADE: Fantastic.PERINO: They're finally getting back to the warfare that Petraeus and McChrystal used in Iraq during the surge, and it was used in Afghanistan in 2001 to defeat al Qaeda and the Taliban.I think that they should have been doing this in 2011. And had they done that, we wouldn't have to be sending back more special operators with less capability and no strategy. And it probably would have helped at least prevent or slowed down considerably the migrant crisis that is roiling most of Europe and threatens to hurt our country, too.KILMEADE: Which is hurting relations with everybody and infiltrating a lot of refugees; and the rhetoric is hot and heavy.The other problem is, Kimberly, is that 250 special operators not fighting ISIS with rebels that want to fight Assad...GUILFOYLE: yes.KILMEADE: ... not ISIS. Rebels don't want to fight ISIS unless ISIS engages them. The people we are supporting and training are trying to get rid of Assad. We don't even have an opinion on Assad right now. We're trying to kill ISIS.GUILFOYLE: But guess what? That's what it seems like we do. We're trying to actually train the people that want to take down Assad. What kind of mess is this? And I mean, 250 Special Forces, this is all because President Obama doesn't want to commit real ground forces, you know, to defeat ISIS.Actually, this is not moving the ball forward or down the court or whatever you want to say at all towards defeating ISIS. It really isn't. And it's shameful, because it's bad strategy. You know, militarily, politically. And don't expect anyone else in the least to kind of take up, you know, our back on this. Because that trip he just took was a complete disaster, I mean, unmitigated. So there's going to be no support from allies there to kind of push this effort forward. That's what I think...PERINO: It did come right after his trip to Saudi Arabia.KILMEADE: Right.GUILFOYLE: Which didn't go well.KILMEADE: And Eric, you're deep thinking?BOLLING: I'm thinking two things. No. 1, 250, what's that going to do? I hate to put people over there that could be put in harm's way when we don't even know the way the country, it's trifurcated right now. You have the anti-Assad forces. You have ISIS. And yet, the Assad forces, we've tried to get behind one or the other times, and then they turned out to be the bad guys.[17:40:05] Then Russia comes in. And it -- I've said this consistently: the best thing that we can do is support the Kurds, the Peshmerga on one side, support the Iraqis on the other side, and push everyone back into Syria. Let them figure that out.KILMEADE: Juan, the only thing...GUILFOYLE: They don't want to anger the Iranians. That's why he's not going to provide the Kurds with the weaponry that he's been promising to them for years.KILMEADE: Well, the one thing that we can agree on, that ISIS is our enemy. So take out ISIS. ISIS gives birth to the Islamic extremists who allow these other networks to flourish in Brussels, in Paris and San Bernardino. So wipe out the power before -- before this Plantar's wart infects the entire region.WILLIAMS: Sorry. Infection has already spread, doctor. I mean, this -- there are radical Islamists now in Africa, in Europe, I mean, you can go all across -- no, what it means is you have to do it strategically.Today, the president was meeting with the Italians, the French, the Germans in Germany. And what they're talking about is not only the fact that you're going to put in these additional forces. And it's not just 250. There's a large force now of Americans. I wouldn't say a combat force, but I'd say enough in terms of these advisors and so forth.They're on the ground, trying to figure out exactly how we can get people on the ground to act aggressively and effectively against ISIS and also used cyber security to try to take out...KILMEADE: There's nothing that said it's illogical, but it should have been done three years ago. Today, the front page of ""The New York times,"" ""We're going to start using cyber -- cyber-attacks.""GUILFOYLE: Right.KILMEADE: Really? Take your time. You should have been doing that three years ago. They've been tweeting out and recruiting. We've done nothing to stop it.WILLIAMS: No, I think you have to be careful about the civilians on the ground. They have pretty much given up on that. You see...PERINO: Ones that are left.WILLIAMS: Right, so that's the problem. And Dana's talking about, in terms of...BOLLING: So who are we supporting? Why not...GUILFOYLE: Yes, but you know what we're supporting? Like...BOLLING: Anti-Syrian forces? Are we supporting...WILLIAMS: Of course. We're not pro-Assad.BOLLING: Well, we've got to choose a problem, because some of those anti- Assad forces ended up being ISIS. They were totally against Assad.GUILFOYLE: It's actually -- it's actually...WILLIAMS: We're totally against Assad.GUILFOYLE: This is -- it's a huge problem. And then the Free Syrian Army forces, they're actually close to the allies with all the other territory, al Nazra and with al Qaeda. So that's who we're arming.KILMEADE: The last -- last thing that I was asked to do last week, no one wanted to do. You guys really were into this. Thanks so much.I've got to tell you what's straight ahead, on a lighter note: Rosario Dawson...GUILFOYLE: Right.KILMEADE: ... Beyonce Knowles and Tom Brady, coming up in the Fastest Seven. Got to take a wide shot.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Welcome back. Time for...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GRAPHIC: Fastest 7(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: ... ""The Fastest Seven Minutes on Television."" Three provocative stories, seven precipitous minutes, one principled host. First up, check out Sanders surrogate Rosario Dawson. Actress Rosario Dawson dropped this bombshell on the Hillary campaign.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROSARIO DAWSON, ACTRESS/BERNIE SANDERS SUPPORTER: We are really fending for ourselves right now. We are literally under attack for not just supporting the other candidates.Now, I'm with Monica Lewinsky with this. Bullying is bad. She's actually dedicated her life now to talking about that. And now, as a campaign strategy, we are being bullied. And somehow, that is OK and not being talked about with the richness that it needs to.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: I'm with you, Rosario. Bullying is bad. Wasting no time, Senator Sanders pushed back. Just kidding: he doubled down.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Rosario is a great actress, and she's doing a great job for us. She's been a passionate fighter to see that we increase the voter turnout. Our job right now is to contrast our views compared to secretary Clinton. That's what a campaign is about.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: So what do you think, Dana? Did Sanders do the right thing there?PERINO: He's trying to win. So we were talking earlier, like their strategy and, you know, they're colluding on the Democratic side to figure out what the best language to use. You bring up Hillary Clinton -- or, I'm sorry, Monica Lewinsky and you're a Democrat, that's like those are fighting words.I actually don't think that most of the young people that are voting for Bernie Sanders, most of them, were they born when the Monica Lewinsky thing happened? Maybe they were toddlers.They've already -- Democrats have pretty much factored in Monica Lewinsky and decided it doesn't matter. I don't know if it was worthwhile.BOLLING: What do you think?GUILFOYLE: I thought that that was very brave and passionate. You know, what she has to say is a very nice woman. I've met her before and in San Francisco. Look, she said what she believes in. She doesn't try and do what's most popular. So she's being authentic in her viewpoint.What I thought was even more interesting was that Bernie Sanders backed her up and he didn't, like, you know, throw her under the bus. That was kind of refreshing.BOLLING: Interesting, Juan. Because I mean, the path to Sanders being the candidate is unlikely. So this is all, like, positioning going forward for him. Is that the right position for him?WILLIAMS: No. But, I mean, I'm trying to think, what is the point? If she's trying to skewer Hillary Clinton by bringing up Monica Lewinsky, that was awkward and ineffective. So what is she trying to do? She says it's about bullying, but it, you know, comes across to me as patently absurd. She's really trying to bring up Monica Lewinsky. So how does that help Bernie Sanders? How does that somehow hurt Hillary Clinton?I see how it hurts Hillary. I'm not sure if it helps Bernie.KILMEADE: I think you guys are looking too deep into this. The bottom line is, Sanders people are getting pushed to get out. And she is on next, so she can call up Bernie Sanders, get him on the phone tomorrow. She's Rosario Dawson, a very successful, famous actress. And she feels it. And she's -- she said to her, so this is a line in the sand. We worked truly hard. We've already defied the odds. I'm not going to be pushed out. Give me a microphone. That's where everyone was going.PERINO: They're like those dogs that don't want to go to the bath. They're, like, holding onto the walls, ""I'm not going.""(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: It's painful for them to do. Just go in. Just go in.All right. Beyonce revealed her much-anticipated new album this weekend with a world premier HBO special, for ""Lemonade.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BEYONCE, SINGER (SINGING): You don't love me like I love you. They don't love you like I love you. They don't love you like I love you. You see there's no other man above you. What a way to treat the girl that loves you. They don't love you like I love you. Slow down. They don't love you like I love you.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right. Real quick around. K.G.GUILFOYLE: I didn't even think that sounds like her. I guess it was her, because I saw her moving around, and where was she? Is that Cuba? Like what's happening?BOLLING: World premiere, HBO special.WILLIAMS: Well, the way that she puts out music is setting the trend. I mean, she breaks barriers with this stuff.I must say, the gossip about it is all about her relationship with her husband and whether or not they're having a little trouble. But to me, what was, you know, interesting about it was how deep and intimate and personal. And the idea that she's now saying, you go through stages of grieving over various things in life to young black women, and she wants to be the model.BOLLING: Dana.PERINO: She says -- I admire her very much in terms of an international superstar. As Juan was saying, the way that she rolled out this new album just shows that women are very creative and are at the top of their game in the music industry.KILMEADE: Have they ever heard of private counseling? She's cutting an HBO video. She's doing a video about infidelity, alleged infidelity with her famous husband?PERINO: Maybe it's not about him.KILMEADE: Isn't that embarrassing? The couple -- are they supposed to repair this?GUILFOYLE: A lot of property damage.KILMEADE: If anyone doesn't need album sales, she could just cut an album. People will buy it.BOLLING: Do you remember that infamous elevator video?PERINO: Yes.KILMEADE: Solange? Solange?BOLLING: Where her sister was smacking Jay-Z, allegedly -- allegedly over this possible infidelity with -- with another person. Let's leave it like that.I know. I must say. I'm going to get yelled at if I say a name.All right. Remember when this happened?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TOM BRADY, QUARTERBACK, NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS: You know, I didn't alter the ball in any way. I have a process I go through before every game, where I go in and I pick the balls that I want to -- the footballs I want to use for the game. When I picked those footballs out, at that point, you know, to me, they are perfect. I mean, I feel like I've always played within the rules. I would never do anything to break the rules.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right. Today, a federal appeals court overturned a district court ruling that erased Tom Brady's NFL-levied suspension. Therefore, Brady will likely sit out the first four days in the next season, unless of course, the courts overturn the overturned penalty that was overturned. Get it?PERINO: No.WILLIAMS: This is -- it's not about Tom Brady at this point. I mean, he - - I think he won, because he got to play.KILMEADE: No, he didn't.WILLIAMS: He got to play last year.KILMEADE: He's going to miss four games.WILLIAMS: No, no. Now. I'm saying last year, when they -- in the immediate aftermath. He got to play this season. Now it's about the rules.KILMEADE: The judge made the comment that we think not only he was complicit, that he was -- that he was not honest about it, wasn't cooperating with the investigation, 2-1. Three judge. The appeals court said what every person knew.Tom Brady knew about it. He didn't need to do it. He was looking for an edge. He dug deeper down. People lost their jobs because of that, and he destroyed his phone to stop the -- stop the trail.PERINO: I always thought that he should have -- if he would have helped the guys that lost their jobs, that it would have been more forgivable.WILLIAMS: Wow.BOLLING: Final thought, K.G. Wrap it up.GUILFOYLE: Should have dropped it like it's hot in the hot tub, that phone. Whoops.BOLLING: Leave it there. ""One More Thing,"" up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: All right. Well, it's time now for ""One More Thing,"" Dana. What do you have?PERINO: So last night, Greg Gutfeld and I went to Hershey, Pennsylvania, where we did a little show at the Hershey Theater with Flat Jasper, which was great. It was a lot of fun. Everybody there was wonderful. Thanks for coming out. Thanks for all the support from ""The Five."" We talked about everybody's books here at the table, talked about our books.But here's something funny that happened.GUILFOYLE: Very nice.PERINO: So right before the show, Gutfeld and I were getting ready to go out. And I went, and I said, ""Are you ready?""He goes, ""Hey, there's been a change. So, I'm going to go on for 30 minutes, and then you might come on for five. Is that OK?""And I thought it was funny; it was like a joke, he was cutting me out of the show. So I tweeted that. And everyone believed that he had actually cut me out of the show. He didn't. I actually got to perform, as well.KILMEADE: So damage control. Did a little damage control.PERINO: Trying to help him, because people were mad.BOLLING: You had a good time, though, right?PERINO: It was fun. We had a great...GUILFOYLE: Eric, you've got a big...BOLLING: I do. Big announcement. Andrea Tantaros, our colleague right here at FOX News, her book comes out tomorrow. You can buy it tomorrow. You can preorder it now, ""Tied Up in Knots."" And let me just read a couple of blurbs from it. ""Andrea explores how women have let guys off the hook in relationships, much to their own detriment. She exposes how we've become a nation now opposed to intimacy. And it's a wakeup call for society to remember what we all really want out of life, love and work.So congratulations, Andrea. Check out the book.KILMEADE: There was a great column in ""The New York Post"" about that this weekend.GUILFOYLE; Yes, she wrote a column in it. Yes.All righty. Spend some money people. Go buy the book.Eric, you then me, I guess, right?BOLLING: Yes.GUILFOYLE: OK. I was trying to read this.OK. So this is actually very -- for people who love the military like we do, this is very nice. So this is World War II dog tags found in a yard that were returned to a family. Can you imagine this?So in early April, brothers in law Eric Besau and Steve Scott were planting trees in Portland when they found these dog tags. Now, through online research and putting a little effort into it, they found out who they actually belonged to. And it was Mary Argianas, who was born in 1920 and passed away six years ago from colon cancer. So she was enlisted in the women's army, believe it or not. So they met up with the nephew, handed these back. And it was quite an emotional reunion with that. Very, very nice.WILLIAMS: All right. Well, it was a big, big weekend in Chicago for my son Tony, Antonio, and his bride-to-be, Erica. They had the bridal shower this weekend. There you see them opening gifts in Chicago. The wedding is Memorial Day. And so Erica's family -- there you see Jay and Gordon and Erica and the whole family lined up. Four girls. Erica is the oldest and Antonio and Erica with Delice, my wife, who went out for the big event. And she won. She won a teacup and a tea kettle at the bridal shower. So they had a great time. Thanks so much to Jay and Gordon for welcoming my son into their family.GUILFOYLE: Very nice.KILMEADE: Congratulations to you and your family, and congratulations to American Airlines for standing up and saying stuff we all know. The TSA is destroying America. They say they're understaffed. The lines are so long, 6,800 people missed their flights because the lines are over an hour long. If you've ever been to the airport, it's the most aggravating thing yet. The TSA says, ""What do you want? You cut our budget. We're down to 42,000 people. We've got to check in millions on a daily basis."" So nobody takes responsibility. We all miss our flights, we carry the bag.BOLLING: TSA are big fans of the show.GUILFOYLE: That's it. Set your DVRs.PERINO: It's not their fault.GUILFOYLE: ""Special Report"" is next. Thank you, TSA.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Eric Bolling and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""Two days away from the GOP primary in South Carolina and Donald Trump is still in the lead. According to a brand new Fox poll out today, Ted Cruz in second, Marco Rubio in third, but we'll see what happen on Saturday. Rubio just got the coveted endorsement from the state's republican Governor Nikki Haley; so that may shape things up there. And nationally, there are some conflicting polls about who is on top, a CBS survey shows Trump ahead, but in NBC/Wall Street Journal poll has Cruz at number one; more on that in a moment -- but first, breaking news today, Trump and the pope exchanging some fiery comments about one another. Here's Pope Francis this morning, taking issue with Trump's views on immigration.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POPE FRANCIS (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they maybe, and not building bridges is not Christian. This is not in the gospel. This man is not Christian if he said things like that.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Trump, quickly responded.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which is everyone knows is ISIS's ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president, because -- it's true.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: It's true. Because this would not have happened for a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful. I'm proud to be a Christian and as president, I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened, unlike what is happening now with our current president. No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man's religion or faith.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: I thought it was a pretty effective response by Trump. Interesting to me that unlike usual, when he is off-the-cuff, he was reading that statement, because he knew that. I think that there -- his team was like -- this is a really important answer. I thought it was actually fairly effective.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: I do -- yes. So --PERINO: But you must be sad.BOLLING: No, no --PERINO: The pope.BOLLING: No, I'm a catholic --PERINO: You go every day.BOLLING: I go every single day, except Saturday. I go Monday through Friday here in --PERINO: Oh, I didn't know that.BOLLING: Look, the pope is a global spiritual leader. So I didn't love to see him delving into local politics. And that's really what this is; a presidential election in the United States is local politics for the pope. So I'm not loving that. But again, he is the leader. And what he said was this, if -- he said, ""If this man says building walls is OK without building bridges -- now, I assume that means without being charitable on top of building the wall, I think that's what he meant. I'm not sure that the pope's message isn't being misinterpreted by a lot of people. I mean, I think you could say -- I think, I personally think you can build a wall and still be charitable, and still build a bridge as well. And maybe, he doesn't really understand the message at this point.PERINO: A few times, Juan, the pope has commented on politics and that is sort of like -- been like a discordant note, here in America, then they tried to clarify it. Maybe he deserves a little leeway on that. But if the pope had said something like, I'll all for the wall. Then everybody would say, great, I'm glad the one -- that the pope has decided to get involved in American politics. But a pope is a political figure of this, if you go back to John Paul II, of course on the Cold War Front.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Oh, I think, I think the pope is definitely a political figure. And I think in American politics, Catholicism has been a political issue going back to John F. Kennedy and, you know, Al Smith and all that. So I mean we know how difficult that can be. But I think the fact that he was in Juarez, and that he was on top of a -- basically, on top of the wall, was sending a message. And so that to me, was even bigger than what he had to say. He was sending a message about his stand on immigrants and immigration. He has spoken out of this frequently and so that --BOLLING: But not necessarily -- he was making a comment on the wall than generally.WILLIAMS: No. I think he was speaking about how people treat immigrants and how they can be demonized and the rest. And I think that's what he was speaking to in the Trump situation. Let me just quickly say, that in South Carolina, I was taken by polls to show today, Trump is doing very well among the evangelicals. He is winning. He is beating Cruz. He is beating Carson. So it's not as the people of faith somehow think, oh, Trump and his profane statements and his use of bad language, and now the wall and the pope. I don't think this is going to hurt Donald Trump.PERINO: Well, in fact, Kimberly, I was thinking that actually, the pope weighing in at this point could actually help Trump in the primary, maybe not the general. But it could actually help him in the republican primary.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Why do you think that? It's interesting.PERINO: Well, because it brings up the issue that he has been most aggressive about, which is, he's going to build a wall. And other people want border security, as well.GUILFOYLE: Sure.PERINO: I also questioned again, the like -- the logistics of actually building a wall, and people like, think about it in their brains. But yeah, that's why I think that.GUILFOYLE: Yeah --PERINO: What do you think? What you think?GUILFOYLE: Well, you know, I mean I think that -- I think it's a very good point. There are flipside of that is, when you look at the juxtaposition, you have the pope, you have Donald Trump. It's pretty remarkable that the pope came out and made that kind of statement. You know, as a catholic as well, it is a little bit disconcerting because I don't think in the bible teaches, you should not stand in judgment, you know, of another person to determine whether or not they have a spiritual or Christian nature. So I found it a little bit polarizing, confusing. Not what I, personally, would like to hear the pope say about anybody; Hillary Clinton or anyone else, because I really feel that the pontiff is above the political fray, and should be. Meaning, the head of the church should not step down to make those types of comments. That's what problematic to me.PERINO: Well, that's the first time that he's weigh in on politics, or at least --GUILFOYLE: You're right --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: This has been one of your topics for a while about -- el pope's (ph).GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: I think I was the first to raise the alarm about this activist pope. We all know that he wants the show on MSNBC, he's been working for that, because you know, that's what he likes. He likes to talk about politics and he's talked about politics a lot. Look, you got to compare them to how he reacts to other political situations issues (inaudible). For example, the implosion of Venezuela, which is a socialist utopia, currently, destroying itself. I think his response was to pray for peace. He didn't condemn any other leaders, including leaders that oppressed the protesters. Instead, you know, he said pray for peace. In this case, in an American situation, he is going after a non-violent candidate who has different views than him. In my view, I always have a problem with recasting any issue whether it's economic or it is political, as a religious one. And I know the pope is religious. However, you have to be able to argue your point persuasively without your answer key. Because I may not adhere to your answer key, to your bible or your Koran, it may not be for me. So therefore, you have to argue. If you're going to get into a political argument, you have to be able to argue position (ph) using reason and morality that is not attached to religion. And I include the pope in that. And I think -- look, this is an economic argument. This is about -- he is a very liberal to socialist, activist pope. This is where he was -- this is what he grew up in. He is Sanders. He is the Sanders pope. He's not the Trump pope.PERINO: . that I thought about today. And the other thing Kimberly --GUILFOYLE: True.PERINO: If I could mention, the other reason I think it helps Trump in the general.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: . it's because if you look at the demographic, Mitt Romney needed to win -- well, George W. Bush won about 45 percent of Latino voters that has gone from -- to like 27 percent, it's something like 19 percent. With Romney it's estimated that whoever the republican nominee needs to win 35 percent of Latino voters, at least 35 percent --GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: It's not 40 percent.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: So yeah, does this help the democrat and the general election if it is a Trump nominee or anything on immigration? It doesn't matter who the republican nominee is.GUTFELD: Can I --PERINO: Immigration will be an issue in the general election.GUTFELD: This is the problem, though. And -- I'm serious about this. I mean, this is -- the reason why the pope concerned me is that he criticized a system, a free market system that has reduced poverty, increased incomes and increase health all over the world. The more it spreads, the better the world gets. If western civilization and other parts of the world, Eastern Europe had listened to the kind of things that the pope liked, there would be more suffering, not less. He does not like the kinds of economic systems that of help the world.GUILFOYLE: I know.GUTFELD: That's what concerning. And I think that gets lost when he starts talking about, you know, when he's painting this as a nativist argument.WILLIAMS: You know what, I love your argument. Because I was ready to fly back at you and say, you know, the pope really is concerned about the poor.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: The people who have been disadvantage, dispossessed by the larger society. And then you said, but in fact, the pope opposes a system, capitalism that has.GUILFOYLE: It helps.WILLIAMS: . eradicated.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: . so much poverty.GUTFELD: Yes, that's my point.WILLIAMS: And I -- but I don't think that's a great point. But I would say, in response, I think he's not anti-catholic. I know you are going to shout at me, but I don't think he's anti-catholic. I think that he's opposed to the excesses of capitalism.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: And capitalism does have it.GUTFELD: I would be OK with that.GUILFOYLE: And instead, that people suffer.GUTFELD: . if he opposes the excesses of socialism, which he never has. I have seen --PERINO: Can we switch here? So I think something happened in South Carolina today that was like the opposite of strife. It was actually a moment that you kind of look for a moment like this on a campaign trail that mean something. It just happened today in South Carolina. Watch John Kasich with the young man in South Carolina today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)QUESTION: I wanted to let you know and let everyone else here know, why I'm supporting you and why that support is unwavering. And I don't want to get too emotional, but it's pretty serious, but it has a happy ending. Like over a year ago, a man who was like my second dad, he killed himself. And then a few months later, my parents got a divorce and then a few months later, my dad lost his job. But -- and I was in a really dark place for a long time. I was pretty depressed. But I found hope and I found it in the lord and my friends. And now I've found it in my presidential candidate that I support. And I would really appreciate one of those hugs you've been talking about.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: So it's John Kasich on the trail in South Carolina. Maybe not doing as well in the polls as he would like, but obviously reaching out and touching certain people.GUILFOYLE: Touching hearts and minds and having an impact on, you know somebody who has had a very difficult time in life and was able to share. I bet to that made other people feel good. And so OK, there are some people having tough times, and the fact that he really likes Kasich. I hear that Kasich is a very good hugger, too.PERINO: Yeah.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Very sweet.PERINO: A nice moment on the trail. This young man, actually -- at the beginning of that, he said he traveled from the University of Georgia and I apologized to everyone in South Carolina for that, and everybody laughed. You don't get a lot of moments like this on the trail.BOLLING: And Kasich was bringing that out. And then he said he's going to stay positive. He's been true to that, and that's really sweet. If you -- again, the circus we believe, we both watched the circus, when you see Kasich on the trail, it is not just for the camera, that's behind the scenes. That's the guy he is. I'm big a fan of John Kasich.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: . as a man, not certainly as the guy I want as the next president of the United States.WILLIAMS: I would say he is the liberal's choice among the republicans.GUTFELD: But he's been a great governor.WILLIAMS: Oh he's a terrific governor.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: . and a great guest on ""The Five"" I might add.PERINO: Yes, he is.WILLIAMS: I think he did very well here. I will say, I'm surprised, Dana, you haven't talked about all the fighting going on among republicans in South Carolina.PERINO: Well, because I ran out of time.WILLIAMS: Oh.PERINO: And the Kasich thing just happened and I wanted to add it. So, but you can watch the ""O'Reilly factor"" tonight because --BOLLING: Oh, you gonna hit that aren't we?PERINO: Eric Bolling has --BOLLING: With you.PERINO: With Cruz and Rubio.GUTFELD: I just can't -- I just want to bring up Joe Scarborough and Mika from last night in the Town Hall with Donald Trump. I watched that. And I'm telling you, it was like watching pair of married swingers in a hotel bar, trying to pick up a mark and bring her back to the hotel room.GUILFOYLE: Oh my God.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: I felt so bad with Donald Trump. Donald Trump was like -- they were sitting --GUILFOYLE: Oh my God.GUTFELD: They were sitting so close to him. And it was -- it was like a Town Hall in a closet, and (inaudible), and Donald Trump was like, yeah. And he was -- who's just --BOLLING: There was a great second. I was watching it this morning. They re- aired some of it at 8:37 a.m. --GUILFOYLE: My God.BOLLING: . Eastern Time this morning, they panned the audience.GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: There was guy who did this --(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Swear to God -- asleep, out cold.PERINO: But you won't be asleep tonight if you watch the O'Reilly Factor, Eric Bolling hosting. I will be on. We're going to talk about Rubio and Cruz.BOLLING: And that's going to be hot.PERINO: We're gonna fulfill your wish -- I almost called you John, Juan. All right, ahead, the democratic battle for Nevada. Hillary Clinton is trying to pull some hard strings with Latino voters with her new emotional immigration themed ad. Let's do that next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Great song. Hillary Clinton knows she needs to pull off a win this weekend in Nevada where she is in a virtual tie with Bernie Sanders. So she just put out an emotional piece to Latino voters there with this new immigration ad.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: . my parents, they have a letter of deportation. I'm scared for them because they have the deportation. I'm scared they are going to be deported.HILLARY CLINTON, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Come here (inaudible).(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I'm going to do everything I can so you don't have to be scared. And you don't have to worry about what happens to your mom, or your dad, or somebody else in your family. I feel really, really strongly, but you're being very brave. And you have to be brave for them too, because they want you to be happy, they want you to be successful, they don't want you to worry too much. Let me do all the worrying. I'll do all the worrying, is that a deal?(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Well, it would be understandable for Latinos to be frustrated with the Democratic Party on this issue. President Obama swore that he was going to get this done in his first year in office, and he did not.So Dana, you really like that little moment of --PERINO: I just, well --GUILFOYLE: . warm --PERINO: What I said was that I thought it was a very smart ad for her. In 2008, she won 64 percent of the minority vote in Nevada. She is at risk now of losing part of that to Bernie Sanders, because he has ignited a base there. One of the things that is different in 2008 to now, is that there is a lot more millennial voters on the table than there were before, because of the just now they're older, so now they're registering to vote. And on the deportation issue, and this is again, it goes back to what I was saying in the A block. And if you're a republican nominee, you have to win a minimum of 35 percent of the Hispanic vote. It is ads like that that you will face in the general election. And I -- so that's why I think -- yeah, she is really smart to try to tap into that because campaigns are about stories and emotion, and I think if you're in Nevada watching that, you would be persuaded if you're a democrat.GUILFOYLE: All right, what did you think of that ad, Eric?BOLLING: So -- OK, so the difference between that and the young guy in the A block with Kasich, is that I believe that was just a clip we found. So he stood up a bit.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: It wasn't an ad. Now, Hillary Clinton clearly had a moment with this young, a young girl in a campaign event. But then they cut it and made it a political ad. It just seems little -- it just seems a little cheap to me. And I'm not trying to be hypocritical here that it is OK for the republican to do, but not the democrat. If it were spontaneous, we put some -- we saw a clip somewhere, there's any -- do you see what happened with Hillary Clinton.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: . and the young Latina girl.PERINO: Right.BOLLING: . Latina. That it is different.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: If it were spontaneous --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Are you saying it was staged?BOLLING: No. no. no, not at all.WILLIAMS: And it wasn't staged.BOLLING: I will say that I would agree -- I'll consider them the same way if John Kasich, then in turned, takes what that moment that he had today, and makes it a political ad.WILLIAMS: Well, I think you're playing a game like politics. You use what you have on the table.BOLLING: What?WILLIAMS: And that was on the table. And I think she knocked it out of the park. Someone throws you that (inaudible) ball; swing, buddy, swing. And she knocked that one. She can use some ads. I think Bernie hit one out of the park in Iowa, with that America ad.PERINO: Yeah.WILLIAMS: I think that really pick up for Bernie. This will pick up for Hillary; quarter of the state, Latino. She's bringing in people like Dolores Huerta, who, you know, co-founded the farm workers, we would say like Chavez. She's making a big effort, she's got the union.PERINO: But she still --WILLIAMS: What's that?PERINO: Expect for her -- her leaders have been erased.WILLIAMS: That's what I was going to say. It was the incredible tension lead is --GUILFOYLE: Like the magic eraser.WILLIAMS: Even in a state where she's got the democratic establishment and Harry Reid said he is not playing, but he's playing. So let's ignore that. You see, she's got Harry Reid; she's got the union.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: And did she get the union? Did she get the --WILLIAMS: She got --PERINO: Not all of them.WILLIAMS: Not all of that.PERINO: Not yet.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Yeah, that's a big one.WILLIAMS: But she's got -- I think the structure of all the unions is behind --GUILFOYLE: Greg, you specialize in spontaneous video.GUTFELD: I think this was an effort to humanize her. The software that they have installed, worked. It's humanizing (inaudible) emotion. I'm a nice person software that you can get at Staples, right now. It's the Hillary special. Say what you will about Hillary, and it is getting kind of frightening that Bernie Sanders is closing in on her. Even though we have our problems with Hillary we have to remind ourselves that she didn't live in a shack with periodic electricity and sell -- right pornography for a living. She actually made a living. I don't think he ever got a paycheck until he was mayor.GUILFOYLE: More than 40.GUTFELD: Until he was 40. His engine of industry is envy, and a hatred for capitalism. It scares --PERINO: It's like it slipped that and put it in an ad.GUTFELD: It scares me that liberal America is putting forth a person who actually thinks what makes America special, or the free market system, is actually a destructive force. I mean, this guy was an agitator all the way to the end --GUILFOYLE: And by the way, a bad carpenter. Please --GUTFELD: And a very bad carpenter.GUILFOYLE: Bad carpenter.GUTFELD: You know what the pope would have something to say about that.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: You know what?(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: You know what so interesting to me is -- and that.GUILFOYLE: Call him up.WILLIAMS: . your reaction to Bernie, reminds me of listening to lefties talk about Trump. Because they can't believe that Trump --GUTFELD: He has a mirror.WILLIAMS: But it's an interesting mirror.GUTFELD: I think it's a mirror.WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUTFELD: It's a mirror -- that's true.PERINO: It's like, well, in that Town hall last night where there were reading -- it's like who is this --GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: But it was Mika Brzezinski MSNBC, and she said, ""Are they reading along?"" So it's like, ""Who is this remind you of?"" And she reads this whole thing. And Donald Trump says, ""Well, me."" It's like, oh no, that's Bernie Sanders.WILLIAMS: Oh my, gosh.GUTFELD: Do you know -- just add this thing about how their people saying, they're not playing the gender card. This time they're going to Sanders. If Sanders wasn't a left winger, they would play the gender card. If that was James Webb, they would play the gender card. So don't think that they're being noble by rejecting gender warfare. They're only doing it because they found someone more left-wing.PERINO: It will come back.GUTFELD: Yeah, it will come back. It will be like the zombie.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: I don't understand; no job. No job. Say he's 48 -- and Dana.GUTFELD: And he --GUILFOYLE: . and then he was like, what would you do with the food stamp situations? Like --GUTFELD: What are we doing all our lives? Why do we -- we could be president.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: We took (inaudible) in the basement.GUILFOYLE: It's not actually encouraging anybody to be, you know, self- starter --GUTFELD: You don't have to do anything, and you can still be president.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: That's the problem.PERINO: Hillary sure they might cut that for an ad.GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: Let see. Did you hear?GUTFELD: Call me Hillary.GUILFOYLE: OK, Hillary.Hollywood may be joining the fight against ISIS. Will Apple get on board? Not -- next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: On Tuesday, Secretary of State John Kerry met with Hollywood studio heads to hatch a plan to counter the ISIS narrative. It's a great idea if I don't say so myself, years ago:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Imagine if Hollywood channeled this energy into something else, like death cults currently killing thousands; not Twizzlers, but terror. Imagine what Hollywood could do to degrade, mock and marginalize the useless, lurid tools who flock to loser-magnets like ISIS. They could use special effects to scare these mad martyrs crapless.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: So much skinnier then.I agree with that fellow. Forever Hollywood has pumped out propaganda for president's pet causes from obesity to climate change, while ignoring the real threat to their total existence. And that threat is a suicide cult with a great story. They're hoards of marauders racing across the sand to a sex crazed apocalypse. Meanwhile, our creative minds in Hollywood often side with our critics, portraying our free market system as a greed-driven, power-mad evil. America is the only target left in which blaming the victim is actually cheered.So this could help and maybe other companies like, maybe Apple, could join the fight. Consider the contrary narrative we could supply. Is ISIS a real fighting force? Or are they more like these guys?(BEGIN 'KUNG POW' VIDEO CLIP)(screaming)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: And what of those 72 virgins you were promised? Who might they be?(BEGIN 'BABE' VIDEO CLIP)(bleating)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: They are sexy.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: And they keep you warm at night. Now this could work. This idea could work. But there is one problem: How do we know about this plan? Kerry tweeted it. Yes, he tweeted to the world about our plan to fight ISIS. What in God's name is he thinking? Isn't the whole point of propaganda to make the enemy think that it's real and not manufactured? Well done, John Kerry. Announce our intentions then wonder why our enemy is always one step ahead. Who does this remind you of?(BEGIN 'FRANKENSTEIN' VIDEO CLIP)(murmuring)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Anyway.GUILFOYLE: OK.PERINO: Anyway.GUTFELD: Anyway -- all right Dana --GUILFOYLE: All the sheep --GUTFELD: All the sheep. All the sheep in heaven wouldn't make me join ISIS.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Oh.GUTFELD: That should be a country music song. All the sheep in ISIS.GUILFOYLE: Terrible.GUTFELD: Anyway -- OK.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Do not make join ISIS.GUTFELD: . ISIS. There you go. That's the song. Larry Gatlin, start singing it.Dana, John Kerry has to tweet this wide to make himself look important.PERINO: Because he's getting to meet with Hollywood.GUTFELD: Yes. That's what it was about.PERINO: There's an entire office at the CIA and the Defense Department that is, like, set up to work with Hollywood, especially like on historic films. They make sure that the uniforms are correct, things like that. I think this is a great idea. I agree with you and yourself from several years ago.GUTFELD: Yes. My doppelganger.PERINO: I hope they make -- I hope they make my video of the underwear bomber blowing his ding-ding off.GUTFELD: His...GUILFOYLE: Wait, what's wrong with that end of the table? Honestly. I don't know what's happening.GUTFELD: That's good to know.GUILFOYLE: Ding-dong?GUTFELD: Terrorists -- terrorists have to know that that's what's going to happen to them. They'll be castrated.GUILFOYLE: The ding-dong.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: OK. Rough, rough talk.GUTFELD: What do you think of this?GUILFOYLE: Listen, this is no surprise for me. It is like a flood of ketchup in the brain. Like, quit it. You're not thinking. Why are you telling them everything we're doing? Like, stand down on your Twitter account. OK? You guys like to do that a lot. Right?This is -- I'm so frustrated, because that's making America weaker, not stronger. Why do you have to tell the bad guys what you're going to do next? You must not be serious about having an effective outcome if you're doing that.GUTFELD: Eric, it's because he was showing -- he was showing off.GUILFOYLE: To who?BOLLING: They don't know what they're doing. Hashtag diplomacy, meet with Hollywood producers to have, I guess, the narrative change about ISIS.By the way, are any one of them going to make an ISIS -- a negative ISIS movie, and would anyone go see that movie? I'm not really sure that's hugely...GUILFOYLE: Only ""South Park"" will do it.BOLLING: James Taylor singing, ""You've Got a Friend in Paris."" I mean, what are they doing? Why don't you kill them? How about just killing ISIS? Aptly point out, that would be better strategy than these ridiculous things.GUTFELD: Yes. I'm for propaganda. I think we need more -- we have propaganda on global warming, so we should have propaganda against ISIS. I just don't want to tell them, Juan, that we're doing it.GUILFOYLE: Well, you let them know about the sheep.WILLIAMS: I think the issue is are we doing it? I want to do it. I want the Hollywood people to get involved and understand that it is not somebody using you for that propaganda. This is about our best interests and our safety as Americans and get in the fight. We want that talent. We want that imagination and energy. Richard Stengel, who used to be the editor at Times, is at the State Department doing this kind of thing. Dana referred to what the CIA does. They do it, too. They've got to understand social media is a front in this war. You can't denigrate it and think it's just - - oh, it's a nice thing to do.I don't think it's about...GUILFOYLE: NO.WILLIAMS: Everybody knows. I think we need to do more of it. We need to take it serious.PERINO: They do it all the time, and they actually use real footage. Like when they behead a young man, because he's gay.BOLLING: Don't we do this, though?WILLIAMS: No, we don't do enough of it.GUILFOYLE: No, no.BOLLING: Look what happens when you do. You have the Chris Kyle movie. Then you have the ""13 Hours"" movie. And they get panned by various critics.WILLIAMS: No, no. That's because they get politicized by the right.GUILFOYLE: Act of valor.WILLIAMS: You know what? Let's cut down on the smoking or the kind of, you know, R-rated, X-rated -- they can do it and they can put this message into very popular movies.GUILFOYLE: I think they should just use special effects to show ISIS being completely humiliated.WILLIAMS: That's good.GUILFOYLE: Create fictional stuff and play it off as fact.PERINO: They hate the weaklings.GUILFOYLE: Or just have, like, gods come down and saying, ""What you're doing is bad, ISIS."" I don't know.BOLLING: A comedy?PERINO: Satire. They don't do satire very well.BOLLING: A Polish ISIS.GUTFELD: There's a movie called ""Four Lions,"" which Borat -- what's his face, Sacha Baron Cohen -- had, I think, was involved in.PERINO: And then were the two guys that did the -- they were here in America. They were Iranian, but they were working for, basically, Voice of America, and they were doing a satire against Iran. And they -- they actually -- they modeled it after ""The Daily Show,"" and they were very successful. And I don't think they're on the air anymore.WILLIAMS: We need more of them.GUTFELD: We've got to move on. All right. A lot of people want to know why President Obama is skipping Justice Scalia's funeral on Saturday. The White House defended the decision again today, and you're going to hear about that, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: The White House says President Obama will not attend Justice Anthony Scalia's funeral on Saturday. Vice President Biden will go. Instead, the president will pay his respects Friday at the Supreme Court, where Scalia's body will lie in repose. Here's Josh Earnest explaining why.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN: Obviously when the vice president travels someplace, his security footprint is at least a little bit lighter. We believe we have settled on an appropriate and respectful arrangement.There's so much rancor and politics and partisanship that we allow ourselves to get drawn into different corners to the extent some people want to use the funeral of a Supreme Court justice as some sort of political cudgel.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Meanwhile, today the president stirred up some controversy, meeting with some members of the Black Lives Matter movement at the White House. There are also lots of mixed feelings about his planned trip to communist Cuba next month, the first by a sitting U.S. president in nearly 90 years.Eric, what do you think?BOLLING: The security footprint is the reason why President Obama won't go...WILLIAMS: That's pretty laughable.BOLLING: ... won't go to Justice Scalia's funeral?The man just...GUILFOYLE: So rude.BOLLING: ... served the country honorably for 30 years. And President Obama has decided his security footprint would be too big so he's sending Joe Biden. That's laughable. There is a security footprint for Josh Earnest, I'm thinking, somewhere. We won't go there. Awful, terrible.Just look, how long could it possibly take? Two or three hours of his day? I mean, he spent five hours on the golf course minutes after announcing the beheading of an American a summer and a half ago. Remember that?WILLIAMS: Look, wait a second. Wait a second.BOLLING: His P.R. piece (ph) are really messing up.WILLIAMS: He's going Friday, right?BOLLING: How is the security foot print Friday?WILLIAMS: It's different. It's the Supreme Court where he's lying, you know.But let me just say, Dana, I think it's interesting that you see somebody like Scalia, and he's going to be tremendously honored. But somehow it becomes the political event all of a sudden.PERINO: OK, but it was just last week that President Obama went to Springfield, Illinois, and the month before had the State of the Union address where he says, ""I wish that I had been able to do more to bridge partisan divides."" Those were his words. A week later, they make a very calculated decision not to go. I wouldn't wanted -- I would not have wanted to be Josh Earnest and having to defend that. But sometimes, that's what you have to do.WILLIAMS: You thought it was a political decision not to go.PERINO: I don't know what else it could be. It doesn't matter. Let's say that it's not. It's what it looks like.WILLIAMS: All right.PERINO: And then they've allowed it to be. And also he's the one who said he wanted to bridge partisan divides. This was a lay-up.GUILFOYLE: He is the divider in chief. This is shameful behavior.WILLIAMS: I was going to ask you about this, just this divider in chief on another issue that's close to your heart, which is the president meeting with some of the leadership of Black Lives Matter.By the way, one of the leaders said she wouldn't go. She thought the meeting was a sham. She describes herself as radical. But what did you think?GUILFOYLE: OK. Too good for it. Fine, whatever. We've made some noise about that. I mean, are you kidding me? Why doesn't he go meet with the families of the slain officers? That lost their lives. You know, it's a lot of picking and choosing that is really poking the cage at racial divide in this country.He could do a lot by showing that he is someone that is not partisan. By showing that he is someone that says all lives matter, including the men and women in blue that put it on the line every day and sadly have bled out in streets across this country, a number of them over the past -- it's very disturbing to me.WILLIAMS: So Greg, what interested me about this White House meeting was the generational divide. Here are some of the young people from Black Lives Matter saying, ""You know what? I'm not shaking hands with the president. I want revolution in the country and the like.""And then you have the president bringing in John Lewis and these other older kind of civil rights heroes, thinking, ""Wait, you should want to meet these people.""GUTFELD: It's like, even if you disagree with him, he's the president of the United States. It's disrespectful.But I've got to -- in the greater scheme of things, President Obama has senioritis. He just doesn't care. He might T.P. the White House or he might egg the Lincoln Memorial. I don't know what he's going to do.And the interesting thing about him going to Cuba, the only thing President Obama doesn't like about Cuba is Gitmo. Everything else is great. If he - - he should -- when he goes to Cuba after their 40 years of basically destroying their population, leaving them poor, destitute, maybe he should swing by Venezuela and see socialism at its -- at its pure awfulness. So he gets a fair-and-balanced approach.WILLIAMS: A lot of kids play doctor. One Florida teen was just arrested for it, accused of treating patients without a license. He walked out on his first TV interview since his arrest. We're going to show it to you next in ""The Fastest Seven.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Welcome back. Time for...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GRAPHIC: The Fastest 7(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: ... ""The Fastest Six Minutes, 15 Seconds on Television."" Three humorous stories, seven hasty minutes, one honest host.First up, ready to get creeped out? Really creeped out? The 18-year-old kid posing as a Dr. Malachi Love-Robinson -- and no, I'm not kidding about his name. Busted twice for impersonating a doc. Our little love doctor pretended to be...GUILFOYLE: Of course.BOLLING: ... a gynecologist.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you a doctor of anything? Anything at all?MALACHI LOVE-ROBINSON, ARRESTED FOR IMPERSONATING DOCTOR: I do currently hold a Ph.D.? In what, I don't feel comfortable disclosing because that is not the issue here.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you a fraud? Because it seem like everything you're saying to me is either evasive or an outright lie.LOVE-ROBINSON: I don't appreciate your tone. I don't appreciate the way you're portraying this interview to actually be. I'm sorry. I'm going to have to cut this interview short.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And in fact he did, walking out the door.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: That's the first time I saw that.GUTFELD: First, I was going to say that, OK, this is awful. Because he was seeing patients. The patient had problems. He couldn't diagnose them. He should go away -- he should go away for a long time. He's putting lives in danger. But I'm beginning to think this might be a prank. Because he seems like, could be this a total put-on?How did he do it twice?WILLIAMS: How did he get an office?GUTFELD: That's what I'm saying.WILLIAMS: And how would you show up and think this guy who looks like a child is a doctor?PERINO: What if he was treating an 86-year-old woman?GUTFELD: He was preying on patients that probably -- I don't know.WILLIAMS: I'll tell you what. If that was my family, they would shoot him.GUILFOYLE: No. He's obviously a sociopath. He has so many DSM 5, like, you know, those classifications. He should go away forever. BOLLING: G-Swiz (ph) and Yeezus feud hitting the boiling point. Kanye melted down backstage during a ""SNL"" live rehearsals last weekend. It's epic. Listen in.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KANYE WEST, POP STAR: They took my (EXPLETIVE DELETED) stage off of ""SNL"" without asking me. Now I'm bummed. That and Taylor Swift, fake (EXPLETIVE DELETED).

By the way, did you hear what, he's $50 million in the hole, but he wants a billion dollars from Mark Zuckerberg?GUILFOYLE: OK. Well, but he's married to a Kardashian. I think he's going -- you know, he's going to be OK. They have everything. They have Kardashian, like, tanning cream, bronzer glow. Sounds pretty good. He's not going to have to worry about money.
