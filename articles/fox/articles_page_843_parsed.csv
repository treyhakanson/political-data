This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.PAUL GIGOT, FOX NEWS HOST:  This week on the ""Journal Editorial Report,"" the Republican presidential hopefuls square off in their third debate of the2016 campaign.  Will some breakout performances lead to a shake up in the GOP field, or can the so-called outsiders hang on to their front runner status?Plus, Paul Ryan takes the speaker's gavel, promising to fix a broken House.   So can he unite a fractured GOP Congress and repair its damaged reputation?Find out after these headlines.(FOX NEWS REPORT)GIGOT:  Welcome to the ""Journal Editorial Report.""  I'm Paul Gigot.The Republican presidential candidates squared off this week in their third debate of the 2016 campaign.  While Donald Trump and Ben Carson took center stage in Boulder, Colorado, Wednesday, some of the over candidates managed to steal the spotlight.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  She spent over a week telling the families of victims and the American people that it was because of a video.  Yet, the main stream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.  It was the week she was exposed as a liar.   (CHEERING)(APPLAUSE)GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, R-N.J., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Wait a second.  Wait a second.  We have $19 trillion in debt, people out of work, ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us, and we are talking about fantasy football?  Can we stop?(CHEERING)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  You look at the question -- Donald Trump, are you a comic book villain?  Ben Carson, can you do math?  John Kasich, will insult two people over here?  Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?  Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?  How about talking about the substantive issues people care about?(CHEERING)  (END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT:  Joining the panel this week, Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; columnist, Mary Anastasia O'Grady; and assistant page editor, James Freeman; and Washington columnist, Kim Strassel.  Kim, this debate showed that the Republican contest is volatile.  Nobody will march from front to back as the front-runner.  There are a lot of people who potentially could break through and get the nomination.  Who do you think broke through this week?  KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  Look, we are past the introduction stage at this point.  Voters are looking for more substance.  You did see some of the Republican insiders -- remember, this is supposed to be about outsiders, but instead, the people who shone were Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and --  (CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  Experienced politicians.  STRASSEL:  Yes.  People who have done this for a while.  The reason they did is because they probably have a pretty good understanding of what voters want and need.  They want someone who will be an effective advocate for them, someone who will go after Democrats.  And that's what these people were presenting up on stage.  GIGOT:  So, Mary, who did you think stood out in your mind?  MARY ANASTASIA O'GRADY, COLUMNIST:  Obviously, Marco Rubio did very well.  I don't think he presented a lot of substance.  I think Chris Christie was the one who actually talked more specifically about Social Security and attacking the problems of Social Security.  In terms of substance, he was the best.  And of course --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  Is he breaking through that it impresses people or is it his manner, the sort of, look, you want somebody to take on Hillary Clinton, look at me, I'm the guy who can do it.  (LAUGHTER)O'GRADY:  He's a former prosecutor.  He can think on his feet.  He's articulate.  I think he'll have a problem because of the fact that he's from a blue state and he hasn't really been conservative on a lot of issues.  One of the things that could get him in trouble from the other night was his comments on solar power.  He said, you know, this is something that's a private-sector initiative.  In fact, the state of New Jersey has been subsidizing solar power.  That will catch up with him, I'm afraid.  GIGOT:  Conservatives don't necessarily trust him.  He's a good performer.  What about Marco Rubio, Dan?  DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR:  Let's talk for a second about Hillary Clinton.  We watched her in her debate a year ago or so, and you know what, she was good.  You need a candidate who can stand on a stage and debate Hillary Clinton.  You need somebody who is in the big leagues of politics.  Those three clips we showed of Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Chris Christie showed three politicians who can punch it out in different ways, different styles.  But they are all able to talk about the issues on the table in a way they can connect to people listening.  GIGOT:  Debating well doesn't necessarily mean you will be president.  HENNINGER:  These aren't debates.  (LAUGHTER)They are presentation exercises.  Who can present ideas the easiest, best and most coherently?  They don't really debate with one another.  GIGOT:  So what impresses you, James, about Marco Rubio?  Why do you think-- universally, people are saying he did well.  Why?  JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR:  I think we have seen before he's articulate and a compelling speaker.  What you saw in this debate was the preparation.  That suggests he can manage at least a small staff and effectively task out ideas.  I assume he's not the one researching each particular issue.  It suggests a very good organization building up behind him.  Really, like a kid's soccer coach, I would give everybody a medal except for Jeb Bush and the CNBC moderators because I thought --(CROSSTALK)  GIGOT:  He grades on a curve.  (LAUGHTER)FREEMAN:  What you saw was an impressive, articulate group often, despite the moderators, trying to talk substance.  O'GRADY:  I think actually what the guys understand is the viewers come away with a feeling about who the person is more than specifics about any individual policy.  Marco Rubio comes off as a happy warrior.  You know, he made a joke about his book and how it's on sale as a paperback edition.  He made reference to his mother and how he's against anything that harms his mother.  I think that gave people kind of a lightness about him and a positive feeling as opposed to some of the other candidates who are more like skulls.  GIGOT:  Kim, why is Cruz somebody to watch not just based on the debate performance but going forward?  STRASSEL:  Watch Ted Cruz, because Ted Cruz has been shrewd in his strategy.  He's deliberately contrasting himself in a subtle way with the Marco Rubio, the happy warrior.  He's trying to channel conservative anger.  He's being very specific in trying to tag evangelical voter, Tea Party voters.  He feels they are up for grabs.  That's why you see him rising in the polls.  You may end up in the end with a race that pits Cruz against more of a Marco Rubio candidate who is more of the kind of big-tent person.  HENNINGER:  Exactly.  I think what we are seeing is that Marco Rubio and Cruz seem to be the two candidates that have a plan going forward.  They have an idea of who they want to appeal to and how they want to do it.  You can see them headed towards the primaries in a way that will allow those two to rise from the rest of the pack, I think.  GIGOT:  Still a long way to go, though.  All right.  When we come back, they are still leading in the polls but how did the so-called outsider candidates fare in this week's debate?  Our panel's thoughts after the break.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. JOHN KASICH, R-OHIO, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  They talk about we are going to have a 10 percent tithe to fund the government and we'll fix everything with waste, fraud and abuse, or we'll just be great?  Folks, we've got to wake up.  We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.  You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody with the know-how, the discipline.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT:  Ohio Governor John Kasich Wednesday night taking a shot at the so- called outsiders in the race, including Donald Trump and Ben Carson.  James, that was clearly a thought out, strategic play.  Why do you think Kasich did that, and will it help him?  FREEMAN:  He's trying to present himself as the conservative reformer who has gotten it done and can do it in the future.  He has a few problems.  One, substantive.  The math can work on a low, flat, tax rate system.  GIGOT:  Maybe not 10 percent.  But 20 or something like that.  FREEMAN:  I would say even in the teens.  You look at Cruz and Rand Paul, they basically collect the revenue with essentially value-added tax on business.  GIGOT:  Right.  FREEMAN:  The point is it can be done.  This is not an impossible idea to have a low, flat, tax rate system.  The economics are flawed.  More than that, it is a muddled message to the electorate because he's saying I'm the conservative reformer who got it done.  But he lays out his liberal positions, and the voter is left to wonder what they are getting here.  GIGOT:  The other thing about Kasich's broadside is, it wasn't so much aimed at Carson and Trump but at some ways at the voters, saying, wake up, people!  You're out of it!  Get with it!  That's not necessarily the way to get them.  O'GRADY:  Both Bush and Kasich are frustrated because they are governors with successful records in office.  They can't understand why no one is coming to them.  But their problem is, in that frustration, they are coming off as angry.  Not only as he went after the voter but he seems really, really angry.  And that's not going to attract voters.  That's his problem.  GIGOT:  How do you think Trump did, Dan?  HENNINGER:  I think he held his own.  He didn't do that well.  One of the things Trump said that jumped out at me was the attack on John Kasich when he started saying he's the guy at the end of the table.  (CROSSTALK)HENNINGER:  And he goes, ""and you can have him.""  (LAUGHER)Donald Trump is starting to sound like Sonny Corleone --(LAUGHTER)-- the character from ""The Godfather.""  Who is he going to beat up next?(LAUGHTER)He's not getting better, and that's the problem.  GIGOT:  There isn't a lot there.  (CROSSTALK)FREEMAN:  Yeah, I thought his counter punch on Kasich was brilliant.  He tied him to Lehman Brothers and said, you used to say you were going to be Mr. Nice guy and not attack anyone.  What are you doing now?  (LAUGHTER)I thought it was great.  I also think Trump sounded as reasonable as he has.  He talked about opening immigration, more high-tech, high-skill immigrants.  Sounds good.  GIGOT:  What about Ben Carson, Kim.  This was his first time at center stage in the debate.  More eyes on him.  How did he do?  STRASSEL:  He was his normal, low-key self.  That's not necessarily bad for him.  A lot of people are attracted to what they view as his common-sense approach.  I think his problem though -- and we are seeing it again and again in debates and we saw it again that night -- is that when faced with serious policy questions, he comes across as a little befuddled sometimes.  That's certainly something that's been noticed by voters, especially as they are paying more attention.  He was asked questions, the answers for which were either he seemed to stumble a little bit or they came out like his answer on price control, not necessarily reassuring to voters.  GIGOT:  Let's look at an exchange between Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEB BUSH, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term.  You should be showing up to work.  Literally, the Senate, what is it like a French work week?  Three days where you have to show up?  (LAUGHTER)You can campaign.  Or just resign and let someone else take the job.  RUBIO:  I don't remember you ever complain complaining about John McCain's vote record.  The only reason why you are doing it now is we are running for the same position and someone has convinced you attacking me will help you.  (CROSSTALK)RUBIO:  Here's the bottom line.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO:  My campaign is about the future of America, not about attacking anyone else on stage.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT:  Mary, that didn't go well for the governor.  And he went with that line.  It was clearly rehearsed.  He wanted to do it.  They even leaked they would attack Rubio, which meant Rubio was prepared for it.  He had just taken down the questioner on the same issue and Jeb still raised the point and gave Rubio the opening.  O'GRADY:  My problem with the exchange was not that he raised the point but that after Rubio hit back at him, he didn't respond.  That was something similar when he asked Trump to apologize to his wife in a previous debate.  You know, there was no follow up.  I think that makes Jeb look weak.  He doesn't continue the fight and show that he wants to win.  GIGOT:  Can Jeb Bush revive his campaign?  HENNINGER:  It will be hard.  A lot of his supporters are hitting the panic button.  There is another debate in two weeks, another debate.  For the life of me, it's hard to understand why, unlike the others, Jeb Bush doesn't commit to memory four set presentations he can't articulate.  He admits he's not the best speaker on stage.  But he has to do a better job of describing where he stands.  GIGOT:  The French line was good.  (LAUGHTER)When we come back, Paul Ryan takes the speaker's gavel and takes on the job of uniting a fractured Republican Congress.  Can he fix the broken house?  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Let's be frank, the House is broken.  We're not solving problems.  We're adding to them.  And I am not interested in laying blame.  We are not settling scores.  We are wiping the slate clean.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT:  Newly elected House Speaker, Paul Ryan, Thursday, vowing to change the way business is done in Congress as he takes the reins of a fractured Republican conference.  So, Dan, what kind of a conservative is Paul Ryan?  HENNINGER:  Well, I think you would have to say he is a Ronald Reagan conservative, because Paul Ryan got into politics during the Reagan presidency.  As young as he is, he has been in politics a long time.  The sort of sense of hope and optimism, but knowing the policies that can produce that sort of thing under Reagan, which was the tax cut of 1986, Paul Ryan worked on that, he understood it.  Reducing regulations of the economy grow.  Ryan has been through the details.  And I really think he's going to play a role now in the House helping the newer members understand why they got to this point.  GIGOT:  I see him, Mary, as somebody who has a combination of real firm Philosophical conviction particularly on economics and the size of government.  But also some tactical flexibility.  He realizes that, Congress, you can't get everything you want, particularly with a Democrat in the White House.  O'GRADY:  This is why he was the best choice to be the House speaker, because he understands the tactical problem, the longer-term strategy.  We want to win, we need more Senators.  We need to get the White House.  And so he tells his team, this is what we need.  And, short term, these are the tactics we have to follow.  That's what the Republicans have been sailing on.  That's what broke apart the Republican Party in the House, was this failure to understand that the tactics for them are much different than the strategy?  GIGOT:  Kim, can he get enough people behind him, particularly there's a lot of people on the right out there who have a vested -- not so much in Congress but outside -- who have a vested interest in attacking Republicans because it helps them with their ratings or their website.  Can Ryan unite the Republican Party enough here the next 16 months?  STRASSEL:  He has been very smart about how he's done this so far.  Remember, he set back, he waited back for them to basically ask him, beg him, to come and do this, because everything was such a mess, and he gave it some thought and he did.  He has gone into that speech that he was very much talking about how there's almost a duty for the House to be -- to work again and for people to unite behind him.  So he's exerting a lot of pressure on these Republicans who have caused so much trouble and have not seemed to realize there are limits to what you can get done with the Democratic White House.  And so, I mean, I think he's got a better shot than anyone.  Some of this is going to come out the first couple of weeks, whether or not they can unite around a few things and score some victories.  GIGOT:  Here's the irony, James.  If the Congress is ineffective, dysfunctional, you know who it empowers?  Not conservatives.  The president of the United States.  FREEMAN:  Yeah.GIGOT:  Liberals.  In a way, Republicans, conservatives, really should want Ryan and the House to work, even if you don't get everything you want, because otherwise, the executive is going to run away with the government.  FREEMAN:  Right.  But they do want some things.  His predecessor obviously on the way out the door enabled the latest Obama spending binge.  But I think a good early test for Ryan, because he can make the case, is to try to get some policy changes in these year-end appropriations bills.  The spending is going to happen.  We have to live with that.  But I think he can work on policy now.  And then basically, all of next year, putting out the message that's going to potentially make Hillary Clinton uncomfortable.  GIGOT:  Nobody likes the budget deal, Mary, at least on the right.  I can't find a single person who says yeah, I love this.  But maybe it was the best they could do, given the fact they were so divided, Republicans, conservatives, on defense spending.  A lot of people wanted to break the spending caps to spend more on defense.  You give leverage to the Democrats.  O'GRADY:  Right, and I think that John Boehner, you know, he referred to this as sweeping the barn.  He sort of cleaned up --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  You know what that means.  (LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)O'GRADY:  He cleaned up this mess before he left so that Paul Ryan wouldn't have the burden of those very unpopular decisions.  GIGOT:  All right.  Thank you, all.  We have to take one more break.  When we come back, ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT:  Time now for our ""Hits and Misses"" of the week -- James?  FREEMAN:  Paul, this is a miss to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which has now encouraged a judge to start sending out $80 million in checks to people who were allegedly discriminated against in car borrowing.  See if you follow.  Auto loans, the $80 million is going out the door, AND it's going to people that based on their last names and zip codes, the government thinks are minorities.  GIGOT:  Thinks.FREEMAN:  If you're not a minority, you're supposed to send that check back.  (LAUGHTER)Make sure you do.GIGOT:  Mary?O'GRADY:  Paul, this is a hit for Pittsburgh Steelers Cornerback William Gay, who broke NFL rules last week by wearing purple cleats in the Sunday game to show solidarity with domestic violence awareness month.  The NFL fined him, and I don't blame the NFL, because they have to have uniform rules.  Nevertheless, I find it encouraging that professional football player's speaking out on this issue and I applaud him for it.  GIGOT:  Good.Dan?HENNINGER:  A public relations miss to the World Health Organization which caused an uproar this week by saying bacon and other hard meats increase your risk of colorectal cancer.  Well, that includes salami.  Salami comes from southern Italy, which is supposed to have the world's healthiest diet and cuisine.  GIGOT:  That's the wine, Dan.HENNINGER:  Yeah.(LAUGHTER)  That's for sure.  (LAUGHTER)What the Italians, who have done thousands of years of research, could have told the WHO, is eat anything in moderation and you'll be all right.  (LAUGHTER)GIGOT:  All right.  And, remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet us at JER on FNC.  That's it for this week's show.  Thanks to my panel and to all of you for watching.  I'm Paul Gigot.  We hope to see you right here next week.  ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REINCE PRIEBUS, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Americans, like so many other issues that the president is touching right now. have lost confidence in this president's ability to lead. There is a malaise in this country of how people are feelings that this president is handling big problems.REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  The president isn't on to the ballot here. Republicans are desperate to put him on the ballot because they are trying to run away from their own terrible record.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Well, the chairs of both parties on ""Fox News Sunday"" this weekend. This as the president is now campaigning in a couple of different campaign events, one of them in Maryland for the lieutenant governor who is running for governor.And as you look at the pictures, while the president is speaking, a lot of people noticed that people started moving out and leaving. In fact Reuters reported it this way, ""President Barack Obama made a rare appearance on the campaign trail on Sunday with the rally to support the Democratic candidate for governor in Maryland. But early departures of crowd members while he spoke underscored his continuing unpopularity."" Different reporters reported it differently. You see the pictures.Let's bring in our political panel here in New York, Jason Riley, editorial board member of the Wall Street Journal, Ellison Barber, staff writer for The Washington Free Beacon, and Jim Rutenberg, chief political correspondent New York Times Magazine. Jim, when you see that and you see all these ads tying back to every policy is on the ballot, you wonder how much this president is factoring in to this election.JIM RUTENBERG, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE:  Yes, that 40 percent or in thereabouts kind of approval rating is a mess. And you have a president, second term, midterms, there should be like blues songs about it if politics is more soulful. So he comes into this. It's going to be rough, and things are even worse than they may have expected.BAIER: You look at the Wall Street Journal question, which party do you prefer, registered voters say Republicans 45 percent, Democrats 43 percent. Then you go to the likely screen at it jumps, Republican 49 percent, Democrat 44 percent. Ellison, what, you know, how do you see Democrats across the board dealing with these numbers?ELLISON BARBER, WASHINGTON FREE BEACON: It's interesting because The Washington Post had a poll last week as well that they said their overall party approval rating is somewhere around 30 percent, which is the lowest it has been for them. But then you look at Republicans and their approval rating is similarly not good. I think the thing that you always go back to and look at is what the president's approval rating is. And Gallup had a poll today where the said for the 23rd quarter from July to October his average approval rating was 41.5 percent. It is difficult for Democrats to possibly combat an approval rating like that. When have the majority of Americans disapproving of the president and disapproving of him on almost every single issue. And I think that is something that for Democrats to overcome is incredibly difficult.BAIER: Jason?JASON RILEY, WALL STREET JOURNAL: And it's not just a red state Democrat problem. That's what's so remarkable about the Maryland footage. That's a deep blue state that Obama won by 26 points in 2012. It's quite remarkable I think. But what's also remarkable to me is the reaction to this from the White House which is to make overt racial appeals to get out the base. We have the president of the United States and an attorney general making overt racial appeals to voters. I find that very disturbing, Bret.       BAIER: How so?RILEY: Well, the voter ID stuff that they've been talking about constantly as if there's some sort of Republican conspiracy out there to deny blacks the franchise. It's just not true. Black voter turnout in 2012 was higher than white voter turnout in 2012. And on another level, why should blacks be eager to run to the polls to support the Senate Democrats and Harry Reid. What have they done for blacks? Black unemployment is higher. Black labor participation rates are the lowest they have been in 30 years. Black poverty is going up. Why should blacks be enthusiastic about getting out to the polls to keep the president's party in power? There's no reason for them to be. But to have a president out there pushing this racial angle, we have had stories in both the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal to this effect, I think is very troubling.BAIER: Jim, we talked about ground game. Mike Emanuel had a big piece about this. It is the factor that everybody focuses on as we come into two weeks. Democrats usually have a very strong ground game. If you look at the early votes, though, the breakdown, it's pretty evenly distributed.RUTENBERG: Yeah. And some of these early states, you're not seeing the huge Democratic advantages that you have seen in the past. I think a lot of people are looking at Colorado as maybe the first great test case in some of these ground game sort of numbers. The problem with the ground game numbers are they're very hard to track in real-time. I mean, you can say how many doors were knocked upon. We're not going to know until the very end. But I will say this. I think the Republicans have made up some ground. And I also think if this ends up being a wave election or even a half a wave election, the Democratic advantages are not going to show up.BAIER: Let's look at some of the races that are changing here. If you look at, let's see, New Hampshire, there's a new poll out in New Hampshire about Scott Brown three points back and the Real Clear Politics average I think has it even closer than that. That's one that Democrats really, Ellison, weren't really prepared to fight for.BARBER: Yeah. There are quite a few states from Iowa to Colorado that Democrats weren't thinking they were going to have to fight, and I don't think Republicans necessarily thought they were going to be able to flip them.And when I spoke to Republican staffers kind of about their ground game earlier today, they said they were more competitive in places like Iowa and Colorado because they have completely restructured the way they are doing their ground game from 2012. And you look at some of the early voting data that's come out of a place like Iowa where they say right now of the people that have voted, 43 percent of those people have been Democrats, 40 percent have been Republicans. Democrats are still ahead there, but that is substantially better than what it was last time around when only 32 percent of those early voters were actually Republicans. And Republicans say they have reached out to voters in different ways and gotten data in different ways than they have in the past.And one of the most interesting things that I think I have learned from them talking with some of the staffers about this today is they said one of things they have done is they have changed their get out the vote effort and their messaging. And in Iowa specifically they're using this tactic where they're using social pressure to target voters through pamphlets and e-mails by saying don't be the only person in your neighborhood that doesn't vote. And they say that they have noticed that that has been incredibly effective for them in somewhere like Iowa.BAIER: I tell you, if I get one more email from both parties about, you know, we're really disappointed. Answer our e-mails.One question, Georgia, this has gone the other way. Michelle Nunn has really closed that gap and some have her leading. The Real Clear Politics average is at 1.4 with the Republican up down there. But you talk about an African-American effort to get out the vote. Georgia is a place where that moves the needle.RILEY: The challenge she has is she's trying to distance herself from a president, and that doesn't go over too well with the black voters she needs to come out and support here. Kentucky, Alison Grimes has got the same problem, won't even say whether she voted for Obama. But her indifference on that or her unwillingness to come forward with that is hurting her with the black voters that she needs. So that's the -- sort of the catch 22 that these red state Democrats have.BAIER: I want to go down the line here. Is Ebola factoring into this election?RILEY: I think so, but only at the margin, only at the margin.BARBER: Maybe a little bit in terms of just there's a general dissatisfaction and distrust in the way that the government right now is handling things.  I'm not sure that it necessarily something that will be a major issue in two weeks, but it factors into the general distrust.RUTENBERG: And I would say in some states more than others. I hate to shout out to a competitor, but The Washington Post had a very good piece today about the North Carolina race where the Ebola and ISIS are just kind of shifting the campaign debate in a way that hurts Hagan, the Democrat.BAIER: We do it all the time. So thanks you for joining us. We really appreciate it. Thank you.We'll talk about all things economy with a special economic panel coming up.Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Donald Trump's son is right here to go ON THE RECORD. Eric Trump's father is not only a billionaire businessman, but right now with the latest poll numbers, his father Donald Trump is closer than any other American to walking into the White House and running this country.So, what's it like to have the Donald for a father and to work side by side with him.Eric Trump is executive vice president of development and acquisitions at the Trump Organization and he joins us.Nice to see you, Eric.ERIC TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S SON: Hey, Greta, how are you?VAN SUSTEREN: Very well. So, OK, so your father says he is a strong negotiator. You work with your father. Give me an example what he means by that.TRUMP: He is the greatest man. I have seen him my whole life. I have sat across the table from him every single day and there's no one better. I mean, he's incredibly quick. He's incredibly practical. He likes to keep things simple. He likes to get things done. He can cut through red tape. I mean, he's an amazing man and we've seen a lot of pre-negotiators. We deal with them every single day and there's no one better than he is. And he would be an amazing president for this country.VAN SUSTEREN: All right, growing up, was he the disciplinarian in the family?TRUMP: Yes, listen -- I mean, he never let us get out of line. He made us work. He instilled really great values in us. And, listen, we were the last family that was ever going to be caught dancing on a table in a nightclub. It just wasn't us.At a young age, we were put on construction sites. We worked. We worked very hard. We're expected to get great grades. You know, we were expected to perform and, you know, we did. He held us to a high standard and we never -- we never let him down. And he was amazing father and just a great guy. And, you know, still to this day, one of my best friends and my boss and my mentor. And you know, I have the utmost respect for him.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. At age 10, for instance, was he teaching you how to ride a bicycle or throw a baseball? Or were you like out negotiating deals and looking at real estate?TRUMP: I think my best memories probably are we're walking construction sites with him. We go over these big buildings, his building. We followed him around. So I think he kind of taught us the art of the deal, you know, just by being with him. But, you know, we remember -- I remember building Lego sets in his office while he was negotiating great casino deals and other things. And, you know, it was a lot of fun. So, yes, probably a little bit left of the let's go play baseball in the yard, but I mean, amazing guy.And the relationship we have is incredible. And, you know, I mean, just kind of the family dynamic we have, right? Most of the time family businesses are total disasters. And what we have been able to piece together -- he, Ivanka, Don and myself, you know, what we are doing all around the world. We're building the greatest hotels. We're building the greatest golf properties and we're just having a blast doing it.And here he is winning the G.O.P. right now and, you know, I just couldn't be more proud.VAN SUSTEREN: Do you want him to be president?TRUMP: Listen, I think the man would do an absolutely amazing job so the answer is yes. And, in fact, I have been encouraging him since before he announced, you know, to run because, you know, when you have that unique insight on a person, when you see their qualities, you see how good they are at what they do. I think he would do a phenomenal job for this country.And we've got real problems. You know, we've got $19 trillion worth of debt. We've got major, you know, trade deficits all over the place. We've got real problems in the Middle East. We've got real educational problems. And there's so many things that need to be fixed in this country, I mean, infrastructure.By the way, there would be no better infrastructure president than he would be. He is an amazing, amazing builder. And he is passionate about it. And quite frankly, I mean, he doesn't need to set aside his life to do this. You know, he's got an amazing company and he's doing it. And I think it's actually very selfless. It's really an amazing thing.VAN SUSTEREN: What do you make of his sort of spicy language? I mean, he has a very spicy language. He's very blunt. Calls people stupid. He has called people out. You know, he doesn't stop for fools. And sometimes, he punches back real hard.TRUMP: Yes, he does punch back really hard. And that's one of the things I actually admire most about him. And he can punch back real hard. And I think that's one of the reasons people are attracted to him. They're sick of the PC. They're sick of the nonsense. You know, they want a person who will fight for this country and won't be bought by the lobbyists.And, you know, he is that guy. And, you know, again, I think that's really what gives him charm, what gives his appeal and why people love him.VAN SUSTEREN: You said -- I think you'd been quote on saying that he won the debate last night. Obviously, he wasn't on the stage. He was tweeting as he watched the debate. But why do you say he won, he wasn't even there?TRUMP: Yes, listen, his tweets are great last night. And literally the commentary, I was getting my own Twitter, you know, about his tweets last night were amazing. But I think I -- I think I had a tough time getting through the debate. I know a lot of people had a tough time getting through the debate last night.And, you know, when he speaks, he speaks as a person. He speaks not in the little, you know, one word sound bites. I mean, he really speaks as a person. You can kind of see his emotion come through when -- you know, I think he has done a great job in his past debates. I think he has won all the past debates. And, you know, I just didn't see the same flare last night, I didn't see the same level of energy from any of the candidates.VAN SUSTEREN: Well, he's done -- I mean, the poll numbers are quiet good for him today. I think in Nevada, he's up 16 points. In South Carolina, 18, or vice versa. I mean, his poll numbers are astronomical.What does he say about them to you? I mean, does he just expect them? I mean, he is certainly is a guy who doesn't -- I mean, he certainly is a confident guy. Let's say it that way.TRUMP: Well, he is a confident guy. He's an amazing guy, right? I mean, everything he's ever touched turns to gold. And, you know, I saw South Carolina today. He's winning Nevada today and some of the other states. And these are really battleground states. I mean, these are super important states.And, you know, listen, he just became a politician three months ago. And this is very new thing for him. And, you know, I'm just proud of how well he is doing. I think he is incredibly proud of how well he is doing. But I think it also says something about kind of, you know, politics in this country. They want something new. They want something refreshing. They want something that's kind of knocks the status quo. And I think it really talks to the sentiment of this country.VAN SUSTEREN: He gets so mad at all of us, though. He gets mad -- he got mad at Fox. He gets mad at NBC. He gets mad at us and, you know, says he is never going to talk to us again. And then we're all sort of like get back into, you know, talking business. What's going on with him on that?TRUMP: Well, I think passion is a good thing. You know, I mean, he is very passionate about himself. You know, he takes a lot of pride on himself. He holds himself to a very, very high standard. And he also likes to be treated fairly.I mean, he is actually a man of amazing morals and values. I mean, he likes to be treated fairly. And listen, Greta, you know better than anybody, the media is not always fair. And listen, when they're not, he's willing to punch back and hit them his whole life. And, you know, this really made him the success that, you know, he is today. And I think he'll definitely do that for this country.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. So who gets the family business if he should become president? I mean, you've got two siblings and the three of you had been working with your father for a long time. Who's going to be the CEO?TRUMP: Well, you know what, Ivanka is my best friend in the world. Don is my best friend in the world. I mean, we really have a great system together. We worked hand in hand on everything. We're opening up hotels all over the world, we're building the best golf courses, the best financial buildings and we're having a great time doing it. So, believe me, it will be a team effort and you know, all with love knowing --(CROSSTALK)VAN SUSTEREN: I guess that's a no answer. I mean, I don't get the answer. I don't get to which sibling is going to be, you know, stepping all over each other. I don't get that. I don't get that.TRUMP: I mean, there won't be. I mean, we've never had a quarrel in our lives. We really best friends. We do everything together. We do different hotels. We all, you know, we all run different properties and, you know, it really, really works well.So kind of contrary to so many family businesses, which are disastrous. But we have an amazing recipe, and we are best friends, and we are kind of on this war path together and we are having a great time doing it.VAN SUSTEREN: Do you think he wants it? I mean, you know, some people are just for all their lives, they want to be president of the United States. Is he one of those people that, you know, this has just come at the right time for him to run?TRUMP: I couldn't be more sure of it. Greta, listen, he wouldn't do it if he didn't want it, right? I mean, if not --VAN SUSTEREN: But did he always want it? Is this something he really wants? Or is this, you know, like a passion?(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: There is no, no question in my mind. Not only does he want it, he is going to win. He's going to take it all the way to the end. I mean, I can tell you that emphatically. He is a man that does not lose. I mean, everything he touches turns to gold. He does not lose.And believe me, Greta, I mean, he's got a great life, he's got a great business. We're doing great things. You know, if he didn't want this, if he wasn't into it, he wouldn't be doing it. It's a -- it's a gruelling race. Believe me.You know, politics is a tough, tough business as you know better than anybody else. He wants it. He's going to win it. And he's there to take it, you know, all the way through.VAN SUSTEREN: Eric, thanks for joining us. I hope you bring your brother and sister back next time or make them come talk to us, will you?TRUMP: I absolutely will. I absolutely will. Great being with you, Greta.VAN SUSTEREN: All right, thank you."	['Trump']	[]
