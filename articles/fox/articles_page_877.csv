This is a rush transcript from ""Hannity,"" October 12, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to ""Hannity.""  And tonight, two explosive reports reveal that the mainstream media is doing everything it can to try and utterly destroy Donald Trump's presidential campaign, of course, all in an attempt to put Hillary Clinton in the White House.TMZ is reporting, quote, ""NBC execs had a plan to time the release of the Donald Trump audio to have maximum impact on both the second presidential debate and the general election.""  The Washington Post, however, beat them to the punch.  Sources within NBC also reportedly told TMZ that network decision makers have, quote, ""open disdain"" for Trump and are not willing to tell the truth about when they first learned about the existence of this tape.Now, we asked NBC News about this report.  They provided us with this statement.  Quote, ""There is no truth to this.  NBC News officials learned of the tape last week.""And that's not the only report we have.  According to CNN, NBC News is ordering footage from Trump's hit show ""Celebrity Apprentice"" to be thoroughly reviewed to try and dig up potentially damaging comments from the GOP nominee.  We asked the network about this report, as well.  We've not heard back.Plus, Variety reports just two weeks before the election, NBC's ""Law and Order SVU"" is now supposed to air an episode featuring an Trump-like character whose presidential campaign is damaged by several women accusing the candidate of misconduct.  Really?  Now, We asked NBC about the upcoming episode.  They told us to remember that this is a fictional show.Now, on top of all of this inexcusable, blatant liberal bias, emails released by WikiLeaks allegedly from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's personal account show an alarming collusion between the Clinton campaign and the supposedly unbiased press.  Now, the findings are downright disturbing and should concern all of you, every American.Here they are.  CNBC's John Harwood -- he offered advice to the campaign.   Keep in mind he moderated a primary debate and bragged how he got under Trump's skin.  A New York Times reporter allowed the campaign to actually edit out certain quotes from Hillary Clinton before an article was published.The Boston Globe -- they launched a coordinated effort to try and make Clinton look good during the Democratic primaries.  And the head of Univision pressured the campaign to attack Trump harder over immigration.  Now, the Clinton campaign boasted, quote, ""that every single interviewer was for her,"" meaning Hillary, after her trip to Michigan.And Donna Brazile, while working for CNN, the Clinton News Network, allegedly shared a question with the Clinton campaign before a town hall on the network.  Brazile denies this.  And if that's not enough, it gets worse.WikiLeaks also uncovered evidence that Clinton's campaign was tipped off by the Department of Justice about the release of information about Hillary's private email server.  And the State Department also alerted team Clinton about when emails connected to the Democratic nominee would be made public.  That's just the tip of the iceberg.Here with reaction, editor-in-chief Lifezette, FOX News contributor, nationally syndicated radio host Laura Ingraham.  And I can't believe I see him here -- and FOX news contributor Tucker Carlson.  Good to see you both.Laura, let's start with you.  It's NBC.  It's CNBC.  It's Univision.  CNN -- they're giving questions before a town hall.  It's literally -- let's see, The New York Times, The Boston Globe, The Washington Post, all an extension in every way imaginable of the Clinton press office!  Now, I said...LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  All these media outlets, Sean, that you just rattled off -- they're all part of what is essentially a super-duper- PAC for Hillary, OK?  This is beyond the super-PAC.  This is more influential than any super-PAC because it controls what people see and what people hear and what people read.And the way campaigns are framed -- it's still very important.  Even with the internet and even with talk radio and FOX, the way the mainstream media frames stories and rallies and news cycles still has an enormous, I think, influence on the way especially younger people feel, people who aren't all that steeped in politics, who just maybe take a quick read of things.And it's everything that we always thought and confirmed in these WikiLeaks emails, and it's going to simply lead to more cynicism about the press, more distrust toward the mainstream media.  And you know, they're -- they're -- I think they're hoping to get some more tapes on Trump so they can take the spotlight off themselves.  But as usual, the finger's always pointed back at you.HANNITY:  You know, I think, Tucker, the other thing is she admits she's one person in public and she's a totally different person behind the scenes!  And she's exposed -- for example, she supports open trade.  She wants not only open borders, she wants an open hemisphere!TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.HANNITY:  Six hundred million people can come in here.  She's got friends pretty much everywhere covering up for her.  She gets paid -- she got a public position and a private position.  She supports fracking.  She doesn't support fracking.  She supports Keystone.  She doesn't support Keystone.The whole thing is like reminiscent of the former Soviet Union and the propaganda, you know, towards the public and the contempt towards the public!  And I don't know if the public can absorb this all in 27 days!CARLSON:  Well, the most effective propaganda, of course, is not simply to distort the truth, but not to report it at all.  I mean, if an important story happens and the press ignores it, did it actually happen?I mean, so for example, we've just seen five separate WikiLeaks document dumps in the last 48 hours, John Podesta's emails.  Some of them are not interesting.  Some of them are very interesting and deeply revealing.  You go on The Washington Post Web site, one of the biggest and most important newspapers in the world, as of this afternoon, and there are no stories about it!  There are no stories about it on the front page of their Web site.The only story that even refers to it is the utterly unsubstantiated claim from the Clinton campaign that this is part of a Russian propaganda effort.   They don't know that that's true.  They're just throwing it out there.  And that's the only thing The Post covered.Over at VOX, which is a major, very highly valued liberal news site, there are no stories at all other than John Podesta's risotto recipe, which showed up in these emails.  But all the rest of this stuff completely ignored.The press, by doing that or not doing it, devalues its own currency.  This is going to be over in a month!  And where are they going to be then, with no credibility whatsoever?  Actually, this hurts them.  This is shortsighted and dumb, and I think it's the beginning of the end of the old media order.HANNITY:  I think it is, but unfortunately you're right.  I think a lot of people still trust those outlets when they shouldn't be trusted.  They're an extension of the campaign.You know, there's even revelations poor Chelsea Clinton had enough sense to realize the significance and seriousness of the pay-to-play issue with the Clinton Foundation and access to her mother when she was secretary of state.  She was called a spoiled brat for revealing it.But then we find out as it relates to the money they were raising with the Clinton Foundation for Haiti, Laura...INGRAHAM:  Yes.HANNITY:  ... that they're literally separating out the Clinton donors and friends of Bill to...INGRAHAM:  Yes, FOBs.HANNITY:  ... give them access to opportunities to make money!INGRAHAM:  But again, this is what all of us thought all along.  When the Clinton Foundation ran down to do all that work in Haiti -- and much of it has been called into question.  And we wondered at the time, Well, is this State Department contracts?  I'm how is this all working?  And it turns out that at least on a few occasions -- and I imagine this is just the tip of the iceberg -- that Clinton friends got preferential treatment.And Sean, the other issue that I thought -- as a Roman Catholic, I found to be so disturbing is the Jennifer Palmieri comments and the Podesta comments about Catholics, especially more traditional Catholics, Catholic converts like myself.  They didn't mention people by name.  But the most, I think, derisive and dismissive...HANNITY:  Oh, it's even worse than that!INGRAHAM:  ... and nasty comments...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  You've got John Podesta...INGRAHAM:  Then they want to the Catholic church, as well, according to what...HANNITY:  They're talking about infiltrating...INGRAHAM:  ... John Podesta said.HANNITY:  ... the Catholic church with left-wing, progressive ideology -- get this -- to foment revolution within the Catholic church!INGRAHAM:  Yes.HANNITY:  Who thinks like this unless you're a statist, Marxist really radical Alinskyite disciple?Let me give you a few more quickies here.  We know that -- we learned that Hillary hates everyday Americans between Podesta and Palmieri.  We know, Tucker, that they said, I know she's begun to hate everyday Americans, but I think we should use it once.  I mean, seriously?And then we've got what we talked about, infiltrating the Catholic church.   And also, they knew that Saudi Arabia and Qatar are funding ISIS.  But she still took their money!  I mean, it's breathtaking what we're learning here!(LAUGHTER)CARLSON:  (INAUDIBLE)HANNITY:  Why are you laughing?  It's not funny.CARLSON:  Well, because it's every suspicion you ever had about the Clintons, like...HANNITY:  It's true.CARLSON:  If you or I are sitting around, having a beer -- I wonder what they're talking about over there at the Center for American Progress or the Clinton Global Initiative.  They're fighting about money, right, because they're all getting rich in this stuff and they're all needling each other behind the scenes and saying nasty things about each other over -- over the spoils.They're attacking normal people, religious people, people of faith, right?   And they're also basically lying about their motivations about everything.   And now we rip off the covers, and it turns out to all be true!  So we're pretty prescient, I guess!HANNITY:  It's beyond scary...INGRAHAM:  And Sean -- Sean...HANNITY:  Yes.  Go ahead.INGRAHAM:  It's about -- as it always is about with the Clintons.  It's about power and it's about money.  They got a lot of money.  They have almost $170 million.  But they always want to hold onto the power, and they dole out the goodies to their friends and others who've been good to them over the years.  And that is the corruption of Washington that Trump is really running against now, and I think it's really smart...(CROSSTALK)INGRAHAM:  ... fed up with this.HANNITY:  Well, think about this, Laura.  You have the Republican establishment against him, the Democratic establishment, the media establishment against him, even the U.N. establishment, globalist establishment is against him.  I mean, can anybody overcome that united group of power if they're all opposing you?  It's not easy.INGRAHAM:  No.  That's why most people become members of the establishment.   It's a lot easier.  It's a lot more convenient.  And you go to, I guess, a lot better parties.  I don't like those parties anyway, so it never bothered me, but -- yes, it's really hard.  He's going to have a hard -- a hard slog, but if anyone can do it, I think he can because he's swinging for the fences now, and I think -- I think he's got to -- he's got to some events that now bring all of this together, and whether it's religious liberty speech or, you know, really highlighting the corruption beyond just the rallies.  I think it's time for him to go back to some of those communities, underserved communities that he did...HANNITY:  I think that's a good idea.INGRAHAM:  ... in August.  You know...HANNITY:  Tucker, thanks for staying up late.  I saw you on ""Fox & Friends"" this morning.  Nice of you to come back.  You've been missing...CARLSON:  Are you kidding?  I love it!HANNITY:  You've been MIA.  I don't know what this is all about.CARLSON:  I've been trying to elbow my way in.  Thanks for letting me come.HANNITY:  All right, guys.  Good to see you both.INGRAHAM:  Good to see you.HANNITY:  Coming up -- the WikiLeaks email dump exposes how Hillary Clinton thinks that she can act one way in public and a very different way in private.  We'll explain.Plus, tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Crooked Hillary wants to end forever the American independence that our founders gave us.  Our great founders are spinning in their graves!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  With only 27 days to go, Trump is holding nothing back.  His son, Eric Trump, will join us in studio.And a quick programming note.  Be sure to tune in tomorrow night at 10:00 PM.  Three of Bill Clinton's accusers will join us on set.  Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey and Paul Jones will be here.Also tomorrow night, you'll meet a woman named Kathy Shelton.  She was allegedly raped at the age of 12.  Hillary Clinton defended the man accused of sexually assaulting Kathy.  Wait until you hear her on tape laughing and basically admitting she thinks he's guilty.  an episode of ""Hannity"" you don't want to miss.  Set your DVRs tomorrow night, 10:00 Eastern.We'll continue.  More ""Hannity"" right after the break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)HANNITY:  And Welcome back to ""Hannity.""  Now, WikiLeaks continues to expose what Hillary Clinton tells you, the American people, in public -- well, that's completely different from what she says in private.  But don't take my word for it.  Hillary bragged about this in a 2013 Wall Street speech where she paid (sic) a lot of money.  Now, the Clintons have also made it clear that they don't care much for the average, everyday Americans, the people that make this country great.  We'll have more on that in just a second.But first, released emails also reveal major contradictions from Hillary on key policies and topics.  Now, Clinton says she wants a 550 percent increase of Syrian migrants coming into America.  But according to the e- mails and a 2013 speech, Clinton actually admitted what Donald Trump's been saying, that refugees cannot be properly vetted and could put countries they enter at risk.  Is she willing to gamble with your life?  Is that what she's saying?Now, Clinton also says she wants a no-fly zone in Syria, yet the email shows she was skeptical about the idea during a speech for Goldman Sachs.  Remember, another $225,000 payday.  And she was also unsure about supporting or opposing the Keystone pipeline and also praised fracking, despite now being a so-called champion of climate change.Now, Clinton is also a fierce critic of Wall Street, big banks in public, but she praised their actions after the 2007 financial collapse.  Now, she also favored a plan that would cut Social Security, and she says just the opposite to you, the American people.And unlike what she says now, in paid speeches, Clinton supported open borders and open trade.  She also said she'd like to see the U.S. move towards a socialized health care system just like what they have in Canada, single payer.But these's also issues about how the Clintons really feel about you, the American people.  Now, WikiLeaks uncovered that Clinton hated using the phrase ""everyday Americans"" during speeches, and that she was, quote, ""far removed"" from the struggles of the middle class.Now, her campaign spokeswoman viciously attacked and mocked Catholics and evangelicals.  And a Clinton activist asked John Podesta, quote, ""Well, what is wrong with the people of New Hampshire?""  This was just before Clinton lost the primary to Bernie Sanders.  Clinton also referred to Trump supporters as a ""basket of deplorable"" that were irredeemable.Well, now Bill Clinton is taking these attacks on Trump backers even further, and here's what he said yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The other guy's base is what I grew up in.  You know, I'm basically your standard redneck.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Here with reaction, CEO of Crowd Pack and former adviser to British prime minister David Cameron -- Steve Hilton is with us.  And from the American Conservative Union, chairman Matt Schlapp.I want to ask you, in the context, I look at the polls.  We still don't have polling post-second debate, still don't have polling post this WikiLeaks, which is now even being revealed every day.  So I don't know what the real poll numbers are.  Nobody really knows.But you lived through this with Brexit.  You saw the ups and downs in the polls there.  There were people that were convinced no way that would happen, but it happened.  Do you see similarities in this election?TOM HILTON, FMR. ADVISER TO DAVID CAMERON:  Yes.  There are so many similarities.  I mean, one of them is what we've been seeing here, which is the complete unity of the establishment, the media establishment, the political establishment, you name it.  In the U.K. during Brexit, they all said that if you support ""leave,"" you're some kind of xenophobic and you're a racist and you've got to be on the side of the EU.  And yet the people rejected that, and they said, No, we're sick and tired of being told what to think by the establishment.HANNITY:  Yes.HILTON:  Now, a lot of the time, because of that shaming that was going on, people actually wouldn't even admit that they...HANNITY:  What was the...HILTON:  ... would support Brexit.HANNITY:  ... disparity in the polls?HILTON:  Well, just before the vote, I think even on the day, they were predicting -- I mean, David Cameron himself was given a prediction on the day of the vote that he would win by about 5 points.  And it turned out to be the other way.HANNITY:  The opposite.HILTON:  Exactly.  So he was really far off.  Now, I think the other that we're seeing with this is jut the total cynicism of what's going on in Washington and with the Clinton campaign.  And I think that also is something that will really get people fired up and angry.  And as long as the focus can be on that, I think that there's still everything to play for in the election.HANNITY:  Matt, there are those similarities.  You got -- look, the Republican Party establishment -- they're against Trump.  Every Democrat -- they're against Trump.  They're the establishment.  Media establishment -- well, we just exposed that in the last segment.  You've got even the U.N.I mean, you have every single major conglomerate power broker at every level now against Donald Trump, just like in -- just like before the Brexit vote.MATT SCHLAPP, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  That's right.HANNITY:  Do you think there would be a swing in the polls like what we're describing here?SCHLAPP:  Look, Sean, I think you're right.  Be very dubious of any numbers you see now.  Between what was released when this well-orchestrated tape drop and the fact that Donald Trump, I think, had a gangbuster debate performance in St. Louis, and now you have all these WikiLeaks, which are just reminding us what Hillary Clinton is all about is the disdain for the average working person in this country -- when you put that all together, I don't think you can really trust these numbers for several days to come, maybe a week or so.HANNITY:  Do you...SCHLAPP:  I think...(CROSSTALK)SCHLAPP:  ... we're going to know where this race sits.HANNITY:  Do you think in 27 days, this level of contempt, the exposure of corruption and collusion between the Clinton campaign and the media, the Clinton campaign and the Department of Justice, the Clinton campaign and the White House, the, Let's take one position privately and another position publicly...SCHLAPP:  That's right.HANNITY:  Do you think people absorb all of this in time?SCHLAPP:  I worry about that, Sean.  But the good news is, is this, which is the American people are getting the honest truth.  When the cameras are off and the doors are shut and...HANNITY:  Very different people.SCHLAPP:  ... Hillary Clinton and her senior advisers really talk about the American people -- what they said about Catholics that we learned today is repugnant!  It's not consistent with American values.  They don't understand what makes this country great.  And I think if those are the themes that come out just broadly from these leaks, I think it sets into the voter why they want to make change, and Donald Trump is the candidate of that change!HANNITY:  I've got to roll.  Thank you.All right, coming up next on this busy news night tonight on ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  The election of Hillary Clinton would lead, in my opinion, to the almost total destruction of our country as we know it!(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Donald Trump calling out Hillary Clinton at a massive rally today in Florida.  Up next, his son Eric Trump will join us right here in studio.Also, later, Sheriff David Clarke, Larry Elder, the Reverend Darrell Scott -- they're here to weigh in on the mainstream media bias and collusion that's going on and how they're in the tank for Clinton.Quick programming note.  The third and final presidential debate slated for next Wednesday in Las Vegas, and of course, it's going to be hosted by our own Chris Wallace.  You don't want to miss it.We got more ""Hannity"" right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  The election of Hillary Clinton would lead, in my opinion, to the almost total destruction of our country as we know it!  She would be the most dishonest and the most corrupt person ever elected to high office.Americans have had it with the years and decades of Clinton corruption.  It's corruption.  Crooked Hillary wants to end forever the American independence that our founders gave us.  Our great founders are spinning in their graves!  Our founders are spinning in their graves!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Donald Trump earlier today back on the campaign trail at a huge, massive rally in Florida.  Also tonight, WikiLeaks released an email from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.  Look at this subject line, ""Needy Latinos and one easy call.""  Wow!Joining us now with reaction, from the Trump Organization, Donald Trump's son, Eric Trump.  How are you?  Good to see you.ERIC TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S SON:  Thanks, Sean.  How are you?  It's great to be with you.HANNITY:  I saw you had tweeted that out earlier today, so obviously, you're paying attention to this.  Imagine your father talked about ""needy Latinos.""E. TRUMP:  When does it end?  You know, first it's deplorable.  Then it's irredeemables.  It was super-predators...HANNITY:  Rednecks.E. TRUMP:  ... before then.  Today it was rednecks. Now we're talking about Christians, evangelicals.  We're getting killed earlier today by -- by these emails.  Now it's needy Latinos.  It is -- you know, and they talk about us being the party of bigotry and the party of hate, and it's not until Julian Assange comes along and obviously releases these emails via WikiLeaks...HANNITY:  The real Democrat (ph) -- remember the original release on the DNC?  What did it show?  It showed racism, sexism, misogyny, anti-Semitic language in there!  And that's the very arguments they make against Republicans every four years.  That's them!E. TRUMP:  Look what else they showed.  They showed corruption in Haiti.   It showed that Donna Brazile was giving Hillary...HANNITY:  Questions.E. TRUMP:  ... questions, you know, ahead of time for these (INAUDIBLE)HANNITY:  Conspiring against Bernie.E. TRUMP:  It truly shows the true level of corruption in our government and in the Democratic Party.  I mean,it's actually very, very scary.  And this is serious stuff.  And it's actually a real shame that most of the mainstream media isn't paying attention to -- you do, but most of the mainstream media isn't paying attention to this because this undermines democracy.  It undermines the way of our life!HANNITY:  But you know something?  Eric, I have been brutalized by the mainstream media.E. TRUMP:  I know.HANNITY:  I'm a commentator.E. TRUMP:  I know.HANNITY:  I say I'm a conservative.  I'm supporting your dad for president.  I'll proudly pull the lever for him.  But NBC, CNBC, Univision, CNN, MSNBC fed questions to Hillary!  You know, The New York Times, Boston Globe, Washington Post -- they're colluding with the campaign!  And they're going to criticize me and I'm honest?E. TRUMP:  Yes.HANNITY:  I mean, that -- the -- you've corruption in the Republican establishment, the Democratic establishment, the media establishment.  Your dad's up against a lot of establishment!E. TRUMP:  And by the way, this is corruption of the worst form, and this is corruption that costs this country trillions of dollars.  This is corruption that's cost this country lives.  This is corruption that compromises national security.  I mean, this is real stuff.  I mean, this is real stuff.  This is actions, this isn't words.  And people have to be held accountable.  This is the commander-in-chief of the free world!HANNITY:  How do you hold them accountable but to elect your dad?E. TRUMP:  Well, you know, when you look at the interesting little (ph) complicated webs, right, where you have, you know, the sons and daughters of major -- you know, the CEOs of these major news networks, and they're working at the Clinton Foundation.  You have all these little intricate webs.It's difficult.  And they sew these ties for this purpose.  They do it for their own political gain.HANNITY:  And here's what's happened in the meantime, the stats I give out on the economy...E. TRUMP:  Sure.HANNITY:  OK, 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more in poverty, the lowest labor participation rate since the '70s, 95 million Americans out of the labor force, worst recovery since the '40s, lowest home ownership rate in 51 years, one in five American families, not one person in that family working, and we've doubled the debt.E. TRUMP:  Sure.  And they don't want to report that.  (INAUDIBLE) report that.HANNITY:  I see it every night.E. TRUMP:  How about the scariest thing, the fact that median incomes in this country haven't gone up in 15 years.  Median incomes haven't gone up, and actually, Sean, they've gone down because if you think about it, all of our expenses are higher, right?   Our taxes are higher.  Our utilities are higher.  Health care, ObamaCare is a disaster.HANNITY:  ""Obama care"" is up $4,100 per family since he's the president.E. TRUMP:  And to think about that -- so if you have median incomes -- if people haven't gotten a raise in this nation in 15 years, and all of your expenses are higher, it's no wonder why people are working two and three jobs just to try and get back.HANNITY:  You know that there was a stat that came out the other day, one in seven Americans don't have a thousand dollars in savings!  They're two paychecks away from being one of the 13 new million Americans on food stamps!E. TRUMP:  Yes.  And we have $20 trillion worth of national debt, which is going up exponentially.  We've got $1.4 trillion in student debt.  I mean, it's -- it's really incredible.HANNITY:  How does the country absorb all of this in 27 days?E. TRUMP:  Oh, listen, I think we've started an amazing movement.  My father started an amazing movement.  I mean, I -- literally, I've been in every single state.  I just got back from Colorado yesterday.  I had an amazing couple days there.  I was in Maine.  I was in New Hampshire.  I was in everywhere.  There's a movement out there, Sean.  People get it.  People want...HANNITY:  You can see the crowds.E. TRUMP:  People want this country...HANNITY:  (INAUDIBLE) enthusiasm.E. TRUMP:  People want this country back.  They're sick of corrupt politicians.  And that's what we have in Washington, D.C..  You see these -- you see these closed door deals.  Look at this Russian uranium deal.  Hillary approves 20 percent of the United States' uranium going to Russia.  I mean, this is the material used to make nuclear weapons.  And then the Clinton Foundation gets $145 million for it!  I mean, talk about compromising national security!  It's scary stuff.E. TRUMP:  When you think of Hillary saying these two things, you need a public and private position, and she doesn't like the everyday Americans.  That to me says everything you would need to never get elected!E. TRUMP:  Well, then she also says, Listen, I'll be the hardest person in the world on Wall Street.HANNITY:  Yes!E. TRUMP:  But then she goes to Wall Street and says you'd be the perfect person to solve Wall Street's problems.  HANNITY:  But they paid her $225,000 for that speech.E. TRUMP:  Amazing.  And by the way, when you're an employee of the government, when you're secretary of state, shouldn't you be working on behalf of the people of this country as opposed to giving paid speeches?  If you're giving hour long paid speeches, you need to prepare, you need to travel, you need to do everything else.  Don't you think that's a distraction for your job?  HANNITY:  How about 55 percent of the people got to see her as secretary of state were donors to the foundation?  That's called pay to play.  And then the Haiti Foundation you talked about, they literally separated a list for donors so they could capitalize on the rebuilding of Haiti.  E. TRUMP:  I ask a question every single day.  They came out of the White House, Bill and Hillary claimed they were, quote-unquote, ""dead broke.""  Now they are worth a quarter of a billion dollars.  And the question I always ask was what product did they sell?  How did they go from zero to $250 million?  What product were they selling?HANNITY:  Nothing.  E. TRUMP:  And by the way, when you ask that question, I think a lot of people understand what was really happening there and it's very, very sad.  HANNITY:  Eric, good to see you, buddy.  E. TRUMP:  Good to see you, Sean.HANNITY:  It's 27 days.  Are you ready?  E. TRUMP:  We'll get it.  We're going to get it.  HANNITY:  Up next tonight on Hannity.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  WikiLeaks also shows something I've been warning about for a very, very long time.  The media is simply an extension of the Clinton campaign.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Donald Trump blasting the mainstream media for their obvious biased coverage.  This after WikiLeaks now exposes just how leftwing and how the press is colluding with the Clinton campaign.  Sheriff David Clarke, Larry Elder, Reverend Darrell Scott all coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)TRUMP:  The Hillary Clinton documents, have you been seeing this, what's going on?  Released by WikiLeaks documents make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in November.  And by the way, these dishonest people, mainstream media, they don't talk about this.  WikiLeaks also shows something I've been warning about for a very, very long time.  The media is simply an extension of the Clinton campaign.  Reporters who work for these outlets like the Washington Post or the New York Times may think of themselves as journalists, but they're actually cogs for a corrupt political machine.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Donald Trump earlier today talking about the WikiLeaks email dump, and it clearly shows, yes, he was right all along, and I've been right all along.  Remember I said in 2008, journalism is dead in America.   You see it here, the mainstream media in the tank with Clinton, the depth, beyond anyone's imagination.Here with reaction, Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke is with us, radio talk show host Larry Elder, and the CEO for the National Diversity Coalition for Trump, Reverend Darrell Scott.  Larry, it's everything you and I talked about and have known for years.  NBC, CNBC, CNN, let's see, Univision, MSNBC is fed questions, CNN feeds questions ahead of time, The New York Times, Washington Post, Boston Globe. They are an extension.  They are Clinton campaign.  It is so corrupt at a level that nobody really believed I guess until now.  LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONAL SYNDICATED HOST:  And Sean, something else that you and I have been their talking about for 30 years which was revealed in these emails, the one between John Podesta and Hillary.  For whatever reason they're talking about why some groups succeed, like Jews and Hindus and Chinese, and why others don't, like blacks and Muslims.  And what they say is blacks and Muslims will not be successful irrespective of circumstances, their expression.  And what they're really saying is what you and I have been saying for a long time, and that is to be successful is about drive and hard work and self-sacrifice and not blaming other people.  That's what they believe.  But what they tell you that you are being oppressed by systemic racism, structural racism, institutional racism, therefore we're going to have a program for you, whether it's a set aside or Head Start or Affirmative Action.  They're laughing at you behind your back, recognizing that these programs are nothing more than instruments designed to get votes for us but not designed to make you succeed.  It is insulting what they have been saying all along.  It's what George Bush called the soft bigotry of low expectations.  They are lying to black people, telling them they're victims while behind your back recognizing that success is about hard work and drive.  HANNITY:  And it's more than that, Sheriff.  There is a legal aspect to all of this, and that is the collusion that we now know that went on with the Department Justice giving heads up to the Clinton campaign during an investigation, the White House working together with the Clinton campaign on talking points.  The level of collusion I think would put all four of us in jail, but there won't be the investigation that we probably need.  (LAUGHTER)SHERIFF DAVID CLARKE, MILWAUKEE COUNTY:  Without a doubt.  Look, the words ""ethics"" and ""journalists"" should never be used in the same sentence.  The corruption abounds.  All of our institutions of government have been infect by this corruption.  And to put Mrs. Bill Clinton in office would only continue it and would probably deepen it.The United States Department of Justice is corrupt.  When the attorney general, Loretta Lynch, meets Bill Clinton on a tarmac days before they make the decision not to charge Mrs. Bill Clinton with a mound of evidence of criminal activity, when Eric Holder wouldn't turn over papers to Congress that he was supposed to do by law, and he's the only attorney general to be found in contempt of congress.  You look at the IRS with what is going on this with the attacks on conservative 5013-Cs.  It goes on and on.  Lois Lerner, the head of the IRS, they just thumb their nose at the rule of law.  The law only pertains to you and I and the little guy, the everyday guy, but it doesn't apply to them.  This is very dangerous.  This is very disheartening.  The courts are corrupt.  Aspects of Congress are corrupt.  It is all throughout the federal government.  Only Donald J. Trump gives a chance to break up this Washington cartel and return power back to the states, to the people.  HANNITY:  As a pastor, Reverend Scott, when we see John Podesta is discussing infiltration of the Catholic Church, remember, these are people that can't say ""radical Islam"" interestingly, and we can't have any surveillance of controversial mosques.  But they want to infiltrate Catholic Church with their progressive ideology for the purpose of fomenting a revolution.  Wow.  REV. DARRELL SCOTT, NATIONAL DIVERSITY COALITION FOR TRUMP:  To be honest, Sean, I'm amazed but not surprised.  The bible speaks of deeds being done in darkness being brought to the light.  And these are dark deeds that are being brought to the light.  If Donald Trump's campaign has done anything, it exposed this corruption that exists not only in those upper levels of government but filtering down to the media as well.Like you said, she won't say ""radical Islamic terrorist.""  Do you see she wouldn't say it no matter what said to her during the debate, she would not say those words?  But they talk about our faith and they downgraded Catholics and evangelicals.  Those are the real bigots.  We see who the real bigots are.  Hillary Clinton is a bigot, and she's a bigot that tries to play the race card.  But she's the one that's guilty.  She looks down on blacks.  She is anti-Christian, anti-evangelical, anti-Catholic.  She is all of these things.  But if she can somehow infiltrate them or seduce or hoodwink us into using us for her purposes, then so be it.  HANNITY:  Thank you, guys.  Coming up next tonight right here on ""Hannity.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, ""THE VIEW"":  ""I would like to apologize to those tramps that have slept with my husband.""  Maybe she could have said that.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  ""The View's"" Joy Behar calls Bill Clinton's accusers tramps?  She did apologize later for those remarks.  Why wasn't she fired?  Up next we'll get reaction from Carrie Prejean and Taya Kyle as we continue.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  And welcome back to ""Hannity.""  So earlier this week Joy Behar sparked outrage after she made this comment on ""The View"" about Bill Clinton's accusers.  Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I wonder if she missed the opportunity to address it in a way that the public would understand that that is just not how you behave.  BEHAR:  ""I would like to apologize to those tramps that have slept with my husband.""  Maybe she could have said that.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  The next day Joy Behar backed off and apologized for her crude joke.  Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BEHAR:  During the political conversation yesterday, I made a joke, and I want to apologize.  I never, ever intend to belittle sexual assault or the women who are victims of it ever.  But I made a joke.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Here now, former Miss California USA 2009 Carrie Prejean as well as FOX News contributor Taya Kyle is with us.  Good to see you both.          I listen to this and I'm like, seriously?  Really?  These are women that was exposed by Bill Clinton?  Another groped and grab asked fondled, another accusing rape, and you're going to call them a tramp?  Oh, I'm sorry.  TAYA KYLE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think there's a kneejerk reaction, and the kneejerk reaction is protect your candidate.  Instead of just being honest with yourself and honest about the candidate, we're all flawed people, and saying, you know what, she could have easily just said he's kind of a scoundrel that way, but I don't care.  I still like his politics, you know what I mean, that would be an honest answer.  But to act like it doesn't matter and make a joke and try to crucify somebody else for the same thing, that's where it gets tough.  I just wish people would be honest about how they feel.HANNITY:  Carrie, one of the things, look, nobody defended Donald Trump's comments on ""Access Hollywood."" He apologized.  He said I'm embarrassed.  I'm ashamed.  He did it the right way, fine.  We all, as Taya points out, nobody's perfect.But there's a big difference between saying something, locker room talk, and dropping your pants in front of a woman if you're the attorney general of a state, or having sex in the Oval Office and lying about it, or assaulting women.  Those are actions the media as we now know in the back pocket of the Clintons, they never wanted to talk about that.  Donald Trump had to do the vetting himself.  CARRIE PREJEAN BOLLER, MISS CALIFORNIA USA 2009:  Right, Sean.  You know, it's good to be with you tonight.  It's like Donald Trump said the mainstream media is just an extension of Hillary Clinton.  And people are waking up, Sean.  I am a young mom of two little kids, I'm a Christian woman.  And do you want to know what we care about that the left doesn't want to talk about?  We care about jobs.  We care about a president that is going to put the American people first.  We care about securing our border.  We care about our education for our children.  We care about the Supreme Court justices.  Our founding fathers in 1776, Donald Trump is right, they would be rolling over in their graves, Sean if they knew what was happening right now.  And you know what, the most important thing is the Supreme Court justices as me, as a young mother, that is the most important thing.  And everyone needs to wake up and realize that the American dream is over if that is the case.  HANNITY:  You were a victim, by the way, of this collusion with the media and Hillary.  You were a victim of it.PREJEAN BOLLER:  Right.  And it's just interesting to see.  I knew about this a long time ago, Sean, almost 10 years ago.  I knew about the biased media on the left.  It's a shame that it's happening to Donald Trump.  I am so proud of him.  He is stronger and standing taller than ever and he is not backing down.  And I think that the American people, the people who are voting are going to realize that this is the only person, Donald Trump is the only one that is going to expose the corruption of the left and the media, and only one that is going to turn this country around.  HANNITY:  Taya, do you think most people see the double standard and the difference between words and actions?  KYLE:  No I don't.  In fact I was talking to people who were very left leaning and Hillary supporters last night.  And I wanted to just have that brave dialogue with them and I wanted to understand a little bit more.  And they were adamant that Trump was doing actions and that Bill Clinton, it was all consensual.  And they were adamant about that.And all I wanted to do is talk about, are the problems with Hillary, do they concern you?  Her ethical stance on things and her ability to be above the law, does that concern you?  Leave Trump out of the conversation and just explain to me about that.  But it always came back to defending the candidate and attacking another candidate.  And I feel like that is going to be a major problem for us.  At the same time, character-wise, we're in a place.  We almost have to say forget character because nobody has a perfect character.  Just go on the policy.  HANNITY:  Words and actions are really different.  KYLE:  Right.  PREJEAN BOLLER:  They're completely different.  KYLE:  And Hillary --PREJEAN BOLLER:  You can't compare the two.  HANNITY:  She was part of the slander and the smears and the besmirching and the cover up.  PREJEAN BOLLER:  What about that innocent 12-year-old little girl?  What Hillary did to her is just --HANNITY:  I have them on the program tomorrow night, she will be here, Kathy Shelton.  All right, guys, I've got to go.  Thank you.  And when we come back, a very important ""Question of the Day."" It involves you and the media and the incestuous relationship they have, straight ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  And welcome back to ""Hannity.""  Time for our ""Question of the Day."" Do you think the mainstream media is trying to get Hillary Clinton.  We actually know the answer to that question because of WikiLeaks.  Let's see, ""The New York Times,"" ""The Boston Globe,"" NBC, Univision, CNN, they are colluding.  They're basically all an extension of the Clinton campaign.  But if you want to weigh in on the other side, feel free.  Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you think.  Quick programming note, be sure to tune in tomorrow night, 10:00 eastern.  We will do what the media won't do.  I will speak with three of Bill Clinton's accusers, Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Paula Jones, and I'll interview a woman named Kathy Shelton.  She was allegedly raped at age 12.  Hillary Clinton defended the man accused of sexual assaulting Kathy.  And when you hear Hillary laughing and bragging about what she did, it will shock your conscience.  All four women right here in New York tomorrow night.  You don't want to miss that show.  Nobody else in the media will do that show.  We'll do it for you.  Thanks for being with us.  See you back here tomorrow night.    Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST, ""THE KELLY FILE"":  Breaking tonight.  Senator Ted Cruz of Texas may be facing his very own Alamo, as he and Donald Trump go all in over a prize that could finally decide who is the Republican nominee for president.  Welcome to THE KELLY FILE, everyone.  I'm Megyn Kelly.  The Cruz campaign firing up supporters in Indiana today with a big announcement, confirming that Senator Cruz has picked Carly Fiorina as his choice for a running mate.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARLY FIORINA, R-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Today I am very proud and very humbled and honored to announce that I have accepted Senator Ted Cruz's offer to be his vice president for the Republican nomination.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Miss Fiorina will be joining us later this hour for her very first prime-time interview since the announcement today.  And the stakes for her team could not be any higher.  Trump is holding a slight lead in the Real Clear politics average of all polls from the state of Indiana.  And if Cruz does not win the 57 delegates up for grabs in less than a week there, the political analysts are saying Donald Trump will effectively become the Republican nominee for president.  We're speaking tonight with former Romney campaign strategist Stuart Stevens and Trump adviser Senator Jeff Sessions.  And we'll go live as well to Indiana and hear right from the voters when pollster Frank Luntz joins us with his focus group live.  There they are.  But first, let's speak with the man behind the Alamo analogy who is Tom Bevan, co-founder and publisher of RealClearPolitics.com.  Tom, good to see you.  Why do you say that?  Explain the stakes for Cruz in Indiana.  TOM BEVAN, REALCLEARPOLITICS.COM CO-FOUNDER AND PUBLISHER:  Well, he was mathematically eliminated last night, Megyn.  I mean, this is it.  KELLY:  Meaning he can't get to 1237 just by voters prior to June 7th.   BEVAN:  Correct.  And so really if you do the math and you look at the contest from here on out, the only realistic chance of stopping Donald Trump from getting to that 1237 number is Cruz winning in Indiana next Tuesday.  And he's within striking distance but even that might not be enough.  Depending on how the rest of the contest place out.  But it all starts next week.  If Cruz cannot beat Trump in Indiana, it's going to be over.  I think Trump will easily get to 1237.   KELLY:  How does Indiana decided the votes?  I mean, is it winner take all? Is it?  How does it work?BEVAN:  It's three per Congressional districts, nine districts so 27 that way.  And also then 30 for the winner whoever wins statewide.  So, it's really important that Ted Cruz wins statewide and he wins as many Congressional districts as he can and takes the lion's share of those votes if not sweeps them all.  I mean, that's obviously the best case scenario for him.   KELLY:  He's doing everything he can.  He has this alliance with Kasich in which Kasich basically pulled out all of his resources out of Indiana and left it to Cruz and Trump.  How does he look there, Cruz, right now? Because last poll showed Trump up I think eight points in Indiana.  BEVAN:  Yes.  I mean, Fox news poll that came out, we had three points that came out in the middle of last week, and they had Trump on average up six points, 39 to 33.  And we're dying for some new numbers to see because this pact was announced on Sunday.  So we don't know.  In that Fox News poll, interestingly, though, they did -- you guys did a matchup just Trump against Cruz without Kasich.  And that was two points, it was 46-44.  One of the other problems, Megyn, is that people have been able to early vote in Indiana since the beginning of the first week of the month.  And more than 140,000 votes have been cast, about 68 percent of those are Republican.  And a lot of those folks or at least some of the folks have already cast their vote for John Kasich.  And so if this race comes down to a few thousand votes that could end up being a deciding factor.   KELLY:  You know, obviously Trump has the momentum, you know, with his five-state sweep last night and New York State the week before.  But a lot of people say that Indiana is more tailor made for Cruz than it is tailor made Trump.  What say you?BEVAN:  I say it's pretty evenly divided.  I mean, certainly without question it is better suited for Ted Cruz than any of the states that he's had since Wisconsin.  But even then, though, you know, Trump is splitting evangelicals in the state.  Cruz is winning among the more conservative self-identified more conservative voters.  But it's neck in neck there I think.  And again, momentum and context matters and so we'll see if we get some new numbers hopefully in the next 24, 48 hours how that plays into, you know, where this thing is headed next Tuesday.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.  You've got to check out RealClearPolitics.com.  It is like numbers, numbers.  They put the numbers together and explain them.  Great to see you, Tom.   BEVAN:  Thanks, Megyn.   KELLY:  Joining me now with more, Stuart Stevens, former Mitt Romney campaign strategist and author of the upcoming book, ""The Innocent Have Nothing To Fear.""  Stuart, good to see you.  STUART STEVENS, FORMER MITT ROMNEY CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST:  Thank you.   KELLY:  I mean, it is -- Indiana is a make or break state for Ted Cruz.  He cannot lose there, correct?STEVENS:  I agree with that.  I think psychologically it's important numerically it's important.  And you put them together and, you know, it's the big enchilada for him.   KELLY:  So, if this, if you understand that.  If the Never Trump movement understands that, and they are also motivated, what did they do to make Indiana like Wisconsin but it doesn't have the talk radio to sort of make those inroads.  They don't have a governor yet who is endorsing Cruz.  How do they make Indiana look like Wisconsin?STEVENS:  You know, I think the question that I would try to pose is who can best represent the values of Indiana?  Who is someone you would vote for if they were running for governor of the state of Indiana?  And to me, that matchup is something that Ted Cruz wins.  I mean, he's just someone you could see more likely to win a Republican primary for governor in the state of Indiana than Donald Trump.  I would try to localize it to bring it back to who would make you most proud to represent our state?  KELLY:  Uh-hm.STEVENS:  That, to me, I think is something that when it exists in these races Donald Trump doesn't do as well in certain states.  When it doesn't, when it's missing, it seems to play to his favor.  It wasn't there in South Carolina.  It was there in Iowa.  You look at these states that just voted yesterday.  These are states that you could pretty well imagine Donald Trump getting elected governor in pretty easily.  I think that's less true for Indiana.  But conversely, if he pulls out a win, if Trump can win in Indiana, I think it will be significant.  KELLY:  What do you make of the Trump we've been seeing over the past few days?  Because originally the reports where Trump was going to be more presidential.  And then, you know, it was kind of like, hmm, I don't want to.  I want to just be me.  It's worked for me so far.  And then last night he took a shot at Hillary Clinton suggesting if she were a man she'd have five percent in the polls which has caused some controversy.  STEVENS:  Right.  Well, I think we should step out of politics and look at our experience in life.  If all of us had a friend who was marrying a 69- year-old man and there were a lot of things you didn't like about him but he said he was going to change, I think our advice to that person would be, you better like what you're getting because the odds that someone at 69 years old is going to change is not great.  Donald Trump is not going to change.  He is who he is.  You have to like what you're getting.  And just the idea that you can get different advisers that can help him tactically. I think Paul Manafort has helped that campaign tremendously.   KELLY:  It appears to have been pushed off a little to the side.   STEVENS:  Well, you know, campaign struggles.  You have one culture that's existed inside that campaign.   KELLY:  But he was the one who was trying to sort of get Trump in line, like this, you can do this thing, and then Trump or, you know, the campaign just said, you know, that's not going to work for us.  We're going to do what we've been doing.  Those are the reports.   STEVENS:  Here's the push and the pull.  They say, we've been successful because we're winning the Republican primary.  That's true.  You are winning a Republican primary.  But you're getting crushed in a general election with the highest negatives recorded since we've started tracking these things.  That's not success.  KELLY:  You know, Brit Hume once told me that when you get older your give a blank meter just changes.  STEVENS:  Yes.KELLY:  He didn't say blank, but you can fill it in.  It just changes.  And you can get more honest and you just -- anyway, Stuart, great to see you.   STEVENS:  Good to see you.   KELLY:  Joining us with his thoughts on that, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama who is chair of the Trump National Security Advisory Team.  Great to see you, Senator.  So, let's just start with Stuart's last point because I actually just looked into that.  It is true that Trump has the highest negatives for a GOP front-runner since the beginning of tracking, since they started tracking that kind of thing back in the '70s.  So does he need to do something a little different at this point?SEN. JEFF SESSIONS, R-ALA., CHAIR, TRUMP NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISORY TEAM:  Well, you know, he's been himself.  He's been Frank.  And his vote totals continue to rise.  He's had tremendous victories carrying every county in five states.  I don't think I've seen something like that in many years in this kind of contested environment --    KELLY:  But Stuart's point is -- the Republican he's killing it.  But you have to look at the general at this point.   SESSIONS:  Well, he's been subjected to this incredible negative advertising for months and months and months and it's really not working. He is getting stronger.  And I think he'll continue to get stronger.  And as more people realize what he's doing, he's defending American working people, he's going to fix and fight back against unfair trade policies, he's going to make sure we have a foreign policy that serves the national interest, he's going to end illegal immigration.  He's going to fix this border.  And he's going to protect American jobs.  That's what people have been asking for.  That's the kind of leadership they want.  That's what the Republican establishment had refused to give.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.SESSIONS:  And so this next election is going to be a big deal, and Indiana people are going to vote.  Not politicians.  Not the establishment.  They're going to decide who wins Indiana and who becomes the next president.  It's going to be the American people.  He's doing pretty well right now.   KELLY:  Trump had a big night here in the northeast last night, a five- state sweep with big margins.  And today Ted Cruz who is not a dumb man. Everyone can agree Ted Cruz is smart, announced a running mate.  Now, he doesn't have the nomination yet but he announced the running mate Carly Fiorina who is going to be here with us exclusively here in a moment.  What do you make of that move and the selection of Carly Fiorina?SESSIONS:  Well, I think it's a very unusual and surprising, but I guess when you're behind and you're facing a critical election like Indiana and you've got to maneuver with Kasich to try to beat Trump and block the people's choice so far, then this is -- he's going to make a try.  Maybe it's a desperate move.  Maybe it will work.  It will be decided by the people of Indiana.   KELLY:  What do you think of her though?  I mean, you know, it neutralizes-- I'm guessing the thinking is she helps neutralize the gender history that would be made on the other side.   SESSIONS:  You know, Megyn, I don't know how to figure all of that.  People have their own perspectives.  I would just say that right now it does appear Trump is doing well in Indiana.  It will be a big election coming up next week.  And we'll see how it comes out.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.  Senator, great to see you.  Thanks for being here.   SESSIONS:  Thank you.   KELLY:  So the folks that could decide it all, as you may have gathered, are the voters in Indiana.  And up next, we will go live to Indianapolis where Frank Luntz will poll those voters.  There they are!  On what they're going to do next Tuesday.  Plus, new reports suggest that Senator Marco Rubio may play a surprise role before this is all done.  And Dana Perino and Chris Stirewalt are here on that.   And then Carly Fiorina was the big story today.  There she is live, and we'll have her in moments for a prime-time exclusive.  Stay tuned.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  She is someone you can be confident in if the occasion should arise to be commander-in-chief and keep this country safe.  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Breaking tonight.  In just the last 24 hours, we have seen reports that the Cruz and Trump campaigns along with various political action groups have committed to spending more than $4 million on political advertising just this week in Indiana.  The vote's on Tuesday.  And you can bet that number is going to grow.  Tonight we're going live to a special Frank Luntz focus group to hear what the voters in Indiana think about these candidates and the critical role that now falls to them.  Frank, take it away.  FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER:  Megyn, they're excited to be here and they're excited to be the decision makers.  First question for you all, you're aware obviously of the Kasich/Cruz compact, correct?  By a show of hands, how many of you are bothered by it?  That's an awful lot of people.  What's the problem?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's backroom deals.  They don't really care about what's going on with us, the voters.  LUNTZ:  But isn't it just like what politicians do to help themselves get elected?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And that's why we don't want them.   LUNTZ:  You have a problem with it, Jessica?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They really, if they were going to do this, they should have done it a long time ago.  If they were really going to stop him, it's way past time to do that.   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It looks desperate.   LUNTZ:  It looks desperate.  How does it look desperate?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Again, if they were going to do this, they should have done it a long time ago.  Now it looks like they're just grasping at straws.   LUNTZ:  In the back?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're supposed to be the Republican Party and these two people on the guy's team are coding against him to knock him out?  What's with that?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Including against the will of the voters, in my opinion.   LUNTZ:  That's pretty strong.  Do you think they don't care about you?  Do you think these candidates care about you?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.  They care about themselves.  LUNTZ:  But they've been campaigning and they've been spending money and they've been engaged and they all were here today.  And you don't think they care about you?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You have to take out of consideration what these men have done in the past from their time fighting for the constitution, fighting against ObamaCare, fighting against amnesty.  You have to negate all of that to say they don't care about us.  They took on the entire Washington establishment for us.  For the last several years.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  But if everyone is fighting and fighting and fighting, then we find that nothing gets done.  So, you know, that's one of my fears, that if we get someone in there that cannot get along with anyone, then we're going to end up with the dysfunction that we have right now.   LUNTZ:  And who do you fear the most that can't get along?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ted Cruz.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ted Cruz.  LUNTZ:  Go ahead.   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  Donald Trump knows how to make a deal, and he's talked about compromise.  And that's just the way you have to do it.  We've watched Cruz do nothing.  We've watched Kasich side with the establishment. We want someone to represent us.  And Trump will do it.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Kasich was in the Bill Clinton White House.  I mean, he -- gosh.  He --  LUNTZ:  As a member of Congress --  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  As a member of Congress, he balanced a budget under Bill Clinton.  They were in a $5 billion surplus.  That's something that Cruz has not done.  He has not worked with Obama.  In Ohio as governor, he has dropped unemployment.   LUNTZ:  Okay.  We're not doing a campaign commercial here.  Parker, how old are you?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm 19 years old.   LUNTZ:  You're 19.  This is your first vote.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is.  LUNTZ:  Who are you going to cast it for?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm for Ted Cruz.   LUNTZ:  Why?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Because I feel like he's the most consistently conservative candidate out of the whole group.   LUNTZ:  So yours is just ideology.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He is the only constitutional conservative running.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You shouldn't go with anyone else.   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He is the only constitutional conservative running.   LUNTZ:  So, I have to ask, a whole group of you, all of you, who have changed your minds in the last two weeks?  Because that tells us where things are going.  What did you go from?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I switched from Kasich being my number one to probably leaning Trump because Kasich decided not do come to any campaign as if we're not important.  Him and Cruz have combined together for each other's benefit, and not for ours.   LUNTZ:  But he did that for you to support Cruz here.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I was not going to support Cruz as my first choice to start with.   LUNTZ:  Who else switched?  Why would you switch?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I switched from Kasich to Trump because Kasich/Cruz have proven they can't win a national election.   LUNTZ:  Who else switched?  Why did you switch?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I switched because Cruz doesn't tell it like it is.  I think he's lying to me when he's talking to me.  That's how I feel as a person and a voter.   LUNTZ:  So when Donald Trump uses the phrase ""lying Ted"" --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I believe it.  LUNTZ:  You believe it.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I believe it.  LUNTZ:  That doesn't bother you?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What has Ted Cruz lied about again?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, let's start with Iowa when he told everybody all of the Ben supporters that he's going home to Florida and then he ends up winning Iowa, he has never apologized for that.  I mean, come on.  No, he hasn't! No, he hasn't!UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Was there proof that he --  LUNTZ:  Okay.  Hold on, hold on, hold on!  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Was there proof --  LUNTZ:  This is Indiana.  Indiana is respectful, right?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's right. Use your values.  There was never proof that he had any fault in that.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It came from his campaign.  And if he's a leader, he has got to take responsibility.  The buck stops with the leader.  LUNTZ:  Do you guys agree with that?  Go ahead.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here's the thing.  He did apologize.  If you watched the debates -- if you watched the debates --UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, he didn't.   LUNTZ:  In the back, I don't want to have this battle over Iowa because we're here in Indiana.  But I want to make this point, Megyn, which is that even though we are moving towards the final decision of who is going to be the nominee that they are more divided than in most focus groups I have done.  That there is more animosity and I'm wondering whether these people are going to come together.  Are you going to support the nominee?FOCUS GROUP:  Yes.   LUNTZ:  You are.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.  No.   LUNTZ:  There's no issue there?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.   LUNTZ:  Who's the most electable of the three?  Which one is more likely to defeat Hillary Clinton?FOCUS GROUP:  Donald Trump.   LUNTZ:  How many of you say Trump?  Now, you know that Trump is not doing as well in the polls as either Cruz or Kasich.  So why do you think Trump is most likely to win?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think that the media has sabotaged Trump.  I think that they've ran lots of negative ads on him and they've made him into something that he really isn't.  He's not establishment.  That's what I like about him.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Partly going along with what she said, I went to a rally with Trump in Ohio.  And they talked about all of the, you know, the protesters there, it was very respectful.  I sat with all professional people.  I also went to the Greta show tonight.  All professional people.  And I went to the rally last Wednesday.  And again, it was all professional and it was young, old, Black, White.  But the media is portraying a certain type of, you know, blue collar, you know, uneducated voter that goes to the Trump rallies.  And that's not the case.   LUNTZ:  Okay.  So, how many of you think the media is against Trump?  So, on that we all agree.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No.  No.  I disagree.  I firmly disagree.  LUNTZ:  You disagree.  Okay.  Go ahead.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Well, certainly Fox News, I think gives him more time than any other candidate.   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What about CNN?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That is ratings.   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Well, yes, he's good TV.   LUNTZ:  That is what it is.  It's all about ratings.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The reason Trump can do it, Trump is the toughest guy. That's why he can beat Hillary.  He's the toughest of the candidates.  Ted Cruz is a nice guy, but we don't need any more nice guys in the White House.  We need a tough guy in the White House, somebody that is not afraid to say what they think.   LUNTZ:  Go ahead, Angela.   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Trump is winning and I think the main thing is, how can we expect Kasich and Cruz to win when they can't even beat Trump? They have to beat the primaries.  How can they beat Hillary?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  There are numerous polls and numerous conservative pundits out there that have said that Hillary will beat Trump.  And there's--  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One of the things that we believe here in Indiana is in Hoosier values and Hoosier hospitality.  At the end of the day we're all going to walk out of this room and we've got to decide what we're going to do with ourselves, whether we'll going to walk out as friends or enemies.   We're fighting against the same people.  That's why I love Cruz.  He recognizes that.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Absolutely.  LUNTZ:  Okay.  So Carly Fiorina is coming up.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.LUNTZ:  I want a one-word phrase to describe her.   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Inexperienced.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Fierce.   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Tough.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Irrelevant.   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Accomplished.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Sharp.   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Strong.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Outsourcer.   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Brilliant.   LUNTZ:  Who's got a favorable impression of her?  So, most of you.  Would you like her to be the VP?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  LUNTZ:  How many of you would like her to be the VP?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Absolutely.   LUNTZ:  Tell me why very quickly.   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think she's a consistent conservative and I think she's a fighter and I think she will be able to take down a lot of Hillary Clinton's attacks as well as Donald Trump's attacks.   LUNTZ:  And Rebecca?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I like her because it seemed like she really had her finger on what was going on in the Middle East whenever they brought up any kind of -- any talking points she knew what was going on.   LUNTZ:  Final question, how many of you believe that the Republican nominee is going to be defeat Hillary Clinton in the fall?  Raise your hands.  And who believes Hillary Clinton is going to be the next president.  So, clearly most of you aren't reading the polls today.  (LAUGHTER)Megyn, it's a tough group.  It's a tough time here.  They know that it matters and emotions are pretty high.  But I like what Seth said right there, which is I do believe that when this is done they're going to walk out friends, they're going to walk out allies and they're going to back whoever the nominee is.   KELLY:  Good for them.  LUNTZ:  Back to you.KELLY:  Responsible citizens.  They've got a lot to weigh.  Thank you all so much.  And Frank, thank you, too.  Well, breaking tonight, she is the first vice presidential pick of 2016. You can hear the voters in Indiana love Carly Fiorina.  And she will be here right after this break, live on ""The Kelly File.""    Plus, new fallout tonight after Donald Trump goes after Hillary Clinton. We'll show you what has happened after this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she'd get five percent of the vote.  (END VIDEO CLIP)ANNOUNCER:  From the World Headquarters of Fox News, it's ""The Kelly File"" with Megyn Kelly.   KELLY:  And breaking tonight, the first vice presidential pick for 2016 has been called.  Today Senator Ted Cruz announced that he will now share his ticket with the former GOP candidate Carly Fiorina.  Cruz made the big reveal this afternoon to cheers and applause from his Indianapolis supporters.  But it was Carly Fiorina who stole the show, rounding out the event with a widely praised acceptance speech.  Her message?  Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARLY FIORINA, R-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  This, this is the fight of our time.  And I believe Ted Cruz is the man to lead that fight.  And I am prepared to stand by his side and give this everything I have to restore the soul of our party, to defeat Donald Trump, to defeat Hillary Clinton, and to take our country back.    (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Joining me now, Republican vice presidential candidate and the first vice presidential pick of 2016, Carly Fiorina.  Carly, great to see you again.  FIORINA:  Thanks for being with me.  KELLY:  You know this is odd because Cruz doesn't yet have the nomination. And as you pointed out earlier, this whole election has been odd.  But what do you say to those like Trump who say it was a desperation play by Senator Cruz?  FIORINA:  Well, of course Donald Trump would say that.  Donald Trump has been trying to say that Ted Cruz should get out of the race for a very long time.  The only thing is Donald Trump hasn't won this nomination yet, despite so many people in the media just wishing it would all be over and he would be our nominee.  But as I said in my speech, I do think this is about the soul of our party and the future of our nation.  Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are virtually indistinguishable in their positions.  They are virtually indistinguishable in the fact that they have always been insiders to this corrupt system of crony capitalism and selling access and influence.  And he cannot be our nominee.  And if he were to be our nominee, Hillary Clinton would be our president.  And that is a future that I'm not prepared to lay by and allow to have happen.  KELLY:  You know that the polls show, including last night, that some 70 percent of voters in these states say the one who goes into that convention with the most votes and the most delegates should be the nominee even if he doesn't have a majority.  What are they missing?  FIORINA:  Well, first of all, I would say that a majority of Republican voters don't want Donald Trump to be their nominee.  And 1,237 delegates represent the majority of the delegates in that convention.  So if you can't win 1,237 delegates, then you don't have the majority of your party and you can't win.  Of course, as for John Kasich, you can't lose 49 out of 50 times and win.  But Ted Cruz has beaten Donald Trump many times.  Donald Trump had a good night last night, absolutely.  He had a good night the week before, absolutely.  But this isn't over until someone reaches 1,237. And Donald Trump hasn't and, no, close doesn't count.  And I believe Ted Cruz will be our nominee.  KELLY:  How can he be the nominee when the party isn't coalescing behind him either?  You look at the numbers here in the northeast primaries last night.  He failed to break 25 percent in these states.  So his critics say even if they don't love Trump, Cruz isn't getting the party either.  FIORINA:  Well, you know, actually, the party is unifying behind Cruz if you look at the endorsements that he has received.  I think there will be more endorsements coming.  I mean, if you have the endorsements of everyone from Mike Lee and Scott Walker to Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham, that's a pretty broad spectrum of the Republican Party.  What is also true is the majority of Republican voters don't want Donald Trump as their nominee.  And the thing is, Donald Trump tends to win in open primaries, but he tends to lose in closed primaries.  And I thought it was Republicans' job to elect our nominee.  I think the point of today's announcement is to make crystal clear what the choice is.  On the one hand you have Cruz and Fiorina, two proven conservatives, two proven fighters who actually know what this fight is about, our jobs, our prosperity, the possibilities and potential of our nation, our liberties and our security.  On the other hand, you have Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, who are two sides of the same coin, who are the ultimate insiders, who have played this game all their lives.  And I think what Hoosier values means is that people understand that someone's character is revealed in the pattern of their life, not in what they tend to say behind a podium when they're looking for a job.  Hillary Clinton says whatever she has to say to get elected, so does Donald Trump.  The pattern of his life reveals who he actually is.  KELLY:  What do you make of he's being in hot water in some circles for suggesting that Hillary Clinton would be at 5 percent in the polls, if she were a man.  You were famously on the receiving end of a comment Donald Trump made.  FIORINA:  As were you.  As for you.KELLY:  Both of which got him in some trouble, you could make the argument, in the polls and with some voters.  So what do you make of that comment today -- last night that he made about Hillary.  FIORINA:  Well, you know, I think that Donald Trump honestly has trouble with strong people who stand up to him, whether they are men or women.  And I mentioned that the character -- someone's character is revealed in the pattern of their life.  So, I, for example, think that when we had a terrorist attack in Brussels and Donald Trump immediately pivoted to attacking Heidi Cruz, that reveals his character.  And he cannot be our nominee.  KELLY:  Now, the drudge report tonight is raising questions about you that I want to ask about.  They point out that in June of last year, a Ted Cruz affiliated Super PAC gave your Super PAC $500,000 at a time when you were at 2 percent in the polls.  Do you know why that happened?  They're suggesting something strange was going on there.  FIORINA:  Well, you know, the last time I looked what Super PACs do, they're not coordinating with candidates by law, and most Super PACs give to a variety of like-minded candidates.  I think there's been no doubt to anyone who's been watching this race for a long time that Ted Cruz and I are like-minded.  We agree on virtually every position.  We are both conservatives.  We are both fighters who have challenged the system.  So I don't find it particularly unusual, but I don't know the particulars of it.  KELLY:  I'll ask you the last thing.  Of course you, ripped on Ted Cruz in the primary season, as -- I hate to make a big deal about it always happens, that the candidates rip each other to the shreds and then say, welcome to the ticket.  Do you want to take any of that back, that he's too divisive to be president, maybe there was a legitimate question about his Canadian citizenship?  I'll give you the last word on it.  FIORINA:  Well, first of all, I think it's an exaggeration to say I will rip him to shreds.  Secondly, you're right.(CROSSTALK)FIORINA:  In the heat of a basketball game, you make some fouls.  But here's what I would say.  I've been with Ted Cruz for the past seven weeks. I've come to know him well.  What I've come to know is a man who is who he says he is.  He actually believes what he says.  He has practiced what he says.  He has convictions and principles and values that have been consistent throughout his life.  That is not true of Donald Trump.  And it is not true of Hillary Clinton.  And what I see based on the people who get on that bus with us is a guy who unifies people.  He also happens to be a fair amount of fun.  So what I am proud to say tonight is that I'm proud to stand with him in a fight which I think is all about actually the nation and not about Cruz, or Fiorina, or Trump, or Hillary Clinton for that matter.  It's about what works.  And what we know doesn't work is crony capitalism, a corrupt system, and the wealthy, the powerful, and the well- connected who use that system to get ahead.  And that defines Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.  KELLY:  Carly Fiorina, great to see you again.  FIORINA:  Thanks, Megyn.  KELLY:  All the best.  Coming up, Senator Marco Rubio says Donald Trump has his backing if the GOP front-runner secures the nomination.  And where else might that alliance go?  A bespectacled Chris Stirewalt and Dana Perino join us next on that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mr. Trump, yes or no?  MARCO RUBIO, R-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I'm with Donald if he's the nominee, let me tell you why.  Because the Democrats have two people left in the race.  One is a socialist.  America doesn't want to be a socialist country.  And the other one is under FBI investigation.  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Moments ago you heard from Carly Fiorina on her decision to join Ted Cruz's campaign for president.  Now, questions are being raised about another former presidential candidate, Senator Marco Rubio and where his support now stands.  The Senator sparking intrigue, intrigue I tell you, after these remarks about Donald Trump.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUBIO:  Look, let's not divide the party, have someone here who has all these votes, very close to 1237, let's not ignore the will of the people or they're going to be angry.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If indeed it is Donald Trump, will you support him in.  RUBIO:  Yeah, I've always said I'm going to support the Republican nominee. That's especially true now that it is apparent that Hillary Clinton is going to be the Democratic candidate.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Joining me now, Chris Stirewalt, Fox News digital politics editor, and Dana Perino, former White House press secretary under President George W. Bush and co-host of The Five.  Well, that was a ringing endorsement. That's the thing, the Rubio sound bite we just listened to, he sounds more enthusiastic than he has, Chris, more enthusiastic than he has.  Last time it was like, it gets harder every day.  CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR:  You're saying he was more enthusiastic than when he was making fun of Trump's anatomy.  KELLY:  Even thereafter.  STIREWALT:  I know, but that's setting a low threshold.  I think Rubio is probably representative of what you'll see in a Republican Party, for about a third, I think you'll have a third totally to the tune of Trump, dela Trump, dela Trump Trump Trump, and then you have a third that's anti-Trump or a third who will make -- they will withhold their endorsements on the never Trump votes.  Then I think you'll have another third roughly speaking in the middle that will take a position like that, which says I comply, I welcome our insect overlords, and let's talk about how bad Hillary Clinton is.  KELLY:  Marc Thiessen said, will you vote for Donald Trump?  Because he hasn't been a big fan.  He said, like I like to say, I'll walk off that bridge when I come to it.  Dana, do you think there's any truth, any possibility that Marco Rubio is gunning for the VP slot?  DANA PERINO, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY UNDER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH:  I think there are a lot of people who think so, but based on a couple of conversations I had today with people who know him well, they don't think that that is the case.  In fact, it was just a few weeks ago that Marco Rubio was on Mark Lavin's radio show and he said that he thinks that a conservative should be the nominee and that the remaining conservative in the race at that point was Ted Cruz.  Now, he didn't come out and endorse Ted Cruz either, and I don't think that Marco Rubio is gunning to be anybody's vice president at this point.  I think that maybe he's looking beyond, like maybe to the future of whether or not he wants to run again if at all.  KELLY:  Stirewalt, if Rubio wanted to be Trump's VP, let's look down hypothetically for a moment, what could he do with his delegates that would be helpful to Donald Trump?  STIREWALT:  Well, he could start by having more than John Kasich, and he does do that.  But what could he do for Donald Trump or more likely Ted Cruz, I think if Marco Rubio decides to help somebody, I think Dana is 100 percent right, it would much likely be Cruz who is a conservative like Rubio.  I think that's much more likely.  What he can do is he can peel back some round by round, state by state, rules control, whether a candidate can unbind his delegates in that state, Rubio could unbind some first round.  KELLY:  He can't direct them to vote for any candidate.  STIREWALT:  No.  KELLY:  He can free them up to do it.STIREWALT:  Like born free, he can release them into the wilderness.  KELLY:  As free as the wind blows.  OK, Dana, what about Carly Fiorina?  PERINO:  I think there's a couple of things.  I think that if you wanted to change the media narrative for the day, you were able to do that.  Ted Cruz was able to do that.  I think he will benefit from having her on the ticket especially in Indiana.  I shouldn't say the ticket, there is no ticket.  (CROSSTALK)KELLY:  He's 400 delegates behind.  PERINO:  Right, right.  Some have said too little too late.  I said it might be too little too early because it's not quite at that point.  (CROSSTALK)KELLY:  He understands the importance of Indiana.  PERINO:  I think you pick a vice presidential candidate for a couple of reasons, one because you trust them and by all accounts they get along very well.  They're of like mind when it comes to constitutional conservatism. And she can bring a crowd.  I also think that he thinks she can govern. That's a really important pick.  Like if you -- he was right.  Ted Cruz said it's the most solemn decision that you make as a president, that's true.  I think he put a lot of thought into it.  Does it help him in Indiana?  Maybe in terms of getting enthusiasm out there, but I think that 98 percent of the people when they go to vote, they vote for who is at the top of the ticket.  KELLY:  Might happen help in California, too.  PERINO:  A little bit, yeah.  KELLY:  Stirewalt, your thought on Fiorina, and the decision to put her on the ticket.(CROSSTALK)STIREWALT:  It's not a ticket.  It's a slate, it's a slate.  KELLY:  I don't what it is.(CROSSTALK)STIREWALT:  Look, I think from a Trumpian media point of view, good because it broke the narrative for today.  Otherwise, the narrative for today is everybody in the establishment press would have said, Trump, it's happening.  And everybody shut up.  So he broke the spell.  And so that did something.  And the other thing is, they like her.  The Republicans like her.  KELLY:  Yeah.  STIREWALT:  And if you're Ted Cruz, why the heck not?  KELLY:  I have to ask you before I let you go, did you suffer some Hillary Clinton-esque concussion like with the glasses?  You know, when we saw her give the testimony in Benghazi first time around?  STIREWALT:  Whatever concussions I have suffered are not related to the spectacles.  These are a result of pollen and I can't wear contacts.  So it's glasses for you.KELLY:  Mystery solved.  Very debonair.  Great to see you both.  PERINO:  Thank you.  STIREWALT:  You bet.KELLY:  Good to see you both.  See I have Dana Perino here, so I have to tell you a joke really quick because she gave this to me for my children. Why did the chicken fall into the well?  PERINO:  Why?  STIREWALT:  Because he couldn't see that well.  (LAUGHTER)PERINO:  Corny jokes, Stirewalt.  There should be a segment on The Kelly File. Great one.  KELLY:  Moving on, is it Friday?  No.  After putting himself one step closer to the GOP nomination with a sweep of last night's contests, Donald Trump takes dead aim at the presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, questioning how she would be faring if she were a man.  Robert Zimmerman and David Wool are men, so we're going to ask them about that next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she'd get 5 percent of the vote.  The only thing she's got going is the woman's card and the beautiful thing is women don't like her.  OK?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Donald Trump getting in some trouble for that remark, fairly or unfairly?  Robert Zimmerman is a Democratic super delegate.  David Wool is a Trump supporter and attorney.  Good to see you both.  Robert, your thoughts?  ROBERT ZIMMERMAN, CLINTON SUPPORTER:  The issue isn't whether Hillary Clinton is playing the woman's card, it is that Donald Trump is not playing with a full deck.  He has got negatives amongst women voters at 60 percent according to USA Today, 66 percent, Gallup put it at 70 percent.  He's losing national polls against Hillary Clinton between 8 and 11 percent, losing states like Arizona.  And now, Hillary Clinton is tied in Utah and Mississippi.  This candidacy has no message, no principles, and ultimately, the hate-mongers have one card to play, that is called the Trump card.  KELLY:  David?  DAVID WOOL, TRUMP SUPPORTER:  Let's talk about what he said, Robert. Hillary Clinton's unfavorables have skyrocketed over the last year.  They are nearly 50 percent now among women.  You have this e-mail server scandal hovering over her head, dozens of FBI agents investigating that, a potential criminal indictment coming down the pipe.  We don't know for sure.  But that's going on.  Classic Clinton scandal.  And despite that, she just mopped the floor with Bernie Sanders.  She's doing very well. Now, it's safe to say anecdotally speaking, that she's benefiting from the novelty of being the first female presidential candidate.  (CROSSTALK)ZIMMERMAN:  How about being the most qualified candidate ever to run for president?  WOOL:  Let me argue with that.  ZIMMERMAN:  How about being the most qualified person ever to seek the presidency?  (CROSSTALK)KELLY:  Go ahead, Robert.ZIMMERMAN:  And, David, let me just point to you, if you want to look at her standings with women versus Donald Trump in every poll, from the Wall Street Journal to every other polling source, she is beating Donald Trump amongst women by 30 points or 27 points.  (CROSSTALK)KELLY:  Go ahead, David.  WOOL:  When is the election?  The election is six months from now.  What are the issues?  When it comes down to the issues of national security, the border, jobs, Second Amendment, women in the end are going to agree with Trump's core issues.  It's not going to be a matter of gender, this gender versus that gender.  He's got six months to drive that in.  And you're not going to be able to separate people and drive a wedge between men and women.  The reality is Trump has better ideas, Clinton does have the fact that she's a novelty.(CROSSTALK)ZIMMERMAN:  That presidential stature is really working well for your campaign.  (CROSSTALK)KELLY:  Are you suggesting Hillary Clinton's only credential to be president is she's a woman?  WOOL:  No, I'm suggesting that helps her, Megyn.  There are clearly women who will vote for her because she's a woman.  And that's understandable.  I think Trump understands that.  He's saying that gives her a big benefit.  (CROSSTALK)KELLY:  I'll give you the last word.  Ten seconds.  ZIMMERMAN:  Let's be very clear about this.  I Hillary Clinton winning in every poll against Donald Trump, winning by record numbers and states, she's never been competitive in because of her issues.  But, Megyn, as long as you're queen of hearts, we're fine.  KELLY:  Great to see you both.  WOOL: Thank you, Megyn.KELLY:  We'll be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Tomorrow, we'll have Charles Krauthammer and Anderson Cooper.  Oh, yes, from CNN.  They're coming over here to 'The Kelly File.'  Set your DVR right now.  We'll explain tomorrow.  ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, FOX HOST:  Breaking tonight.  We are now less than ten hours away from the next big test in campaign 2016, as voters head to the polls in South Carolina in a race that could cement Donald Trump's role as the front-runner or confirm the establishment's MVP.  Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone.  I'm Megyn Kelly.  At this hour, the candidates are making their final pitches to the people of South Carolina.  We have live pictures coming back now from a Ted Cruz rally in Greenville, South Carolina.  It just started moments ago.  He has a tough fight on his hands, with the latest polling showing businessman Donald Trump the clear favorite in this race.  According to the Real Clear Politics average, Mr. Trump leads the PAC at 32 percent.  Fourteen points ahead of his next closest competitor and it appears there is little to stand in his way.  He has been dogged this week about questions regarding his opposition to the Iraq war.  Mr. Trump has used the issue to point to his good judgment, saying he opposed that war from the start.  But a new, uncovered interview appears to contradict his claim.  Listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I'm the one that said, don't go into Iraq and I said that, don't go into Iraq, 2003, 2004, and before then.  HOWARD STERN, RADIO SHOW HOST:  Are you for invading Iraq?TRUMP:  Yes, I guess so.  You know, I wish the first time it was done correctly.  That was long before the war began, and by the time the war began, I was, you know, I was saying, and I'm on record as saying that we shouldn't go in --   STERN:  But you're not on record at all opposing the war before it began.  There's simply no evidence of that sir.  TRUMP:  Well, there is evidence and I'll find evidence because I was against the war.  By the time the war started, I was against and in 2003 you have evidence that I was against and I've been against it for years.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  And now we have gotten our hands on audio taken just one day after the 2003 invasion in which he spoke to Fox News' own Neil Cavuto and did not seem exactly anti-war.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Well, I think Wall Street's waiting to see what happens, but even before the fact there, obviously taking a little bit for granted, and it looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint and I think this is really nothing compared to what you will going to see after the war is over.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  So far, there's no evidence that this controversy, Trump's fight with the Pope or anything else that has come up this week is changing the significant lead held by Donald Trump.  And yet optimism abounds within both the Cruz and Rubio campaigns, we're told.  We have a big show for you tonight, complete with four of the Republican presidential candidates, including Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, both here to take questions from our Frank Luntz focus group.  In moments, we'll also be joined by Jeb Bush, plus John Kasich is here, as well.  But we begin tonight with Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News digital politics editor.  Rich Lowry, National Review editor and a Fox News contributor.  And Roger Stone, a former Trump political advisor.  Great to see you all.  So we're visiting the O'Reilly studio, which is why we get to have you on the set.  It's great to see you in New York.  CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR:  It's good to be here.  KELLY:  Let's talk about what you expect to happen tomorrow.  You know, based on what you're seeing.    STIREWALT:  Giant Trumpness.  This should be the best Trump yet.  I think in a lot of ways, it's an open primary state, so his coalition of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans can come together in South Carolina.  It should be good for him.  And it should cement his status going into the Southern primaries -- in the beginning in March.KELLY:  Uh-hm.STIREWALT:  This should be a great night for Donald Trump tomorrow.  KELLY:  What do you think, Roger?ROGER STONE, FORMER TRUMP POLITICAL ADVISOR:  I think Trump wins.  I'm not sure what the margin is.  I do think that Marco Rubio is on the move.  I wouldn't be surprised to see Ted Cruz be third.  KELLY:  Really?  STONE:  Yes.KELLY:  What would that do for his candidacy?STONE:  Well, I think it's problematic going into the rest of the Southern states.  I mean, South Carolina is the doorway into the rest of the south.  We put it there in 1980.  Really to help Ronald Reagan and it worked.  And if he can't score there, it's very tough for him going into the Southern states.  KELLY:  You think so, if Rubio comes out in second, let's put it that way.STONE:  Yes.(LAUGHTER)KELLY:  If he comes in the second position --  STONE:  Right.  Yes.KELLY:  You say he's got the establishment crowned?STONE:  Well, and I think at that point Bush collapses and Rubio becomes the establishment candidate.  KELLY:  Is that true?  Do you agree?  STIREWALT:  If Marco Rubio has a second place finish, we'll start to see there is a magic moment that's going to happen in this Republican nominating process, where it will become a referendum on Donald Trump.  It's becoming a referendum on Donald Trump.  I mean, at some point that will take place.  The sooner that it becomes a two-man race and the sooner that second man is Marco Rubio, the sooner that takes place.  Look, I think Jeb Bush and John Kasich and other candidates are aware of their problem, and their problem is voters in South Carolina know that a vote for Jeb Bush is a vote for Donald Trump, because you're prolonging the process that allows Trump to take advantage of a divided field.  KELLY:  But Rich Lowry, let me ask you.  Because is it correct to assume that let's say, if Ben Carson drops out, if even Ted Cruz were to get  out of this race, that their supporters would necessarily go to Marco Rubio over Donald Trump?RICH LOWRY, NATIONAL REVIEW EDITOR:  Some of them would, not all of them obviously, and especially Cruz, there may be more overlap with Trump than there is with Rubio.  But I agree with everything that's been said, and especially if Trump has a big margin tomorrow night, if it's double digits, if it's somewhere in the mid-30s, the head of steam is going to be incredible.  He's going to go in Nevada with major momentum.  And the one poll we have lately out of Nevada has him at 45 percent already.  So, presumably he's going to win Nevada.  And then he's going to go into Super Tuesday having demonstrated in the strength in the south by winning South Carolina, after winning the last three states, after beating Ted Cruz in the south with Marco Rubio never having won a state in this scenario --  KELLY:  Yes. Simply had to win.LOWRY:  And he's going to win eight, nine, ten contests.  KELLY:  I don't know much about politics but simply you have to win.  You can't spin your third place, fifth place, and possibly worst place.   LOWRY:  Yes.  Check it out with Stirewalt before you're certain about that.  But I think you can't finish third constantly and win the nomination.  KELLY:  This is why we pay you guys to tell us these things.  But what about Trump's negatives?  Because even in South Carolina, they're saying 40 percent of the people say they would never vote for him.  And obviously, there's a whole faction of the Republican Party that doesn't want Trump.  He's nobody's second choice.  He's tons of people first choice, right?  So, how does that play?  Because at some point people will going to have to start to realize, he's probably going to be the nominee.  STIREWALT:  So, we've talked about the phenomenon of what I call the Donald Trump's leveraged buyout of the Republican Party in which he has 33 percent to 40 percent of the voting shares.  But the rest of the board can't get behind any single choice.  So, he is able to take advantage.  His whole strategy, everything about Donald Trump, depends on the prolonging the time until the rest of the party says, well, Marco Rubio is not our dream date.  We didn't all want him.  KELLY:  Dream date Marco.STIREWALT:  Right.  We always wanted somebody else.  Exactly.  But we'll take him because he's the best guy to go up against Trump and we think against Hillary.  KELLY:  Divide and conquer.  And he's been doing very well.  Now, speaking of war strategies, he got in a bit of a confrontation with a questioner at the CNN town hall last night who was not happy about Trump's claims during the last debate that Bush lied, President Bush lied about WMDs to get us into the war in Iraq.  Here's the question and exchange.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. ORAN SMITH, PRESIDENT, PALMETTO FAMILY COUNCIL:  When you said that George W. Bush, which was our last Republican president, that he lied to get us in the war in Iraq, that stung me very deeply.  I don't believe that.  I'm just wondering, given some time passing, perhaps you've rethought that, would you be willing to rethink that?TRUMP:  Well, a lot of people agree with what I've said.  And I'm not talking about lying, I'm not talking about not lying, nobody really knows why we went into Iraq.  ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR:  What you said was, they lied, you said, there were weapons of mass destruction, and there were none and they knew there were none, there were no weapons of mass destruction.  TRUMP:  Well, a lot of people think that.  There were a lot of people that look -- bottom-line, there were no weapons of mass destruction.  SMITH:  Do you think the president of the United States, George W. Bush, lied --  TRUMP:  Well, look, I'm not going to get your vote but that's OK -- let me tell you something --   SMITH:  I'm just giving you another shot at it.  TRUMP:  I'll tell you it very simply.  It may have been the worst decision going into Iraq, may have been the worst decision anybody has made, any president has made in the history of this country, that's how bad it is.  OK?  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Rich Lowry, what do you make of that?  Because clearly at the debate he said, they lied, that he lied, and then last night he said, well, a lot of people think that, I don't know.  LOWRY:  Yes.  He's clearly trying to soften it a little bit.  Look, a lot of Republicans feel like that voter who asked that question.  Now, what trump said about the Iraq war is not going to matter to his core supporters -- his core supporters who clearly operate by the Fifth Avenue rule, which is Trump can do anything and they're still with him as long as he's disrupting the system.  But the question is, whether he's building a ceiling for himself and it's going to be hard for him.  Will there be enough resistance in the party to keep him from getting above 50 percent.  KELLY:  What do you make of that last point, Roger?  STONE:  I think it's meaningless.  The first one is the best -- the better position for a general election.  And second, whether it was incompetence or whether it was treasonous, it was an enormous mistake.  KELLY:  But that's a big deal.  That is an important distinction.  STONE:  Doesn't seem to be the Republican voters.  KELLY:  Treason, the T word.  Now you really --  STONE:  Look, I'm not -- as you know, I am not a Bush fan, but I don't think that either charging Bush on 9/11 or charging him on the war has hurt Trump's candidacy in his lies.  Many Republicans agree with him.  KELLY:  Great to see you all.  Thank you.STIREWALT:  You bet.  KELLY:  Also today in Washington, a public display of remembrance and appreciation for a legal titan.  Look at this, long lines of mourners that stretched for blocks and blocks, as well as his beloved family all turned out to honor Associate Justice Antonin Scalia.  His casket carried into the great hall of the U.S. Supreme Court to lie in repose, on the very platform in which President Abraham Lincoln's coffin rested.  His fellow justices there to pay their respects along with an honor guard of his former clerks and his loved ones.  Also in attendance today, the President and the First Lady, and it was Justice Scalia's own son, himself a Roman Catholic priest, who offered a prayer for his father.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PAUL SCALIA, SON OF ANTONIN SCALIA:  God of faithfulness, in your wisdom you have called your servant Antonin out of this world.  Release him from the bonds of sin and welcome him into your presence so that he may enjoy eternal life and peace and be raised up in glory with all your saints.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Joining us now, presidential candidate and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.  Governor, good to see you.  I recognize that the President and First Lady were there, but we've been talking all week about how it will be unprecedented that he will not attend the funeral tomorrow.  Never in history has a sitting U.S. President not attended the funeral of a sitting U.S. Supreme Court Justice.  And the question for you is whether you believe he's shirking his duty as our head of state in not going?JEB BUSH, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I think he is.  He's also the most divisive president we've had in modern history and this is yet another example.  People will look to this and say, he didn't go because he didn't respect the incredible judicial mind of one of the great jurists of all time.  And it's a shame.  The President needs to be a healer rather than a divider.  And every step along the way, this president is gifted as he is, has used his skills to divide the country and we're living in a dangerous times and needed someone who tries to create a unity of purpose.  This is sadly another example of why he's not an effective president.  KELLY:  Let's talk politics for a minute.  Because now you just heard our panel, maybe you didn't, but they suggested that voters in South Carolina now --  BUSH:  Oh, I did.  I heard them.  KELLY:  OK.  So, they were suggesting -- he's talking about Stirewalt.  He's still here.  He has a shameful look on his face.  But he was suggesting that voters in South Carolina are understanding that a vote for you or vote for John Kasich is a vote for Donald Trump.  BUSH:  That's ridiculous.  That is absolutely ridiculous.  And it does a disservice to the people that are working hard and my campaign and does a disservice to the voters of South Carolina.  They should pick who they think should be the person that could beat Hillary Clinton and can lead as president of the United States.  In my case is, that I have a proven record unlike other candidates that I can be commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces and president of the United States on day one.  We're living in dangerous times.  We need someone who has a steady hand and detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.BUSH:  So, with all due respect to the pundits hanging out in New York, I think I'll let the voters of South Carolina decide.  KELLY:  There is a report in Politico tonight that several Jeb Bush campaign workers are shopping their resumes, believing that you will not continue on after South Carolina.  Is that true?BUSH:  With all due respect to Politico, let's let the voters decide this.  I don't read Politico, I think it's trash.  KELLY:  As we sit here on the eve of South Carolina, the voting starting to begin in 10 hours or so.  What is your final message to the voters there?BUSH:  Well, that we can grow our economy at four percent rather than two percent.  That we can restore the military cuts to keep us strong.  That we need a commander-in-chief and president of the United States that will restore America's leadership in the world to keep us safe and that we need someone who will change the culture as I did in Tallahassee to bring about a balanced budget amendment and change the culture so that we can rise up again as a nation.  And people are deeply pessimistic about the future.  They're latching on to the big horse on the stage in the case of the Republican nomination.  But that guy isn't going to solve their problems, I can.  KELLY:  Governor Jeb Bush, thanks for being here.  BUSH:  Thanks, Megyn.  KELLY:  All the best.  Also tonight, a judge has decided to look at the issue of whether Senator Cruz is eligible to be president of the United States.  And we'll show you why he took that on in just a moment.  Plus, Governor John Kasich joins us with the inside story of one of the most powerful moments we've seen this year on the campaign trail.  Plus, we put together a focus group of South Carolina Republican primary voters to get their final thoughts before they vote in just a few hours.  And then we surprise them with Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz who gave them each a rose.  No, it's not that kind of show.  But we will show you what did happened when the questions started flying like this one to Senator Rubio.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Among all the negative ads with the candidates, the one that affected me the most is the one that continues to say that you have not shown up for votes but I have not heard you explain or defend that whatsoever.  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  One new developments in the saga over Senator Ted Cruz's eligibility to be president, as a judge sets an official court date to hear Senator Cruz's side of the story.  This after the complaint was already dismissed by lower body.  Trace Gallagher live in our West Coast Newsroom with the story -- Trace.  TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Megyn, the initial lawsuit filed by Lawrence Joyce, an Illinois pharmacist and attorney, claims that Ted Cruz is not a natural born citizen, is not eligible to run for president, and should have his name taken off the Illinois primary ballot.  Ted Cruz's lawyer filed a motion to dismiss, and now the Cook County Circuit Court will hear the matter on March 1st.  Even though Mr. Joyce is a Ben Carson supporter, he says this isn't about pushing his candidate, it's about saving the Republican Party.  Joyce says, he's terrified that Cruz will win the nomination, be disqualified and the Republican Party will choose an inadequate replacement candidate.  Joyce believes Donald Trump should file his own lawsuit, because Trump has the money and power to pursue it, and because Trump is the one who first brought it up.  Listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LAWRENCE JOYCE, ILLINOIS VOTER:  I made it publicly clear that even though I'm a Carson supporter, he could take my case if he wanted to, because the legal issues are the same for all the candidates.  And I never heard a peep out of him.  So, I'm beginning to wonder if Donald Trump is even sincere in the first place.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER:  Ted Cruz says, quote, ""I have never breathed a breath of air on this planet when I was not a U.S. citizen.  It was the act of being born that made me a citizen.""  And Lawrence Joyce agrees that yes, he is a citizen but argues that because he was born in Canada, he's a U.S. citizen by statute, not a natural born citizen as the constitution declares.  The issue has never been ruled on by the Supreme Court, and is the subject of disagreement by some of the country's most respected constitutional scholars, although we should note the vast majority believe Ted Cruz is eligible to run -- Megyn.  KELLY:  Yes.  And the board of elections has already so held this is an attempt to reverse that decision.  Trace, good to see you.Well, an extraordinary moment on the South Carolina campaign trail yesterday.  Governor John Kasich was speaking to voters when a young man stood up and what happened next has appeared on virtually every broadcast in the nation.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I drove up today from the University of Georgia, and, sorry for you all -- and I did it because I wanted to let you know and let everyone else here know why I'm supporting you and why that support is unwavering.  And I don't want to get too emotional.  But it's pretty serious but has happy ending.  Like over a year ago, a man who is like my second dad, he killed himself.  And then a few months later, my parents got a divorce, and then a few months later, my dad lost his job.  And I was in a really dark place for a long time.  I was pretty depressed.  But I found hope and I found it in the lord and in my friends, and now I've found it in my presidential candidate that I support.  And I really appreciate one of those hugs you've been talking about.  (APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Joining me now, a Republican presidential candidate and Ohio Governor John Kasich.  Governor, it's great to see you.  What a moment that was and to your credit, when you whispered in that young man's ear, you did not lift up the microphone, you had a private moment with him where you shared whatever it is, you shared.  And then you went back to speak to the crowd and talk about what you've learned on the campaign trail when it comes to renewal and human connection.  Tell us now.  GOV. JOHN KASICH, R-OHIO, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Well, you might remember, Megyn, when we did this interview, when I was in New Hampshire I was telling you about these special, private moments that people have felt comfortable coming to, of all things, a political town hall, and talking about things that people really feel deeply about.  I have some guests here tonight.  I'm not going to give you any of the background, but they came to see me, because they have a very serious problem in their family.  And, you know, I think they're seeing most of the candidates, but I've had a little private meeting with them.  And it's just there's something that has struck me about the needs of a people out there who feel disconnected.  And what I've been saying is, we all need to slow down a little bit, put ourselves in each other's shoes and begin to live a life bigger than ourselves, Megyn.  Because, you know, look, we want to elect a president.  But when you grew up and I grew up, we didn't have anybody coming in on a white charger trying to solve all our problems.  A lot of times, we roll up our sleeves, pour ourselves up by our bootstraps and connect with other human beings, because deep inside of us is sort of a notion that we do want to be connected to other people.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.KASICH:  We do want to be able to lift one another.  That's the spirit of America.  That's what we're all about here in the United States of America from the very beginning.  Connectivity, living a life bigger than ourselves and doing it without having to wait for the government to fix our problems.  And the government can help us, Megyn.  Of course, the government has its responsibility, but if we really want to restore the fire to the American spirit, we've got to do it right where we live.  And I know you know that.  KELLY:  That quiet dignity, that love, that connection is a lovely sentiment and heartfelt.  When you look at the American electorate right now, doesn't it feel like it's going a different way?KASICH:  Megyn, they're very concerned.  Look, they're concerned that they're in their 50s and they're going to lose their job, either because the economy is bad or somebody from some other country is going to come in and steal their job by dumping something in this country that we can't compete against.  They're worried about their kids being in a position where, you know, they're not going to have the kind of life that we got from our parents.  But they're looking for hope, they're looking to believe that the story doesn't have to end in a negative.  And I don't believe that it does, Megyn.  I mean, look, we've been through a lot worse times in America than what we're going through now.  And with a little leadership and some good, conservative principles to reignite the economy and to make sure we leave no one behind, I find people very hopeful.  Look, I've done more town halls than virtually everybody put together and I think I've got a pretty good sense of what people want and they want to believe, and they want hope, they want to change and they want to believe that they themselves can help change the world.  I believe it.  KELLY:  Governor Kasich, we are here now on the eve of the South Carolina primary.  The polls put you in fifth or sixth place.  What's the path ahead for you?KASICH:  We're going to go all over the country, Megyn.  Look, when I finished strong in New Hampshire, people said that all the supporters that I would get in South Carolina could fit in a Volkswagen.  Well, I mean, we've done better than that.  We're going to be able to at least put them in a van.  You know?  KELLY:  The family tractor.KASICH:  Yes.  We're going to Vermont, Massachusetts, Virginia on Monday, Mississippi, Louisiana, and we'll compete in Super Tuesday.  We'll be in Michigan, Ohio.  We're going to go all across the country, and, you know, we're going to do better than people expect here, but we never expected to win here.  And it's not critical that we do, but we certainly want the people of South Carolina to give us some support.  KELLY:  You know, not long ago, Rachel Maddow of MSNBC took some hits for getting up and hugging Clinton and Sanders at the end of a debate.  I think it's safe to say that most of the anchors in this building and most of the people watching this show would like to give you a hug right now just like that young man.  Thank you for being here.  It was just a nice moment, wasn't it?  It's just nice to see him connect with that suffering young man who had gotten to a better place, listening to an optimistic message and helping to turn his life around.  In any event, before the voting is done tomorrow, they expect to break records in South Carolina, and we will speak with the state GOP chair tonight about what that means and about what they're seeing in terms of absentee votes coming in already.  What counties they're coming from.  Plus, Marco Rubio goes one on one with the South Carolina voters, next.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You're my number one right now with Trump at close second.  What can you say or (INAUDIBLE) about you or immigration right now?  What can you do real quickly to clarify immigration to make me vote for you?   (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking Tonight, we are less than 10 hours out now from the first votes cast in South Carolina's GOP primary. The ""Kelly File"" put together a focus group of Palmetto State Republicans to get their final thoughts, then we surprised them by bringing in two of the frontrunners, Senator Marco Rubio and Senator Ted Cruz.We recorded the group's reactions in real time, and in moments, those reactions will be displayed on your screen. It will look like this. The red line represents the feelings of the conservatives in the audience. The green line is the moderates. When the lines go up, it means they like what they're hearing, when they go down, not so much. Pollster Frank Luntz ran the deal and we begin with Senator Rubio. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is with great pleasure I introduce the senator from Florida, Marco Rubio.(APPLAUSE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Turn the dial (ph).(LAUGHTER)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Word or phrase to describe Marco Rubio.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Awesome statesman.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Conservative.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Presidential.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Establishment.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bold.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Handsome.(LAUGHTER)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Diplomatic.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I got to ask you, are you married?(LAUGHTER)Are you happily married?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah.(LAUGHTER)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So, that's a pretty good response. Is there anything briefly that you feel that the voters of South Carolina and America haven't heard from you yet that you would want them to know as they make up their minds?MARCO RUBIO, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I'm not sure you haven't heard it yet.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Grab your dials (ph).(OFF-MIKE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And let's -- let's rate Marco Rubio.RUBIO: I'm not sure you haven't heard it yet but I want to reiterate why it is that I decided to enter public service and run for the presidency, and that is that I believe that my generation will either leave our children the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived or we're going to be the first Americans to leave our kids worse off than ourselves and that's what motivates me to do this. That's the reason why I feel so passionate about this.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Marco?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've got three people here who are first time voters. What is your question for him?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My question. One of the greatest passions of mine is sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ everywhere, no matter .UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: . this state, North Carolina, all over the world. Tell me your stance on religious liberty.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm going to do the other two. Your question?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're in my top -- or you're my number one right now with Trump that close second. How -- what can you say or my withdrawals about you or immigration right now. What can you do real quickly to clarify immigration to make me vote for you?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And you're also a first time voter?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mine is about immigration. You say that you don't want to deport the -- like it's impossible to deport the -- to -- or the -- all the illegal immigrants here, but why don't you at least try? Because I mean, they did break the law by coming here illegally and they are taking the American jobs, so why don't you just at least try to deport them?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My recommendation is to go for the undecided guy.(LAUGHTER)RUBIO: Why -- he said that I'm number one, but well, I can go out on the religious liberty. It's not just the liberty to believe whatever you want. It's the ability to live out your faith in every aspect of your life. It's the free exercise, meaning, you know, government should never force you to violate your conscience.(APPLAUSE)I think the two questions were about immigration, and let me just say, number one, I don't believe we can round up and deport 12 million people. I don't think you would support what it would take to do that one when started happening.(APPLAUSE)I do believe that people will have to be deported. The law has to be enforced, and I think we should begin with people that are dangerous and pose a threat. That should be happening now.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Now.RUBIO: And -- and I think, that should be happening now. I mean, people that pose a threat to public safety should be the first ones we prioritize, and that should be happening now irrespective of anything else, and about immigration, I would just say, it's very clear we're not moving to anything on immigration until the American people see that illegal immigration is under control. And not just pass a law. That's what we learned in 2013.Passing a law alone is not enough. They want to actually see the wall built. They want to actually see we'd hire the additional border agents. They want to actually see e-verify in place and they want to see an entry-exit tracking system in place, and it's working because after 1986 when Reagan did it, they never did the enforcement part. And people are saying, we're not going to allow this happen, again, and that's the -- that's exactly why I don't think we can do anything else until that happens first.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Before anybody else?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In the bold act (ph).UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, I want to know why you have supported the Gang of Eight Bill then?RUBIO: Yeah. So, back then in 2013, the Senate was moving forward on immigration reform. And so, what I wanted to do is make it as conservative as possible in a Senate controlled by Harry Reid, sending it over to the House because you can't just pass a bill from the Senate and send to the president and the hopes that the conservative House would make it even better.And if you go back at the time and see my statements, it was very clear. I said it over and over again. This bill is not strong enough. It won't pass this way. The House is going to have to make it stronger, and that's the only way we're going to have a chance to do it. So that's what I endeavored to do is to make it as strong as possible. That isn't the way we're going to do it when I'm president.When I'm president, I can do it our way, not the way they wanted to do it, and that was never going to be the final law, but I wanted to make it as conservative as is (ph) -- and so I wanted to make a difference. I wanted to have an impact on an issue that's still haunts us. We're still facing this issue.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The single -- the -- among all the negative ads with the candidates, the one that has affected me the most is the one that continues to say that you have not shown up for votes, but I have not heard you explain or defend that whatsoever.RUBIO: Why I have almost a 90 percent vote record in my entire time, the five years in the Senate. When just I started running for president, I started missing some votes. For example, votes that past 97 to nothing or votes on a district judge that everyone support or votes that haven't been consequential. When there's been a vote where I can make a difference around a major public policy matter, like funding planned or defunding Planned Parenthood I make those votes.Last week, I took off the campaign and went back to vote on North Korea sanctions. But when you run for president, I can't be in two places at once, and ultimately, I'm running for president. It's because while senators are going to help shape the agenda. Only a president can set the agenda. These bills that we're voting on, Obama is going to veto them. We need a new president, and that's why, I spend time on the campaign trail. I'm not running for re-election for the Senate. I'm either going to be a private citizen or the next president of the United States. I feel that passionately that we need to improve in that office.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's your reaction in his answer?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I love the answer because I know that you've got to work with what you've got to deal with and I want to see you do more when you get to the Senate and .UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But .UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  . I saw you leave Columbia the other day to go back and vote in North Korea.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's your reaction to his answer?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think he's honest and sincere.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One more.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The thing that I love is that you noticed he said, ""I'm not running for re-election for Senate. I'll either be a private citizen."" So, it's not like he's falling back on a job he has. That's why I believe him.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's go. You can teach up Clark (ph).UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Marco, I've got a question for you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I love Jeb Bush .UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: . but I do not want Donald Trump. Should I consider voting for you on Saturday?RUBIO: Well, I honestly believe I'm the only one left in this race that can do two things, and we have to do them both. One is we have to unite this movement. We're going to have -- we'll have a spirited primary, but if we're still fighting with each other in September and October, we're going to lose, and if we lose, that means that Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton are president.And number two, we have to grow this movement. Now, in the past, you know what they've told us we need to do grow this movement. We have to water down our principles, be less conservative. I don't believe that for one second. I believe that we need to take our principles to people that don't vote for us now and I'm going to. I am going to take the things I believe in conservatism to people that are living the way that I grew up, to people that live paycheck to paycheck, to students that have loans, to families raising their children, to first generation Americans, and I'm going to say, ""I lived the way you're living now. I grew up the way you're living now, and I'm a conservative and you should be too. It's right for you. It was right for me and that's what right for America.""UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Reaction?(APPLAUSE)Absolutely.(APPLAUSE)I'm with that (ph).(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: And straight ahead, Senator Ted Cruz does the same, going face to face with the South Carolina primary voters that will decide his fate tomorrow. We'll show you how he did.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TED CRUZ, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Give a word or phrase to describe .UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right. Senator Cruz, you will change my mind .CRUZ: OK.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: . and you'll have my vote if you can answer this question. How, step by step, do you plan on removing ObamaCare?CRUZ: All right. Andy (ph), it's a great question.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Will Senator Ted Cruz was next up in the lion's den. Watch what happened.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ladies and gentlemen, Senator Ted Cruz.(APPLAUSE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Give me a word or phrase to describe Ted Cruz.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Constitutionalist.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Conservative.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Conservative.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Constitutionalist. Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Savvy.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Impressive.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Logical.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Smug.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not all good. Mostly good.(LAUGHTER)Senator, what have you not -- and if you all can grab your dials. This is going to be a discussion.CRUZ: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What if you not had the chance to tell them that would help them make up their minds? How many of you are undecided today? Raise your hands. This is your chance to reach out to about a third of the group. What would you tell them that might convince them that you're the right candidate and everyone grab your dials and let's start reacting.CRUZ: Well, listen, I think the stakes have never been higher than they are right now. I think one of the great things of the people of South Carolina, is you all been looking very seriously at these candidates. You know, this Saturday, when we had the last debate, earlier that day Justice Scalia passed away. And I think it really underscored just how high the stakes are in this election. And what I believe the men and women of South Carolina are looking for is they're asking who can I trust?You know, the Supreme Court right now is hanging in the balance and our basic constitutional rights, our second amendment, our free speech, our religious liberty, every one of them, we're one liberal justice away from that being -- being taken away from us, and what we've seen over and over, again, the Democrats, when they have the white house, they always put left wing activists on the courts. The problem is, Republicans, more than half the time, we mess it up.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you guys agree with that?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We do.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, then why should they trust you?CRUZ: Because I've spent my whole life fighting to defend the Constitution. I spent my whole life fighting to defend the bill of rights.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What question would you like to ask Senator Cruz?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'd like to ask him if things don't work out for the presidential election, I think you would be a fabulous Supreme Court justice.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You guys are great.(APPLAUSE)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Would you accept that when you're nominated?CRUZ: Listen. Thank you, I appreciate this. You got -- you know, look, what I'll tell you, having principled Supreme Court justices is immensely important, but I think our country is in crisis right now. You know, I would like to be in a position to appoint two, three, four, five principled Supreme Court justices. But we also need a president who will -- who will fight to repeal ObamaCare. We need a president who will fight to pass a flat tax. We need a president who's .UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We need a Supreme Court that's going to hold that up. It needs to be .UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: . who did it legislatively .CRUZ: I promise you are preaching to the choir so much. I mean, listen, I've spent almost my entire life practicing in front of the Court. But on foreign policy, we need a president that stands with Israel, that defeats radical Islamic terrorism.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, I'm a veteran myself.CRUZ: Yeah.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My husband is a retiree of the United States Army. What are you going to do to help our Armed Forces .UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: . particularly our veterans?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely (ph).UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.CRUZ: Huge -- hugely important question. We've got to rebuild the military. The weakening of the military under Obama has been absolutely unconscionable. Earlier this week, in South Carolina, I rolled out a comprehensive plan to rebuild the military. To start with Obama has proposed reducing our army down to 450,000 soldiers, that's too weak to get the job done. We're going to rebuild to 525,000 and stand. We're going to take .(APPLAUSE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: With the back quote (ph) of the Supreme Court decision that was made this past summer .CRUZ: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: . how do you see that continuing to affect our religious liberties in the negative way that it already seems to have been doing?CRUZ: Listen, you're absolutely right. The gay marriage decision, it was utterly lawless, it was illegitimate, it was contrary to the Constitution, and as far as I'm concerned, it will not stand.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right. Senator Cruz, you will change your mind .CRUZ: OK.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: . and you'll have my vote if you can answer this question. I have a lot of friends in the medical field .CRUZ: Yeah.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: . and we can all agree that ObamaCare is a cancer, and it is a cancer that needs to be cut out but it needs to be cut out the right way.CRUZ: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you cut it out the wrong way, it's going to absolutely kill the country and kill our health care system.CRUZ: Yeah.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How, step by step, do you plan on removing ObamaCare?CRUZ: Andy (ph), it's a great question.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.CRUZ: I think we got to start by repealing every word of it. But once we do that, we're not done. Everyone agrees we need health care reform. I think health care reform ought to expand competition, ought to empower patients and ought to keep government from getting between us and our doctors. We need to let people purchase health insurance across state lines. We need to expand health savings accounts. We need to make health insurance portable, so it goes with you from job to job.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did he win your vote?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He von the vote.(APPLAUSE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's great (ph), excellent.(APPLAUSE)One last question, we're going in the back center, you're up.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A lot of people I know are scared of you. I had a friend next to me who just -- I know -- thought it was rather ridiculous, but she did say, she thought if you wanted to be theocracy. How are you going to convince moderates .CRUZ: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: .and independents that you're not going to, you know, turn the country into a theocracy or anything, you know, so right winged that they get crazy about it?CRUZ: Well, listen, one of the things the media does is they try to paint anyone who is actually a Bible-believing Christian as a nut.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Amen.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Amen.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you guys agree with that?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.CRUZ: And so, it's wrong. Listen, I am a Born Again Christian, it's who I am. It's integral to who I am, and I'm not going to hide my faith. I'm not going to be ashamed of Jesus.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's right.CRUZ: But -- but, you know, I'm .(APPLAUSE). at the same time, I'm not running to be pastor in chief. My dad is a pastor. But it's not the job of a president or candidate or a president to be the pastor. It is the job of the president to be the leader for everyone, and I think the answer you can give your friends more than anything is that I am a constitutionalist, and the bill of right protects everyone, religious liberty.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.CRUZ: It protects Christians. It protects Jews. It protects Muslims. It protects Hindus. It protects atheists. I mean, this is a nation where we have a right to follow our conscience, our religious faith to seek out God.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you guys agrees with that?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.(APPLAUSE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ladies and gentlemen, Senator Ted Cruz.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Up next, the chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party on why he is predicting something historic in tomorrow's vote. Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Well, our South Carolina Focus Group also spoke about the election and one voter was not happy that Donald Trump is threatening to sue Ted Cruz over his eligibility to run for president.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He can take it. He's a - he whines as much as Jeb Bush does when he -- when it's -- when it turned against him.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And they're his words.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And they're his words.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It doesn't matter but let him come out .UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, 30 years ago, Trump (ph) .(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: . and prove now that he's changed.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's not a politician. He's not a politicianUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Excuse me -- oh, excuse me, he's a real politician.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Reagan was a politician.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He knows how to fight power .(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What are about to drive .(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Campaign.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's not. No.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's a politician.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Although .(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: South Carolinians are fun. Matt Moore is chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party. Matt, you say this is -- this race has not been too harsh down there. That's a par (ph) for the course in South Carolina.MATT MOORE, SOUTH CAROLINA REPUBLICAN PARTY CHAIRMAN: What a great country, Megyn. I think tomorrow we'll see record turnout on our side. About 650,000 people here in South Carolina. About double New Hampshire and Iowa combined.KELLY: What was it last time?MOORE: This is a big important for me .KELLY: What was it four years ago in the GOP primary?MOORE: It was 600 -- and 603,000 people voted in South Carolina last time. I think -- we've seen gigantic (ph) so from media metrics or Facebook accounts just through the route (ph) people are interested in this primary in South Carolina.KELLY: All right. Absentee ballots.  You're getting a lot of them?MOORE: Yeah. We saw an absentee ballot record on Monday of this week, five days before the primary. About 25,000 returned at that point. That's more than last time. And we'll have about -- I think about 40,000 returned once it's all said and done. Tomorrow .KELLY: Is that military?MOORE: . I can't (ph). That includes military and overseas ballots, as well. It's right, Megyn.KELLY: Can you glean anything from that?MOORE: People are excited. They want to turn the page on seven years of bad policies.KELLY: What I mean about who they're voting .MOORE: When you put a Republican into the White House .KELLY: . for?MOORE: Well, I think it's hard to say. A lot of absentee ballots returned and -- in Horry County or around the Coast, some in the upstate, some in Charleston, the low country. It's a big mix, depending on what candidate you think might do well tomorrow.KELLY: So, you can't tell anything along ideological lines like you're getting a ton in moderate counties or you're getting in really conservative counties.MOORE: Not really. The upstate maybe in random (ph) -- maybe that helps Ted Cruz on the Coast, maybe -- maybe Donald Trump, maybe down in Charleston. It's hard to tell. It's a big mix -- a big melting pot down in Charleston. But certainly, it's one thing to watch tomorrow night.KELLY: Are you going to predict a winner?MOORE: Well, Donald Trump has been leading the past 20 out of 21 polls I believe here in South Carolina. I it would be a big surprise tomorrow night if Donald Trump does not win. The race here seems to be for second and being in the top tier of candidates that goes on next week to Nevada and to the Southern States on March 1st.KELLY: Who's got the best ground game?MOORE: I've seen great things from the Bush campaign, from the Cruz campaign, from Rubio campaign. They've all been on the ground and neighborhood. Some of them more targeted approach, some with a more shotgun approach to -- to that kind of thing. I've seen wonderful social media efforts. So, this is the first time we've really seen a robust social media effort in the primary here in South Carolina. So, a lot of good -- a lot of good signs for the fall for us.KELLY: Yes. How critical is the ground game though? Is that -- is that going to make or break somebody?MOORE: Well, it's such a big primary. It's hard to say. I think it can add about two or three points, maybe four or five points maximum to a person's number. I'm not sure it will matter tomorrow night but .KELLY: Yeah.MOORE: . it certainly .KELLY: Getting the lead.MOORE:  . for first place was -- but .KELLY: Yeah.MOORE: . definitely for second and third place, it will have an impact.KELLY: Matt, thank you. We'll be watching.MOORE:  Thanks, Megyn. Take care.KELLY: And we'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: So, tune in tomorrow night for the GOP South Carolina Primary and the Democratic Nevada caucus results. Brett Baier and yours truly will be on the air from 6:00 to 10:00 as the numbers come in. Who will win South Carolina? What about Nevada? Join us tomorrow.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: Thanks for staying with us. I'm Bill O'Reilly in the ""Personal Story"" segment tonight assessing the republican presidential contenders.Joining us now from Washington, former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich who has been through it all. All right, Mr. Speaker. Let's assess one by one. Donald Trump, has he peeked? What do you think?NEWT GINGRICH (R), FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Oh, I doubt it. Look, I think this guy learns every day. I think he has endless amounts of energy. As he has tapped into something real about the American people the desire to be great again. The desire to win. I think he is very formidable. He is not the nominee yet. He has a long, long way to go. But he certainly has done better for about four months than anybody expected. And he is staffing up. He is getting -- hiring more people, building a bigger organization. He will be formidable and somebody, I don't think he will implode. Somebody will have to beat him to stop him from becoming the nominee.O'REILLY: Okay. Ben Carson rating second in the poll. Outsider. How is his campaign shaping up?GINGRICH: Look, I think he is the most remarkable figure even more than Trump. Dr. Carson has a wonderful personal story. He has a remarkable story as a surgeon. But he is very quiet. He is very low key. And yet in South Carolina for example, he is in a solid second place nationally. He is in second place. There is something magic happening with him. And I think people who are sick and tired of Washington but also sort of tired of noise have found in Dr. Carson the alternative to Trump. The two of them together, I think, are now in like the high 50's in places like South Carolina.O'REILLY: Yes. Well, something to be said for --GINGRICH: It's an amazing performance.O'REILLY: For Dr. Carson being a decent, honest man. I mean, you know? Let's --GINGRICH: And he has, by the way, he has a real campaign.O'REILLY: Right.GINGRICH: I know the people who put it together, and Carson has a real campaign. And he has chairman in all 99 counties in Iowa. He has raised, I think, $6 million in FNC hard money in August.O'REILLY: Yes. Both Trump and Carson have genuine campaign. Now, Jeb Bush lots of money, trying to do the media thing with Colbert last night. How is he doing?GINGRICH: Well, I'm really very surprised. I you think Jeb is a very, very good politician. He was a very good governor of Florida. And he doesn't -- I think he is sort of startled by the Trump phenomenon and he hasn't found his footing. And he certainly has enough money that he should be able to go to the distance. He should still be able to have a shot at this. But he is going to have to find some pattern that we don't see yet it. Jeb Bush is a person who likes people. He is not an actual fighter. He is up against a great bar room brawler in Donald Trump. And somehow Jeb is going to have to find a way to get in the ring equally tough.O'REILLY: Yes. That's going to be interesting. Yes, that's going to be interesting. All right. Marco Rubio, a senator from Florida, competitive but really hasn't' caught fire.GINGRICH: Yes. Look. He is stunningly talented. He is a terrific person. And he is very knowledgeable. He is almost a natural vice presidential nominee. But he hasn't broken through yet to be a presidential contender in a way that he should. And his performance was fine in the first debate. But it didn't -- people nodded yes but they didn't then vote for him. And that's a challenge for Marco to figure out what's the missing ingredient here?O'REILLY: I don't know either. Ted Cruz, very bombastic himself. How do you assess his chances?GINGRICH: Well, Cruz is doing something very clever. Cruz is in a sense riding right next to Trump. I mean, the fact that Cruz inviting Trump to come to the U.S. capitol today and to oppose the Iranian deal together, you know, we will see. Cruz is a very, very smart man. And in the absence of Trump would have been the natural Tea Party candidate and maybe in the absence of Carson the natural evangelical candidate. The problem he has got is both those guys are now bigger than he is.O'REILLY: Yes.GINGRICH: And he hasn't quite yet figured out how to get past them.O'REILLY: Scott Walker, governor of Wisconsin hasn't caught on yet, has he?GINGRICH: No. And it's a little bit of a surprise. I have known Scott for a lot of years. He is very solid guy. Very courageous guy in what he did in Madison in taking on the government employee unions. But he is very quiet in a different way than Carson. He hasn't found his voice. And he hasn't communicated the kind of fervent, direct appeal that people want to hear. People want to feel it's in your gut. That you are ready to lead the country.O'REILLY: Yes. If you're an emotional guy.GINGRICH: Yes.O'REILLY: All right. The four remaining in the CNN debate, it looks like are Fiorina, Kasich, Huckabee and Christie. Any of those four do you feel have a chance to break out?GINGRICH: Yes. I think both Fiorina and Kasich have huge opportunities. Kasich has run a very smart campaign. He is in second place in New Hampshire, which was a deliberate campaign decision on their part. He has raised a good bit of money. He is the governor of one of the most important states in electoral politics. He is the only sitting governor who has a net positive. He is about 60 percent approval. And he is probably the most innovative governor in the country. So, Kasich could break out presently. And Fiorina has had, you know, a great break through. I mean, this kind of ironic.O'REILLY: Very feisty.GINGRICH: She didn't make the first debate but in the result she got a bigger boost being on in the earlier debate than she would have gotten had she been next to Trump.O'REILLY: Yes. She'll be there next Wednesday night. Mr. Speaker we will going to bother you from time to time to come back in and take a look at the campaign.GINGRICH: All right.O'REILLY: We really appreciate it. Thank you.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

"This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" July 12, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, amid palpable anger and intense protests, a manhunt is now underway in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, for potential cop killers. After police discover a group of people planning a deadly attack on law enforcement.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly. The initial arrests in what police are calling a plot to kill cops first happened on Saturday.  But with at least one of the would-be killers still on the loose, police decided to go public just a couple of hours ago. They say several men broke into a pawnshop this weekend, stealing the guns to carry out the attack as payback for the shooting of suspect Alton Sterling. And that's not all that now has law enforcement on edge in Louisiana and elsewhere.Fox News Will Carr is live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana for us tonight with more. Will?WILL CARR, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Megyn. While it's pretty much a block party atmosphere here in front of the Triple S Convenience Store, Alton Sterling was killed seven days ago. Members of local law enforcement say they have discovered this credible threat to shoot police officers all across this area. They say they first discovered this Saturday night when four people broke into a local pawnshop. They said they went in through the roof. They ended up stealing eight handguns.Now, one of the suspects was caught when he was trying to get away.  According to authorities, he told officers that they stole the guns and were looking for bullets to shoot cops across Baton Rouge in the wake of Alton Sterling's death. Since then, three suspects including a 13-year-old have been arrested, but one man remains at large with at least two stolen guns. We're told the other guns have been recovered.But since he's still out there, they say he is still a substantial threat to members of law enforcement across this region. It comes at the same time the hacker group anonymous is now calling for a day of action, a day of rage they're calling it after the police shootings. They're now calling for protests across the country this Friday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are calling on a collective day of rage, a day of action centered around civil disobedience and the right to protest. To police departments across the United States, we are not your enemy.  However, it is in your hands. If you want us to stay that way or not.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARR: Anonymous has also said that they have harked the virtual infrastructure of the Baton Rouge Police Department. High-ranking officials with the Police Department tell me that is a threat they are taking very seriously tonight -- Megyn.KELLY: Will Carr, thank you. While police departments in several U.S. cities are dealing with these protests, the country today turned its attention to Dallas, Texas, and a key moment for President Obama. For seven and a half years, our nation's first black president has found himself at the epicenter of the stories involving race and justice in America. At times in part based on his own words, such as suggesting wrongly early on his presidency that police acted stupidly by arresting a prominent Black Harvard professor following a confrontation at that professor's home.You may recall that resulted in a so-called beer summit between the President, Vice President Biden, Professor Henry Louis Gate and then confronted by police, and Cambridge Police Sergeant James Crowley. Then there was President Obama's decision to insert himself into the controversy surrounding the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in Florida. ""If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon."" Two years later, the President would inject his administration again into a legal matter, the shooting case involving Michael Brown and Police Officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, sending in his Justice Department and dozens of FBI agents.Even enlisting the help of the fiery activist Reverend Al Sharpton, who helped perpetuate the story that Michael Brown, who was black, died with his hands up, begging for his life. A story that turned out to be a blatant lie, which Al Sharpton refuses to admit to this day. Then five days ago, five police officers were gunned down by a madman who not only hated cops but specifically said he wanted to target white cops. And at the memorial service for those fallen officers today, President Obama again stepped into the breach.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRES. BARACK OBAMA (D), UNITED STATES: These men and their families shared a commitment to something larger than themselves. They weren't looking for their names to be up in lights. They'd tell you the pay was decent but wouldn't make you rich. They could have told you about the stress and long shifts, and they'd probably agree with Chief Brown when he said that cops don't expect to hear the words ""thank you"" very often, especially from those who need them the most. That in this country, we don't have soldiers in the streets or militias setting the rules. Instead, we have public servants, police officers, like the men who were taken away from us.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Across social media, those remarks were widely praised. Even some of Mr. Obama's harshest critics found praise for the tone and message of the first ten minutes of his remarks. But then the speech took a turn.  Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: Race relations have improved dramatically in my lifetime. Those who deny it are dishonoring the struggles that helped us achieve that progress. But we know --  (APPLAUSE)But, America, we know that bias remains. Although most of us do our best to guard against it and teach our children better. None of us is entirely innocent. No institution is entirely immune. And that includes our police departments.As a society, we choose to underinvest in decent schools. We allow poverty to fester so that entire neighborhoods offer no prospect for gainful employment. We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining us now, Brit Hume, our Fox News senior political analyst.  There you were on special report last night, Brit, calling out the President for doing exactly this, and you walked us through into the Ferguson case and the Trayvon Martin case. And the question is whether he just did it again.BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I must say, I want to add my voice to those who thought the first part of the President's speech was just terrific. He was eloquent. He struck the right tone. His message was strong and clear. The tribute to the police officers seemed heartfelt and moving, and my thought was this is -- this is Barack Obama at his best, at his most eloquent. This is him putting his oratorical skills, which can be considerable, to the best use. By I, like you, was struck by the turn that he made and especially by that last comment that he made that you showed on the air where he said, you know, that it would be easier for a teenager to get a glock pistol than to get a gun or even a book.Now, that's nonsense. But it was in furtherance of the agenda that he was talking about, about, you know, spending in the inner cities, about gun control and all the rest of it. And I was frankly disappointed that he chose to go in that direction. You know, the President has a problem in the sense that he -- to him, I think, racism in America has a white face, never a black face. That's why you heard him say in the aftermath of the hideous murders of the policemen in Dallas that we might never be able to untangle the motives of the shooter. The shooter's motives were perfectly clear.KELLY: Uh-hm.HUME: He said in his conversations with the police that he wanted to kill police and he wanted to kill white people. I'm not saying the President would deny that that's what he said, but the President's reaction to it suggests that he glosses over these sorts of things the same way, Megyn, that when it comes to the hideous violence against blacks, black-on-black violence in cities like Chicago and Baltimore and others, the President has been virtually silent on that issue though far more black lives are lost in that way than are ever lost to incidents involving police shootings.KELLY: Uh-hm. I want to talk to you about that. But just on the memorial service today. I mean Brit, we've talked about President Obama's responsibility to sometimes be comforter in chief and how he has at times shirked that, you know, when we've had Americans get beheaded, you know, the President is saying, okay, I'm going off to play golf and making a passing remark, you know, from Martha's Vineyard in a way that feels like wait, whoa.I don't know if he gets it. I don't know if he understands. You know, the night after Benghazi and our four Americans killed, he had a fund-raiser.  And now here today at the memorial service, like, okay, he's got an anti- gun thing, you know, or at least a push to change the confines or redefine them of the Second Amendment. At the memorial service for the dead cops?HUME: Yes, that -- look, that's obviously the real question here is the President is entitled to his policy preferences and he's entitled to his views, and he has plenty of opportunity. He's the man with the biggest megaphone in the country and perhaps the world to express them. It's a good question whether it's appropriate to do so in a memorial service like this, and especially after he's already paid splendid tribute to these fallen officers in a way that obviously the audience in the hall greatly appreciated and I think the country appreciated.KELLY: Uh-hm.HUME: And, you know, I'm at a little bit of a loss to explain why he decided to turn in the direction he turned. But he did.KELLY: You know, to what extent do you think he has the power to influence the debate because we've been talking a lot this week about language and whether chants like ""what do we want, dead cops, when do we want them, now,"" influences somebody like this crazed shooter in Dallas or the next potential shooter. And not to put the blame on the President at all, but to what extent do his words, you know, influence the discussion and the tone in the country?HUME: Well, look at it this way, Megyn. These cases in which Black Lives Matter have become -- has become so prominent, particularly the shooting in Ferguson, the Michael Brown case.KELLY: Uh-hm.HUME: That is what gave Black Lives Matter its impetus. The President's sympathy for that movement and some of the beliefs that -- look, for example, at the very name of the group. Black Lives Matter. Now, I heard one journalist the other day or saw one journalist write that people didn't seem to get what that meant really was Black Lives Matter too. Who doubts that? I don't think there are many white people in America at all who don't think that Black Lives Matter. It's just that they believe all other lives matter as well. Nobody -- nobody -- nobody is of the view that black lives that are lost in America don't matter.The premise, the name of the group, I think, is a fallacy. But the President has supported it, and I can't -- there's no way to know with any certainty to what extent the President's seeming approval of this idea gives legitimacy to the kinds of hideous acts that we've seen, you know, in Dallas and some other places, and now it seems perhaps it might have been attempted in Baton Rouge had it not been stopped. So that is the question.  There's no way to know the answer for sure, but it strikes me that it ought to be very clear to the President and to other leaders in this country that you need to be very careful in what you say and be sure your facts are sound and that you're balanced about it.KELLY: Hillary Clinton went out and had a meeting with the mother of Michael Brown and, you know, holding Michael Brown up as a victim, which has been proven to be false. He was the aggressor on Officer Darren Wilson. Officer Wilson was the potential victim, and he fought back to save his life. And Hillary Clinton, like Reverend Al, does not seem to have yet come to accept that reality. Brit, good to see you.HUME: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: So, even before President Obama today called for a larger conversation about race and law enforcement, we tried to get that discussion going on this broadcast last night. Wow, did we put together an amazing group of people from all sides of this issue. It is all anybody wanted to talk to me today. Everybody was talking about last night in our program. And the conversation we had not only took up all of last night's show, it continued well after.Here's a little of what you did not see.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: We had Reverend Jesse Jackson on the show last week and we talked about the murders that we had seen. We'll find out whether they were murders. The killings that we had seen in Louisiana and Minnesota, and he said those cops had racism in their hearts. And I said, how do you know that? We haven't even had an investigation yet. Go ahead, Ron.RON HOSKO, FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE FBI: Jesse Jackson, a man of faith, what is his faith when he can see that little evidence and reach that conclusion so quickly? How is he bringing us together?PASTOR MARK BURNS, PRESIDENT, THE NOW TELEVISION NETWORK: I'm from South Carolina. I know what real racism is. I have six beautiful brown babies. My wonderful, beautiful wife is sitting here right beside me. I know what real racism looks like. It is only until we as a black people first of all stop killing and hurting ourselves, number two, we cannot keep police on trial. Every police is not out to kill black people. Not every police is not out to destroy black people.(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)Hold on. If I call on you, you will stop interrupting everybody else.  Go ahead.LISA DURDEN, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Here's the answer. I have a simple answer. One possible simple solution that a five-year-old can understand -- and some folks are going to hate my guts, but I'm open for it. If every person of color in this country stops running around trying not to be black, we would not be the minority -- we would not be the minority.(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)We would not be --KELLY: What do you mean by that?DURDEN: We would not be minority because we would be all color. We would not be the minority. We would then have the power to turn our community around.KELLY: What do you mean by that?DURDEN: How do we begin to heal when the cops think they're getting murdered and when black men think they're getting murdered and black mothers think their kids are going to get murdered, and they're not talking to each other? They don't trust each other, and they're afraid certainly on one side and starting to be on the other of each other. I'll give that one to you. Go ahead, Richard Fowler.RICHARD FOWLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NEW LEADERS COUNCIL: And I'll heard a lot of stuff tonight. You hear a lot of stuff about black on black crime.  My mother was a single mother. I went to school. I'm sitting on this set.  But yet still as a black man who lives on the border of Virginia when I drive in Virginia at night time, and when the police pull me over at first, in the 90s I was worried about getting arrested. After Rodney King, I was worried about getting beat. Now I'm worried about being killed.GAYLE TROTTER, SECOND AMENDMENT ADVOCATE: Here's a novel idea. How about we roll back the strict gun control laws in dangerous neighborhoods and allow the citizens to do more of their own self-defense so that they don't have to rely on the police as much?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: It was unbelievable. You can see that's all new. So in the middle of last night's panel, civil rights activist Joe Hicks touched off a fierce debate when he asked this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE HICKS, CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST: Two black men and a nine-year-old boy walk out of a liquor store, mowed down by a black suspect. Where was Black Lives Matter? Did you guys mobilize in San Bernardino?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Uh-hm. We will put that question to U.S. Senate candidate Darryl Glenn, and NFL Star Benjamin Watson when we come back in moments.Plus, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg attacks Donald Trump and one of the top law professors in the country is here to explain how he thinks she has damaged the high court. Can you imagine what would happen if this had been done by Clarence Thomas to Hillary Clinton? You couldn't get away from the story.And then after Attorney General Loretta Lynch refused to answer questions about why the Department of Justice gave Hillary Clinton a pass, our Catherine Herridge decided to take a shot and we'll show you what happened. Stay tuned.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Will you investigate? Will there be consequences?  Does the rule of law still matter in this country?(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Well, as you saw moments ago, a deeply emotional and candid conversation about race in America unfolded right here on ""The Kelly File"" last night. One of our panelists, former civil rights leader Joe Hicks receive aid lot of reaction when he challenged some of the choices made by the Black Lives Matter Movement. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Wait. Let him finish.HICKS: Last week three people were walking out of a liquor store in San Bernardino. People are familiar with San Bernardino because that's where the massacre took place. Two black men and a nine-year-old boy walked out of a liquor store, mowed down by a black suspect. Where was Black Lives Matter? Did you guys mobilize in San Bernardino?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: The boy Hicks is referring to is Trayvon Williams. On Friday night, heading into fifth grade, this child was with his father at a local store celebrating the fact that his dad had agreed to buy him some candy.  His joy abruptly ended when Trayvon, his father, and another man walked outside of the store and were gunned down.Joining me now is Colorado Senate candidate Darryl Glenn, who recently shared powerful thoughts on the need to unite America. Darryl, thank you for being here. And they believe that third party was the intended target, that it was gang violence. And this has plagued the black community for many, many years, and we're hearing more and more people ask if Black Lives Matter, why don't we hear more from the movement highlighting that issue?  Your thoughts.DARRYL GLENN, SENATE CANDIDATE IN COLORADO: Well, thanks for having me on. And that's precisely the point. Unfortunately we have -- it starts from the top. When you have the President almost race baiting and picking and choosing which issues to interact in, and I think it's important. You have to look at the fact that you can either be a part of the problem or part of the solution. This is a perfect opportunity to come together as a community and talk about these issues. But the more that we come together, that's the way out to be able to address these issues.KELLY: It's so hard. Last night that panel we had was so passionate and fiery and angry. People feel angry on both sides now. They feel under siege.GLENN: Well, they're talking over one another. You know, what I would challenge them to do is really take a look at what Dallas has done.  They're at the cutting edge when you start thinking about all the positive things that they've done, whether it's the use of force training. But it's so important to be able to get policy leaders, the law enforcement and community leaders together in a room and have a thoughtful discussion about a way forward. That's how we do this.KELLY: What do you think about President Obama's remarks today?GLENN: Well, I think I share the same sentiment as a lot of people.  He started off okay, but unfortunately he continues to race bait, and I'll be blunt about that. He continues to insert a policy discussion into a situation where we should be uniting the country. There's a time and a place for a policy discussion. That was not the time and the place, and especially when it's so polarizing the issues that he's raising.KELLY: It's tough to discuss, and we've seen that firsthand. Darryl, thank you so much.GLENN: Thank you.KELLY: Joining us now with more reaction is Ben Watson. He's an NFL player and the author of the book ""Under Our Skin."" A very timely piece given what we're seeing. I recommend the book to everyone. You know, it seems like it's getting worse and you've talked about how, look, both sides need to understand what the other goes through. You're a successful NFL football player, and you made it, you made it. But you've had experiences as a black man that would make our skin crawl. We would be horrified.BENJAMIN WATSON, BALTIMORE RAVENS PLAYER: Definitely. I can identify many different experiences that I've had over the course of my life and things that I've witnessed where it seemed that black men, specifically me or someone else may have got the, you know, different treatment than somebody else would in that same situation. I can recall a time even recently when it happened.  KELLY: Yes. But when you drive your car, right?WATSON: Yes.KELLY: People don't know that you're an NFL star.WATSON: Yes.KELLY: Do you ever worry?WATSON: Of course.KELLY: Well, I know. But you know, there's a bias that sometimes has built in in a socio-economic level. And when they see a big superstar, they may not think the same issues apply.WATSON: Of course.KELLY: But do you worry, you know, like you heard Richard Fowler say, I worry now I'm going to get shot.WATSON: I do because we grew up understanding that you comply with the police, that your leash is a little bit shorter. That when you've get pulled over, and like I've done before, I've been pulled over. And I actually worried, you know, if something going to happen to me even though I'm a law abiding citizen. That is a real fear and it's something that we have to come to grips with. That being said, of course you comply with the police when something happens, and I respect the police officers.But something as you learn as a young black men in this country is that you know what? Life is a little bit different for you. Even though on the surface it seems to be the same. I mean, we've come such a long way, and I always love to talk about how far we've come and just a tribute to the people who have died for those things. But we're still in a place where we still struggle.KELLY: So, I'm going to ask you this for both sides.WATSON: Your one message for police officers of America and your one message for young black men of America.KELLY: Well, the message for both is to understand each other.  Police officers are in a place of authority. They have a job to do. They protect and serve. They put away lawmakers. We need them. My message for everyone not -- is to obey. When a police officer asks you to do something, do it. My message for everybody --KELLY: But a lot of guys say, I wasn't do anything wrong. He was out of line. He stopped me. He had no right. You know?WATSON: That's true. That happens sometimes. But, you know, our job as citizens is to obey what police officers say. The police officers job is to respect their citizens that they pull over and the citizens that they're in control of. For everybody, I think that we all, when we look at this situation of race, we need a change of heart, and I said it before. I believe the heart change comes from repenting of your racism, repenting of your bias, repenting of your prejudice and understanding that, you know what, God sees us all the same. And that's the most important thing. We need to get our hearts straight. And after we get the hearts straight, we can treat each other straight. But I can't treat you right if I look at you as inferior and that's what we're seeing a lot of right now.  KELLY: You know how it goes. A lot of these cops and white people see the what do we want, dead cops, when do we want them, now.WATSON: Yes.KELLY: They say, forget this.WATSON: They put their guard up.KELLY: And then a lot of black people see these cops, the bad ones that we've seen in the bad shootings and say, they're killing us. They're killing us.(CROSSTALK)WATSON: Megyn, each of us has a sphere of influence. Each of us has relationships (INAUDIBLE) relationships we need to foster. We're looking at this from such a macro perspective and it's important to look at it that way. But each of us has individual relationships in our churches, in our schools, in our sports teams, in our jobs where we need to have these conversations. We need to be honest and say, you know what? I don't understand why black people are feeling this way and I can't as a black man get so upset at you because you asked an honest question.You need to listen to what I say as I black man, I feel this way and receive what I'm saying and not get offended. We're coming into it with so many little snippets here, snippets there. You turn on the news and you see these little sound bites that create division amongst us and create sides. We all get on our own side. And my point is that you know what, there's a problem here. Do we want to fix it, or do we not want to fix it?  We need to look at truth. We need to look at justice, and we need to look at righteousness. And let that be our guide going forward.KELLY: You need to be on TV, not playing football but talking for a living very soon.WATSON: Well, I care about this country. I care about this country.  I care about what's happening. I care about my kids. I've got five kids, Megyn. I've got five kids, been married 11 years. I care about the world they're going to grow up in. I care about my white friends and my back friends. And I understand that, you know, it's important that we get this thing right. We have serious issues in this country when it comes to race.  But it's not -- all hope is not lost. There is still hope.KELLY: I think everybody in Baltimore is mad at me right now. Don't tell him he doesn't need to be playing football. I just meant, you know, eventually after you decide to move on.WATSON: We've been through it. We've been through it.KELLY: Yes. I'm sure there would be many television executives that would love to scoop you up. Great to see you.WATSON: Thank you, Megyn.KELLY: Thanks for being here.Also tonight, growing complaints after liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg publicly attacks Donald Trump. What is up with that? Seriously, not once, not twice, but three separate times. One of the country's top law professors is here on the fallout.Plus, a majority of Americans believe Hillary Clinton deserved to be criminally charged for mishandling America's secrets. But today the nation's top law enforcement official refused to even address it. Marc Thiessen and Larry Korb are next on that. Don't go away.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: From the world headquarters of Fox News, it's ""The Kelly File"" with Megyn Kelly.MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS THE KELLY FILE SHOW HOST: Breaking tonight, new polls showing the American people are not ready to move on from Hillary Clinton's e-mail scandal despite her campaign's insistence that it's old news. In a new ABC News ""Washington Post"" survey, 56 percent of Americans including six in ten independents and even three in ten Democrats disapprove of the FBI's decision not to recommend charges for the former Secretary of State.Nine out of ten Republicans say it was a bad move. Then today, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, the superior of FBI director James Comey, refused to answer any, and we do mean any questions on the findings of her department's investigation. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LORETTA LYNCH, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: As attorney general, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the underlying facts of the investigation. I would have to refer you to director Comey's statements. Again, I would refer you to director Comey. To answer further would require a discussion of the facts which, as I've indicated, I'm not in a position to provide.REP. BOB GOODLATTE, R-VA., HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Your refusal to answer questions regarding one of the most important investigations of someone who seeks to serve in the highest office in this land is an abdication of your responsibility.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Our chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge also tried to get some answers directly from the attorney general today. Catherine is with us tonight. Hi, Catherine.CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, moments before the hearing we tried to pin down the attorney general on outstanding issues with the Clinton e-mails. As you'll see here, Loretta Lynch was surrounded by aides and security.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HERRIDGE: Attorney general, good morning. Can you take a question before the hearing? Hillary Clinton gave a sworn declaration to the federal court that was wrong. She is now accused of doing the same thing to Congress. Will you investigate? Will there be consequences? Does the rule of law still matter in this country?(END VIDEO CLIP)HERRIDGE: On the Justice Department website, the statement says the attorney general's job is to advise on the law and its application, but today Lynch avoided all discussion of the applicable statutes in the Clinton case. And then she insisted her Phoenix tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton one week before Hillary Clinton was cleared of criminal charges, was not cause for a special prosecutor.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LYNCH: I've had no conversations about Mrs. Clinton's e-mail server at any point in time with either her or former President Clinton.REP. LAMAR SMITH, R-TEXAS, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Have you had any conversation with either individual about your possibly serving in a Hillary Clinton administration?LYNCH: No. I've had no conversations with either individual.(END VIDEO CLIP)HERRIDGE: But Lynch admitted the Phoenix meeting led her to do something she had never done in her 22 years as a lawyer and prosecutor, accept the FBI's recommendation regardless of the finding.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: You can't say I'm the attorney general and I decide but yet I'm going to take their recommendations even before they make their recommendations.LYNCH: I want to make it clear that any conversation that I might have had with the former president would have no impact on the team the review.JORDAN: I think your actions made it worse.(END VIDEO CLIP)HERRIDGE: Committee Democrats said the four-hour hearing was a pathetic attempt to keep the e-mail issue alive, Megyn.KELLY: Catherine Herridge, thank you. Joining us now is Mark Thiessen, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and Larry Korb, former Assistant Defense Secretary. Good to see you both. So Mark, the American people believe this was the wrong move and Loretta Lynch would not elaborate at all! At all. Your thoughts?MARK THIESSEN, AMERICN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE RESIDENT FELLOW: It's remarkable. First of all, it's not just the American people who believe by a 21 point margin, they believe that Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted, and think about what that number means. Six in ten Americans believe that Hillary Clinton should be going to the jail house, not the White House. That is a stunning, stunning figure. And including as you pointed out, three in ten Democrats. So, even a significant minority of Democrats agree with that.KELLY: And yet they might vote for her because her number -- she's still ahead in most of these -- these polls. So, I mean American people thinks that she's a felon, but she might be president.THIESSEN: It's a common (ph) commentary on the state of the election. Exactly. I mean it's a stunning election we're in. But then you've got Loretta Lynch, who goes up there on Capitol Hill today and basically stands up before Congress and says, ""I refuse to answer on the grounds that it might incriminate Hillary Clinton."" That was basically her testimony. She took the Fifth for Hillary. I mean -- and what's amazing about that, Megyn, is that she didn't recuse herself.It would be one thing if she had recused herself. One thing if she had recused and said, oh I'm sorry I can't answer questions that took myself out of it. She refused to recuse herself. She made the decision. Comey made the recommendation. Loretta Lynch made the decision. So, you've got 56 percent of Americans who don't agree with that decision and want answers, and she refuses to stand before the American people and explain herself.KELLY: What do you make of it, Larry? I mean, Director Comey did take questions from Congress and did hold a presser (ph), but his boss, no.LARRY KORB, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS: Well, I think Director Comey was inappropriate to hold that press conference before he came out with the decision. If you go back and you take a look when Patrick Fitzgerald decided to indict Scooter Libby for obstruction of justice and perjury, he was asked well, what about all the other people who might have leaked. No.The job of the FBI and the Justice Department is to conduct an investigation and then if they want to indict, send it to a grand jury. If they don't, they're not supposed to be saying anything. That's the problem that we have here.KELLY: But they would have just gotten killed if they had done that in a case of this magnitude, in this, you know, this much under scrutiny, would they not?KORB: No. He's got a 10-year appointment, and basically he said I conducted -- you know, the FBI has got to be careful. They charged Thomas Drake, who was an NSA employee with ten counts of mishandling classified information. It went to trial. The judge said, ""You had no case. Why did you even bring this?"" So, I think that's the key thing.KELLY: But the thing is -- but, Mark, like as Catherine points out, Loretta Lynch's job is to advise on the law, and she wouldn't even get up there and speak to the legal issues. This was her -- her call on the law, and she wouldn't elaborate.THIESSEN: No, absolutely. She was asked a point blank question. Is it against the law for someone who has a security clearance to share classified information with someone who does not have a security clearance and is not cleared to have that information? And she said, ""I refer you to Director Comey's statement and you know, by the way, I'm incredibly proud of the people, men and women, current people of the Justice Department.""I think she said that like eight times. She wouldn't even answer a basic question on the law. And to be honest, Larry's concept that we're going to have a what, eight-month investigation of the former Secretary of State and a presidential nominee, and he's just going to stand up there, and say, we've decided not to charge her, thank you very much. I mean you have to explain it. People have to understand this. And we still haven't gotten the answers, Larry.KELL: She has commented on it many, many times. Hillary Clinton has...(CROSSTALK)KORB: Wait a second. You know, as Matt Miller, who used to be a Justice Department spokesman pointed out today. If, in fact, let's say they were investigating the Koch brothers or union leaders, then they decided not to charge them but said, you know, in the investigation we found out these people are doing all these horrible things, no. This is the crime for which she was...KELLY: She was our Secretary of State while she was doing this. There has to be some public accountability.THIESSEN: The problem is there's too much debate. There were too many open (ph) with the Clintons.KORB: That's why -- that's why you have an...THIESSEN: We know too much.KELLY: Charles Koch doesn't answer to us. She does. All right, guys. I've got to leave it at that.KORB: That's why we have an Inspector General. They are supposed to do that. That's their job and then they decide whether or not to...  THIESSEN: They're not to refer (ph) it.KELLY: Okay, great to see you guys.THIESSEN: Th Koch brothers aren't running for president.KELLY: No, they're not. They're enjoying life down south. Why shouldn't they? Up next, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, her attack on Donald Trump and whether she damaged the high court. Professor Jonathan Turly is here.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: New reaction tonight to a Supreme Court justice issuing opinions. No. Not the kind that follow a judicial decision in a case while the highest court is in session, but to press outlets, three of them. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has shared with the world some very choice words for the presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, prompting uproar from Democrats and Republicans. Trace Gallagher has the latest. Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, interviews with Supreme Court justices are rare enough, but it's even more unusual for a justice to offer scathing political opinions. But when the conversation turn to Donald Trump, Ruth Bader Ginsburg pulled very few punches, calling him a faker, saying, ""He has no consistency about him -- says whatever comes into his head at the moment, and has an ego.""Justice Ginsburg also wandered, quoting, ""How he has gotten away with not turning over his tax returns?"" saying, ""The press seems to be very gentle with him."" The 83-year-old justice didn't sound as if she's planning to step down anytime soon, but is concerned about the future of the court, saying, it's likely the next president will have a few appointments to make and adding, quoting again, ""I can't imagine what this place would be with Donald Trump as our president.""Well, Donald Trump quickly fired back, telling ""The New York times,"" quote, ""I think it's highly inappropriate that a United States Supreme Court judge gets involved in a political campaign frankly. I think it's a disgrace to the court, and I think she should apologize to the court."" Democratic Senators Dick Durbin, Sheldon Whitehouse and Chris Murphy also spoke out against Ginsburg's statements and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called her comments totally inappropriate.Justice Ginsburg also scolded senate Republicans for not moving to hold hearings on Judge Merrick Garland -- that's President Obama's Supreme Court nominee to replace Antonin Scalia who died in February. Ginsburg said she's hoping another Democrat joins the court so she can vote in the majority more often, but she also misses her old conservative friend, Justice Scalia saying, without him, the court is a quote, ""paler place."" Megyn.KELLY: Trace, thank you. Joining us with more is Jonathan Turley, constitutional law attorney and professor at George Washington University Law School. Great to see you professor. So, what did you make of her comments?JONATHAN TURLEY, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ATTORNEY: Well, they were thoughtless, but more importantly, I think they were facially unethical. Canon Five of the Judicial Code says that judges cannot make statements of this kind in opposition to political candidates. Now, the way these justices get around that is they claim that those rules of ethics only apply to lesser jurists.This may come as a surprise to most Americans, but the nine justices claim that the rules of ethics cannot be enforced against them, that they look at those rules voluntarily and decide how they will apply to themselves. And as you might imagine, the result is that they often are the judges of their own case and find themselves entirely innocent.KELLY: Se, this is clearly intentional. She made the remarks repeatedly to three different outlets, going on about how if he wins, it reminds her of something her husband used to say, """"Now it's time for us to move to New Zealand."" I mean, it's very clear her opposition to him. And Trump on this issue, you tell me. He's entirely right. She was out of line.TURLEY: He is right, and what she did is not just wrong ethically. It undermines the integrity of the Supreme Court. It's a very serious blow to that court. The Supreme Court has many flaws, but one of its great tenants (ph) is this impartiality and this separation from politics. And what Justice Ginsburg did was undermine that tradition.KELLY: What was she doing? Why? I mean, do you think people vote based on what Ruth Bader Ginsburg thinks? Why would she do this?TURLEY: Well, unfortunately, I think that many of these justices have become enthralled with what I call the age of the celebrity justice. They're increasingly going to audiences. They're enjoying this limelight, and in my view, it's a terrible trend. I prefer the old model where justices spoke entirely through their opinions.But I think you see this sort of corrosive effect on the judgment of justices in this interview. But many of these justices have committed unethical acts in the past. A majority of them have committed acts that would have been serious matters for lower judges. But they consider themselves beyond the rules of ethics, at least in terms of enforceability.KELLY: Wow. It's really remarkable. Professor Turley, it's always great to hear your opinion. Thank you for being here.TURLEY: Thanks Megyn.KELLY: Well, Senator Bernie Sanders today did something considered unthinkable just a couple of weeks ago. That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: After months of battling Hillary Clinton for delegates, today Bernie Sanders joined her in New Hampshire to offer his full support for her candidacy. A far cry from some of what we've seen in recent weeks.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT.: I don't think that you are qualified if you get $15 million from Wall Street through your Super PAC.Hillary Clinton knows that something is fundamentally wrong when the very rich become rich off... I don't think you are qualified if you have voted for the disastrous war in Iraq.Hillary Clinton will make an outstanding president.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, Nomiki Konst, who's a Bernie Sanders supporter, and Katrina Pierson, who's the Trump campaign national spokesperson. Nomiki, first of all, what's with the endorsement without suspending his campaign? So like, he's still running but he wants us to vote for her?NOMIKI KONST, BERNIE SANDERS SUPPORTER: So that's actually a technical thing and it's a really good question that you ask that. So, I just got back from the platform committee meetings in Orlando and the platform committee members for Bernie Sanders and a delegate, and one of the things that a lot of people don't know is that if he suspends his campaign, he can no longer have the rules committee meetings.The delegates can't vote in a roll call at the convention, which really is what pushes the Democratic Party the way he wants it to go. And that's what it's been since the beginning. I don't think he knew, I don't think his supporters knew, I don't think anyone knew how big this revolution would grow. And the reality is we had half of the support of that platform meeting, which didn't even exist before.Really, this platform meetings area a bunch of Democratic Party leaders and hack, that we had a bunch of activists and revolutionaries come in and change the platform. That's what we plan on doing at the convention.KELLY: Katrina, Nomiki went in and busted up the hacks, and now her candidate is probably going to be Hillary Clinton now but wants to beat your candidate. And you tell me whether his prior statements, Bernie's prior statements about her are going to come back to haunt him or her?KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP CAMPAIGN NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: Oh, absolutely, Megyn. You know, I can tell from my inbox that there are many Bernie Sanders supporters that have had their Ides of March moment. As an activist, I can tell you we've all had them. There were a lot of them who truly thought he was not going to support her for a number of reasons.Bernie Sanders' entire campaign was running against Hillary Clinton literally. She is the candidate of Wall Street. She is the candidate of war. She is the candidate of creditors when tuitions, college rates went up, she was right there supporting them.KELLY: That's what Bernie is saying. That's the thing Nomiki. She's not qualified. She lacks judgment. She has a conflict of interest. He told Jake Tapper in taking money for the Clinton Foundation from the salaries. I mean, he sounded like Trump. I mean, he sounded like somebody who opposed her, and now here he is asking us to let him vouch for her.KONST: I think what people are missing is it's not about Bernie, it's not about Hillary. It's not about Trump. It's not about Joe Stein and the green side or Jerry Johnson. This movement is about the people, the movement of movements that are going to push whoever is in power to be held accountable.KELLY: The movement didn't work out.KONST: It has actually. We changed the platform. We're going to change the rules. And let me tell you, these people are not going to hold back. They're going to push Hillary.KELLY: You know, I mean, not to be mean, but second place is losing.KONST: So does in politics.KELLY: Katrina, I don't know. You tell me.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Go ahead Katrina.PIERSON: Let me agree with Nomiki. Okay, there is a movement taking place in this country. And whether or not you're in your corner or wearing your jersey, there are hundreds of millions of people out there who are tired of those jerseys. But what they do agree with is that Wall Street and politics in this country is corrupt. They don't want any more foreign undeclared wars. They don't want trans-Pacific partnership, with which Hilary Clinton will give us as president.KELLY: Okay.PIERSON: And we have to get back to common sense, and Donald Trump is that candidate.KELLY: Great to see you both. Nicely done. Nice coordination on your colors as well, red and red. A little purple in the middle. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: So, people really love Benjamin Watson. This is his book, ""Under Our Skin."" You can check it out. It's about -- listen to this, ""Appeals to the power and possibility of faith as a step toward healing. We could use a little of that right now. Good night, everybody. I'm Megyn Kelly.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
