But she says she's also passionate about creating work places that make people happy. The attorney now creates workplace policies and procedural manuals to help companies manage and prevent potentially contentious situations at corporate events.Office Halloween parties may not be as ubiquitous as Christmas parties but when people choose to dress up at work, employee reactions can range from amused to angry to downright aggravated.""Sometimes people just don't put their thinking cap on when it comes to costumes,"" Lee Flores tells FoxNews.com. ""They'll do inappropriate double-entendres that may seem clever outside the workplace, they may dress up as a person of another race or they might be acting in a stereotypical manner.""Lee Flores says she is not aware of any lawsuits resulting from a poorly chosen Halloween costume at a work party but, over the years, she has helped guide several companies through complaints about party attire that led to internal investigations. As more colleges introduce ""safe spaces"" and people are harangued for expressing politically incorrect opinions, it might seem unfortunate that Halloween--the one day of the year when people are supposedly given free reign to be anyone (or anything)--has become a hot button issue. Have we become too sensitive as a society? Do we really need lawyers to tell us what to do when it comes to the time honored tradition of dressing up before tearing into a fun size Snickers?Apparently. When it comes to dressing up in front of coworkers, Lee Flores says it's paramount that guidelines are clear and bosses must set the tone.""It might seem ridiculous that we're even having this convo, but the way the world is today, you'd be shocked at what people keep doing time and time again.""What may seem like common sense to one person, won't even register on another's radar. Here are just a few of Lee Flores' top tips to avoid the wrath of your coworkers-- or a gentle slap on the wrist from human resources.Wear something appropriate for a kid's party, not a raunchy late night affair.""[Characters from] popular shows and movies like ""Star Wars,"" or classic figures like Audrey Hepburn are always a great bet. Most Disney characters are great, too. Timely viral trends can be fun so I think people could do something like Pokemon GO.""Lee Flores also advises men and women to stay away from anything overtly sexual or outfits that show a lot of skin. If it's way outside the realm of your normal office attire, it's probably not appropriate.RELATED: Donald ""Trumpkins"" are taking over HalloweenSalacious news is fun but stay away from religion and politics.""If it's a controversial news story, just don't do it,"" says Lee Flores. ""There's always a mask of the current president or someone running for office out there. This election has been pretty contentious so I would recommend staying away from the two candidates.""A fake Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton strolling around the office may seem like harmless fun, but people's political beliefs may spark some unwanted arguments around the water cooler, says Lee Flores.Spoofing social issues like racial injustice, LGBT rights and war conflicts should also be crossed off the list.Whether it's a Bruce Jenner-Caitlyn crossdresser duo costume or a gagged Kim Kardashian getup, costume companies keep pushing the boundaries of questionable taste when it comes to premade getups. These items might be ""on trend"" and get a few laughs after hours but ultimately, Lee Flores doesn't think they're appropriate.""A couple of years ago, we saw various sports stars involved in incidents of domestic violence. Men would dress as athletes and their female partner would have a black eye. That, to me, is just never funny.""Employers should be direct when laying out the rules for appropriate party attire.Many offices don't have official Halloween parties but some fun-loving desk mates may want to show off their creative side on Oct. 31. Festive parties can be a great way to boost office morale and provide a few chuckles, Lee Flores says some employers have a hard time drafting a straightforward policy on what's okay and what's considered out of line. Many just wait and deal with issues on a case by case basis--but then the damage may already be done.""Sometimes employees just say 'Hey, we want to have to some Halloween fun,' so it's not always an official gathering and by the time the boss sees a costume, he or she may be reluctant to say anything for fear of coming off as uncool or too harsh.""Lee Flores recommends bosses take the time to draft a quick note to all potential office revelers and advise anyone with an issue to go to human resources. If a problem arises, let workers know they have a voice.""In the event that a costume complaint arises, a company has a tremendous opportunity to make it better quickly...or far worse,"" says Lee Flores. ""Say a white person dressed as the convenience store clerk from 'The Simpsons' and was speaking in an Indian accent all day. A fellow coworker goes to HR and says she feels uncomfortable. If that person is quickly dismissed...that employee is likely to feel even angrier and who knows what could happen.""However, if a human resource advocate acknowledges the issue and suggests coming up with a solution together, the offended employee is likely to feel as if he or she has a real influence on office culture and that their concerns are being taken seriously.""The HR manager should ask the employee who filed a complaint ""What would you like to happen?"" so they can contribute to resolving the issue.""Most responses, say Flores, are pretty benign, ""90 percent of the time, all they want is to make sure it doesn't happen again-- many don't even want an apology from the person themselves. They prefer to avoid any type of face-to-face confrontation and protect their anonymity.""Avoid perpetual embarrassment in the age of social media.Office party shenanigans of yesteryear may have embarrassed a colleague for a day or two but those crazy kegstand memories are soon forgotten without visual evidence. Enter the smartphone--and a plethora of social media apps that may catapult one harmless video or picture into viral fame forever. Just ask Ken Bone.  Embarrassing moments-- and potentially offensive costumes-- can instantly be viewed by millions.Lee Flores says it's all part of a sad but true modern reality. ""Because of all the various social media platforms, your one mess-up could end up as global news. You may be a good person, but whoops, made a mistake... and we all know how cruel people on the Internet can be.""But, says the attorney, there is a silver lining in being made aware about what presses people's buttons.""Every year you see one or two celebrities flubbing up with their costumes and everyone can see it immediately because there are so many media outlets. It might be insensitive but at least it provides a good education for those who may not be aware of why something is considered taboo in the first place.""A good rule of thumb when it comes to social media and office parties is to treat it like any other day at work.""You wouldn't just run up to a coworker sitting at his desk, minding his own business and snap close-ups his face. If someone has a cool costume, just ask before clicking away. And if you happen to be getting your picture taken, be aware of how and where it may be seen."" Still not sure if your outfit is okay?""If you're trying to be witty, funny, or even a little edgy with a costume, sit back and get a second opinion from a family member or political correct friend,"" says Lee Flores. ""Most people really aren't trying to be insensitive at all but sometimes it takes another voice to point out a potential issue."""	['Flores', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

8	8	http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2016/08/23/campaign-food-fight-between-hillary-clinton-and-donald-trump/	The fierce campaign food fight between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump	"We the people seem to have an insatiable appetite to know everything about our presidential candidates -- and that includes their eating habits. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are polar opposites not only in their politics, but in their culinary preferences.The Republican nominee has been touting a love of fast food--but is he really munching on McDonald's all day? And Clinton supposedly loves spicy food--but what else is she eating behind the scenes?If the way to a voter's heart is through the stomach, let the eating contest begin.Now shake hands and start munching.It's easy for a fast food lover to feel somewhat embarrassed these days, when the buzzwords for food include grass-fed, cage-free, gluten-free, non-GMO and agave-laden. If you've just supersized a burger and fries, it's best to eat them on the side of the road, alone in your car. And, obviously, if you're looking for votes, you shouldn't be advertising your fast food addiction on Facebook and Twitter.On the other hand, maybe you should.French fry-munching Trump has shown no shame in his game when it comes to having the diet of a couch potato. His social media posts look like a tour of shopping mall food courts. From posting a photo of his fingers crammed into a McDonald's french-fry sleeve, to a photo of him using a fork and knife to eat his finger-lickin' good KFC, to a shot of him eating a taco bowl on Cinco de Mayo (with the caption, ""The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grille. I love Hispanics!""), the gold-plated, jet-setting billionaire is clearly a gourmet of drive-thru fare. But maybe he actually isn't. At a televised town hall, after he told Anderson Cooper that he likes to eat the ""fish delight"" from McDonald's, fast food junkies decided he didn't deserve a break that day. It would have been fine, they said, if McDonald's actually served a ""fish delight,"" but Trump should have known he was eating a Filet-O-Fish.In any event, Trump might want to take it easy on his ""see-food"" diet if what they say is true: You are what you eat. ""Current research supports the fact that a poor diet results in physical and mental sluggishness,"" says Jacqui Justice, a licensed nutritionist and director of NY Health and Wellness Nutrition.""Simply put, garbage in equals garbage out. Clearly how the candidates eat will affect their decision-making ability and their overall performance as president of the United States.""And if Trump doesn't care to hear the advice of a nutritionist, maybe he'll listen to his daughter, Ivanka, who told Barbara Walters, ""I wish he would eat healthier and, you know, slow down.""This brings us to the other side of this food fight, Hillary Clinton, who apparently understands that what she eats has consequences. In 2008 she told Katie Couric the secret to maintaining her stamina:""I eat a lot of hot peppers. I for some reason started doing that in 1992, and I swear by it. I think it keeps my metabolism revved up and keeps me healthy.""But does Clinton really down a shot of fiery peppers every morning? Or is she just saying that to persuade us that she is one tough mother of dragons, someone who would be a perfect commander in chief?Clinton has said she tapped her vice presidential pick Tim Kaine for his executive and legislative experience-- but it seems his other job may be picking up some of the heavier-duty eating work for her. Last week, Senator Kaine was seen eating a pork chop on a stick at the Iowa State Fair and visiting Kansas City to munch of some of their world famous barbecue--all in the same day.You can also be sure Kaine helped Clinton win the votes of Trekkies everywhere when he posted this photograph of him and a Star Trek Enterprise butter sculpture. ""Put some butter on it and call it a win"" should be these candidates' new slogan.Political Analyst and Bold.com founder Carrie Sheffield agrees that both parties are using food to pander to the masses.""That's why both parties have so much negativity surrounding them, they are so out of touch. Trump [has] essentially created a character known as 'The Blue Collar Billionaire'... it's really all just manufactured,"" says Sheffield ""It's a character he is playing and at times, like when he eats KFC with a knife and fork, his real self shines through and shows who he really is.""And other say food itself can inherently be political. ""Even food polarizes Americans along party lines these days,"" said Dean Debnam, president of Public Policy Polling. ""Democrats and Republicans disagree on donuts and bagels, KFC and Chick-fil-A, and even the merits of Olive Garden as quality authentic ethnic food.""So how will Americans vote when one candidate has the appetite of a 12-year-old and the other has the palate of his mother? According to a poll PPC conducted three years ago, Americans have an overall negative opinion of fast food -- 40 percent favorable to 49 percent unfavorable. If that affects how people vote, Trump might want to develop a taste for quinoa and kefir.Clinton, meanwhile, seems aware of the relationship between gourmet food and votes. Last week her camp grabbed a piece of the pie by cooking up #ChefsforHillary, a Pinterest campaign where the candidate invites chefs to pin their recipes in support of her campaign. Mario Batali and Katie Lee are two of the many celebrity chefs sharing their recipes there in her support.""Chefs are the new rock stars,"" says gossip columnist and talk show host Rob Shuter. ""Using them is a very good idea to reach your targeted audience. Eating is one of the few essential things that we all do.""Good food crosses all segments of society. It's one of the few areas in life that hasn't been divisive in our culture. There is almost no greater trust than trusting someone to prepare food to put in your mouth. Very smart move by the Hillary campaign.""Carey Reilly is a lifestyle blogger, TV host, comedian and lover of cocktails. She is the editor of  www.notsoskinnymom.com.
