"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" May 13, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS: When the president says the media should change how they reports on issues, is he objecting to the coverage that he finds too critical of the way the administration is handling a particular?JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: What he pointed out is that it's important for us to recognize that we all have a stake in the success of our citizens in this country. And that's the kind of debate that he believes we should be having and that's the kind of debate that he would like to see covered on the national news.(END VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS WALLACE, ANCHOR: Kevin Corke asking White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest today about President Obama's criticism of the way media covers issues of poverty. We're back now with our panel. When the president says, quote, ""We have to change the way the media reports on these issues,"" Charles, what is he saying?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, he is letting us know that his arrogance knows no limits. Of course he wants a change in coverage, particularly the coverage of himself. After all, he was considered a Greek god in 2008, and right now people are actually judging him on the merits. He doesn't like that.He has the arrogance to say not only that the media have to change, but he also said within one day John Boehner has to change, Mitch McConnell has to change, the media have to change, Elizabeth Warren has to change. There is only one person on the firmament who doesn't have to change, and that's Barack Obama because he has achieved Olympian greatness, omniscience. And, you know, given his record, having left a shambles on foreign policy, the worst recovery since the Second World War, he seems impervious to empirical evidence. The same view he had of himself upon obtaining the presidency he has today, and he is shocked, shocked, that the media won't bend a knee to him as they did in unison in 2008.WALLACE: Ron, do you think the president is -- has any merit, is right in any way when he says that the media in general and Fox in particular portray the poor as sponges, leaches, lazy, and undeserving?FOURNIER: No. But -- on a specific charge, no. On a general charge, is our institution in the midst of transformation? Is our institution too focused on cash and conflict and cliques, yes.But I would rather the president of the United States focus on his institution that is decaying and that he promised to fix and hasn't lifted one finger to fix. And if he wants to help fix the media, maybe he could stop being the enemy of the FOI, The Freedom of Information Act. Maybe he could stop being the enemy of whistleblowers. Maybe he could stop being the enemy of reporters like one who works for this organization that used whistleblowers to uncover the wrongdoings of his government.WALLACE: Steve, what do you think is going on here?HAYES: Well, I think basically the way that Josh Earnest treated that is taking an issue that was sort of a cheap shot from the president. He just wanted to throw an elbow and I think he wanted to mischaracterize the conversation and pretend that conservatives don't care about poverty.But the missed opportunity there is that he was on stage with Arthur Brooks who is the president of the American enterprise, has been studying poverty for year, has written books I highly recommend about innovative free market approaches to addressing poverty. And rather than engage in that intellectual debate, the president chooses to throw a cheap elbow at FOX News for laughs and titillate the left wing base of his party. It's a missed opportunity. But this is a presidency of missed opportunities. This is what he has done all along.WALLACE: I mean, the president's basic point, and this gets to kind of this larger issue, is he is saying that Republican leaders don't understand what poor people are going through because of the general narrative that's out there. And the question -- and that, therefore, they don't support his policies. And the question is the problem a matter of perception or is it a substantive difference about policy and what would help the poor the most?HAYES: No, I don't think the president ever let's it get to a substantial difference about policy because he doesn't take Republican ideas seriously. We saw this in healthcare, we are seeing it with poverty. Look what Paul Ryan has spent the better part of the past year doing. He has been going to places of poverty, both inner cities and rural areas, talking to people about solutions that are not government-driven solutions, aren't the same solutions that we have seen for 50 years that have failed.The president made clear in his speech in response to Baltimore that he wants to throw more money at poverty. We have done that. It hasn't worked. We are seeing the results every single day. And he is totally un- open to revisiting the idea, to looking at new possibilities.FOURNIER: You can debate with the sole motivation to win, which is what he does, or you can debate to try to find middle ground where you can actually accomplish something, which he doesn't do.WALLACE: We have a minute left. It's a big question. But to what degree is the real poverty problem? Is it a perception problem, and to what degree is a policy problem and the president is mistaking one for the other?KRAUTHAMMER: If you are a champion of the liberal approaches to poverty, starting with the war on poverty, which not only wasted trillions of dollars but actually undermined the very communities it was trying to help, if you are the advocate of that policy, you have to blame it on perception because you can't defend the policy. And it's the classic perception, sort of the central axiom of American politics, conservatives think that liberals are dumb, well-meaning but dumb. But liberals believe that conservatives are evil. And Obama's statement is a perfect example of that. We enjoy throwing orphans into the snow, and that's why we end up with the cruel policies that conservatives advocate.WALLACE: That's it for the panel, but stay tuned to see a Mother's Day call gone horribly wrong.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, FOX HOST:  Breaking tonight, the 2016 GOP race comes full circle as the issue of illegal immigration explodes in a state that will be the last stop to the Republican nomination for president.  Welcome ""The Kelly File"" everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly.  We have seen some ugly campaign trail moments this year when angry Trump critics have tried to crash events and met in some cases some angry Trump fans in response.  A couple hundred turned out in Burlingame, California, just a few hours ago, pushing against police lines and shouting about the businessman.  But the spectacle that erupted outside of Trump's rally in Orange County last night, that looked like something right out of a movie.  Watch.  Some 17 people were arrested as protesters scaled traffic lights, buildings and physically fought with Trump supporters.  After a rally where Trump doubled down on the dangers of illegal immigration and reiterated his call to build a wall.  Inside the event, Trump drove his message home by surrounding himself with the families of Americans who have been killed by illegal immigrants.  And judging by the crowd's reactions, that message hit home.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  They all have a very similar story to tell.  And people that should have never been here, people that should have never been allowed to come over the border, and they come here like it's nothing.  They walk through it like it's just nothing.  And we're going to stop it and we're going to build a wall.  We're going to also -- we're going to also --   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)We can't have this, folks.  We don't have a country anymore.  You know, I'm looking at statistics where your crime numbers are so crazy they're going to through the roof.  So, we can't have it anymore.  We have to stop it. And you know, their lives are so important.  And your relatives' lives are so important.  Your boys, your girls, all of the people, they did not die in vain, believe me.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Trace Gallagher has more now from our West Coast Newsroom -- Trace.   TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Megyn, even before the rally, the tension level was very high outside the Pacific Amphitheater, you had Trump supporters and protesters taunting each other with police working to keep two sides apart.  Inside the theater, it was 18,000 strong and hundreds who could not get in.  And Donald Trump was not toning down his rhetoric one bit.  It was raucous inside but it was very peaceful.  Then the speech ended, the sunset and emotion rose.  Hundreds of protesters moved from the amphitheater to the streets, blocking traffic, even shutting down the entrance to a freeway.  Dozens of the trapped vehicles were driven by Trump supporters.  One man who got out of his car got into a confrontation, came away with a bloody face.  And as the protesters got more threatening, police donned riot gear with officers on horseback trying to disperse the crowd.  It did not work and the violence grew.  Bottles and rocks hurled at police, a patrol car window smashed, the car itself got pummeled.  Watch.  Many of the protesters carrying Mexican flags and posing for selfies said they came to rail against Trump's immigration policy and his remarks about Mexico sending rapists and drug dealers into the United States.  Costa Mesa police say they did not use force but they did make 17 arrests.  Listen to some of the reaction to one of those arrests.  (INAUDIBLE)(SCREAMS)And while the arrests and protests were going on outside the Pacific Amphitheater, Donald Trump was already making his way to Northern California to address the GOP State Convention -- Megyn.   KELLY:  Trace, thank you.  Inside that Trump event, the candidate was joined on stage by a number of people who had their loved ones killed by people in this country illegally.  One of the most powerful moments came when Trump handed the mic to a man who shared a story about his son, a high school football star, gunned down by illegal immigrants just steps from his home.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Just when I sat down, I heard two gunshots.  I remember saying, damn, I hope this boy not dead.  Called his phone.  He didn't answer.  Went outside.  Man in the street dead, shot in the head.  Couldn't believe it.  Even to this day I couldn't believe it.  You've got illegal aliens on a third gun charge, never been deported, was given the last one he had assault with a deadly weapon, battery on a peace officer, resisting arrest.  Put them in the county jail for eight months, let him out four months early.  Same day he got out, he was looking for blacks to kill because of the 18th Street gang I dedicated my life to my kids like we all do.  You know?And to see him land dead in the street and to hear that he was in the county jail and was released on a Saturday night, no supervision, nobody called I.C.E.  That's not fair as American citizens.  We demand Americans first.  We don't care.  We don't care about illegal aliens.  We don't care. Americans first.  I can't save my son, but Trump is here to save us all.  And like I said, he's going to give us real hope and real change.  Thank you!(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Rich Lowry is a Fox News contributor and editor of National Review. David Wohl is a Trump supporter and an attorney.  He was in the rally last night with Mr. Trump. Great to see you both.  RICH LOWRY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Hi, Megyn.KELLY:  So, the write-ups of Trump's event last night, Rich, by The L.A. Times says, he put his roughest edges on display, saying he doubled down on some of his most controversial statements, and felt I guess that he was pushing the immigration issue and the  issue about Muslims in a way that was provocative.  What say you?LOWRY:  Well, yes, it's provocative.  It's also brilliant gut-level, highly emotive politics.  You could not look at that spectacle last night both inside and outside the arena and not feel charged up.  Either pro or con. And I give Trump credit for having those families on that stage.  They deserved to be heard.  They've been ignored too much by ordinary politicians and by the press.  So all that's to the good.  The question I have is one, sincerity.  You know, Donald Trump in 2012 was criticizing Mitt Romney, nice, polite Mitt Romney, for being too tough on immigration and alienating to Hispanics.  Two, if Trump wins the nomination and loses to Hillary, which polls can change but every poll indicates that that's what's going to happen, it's going to be highly discrediting to a cause that a lot of us consider very important to get the illegal  immigration problem under control and adopt a tighter and more rational immigration policy.   KELLY:  David, as we look at video of what happened earlier today in Burlingame, California, when Trump spoke there.  You can see the passions run high, as they have for months now when it comes to Trump, for and against.  You were inside the rally.  I don't remember a rally in recent history where a politician has given such a platform to the victims of, you know, what is a serious problem in the country.  People here illegally who choose to commit major, terrible felonies against Americans.  That does happen.  It's not that they all do it.  It's that those who have fallen victim don't often get that kind of platform.  DAVID WOHL, TRUMP SUPPORTER:  Yes.  And Megyn that was a last-minute decision by Mr. Trump to bring them up in back of him to let them be heard. As you heard, the one gentleman who I was talking to before he spoke, I mean, there were tears in the crowd listening to what he had to say.  And Megyn, this was like a combination of mid-1980s Van Halen concert versus an extraordinary political rally where people were riveted to his every word. And Megyn, one of the problems Hillary Clinton is going to have is that Donald Trump at least in California is dissolving political parties.  I mean, I spoke to three women, registered Democrats, lifelong Democrats, who said they don't believe at this point that Hillary Clinton is a viable option.  They're voting for Donald Trump simply because they like his ideas, not because he's a Republican.  And that was transcendent throughout the crowd.  And afterwards, Megyn, I got to say, my daughter and I could not get out of the parking lot because of those 200 or so protesters who really weren't protesters.  They were criminal opportunists. There were some good protesters there, but these people just wanted to cause trouble.   KELLY:  There's Trump with your daughter.   WOHL:  So, that was awful, but the real story was the extraordinary rally, the extraordinary emotion.  And this tidal wave of momentum that Donald Trump is creating going into California.   KELLY:  I have question for you on that, Rich.  Because one thing we saw, we've seen in almost every election cycle but certainly in 2012, I remember covering the Mitt Romney rallies, and he, one of them had something like 70,000 people.  It was insane, so many people, enthusiasm.  And it was just something to behold.  And he got killed -- he got killed in that election. I mean, just Barack Obama slaughtered just him.  I'm talking politically, of course.  And so, can you really go by crowd enthusiasm as an indicator of what's likely to happen in the polling stations?LOWRY:  Well, not always, but it has been a pretty indicator so far, right? I mean, Trump has been drawing these huge crowds from the beginning and has been sweeping all the way through with some bumps on the road and maybe more to come.  You know, this thing isn't wrapped up yet.  But I think the problem for Trump and the potential threat to the party is that he hasn't figured out a way to light up.  About 40 percent of the Republican Party, in an extraordinary way because he obviously has this genius flare for the dramatic and for theater.  And that's extremely important in politics.  Obviously, politics is not just rationality and policy papers.  It's emotion and gut-level feelings.  So, he a's appealing to a lot of Republicans on that level.  And there's some Democrats as well.  But all the polls indicate that while Republicans are really attracted to this, there's so many other voters in the country who aren't.  They look at the spectacle last night and I agree with David, those protesters are goons. There's never any excuse for violence.  But they look at the whole Trump spectacle and they're just like, this is too much.  We don't like it.  It's not presidential.  You have 70 percent of women in some opinion polls disapproving of him.  That's going to be very hard for him to undo.   KELLY:  And David, I'll give you the last word.  Some 85 percent of Hispanics.  I mean, the numbers -- his disapproval numbers with Hispanics are at record levels.   WOHL:  And Hispanics were in that crowd in record numbers last night, Megyn.  I don't particularly buy the polls.  We have six months to go to the November election.  He has a tidal wave of momentum as I said.  And I think he'll going to bring people together.  KELLY:  But do you think, David, he is going to shift -- do you think -- my question for you is, do you think Trump is going to shift to the center on immigration once -- if you know, if he becomes the nominee?  You know, that would be extraordinary if he starts shifting on that.  That's his core issue.   WOHL:  Yes.  No, I don't think he's going to shift to the center, Megyn.  I think he's made his program, his platform very clear, that he wants just the laws that exist to be enforced.  And when people think about that, it's very common sense.  And people are on board with that.  You should have heard last night when he just brought up the issue, there were Latinos in the crowd cheering because it means something to them, too, to have their immigration laws enforced so their jobs and lives aren't affected as well.  (CROSSTALK)WOHL:  -- their beliefs about immigration.KELLY:  Yes.  Well, and the folks who have done it properly or are waiting to.  It's great to see you both.  Thanks, guys.  LOWRY:  Thanks, Megyn.WOHL:  Thank you, Megyn.  KELLY:  Well, with just 72 hours to go until the critical Indiana primary, there was big news today when Governor Mike Pence delivered an endorsement. Governor Mike Huckabee is next on what it means for Tuesday.   Plus, a number of critics hammered comedian Will Ferrell after reports that he was planning to play Ronald Reagan in a comedy about President Reagan's struggle with Alzheimer's.   Brian Kilmeade is here on what Farrell has now done in the face of the firestorm.  And then, after the North Carolina governor came on ""The Kelly File"" last night with his defense of the state's so-called bathroom law, we got a call from Montel Williams who offered a new argument on this issue.  He's here just ahead.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hate bill 2 is not a bathroom bill.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's right.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is not a bill to protect women and children from predators.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's right.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is a cynical attempt to pit supposedly Christian values against our families' best interests and our faith's highest morality.  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Breaking tonight with Indiana's make or break primary just a few days away, Hoosiers state Governor Mike Pence today announced he's endorsing Senator Ted Cruz.  But there was an interesting qualifier sort of.  Listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. MIKE PENCE, R-INDIANA:  I like and respect all three of the Republican candidates in the field.  I particularly want to commend Donald Trump, who I think has given voice to the frustration of millions of working Americans.  I'm not against anybody, but I will be voting for Ted Cruz in the upcoming Republican primary.  I think the man has shown the courage of his convictions.  But let me be very clear.  Right?  I urge every Hoosier to make up their own mind.  Whoever wins the Republican nomination for president of the United States I'm going to work my heart out to get elected this fall.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  What did you think?  Joining me now, a Republican governor who has handed out just a few endorsements in his day, Mike Huckabee.  Governor, good to see you.MIKE HUCKABEE, R-FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  I would have liked to have had some more.  KELLY:  Next time.  Ted Cruz has shown the courage of his convictions. Where is Mike Pence's courage of his convictions?  I mean, that was -- you tell me whether that was a lame endorsement.  HUCKABEE:  Well, it was like he put $5 on Cruz, $4 on Trump and $3 on Kasich just to make sure that he covered all his bets.  KELLY:  Right.HUCKABEE:  Look, his endorsement is a big thing for Ted Cruz.  I don't want to do anything to take that away from Cruz because to get the sitting governor of Indiana just before the election is a big deal.  But it was a very tepid endorsement.   KELLY:  He could have done better.   HUCKABEE:  About as tepid as one can get.   KELLY:  It's like, Governor, sell it a little, would you?  You don't have to complimenting my adversaries, right?  Before you endorse me.  That's what I would say if I were Ted Cruz.   HUCKABEE:  Yes.  I'm pretty sure that Ted was squirming in his chair as he listened to the first part of that and even wondering, is he about to maybe turn around and endorse Trump instead?  But in the end he made his endorsement.   KELLY:  Okay.  But here's my question for you.   HUCKABEE:  Because he was protecting himself politically.   KELLY:  Right.  Because he'll going to be up for a reelection battle himself.  But here's my question for you.  Today is the day he did the endorsement.  We all watch it.  We're in news.  We analyze it.  Regardless of how it went, Ted Cruz is going to be able to go out there Saturday, Sunday, Monday and tell voters, I have the endorsement of your governor, the governor stands with me.  So that will play well, no?HUCKABEE:  It will play well.  But Donald Trump gets to come out and say, I got Bobby Knight.  I mean, look, I'm sorry, but you can be a governor of a state, but whoever is your sports icon, that's the person who actually sometimes carries a whole lot more weight.  I used to tell Coach Frank Broyles at Arkansas I'm just a governor.  You're Frank Broyles.  You know, you're like a deity.  I'm just some, you know, lonely guy that they can kick around to the curb.  So it's not going to be that this Trumps, if you will, all the other endorsement because the Bobby Knight endorsement was, as Donald Trump would say, huge.   KELLY:  Quick question for you, Indiana.  If Ted Cruz wins it, if he wins it, do you think this goes to a contested convention?HUCKABEE:  Not necessarily.  I still think that the problem for Cruz is that Trump is going to be hundreds of delegates ahead, millions of votes ahead.  He's got more votes than Romney or McCain did when they got the nomination.  And it's just hard to say that, well, he shouldn't get the nomination.  And when I hear people say, but he's not getting all the Republicans.  Megyn, the point is he's getting a lot of people who aren't Republicans.  He's getting Democrats and Independents who are coming to vote for him.  And if you're going to win a general election, you can't win it with the narrowest of Republicans.  You have to win it with people who normally don't vote Republicans.  And that's what Trump is bringing to the table this time.  KELLY:  Governor, always great to see you.   HUCKABEE:  Thank you, Megyn.   KELLY:  Joining us now with more, Guy Benson, he's a Fox News contributor and political editor at FoxNews.com.  Guy, good to see you.  So you tell me.  Wouldn't you be like, sell it a little more?  Like come on, like you could list a few more things.  Why are you talking about Trump while you're endorsing me?  That's what I would be saying.   GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, it was lukewarm.  Let's use that word.  I was sitting there watching just sort of waiting like Governor Huckabee, all right, when is the endorsement coming?  And they say, well, I'm voting for Ted Cruz.  And he said some nice things.  He warmed up a little bit.  But I think it is absolutely true that, although, look, this is one full spectrum conservative endorsing another.  That's not the surprising thing.  But at the end of the day, Mike Pence is up for reelection this year in Indiana, and he did not want to needlessly inflame any significant chunk of his voting base, his electoral base in that state. So he really covered his bases and lavished praise upon Trump before saying, and, yes, I'm voting for Cruz.   KELLY:  Yes.  They say that Charlie Sykes the conservative radio host in Wisconsin is reporting that Governor Walker of Wisconsin pressured Mike Pence to really consider Cruz.  And that's perhaps what got him over the line on that.  Let me ask you whether you think this makes a difference in Indiana because I assume you agree -- you tell me if you don't -- that this is it for Ted Cruz.  He's got to win this state.   BENSON:  Yep.  Yes, I think that's right.  So, two points.  First of all, you'll hear from Trump people tonight, this doesn't matter, this is irrelevant.  Who cares?  Well, the fact is Donald Trump sought Mike Pence's endorsement and didn't get it.  So that's some self-serving revisionism right there.  As for the broader picture and this nominating contest, there's no sugar-coating it, Megyn.  This is a must-win election on Tuesday for Ted Cruz.  And look, if he were to draw it up the way he wanted, this is how it would be playing out.  He finally has the one-on-one contest he's been pining for against Donald Trump.  He's got the governor in his pocket.  He got a media bump with Carly Fiorina.  The list goes on.  This is a fairly conservative Midwestern state.  The stars are sort of aligning for Ted Cruz to pull off an upset. If he can do so, I think this thing is fought all the way through California and possibly beyond.  If not, if Donald Trump wins regardless of this little streak for Ted Cruz that he's on, I think it's all she wrote.   KELLY:  That's why everyone needs to watch Fox News on Tuesday night because --BENSON:  Indeed.   KELLY:  In a way, it could be the culmination of this election season. Guy, it's great to see you.   BENSON:  Thanks, Megyn.   KELLY: Well, there's also a new twist tonight in the controversy over Will Ferrell, President Reagan and plans to make a comedy about Mr. Reagan's Alzheimer's, because that's hilarious.  Plus, with protesters targeting Trump events in California, we've put together a focus group of supporters to talk about what could be a rough road ahead with critics and the party.  Stay tuned.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If the Republican Party care birthday what the people want, they'd be behind Trump at this point.  They're not behind Trump.  We are.  So you know what?  Screw them.  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)JACKIE IBANEZ, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Live from America's News Headquarters. I'm Jackie Ibanez.  Airbus grounding all flights of its H225 Super Puma helicopter following the fiery crash of one today off the coast of Norway. All 13 people on board were killed.  The chopper was ferrying passengers from an oil platform in the North Sea.  Witnesses say they saw the rotor blades breaking away from the chopper while it was still in the air.   A key witness at the murder trial of Dylann Roof testifies he planned a deadly shooting for more than six months.  Roof is charged with nine counts of murder at a Charleston, South Carolina Church.  Witness Joey Meek says, Roof told him he wanted to start a race war.  Meeks says, Roof had his gun and extra ammunition at the time and that had planned to kill himself after those shootings.  I'm Jackie Ibanez.  Now back to ""The Kelly File"" special.  ANNOUNCER:  From the World Headquarters of Fox News, it's ""The Kelly File"" with Megyn Kelly.   KELLY:  Developing tonight, just four days away from the Indiana Republican primary, there have been two days of protests outside of Donald Trump events in California.  This could continue for a while.  In moments, we'll be joined by pollster and Trump critic Ed Goeas on what this means for the last few primary contests you're watching.  But first we put together a focus group of Republican primary voters in Indiana who all say they are backing Donald Trump.  Pollster Frank Luntz was the moderator.  Watch.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER:  We have 23 people right now, all of them Trump supporters, most of them who attended a Trump rally just recently.  Can you explain to America what is so special about this man who has no political experience whatsoever?  And yet you guys like him so much.  Help me.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I don't get it still.  It's just -- I sit back and watch it and it amazes me.  But I can't explain it.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He says what we think.  We're out here, humans in the real world thinking the things are, maybe not always politically correct but he's saying, let's -- this guy.  He's got our backs.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I like him because he's a leader and what I want is somebody that is going to bring in the best people for every area.  I want him to bring in the best people to handle the wall, the immigration, ISIS, our trade deals.  And he names names and that's why I like him.  Because he's going to bring the best people in --    (CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's way simpler for me.  He's not a politician.  I am so ticked off at these politicians, these career politicians.   LUNTZ:  By the way, thank you for using that language.  (LAUGHTER)This is a family show, after all.   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Well, I would have used the other.  But, yes, it's like you watch these guys, they're there forever.  You know they're getting paid.  You know they're getting oiled.  You know they're making deals that are enhancing their own lives.  And you know what?  They don't care about us.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He's fearless.  He's absolutely fearless.  He'll say anything at any time, and he doesn't care.  LUNTZ:  But isn't that potentially too much?  Doesn't that give you some pause?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Sometimes.  But overall, I don't think so, because the truth is more important than anything.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think that probably all of us have seen him on television say something that all of us are going, that's what I think.  LUNTZ:  Such as?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He's truly speaking for us.  LUNTZ:  Such as?  (CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He wants America to be first.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Pick a topic.  Immigration.  Nobody wants to say it because everybody is too busy being politically correct.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  But you know what, I have no problem with immigrants, but you need to do it legally.  (CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He wants America to be first.  Put America first. Obama went on an apology tour and Hillary rode shotgun.  LUNTZ:  But is he qualified?  Will you sleep well at night knowing that he's.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.LUNTZ:  You think he's qualified?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  You need somebody with a brain who's got intelligence who can make decisions and hire the right people to educate him, not necessarily somebody who's been to college, and is trained in political science, who has no experience doing anything.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Shouldn't our government be run like a business?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Absolutely.  (CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Isn't that what it's supposed to do?  LUNTZ:  I want a show of hands.  How many of you believe that the national government in Washington should be run like a business?  Raise your hand.  So it should be all about profitability?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Results.  It should be about results.  I'm an executive, and my boss evaluates me on results.  The people in Washington, what do they accomplish?  We're $21 trillion in debt when Obama leaves office.  I would be fired for that.  LUNTZ:  Who here is angry at the Republican Party?  Keep your hands up if you're angry at the Republican Party.  I want to focus on the last seconds we have in this segment on what's wrong with the Republican Party.  Members of Congress, watch this show.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They focus on what the red herrings are.  They want us to worry -- I'm a gay Republican.  There's one in Indiana.  They want us to worry about where I pee.  That is not the issue, that is -- and Trump is above that.  He's worried about where we are in the world, not where I use the bathroom.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The RNC should be trying to unite the party right now.  Long ago, if this had been anyone else besides Trump, an outsider, they would be behind him as the front-runner.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This election cycle is a great example of how they ignore us.  Nobody even knew we didn't elect the people.  I don't think Trump knew and that's how genuine he is.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  For me it's very simple.  If the Republican Party cared about what the people want, they'd be behind Trump at this point. They're not behind Trump.  We are.  So you know what?  Screw them.  I mean, that's my thing.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Screw them.  (CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's like, if they change the rules or they do something when we go into this convention, that somehow like -- I don't know what the possibilities are, I don't know all the areas and the rules, but if they do something, I will vote for anybody, but the Republican nominee.  LUNTZ:  Who agrees with that?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I agree.  LUNTZ:  Raise your hands high if you agree with that.  (END VIDEO CLIP)MEGYN KELLY, THE KELLY FILE SHOW HOST:   Joining us now with a different perspective, Ed Goeas, president of the Tarrance Group and pollster with Our Principles PAC, which is reportedly spending at least a million dollars on ads in Indiana opposing Mr. Trump.  Ed, good to see you.  ED GOEAS, POLLSTER WITH OUR PRINCIPLES PAC:  Good to see you.  KELLY:  What do you make of that message, they love the fact that, quote, he'll say anything?  GOEAS:  Well, I've seen it all along.  You know, quite frankly, I understand it.  There's nothing surprising here.  I think the key word here is focus group of Trump voters.  You would see a much different story if you were looking at Cruz voters or certainly, if you were looking at Hillary voters.  And talking about what they would say about their candidates.  I think you know we've seen in this country that over two- thirds of the country has felt we are off on the wrong track for well over 14 years now.  So the frustration towards Washington, the frustration towards the direction of the country has been there Republican presidents, Democrat presidents, Republican Congress, Democrat Congress.  KELLY:  Right.  GOEAS:  So that very clearly is there.  I think the thing for what we see in the Trump voters is what we saw initially, is you had about a third of the Republicans who very quickly, very intensely liked what he had to say, much like what you're hearing in this focus group.  (CROSSTALK)KELLY:  It's gone up from a third now, though.  It's creeping up above a third now.  GOEAS:  Well, if you look at his popular votes today, including the last two weeks, a very big victory, he is still below 40 percent of the Republicans voting for him.  Now, all the Trump people are going to say, well, I'm for him, I think everyone is.  But the bottom-line is, he started off with also a third that kind of questioned him, his style, his character.  And through recent months, their intensity has gone up, this threat of my voters are going to walk away if I'm the nominee.  We're now between a rock and a hard place that we also have a large number of Republicans that are saying I'll walk away if he is the nominee.  And when you look at the national numbers on where he is on his favorable and unfavorable, he's gone from 55 percent up to 65 percent.  KELLY:  What do you make of that?  We talked earlier about his deficit with Hispanics, with women as well.  I mean, what are you seeing when it comes to how he's doing with those groups?  GOEAS:  Well, I mean, they are -- Hispanics, they are close to 90 percent unfavorable at this point, African-Americans are off the chart.  You can't find anyone favorable towards him.  With women, he is over a 2 to 1.  If you look at the ballot with Hillary Clinton, he's losing by 19 points to Hillary Clinton with women.  So these negatives have come up, even those Republicans or those voters who are voting for him at this point, 28 percent are unfavorable, 12 percent are strongly unfavorable.  (CROSSTALK)KELLY:  But isn't he doing better with married women?  Hasn't he made headway with married women?  GOEAS:  He's still -- he's still upside down with women in terms of favorable and unfavorable.  He's losing to Hillary with married women. That is a group we always win by 7, 8, 9, 10 points.  If you look at white married women, we win by 15 points or more.  It's always the goal of what we're looking for.  A large part of that group that turned very negative towards him in the beginning and he's only added negative brush strokes to that picture, are those women who have reacted very strongly.  KELLY:   Ed, it's going to be an interesting few months.  It is great to see you.  GOEAS:  It will.  Thank you very much, Megyn.  KELLY:  So in the four weeks since North Carolina, passed its so-called bathroom law a debate has raged from Charlotte to California.  Tonight, Montel Williams weighs in on why he thinks this could end up hurting conservatives in November.  Plus, have you seen this?  Former New York Congressman Anthony Weiner and his wife decided to give documentary filmmakers remarkable access into their professional and personal lives.  We'll show you how that looks when Brian Kilmeade joins us, next.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is the worst, doing a documentary on my scandal. Hi!(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Well, in the four weeks since North Carolina passed its so-called bathroom law, liberal critics across the country have attacked it as discrimination against transgender people and some conservatives and independents say the law does not square up with their values.  They don't believe it goes far enough.  Last night North Carolina's governor came on The Kelly File to defend the law.  Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PAT MCCRORY, NORTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR:  I don't like the rhetoric that's often used on the right saying what the fear is.  It's a basic expectation of privacy that I hear from mom and dad and families that when their daughter or son goes into a facility, a restroom, they expect people of that gender, of that biological sex or gender, to be the only other ones in that.  That's the expectations that we've had for many, many years.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Joining me now with more, Montel Williams, former naval intelligence officer and activist.  Great to see you, Montel.MONTEL WILLIAMS, FORMER NAVAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER:  Great to see you.  KELLY:  Why are you shaking your head?  WILLIAMS:  This is all a ruse.  What the Republican Party has to understand is that taking a bill, this HB-2, and there are discussions about bathrooms.  KELLY:  Basically, it just says the part we were discussing there, if you're transgendered, you can't use the bathroom of choice.  You have to use the bathroom of the sex that you were born with basically.  WILLIAMS:  And therefore, if you go to North Carolina, you have to carry your birth certificate with you because that's the only way to validate your sex.  KELLY:  I know.  Is there a potty police?  WILLIAMS:  I think someone will be standing outside to ask us to pull down our pants.  KELLY:  Talk about invasion of privacy.  WILLIAMS:  There you go.  That's one.  And the number two, there are three other articles here, the anti-discrimination nation, the ability to sue.  (CROSSTALK)KELLY:  This is a different part of the bill, that has gotten less attention, the law.WILLIAMS:  No one is talking about it.  That's one.KELLY:  Explain that.  WILLIAMS:  It's a part of the bill that will not allow anyone to sue the state of North Carolina for discrimination in any of the contracts that they sign.  Two.KELLY:  If they're gay, they've been discriminated against based on their sexual orientation.  WILLIAMS:  Oh, no.  The language is so broad, this could be misinterpreted to say black, Hispanic, Asian, woman.  KELLY:  That would be thrown right out.  That would be clearly unconstitutional.  WILLIAMS:  But nobody is talking about it.  If you look at the other tenet, which says even in businesses, I can't sue you in the state of North Carolina for discriminating against me, if you don't allow I and my wife who happens to be Caucasian to get a room at your hotel.  I can't sue in North Carolina.  They're saying look, the remedies are there because in federal law you can sue.  But how many people can afford a federal lawsuit? And the last one is they slipped in a cap to the minimum wage.  So North Carolina has got a bill that basically now says, no matter what the minimum wage is in the rest the country, you are capped.  Two, anybody coming to your state can't sue if they feel they're discriminated against at state law level.  KELLY:  There are questions about those insertions on the discrimination law.  That's been settled for a long time.  WILLIAMS:  Sure.  KELLY:  But I want to ask you because do you think -- I mean, Ted Cruz loves this issue.  He's been exploiting it, he's been distinguishing himself from Trump saying Donald Trump thinks it's appropriate for a grown man to go into a little girl's bathroom and talking about how horrific this would be for our daughters and so on.  He clearly thinks he's on to something.  WILLIAMS:  Right here, Megyn.  Morgan Stabler (ph) and Michael Hughes (ph), which is which?  OK.KELLY:  Uh-huh.WILLIAMS:  This is Michael Hughes, but Michael was born a female.  Now, is Michael now supposed to walk into the women's bathroom and tell me that you're going to like to see Michael standing there or in my case, Morgan who was born a male, and this is Morgan now.  So Morgan now has to walk into the men's bathroom and do what?  We don't know what her anatomy is. When she washes out, someone will inspect to see if she's -- stop the stupid.  Both of these guys claim to be Christian moralists.  What is the basic premise of every religion on this planet?  You get judged by what you do for the least of us when you pass on.  How dare you try to judge them now on this planet and claim to be a Christian?  You can't have it both ways.  You can't.  KELLY:  Montel, it's great to see you.  WILLIAMS:  Good to see you.KELLY:   Thanks for being here.WILLIAMS:  Thanks, Megyn.  KELLY:  So it seems Hillary Clinton has found a new way to court women voters this November, introducing the woman card.  This exists.  It actually exists.  And Brian Kilmeade has some thoughts on this next.  Plus, there's a new documentary coming on Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal.  And we'll give you your first sneak peek next.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm going to try to talk about the issue facing New York City.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't push!UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh, my God.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't think I need the press the finger.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Developing tonight, there's a new twist in the controversy that exploded when reports surfaced that comedian Will Ferrell was planning to act in a comedy based on President Reagan and his struggle with Alzheimer's.  After growing backlash including angry letters from the Reagan children, Ferrell announced he's no longer going to be involved. Brian Kilmeade is the co-host Fox and Friends, and the host of Kilmeade and Friends on Fox News radio.  Good to see you.  BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX AND FRIENDS SHOW CO-HOST:  Great to see, Megyn.  KELLY:  So he's out.  KILMEADE:  He's out.  It was announced a couple hours ago, it happened earlier, after the uproar about it.  It became clear, not only was the average American upset by this, but the Reagan family was upset by this.  And you found out that Will Ferrell not only was going to star as Ronald Reagan, he was going to produce it.  So to say he looks at a bunch of projects, which was the release and this is just one he was looking at, I think it was a little disingenuous.  What I find really compelling about the story and confusing which makes me think the whole story hasn't come out, is this was written up in one of the Hollywood magazines, said the script was popular following its announcement.  It made it to this thing called the blacklist.  I don't know anything about movies, but the blacklist is an annual catalog of unproduced scripts in Hollywood. Everyone was excited about it.  To be on the blacklist, everyone in Hollywood thinks it's going to make a lot of money.  In fact, they had a table read with Lena Dunham and (Inaudible).  Lena Dunham was going to star as Peggy Noonan.  So there was a buzz about it.KELLY:  This is a hilarious idea?  KILMEADE:  Yeah.  It's unbelievable because they were going to make it and the premise was that Ronald Reagan in his final years had Alzheimer's dementia, and he was going to be told by an intern you should act like the president.  And that's where the laughs would begin.  I thought this was really compelling that Patty Davis wrote.  She said in hearing about the script, I watched in fear as fear invaded my father's eyes.  This man was never afraid of anything.  I heard his voice tremble as he stood in the living room and said, I don't know where I am.  I don't know where you fit the laugh track in that because that's the reality.KELLY:  Absolutely right.  I don't care what you think of Reagan, this is obviously not being made by fans of his.  (CROSSTALK)KELLY:  How about people who suffer from also Alzheimer's or dementia.  KILMEADE:  Right.  KELLY:  OK.  So let's move on to the next topic, Hillary is literally playing the woman card after Trump accused her of now she has one.  It looks like a subway card, which we all know she cannot use.  KILMEADE:  Right.KELLY:  She can use this one though.  KILMEADE:  She's using it to raise money.  Donald Trump came right out saying what everyone is thinking and knowing.  If you watch Hillary Clinton dating back to 2008, she always says wouldn't it be great to have a first woman president?  And you know, she always says it over and over again from Barack Obama to when she's guesting on Ellen, to when she's standing up against Bernie Sanders she'll bring up the fact she's a woman and is going to be the first.  So Donald Trump has a tendency to say what's on his mind. I don't know if you heard that.KELLY:  I'm not aware of that.  KILMEADE:  Right.  You know, I can see some tapes.  (LAUGHTER)KILMEADE:  And he says flat-out, she's going to play the woman's card. She'd get 5 percent approval without the woman.  She's embracing it.  Now, she's using it as a fund-raiser.  My sense is this is an overreach, an overstep.  I think in one way, even though all the experts disagree with me and they have color charts and bar graphs, so they must know what they're talking about.  KELLY:  And political science education.  KILMEADE:  Right.  I know you hate sports analogies.  But bear with me.  KELLY:  OK.KILMEADE:  If a defensive lineman looks at the offensive lineman tells the ref, watch, he holds.  That ref is going to look all game to see if the offensive lineman is going to hold, even though he's not supposed to.  So now, he's saying watch, she's going to play the women's card.  You know what's going to happen?  Every time she brings it up, he's going to play the woman's card, he is going to neutralize the whole thing.  It's hard to go against his school thought because of.(CROSSTALK)KELLY:  She doesn't have to do it because we know she's a woman, so no further explanation is required.  KILMEADE:  Right.  And she's Hillary.  KELLY:  Now, my old friend Anthony Weiner.  KILMEADE:  Right.  KELLY:  In the midst of his scandal was allowing a documentary to be made and thereafter, at least, was allowing a documentary to be made about his wife.  Here's a clip.  Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Running for mayor is the straightest line to clean up the mess that I had made.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Real scumbag.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Takes one to know one, jackass.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Why do you just walk?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There's no chance to win anymore.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's really apocalyptic right now.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  At a certain point, you've got to say, look, I don't quite.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  What?  Tell us.  KILMEADE:  Just to refresh your memory, he got into a scandal, he had to resign his commission.  He lied to say he wasn't involved with sending out pictures of his pants and what was in his pants.  KELLY:  Yeah.  (CROSSTALK)KELLY:  The naked pictures.  KILMEADE:  Right.  They are naked without his pants.  He said, I have an idea, I'm going to run for mayor.  Yet he was still doing all this, the chicanery.  So at the same time, Edgeline Films approached him and said why don't we do a documentary about your quest for redemption?  We know that he failed miserably in that.  I see this for two and a half minutes, you can't take your eyes off it.  (CROSSTALK)KILMEADE:  It's unbelievable that he's doing this.  If this was a scripted show, something we'd see on HBO, I'd go OK, it's pretty good.  It's not realistic, but it's good.  This happened.  KELLY:  Right.  KILMEADE:  This is somebody -- Edgeline Films is very experienced, it did Saddam Hussein's trial, and everything, but...  KELLY:  Where do we see it?  KILMEADE:  Right now, it's just airing in shows.  It's going to come to a theater near you shortly.  KELLY:  Oh, we have to pay like a theater to see it?KILMEADE:  Yeah, right now, it is up for an award.KELLY:  I don't know if I want to be seen in a movie theater consuming it. I'd definitely download it.(CROSSTALK)KILMEADE:  And deny it.  Download it and deny it.  This is just crazy, the audacity of someone saying bring it on again and filming, knowing he was still tweeting things that got him in trouble to begin with.  KELLY:  Well, he thought nobody would find out again.  KILMEADE:  Right.  KELLY:  And they did.  KILMEADE:  They did.  KELLY:  Now, we all know.  KILMEADE:  The magic of social media.  KELLY:  That's right.  And now, it's official that his political career has ended.  He's admitted that, himself.  And fair thee well, Anthony Weiner, as well as you, Brian Kilmeade.  Thank you for being here.  KILMEADE:  That's pretty much my exit line, isn't it?  KELLY:  Bye.  KILMEADE:  Bye.KELLY:  We'll be right back.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY:  Will you go see the Anthony Weiner movie?  Let me know on Facebook.com/theKellyFile or on Twitter @MegynKelly.  Thanks for watching, everybody.  I'm Megyn Kelly.  This right here is The Kelly File.  Have a great weekend.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" May 12, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)JAY CARNEY, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It was explicitly not about Benghazi. It was about the overall situation in the region, the Muslim world.MICHAEL MORELL, FORMER CIA ACTING DIRECTOR: I don't believe that.BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: It was about Benghazi.MORELL: I believe it was about Benghazi because the second tick in those talking points was something to the order of, we need to -- we need to bring to justice those people who have harmed Americans. And the only place that happened was Benghazi.BAIER: So, when the White House talked about that, they were lying?MORELL: ""Lying"" is a strong word. I didn't believe what they were saying.I think the line in there that says one of our objectives here right on the Sunday show is to blame the video rather than a failure of policy.I think that that is crossing the line between national security and politics. Were they intentionally lying? I don't know. I don't know. You have to ask them.KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS: Yesterday he said Jay misled the public and reporters in suggesting that that memo was not politicized. Was he lying then or is he lying now?EARNEST: Well, again, I you think that the point that Mr. Morell makes in his book is the relevant one, which is that it is false to suggest that this thing has been politicized, this tragedy had been politicized by the administration. I think unfortunately we have seen some -- again, as Mr. Morell says -- some who have sought to, rather cynically, try to score political points by politicizing what is a legitimate tragedy. And that's unfortunate.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Well, the reaction to Mike Morell's interview. He has got a new book out talking about Benghazi. And there specifically about the talking points and the White House version of the talking points that steered Susan Rice to those five Sunday talk shows. We are back with the panel. Steve, overall, the interview and this specific point?STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Well, I think on that specific point you get sort of a window into the problem with Mike Morell and what is he trying to do now. Mike Morell is trying to rewrite history on Benghazi, particularly with respect to his role. And, frankly, if I were Mike Morell and I had his history on Benghazi, I would want to rewrite it too. But the problem is what he has done in rewriting it in his interview with you and his interviews elsewhere and in his book is as misleading as his original role was on Benghazi. And I will give you two examples. We can talk about this for an hour but I don't think Greta wants to give up the next hour.BAIER: She doesn't.HAYES: So two examples. One, he complains bitterly in the book about cherry-picking. He says, well, my critics are cherry-picking and taking some information that supports their case and leaving out stuff that doesn't support their case. He does the exact same thing, and he does it throughout an entire two chapters on Benghazi. He did it in his interview with you. One specific example was when we were talking about or when he writes about whether this was a preplanned attack or not. Well, you interviewed the CIA contractors had who wrote the book ""13 Hours,"" and they said there had been surveillance of the facility. And in their book they wrote that that surveillance sent them into high alert. It was a big deal. They were casing the facility hours before the attack. It doesn't appear in Mike Morell's book. He simply leaves it out.You can have questions about what they say. You don't have to agree with what they say. But you can't just set it aside. And that's what he does repeatedly.The other example is your exchange with him on Abu Khattala in the indictment, and, again, whether this was a preplanned attack. He seemed utterly unfamiliar with the specifics of that indictment. He says, well, it wasn't clear that they were attackers. It wasn't clear that they wanted to hurt anybody. It wasn't clear really what they were doing. The indictment very specifically and repeatedly five different times says they came there to kill. Abu Khattala knew that this was a CIA facility. He knew that this was under CIA cover. He wanted to go in and kill Americans because he thought what they were doing, he thought their intelligence activities there were illegal, very specific language, presumably based on intelligence that we have gathered. And he sort of shrugged that off when you asked him about it. Well, you can't shrug it off.And I guess the final question I would have is don't we deserve something better in this country than to have intelligence professionals who mislead as a matter of course, who did it at the time, who do it in their book, who do it in interviews, and shouldn't we expect that our intelligence professionals would tell the truth and be straight with the American people?BAIER: OK. A.B.?A.B. STODDARD, THE HILL: Well, I mean, Steve is right. This man's credibility has been questioned now going back years. He was accused by Republican senators of lying in his Congressional testimony. And it is true that it's -- it doesn't make a lot of sense that he sees it both as a spontaneous event, but one that was a terrorist attack. So that was sort of confusing.I think going forward, if nothing else happens to Hillary Clinton on Benghazi, the fact that an Obama administration official said that the State Department failed to protect that ambassador and those three other men is a big deal and will follow her in the campaign.BAIER: You weighed in last night, but the biggest thing out of all of this?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: He comes out as an unreliable witness, a man who appears to have been over his head and is now covering his tracks.BAIER: That's it for the panel. But stay tuned for a look at one candidate's awkward moments.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight after a presidential campaign unlike any other we are finally less than 24-hours away from the first of the nation's caucuses. When Iowa voters will have their say in the process to elect the next president of the United States.Welcome to ""The Kelly File"" everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly, live her in Des Moines, Iowa. It's happening.By this time tomorrow night the caucuses will be well underway. And tonight the candidates are crisscrossing the state in an effort to shore up support. The latest polling out of Iowa shows a real battle at the top, look at this. According to the Des Moines Register, Donald Trump in the lead at 28 percent, Ted Cruz follows at 23 percent. And this represents a shift in the race because last month the same poll had Ted Cruz with a 10 point advantage over Donald Trump.Still, a lot could change overnight because 45 percent of Iowa voters say they could still be persuaded to support another candidate. That's how it works with the caucuses. So it is anybody's guess. We have a big show for you on tap tonight. Plus, we will get analysis from Chris Stirewalt and Howe Kurtz.We will also speak to presidential candidate Rand Paul about his strategy, and Iowa Congressman Steve King is here to discuss the politics at play in his home state. But we begin tonight with Frank Luntz and a focus group of Iowa voters. Watch this.FRANK LUNTZ, POLITICAL CONSULTANT: Megyn, all eyes are on Iowa and on caucus voters just like this right here because every one of them has changed who they support within the last 48 hours. In fact, watch his, how many of you could change back and might go to someone else? Raise your hands. What is wrong with these people? How long does it take?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You know, we have so many. The field is so big, there are so many issues and more things keep coming out. And especially in the last debate without Donald Trump there, you saw other candidates able to come up and rise to the top and give you a different impression of them.LUNTZ: So I got to ask, was that actually a positive not having Trump there? Did you feel like you learned more?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.LUNTZ: You're nodding your head. Tell me why?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Absolutely, because I feel like when Trump speaks it's a circus and it's all about being a bully and trying to get everybody, you know, just attack, attack, attack. Where this time it was all about the issues. And everybody got more of a fair chance to speak, than some of the other debates.LUNTZ: I know some of you like Trump. So, you're nodding your head.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah, I switched to Trump. As a small business owner I think he gives me the best chance to better my business and leave a legacy for my family.LUNTZ: And what gave you that impression over the last 48-hours that you didn't have before?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because I really delved into the financial and fiscal policies of Donald Trump, and being a business owner himself and having time to research it over the weekend and -- into the weekend gave me a chance to look and say he's not going to penalize me for being the best business owner I can be.LUNTZ: What caused you to shift? What caused to flip from one to another?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well over the last three days I've really gone from Trump, then we watched the debate where he didn't show up, and I was a huge Cruz supporter, I've seen him in person. And then after Megyn Kelly showed that video of his bill and amendment he brought it down to 38 words, you know, and kept going back and forth with that, I just didn't see him as honest anymore so now I'm with Marco Rubio.LUNTZ: So you went through three different candidates in the last 48- hours.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yup.LUNTZ: There's a word for that, I don't know what it is.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's not flip-flopping.LUNTZ: But there's a world for that. And how likely are, you just stay with mark would Marco Rubio?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: 100 percent. I was actually able to see him in person last weekend and asked a direct question about my family and their security, and the way he answered it with my 10-year old with me, it made me really solidify why I would choose him as a candidate.LUNTZ: How many of you have meet a presidential candidate this election cycle, raise your hands. You see, where were you? Were you in like in Nebraska? 9 out of 10 of you met a Presidential candidate. I'm now curious. At some point in your life how many of you have actually met and maybe even before they became president, who you actually met someone who became president, raise your hands? 5 out of 10. Only in Iowa. So, you haven't gone to any rally?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, no. I work -- I own my own company so I work a lot. So, I do watch a lot on T.V. I've been between Cruz and Trump a lot.  Back and forth, back and forth. And I will say I have a lot of respect for Trump in the aspect of, he went against the norm and held his own rally and people lined up. I was watching it on the news. People were lined up all of the way down the street to get in to see him.LUNTZ: And this vote is taking place in less than 24-hours. When did you settle?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've been back and forth even to this morning, I talked to my brother who is in the military. And he has been diehard Trump. And, you know, I was over his house this morning talking to him and going back and forth and going, you know, through how it's going to affect us.LUNTZ: And where are you now?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump.LUNTZ: So you actually switched from when we interviewed you?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.LUNTZ: I hate when people do that. Who are you choosing between?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I've done some flip-flopping too. I was, at the very beginning, a Carson, I think he's an up right man, I kind of moved toward Cruz and now I'm really moving toward Rubio. I am very impressed with Senator Rubio and the understanding when he speaks that he's giving Americans the importance of this election and how past generations have struggled and worked to make America great, and that we are going to continue to have those, but what kind of America are we? Are we going to move toward a socialized America or are we going to be the America that say the greatest generation was, and can we really as an America?LUNTZ: So Megyn I know that you are -- that people are concerned that Iowa is the first in the nation, that they cast the first votes and whether it is sophisticated enough. How much television do you watch? How much information have you collected?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I watch and read the news every single day of the week.LUNTZ: Have you seen every debate?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.LUNTZ: Every one, have you seen every hour of every debate?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah, I was at the debate.LUNTZ: You actually went live.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah.LUNTZ: Where did you start?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I started off as a Rand Paul supporter.LUNTZ: And now?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And, and now I am for Ted Cruz more as a protest vote against Donald Trump than anything else.LUNTZ: And what are you protesting?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I respectfully disagree with some of the comments here that he's not conservative. He's stated before that he wants a socialized medicine system beyond Obamacare and this country. He's flip-flopped on his positions many, many times over the years. And, I can't stand by and let that happen.LUNTZ: So what's more impactful to you, the debates, the ads or what you read in the newspaper?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The rallies.LUNTZ: The rallies.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I've been to several rallies and I've had candidates come to where I work and actually speak, and that's where you really get to know a candidate and their passion and what they believe in. And for me that's what people should do. They should go out and actually listen to the candidate speak instead of having to try to, you know, debate and fight each other because you really get a good clue who that person is.LUNTZ: So I got one more shot. Go ahead. Last comment.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm going to say the rallies are so important because if you can interact with them, you see their human character, what they believe in and why. Because that's the most important element that I find useful, because leadership is based on your character and insight.LUNTZ: So whose undecided still, who might switch, raise your hands? OK.  So very quickly, what advice would you give the candidates when they -- when you wake up in the morning what should they be saying to you tomorrow morning to get your vote tomorrow night?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's all about the debt. I haven't heard hardly anything about the debt on the Republican side.LUNTZ: Who you leaning towards now?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would say probably Rubio, protest vote like what he was saying. Trump is just -- you can't say bimbo regularly and it's not political correctness, it's just basic human decency.LUNTZ: I want to make the point, Megyn, that they're not talking necessarily about issues. There's a lot of conversation about the attributes of the candidate, we have to have the right policy but you also have to have the right persona. Back to you.KELLY: Amazing. Amazing Group Frank, thank you. And I don't know who has doubts about the Iowans but they should be removed now.Joining me with more, Jeff Kaufmann, the Chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa. Jeff, great to see you again.JEFF KAUFMANN, CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OF IOWA: Great to be back.KELLY: So insightful, so smart, so well-informed. I can't imagine what it's like to have a candidates showing up at your work. Oh wait, they do, where I work. But, you know, for regular folks it's -- I mean they've been saturated by these guys in their positions. What have you seen so far in terms of voter regulation? How big do you think the turnout is going to be?KAUFMANN: Well, just an hour, I think it's the first time I've said this to the press, just an hour ago, Republican Party of Iowa sent out a memo to all 1,681 precincts saying, you need to make more copies of materials you need. We, you know, we don't have any ...KELLY: The voting cards?KAUFMANN: Voting cards, the materials that you need for ...KELLY: Why did you do that?KAUFMANN: What we're hearing on the ground anecdotally, the weather looks like it's going to be cooperative in most of Iowa. It's, you know, it's more of a hunch than anything else. But, you know, you get a sense where you begin to feel it, and also, we are absolutely -- our phone is ringing off the hook. I mean 100 an hour approximately. To put that in perspective there's usually 4 or 5 an hour.KELLY: People trying to find out, where do I go? Where can I caucus?KAUFMANN: Everything, where -- caucus, how do I change my party? You name the questions they are asking us ...KELLY: So if you're a Democrat today and you want to caucus as a Republican tomorrow you can do it?KAUFMANN: Absolutely.KELLY: Wow. All right. So -- because not every state allows that but you bet it's possible here. What are you seeing in terms of momentum for the candidates? I mean, whose name keeps bubbling up now?KAUFMANN: I would say the top three according to the Des Moines Register Poll, I'm hearing a lot about Cruz and Trump. The angst that you just heard from some of the folks in terms of how they are going to settle and who they are going to vote for, we are hearing that a lot. Marco Rubio, we are hearing his name quite a bit. And, you know, to be honest with you, we still have people that are -- I mean, I can't think of any of the 11 candidates that today I haven't heard at least one Republican mention. I mean this thing is fluid.KELLY: But as a betting man, if you were a betting man, right? Because you go the river boat casinos not far. Would you put any money on the lower tier, the guys who are in the 2 percent? Do you think there's any chance we're going to see some big surprise from that level?KAUFMANN: Surprise, yes Megyn. I think -- remember, there's more than one ticket out of Iowa. And if you've got a person in 10th place and they make that jump to 5th place, that's a 4th ticket out of Iowa. You know, if you're count up to 5 tickets because they got momentum. They got something that they can take to New Hampshire.KELLY: Explain on the republican side, when they show up to caucus tomorrow night at, you know, 7:00, do they talk to each other, or is that only on the Democratic side. On the Republican side it's their chance to persuade?KAUFMANN: Yes. Almost every campaign will have somebody that will be at each of these 1,681 precincts that will speak for them. Sometimes that just happens organically, somebody will stand up and talk. And I'll tell you, never underestimate the power of that. I have heard so many stories over the year, the farmer, they never really heard him give a peep throughout the years, he stands up all of a sudden, he's moved to say something, that person has some power, that is more powerful than ads, more powerful than even the candidates.I mean that's the power of the Iowa caucus. It's such a neat process and that's why I promise you drama tomorrow.KELLY: Promise a drama, Jeff, thank you. Exciting.KAUFMANN: Just for you.KELLY: We're looking forward to it. Thanks for everything.Well, so you just heard the state's top Republican official predicting a big turnout. And results could be driven by how many voters show up.Brit Hume is next on what has turned into a very unpredictable vote.Plus, Stirewalt had been out all day talking with voters at churches, stores and diners. Stirewalt was at the diners. He'll bring us the ground troop.And then, Hillary Clinton is taking new heat tonight for her latest attempt to address the e-mail scandal looming over her campaign. We'll fact check her argument with one of the top national security lawyers in the country.  Wait until you hear what he's saying about her claims just ahead.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There is no classified marked information on those e-mails sent or received me.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Back now with a breaking news. From just a few moments ago, we heard it right here, the Iowa Republican Party Jeff Kaufmann, saying he expects GOP turnout to exceed 2012 numbers in 2012. We have been turnout could change the results in an election cycle that some pundits are calling less predictable than ever.Brit Hume is Fox News Senior Political Analyst, he joins us now. Brit good to see you. So, this is interesting because, according to the latest numbers Donald Trump has a 16-point lead among first-time caucus goers. If you ask all caucus goers including the experienced ones Cruz has a 3-point lead.BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes.KELLY: So if they are seeing a surge, he's not giving an actual number to it but he's saying they are telling them printout more materials. We need more.HUME: But I don't -- I think the polling suggests that Donald Trump does not need ...KELLY: He doesn't need it.HUME: A big surge from first-time voters.KELLY: But it would help him.HUME: It would he is leading among those who describe themselves as mainstream Republicans, which means if all things are equal or we get a normal or perhaps large turnout, he will be fine. And if there's a huge surge of new voters, he does very well among them, he could win going away.  So, you know, I think this poll is suggested it's going to be tough for one of his challengers to overtake him.KELLY: And speaking of which, Ted Cruz is on the record although he then dialed it back, but he's on record having said to a group privately that he believes Trump wins in Iowa because it looks like he's going to win New Hampshire then he'll be unstoppable. What do you think?HUME: Well that's a warning that he's giving, you know, a certainty -- one of the ways you can sometimes win over voters is to get them to be afraid of some other outcome, right? So, you say to the opponent, look this guy and they, you know, they're all listening to Cruz, right? This guy could be the nominee. You got to stop that. Vote for me. Look, I think it's not exactly true that if Trump wins here and Cruz failed to stop shim.  Cruz is badly hurt, right? Trump then goes on New Hampshire where he looks to be in very good shape, and that does creates a possibility where you have this bandwagon effect where you win the first two and then people thinking you're inevitable and then people start getting on the band wagon.  And then you run the table and you are the nominee.KELLY: Do you believe in the Rubio momentum? I think that's how they're calling it Rubio momentum.HUME: I think Rubio has got something going out here. And I think, for a while there his staff and team were trying to stir the pot a little bit to get people to say, you know I really wasn't thinking about Rubio because I didn't think he had a chance, but now, jeez, maybe he does, I'll vote for him. And if you take that too far and then you create expectations that he then failed to meet. No matter how you see it, he's losing which is always a danger in this game.KELLY: Politics is weird.HUME: It is indeed.KELLY: Great to see you Brit.HUME: Thanks Megyn.KELLY: More with Brit later. Joining us now as well, you know these guys.  Chris Stirewalt and Howard Kurtz are here, I want to talk to them immediately. Oh we have an introductory thought. Here it is. The reporters who have covered Iowa, they're very bossy in the control room.  We'll tell you that one of the best things to do is go out and talk to the people. The people.Chris Stirewalt and Howard Kurtz did that today, in a moment they'll tell us ...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What we learned more than anything else in doing this is how incredible, smart, committed the people of the United States are. It's incredible. They want to see America great again. It's very simple. They want to see our country be great again.SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We launched this campaign.  The New York sometimes promptly opine, Cruz cannot win, because the Washington elites despise him. I kind of thought that was the whole point of the campaign.SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: First thing I am going to do when I get to the oval office is I am going to repeal every single one of Barack Obama's unconstitutional executive orders. Every single one of them.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News Digital Politics Editor and Howard Kurtz, host of ""MediaBuzz"". Good to see you both.So what feeling are you getting?CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, you know, you got to do that terrible thing journalist do where you say, I talked to five people and now I know everything about all times. That whatever happened in Iowa ...KELLY: But you do hear a little buzz.STIREWALT: No you -- so you go to rallies. That's where you go to events and talk to people. I went to church today and I had the most interesting conversation. One of the preachers, afterwards he came to us, I love you on ""The Kelly File."" Tell Megyn I said hello, he's your demo (ph). And, I said who are you going to caucus for. This is a preacher, and they just been talking about love and forgiveness. And he said, well, I came down to Trump. I said why?And he said, it's just the anger, it is just the anger. And I thought if we are at a point where even a preacher, even a man of the cloth who's wearing his vestments ...KELLY: Maybe he liked it when Trump held up the bible?STIREWALT: No. I liked him angry. And, you know, what he said his second choice was? He said his second choice was Rubio and he hoped Rubio maybe might be the nominee. It would be if Rubio was the nominee but it was important for Iowa to tell the Republican Party that they're angry and Donald Trump matched it.KELLY: This is sort of one of those moments how we were -- we're going to find out whether all of the rhetoric we've been hearing about angry Republicans wanting a revolution, wanting to overturn things, you know, the system is real or not.STIREWALT: Just before coming over here I talked to a young women named Jenny who is trying to decide between Trump, Cruz and Rubio. And she plugged in, she was disappointed in Cruz over reports he only donated one percent of his income to the church, what happens to be the subject. Well how could be, and I talked to people, I am hearing a lot of good buzz will Rubio surprisingly but it's anecdotal. I've heard people swinging back and forth between Cruz and Rubio and Carly fan.And the situation is so fluid and where the caucus is being so convoluted, of course, even the best pollster can't capture, none of these campaigns know what's going on. That's why they were all kind of trying to downplay expectations.KELLY: So what persuade them, right? If 45 percent are still persuadable ...STIREWALT: Right.KELLY: With 24-hours left to go before the caucuses, what does it? What pushes them over the edge between now and tomorrow?STIREWALT: Well now, first of all, you know that some are lying. They're actually not persuaded ...KELLY: Why are they saying that?STIREWALT: Because they want to flatter themselves to say, well I can be ...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: They're considering all of the options.STIREWALT: They want to talk to me outside of church.KELLY: It could happen.STIREWALT: No, but look. The reality is Iowa wants to have you pay attention to it. I will want us here tonight. I will want us watching ...KELLY: They've won. They've won. What's your answer?STIREWALT: But the answer is this, and pretty simple. Ted Cruz has the organization. He has the ground game, he has the people. They are going to turnout for him. The rest of it with Rubio and Trump, it's about the feeling. It's about the vibe. It's about the flow. And people like to catch the flow.HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS HOST, ""MEDIABUZZ"": We pundits sometimes over analyze these things. One guy said he liked Trump because his brother was in the military. And he liked Trump, it's that sort of thing. I'll tell you one thing. The whole essence of the Iowa causes is, there's a retail campaigning going to coffee shops and state fairs. Donald Trump has basically done the big rallies and that seems to have worked. And he hasn't really done the 99 counties. If he wins I think blows up the model, I mean, it helps to be a billionaire of course, it blows up the model.KELLY: Who doesn't want a tour of the 757?KURTZ: Shaking one hand at a time. Because, it's become such a television campaign even in a state like Iowa that take this stuff seriously (ph).KELLY: It's going to be hard for anybody to replicate that. It's going to be hard for them to replicate Trump in any way. Good to see you both.KURTZ: Thanks. You bet.KELLY: So what if the polls are wrong? Senator Rand Paul is betting they are and he'll join us next to explain why and what it means.Plus, Donald Trump is making a big play for tomorrow's evangelical vote.  We'll show you the latest from him and the Iowa insider next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Well, at least one of the Republican candidates tonight is saying, don't believe the hype of the polls. Senator Rand Paul is currently sitting in 5th in the latest Des Moines register poll out of Iowa. But he today he told me the press there is one big group of voters that may not be showing up in any of the research. A group that he thinks could make for a big surprise when the results finally come in.Joining me is Senator Rand Paul. Senator, great to see you. So, why shouldn't we believe the polls?UNIDENTIFIED CROWD (chanting): President Paul.PAUL: I think some of the evidence is in the noise you hear behind me. We have over 1,000 kids tonight at the University of Iowa. We have an amazing amount of enthusiasm. The young people have called over a million people in Iowa.  We think we're going to surprise people. And we think maybe the day of the pollsters really being that accurate maybe gone. And that you may find something really surprising tomorrow night, particularly if all these kids show up and vote for me tomorrow.KELLY: It happened with your dad who was underestimated by some polls.PAUL: Yup. And he was here with me tonight. We had a big crowd. A lot of our family was here. And, we're looking for a strong finish. We think in the debate we pointed out some of the inconsistencies with the others.  And, I think actually Cruz's faltering at the very end here. And we think we're going to see a big rise at the end and also a lot of student turnout.KELLY: Who do you say is the main competition on the GOP side?PAUL: You know, I think it's a variety of folks. I think our votes, you know, when you look at first, second, third choices it can be a variety of things. But I think my voice is actually distinctive and I'm the only one saying, we don't need to, you know, make the sand glow over the Middle East, we don't need to be locking up a generation of young people for marijuana, and we don't need to be collecting all of their phone records.I think I'm the only one on the state saying that, so it provides for me, I think a distinct voice from all the others.KELLY: Now, which of those three positions do you think accounts for all the young people who we see behind you?PAUL: A lot of it is privacy. You know, I have three teenaged boys and they communicate with all of their friends, their family and everybody through their cell phone. They don't understand why the government would collect all of their phone records. But I will tell you, some of the loudest applause lines tonight were -- that I'm not going to send them to another war.KELLY: There we go (inaudible). Now, you know, the conventional wisdom is, there are three tickets out of Iowa, you know, it's going to be -- they say according today's polls is Cruz, Trump, Rubio, do you reject that theory? Do you also believe whoever is in the three, that there are only three tickets out?PAUL: You know I think in a big field, there will be a winnowing effect.  I think those who joined to out in Iowa probably won't go on. But I don't think it there's an exact number of candidates. You know, many of the candidates that we're almost assure they are going to be, Bush, Kasich, Christie, they're probably going on to New Hampshire. So I don't know if there's an exact number of tickets because many people are placing more emphasis on New Hampshire than in Iowa.But I can tell you that if you don't do well, you don't appear to be rising in Iowa you won't do very well New Hampshire. So for those who were banking on New Hampshire of bringing them back after doing poorly here in Iowa, I think it's difficult because there is definitely is momentum and there is a roller coaster ride that you can ride out of Iowa and we plan on being right there on the wave.KELLY: There you have it, Senator Rand Paul with the prediction that he will be ahead of Christie, and I -- I think is it Carson was that the last one? We're going to hold you down, we're going to hold you for that and rerun (ph) the tape we. Thank you for being here tonight and all the best to you. Good night.With the first to Sanders verses Clinton showdown coming tomorrow. Mrs. Clinton is again trying to explain her e-mail scandal that's been hanging over her campaign. We have a fact check of her claims with one of the top national security lawyers in the country who knows a lot about what's classified and what's not.Plus, on the Republican side, a new battle is breaking out in the fight for evangelical voters. Iowa Congressman Steve King is live with us next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight in the final hours before the Iowa caucuses.  Republican frontrunner Donald Trump is taking to facebook to appeal to evangelical voters. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I really appreciate the support given to me by the evangelicals.  They've been incredible, every poll shows how well I'm doing with them.  And, you know, my mother gave me this bible, this very bible many years ago. In fact it's her writing right here. She wrote the name and my address. And it's just very special to me. And, again, I want to thank the evangelicals. I will never let you down.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Our next guess is Steve King, he's an Iowa Congressman and a Republican and he's backing Texas Senator Ted Cruz for president. Great to see you Congressman.REP. STEVE KING, R-IOWA: Good to be, thank you Megyn.KELLY: How do you fell about Ted Cruz's chances?KING: Well I think they're good. I think it's going to be very close to a photo finish. And, I'm in print this prediction that it's a bits of binary decision for the voters who have come out, now is it Trump or Cruz, Cruz or Trump. And the people that are in this, we need to send a thank you to the to the others and, either vote for Cruz if you don't, it's a vote for Trump.KELLY: What makes the difference? Why? I mean, for those people who are still struggling with that decision?KING: Well, I think the difference is, that the poll say, that it's head to head, that way, and so the people that are loyal to, say Huckabee and Santorum, maybe Carson, they're -- it's nice that they worked all of this.  We are thankful that they're candidates, but it's to the point now where, we have an opportunity to advance a full spectrum constitutional Christian conservative to the White House who understands the Article 3 and will make the appointments to the Supreme Court and the right appointment to the court, and that will direct the destiny of the country in a positive direction.And, I think that's a decision and, with the evangelical commercial here, I just heard Donald Trump's speech before Liberty University, I saw it live, and he used a couple words of profanity that are prohibited on the campus along with the way he referenced the bible. So, I think that voice doesn't resinate quite the way he may wish it does.KELLY: Well, why do you think he is doing so well be evangelicals? The Fox News Poll, latest one shows Ted Cruz got 31 percent, Donald Trump very close behind with 29 percent, Marco Rubio with 10 percent, and the Des Moines Register Poll shows that 47 percent of Iowans are evangelicals, the voters, they're evenly divided between those two top men.KING: That polling sounds like a dead heat. But, you know, I think I know the people her in Iowa and I have represent Northwest and most of North Central Iowa. And, they are driven by the values of life and marriage and religious liberty and constitutional values. And, you know, Donald Trump's record doesn't support that.So he makes a compelling argument here and he's running a commercial right at them. But, Ted Cruz's life does support that, his life from little on up where he was spoon fed the bible and the constitution at the kitchen table. I was spoon fed the code of Iowa and the constitution and my bible was on the end table. I understand what that means it goes in your bones.  It's a conviction, it's been it's like memorize the constitution and taught it and debated it all over Texas in high school, and then went off to law school and demonstrated his commitment to the constitutional and religious principles.And everybody they fought (ph), nine times before the United States Supreme Court. And if there are going to be two, three or maybe even four appointments to the United States Supreme Court are coming up for the next president of the United States we better have a president that gets that right, that understands that or our constitution will be obliterated by (inaudible).KELLY: So what's make the difference? What makes a difference, turnout?KING: The difference is the turnout. And, that the turnout -- we don't really know at this point, but, I would say this, I don't want to put a little over -- number out there for viewers. I'm going to pick 135,000.KELLY: Its 122 last time around.KING: Yes, so this will be a record by 13,000 or so. And so, even with a record turnout, I think if it is 135,000 or less Ted Cruz wins in Iowa. If that number soars above there in a significant way, then I think it's Donald Trump and he will have accomplished something we have never seen before which would be this amazing turnout of people that have never gone to caucus before. That's a tough task.KELLY: Congressman Steve King, fascinating insight. Thank you sir.KING: It is.KELLY: Good to see you.KING: Good to see you, Thank you Megyn.KELLY: Well Donald Trump has appeal to a lot of voters with his top talk on immigration but in a ""New York Times"" editorial this weekend, the ""Times"" suggested that Mr. Trump uses his promise of a wall as a tactic to rile up voters.Writing, ""At a meeting with the Times's editorial writers, Mr. Trump talks about the art of applause lines. You know, he said of his events, if it gets a little boring, if I see people starting to sort of maybe thinking about leaving, I can sort of tell the audience, I just say, ""We will build the wall"" and they go nuts.""David Wohl is an attorney and a big Trump supporter. David, good to see you.So the Times is clearly trying to take a shot at Trump with that suggesting it maybe it's not heartfelt he is just using it to rile people up. You buy that?DAVID WOHL, ATTORNEY AND TRUMP SUPPORTER: Right. Well, when you say this, it's hard to find at least for me a bored person at a Trump rally, so I'm not sure if that ever happens.But yeah, you know what? I think that the reality is the wall at this point is more than a physical object. When he refers the wall but the wall he wants to build and build Mexico for to stop immigrants and terrorists.  It's also -- Megyn, I've got to say it's a symbol.It's a symbol of regaining control over America on economic or political or social level. It's something that we haven't had the last seven years and it's something that is really appealing.So I think that when he mentions that, people just jump on and say, ""Yes.""  For once, it's the iron fist approach rather than the pretty please approach. So that's why it's so appealing right now.KELLY: What do you make of -- earlier in the show, we had a Frank Luntz focus group. And one guy was saying, you know, an Iowan saying, ""I don't like the language he uses. I don't like the language about women, et cetera. And for me that's was -- that's a turnoff"", he said. Does that bother you?WOHL: Well, I think Megyn a lot of rock stars, very successful people, very talented genius people have eccentricities and I think that's one of his and saying, off the cuff -- of off the cuff remarks that do offend people from time to time. I think, if he could take them back, I think he would. But that's just part of his appeal. He's so, so out of the ordinary Megyn, so unorthodox that people grab on and then say, ""Yes.""You know what? This is somebody who's not going to be a standard politician. This is somebody who's going to take things and sort of twist them in a way they haven't been done before. And when he says, like you said, when he wants to make America great, it's more of a movement than just a slogan. And that's why they're grasping on to him.And yes, some of the things have been offensive. But you know what? It's just like they rub right off and it's a tough well and done and it's working for him.KELLY: Well, let me ask you because we've known each other for a long time. You're a successful .WOHL: Yeah.KELLY: . and talented lawyer. Are you .WOHL: Thank you, Megyn.KELLY: . would you consider yourself a conservative? I mean, is it -- are you one of these conservatives who says, ""I don't care that he may not have been a lifelong conservative."" Or you just somebody who -- I mean, like how would you describe yourself ideologically? So we're not kind of get .WOHL: Ideologically conservative maybe a libertarian, with libertarian bend as well. But Megyn, I -- this is what I think about that. And a lot of people are condemning him and criticizing him because they're saying he's flip-flopped on numerous issues.But where have we heard that before, Ronald Reagan, Barack Obama, Ted Cruz on amnesty. So the idea that Donald Trump cannot evolve politically and everybody else can is not acceptable to me. I mean he is going to evolve.  He lives. He learns. He speaks with people. He is counseled by people.  And that's what gave him the current political bend that he has now.And I got to say, Megyn, I believe him when he says what he wants to do now as far as the Second Amendment, as far as defunding planned parenthood. I believe that when he says that he's going to stick to that. And apparently, a lot of Iowans do as well.KELLY: And we will know, we hope this time tomorrow whether .WOHL: We will.KELLY: . he gets pulls out a victory here in the State of Iowa.Great to see you David.WOHL: Absolutely. Thank you, Megyn.KELLY: Well, just ahead, Hillary Clinton getting called out for her latest attempt to explain away the e-mail questions dogging her campaign.Chief White House Correspond, Ed Henry, is next on that.Plus, one of the nation's top national security lawyers, he will fact check the claims that she's making now that she did nothing wrong here. Don't miss Mark Zaid.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: There is no classified material. So, I'm certainly well aware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, less than 24-hours before Iowans cast the first votes in the nomination of the next president of the United States.  Hillary Clinton is getting called out on her latest attempt to explain away the e-mail scandal that's been hanging over her campaign.Chief White House Correspondent Ed Henry is live in Des Moines, Iowa tonight. Ed?ED HENRY, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Megyn, here in Des Moines tonight, Hillary Clinton is making sort of closing argument and has one of the best crowds of this entire campaign. Over 2,600 people as she tries to push back against Bernie Sanders. They are now locked in a dead heat as her big lead has evaporated in large part because of that e-mail controversy.And, people have eyebrows raised now because of an explanation she gave about why this controversy has dogged her. She gave it on a local TV. station, WHO, just this morning.Look at this, quote, ""The best explanation I heard of this, I heard yesterday in Des Moines from a man I was shaking hands with"". He said quote, ""This is like you drive through the same intersection for four years and the speed limit is 35, then you move out of town and they change the speed limit to 25 and they start sending tickets to people who drove while the speed limit was 35, they drove over 25.'' She said. That was told to her yesterday but we checked the tape, turns out almost three weeks ago, she used the similar anecdote.Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: It would be like somebody in the Department of Transportation setting speed limits, let's say the speed limit was 35. And then retro actively the police say, ""Well you know what, that speed limit should have been 25."" So let's go back and look at anybody who drove down that road and exceeded 25, we need --(END VIDEO CLIP)HENRY: Sounds awfully similar to what she's saying today. She heard just yesterday, gives you an idea of one of the reasons why this whole question of trust, being honest has dogged her throughout the campaign.We'll find it out tomorrow night though, whether it matters in a Democratic caucus. It could be something that's a bigger problem for her in a general election if she gets past Sanders. Megyn?KELLY: Ed, is any other network going to fact check her on that? I mean that is people are laughing. Like everybody in here is like -- it is obvious what happened.HENRY: Right. She is saying it was told to me yesterday the guy was shaking my hand yesterday. Then there's a tape where she said the same thing three weeks ago.KELLY: I mean, it's like, in the first tape did she say somebody told it to her or was she saying it herself? Because maybe she had a conversation with the guy yesterday and said, you know what it is just like he repeated it back to her?HENRY: Maybe the man heard her saying it three weeks ago and repeated it back to her. That might be the best explanation.KELLY: Good to see Ed Henry.Well the e-mail question comes up in almost every major interview for Mrs. Clinton. And this was no exception when she appeared this morning with George Stephanopoulos at ABC News.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS: What do you know about those e-mails that we don't?CLINTON: Well, here's what I know. I know that this is I think continuation of the story that has been playing out for months. There is no classified marked information on those e-mails sent or received by me.STEPHANOPOULOS: But, the nondisclosure agreement you signed as Secretary of State says that that really is not relevant. It said, classified information is marked or unmarked classified, and that all of you are trained to treat all of that sensitively and should know the difference.CLINTON: Well, of course, and that's exactly what I did. I take classified information very seriously. Well, look, as I've said many times it was permitted. My predecessors had engaged in a similar practice. It was not the best choice.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Well we wanted to fact check some of that so we reached out to Mark Zaid. He's a National Security Lawyer who represents Covert Intelligence Officers all of the time. And his firm is handling three lawsuits seeking Mrs. Clinton's e-mail from the state department. Mark great to see you.  So, all right. Let's just -- start with this claim that there were no markings on these documents saying classified so she is exonerated on that basis. Let's play the sound bite. I want to get your reaction. Sound bite number one.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: When you receive information of course there has to be some marking, some indication that someone down the chain had thought that this was classified and that was not the case.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: True or false?MARK ZAID, NATIONAL SECURITY LAWYERS:  False. I mean, any information that is classified is supposed to be properly marked. But oftentimes you could obviously have the information that is not properly marked. In fact, during Secretary Clinton's tenure as secretary, one of its employees Steven Kim was charge under the Espionage Act and prosecuted for verbally disclosing classified information. Obviously that information wasn't marked.KELLY: So, she is not saved once and for all by the fact that the documents may not have had the marking classified on them. That is a red herring.ZAID: No. And, as was said in the ABC interview, Secretary Clinton signs the same secrecy nondisclosure obligations that all of us do. I have a clearance and when we come across classified information even when not marked, we are supposed to report that to the government. I've done it on multiple occasions.KELLY: Now she also claims that you can't get classified information off of the classified system and put it on the non-classified system. Watch, listen here.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: You can't get information off the classified system in the state department to put on to an unclassified system no matter what that system is.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: True or false?ZAID: Well, it's probably true. But that's not what anyone has alleged.  The state department system, I presume, I haven't worked on it specifically, like many of the other agencies, so that there are precautions and limitations on printing information from the classified system. Using e-mail with the classified system. But what is alleged here is that someone took a sentence or so, the brown cow jumped over the moon isn't a classified document. If it you take that sentence and type it in an unclassified e-mail it doesn't mean that sentence is now unclassified.  It just means it is not in the original classified document. That's what is being alleged for the most part as far as we know.KELLY: So, when you hear, you know, I mean, how do you see this situation?  Like, what is your overall take on her maintaining 1,200 documents, they now say, on an unsecured server that were classified?ZAID: And in fact the explanation you heard in the earlier segment with ABC she was talking apples and oranges. There's a difference between classified information and using this private server. That's what some of the predecessors did. Not a private server but at least sending e-mails on a private e-mail account. Nobody was doing hopefully sending classified information on unclassified system.What I have see is -- we don't know from a criminal standpoint. I mean I've seen obviously pundits on the left or the right and everybody saying either, there's no way she'll be prosecuted, she definitely will be prosecuted. The who, what, why, when, I think we're waiting to see. I need to see the context of some of these documents and what information is at issue.But, what I do see from a political standpoint whoever is advising her is giving her poor advice factually speaking. She is making the wrong arguments and it enables those of us who have no -- nothing in this fight.  I don't care who wins. I'm going to be suing whoever is in the White House come next year. So, for her to be able to tee this up.KELLY: Just making it too easy on you.ZAID: Yeah. I mean just stick to. Stick to the real facts.KELLY: Mark I going to cut you off at here. We forgot the hard break.  And thank you for being here.ZAID: Anytime Megyn.KELLY: Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)The candidates are going to want to talk to ""The Kelly File."" See who shows up for special ""Kelly File"" tomorrow night at 11:00 p.m. live from Iowa.  Thanks for watching everybody. I'm Megyn Kelly.
