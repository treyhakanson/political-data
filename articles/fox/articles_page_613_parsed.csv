This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I just believe that this is the most important job in the world. It's the toughest job in the world. You should be willing to campaign for every vote. You should be willing to debate anytime, anywhere.CHUCK TODD, NBC NEWS: Have you thought about accepting that invitation?CLINTON: We'll consider it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You are not ruling it out yet?CLINTON: I haven't thought it it. We'll consider it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Hillary Clinton back in 2008, and this weekend, about our invite to a debate on FOX, likely June 6th, likely in San Francisco, one of three debates that she agreed to with Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders, we told you, had agreed to this debate. We just received word minutes ago from the Clinton campaign that she decided against being a part of this debate. Basically, we are waiting for the official statement from the Clinton campaign, but basically she said she's done nine debates. They are concentrating on California, campaigning there and other states in the final states on June 7th. They don't think a debate would be the best use of resources, and the decision, they say, has nothing to do with FOX.So, with that, let's bring in our panel, Steve Hayes, senior writer for The Weekly Standard, Julie Pace, White House correspondent for the Associated Press, and editor in chief of Lifezette, Laura Ingraham. OK, Steve, obviously people were looking at the politics of this and whether it was good for her to do or not. The basic premise was they agreed to three debates and this was the third. We expect the Sanders campaign to jump on this and put out a statement as well.STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: I would think he will. From her perspective, there's not a lot of reason to do it. There's not much that she can hope to gain. She's basically got the nomination locked up. All she can do is make a mistake. She allows Bernie Sanders to pretend like he is still a contender, even though he's not, if she participates.On the other hand I think you have people in Clinton world who have been making the argument she needs to be less programmed and less calculating. She needs to be herself. Let Hillary be Hillary. And this I think feeds into the perception, an accurate one in my view, that she is overly cautious, overly calculating. Think about what she said in response to Chuck Todd's question there. ""I haven't thought about it."" I mean, really? We have been discussing this nationally in the news media for the past week, the past couple weeks, some people going on further than that. Of course she's thought about that. Why go on national television and say something that is so obviously untrue. And, again, that feeds into the perception she is just cold and calculating and not a very good politician.BAIER: I know her campaign has been thinking about it. We delivered the invitation last Tuesday, and we're waiting for word. We just got it minutes ago. Julie?JULIE PACE, ASSOCIATED PRESS: In general I agree with Steve. I think that she has more to lose in doing this debate than she has to gain. She is obviously at a point where she is fully turning her focus to the general election. She said that she is going to be the nominee with full certainty.The one thing, though, that I would raise as maybe a caution for skipping this debate is we have seen the last couple weeks the struggle that she is going to have in a general election with Donald Trump and his ability to drive the conversation every single day, even in ways that may be negative for him. She's going to struggle to break through. And her campaign is going to have to look for ways to put her out there, to almost force her on the public in a positive set. And I think that this could have been a moment on a large cable network where she would have had a big audience where she could have gotten up there and made a case for the general election even though she had to fend off some criticism from Bernie Sanders.BAIER: Especially, Laura, maybe in California, where she is facing polls that are pretty tight.LAURA INGRAHAM, LIFEZETTE.COM: I mean, this is another disappearing red line for Democrats. We were going to do three debates, now we are not. I think it was the right decision for her. I agree with Steve. But I also think it ends up being great for Bernie's narrative. His whole narrative is the establishment isn't listening to the wishes of the people. The establishment Democrat Party is tone deaf and in fact are disrespecting me and my supporters. He's targeting Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the entire Democratic machine. And now this just confirms the narrative that they don't even want to deal with the unwashed masses who are showing up by the tens of thousands at these Bernie Sanders rallies.I think it cements his pitch to the voters. I think it probably helps him going into that platform crafting at the Democrat convention. I also think for Hillary, I mean, lately at least, the more we see of Hillary, the more people see of Hillary, the less they seem to like her at least as a presidential candidate. So I think for her, it's better to have Obama out there and Bill go out there in these big news nights, have them take some of the fire and let her sit back a little bit.BAIER: Speaking of the former president taking fire from the Donald Trump campaign today in a new ad, and then Hillary Clinton reacted to Donald Trump's campaign.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I was very nervous. No woman should be subjected to it.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I tried to pull away from him.(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: The only thing standing between Donald Trump and the Oval Office is all of us. The last thing we need is a bully in the pulpit. He could bankrupt America like he's bankrupted his companies. I mean, ask yourself, how can anybody lose money running a casino, really?(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Hillary Clinton responding. Meantime, the average of recent polls, according to Real Clear Politics, Steve, has Clinton 43.2 and there you see Donald Trump at 43.4.HAYES: Trump has certainly consolidated the Republican vote faster than I thought he would. I think some of that Republican support remains soft. I think people are supporting him somewhat reluctantly, those Republicans who have sort of come around to Trump.But that message from Hillary Clinton in that speech to me is so off. I mean, she's attacking him for being a bully in the pulpit. But one of the things that was pretty consistent about the exit polls during the primaries is people like that forceful speaking. It may not translate well if he's trying to convert Bernie Sanders voters and Democrat partisans, but even independents who are broadly skeptical of Donald Trump, he still has unfavorable numbers among independents, like Donald Trump because he told it like it is, or made those kind of arguments. We saw that in the polling.BAIER: Julie?PACE: I think she's road testing a couple of messages right now, trying to see what sticks. Obviously in the primaries with the Republicans, nothing really stuck. She's hoping that in a general election audience, one of these things will maybe breakthrough. But she's going to have to settle on something. You can't totally just have a wide open, totally diffused message. You have to settle on something for voters.BAIER: She's still focusing on Bernie Sanders, too.INGRAHAM: He's nipping at the heels. He is pretty good on ""Saturday Night Live"" with Larry Sanders playing him. I take that character over the Hillary character.But I think that Trump ad is worth mentioning. It's eerie. Oh, he can't go down that road. I disagree. I think you have to have a substantive pitch for economic renewal, for sure that has to be the base of his campaign. But the more Hillary tries to rely on the '90s Clinton economy, which is really the Gingrich economy, but the more she tries to rely on him for the domestic agenda, I think more of an opening that gives Trump to say there's more to the '90s than just the balanced budget and job growth. There was a lot more to it, including this narrative which kills your pro- women brand you want to establish.BAIER: The official statement just came through and it just added they are turning their attention to the threat a Donald Trump presidency poses, but roughly the same I told you was in the statement.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

4	4	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/08/22/why-clinton-email-story-wont-go-away/	Why the Clinton email story won't go away	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" August 22, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Secretary Powell has admitted he did exactly the same thing. He had such a distinguished record, you know. I have served my country as well. We both did the same thing. Just recently Colin Powell's e-mails were retroactively classified for more than 10 years ago. And he said that was an absurdity. I could not agree more.DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Look, she is a liar. She lies. She lied about the e-mails, she lied about Colin Powell.REP. JASON CHAFFETZ, R-UTAH: She set up the e-mails on the same day that she started her Senate confirmation hearings. She didn't just go get a Gmail account. She literally set up this own server in the basement of their house.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Well, there you hear some of the explanation of Hillary Clinton talking about former secretary of state Colin Powell and his use of private e-mail. Well, over the weekend surfaced that Powell talked to ""People"" magazine, and here's what he said about all of this, quote, ""Her people have been trying to pin it on me,"" about the e-mail scandal. ""The truth is she was using the private e-mail server for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did. Doesn't bother me, it's OK. I'm free.""We'll start there. Let's bring in our panel: Steve Hayes, senior writer for The Weekly Standard; Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National Public Radio, and editor in chief of Lifezette, Laura Ingraham.OK, Mara, seems like a direct contradiction to what we've heard numerous times from Hillary Clinton and the campaign.MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: She definitely has given the impression that because Colin Powell did it, or she seems to suggest he did something just like what she did therefore it was OK. And now he contradicted that. And this is a story that just won't go away for her. And now the foundation story and the e-mail story are kind of merging as one. So this is continuing. You have the lawsuit by Judicial Watch. You have the investigation by Congress now that they have the FBI notes of the interview with her, and I think it's going to continue.BAIER: You know, people sometimes glaze over will all of this, Steve. But there are two tracts here. There's the e-mail investigation, and now 15,000 additional documents, we don't know how many e-mails, but documents that have not been seen by anybody. Authorities say they just found them. In addition to the 30,000 that were said to be erased.Then you have these emails that Judicial Watch gets, some of them out today, including exchanges between Huma Abedin, a top aide, and Doug Band, the head of the Clinton Foundation in which she says to him, he asked speaking about somebody from Bahrain in town tomorrow. Doug Band asked to see Hillary Clinton, good friend of ours. ""He asked to see Hillary Clinton Thursday, Friday through normal channels. I asked, and she says she doesn't want to commit to anything for Thursday or Friday until she knows how she feels. She says that she may want to go to New York and doesn't want to commit herself to stuff in New York."" Again, this is the Clinton Foundation and the State Department interacting, offering ""Bahrain, 10:00 p.m. tomorrow meeting. If you see him, let him know we've reached out to official channels."" Here is what the State Department said about all of this today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK TONER, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: Important people who had reason to convey information to the secretary, there was nothing that we have seen that implied any kind of untoward relationship.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: And James Rosen finding out that the Clinton Foundation COO, Laura Graham, left at least 148 messages for Cheryl Mills, chief of staff for Hillary Clinton. There is a lot of staff, interaction between top Clinton aides.STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: They probably just wanted to talk about scheduling her yoga sessions and Clinton grandchildren.Look, think about what Hillary Clinton said about this back in July. There is absolutely no connection between anything that I did as secretary of state and the Clinton Foundation. We saw what you just read. Clearly she was lying. People are going to try to dress it up and use all sorts of euphemisms for what she was doing to avoid saying she was lying. Clearly she was lying there.You have now in addition the evidence about Bahrain and the preference they were given in terms of a meeting after going through the Clinton Foundation. We have other e-mails previous disclosed about jobs being offered to Clinton Foundation donors. You have the e-mail about -- the e- mails regarding a person giving a seat on the intelligence advisory committee because of his involvement, or at least related to his involvement in the Clinton Foundation.There is a clear pattern here, and the pattern here is in black and white. What amuses me as I follow other media outlets covering this is they continue to try to cast this as if it's about Republicans. Republicans are attacking Hillary Clinton on the Foundation emails. Republicans say -- this isn't about Republicans. This is about Hillary Clinton having made repeated representations that have turned out to be false, and we're seeing evidence that they were false in black and white.BAIER: Here is what they say, Laura. One, State Department has said there is no direct evidence of a quid pro quo from the Clinton Foundation to anything she did as secretary to that the Clinton Foundation does around the world.LAURA INGRAHAM, LIFEZETTE.COM: We also heard that she turned over all the documents. I don't know what it is about this particular story, the e-mail story, but every time they try to come out to try to clarify, or she is asked a question and she has to answer off the cuff, she always steps in it.Think about Colin Powell. Just go back to that for a moment. He was actually a big ally, a big helper I think to the Clinton campaign. Now who knows what Colin Powell will do in this campaign? Maybe he will just sit it out. If he just sits it out and doesn't say anything, that hurts him. But on this issue with the emails, all the ins and outs, Bahrain or Cheryl Mills, what people I think increasingly are seeing is this was set up for the purposes of helping the Clintons. It was selling access, selling, influence and selling employment positions apparently. That is what it was said for. There were some tangential benefits to some charitable endeavors. But most of it just made the Clintons' lives better. That is why people are sick of politics, because politics you are supposed to servants people, but invariably everybody else exists just to make the Clintons' lives better. That's how I think this is playing out. All the ins and outs get complicated for people. But I think people are seeing this foundation for what it is.BAIER: Meantime, this other story, The New York Post says about Huma Abedin, that Abedin was a, the campaign says, a figurehead, not actually on the staff, but the Saudi based funded Journal of Minority Muslim Affairs which featured radically anti-feminist views and backed strict Islamic laws roundly criticized for oppressing women. A journalism major at George Washington University, Abedin was listed as assistant editor of that journal from 1996 to 2008. Her brother was associate editor, sister employed as an assistant editor, listed as staff members. Abedin's Pakistani mother remains editor-in-chief. Here is what the State Department said about that today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS: When Ms. Abedin was cleared to work here in the Department of State, one of her two jobs she held down during her tenure here, was Ms. Abedin's association with this journal known to the secretary or to anyone else in this building?MARK TONER, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: Having gone through the security clearance processing, considering what -- the level of clearance she would have needed for the job that she held, I can assure you that she was, like any individual would be, fully vetted.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: This journal, Mara, blamed America for 9/11 and had some pretty inflammatory things throughout the years.LIASSON: I think this has the potential to cause even more headaches. I don't know enough about this journal, but it's something I'm sure now everybody is going to be taking a look at it in.BAIER: Well, you would think.LIASSON: These things get attention. The problem is they are often overshadowed by other things.BAIER: The daily Trump story --LIASSON: That's what overshadows.BAIER: Think about this day, think about all the things that came out today, what this would do to the average candidate running.LIASSON: It would be a terrible thing. And she has had one big piece of luck this year in that she has an opponent who has bigger troubles than she does.HAYES: The good news is Hillary Clinton can clear it up what she gives her press conference tomorrow.(LAUGHTER)BAIER: I think it's 260 plus days.INGRAHAM: The other question, the media, they're focusing on it. Why is it that Judicial Watch is doing all the FOIA requests? Thank God for Judicial Watch. What we do without Citizens United, Judicial Watch that are actually doing the work, frankly, that places like ""60 Minutes"" and all these vaunted investigative units.BAIER: Let alone Capitol Hill. Judicial Watch is getting much more than Capitol Hill.INGRAHAM: Again, they're unearthing all of this information. And isn't that what the media generally are supposed to do? They're supposed to be bringing issues to the attention of the American people that go to the basic issues of trust. What is most important, if we can't trust our public officials, then we can't trust that they're going to look out for us first and foremost. And that is what we're seeing in this Clinton Foundation scandal.BAIER: I want to talk about Trump and immigration in just a second, But Mara, politically do you think that this sinks in?LIASSON: Yes, I do. I think this is a problem. Whether it's going to be something that would level the playing field between them, I don't know. But yes, this is a problem. This is why her numbers on honesty and trustworthiness are so bad.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
