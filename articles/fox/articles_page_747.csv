"And now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine...Stunning LossOne political commentator is blaming last week's stunning primary loss -- for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor -- on the fact he is Jewish.New York Times political writer and CNBC Chief Washington Correspondent John Harwood -- made the comment on PBS.Quote -- ""Eric Cantor is a Jewish Republican. This is a very rural conservative southern district where that is not a -- you don't have a lot of Jewish members of Congress from the South.""Host Gwen Ifill countered Harwood's presumption --noting Cantor has been elected several times from the district.Political commentators have come up with a laundry list of possible reasons for Cantor's defeat -- including his moderate stance on immigration -- not spending enough time in his district -- and his focus on national politics.Unfair and UnbalancedThe editor of the Arizona Daily Sun in Flagstaff -- does not have room for balance in his newspaper.Randy Wilson wrote that global warming deniers do not deserve space -- under the headline ""It's Not Censorship by Ignoring Those Denying Climate Change.""Quote -- ""When is a scientific question settled to the point that entertaining further debate becomes not only a waste of precious newsprint but also a diversion from finding a solution to the problems raised by the answer to the question?""Might Have Missed ItAnd finally a story you might have missed if you were sitting in a waiting room in the Veterans Affairs Hospital in Fresno, California.The VA there -- blocked access to Fox News Channel -- claiming the patients were squabbling over the remote.The hospital's PR person says -- it had nothing to do with recent coverage of the VA health care system problems.She said Fox would be unblocked immediately-- and promised to make sure it is available in other waiting rooms.

At least, so far.January's cover of the same magazine is far less flattering.Davis was awarded the Bum Steer of the year Award with the magazine saying it was an easy choice.Quote -- ""Nothing, and we mean nothing, could match the train wreck that was Wendy Davis, battleground Texas, and the Democrats."""
