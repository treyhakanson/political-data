"President George Washington, like many of his successors, loved to kick back with a drink during his time in office, according to a new book on the role of alcohol in politics.Mark Will-Weber, author of ""Mint Juleps with Teddy Roosevelt: The Complete History of Presidential Drinking"" told FoxNews.com America's first president loved his beer. Will-Weber says old letters show Washington loved a particular Philadelphia-based beverage called ""Porter Beer."" A modern-day version is currently brewed by Yards Brewing Company.""He loved it and mixed molasses with it which may explain why Washington's teeth were not that great, but it was just enough sweetness and thickness to add to the authentic porter which they used to get from Britain before the war ... they then learned to brew their own.""Many presidents have a complicated history of alcohol use in office, but Will-Weber said that the inspiration for the book came from President Warren Harding during prohibition.""You weren't supposed to drink or transport alcohol but Harding thought nothing of taking a fifth of whiskey to the golf course, and stashing it into his golf bag and every three holes or so he would take a pop of whiskey - that was the little seed that got me curious about what the rest of the presidents drank.""While the book chronicles many drinking habits of the presidents, Will-Weber explained that several drinks stood out.President William Henry Harrison, the ninth president who held office a short 32 days in 1841 after dying from pneumonia, was a fan of hard cider. In the 1840s, hard cider was the popular drink among the working class--much like beer is today.""The logo of his campaign was a log cabin and hard cider and all his followers would meet to build little log cabins and drink hard cider."" Will-Weber says this helped to portray Harrison as a man of the people against his opponent Martin Van Buren.William McKinley, the 25th president, preferred something stronger.  When he was running for president in 1896, a bartender at that year's Republican convention decided that the then candidate should have his own drink - ""McKinley's Delight.""Will-Weber says the drink ""is nothing to mess around with three ounces of rye whiskey, some sweet vermouth"" along with two dashes of cherry brandy and a dash of absinthe.Recipe: McKinley's DelightPresident Theodore Roosevelt became known for the ""Teddy Hat Cocktail"" during his unsuccessful reelection run in 1912.""His supporters had this cocktail and it came from [when] he used to say 'my hat is in the ring,"" said Will-Weber. The drink is a half jigger of San Juan Rum, a forth jigger of dry gin, and a dash of absinthe. The drink is also topped off with a lemon usually made in the shape of Roosevelt's roughrider hat.Recipe: Teddy Hat CocktailOther fun bits in the book include how President Richard Nixon sipped expensive wine wrapped in a white napkin so no one could see the label, while guests drank the cheaper stuff, and how Franklin D. Roosevelt once hid in a  cloak closet to mix up a cocktail so his mother wouldn't scold him for having more than one. Chris Snyder is a producer for FoxNews.com based in New York.

4	4	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/10/29/glenn-beck-why-america-should-return-common-sense/	Glenn Beck on why America should 'return to common sense'	"This is a rush transcript from ""Hannity,"" October 28, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Joining us now with reaction to this and much more, author of the brand-new book available today, ""Dreamers and Deceivers: True Stories of the Heroes and Villains Who Made America,"" good friend of the program, Glenn Beck. Sir, how are you?GLENN BECK, ""DREAMERS AND DECEIVERS"" AUTHOR: Good, friend Sean. How are you?HANNITY: You know, since you left, if you noticed, the technology has improved. We don't have to use the blackboard like you used to use...BECK: I know. I still use a blackboard. I like the blackboard.HANNITY: Well, listen, that's great. I read some comments -- you and I have had private discussions. We've been on each other's shows a lot.  And I think we're in the same place. I'm really upset with Republicans because I don't think they're putting out a vision that is inspiring to people.BECK: No. The reason why the Republicans are duking it out is because they went and they -- you know, they clipped the wings and knocked the knees out of anybody who actually believed in the Constitution and actually wanted to really go and make some fundamental changes in Washington.And so they're duking it out, you know, progressive versus progressive in some of these states. And it's foolish. They're spending all of this money, where they could have been uniting the country behind some really basic principles that I think most Americans actually agree with.HANNITY: But they will have an opportunity -- if, in fact, the polls are right -- and the polls are up and down and on any given day, you've been seeing states, one candidate is up, the other candidate's up, outside the margin of error. So I can't really tell. I don't have a crystal ball.  But assuming they were to get control of the Senate, I think it would be good for two reasons. First and foremost, it would stop the Barack Obama agenda, I would hope.BECK: What are they going to do on immigration? Because that's going to be the big one.HANNITY: That's huge.BECK: The first thing that's going to happen, Sean, is he's -- I mean, he's printed the green cards. So he's going to -- you know, with the stroke of a pen, he is going to make the illegals legal. So now if they have control of the House and the Senate, what do they do? And what moral authority do they have to be able to actually make any kind of moves?HANNITY: The only constitutional authority that they do have is the power of the purse, which they have been unwilling to use up to this point.BECK: Correct. They haven't used it on really kind of easy things.  They're going to use it on this? And what's that going to do to the country at this point? I mean, if they -- if they actually got into power, I mean, I would -- I would really love to see them start with things that would unite all of us.For instance, on themselves, say, Look, we're here to police ourselves first, because everybody knows Washington is broken. So we're going to start on insider trading. No longer can we have insider trading. No longer can Congress not live by the same exact laws that everybody else does.We're going to make sure that we don't have any special exemptions on ObamaCare. We're going to reduce our salary. We're going to put term limits in for us. If they went and they attacked themselves first, they would actually have the moral authority to be able to...HANNITY: All right, you and I...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: I'll tell you what. When we come back, I want you to lay out your top five, six items. I'll lay out mine, and what I think the vision should be, what I'd like it to be.BECK: OK. Sure.HANNITY: The one and only Glenn Beck will continue right after this break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back. We continue now with the author of the brand-new book available today, ""Dreamers and Deceivers: True Stories of the Heroes and Villains Who Made America,"" Master Glenn Beck, sir.All right, if I had my way, I would want a return to the Constitution, number one. I want to secure our borders. I'd want to stop robbing from our children. I like the penny plan. I'd like choice in health care. I like health care savings accounts. I would certainly like school choice.  That would be a big issue of mine. You know, those are -- and a recognition that radical Islam exists, which we don't have right now, like in the case of Ft. Hood or the case of Oklahoma.What are Glenn Beck's top six items for how to turn the country around?BECK: Return to common sense, return to common sense, return to common sense, return to common sense, return to common sense, return to common sense.HANNITY: Common sense...(CROSSTALK)BECK: You're not going to be able to fix anything until we can at least admit the problems that we have and then fix the easy, low-hanging fruit. And it really is from common sense.So these are the ones, Sean, that I don't think are necessarily the easiest or the hardest or the biggest. These are just the ones that I think are the ones that Americans can pretty much see, Oh, that's common sense, yes, we should do that.For instance, right now, Americans don't feel like they are -- they're not secure. They're not secure in health. They're not secure in their economic prosperity. And they're not secure with terror. So what do you do? Let's start with health, Ebola. It's very clear. You can fly all the planes, all the doctors, all the resources, anybody you want to Africa, but if they're flying out of West Africa, they've got to come through an isolation, and they're in for 21 days. It's really, really simple. That just gives you confidence. Whether it even does anything or not is not as important as restoring confidence and restoring common sense.Two, on terror, you're exactly right. We have to start saying the truth! It is not radicalized Islam. This is psychotic Islam. Anyone who thinks that you can behead people that disagree with you, that's psychotic!  That's got to be called for what it is. And also announce that, yes, it does happen here in America, as well.It is all throughout the planet. We have to recognize it, see what it is, rip it out by its roots. That doesn't mean we hate anybody. That's common sense.The next thing is economic. You know, we have to just at least start admitting that we have a problem. People say that our economy is doing fine. Our economy is not doing fine. And I have verifiable -- anybody who is an economist can tell you this is verifiable. See how they get away with this one. They're telling us now the Fed is printing so much money or digitizing because they're saying, We're worried about deflation.Well, deflation doesn't happen unless you don't have any velocity of money. If you don't have money going out and being spent, it's because people don't feel secure. They don't have the money. They don't have jobs. That's why nobody spends money. So they're worried about deflation.  They're printing money. I keep saying, Hey, inflation, inflation, watch inflation. We're not worried about that. If you're not worried about inflation, that is verification that you know our economy is deathly ill because once you fix the engine, velocity hits in and then you have inflation. They're worried about deflation. You're printing too much money. You're setting us up for a Weimar Republic.So those three things you can easily fix. The economy -- we have to fix the engine of the economy. We have to stop the Fed from digitizing any more money. Enough is enough. Stop spending it.On health care, let's just start with Ebola! Stop the flights out of Africa without isolation. And the last one is stop with the political correctness. Let's stop saying that this is a gun and somebody chopping off your head is workplace violence. That doesn't make any sense.HANNITY: Let me ask you the reality here because in principle, I agree with everything that you said. I'd say it a little differently. The penny plan, take a penny out of every dollar...BECK: An insane person usually would.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: We're breaking open our kids' piggy banks. Secure the border -- that -- for Ebola and for ISIS, national security, recognizing radical Islam, school choice, health care that people can buy across state lines, pre-existing conditions...BECK: Yes.HANNITY: ... free market capitalism...BECK: Those are -- you know...HANNITY: But do -- my fear is, is I don't hear very many. There are a few Ted Cruzes out there, Rand Pauls and Marco Rubios and some good governors. There's not enough of them. I don't know if the Republicans have the vision. So my last question...BECK: They don't.HANNITY: Do you have faith and confidence if they get the House and Senate that they'll do a lot of these things?BECK: Let me answer this way. When George Bush -- I saw George Bush -- Barack Obama was still running, and he was running against Hillary. And at the time, Hillary was winning. And he -- this was the day that Hillary -- that Barack Obama said, I'll just fly the planes over the border into Syria, and I'll just bomb -- not Syria -- Pakistan. I'll just bomb Pakistan.and that was insane at the time. That was a day that I happened to be meeting the president in the Oval Office. And I said, Mr. President, what do you think of that? And he said, trying to comfort me, Glenn, don't worry. Whoever sits behind this desk in this office will find that their hands are tied. They'll get the same advice that I've been getting.  Believe me, they'll do almost exactly the same thing that I have done.I fear -- he tried to make me feel better on that. That did not make me feel better. And it's come true. I fear that no matter who gets into office, unless they truly have a spine and they listen to the American people and to common sense, they're going to do exactly the same thing.HANNITY: Glenn, half...BECK: Just at slower speed.HANNITY: ... half the population wants bigger government. We believe in limited government. We believe in greater responsibility. Half the country, according to the latest Gallup poll, they want more stuff from the government!BECK: Listen to the American people. They don't -- look, Sean, we can argue about policies all day long...HANNITY: Yes.BECK: ... but common sense -- if we don't go back and change the culture and change people's heart and start speaking the truth kindly to one another, gently, without politics, we're not going to make it.HANNITY: All right...BECK: It's not too late, though. We will make it. We just have to be -- our best -- our best selves.HANNITY: On that very positive note, Glenn, thanks for staying up late. Good to see you.BECK: Thank you.

6	6	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2004/10/13/michael-reagan-politics-his-father-and-his-new-book	Michael Reagan on Politics, His Father and His New Book	"This is a partial transcript from ""The O'REILLY Factor,"" Oct. 12, 2004, that has been edited for clarity.Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET and listen to the ""Radio Factor!""BILL O'REILLY, HOST:   In the ""Personal Story"" segment tonight, as you may or may not know,  Michael Reagan was adopted by Ronald Reagan and his first wife, actress  Jane Wyman.  The couple subsequently divorced, and Michael stayed with his  mother.Mr. Reagan grew up to become a powerful radio voice in America as well  as a best-selling author with strong opinions on the state of the union.   His new book is called ""Twice Adopted.""And Michael Reagan joins us now from Los Angeles.MICHAEL REAGAN, AUTHOR, ""TWICE ADOPTED"":  Good to see you, Bill.O'REILLY:  Let's talk a little politics first.  You just heard Lanny  Davis say -- and I believe it's true -- that Americans are conflicted,  divided over Iraq, and nobody can definitively say who has the better plan,  Bush or Kerry, because it's a hope on both parts.  How do you see it?REAGAN:  Well, it's interesting.  Everybody wants to see a plan.  It's  like the president of the United States should write down a plan, show  America, get the approval of America and go forward.I mean, these are the things that Colin Powell works on, Donald  Rumsfeld works on, the president works on.  You certainly don't want to  tell the terrorists what you're about ready to do, and John Kerry knows  this, and John Edwards knows this also, and I don't think John Kerry and  John Edwards have put together any plan at all except to bring in more  people.There's 30 nations helping the president right now.  We've got to win  this war.  This is what he wants to do, and he knows that it's going to  take America to lead the charge.  It always takes America to lead the  charge, Bill.O'REILLY:  Well, why...REAGAN:  It would be nice to have somebody else step up, but they  don't.O'REILLY:  They don't.  I -- listen, we all know what geopolitical  reality is, and that's why I think the senator, if he keeps pounding the  ally thing, is going to hurt himself.But why should you, Michael Reagan, have any confidence that President  Bush will win the war in Iraq or at least turn that country into a decent  nation with the WMD fiasco, with the aftermath fiasco?You know, a lot of independent voters are saying why should I have  confidence in an administration that's obviously run into difficulties  here?REAGAN:  Well, I think they say they've run into difficulties because  that's what the news has really covered.  They cover the death that's going  on in Iraq, the American military personnel that are dying.But here in Los Angeles, you know, when they turn on the news at  night, I hear about drive-by shootings.  Do I leave L.A.?  Do I think L.A.s  gone to hell and I should never live here again?  No.  There's a lot of  great things going on, too, that are not covered.I have trust in this president to follow through in his promise to  those that died on September 11, that we're going to get the people  responsible for this, we're going to get Osama bin Laden, but we don't want  to have another North Korea sitting in the middle of Baghdad with a Saddam  Hussein.  You didn't want him to have weapons of mass destruction.No, they didn't find weapons of mass destruction, but Saddam Hussein  fooled the world.  He didn't just fool maybe our CIA.  He fooled John  Kerry...O'REILLY:  He fooled everybody.REAGAN:  ... John Edwards, everybody.  So we're blaming the president  of the United States that -- somehow that he was...O'REILLY:  I'm not.  I'm a forward-looking guy.  I mean, I...REAGAN:  Absolutely right.O'REILLY:  I've come to the conclusion the WMDs thing was an honest  mistake throughout the world, not just us, but I'm looking forward and I  want -- I don't want Americans dying over there in Iraq.  I don't want it,  you know.REAGAN:  No.  Nobody wants -- but nobody wants Americans to die in  war, but we do die in war.  That's what war is about.O'REILLY:  Right, but this isn't...REAGAN:  We do die.O'REILLY:  This is an optional war.  Now I believe you have to win it.   Now you're in it, you win it, you know, but it's an option.  It's not like  Los Angeles where you're living there and that's your home.  This is  halfway around the world.So what I'm saying to people is, look, you've got to make a decision.   It's a hard decision to make because we don't know because we're voting on  hope.All right.  So your brother is on MSNBC.  He's got the black  turtleneck.  He's got the little dickey on, and he's out there trashing --  I mean trashing -- Bush.  It's not moderate.  It's full-brunt assault,  almost Michael Moore-esque.  How do you react to that?REAGAN:  You try not to talk about those kinds of issues.  I mean, we  have agreed to disagree on the issue.  I know Ron is one of those people  who hates George Bush, like Michael Moore hates George Bush, like many  other people who are voting this year hate George Bush.  They still look at  the 2000 election...O'REILLY:  Do you know why he hates George Bush?REAGAN:  He is -- he was born -- I -- he is liberal.  He thinks George  Bush stole the election back in the year 2000, as Jesse Jackson just over  the weekend down there in Florida was saying the same thing.Many of the liberals feel the very same, that George Bush is not the  president, Al Gore won the presidency.  How dare he steal the presidency  from our president?I mean, I believe Ron the last election voted for Nader and would  probably vote for him again.  You don't hear him say that he's for Kerry.O'REILLY:  He just hates Bush.REAGAN:  He's so against George Bush, yes.O'REILLY:  But it's interesting because Bush carries on a Reagan-esque  philosophy, get the evildoers, impose democracy, just as Ronald Reagan did.   They did it in different ways, different styles, but the basic steely  determination that democracy is the savior of the world, evildoers have got  to be hunted down are common between the two men.REAGAN:  But, Bill...O'REILLY:  See, that's what I don't understand, the vitriol coming  out.  I guess Ron Reagan admired his father, didn't he?REAGAN:  Yes.  I mean, we all admired our dad, but he disagreed with  him vehemently on politics.O'REILLY:  He did?REAGAN:  So -- oh, yes, absolutely.O'REILLY:  So Ron Reagan disagreed with his father from what?  Teenage  years?  Or when did that...REAGAN:  Teenage years.  He just -- you know, we used to say he's a  product of the '60s.  And I've said this before.  I mean, USS Ronald Reagan  -- we just home ported her in San Diego, but Ron wouldn't be there, Patty  wouldn't be there because they are not pro military.  They're not for, you  know, peace through strength like their father was.O'REILLY:  That's really fascinating.  That's really interesting.  I  mean, I just find it so fascinating in a home where you had such a strong  definition through the father that the two siblings would just reject it  entirely.All right.  Let's...REAGAN:  Well, that's why Maureen and I were here, so we could cancel  their votes on any given November day.O'REILLY:  No, I know, but that even makes it more -- your late sister  and yourself make it more fascinating to see the family dynamic, you know.REAGAN:  You didn't want to be at Christmas dinner, Bill.(LAUGHTER)REAGAN:  You didn't want to be at Christmas dinner.O'REILLY:  I would have had gravy all over me, Michael.REAGAN:  Oh, yes.  It's just one thing you never wanted to do.O'REILLY:  Both sides would have not liked me.  I would have been  flying.REAGAN:  That's right.O'REILLY:  All right.  Now, look, ""Twice Adopted"" is an important  book.  It's a very personal book.  But, you know, there are a lot of books  out there, and people -- 25 bucks is no easy deal.  Why should people buy  this book?REAGAN:  You know, because with this book, for whatever reason, I'm  just able to write the book through the eyes of a child.  So many things go  on in the world today.  You talk about it on your radio show.  You talk  about it on your television show.What do you talk about?  You talk about child pornography.  Have you  ever talked to somebody who was the photo of child pornography, of what  it's like to be the photo and what that does to somebody's life, because  you'll learn what it does to somebody's life.You'll learn that when I had to develop the photo that a predator took  of me when I was 8 years old, had me develop it, put his hand on my  shoulder, and said wouldn't your mother like to have a copy of this, you  will find out it took me six years to get out of my mother's house to  protect her from me because I thought then I was truly the predator.Or how I hated the fact that my father was running for governor or  president because I so worried that those photos would come out and people  would know the truth about me, how hateful I was and the kind of person  that I was.  You're going to hear for the very first time what it's like to  be the photo in child pornography.I was also molested, and I was able to look through the eyes again of  a child, what up -- what a child sees.  We're always asked, bill, why  didn't you tell somebody?  You're going to find out why we don't tell  anybody.And, hopefully, this is going to be a help to parents who are dealing  with children who hate themselves, who don't understand why maybe their  mother gave them away when they were adopted.  You're going to find out  what a child feels like.Or my definition of divorce, Bill, where I say it's where two people  walk into a child's room, take everything that's dear and near to that  child, break it into a million pieces, walk out and expect the child to put  it back together.O'REILLY:  Well, I...REAGAN:  That's the kind of stuff they're going to find out.O'REILLY:  OK.  I think you just sold your book, and it's certainly a  cautionary tale that Americans should know about.Michael, always a pleasure to see you.  Thank you very much for coming  on.REAGAN:  Thank you, Bill.O'REILLY:  OK.Content and Programming Copyright 2004 Fox News Network, L.L.C. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
