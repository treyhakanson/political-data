This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So I apologize to Ben for that. They should have forwarded that subsequent story. That was a mistake on our part.DONALD TRUMP, R, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It is a total voter fraud when you think about it. And he picked up a lot of the votes, and that's why the polls were so wrong. A lot of people didn't think I should go to Iowa and I came in -- actually, I came in probably first if you think about it.CRUZ: Well, it is no surprise that Donald is throwing yet another temper tantrum, or if you like, another Trumper-tantrum. It seems his reaction to everything is to throw a fit, to engage in insults. And I understand that Donald finds it very hard to lose.BEN CARSON, R, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We can say whether or not we take something like this and just sweep it under the rug, and say that's just the way it is. Or are there consequences?(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, HOST: Donald Trump says there should be another vote in Iowa. It is just not fair. Ted Cruz says this is a Trumper-tantrum. Ben Carson says he should have done better but for dirty tricks being played by the Cruz people and perhaps others.Meantime all the focus is on the Granite State now, and take a look at where all these candidates have been. The campaign stops in New Hampshire, look at that. John Kasich, the Ohio governor with 180, neck in neck with Chris Christie. These are stops in New Hampshire.Here's the Real Clear Politics Average of polls heading into New Hampshire. It doesn't really translate the number of stops with the percentages there, at least as of yet. But who knows what can change in the next six days?Let's bring in our panel, Jonah Goldberg, senior editor of ""National Review,"" Amy Walter, national for ""The Cook POLITICAL Report,"" and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. OK, Jonah, what about this back and forth about Iowa dominated today?JONAH GOLDBERG, SENIOR EDITOR, ""NATIONAL REVIEW"": It was funny because Donald Trump for the first, what, 36 hours -- I think there was a clock on it -- behaved graciously and maturely. And then he seemed like he couldn't contain himself anymore.The problem for him in part was that by behaving conventionally, he seemed like a conventional politician. And that's a bad place for Donald Trump to be, because whenever he is not dominating the media cycle he goes down in the polls. So I think that's probably what he's up to here is he wants to throw a Trumper-tantrum, not the most euphonious phrase I've ever heard, in order to be back in the limelight. I'm not sure it is going to work the way he wants to. On the other hand, I think Ben Carson has a legitimate complaint.BAIER: Amy?AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, ""COOK POLITICAL REPORT"": Every time I leave New Hampshire, I say this whole caucusing is a hot mess. How is it that we cover this every four years? The way that they put this together every four years something goes wrong. And we call the whole thing into question. And then four years later we come back and we say isn't this quaint and cute?The fact of the matter is it is a process that is rife with the potential for fraud. You have a blank piece of paper. You write a name on it. You stick it in the ballot. On the Democratic side, you hang out with a bunch of people, raise your hands, and then you flip coins.GOLDBERG: Those coins are rigged.WALTER: That's the process. And we've accepted that, and this is the first state, and now we move on. The certain other people not accepting this, to me, I don't know this is helpful at all for him as a way to get into the media. This makes him look, I think, much more about being petty and self-centered rather than being about strong and defiant.BAIER: Charles, you know, he does say he didn't spend much money. He came in second, although he now says he actually probably came in first. And he says now he lives another day in New Hampshire.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: The reason he can't admit to coming in second is because if he loses anything, the earth wobbles off its axis. There's sort of a force is injured if that happens, so he can't accept it.I disagree slightly with Jonah. I don't think that the reason he insists right now with the tweeting and the attacks on the attention coming back to him for electoral strategic reasons. I think it is just a psychological need, speaking as a layman there.But the one thing I will say as to the effect, I think this has a weird effect of helping Rubio. This is the scenario where the two top dogs, the two coming out of Iowa, the two dominate the national polls attack each other. They each are somewhat diminished by it. And then Rubio just kind sneaks in there. It has happened in Iowa in 2004 with the Democrats. In some way you could say it happened in Iowa this time around with Rubio unexpectedly rising. So I think he gets the benefit. It is probably a minor one. But this doesn't help Trump either way.BAIER: Rand Paul is out of this race, now, Jonah, saying that he was proud of the way he ran. It opens up the libertarian part of the party. Why didn't he do well? He was on the front page of ""TIME."" Everybody thought going in that he was going to catch fire. ISIS was really the reason, wasn't it?GOLDBERG: I think that's a big part of it. I think the rumors of the libertarian moment on the right were always greatly exaggerated. There are some issues that are libertarian friendly, but the idea that somehow because the country is moving towards gay marriage that it's also going to be in favor of reducing the size and scope of government or not bombing ISIS, a lot of these libertarian issues that libertarian activists like to lump together as one coherent whole actually aren't coherent in people's minds, and a lot of these things move separately.And I think one of the people who believed the libertarian moment stuff was Rand Paul. And I think ISIS in particular brought out the Jacksonian desire in America to kick butt and take names.BAIER: We should point out that while Ted Cruz shares some of these beliefs he's is now talking about it a lot more on the stump today in New Hampshire about the NSA, about Second Amendment, and obviously the campaign feels there's some opening there.WALTER: It has been woven into the fabric of the debate as opposed to into the entire contingent of candidates rather than being its own separate lane that it once was with Ron Paul. So whether it's discussion about the FED, whether it's discussion about the NSA surveillance, the base about the role of American foreign policy, that has all been encompassed within this debate. He doesn't own it.The other thing that I never understood about the Rand Paul focus was that he was talking so much about what he needed to do as a general election candidate. Here's who we need to talk to. We need to expand the base. It was fine for a general election. It was never going to appeal in a primary electorate.BAIER: Charles, you mentioned it, but you have Chris Christie who is really swinging hard against Senator Rubio. You obviously have Governor Kasich, Governor Bush, Carly Fiorina. They are all fighting for that spot with Senator Rubio kind of coming off on the establishment side.KRAUTHAMMER: Yes, it's the three governors and Carly. And I think all of them understand that unless they end ahead of Rubio, they have to leave the race. Their donors, their supporters will all insist on that. So they're going after Rubio, not necessarily Trump or even Cruz, because their contest is an internal one.But one thing on Cruz and the libertarians, he had his eye on that constituency years ago. Remember when Rand Paul stood up and had his filibuster, ends up on the cover of ""TIME"" magazine. Cruz then supported Rand Paul and had his own little filibuster. He had good shoes, apparently, lasted a long time. So he went after evangelicals, and you see who dropped out today, Huckabee and Santorum, the evangelical champions. And he went after the so-called liberty vote. And you saw today, Rand Paul. He's been succeeding in inheriting their constituents.BAIER: By the way, Santorum is dropping out, we're told, and going to endorse. He is on Greta Van Susteren in the next hour.GOLDBERG: I think it's worth pointing out, though, that Cruz has also been a little slippery about his foreign policy. He said that his foreign policy position falls somewhere between Rand Paul and John McCain, which is like saying the football is somewhere between the goalposts.(LAUGHTER)BAIER: All right, it is time to check out this week's results from the new SPECIAL REPORT Contenders app. We have added up the results from the FOX News app. The statement about the middle class that was most agreed with was ""In 1961 John F. Kennedy reduced tax across the board. The economy grew. In 1981 Ronald Reagan reduced taxes across the board and the economy grew. This has to be the mission we have to do.""That statement belongs to former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore, who is still in this race. He is creeping up the board as other drop outs. Here's how all the candidates did. The scale is one to 100, with one meaning complete disagreement and 100 total agreement with these quotes. Users also ranked the middle class topic as a fairly important issue, ranking it on average three and three-quarters out of five stars. Panelists, a couple of you took the quiz. Jonah, who did you end up with?GOLDBERG: I was with Ben Carson.BAIER: Ben Carson on his statement. And Charles?KRAUTHAMMER: I was with Fiorina. And my second was Christie.Could I just say that Gilmore creeping up reminds me of the newly discovered tortoise on St. Helena who is 180 years old? There is hope. I think he's related. Sorry.(LAUGHTER)BAIER: We'll leave it there.WALTER: I didn't think we could get those things together.BAIER: Next week's contenders issue is gun control so logon to the FOX News app and see who you agree with. Next up, the Democrats and who really won Iowa.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: One contest down. Only nine more months to go until America elects our next president.I'm Eric Bolling along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Dana Perino, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is ""The Five.""Hello, everyone. We are back from Iowa where the first vote of 2016 presidential race is in the history books. And what a wild night it was. Today, the candidates are fanned out across New Hampshire. The next front in the war for the White House. More on that battle in just a minute.The contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders was settled just today. Even though Clinton declared victory last night. The AP is called it in her favor. The closest race in Iowa caucus history.Last night, Iowans set a new record for turnout in the republican race. Ted Cruz got the nod there surprising many pollsters who had Donald Trump pegged to win.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: God bless the great State of Iowa.(APPLAUSE)Tonight, Iowa has proclaimed to the world, morning is coming. And tonight is a testament to the people's commitments, to their yearnings to get back to our core commitments, free market principles, constitutional liberty and the Judeo-Christian values that built this great nation.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: And Trump placed second and Marco Rubio pulled off a strong finish in third adding fuel to his bid for the White House.All right. So, we'll bring it around. We'll talk about the GOP first. We'll get to the democrats in a minute. Sum up for us, KG, what is your -- what is your take away.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: I'm in a -- well, it was very exciting. Iowa is fantastic. Lots of enthusiasm. I love a big turnout. Let's talk about that for sure. And on both sides in Hillary, wow. She's like WD-40'd so squeeze that little win right out. Didn't you?So, she's in trouble. I am thinking New Hampshire and going forward we'll see what happened. As for Ted Cruz, I'm in a 12-step recovery program from the longest speech ever. And you know, as you know, we were waiting to take off till that. So, thanks for that.And look, he pulled off the big victory, no doubt. He had a great ground game. So, he delivered what he promised. Marco Rubio I think was the big surprise. The big win, though, of the night, really outperforming, which I thought was fantastic.He did what we talked about earlier in he program yesterday. You know, under promise, over deliver. So, that was a nice skill set that he displayed there. He has a lot of enthusiasm and momentum going into New Hampshire.As for Donald Trump who is a very close race. He obviously outperformed what many of the critics thought he would be able to do and accomplish in Iowa. He is still in a strong position for New Hampshire.And what I liked the most was how he handled the, you know, the second place finish. I thought he was gracious, his rhetoric, his language being, you know, very congratulatory to the other people running and he set a nice tone. Short and sweet.BOLLING: So, it was a huge turnout, Dana. Now 186,000 or so caucus goers turned out this time. A 150 percent higher broke the record by 50 percent. Interesting, the top three finishers, Trump, Cruz, -- I'm sorry, Cruz, Trump, Rubio, all three would have had the highest vote totals in history.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Right.BOLLING: And only a few thousands separate them.PERINO: And just to add to that, Ted Cruz ended up with more votes than any GOP winner in Iowa ever. So, he is that...(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Yes. But so did Trump and so did...PERINO: They did.BOLLING: Rubio.PERINO: Well, that is just amazing.GUILFOYLE: They know a very good in that.PERINO: That's huge. But I do think obviously Ted Cruz deserve a lot of credit for knowing that state well, he had really good organization. And he had a few things that could have tripped him up but they didn't. Are we going to do our -- do you want to do our sound bite now?BOLLING: No, no. Don't say that.PERINO: OK. Then I'll wait.BOLLING: OK. Greg, your thoughts on the GOP.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: I think Rubio gained the most. It raises the question, is America ready for a president who looks like a teenage member of Menudo?GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: He's like a straight Ricky Martin. And then if you look at the other side, you look at how close Sanders got to Hillary. I mean, who knew that there were that many socialists in Iowa. It's like finding Satanists in the Vatican or brain cells in Paris Hilton.I mean, that she is the most famous woman on earth and she is being beaten by an obscure socialist. She's as popular as Shingles.BOLLING: OK. One quick thought on the GOP before we get to your side.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, I just think that it was big night for Marco Rubio. He's going to beat expectations. And it is interesting because it's like two-thirds of the voters in Iowa went for as clearly anti-establishment republican, Cruz and Trump.But then all of a sudden, last minute when it was a matter of who can win in the general election. Who can beat Hillary Clinton? I think that boosted Rubio for people who are late to side her. And I think that's what was at work there.But I got to always, I mean, let's just, you know, I don't play games here, Cruz is the Trump buster, right? I mean, he is the guy that beat all expectations. All the polls were wrong. Juan Williams was wrong. Everybody was wrong.Everybody was wrong who thought, hey, there is not a poll that doesn't show Trump winning. Guess what? Cruz by targeting, micro targeting people, even sending out false notices saying Carson is out of the way.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: That's terrible.WILLIAMS: Whatever he did, it worked. He won.BOLLING: But again, all three of those guys would have broken the record for caucus winners.GUILFOYLE: Which is exciting. It shows momentum.BOLLING: Winner, yes. We'll run very quickly. Marco Rubio feels like the big winner from the night. Because now you have the four quote, unquote ""establishment"" candidates Rubio, Cruz, Christie, and Bush.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: You can take Bush.BOLLING: Or five, whatever. Now they all coalesce behind one guy. But look how this sets up. Now you have to outsiders vying for one vote and maybe the establishment goes behind Rubio. The script has been flipped on the outsiders versus the state sides.WILLIAMS: Oh, no. Look, you coming out of New Hampshire. Those inside...(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: For one week. For one week.WILLIAMS: What do you mean?BOLLING: I mean, out of Iowa, only out of Iowa.WILLIAMS: Oh, OK. Because I think in New Hampshire you're going to have all the establishment candidates who did not do well in Iowa with the exception of Rubio even if you consider him. Remember, he was a Tea Party guy at one point.But if you consider him now acceptable for the establishment as compared to Cruz or Trump. Then you have in New Hampshire, Bush, Kasich, Christie and Rubio...BOLLING: Fighting it out.WILLIAMS: ... basically they say that's trouble.BOLLING: All right. Dana, let's talk about your takeaway from last night.PERINO: So, that's when we get to planning?BOLLING: That's it, yes.PERINO: OK. So, we were asked to think about it what you took away from that. One, I thought that turnout was higher for both. But it actually didn't end up helping who...BOLLING: Yes.PERINO: ... Evangelist thought it would help. So, the higher turnout they expected would help Bernie Sanders and Trump and that actually didn't -- wasn't the case. There was the higher turnout. But I think that shows that Cruz and Rubio and then Hillary Clinton had really good organization on the ground. So, there's that.What I thought was interesting to me, is how do you nail your dismount, right? So, you stick the landing so that you can propel and jump right then into New Hampshire. Because you want a really good speech. And I felt like the two winners, Cruz and Hillary, did not have very good speeches. But that Trump and Rubio did themselves a favor, so I think we have both of those.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)CRUZ: Iowa has sent notice that the republican nominee and the next President of the United States will not be chosen by the media. Will not be chosen by the Washington establishment.(APPLAUSE)Will not be chosen by the lobbyists.HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We have to be united against a republican vision and candidates who would drive us apart and divide us. That is not who we are, my friends. I followed their campaign very closely. I understand what they're appealing to. And I intend to stand against it.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Yes. Now I should say, I think that Cruz had an amazing historical night. So, he was -- I think that the big knock against him was his speech was really long. But, whatever.I just don't think that -- I think that he could have had a better head into New Hampshire. Now if you come in second and third, I think that Trump and Rubio did a better job with their bids to go on to the next state. I think we have that too.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm really honored and I want to congratulate Ted and I want to congratulate all of the incredible candidates, including Mike Huckabee who has become a really good friend of mine.I want to thank all of the folks that worked with us. We had a great team. We're so happy with the way everything worked out.SEN. MARCO RUBIO, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Tonight, I thank you in Iowa. I thank you because tonight we have taken the first step. But an important step toward winning this election.Now the moment has arrived for this generation of Americans to rise up to the calling of our heritage. Now the time has come for to us take our place and do what we must. And when I'm elected president of these great United States, we will do our part.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: So, I felt like Trump was very gracious there and he didn't -- I didn't -- he didn't try to do something that would steal the spotlight away. Plus, besides, if you win the nomination, you got to go back to Iowa and try on win it because it will be an important state.And then I think that Rubio, I talked to somebody who advises their campaign and he said I think that Rubio even surprised himself last night which is why I think it sounded humble and gracious.BOLLING: Yes, I agree with both assessments. I think Trump was very good. He was humble and gracious and congratulated the winner and said, look, I'm coming back. I'm not done here.PERINO: I'm going to buy a farm.BOLLING: And Marco he was bid, he felt really good about it. All right. I'm going to tell you my takeaway tonight.The coin toss. Are you kidding me? The democrats have decided who won the Iowa caucus over a coin toss. That means the leader of the free world on the democrat side, in their opinion, can be done by tossing a coin. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tails.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Tail.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do you get?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You got the extra delegate.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I thought it was point left.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Point left?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. So, our official delegate for this precinct is Hillary Clinton.(APPLAUSE)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was very, very close, people. Remember, this is the caucus. It was very, very close. It was called by a coin toss.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: So, Hillary wins by five precincts. She had six coin tosses which she won all six of.PERINO: Oh, my God.BOLLING: And the odds of that are 1 in 64. Because poor Bernie bought the old heads I win, tail you lose gag, I guess. But think about this for one second. If she's president, and they say, madam president, do we go to war? I don't know, toss a coin. Do we raise taxes? I don't know, heads. Should we open our borders? I'll go with heads again. Apparently, showing heads with all.GUILFOYLE: I think that should only be for who is kicking and who is receiving, if you got what I mean as the commander-in-chief.BOLLING: Yes, I got where you're going with that one.GUILFOYLE: Yes.BOLLING: All right. You want to tell us about yours?GUILFOYLE: Yes. Because you just can't get enough HRC, right? So, here's the thing. When a coin toss she thinks that those weighted coins come in handy? Did you get them, distribute them? So, what happen was she decides that, OK. They say she is going to win or she's the winner of it. But she actually doesn't say that she won.And in fact, Bill Clinton and Chelsea were supposed to speak. That was called off last second she got off, and was just like, whoa, weight off the shoulders. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: As I stand here tonight, breathing a big sigh of relief, thank you, Iowa!(APPLAUSE)I will keep doing what I have done my entire life. I will keep standing up for you. I will keep fighting for you. Join me. Let's go win the nomination. Thank you all and God bless you!(APPLAUSE)GUILFOYLE: You just can't feel so good about that. I mean, coin toss, it was so close. And, you know, how did Bernie Sanders pull it off? I believe it was Greg's t-shirt.GUTFELD: Well, you bring it to the one in Greg's in a minute but won a coin toss? I mean, is this really the best way to pick your nominee?WILLIAMS: I think the best way is to caucus and to have whatever the rules are, the rules are. But what's interesting to me is that, it was a dead heat.Again, to pick, go back to what Dana was saying, huge turnout both sides, right? And that was supposed to benefit Trump and Bernie Sanders. You get the big turnout. You got the very lefty democratic base in the State of Iowa. And it is still a tie.I think that's a surprise. And so, the thing is going into New Hampshire, I think Bernie has a 25-point advantage right now in the polls New Hampshire. He is from the neighboring state. He is likely to win.But what does it mean going forward? And I don't think that it is a very good news. Because he has to now build a structure in place just like South Carolina, Nevada, and elsewhere. He just didn't have that. Hillary is already there.BOLLING: Quick thought before we go?GUTFELD: Sure. I thought I'd left the building. The fact that Sanders got this close tells you two things. That Hillary Clinton is a bad candidate. Hillary Clinton is a bad candidate. And it's amazing. She's so bad.GUILFOYLE: Heads or tails.GUTFELD: She's so bad. That even being a historical first is not going to help her. The fact that she is running as a woman is not going to help her. And the fact that a socialist -- the fact that you can only vote for a socialist if you've never experienced socialist or socialism.It's like liver and onions. Once you've tried it, you never have it again. That's why it's no on dinner menu. Socialism is the liver and onions of ideology and it's amazing that that actually came close to beating, again, probably one of the most famous women on the planet but nobody -- nobody can stand her. She's this popular.PERINO: And if Sanders had just done a little bit to attack her or just question her trustworthiness on the e-mails, he probably would have won.GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: Can I throw one more stat in there?PERINO: Go ahead.BOLLING: There is never been, in less 40 years, there is never been a president who has lost both Iowa and New Hampshire. So, you have to win one of the two to become President of the United States. At least over the last 40 years.GUILFOYLE: We'll see what happens there.BOLLING: Any prediction on the top three in New Hampshire? I know we're doing New Hampshire...(CROSSTALK)PERINO: We're doing New Hampshire in C block.BOLLING: Do you want to try it? No?GUTFELD: NO, I'll wait.BOLLING: Anybody?GUILFOYLE: I don't know.BOLLING: Oh, my God. Wow. Such a huge energy. All right. Last night's vote tweeted to us. Our Twitter handle is @thefive, use the hash tag The Five. We're going to answer some of your questions ahead. More of our takeaways from last night who won some grace when The Five returns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Welcome back to The Five's Iowa caucus breakdown and our takeaways from the night. Juan, what do you have?WILLIAMS: Well, you know, Greg was so disdainful of liver. And I happen to like liver and onions.GUILFOYLE: And gizzards.WILLIAMS: Yes.GUTFELD: I'm very mean to my liver.WILLIAMS: Well, but I have for you, Greg. We're going to serve up for you, baked cauliflower. Please, roll the tape of Bernie Sanders.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SANDERS: What Iowa has begun tonight is a political revolution.(APPLAUSE)When young people and working people and seniors begin to stand up and say loudly and clearly, enough is enough.(APPLAUSE)That our government, the government of our great country belongs to all of us. And not just a handful of billionaires. When that happens, we will transform this country.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: I think he's talking to you, Gregory. He's talking about free health care, single payer health care, free education...(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: ... higher education, raising the minimum wage, higher taxes on Eric. This is what we're talking about.GUTFELD: Yes. A failed ideology that destroyed countries. By the way, he reminds me of somebody at the rental car agency who is mad that he didn't get the Sebring. And he wanted the Cadillac because they were going down Highway 1. But they didn't have. They had a hard top and he is demanding a refund.WILLIAMS: Well, but you know what, look. I think Bernie did OK.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: He's a nice guy. But he is preaching a deadly ideology.WILLIAMS: No, I mean, if Bernie...(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: He did great.GUILFOYLE: Yes, what are you talking about?WILLIAMS: Again, look, I'm telling something. Bernie had a chance there...BOLLING: A socialist is now tied with Hillary Clinton.WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: He did fantastic.GUTFELD: Wait. A socialist is tied with a socialist.WILLIAMS: Correct. You guys can't even, you can't even recognize, wait a second. That electorate as we keep repeating is very -- I mean, I think it's 43 percent of them say they are socialist.GUTFELD: Yes. You know what, it's because the media, the academia and the government has created an incredible snow job for the last four decades painting socialism as some kind of romantic notion instead of something that actually kills.WILLIAMS: Oh, look. You know what I think? They're mad, their populist energy mad at republicans. I think they think that this is the democratic response, the far right of the Republican Party.GUTFELD: I won't disappoint -- I won't disagree with you there.GUILFOYLE: I prefer your comments last night as we were watching the returns come in and you were crushing red wine.GUTFELD: What was I saying?GUILFOYLE: Yes. And you were saying, write it down. You'll forget to say. Oh, I won't forget, Kimberly now the placement Hillary and...GUTFELD: Oh, I didn't say that.BOLLING: Oh, yes. Let's move on, shall we?PERINO: Can I mention one thing about Bernie? It's this one point.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: How dare you!PERINO: That he really relied on millennials and young people and they did not turn out. They turn out to his rallies but the turnout at the caucuses was not as strong as what Hillary was able to turnout with seniors who overwhelmingly supported her more than millennials supported Bernie.WILLIAMS: Isn't that interesting. And also, you can divide it by incomes. People of upper incomes and even moderate incomes supported Hillary.PERINO: Yes.WILLIAMS: It was young people and people of lower income who supported...BOLLING: Yes. Because they don't have to pick up the tab.WILLIAMS: Oh, wait -- wait a minute. I thought you were a Bernie supporter because you hated Hillary.BOLLING: No, I want him. I want him to have the nomination.WILLIAMS: Yes. So, you can beat him.GUILFOYLE: So, he can be beaten.WILLIAMS: So, you can beat him up.GUILFOYLE: But he is too expensive. We can't afford him. We're going to have to export him to another country. Perhaps and I'm sure he would quite like it. Like done as well. Greg, what do have for us?GUTFELD: I know a lot of people are focusing on the candidates but I find that very boring.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: I'm always interested in finding out about that person behind the scenes. The person behind the person if you catch my drift. Hopefully it's not Bill Clinton. But it might be somebody behind Bill Clinton. If you see behind Bill, you see this young fellow. Right there. There he is. That's a -- he's a Drake University student, Peter Clinksdale (ph) is his name.GUILFOYLE: Is that the guy from the plane that was after me? Remember the one that was...(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Well, you're going to have to be more specific.GUILFOYLE: OK.GUTFELD: But any way, I don't know, he is very emotional. He looks like he's imitating a fish.WILLIAMS: Is that his fang?GUTFELD: But he's stuck on Hillary because he's got stickers all over his face. Although he could be a Sanders plant. We're not quite sure. But he tried to speak.GUILFOYLE: Did you do an investigation?GUTFELD: I'm too lazy to investigate. I just thought the video was fantastic.GUILFOYLE: So, wow. Is that it?GUTFELD: That's it.GUILFOYLE: Is it time for Twitter Tuesday?GUTFELD: You know it. you know it, yes.GUILFOYLE: You know it. Well, with Iowa in the book, New Hampshire is next. The candidates are staked out across the state today. The war games, that battle when The Five returns. And Menudo.GUTFELD: And Menudo.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Hey, with Iowa behind in the presidential candidates they are -- I'm so tired -- are full throttle today in New Hampshire where the first primary of 2016 is going to take place next Tuesday. Three governors in the race. Bush, Kasich and Christie are pinning their hopes on the state to get their campaigns back in play. Donald Trump is predicting to come back. And Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are also optimistic about the next contest ahead of them. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: You all treat politics in New Hampshire like we treat football in Texas. There are millions of Americans who are counting on each and every one of you to vet the candidates.RUBIO: We need your help. We're here.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. All right.RUBIO: A week from today I need your vote here in New Hampshire.JEB BUSH, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When you run for president, you got to show your heart. I'm excited to be here the next seven days to do that here in New Hampshire.CHRIS CHRISTIE, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You are going to make some big decisions this week and I hope you make them in my direction. If you do, we'll win on Tuesday night. I'll just do well but we'll win.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: All right. So, there's a quite a pivot, Greg, when you go from Iowa to New Hampshire. Cruz had a lot about the Evangelicals about 70 percent of the state. You know, that's not the case in New Hampshire. It's a little bit in New Hampshire, it always, they tend to do the opposite. But can Cruz pull off a win in New Hampshire, too?GUTFELD: I don't know. I did some research on New Hampshire. It is a very interesting state.PERINO: OK.GUTFELD: It gave Ronnie James Dio, the late Ronnie James Dio, singer from Rainbow, Black Sabbath, Dio, and of course, your favorite band, Elf. ""Dogpatch"" from Li'l Abner was based on Seabrook. ""Jumanji"" was filmed in Keane.But the most interesting thing about New Hampshire it's where you go to hide. In both The Sopranos and Breaking Bad, central characters went to New Hampshire to hide. So, their new motto should be, New Hampshire, no one looks here. I think that would work.PERINO: I think that's a beautiful state.GUTFELD: Yes, it is.PERINO: Do you want to comment on the politics?GUTFELD: Absolutely not. I don't want to comment on it. I'm so politic out.PERINO: All right.GUTFELD: My brain is fried.PERINO: OK. Well, then...GUTFELD: Who are you?PERINO: And then...GUTFELD: Megyn, you did you a great job in the debate.PERINO: Thank you, thank you. Kimberly, do you need my help?(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Are you going to help me?PERINO: Yes, all right.GUILFOYLE: OK.PERINO: In Iowa the polls showed that Trump was going to win. In New Hampshire, polls show Trump is going to win. Do you think the polls are more accurate in New Hampshire than Iowa?GUILFOYLE: Well, statistically speaking, they by and large, they are considerable margin of errors. So, you would say that in fact that they are. Because he enjoys that quite sizable lead in New Hampshire.Of course, then you have other people with momentum. Let's see as we get in a little bit closer. I don't think anybody is taking anything for granted or going to kind of, you know, rest on their laurels.We also saw the effectiveness of having a highly calibrated ground game and that worked very well for Cruz and for Marco Rubio. Marco Rubio didn't talk about his ground game as much but he did deliver it. So, I think them...(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Maybe they'll take it for Granite.GUILFOYLE: Oh, you want to get back in now.GUTFELD: The Granite state.PERINO: You're just like a minute and a half behind today.GUTFELD: Yes, I am.PERINO: We'll come back -- we'll come back to you in a minute.WILLIAMS: Do you know why that is? Do you know why that is, though? He's the old man on the mountain.PERINO: I know what that means.GUILFOYLE: I thought he was...PERINO: Let me ask Eric. So Rubio leaves Iowa with a...WILLIAMS: Iowa thing. New Hampshire thing. Thank you.PERINO: OK. Rubio leaves Iowa with some wind at his back. And I didn't know what was going. I checked this out to make sure. He right now is polling as the only one in the race that beats Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire in the general election.BOLLING: Interesting. A few more stats?PERINO: Sure. Only twice has Iowa picked the nominee in this whole caucus process in the last 40 years. Eight times out of ten, New Hampshire has picked the nominee. Interesting that New Hampshire we know is way more secular, as you point out. And also more moderate. So it's going to flip. I think that takes away from the Cruz momentum more than a little bit. Probably more than a little. Marco Rubio is on an up slope. We talked about that. We talked about that over the last few days. I would suggest...GUILFOYLE: Also Kasich and Christie, by the way.BOLLING: So I would say probably Trump and maybe a Rubio, too. Cruz, Kasich and Christie have some fun at third.Money, very quickly -- money is going to be very important. Because of that Rubio win and that performance, I think he's going to get a lot of money over the next two weeks between now and New Hampshire and then South Carolina. That's very important.But also, Donald Trump hasn't spent any money. He'll tell you that. He hasn't spent a lot of money. Let's put it that way. But if he does, and he really wants to win and be president, he needs to start spending some money in New Hampshire now. Because you need the win...PERINO: Didn't he tweet today that he doesn't get any credit for self- funding his campaign, and maybe it's not worth it?BOLLING: I didn't see that.PERINO: I don't know if that's...BOLLING: Hopefully, he sees the importance on the ground.PERINO: Maybe he'll listen to your...BOLLING: The ground game costs a lot of money.GUILFOYLE: Ground game. But you know what?  Sometimes you've...GUTFELD: You can't figure out why he didn't have to spend any money. Still haven't figured that out.PERINO: Really?GUTFELD: No. It's a mystery to you.PERINO: We'll check back with you in a minute, see if you figure it out.Juan, I want to -- I'm going to show you some sound from Hillary and Bernie up in New Hampshire.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am so thrilled that I'm coming to New Hampshire after winning Iowa!We're bringing all that energy, all that excitement, all that determination right here to New Hampshire, where we're going to work hard up until the primary next week.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We just got in from Iowa, where we astounded the world. Now in New Hampshire, we're going to astound the world again.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.PERINO: OK. Bernie is way up in the polls in New Hampshire. I don't know: with Democrats, does Iowa and New Hampshire usually track?WILLIAMS: No.PERINO: Each other now?WILLIAMS: Neither. On either side, Republican or Democrat. What's interesting about New Hampshire is the large number of independents. And you can, in a primary you can vote on either side.So you just to have go in, as a candidate, you are really reaching to the middle in a way that you don't in a state like Iowa with all the evangelicals. Take an issue like abortion, pretty definitive with the evangelical community in Iowa. You don't see that play that way in New Hampshire.And on the Democratic side, I think the question is, should Hillary Clinton really put a whole lot of effort in? Because I think Bernie is going to win as the neighboring guy, right?GUTFELD: She does have a beautiful voice, though. Did you hear that?PERINO: It sounds like she's losing her voice.GUILFOYLE: She can do a duet with Ted Cruz.PERINO: It says -- Eric, here's another stat for you. It is said that in New Hampshire, a candidate needs to actually meet and talk face to face with the voters five times each.BOLLING: That's the number? Interesting, also, that New Hampshire has one-third the population of Iowa. Yet three times the number of voters turn out in New Hampshire than Iowa. Think about that.PERINO: We are filled full of fun facts.GUTFELD: And Iowa...GUILFOYLE: And corny jokes.GUTFELD: ... is a shorter word but has more vowels.GUILFOYLE: God, what a weirdo.GUTFELD: I can even check that.BOLLING: But the same number as Ohio.GUTFELD: Exactly.BOLLING: Interestingly.GUTFELD: Way to go, Ohio.PERINO: You guys are blowing my mind. All right. Next, we answer your questions on last night's election and beyond. So please stick around.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: So on this Twitter Tuesday we're answering some of your questions on the presidential election.So let's begin, Dana.PERINO: OK.GUTFELD: This is from Allison. Not including anything about politics, thank God. ""What surprised you the most about Iowa?""PERINO: Well, it had been a few years since I've been in Des Moines. And I have to say, I love to watch cities redevelop and revitalize. And the downtown area of Des Moines was great.And if you are a young person that wants to start a business, it seemed to me like that would be a really great place to be. The new loft apartments and great little tech businesses, good restaurants, and I got to go to yoga at a winery named Jasper.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: What's better than that?GUTFELD: There's some interesting -- there's some interesting clubs over there, you know, if you're into certain kinds of things. Alternative lifestyles.GUILFOYLE: You were hanging out at the lesbian bar the whole time.GUTFELD: Eric.There's about 13 -- there are about 13 jokes that can go with that.BOLLING: I agree with Dana. Last time I was there was 2008, Michele Bachmann, of '07, when she announced she was going to run for president. And it's a completely different city, a lot of cafes, coffee shops, beautiful bistros in the street. Gorgeous little town. And agreed, a very young town, it seems.PERINO: And the capital is beautiful.WILLIAMS: Oh, I love the capital. Let me just say, I've been there forever, right? The old dog around here. But I must tell you, the weather is the biggest surprise to me, because the weather was great.PERINO: Yes.WILLIAMS: I -- typically, I am afraid of going -- in the summer it's beautiful. But in the winter, Iowa is bitterly cold, and the wind whips. And you just -- because there's nothing to stop it; it's just flat.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: I thought the weather this week was great. And I understand it snowed today.PERINO: A little bit.BOLLING: Just a dusting. We were all freaking out we weren't going to get out.GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: It was going to be a monster snowstorm.GUILFOYLE: A few panic attacks in the bar.GUTFELD: K.G., what surprised you about Iowa? Any other secrets you'd like to tell?GUILFOYLE: Oh, you have no idea. Yes. All right. Well, let's start with, how about the cowboy bar? Uh-huh. That was...PERINO: I can't believe I missed that.GUILFOYLE: Save a horse, ride a cowboy. Some people took that seriously.WILLIAMS: My goodness.GUILFOYLE: And then dinner, food. Eric, that was fantastic. We went to Jethro's Barbecue ""Bacon Bacon Night."" Remember that? So that was very good. Where we had the Elvis pancakes...GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: ... fried bananas, the peanut butter syrup, and The Five-pound sandwich, and then the ribs wrapped in the bacon. It was quite tasty. And then the Bloody Mary with the bacon in it.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: It's on the Internet.GUTFELD: You know what surprised me the most about Iowa? Is like, what is their problem with the letter ""S""? You know, it's -- It should be ""Dess Moine-ess."" They don't pronounce their ""S's"" in Des Moines. What's the problem with the ""S's""? Where did that come from?GUILFOYLE: They keep buying vowels.GUTFELD: Is that it?PERINO: I hate when people buy vowels. It's usually a waste of money.GUTFELD: It really is a waste of money.PERINO: My advice.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: So Gregory, do you know what it means?GUTFELD: No, I -- please tell me, Juan.WILLIAMS: ""The monks.""GUTFELD: Oh, really?WILLIAMS: Yes, monks settled in Des Moines.GUTFELD: There you go. Juan knows some interesting stuff.WILLIAMS: Well, that was crazy.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: It's on that bizarre phone of yours, right?BOLLING: OK.PERINO: Hit us with another one.BOLLING: Monks.GUTFELD: French?WILLIAMS: Yes.GUTFELD: All right. This is from someone named Sports Radio. Talk about having cruel parents. All right. It's just stupid. Why am I here today?GUILFOYLE: We're going to get pulled off the air.GUTFELD: ""Do you think -- do you think...""GUILFOYLE: It's going to happen.GUTFELD: ""Do you think Trump loss"" -- I think he means, ""Do you think the Trump loss will make him come back stronger/better candidate? When he has failed in the past, he always seems to."" I guess mean, ""come back.""PERINO: Well, he only has 140 characters. It's Twitter Tuesday.GUTFELD: That is true.PERINO: Economy of words.GUILFOYLE: That's the problem. People -- yes, they're not writing...GUTFELD: Eliminated the -- yes. Oh, so it's my fault.PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: All right. Let's start with you, K.G. Do you remember the question? Because...GUILFOYLE: I remember that you said it was unfortunate that his parents named him Sports Radio. I think that's not his real name, but we'll go with it. So yes.I think that Donald Trump is not planning on losing New Hampshire. I think he's probably going to take it, because I don't think he's going to allow any other outcome, especially after, you know, placing second in a tight race with Trump [SIC]. That's what you do when you want to win.GUTFELD: Juanzo.WILLIAMS: If Cruz had lost in Iowa, he would be buried. He'd be gone. OK, so he's still around.If Trump loses in New Hampshire, he'll be buried. So I think Trump is going to organize, work harder. I mean, one of the telltale signs for me is...GUILFOYLE: Spend cash.WILLIAMS: ... in Iowa -- you've got to spend cash, as Eric was saying. But one of the telltale signs for me in Iowa was hearing from Cruz people who said they did not see Trump's people on the ground. They didn't see the ground game. And I thought that's weird.BOLLING: Spend the money.WILLIAMS: Yes. So I guess now he's going to have to ante up.BOLLING: Yes. It feels like, with this momentum with Rubio, that Trump is going to do what he has to do to win New Hampshire. And then don't forget, Rubio gotten endorsed by Senator...PERINO: Tim Scott.BOLLING: ... Tim Scott in South Carolina, which is the next ten days after New Hampshire. It's going to -- it feels like Trump and Rubio going down the stretch. And a lot of money will be spent on both sides of that.PERINO: Uh-oh, the Cruz people will be after you.BOLLING: They're -- believe me, they're already after us -- me.PERINO: I have a quick answer.GUTFELD: Sure. Please do.PERINO: I think that we'll know more after Saturday. Because there is -- people have kind of forgotten, there is a Republican debate Saturday night.GUILFOYLE: Yes, Dana.PERINO: And it's hosted by ABC. It's in New Hampshire.WILLIAMS: Is Trump coming?PERINO: I would assume.WILLIAMS: Because I think not showing up...PERINO: Was not a good -- that was not a good decision.Anyway, a lot of -- we saw in the focus groups in the polling that a lot of people in Iowa waited until after that last debate to make up their mind who they were going to vote for. And in New Hampshire we know there's probably about 45 percent of people who have not made a final decision yet. So this debate on Saturday matters.GUILFOYLE: Show up and give them the razzle dazzle.GUTFELD: So I don't answer? OK.GUILFOYLE: Bye.GUTFELD: ""What does a Rubio surprise look like in New Hampshire?"" I don't even know what that means.PERINO: Surprise!GUTFELD: There you go.GUILFOYLE: Reunited, Menudo.GUTFELD: Yes, there you go. Juan.WILLIAMS: Look, he's got...GUILFOYLE: A first-place finish. That would be a surprise.WILLIAMS: Well, he's got -- he's got to beat -- as I was saying, he's got to beat Kasich, you know, Bush, Christie, all that. So he's got to right now. The surprise would be if he was able to come out ahead of all those. Not necessarily win. He's not going to win. I think it is Trump's to lose. But I don't think he can win it.GUILFOYLE: Well, you never know.GUTFELD: Surprise? What do you think?BOLLING: I think he comes in second.PERINO: I actually think the surprise would be if he doesn't place in the top two.GUTFELD: Yes, OK.PERINO: That would be the surprise. How about that? It's the other way around.GUTFELD: Yes. I would be surprised, like, if he went on a crime spree. If he just showed up there and started robbing banks. And he said, ""I never wanted to be president. I just wanted to get to New Hampshire so I could rob some banks.""GUILFOYLE: Robbing boots? Like boots?BOLLING: You know what would be a surprise? If any one of them mentioned faith in their speeches.GUILFOYLE: Here's the thing.GUTFELD: Faith Hill, you mean? She's a fabulous singer.GUILFOYLE: The takeaway about Rubio? Likable.GUTFELD: Yes, that's true.GUILFOYLE: Likable.GUTFELD: Yes. All right.GUILFOYLE: Remember that.GUTFELD: I will. It's forgotten. I have the memory of a fish.OK. Two more candidates left the presidential race last night. Who will exit next? Some final thoughts when ""The Five"" returns. Final...(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: And then there were 11 on the right and two on the left. Mike Huckabee and Martin O'Malley both ending their bid for the presidency after poor showings in the Iowa caucuses last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE HUCKABEE (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: As we come here tonight, it's time to officially suspend the campaign. But not because of the votes. It's because of illness. Obviously, the voters are sick of me, and I need to acknowledge that.MARTIN O'MALLEY (D), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I have to tell you that I am suspending this presidential bid. But I am not ending this fight. Because the fight that you and I are engaged in is a tough fight. And I believe that the toughness of the fight is the way the hidden God of telling us we're actually fighting for something worth saving.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: I know that you were moved by those words from Martin O'Malley, Gregory.GUTFELD: Yes, he suspended his campaign, which I found out was just a hair brush and a bucket of brine shrimp.GUILFOYLE: Mean!GUTFELD: I don't know what he was doing there. I'm serious. He has the presence of a -- of a drain fly. Whenever he was there at the debate, he just kind of was there. I didn't understand it. How can he -- how can he suspend a campaign if he was never there?WILLIAMS: All right. Well, let me say on the Republican side, you know, it looks like Ben Carson didn't do very well. He might be somebody who's thinking, but guess what? He says he was the victim of dirty politics. And today, an apology from Ted Cruz.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Ben Carson is someone whom I respect and admire. Ben and Candy have become friends. We've had dinner together more than once. And he is a man of great character and integrity and principle. I really very much admire him.Last night when CNN posted a news report that Ben was not continuing on to New Hampshire, not continuing on to South Carolina but instead was going to Florida, our political team forwarded it to the members of our team. But unfortunately, they did not then forward the subsequent story that was Ben's campaign clarifying that -- that he was continuing the campaign and was not canceling the campaign.And so I apologized to Ben for that. They should have forwarded that subsequent story. That was a mistake on our part.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Dana, are you buying it?PERINO: Um.WILLIAMS: It doesn't look like it.PERINO: Here's the thing. It's kind of unfortunate. But also, it didn't matter. I don't think that it actually suppressed turnout. I don't think that Ben Carson was going to place in the top three.GUILFOYLE: It shaved points off of other candidates.WILLIAMS: Yes. And also the evangelical vote.GUILFOYLE: I know. That wasn't accidental.BOLLING: I think -- yes, he should have forwarded another e-mail once they cleared it up. But man, CNN, what were they thinking?WILLIAMS: They went for the bait, though.BOLLING: What were they thinking?WILLIAMS: That was reckless.All right. ""One More Thing"" up next.GUILFOYLE: Not to Hannity.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: All righty. Time for ""One More Thing."" I'm going to kick it off.Some great news: FOX News crushed the caucus coverage last night. We were No. 1 in total viewers peaking at 5.1 million viewers, and that's an 80 percent increase over 2008, the last time there was an open Democrat and Republican primary. Get this: It's a whopping 697 percent increase from 2000. So congrats to all who worked so hard to bring you the most watched caucus coverage ever -- Greg.GUTFELD: We peaked with viewers. I peek at viewers sometimes.I'm on ""O'Reilly"" tonight. It will be a disaster. Watch us. Trust me. Not going to be good.GUILFOYLE: I'm on ""O'Reilly"" tonight, and it's amazing.GUTFELD: Yes, well, you're always amazing...GUILFOYLE: ""Is It Legal?""GUTFELD: ... when you're on ""O'Reilly.""All right. Two of my favorite people in the world...GUILFOYLE: Terrible.GUTFELD: ... Hillary Clinton and Rosie O'Donnell, I thought, ""Why don't we just bring them together just to make all of us feel really good?""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROSIE O'DONNELL, FORMER TALK SHOW HOST: Go.HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Hi, Nancy.O'DONNELL (singing): Hi, Helen.CLINTON (singing): What's the story, morning glory?O'DONNELL (singing): What's the tale, nightingale?CLINTON (singing): Tell me quick about Hugo and Tim.O'DONNELL (singing): Hi, Margie.CLINTON (singing): Hi, Alice.O'DONNELL (singing): What's the story, morning glory?CLINTON (singing): What's the word, hummingbird?(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: I did this, because I feel so bad today. Because I haven't had any sleep. I wanted everybody to feel bad.GUILFOYLE: You've accomplished that.Under promised, over-delivered on that one.GUTFELD: Your turn, K.G.GUILFOYLE: OK. So yesterday I had Moose on my chest, remember that?GUTFELD: Yes. Who can forget?GUILFOYLE: So sweet. Pets for Patriots.GUTFELD: It's a dog.GUILFOYLE: Yes. And so now I have a groundhog. Punxsutawney Phil. So he didn't see his shadow in Western Pennsylvania, so as the legends go, apparently now, this means we're going to have an early spring, right?BOLLING: Yes.GUTFELD: Wasn't it the mayor who killed it?GUILFOYLE: If he didn't, it would be six weeks longer.GUTFELD: De Blasio killed it?BOLLING: De Blasio, yes. Dropped it. Dropped it.GUILFOYLE: Didn't he kill the turkey, too? Who killed the turkey?GUTFELD: Staten Island...GUILFOYLE: Pardoned the turkey.PERINO: All right. I'm going to lighten the mood. Do you want to see a baby that can't stop laughing because his pug keeps pushing her over?GUILFOYLE: what?PERINO: Just watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(BABY GIGGLING AS PUG KNOCKS HER OVER)(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: So that's hilarious. That's baby Kennedy. She lives in San Francisco with her two pug friends, Barnum and Bailey. Great names.GUTFELD: That would be funny if that was, like, a tiger.GUILFOYLE: What is wrong with you?PERINO: Dogs and babies are usually a good, safe go-to for ""One More Thing.""GUILFOYLE: Mom -- Mom, can you excuse him from the table? No dinner.WILLIAMS: He's quite amusing. You don't find amusing?GUILFOYLE: No.WILLIAMS: No? You've just got to give him a little...GUILFOYLE: Off (ph) on my wrong foot.WILLIAMS: All right. Back to work. Starting today -- starting today, if you go to Mickey D's and order a Happy Meal, your prize will be a book. That's right.GUILFOYLE: I love it.WILLIAMS: McDonald's is partnering with Reading is Fundamental to give away 100,000 books.Happy Valentine's Day, Moose. I know you don't like Valentine's Day, but that...GUILFOYLE: No, I like that.PERINO: That is so great. I love that McDonald's is doing that.WILLIAMS: Isn't that great? They've got four books they're giving away. And this is the third year, Dana, the fast food restaurant is serving up books.And guess this -- get this. By the end of this year, 2016, they will have given away 50 million books. That's unbelievable.GUILFOYLE: That's fantastic.WILLIAMS: That's really good stuff. McDonald's, that's wonderful.PERINO: That's great.GUILFOYLE: Burger King...PERINO: And if you look at the number of how few books are actually in homes for a lot of children and the impact that has on their lives. I think this is a good idea.  GUILFOYLE: You should donate. Why don't you donate?PERINO: Are you sad that they didn't choose your book?BOLLING: All right. We're going to leave it there. And just to let you know, we flew home with Bret Baier last night and talked about every time we finish with a ""One More Thing"" like this. Bret, what do you think about that? He's like, ""Oh, my gosh.""PERINO: He said he loves it. He loves it.BOLLING: By the way, he's in New York.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Joining me now is the man that George Stephanopoulos went after on ""This Week."" He's the author of ""Clinton Cash,"" now a New York Times bestseller, Peter Schweizer.By the way, the New York Times, Washington Post did their own investigations based on the foundation of your book. They had hard-hitting pieces. He didn't take them on! He didn't disclose this!Here are my questions for you. Do you believe ABC News really did an investigation, or do you think that George Stephanopoulos coordinated perhaps with the Clinton campaign here?PETER SCHWEIZER, AUTHOR, ""CLINTON CASH"": Well, first of all, I know that the investigative unit of ABC News has done reporting on the book, and they have substantiated what I found in the book. And I would encourage people to look at the reporting by Brian Ross and Matt Mosk (ph) on this. They confirm the findings as it relates to speeches in Haiti.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Wait a minute. Do you suspect, then, that George Stephanopoulos was referring -- when he said ABC News has concluded this -- do you think he was basically relying on his relationship with the Clintons to say that?SCHWEIZER: I don't know what he meant when he said that. I mean, that would be a great question to ask him. What did he actually mean when he said ABC News had looked into it. I just don't know what he's referring to there. I think as to the...HANNITY: Go ahead. Go ahead.SCHWEIZER: Well, I said, as far as coordination is concerned, I mean, you have the fact that he's a donor. You have the fact now it's coming out that he has participated in Clinton Global Initiative events as a panelist, as a speaker multiple times.  And it raises this question just about the coziness. I mean, you've got the finances. You've got these -- these meetings that he's attending. How you can expect to be objective, you know, is really highly questionable in that kind of environment.HANNITY: I watched that interview, and I went on TV and radio the next day and I said this was -- this was a set-up interview! He was like their special pleader and advocate! And it did get noticed by a lot of people, and I said once a liberal Clinton hack, always a Clinton liberal hack!Let me go back -- we went back and we found some video footage of some of the history when he was in the war room. This is from a documentary.  And I think this reminds people how close they have been for decades.  Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now, Governor Clinton has a character problem, but I take it that your line...STEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Clinton has no character problem.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Your line of counterattack is that...STEPHANOPOULOS: Bill Clinton's passed his character tests throughout his life and throughout this campaign.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And you're convinced it won't work again?STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm convinced that if they try it, we'll hit them back harder. (INAUDIBLE)STEPHANOPOULOS: Another good night for Bill Clinton, three debates, three wins.STEPHANOPOULOS: It is completely (EXPLETIVE DELETED). If you went on the radio and said that Bill Clinton is the father of an illegitimate black child, you would be laughed at. People would think you're crazy.STEPHANOPOULOS: I guarantee you that if you do this, you'll never work in Democratic politics again.STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm very proud to have done this. I'm just happy as I can be and I'm so proud. We won Nevada big. Governor, we're going to -- I mean, it's looking like close to 400.STEPHANOPOULOS: We ought to be the -- I mean, the happiest man in the world. But I just got to tell you, I mean, I just appreciate this so much. This was the best thing I ever did.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: What is your reaction this now? And what do you want from ABC? What would you like them to do? Because they said they're not going to reprimand him.SCHWEIZER: Well, I think what ABC could do is let's do another interview on the Sunday morning show to talk about the contents of the book, so we actually get a chance for viewers to hear what is in the book.  That's the first thing that I would ask.You know, looking at Stephanopoulos's past, I mean, the question to me is really, going into that interview, I kind of assumed that the relationship with the Clintons was in the past, that he had made this transition into the media and it was a different chapter in his life.These donations, the fact that he's going to these events -- I mean, it just -- it raises all kinds of questions about that, and I think it's legitimate for people to look into them. If this was any other political candidate and a reporter doing this, you can bet that there would be some serious consequences for it.HANNITY: You think this is worse than what Brian Williams -- exaggerating on some of his stories? Do you think this is a bigger ethical issue?SCHWEIZER: I think this is an issue that kind of goes to the issue of trust in the media. You know, if you're embellishing stories, obviously, that's a trust issue. But this is a very, very important one because you're talking about interviewing an author who's written a book that is critical and raises lots of questions about the Clinton Foundation. You're giving money to them, and you don't expose that and explain that to the public. I mean, the argument that he thought it was public and people would know about, you know, is ridiculous!HANNITY: That's absurd.SCHWEIZER: It was public that I was a speech writer for George Bush for three months, but he felt it was important to mention it, and rightfully so, but he doesn't disclose his conflict. It just doesn't make any sense.HANNITY: All right, Peter Schweizer, thank you.  Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST:  And welcome to ""Hannity"" and this is a Fox News Alert.  The results from Iowa are now in.  Fox News is projecting that Texas Senator Ted Cruz is the winner of the Republican Iowa caucuses with almost 28 percent of the vote.  Donald Trump in second with 24 percent, Senator Marco Rubio in third place with 23percent.  And on the Democratic side at this hour, the caucuses are still too close to call, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders now in a dead heat.  Earlier tonight after his big win, Senator Cruz celebrated with his supporters in the Hawkeye state.  Let's take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  God bless the great state of Iowa.  Tonight is a victory for the grassroots.  Tonight is a victory for courageous conservatives across Iowa and all across this great nation.  And the next president of the United States will not be chosen by the media, will not be chosen by the lobbyists, will not be chosen by the Washington establishment.  But will be chosen by the most incredible, powerful force, where all sovereignty resides in our nation by we the people, the American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Joining us now with a reaction from The Washington Times, Charles Hurt, Fox News contributor Kirsten Powers, and Fox News legal analyst Peter Johnson Jr.  Welcome you all.What a night.  So many different story lines, one, the media and the polls wrong again.  Just like in 2000, 2004, 2008.  Two, if you add up Trump and Cruz and Carson, you've got over 60 percent of Republicans, an anti- establishment night, an insurgency year this is turning into and three, Hillary the big loser of the night, Peter Johnson Jr.?PETER JOHNSON JR., FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST:  Yeah, I think you're hitting a lot of the points here.  We're seeing a three-person race at this point, big night for Marco Rubio, big night for Ted Cruz.  Bad night for Donald Trump proved that he's not what the press was saying that he was.  He is invincible.  He may not be indomitable.  He is vulnerable.  He's still a great candidate and a viable candidate, but he's got his problems going forward.  And obviously, he made some mistakes in terms of skipping the Fox debate and some other tactical issues.  So, we've seen Trump, the bubble has burst tonight.  HANNITY:  I don't know if I -- I might disagree with you, Peter.  I would actually say the Republicans, the top three all had a big win in some way.   Here's my analysis.  All right, Ted Cruz proves hard work pays off.  He does the full Grassley, all 99 counties, retail politics pays off.  Trump on paper, in a state that Huckabee and Santorum won, probably I think his analysis was right.  He probably didn't get the advice from political experts, don't go to Iowa.  It's probably a hard state for you to win.  And third, I'd say yeah, Marco Rubio outperformed all expectations and all the poll numbers. Big win for him in that regard. What is your take?JOHNSON:  I would just say, there's a difference between fandom and supporters.  A lot of people will go see Donald Trump at a rally because they loved his television show, they like what he has to say.  But the Cruz folks, the Rubio folks, those people were supporters.  They came out and they worked this election.  And the results show.  The results show.HANNITY:  Yeah no, absolutely, listen, organization still matters.  I think, you know, Charles, we've got to admit here, you know, Iowa is a retail political state, and people expect to be courted and have their -- for you to shake their hands and kiss their babies and go to their meetings and have coffee in their coffee shops.  And for the most part, Trump defied that, let's say, typical model or old-fashioned model.  CHARLES HURT, THE WASHINGTON TIMES:  Sure. And, you know, Ted Cruz's victory tonight, you cannot take it away from him.  It's tremendous.HANNITY:  Agreed.  HURT:  He got a record number of - you know, in history of Republican caucusgoers.  So, it's tremendous.  But the flip side of it is, and you touched on this, you know, look at the, you know, the Iowa GOP caucusgoers don't have a terrific record in the past of picking the eventual winner.   And the last few times you have Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee.  And Ted Cruz very much played, you know, used their playbook.  As Peter had said, huge ground game.  He went all in there.  You know, courted -- went, you know, statewide.  And ultimately had to win, and also used -- was very overtly religious about courting evangelical voters. And so, while it's a tremendous victory, if you look back at the past couple, you know, the past 16 years, it doesn't necessarily translate into places like New Hampshire and then going forward.  HANNITY:  But you know what? He did show hard work pays off.  HURT:  Yes.  HANNITY:  Going to all 99 counties pays off.  Retail politics works.  And he's still in second in New Hampshire.  Now it'll be interesting to see polls in the next two or three days.  Although, I think quoting polls should be a thing of the past.  Kerstin, there's no doubt in my mind, the biggest loser tonight is Hillary Clinton.  She could spin it any way she wants.  What I saw tonight was a very angry candidate, very frustrated.  Ed Henry reporting that, she was posted to a rope line.  It was supposed to be a big celebration.  And then she literally shifts radically to the left on gay rights, on free tuition, on Obamacare.  I mean, she sounded like Bernie Sanders in her speech, except an angrier, insincere version.  KIRSTEN POWERS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yeah, I agree with almost everything that you said.  So, first of all she can't celebrate because the results haven't been, you know, really called yet.  So there's nothing to celebrate.  But here is the thing.  In the same way that Ted Cruz had to win Iowa, Bernie Sanders really had to win Iowa. Hillary, this is not a state that is built for Hillary because it was an extreme -- it's already an extremely liberal electorate in a normal caucus.  And if you look at the numbers that we've had tonight, you have 10 percent more people identifying as very liberal than you even had in 2008.  So, it was already a very liberal electorate, maybe even more liberal.  You have 43 percent of likely caucusgoers had identified in a recent poll as -- themselves as socialists.  So, these are people that are predisposed to Bernie Sanders.  And Hillary Clinton had to do is, she kind of had to hold him at bay and it really was Bernie's to lose.  So, I don't think you can read so much into this in terms of how this is going to affect Hillary down the road.  Because this is, and again -- and the other thing is, this is an extremely white state.  And she does much better, she is going to end up doing much better probably with African- American voters.  And so I think -- I really think you can over read this, Shawn, because you, you know, you hate Hillary.  HANNITY:  No, it's not that I hate Hillary.  And I'll tell you what.  When you compare the speeches tonight, Peter Johnson Jr., Bernie Sanders to me, he's a true believer.  He's the real deal.  He's a socialist.  Hillary, angry, shifting on the fly, seeming to be the politician, she'll become whatever she needs to be to win.  And I don't think anger and switching your opinions and your core values is going to win you the race in the long run.  JOHNSON:  I think older and younger voters both, even when they don't agree with Bernie Sanders, and I vigorously disagree, and I know you do, they say there is an honesty about him.  There's an integrity in terms of his beliefs, no matter how misguided, there's a fervor, there's a deep decency that he exemplifies.  There's a belief system that transcends money and power and connections and e-mails, and people say, ""Yeah, that's the America that I want,"" as much as he is misguided.  I saw the same thing in Rubio's speech tonight.  A young vital guy, a guy strong enough to say, ""I'm proud of my immigrant roots even when some candidates want to attack immigrants.""  I see this as the face of a new Republican party that's shaking out tonight.  HANNITY:  Yeah.  JOHNSON:  Two of the top three Hispanic Americans who pulled themselves up by their bootstraps.  That's the Republican Party.  That's not the Democratic Party.  HANNITY:  Well said.  JOHNSON:  That's what I saw tonight.  HANNITY:  And Charles, you've been pretty much a strong supporter of Donald Trump.  I've got to believe now, especially after New Hampshire, that a lot of these candidates are going to begin to drop out.  It seems to me, the establishment will coalesce around Marco Rubio.  It's interesting to me because he was a tea party favorite back in 2010.  And but for comprehensive immigration reform, I think he would've had a lot more support from conservatives.  But that's been a big obstacle for him.  HURT:  Yeah, and of course, that's also going to be a very big problem for Ted Cruz going forward.  If the establishment does start pressuring some of the other candidates to get out so that that money and that support can go behind some establishment person, I think that that -- it's not going to hurt just Donald Trump, it's going hurt Ted Cruz as well.  But going back to something -- you know, you were talking about how so many people got everything wrong here.  One of my favorite things that got wrong that we saw tonight that was clearly wrong was that, very gracious concession speech that Donald Trump gave.  Everyone, every single one, everybody in the media predicted that if he suffered a single little loss somewhere, he would lose it.  He couldn't handle it.  Everything would fall apart.  And that's not at all what happened.  He walked out there.  He thanked Iowa.  He said he was honored to come in second place.  And he reminded people that he had no business coming in second place which is true.  He had no business coming in second place in Iowa, yet he did.  HANNITY:  You know, Peter, I actually agree with Charles on this.  JOHNSON:  I do too.  HANNITY:  Because on paper, it's not a state that I think anyone would've predicted that he would even be competing in.  JOHNSON:  It's incredible that he did as well as he did coming from where he started.  And the Donald Trump that I saw tonight is the Donald Trump that I know well and that I like.  I represented Donald Trump.  I disagree with him on a lot of things that he's done and that he said.  But I do believe that he has the good of the country in mind.  And if he can start to talk about policies and facts and proposals and a way forward, then he can win this nomination.  If he doesn't, he will lose.  And this is the breaking point from now.  HANNITY:  Would you say, Peter, two improvements that his campaign could make, one is organization.  Ted Cruz had a phenomenal organization.  JOHNSON:  Right.HANNITY:  If he duplicates that in New Hampshire and South Carolina, he will be a formidable candidate.  If Rubio continues this, he will be formidable. It seems to me, organization was lacking for trump in Iowa, number one.  And number two, yeah, I agree with both you guys.  That's a side of Trump that's humble, there was empathy there, a little humility, and a graciousness that I think would serve him well if he continues it.  JOHNSON:  Personally, there's a kindness and there's a generosity about him in so many things that people haven't seen, that it hasn't come through, all that being said, he lost in the state of Iowa, as much as he said that he was going to win.  And all the polls were wrong.  And a lot of the people who said that they were going to vote for him didn't for whatever reason.  They need to understand why they didn't.  HANNITY:  Yeah, certainly a big night for Ted Cruz by winning.  New Hampshire is now, what, a week from today.  If we're looking at the real hours Eastern Time, all right, I've got one last question for Kerstin because Kerstin, I want to go back.  Whether it's 49.8 for Hillary and 49.6 for Bernie Sanders, how do you say that that's a win when she was the front-runner the entire time?  There was an expectation that she'd run away with this?  POWERS:  Well, there was an expectation before Bernie Sanders really became a serious candidate and took off.  And she has, you know, an opponent.  And if you're going to look at this state, this is a state that is much more favorable to Bernie Sanders in a million different ways.  I mean, I listed them. I didn't even get into all the different -- there are many other ways that it favors him.  And so, I think if you look at this state, it's not representative of most other states and then, certainly not the states that are going to be coming after New Hampshire.  And I think that he should've won.  In the same way I think that, you know, I think on the Republican side, I don't think Donald Trump needed to win here.  I think if you had one, it would have been a huge deal. It would have been a game changer to a certain extent, but he didn't need to win. Ted Cruz needed to win because this state is built for Ted Cruz and Ted Cruz had poured everything into it.  So, you know, I think she through organization was able to kind of hold him at bay.  But I don't think this was a state, running against him, where she was thrown a farewell.  HANNITY:  All right guys.  Thanks for being with us and staying up late.   We appreciate it.  POWERS:  Thank you.  HANNITY:  Coming up, we'll have a lot more analysis on the breaking news tonight out of Iowa.  Senator Ted Cruz, he comes out on top of the Republicans on the Democratic side at this hour, the race still too close to call between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. We'll check in with Monica Crowley, Doug Schoen.  They'll weigh in next as we continue.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I stand here tonight, breathing a big sigh of relief. Thank you, Iowa.  I will keep fighting for you.  I will always work to achieve the America that I believe in, where the promise of that dream that we hold out to our children and our grandchildren never fade but inspires generations to come.  Join me.  Let's go win the nominations.  Thank you all and god bless you!SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT.,  DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  If I think about what happened tonight, I think the people of Iowa have sent a very profound message to the political establishment, to the economic establishment, and by the way, to the media establishment.  That is, given the enormous crises facing our country.  It is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  All right, that was Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders addressing their supporters earlier tonight.  At this hour, the Iowa dramatic caucuses still too close to call with the candidates now in a virtual tie.  Joining us now, Fox News contributors Monica Crowley, Doug Schoen, Doug, you know, I watched Bernie Sanders.  And when do I see a guy that's sincere and honest and true to his beliefs, it's coming from his heart.  Now, he's wrong on everything and he's a socialist.  And I watched Hillary Clinton, an angry politician, upset she didn't win.  And then she makes this dramatic shift tonight.  Gay rights, abortion, ObamaCare, free college, global warping, and she tries to sound like Bernie Sanders.DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, all true.  Look, the key tonight is she did not lose.  It's a tie.  Bernie Sanders had a good night.  But she was not rebuked.  HANNITY:  Doug, this is a bad night for her. She lost.SCHOEN:  Sean ...HANNITY:  Let me help you.  She lost.  SCHOEN:  Sean, I don't need the help.  But trust me.  By not losing, she is able to maintain her firewall in the south.  This is good news for her, a lot better than a lot of people expected when they saw the turnout numbers.  HANNITY:  Monica, I disagree with our friend Doug.  I think this is a huge loss for Hillary.  I don't care how you spin it.  They did not think Bernie Sanders would take Iowa.  MONICA CROWLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTORS:  Correct.  I mean, look.  This fact that Bernie Sanders was able to fight Hilary Clinton to a tie, to a statistical draw in the state of Iowa is an astonishing achievement for Bernie Sanders.  After all, he's a 74 year old disheveled socialist.  And he basically tied wit the prohibitive favorite.  Remember, Sean, 12 months ago, Hillary Clinton was leading Bernie Sanders by a whopping 50 points.  And tonight it's too close to call.  She will go in to New Hampshire a very wounded and bloodied candidate.  He is going to clobber her.  HANNITY:  And get killed.  CROWLEY:  Yes, he's going to clobber her in the state of New Hampshire.   Right, so, you know, the point is, that they had to wound her at the polls, weaken her going into the south.  And then, you know, with the FBI investigation hanging over her head, they could go in for the coup de grace.  HANNITY:  All right, let's go to the Republican side.  Doug, let's get your take.  SCHOEN:  Sure.  HANNITY:  Ted Cruz worked the hardest.  Had the best organization, did the full Grassley, 99 counties and shook every hand, played retail politics.   Hard work pays off for him.  Now, analysis, does he take that moment into New Hampshire?  SCHOEN:  I think he will.  There's a couple of buts.  First, will Donald Trump be able to maintain the level of support he's had?  I'm not sure if he will.  And second, the big question is, will Marco Rubio be able to consolidate the so-called establishment Republican support that's been divided three or four-ways and become a real alternative to either Cruz or Trump, more likely Cruz.  That to me is the big question.  HANNITY:  You know, but Monica, as I stated at the beginning of the show, over 60 percent of the vote in Iowa, which by the way reflected the polls that show the Republicans feel betrayed by Washington Republicans, over 60 percent of that vote went to insurgency candidates.  CROWLEY:  Yeah.  HANNITY:  So I'm, you know, to me, if that model continues, even if the establishment coalesces around Marco, does that work?  CROWLEY:  Well, there's a huge lesson coming out of Iowa.  Sean, you hit the nail on the head.  A little over 60 percent went for anti-establishment candidates.  That is Cruz, Trump, and Ben Carson who got almost 10 percent.  And there, I think he was a drag on Ted Cruz.  Whereas Marco Rubio perhaps, in the strong third place finish was perhaps a drag on Donald Trump.  Look, New Hampshire is a much more favorable state for Donald Trump.  So, I don't think the game is over quite yet.  But this win for Ted Cruz was huge.  It was well-deserved.  It was well earned.  He established a traditional and very effective ground game, infrastructure, organization, and it paid off.  But I think there's something bigger going on here, Sean.  And it gets to your question.  I think is the big lesson tonight is that the establishment, frankly, on both sides, is losing power and control.  Ted Cruz stood up to them.  And in particular, the all-powerful ethanol lobby in Iowa, and he won.  That's a lesson for Ted Cruz to carry forth, Donald Trump to carry forth and anybody else who really wants to continue to be viable in this race.  HANNITY:  And Doug, if I'm going to look down the line here, I think we're going to have a general election where America's going to have a very clear choice.  It's going to be a conservative versus a radical left socialist or one that wants to be one.  So, this is going to be a choice election, probably the likes of which we've not seen, maybe since 1980.  SCHOEN:  Well, that is certainly the case.  I would say from Hillary Clinton and the Clinton camp's point of view, they would much prefer to run against Ted Cruz than Donald Trump.  So, this was in that sense, good news also for the Clintons.  CROWLEY:  You know what's interesting too, Sean, when I was listening in particular to Marco Rubio, Donald Trump, and I think Ted Cruz also, they said, ""Well, we're going to defeat the Democrats whether the Democrats nominate Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, or whomever.""  And I just think that is a very important point to make because there is this huge sword of Damocles hanging over Hillary Clinton with the FBI scandal.  Bernie Sanders, you know, even though he pulled out this fantastic success tonight, I don't think he can win a general election. So, I think the jury is still out on the Democrats.  The ultimate nominee may be  neither of these two.  HANNITY:  I think you're probably right.  All right, we got a lot more to come.  The amazing thing's, we're only a week away from New Hampshire.  Now it moves very, very quickly.  Thank you both for being with us.  SCHOEN:  Thank you.  CROWLEY:  Thanks Sean.  HANNITY:  And coming up, more reactions and analysis to the big political news tonight out of Iowa.  We'll check in with Steve Hayes, Penny Lee, Geraldo Rivera.  That's next as this edition of ""Hannity"" continues.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  On June 16th, when we started this journey, there were 17 candidates.  I was told by everybody, do not go to Iowa.  You could never finish even in the top 10.  And I said, ""But I have friends in Iowa. I know a lot of people in Iowa. I think they'll really like me. Let's give it a shot.""  They said, don't do it.  I said, ""I have to do it.""  And we finished second.  And I want to tell you something.  I'm just honored. I'm really honored.We will go on to get the Republican nomination, and we will go on to easily beat Hillary or Bernie or whoever the hell they throw up there.  Iowa we love you, we thank you. You're special. We will be back many, many times.  In fact, I think I might come here and buy a farm.  I love it.   (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  All right, that was Donald Trump earlier tonight, speaking to a crowd of his supporters after finishing second in the Iowa caucuses behind Senator Ted Cruz.  Here with reaction, from The Weekly Standard, Steve Hayes, Democratic strategist Penny Lee, and Fox News, senior correspondent Geraldo Rivera.  Geraldo, I actually am certain that he probably got that advice about Iowa, considering it's a state that Huckabee and Santorum won in years gone by. And I actually believed everything he said, on paper it wasn't a state you'd expect he'd compete in.  And I think, you know, at the end of the day.  GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  Come on, Sean.  Come on.   HANNITY:  Come on what?  RIVERA:  You know, I love the guy but Donald Trump was ...HANNITY:  It's not about loving the guy.RIVERA:  He was the biggest loser by far tonight.  He lost the aura of inevitability.  You know, I thought that, you know, after reading the last 13 or 15 polls that he had done it.  He had defied everything that all those expectations, you know, those preconceptions that he just mentioned, and that you were amplifying.  I thought that he was going to win and run the table.  And Ted Cruz was right about that.  If he had won in Iowa, he would run the table.  HANNITY:  Geraldo, Geraldo!  RIVERA:  But he didn't ...HANNITY:  But Geraldo ...RIVERA:  Cruz did and, you know, I think that we're in for a long slog.  HANNITY:  No, no, no.  You got to listen to me.  I pointed out every single night in the last week that the polls were way off in 2000, way off in '04, way off in '08, way off in 2012, and I said to everybody on the show, don't trust these polls.  They're never right.  Steve Hayes, you're not a Trump supporter in any way.  And you've got to admit, I bet he got that advice when he got into this race.  STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD:  Yeah, he may well have gotten that advice.  And look, whether he got that advice or not, he's right.  It's the way that he explains the situation.  People didn't think Donald Trump could come in second in Iowa.  People didn't think he'd be competitive for the Republican nomination.  And here he is. I mean, I think that is a testament to the campaign that he's run thus far.  But I think Geraldo's right about the immediate take away from tonight.  Donald trump was seen as the likely victor in the last 11 of the last 12 public polls taken until yesterday.  He was the likely winner, and I think people assumed, myself included that this enthusiasm would generate a turnout that would be a Donald Trump turnout.  In fact, it generated a turnout for everybody else too.  HANNITY:  But if the polls are wrong in 2004, '04, '08 and 2012.  Go back to 2012, Rick Santorum never had above 18 percent of the vote.  In those years, these polls have been off anywhere between 8 and 25 percentage points which is why I kept warning the audience, don't listen to these polls.  Penny Lee, on that side, the Democratic side, you've got to admit this was a horrible night, the biggest loser of the night by far is Hillary Clinton.  PENNY LEE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Sean, why didn't I expect for you the say that.  Absolutely you were going to say that.   HANNITY:  Was she a winner tonight?  LEE:  Absolutely she was a winner.  Look, Iowa is the perfect state for Bernie Sanders.  You have 43 percent of the electorate, of the Democratic electorates saying that they are socialists.  He underperformed in his own base.  So, this was a win for Hillary Clinton, by far.  And she's going to go out there.  She's going to compete heavily.  And she's going to go into the south.  HANNITY:  He had three percent when he started in this race.  She was anointed. This was a horrible night for her.   LEE:  She was anointed by those, similar to you, capsizing (ph) those that put faith in their polls.  She never believed those polls.  At that point, that was name identification.  She won tonight.  HANNITY:  Now Geraldo.  RIVERA:  I think Fox News also won, Sean.  I think that we showed or Fox News proved that you can't, you know, disrespect the network or the anchors and pass on an important debate, particularly when it's the last one before the voting.  I think he was punished for that.  I think Marco Rubio is by far the biggest winner, bigger than Ted Cruz.  Ted Cruz like Hillary Clinton or like Bernie Sanders, rather.  Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz, they pushed them on the side.  They're over there ...HANNITY:  Can I just ask you a question?  How can you come up to that conclusion?  RIVERA:  Wait a minute.  Wait, about Marco Rubio?  HANNITY:  How do you come to that conclusion?  When Ted Cruz went to 99 counties, was not predicted in the polls really to win going back for the last six or eight polls.  And he ends up winning by a pretty decent amount.  And then yeah, Marco Rubio outperformed polls that have been tremendously inaccurate over the years.  I agree. Marco had a good night.  And Cruz won.  So, you can't is say, Marco is the big winner, but Marco had a good night.  RIVERA:  I think that Marco had a spectacular night.  I am not a big particular fan of Marco Rubio.  I think he had a terrific night.  When you look at Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders, they're very similar.  They're polar opposites.  They're not going to go very far being on the edge, is one on the right and one on the left.  I think, Rubio now is the establishment candidate.  The biggest losers of all are Bush and Kasich and Christie and all those people who've paid $30,000 for every vote they got tonight.  I think that they really are marginalized.  I think Marco Rubio will be the establishment candidate going forward.  I think Donald -- Donald Trump will now have to scrap and fight.  Hopefully he can -- not hopefully, I don't mean to characterize it in a personal way.  But I think that Donald Trump can't possibly redeem ...HANNITY:  No, you meant hopefully because you said you support him.  You meant what you say.  RIVERA:  I love him.  I don't necessarily support him.  But I think that ...HANNITY:  Wait a minute.  You told me last night you would vote for him today if you were in Iowa.   RIVERA:  If I was in Iowa and a Republican.  You asked me very specifically.  If i was an Iowa and Republican, who would I vote for.  I'm not an Iowan Republican.  I'm a New York Republican.  I think that Donald Trump could possibly redeem himself in New Hampshire.  But now it's not a slam-dunk anymore. Now, we'll go into the polls next Tuesday thinking now I wonder.  Now people are going to start thinking about, Donald Trump, he's all bluster.  Like that concession speech he made tonight was so lame.  He's going to buy a farm in Iowa. He's not going to buy a farm in Iowa. He may never go back to Iowa.  It sounded disingenuous.  HAYES:  Now I don't agree with that at all, Sean.  RIVERA:  It came disorganized.  HAYES:  I disagree with you.  I thought he was ...HANNITY:  He showed graciousness.  HAYES:  Yeah, I agree.  RIVERA:  Compare to it Rubio's.  HAYES:  That's exactly wrong.  No, that was a terrific concession speech.   I think that was one of the better speeches that I've heard Donald Trump give.  He was gracious.  He was short and he was to the point.  He congratulated the other candidates.  RIVERA:  Absolutely.   HAYES:  And he moved on.  RIVERA:  He didn't give anyone a reason why they should vote for him.  HAYES:  I thought it was good moment for Donald Trump, honestly.  RIVERA:  Why should they vote for him based on that concession speech, because he loves them, because he has a beautiful family which he does?  HAYES:  Well look, he could've added some policy, sure.  Sure, he could've added some policy ...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  Gerald, let me tell you what it is.  Because he was gracious, he also pointed out something that I think was fairly obvious, that he was told not to go there.  And to me, I think if I was Donald Trump's campaign, I'd work on two things, organization and more specifics on issues to inspire people and tell people why he's in this race.  In other words, is he in it to Rubio?  RIVERA:  Compare it to Rubio.  HANNITY:  Well Rubio gave his stump speech.  RIVERA:  He gave his stumps (ph).  So, Donald should've given his.  HANNITY:  Right.  RIVERA:  You've got to have five points or four points or I'm going be -- I'm going to be good ...HANNITY:  But that's not what a concession speech is.  RIVERA:  But Marco Rubio managed to make third place, first place.  How does that happen?  HANNITY:  Only in your mind, Geraldo.  That doesn't make it true.  Penny, go ahead, last word.  LEE:  Well, there's many -- there's 48 more states to go.  This is going to be a long race.  Nothing was determined tonight.  It was only one state.   And we've got 48 more to go.  HANNITY:  All right guys, thank you all for being with us.  Appreciate it.  Coming up, we'll have more reaction of the results out of Iowa.  Senator Ted Cruz, the big winner for the Republicans, and at this hour, too close to call for the Democrats, that and more as, HANNITY continues straight ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Well, this is a moment they've said would never happen.  For months, for months they told us we had no chance.  For months they told us because we offered too optimism in the time of anger, we had no chance.  For months they told us, because we didn't have the right endorsements, or the right political connections, we had no chance.  They told me that we have no chance because my hair wasn't  gray enough and my boots were too high.  They told me I needed to wait my turn, that I needed to wait in line. Now, the moment has arrived for this generation of Americans to rise up to the calling of our heritage.  Now the time has come for us to take our place and do what we must.  And when I'm elected president of these great United States, we will do our part.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  All right, that was Florida senator, Marco Rubio speaking earlier tonight after placing third in the Iowa Republican caucuses.  Joining us now are CRN-KRLA radio host, Larry Elder, Democratic poster and strategist, Jessica Tarlov.  And Larry, I think I can make a pretty strong case that is now a three man race and that, all three of the top republican candidates have a story to tell thoughts.  LARRY ELDER, CRN-KRLA RADIO HOST:  Absolutely, I haven't had this much fun since I attended my best friend's bachelor party.  You know, if I were a Democrat ...HANNITY:  Wow.  ELDER:  ... I'd be worried.  HANNITY:  That must've been a boring bachelor party.  ELDER:  On the one hand, you have a candidate who should be indicted, if she's not, facing a 74-year-old Democratic socialist who looks like he sleeps in his car and she barely beat him.  On the other side, the top four ...HANNITY:  We don't even know if she won.ELDER:  That's right.  On the other hand, on the Republican side, Sean, the top four finishers include two Cuban-Americans and a black man.  Talk about rebranding a party that's perceived to be the party of exclusion, the racist party.  And back in 2008, you had a young, dynamic, articulate, feisty senator squaring off against an establishment's 70-year-old.  And in 2016, you may very well have a young dynamic senator squaring off against an establishment, a near 70-year-old.  Not the kind of optics I'd want to go into the fall with if I were a Democrat.  HANNITY:  Well said.  Jessica, I know that, you know, Democrats are trying to spin their way out of the bad night for Hillary.  Hillary lost tonight.   I mean, whether she actually won by like, a tenth of a point, it doesn't matter.  She was not supposed to lose tonight.  JESSICA TARLOV, DEMOCRATIC POSTER & STRATEGIST:  Well, a lot of people were saying, if you judged it by where the momentum was going, that she actually was supposed to lose tonight.  And we know that her firewall really starts in South Carolina then moving to the Super Tuesday states.  But I thought Iowa was winnable for Hillary.  You know, when Ann Selzer says it's possible, you listen.  And I think that this was undoubtedly a good night for Bernie Sanders.  But it also wasn't the end of  the world for Hillary Clinton.  I think she will lose in New Hampshire.  But as we head to the south, I think that she looks really strong.  And to Larry's point, you know, about how -- actually now the Republicans have the diversity there, I'm wondering then, why Democrats are leading by so much with Latinos, with black voters, with Muslim voters.  HANNITY:  Well, we'll see.  TARLOV:  Well, that's kind of the polls today.  I mean, today you said, we have Marco Rubio, we have Ted Cruz.  And I'm asking you where the Latino support is for the Republican  party even with those two  fellows doing really well.  HANNITY:  Well they don't have a candidate yet.  Let's see.  Larry?  TARLOV:  Well, you have like a thousand candidates and none of them are appealing to the minorities.  HANNITY:  Okay but you ...ELDER:  When we get down to a two-person race and then we'll figure it out but Sean, let's say something about Donald Trump.  You're absolutely right that several months ago, nobody expected this kind of finish.  But this is an expectations game and Donald Trump's problem in my opinion Sean, is deeper than the fact that he just didn't meet expectations let alone, exceed them.  He is not a conservative.  He's got positions all over the place.  He's anti-free trade.  In the not too distant past, he was pro-choice.  He said, ""Let's replace ObamaCare"" quote, ""With something better,"" as if another top down solution is better than the one we have right now.  That's his problem going forward against two very articulate, very strong fiscal and social conservatives.  He's in trouble from a policy standpoint, not just from a personality or stylistic stand point, in my opinion.HANNITY:  You know, but you've got to admit this, Larry.  That, you know, when you add Trump's numbers and Cruz's numbers and Ben Carson's numbers, you've got over 60percent of the Republican base in Iowa saying that they don't like the establishment.  And the same thing on the Democratic side.  ELDER:  Absolutely.  HANNITY:  I mean, so ...ELDER:  Absolutely.HANNITY:  This insurgency year.  The game is changing here and we don't know how it's all going to play out.ELDER:  Absolutely, Sean.  And the big loser tonight, the big loser was not Donald Trump.  The big loser was Jeb Bush.  My god, how much money did he spend?  And he ended up getting 3 percent of the vote.  I mean, that's just pathetic.  HANNITY:  All right last word, Jessica.  TARLOV:  I agree about Jeb Bush being the big loser.  And I appreciate that you didn't say it was Hillary Clinton.  That's welcome. I think that, you know, Jeb Bush ...ELDER:  I didn't have enough time.HANNITY:  Hello. Do I get a vote here?TARLOV:  Yeah, what's your vote? Hillary Clinton is the big  loser?  HANNITY:  I think Hillary is the big  loser.  TARLOV:  How did I know you were going to say that?  HANNITY:  But if you can't beat a 73-year-old curmudgeon socialist who is at 3 percent of the vote ...ELDER:  74.  HANNITY:  Sorry, 74.  That's kind of pathetic, Jessica.TARLOV:  Listen, I'm with you.  I think that Hillary should be cleaning up on this.  I think, you know, also, we saw huge numbers of people in Iowa identifying as socialists.  HANNITY:  And her, she seems -- she was also ...TARLOV:  It's just not the way the rest of the country.  ELDER:  Right.  TARLOV:  I mean, I don't know.  Bernie Sanders ...HANNITY:  ... was unlistenable.  TARLOV:   Well, no, we all listened.  It was listenable.  I mean, it's not your thing.  She's not your thing.  I mean, you're waiting with open arms for an indictment.  So, you know, you're not the best arbiter of Hillary Clinton judgment there.  But as a Democratic and Hillary supporter.  HANNITY:  I can spot a candidate when i see one.  I've got to go.  TARLOV:  OK, well, I like her.  ELDER:  .... more people in Iowa.  HANNITY:  Yeah, I got to go, guys.ELDER:  More people in Iowa identify with socialism than capitalism, scary.  TARLOV:  Well, then it's only Iowa.  It's not the whole country.  HANNITY:  We're going to have more reaction to the big political news out of Iowa.  Pat Caddell, Katie Pavlich will weigh in next as we continue(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  Welcome back to HANNITY.  And here with us to break down the results out of Iowa, Fox News contributors Pat Caddell and Katie Pavlich.  All right Katie, your take, three-man race on the Republican side and Hillary big loser on Democratic side?  KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Actually it's a four-man race Sean from this point out because you look at New Hampshire and John Kasich actually does have a groundswell in that state.  So, we're going into New Hampshire soon.  There's still a lot of work to do, although Ted Cruz was victorious tonight.  We have to keep in mind that Iowa is not necessarily a determinant of what we're going see in the future.  But on the Hillary Clinton side, look, she's in big trouble, Sean.  I mean, this is her second time around in Iowa. She's barely going to squeak out a win possibly, it's still too close to call.  And here we are with her panicking about not being able to beat Bernie Sanders in the state where she was supposed to have all the structure in place, all the voters coming out for her, she's going to lose New Hampshire.  And then she's going to be going in to the southern states with two losses already on the board.  I mean, it's a real problem for her when the general election comes around.  HANNITY:  Let me ask you this.  If Kasich is in fact surging as you say and some polls have shown him in double digits, does that then cause a problem for Marco Rubio coming out of Iowa with good numbers in terms of the establishment vote?  PAVLICH:  I think it probably does because Marco Rubio has been selling himself as someone who can bring the party together.  And he has to compete for those, you know, so-called establishment votes in New Hampshire.  However, I think because of his good showing tonight, I think because of his acceptance speech, I think people are probably going to take a second look at Marco Rubio.  And actually, Marco Rubio could pose a threat to John Kasich's surge in that state so.  HANNITY:  Pat, let's get you to weigh in. Your thoughts on tonight.PAT CADDELL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  My first thought for the night, first of all, this as you said earlier, this was a big victory for the insurgents, both from the Republican Party and the Democratic Party.  And there is chaos everywhere.  Secondly, we learned something.  And by the way, I think Hillary has lost the real popular vote.  The Democratic Party here has the numbers.  They will not release them.  No one cares what less than 1 percent of the Democratic delegates are.  They want to know who won the popular vote.  And I believe he beat her, if he doesn't actually and the delegates' votes out.But having said that, let me go to the Republicans.  Cruz's ground game was everything it was said to be.  And Rubio and Trump skipping the debate, it was clear that Rubio having a platform to stand out, got a lot of the late deciders moving in his direction.  Trump I believe - let me tell you what I believe happened to Trump, other than his being too negative.  He has moved away from his message.  I will now tell you what I believe will happen in New Hampshire and that is for many experiences of Iowa and New Hampshire.  In 2008, Barrack Obama was said after Iowa, he was going to beat - win New Hampshire and be the automatic nominee.  New Hampshire reacted saying, ""We're not sure we want to make that decision and went to Hillary.""  Trump suffered here because I believe the press said everywhere, ""He's going to win Iowa then he'll run the tables.  He will be the nominee.  And a lot of voters here aren't sure they want that to happen.  But I do think then what happens in New Hampshire, Trump will slaughter the field.  He'll slaughter the field.  We'll see what comes out of the establishment lane and then we will go to a bloodbath in South Carolina.   He needs his message back.  HANNITY:  All right.  PAVLICH:  Yeah, we'll see if the voters turn out.  They've got to go to the polls.  HANNITY:  Yeah, all right guys.  Great analysis, appreciate it.  CADDELL:  They voted tonight. They voted tonight.HANNITY: Coming up, we've got more in ""Hannity"" right after this quick break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  All right, that's all the time we have left this evening.  As always, thank you for being with us.  Quick programming note, tune in tomorrow night 10 Eastern.  The winner of the Iowa Republican caucus, Senator Ted Cruz will be with us.
