This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST, ""THE KELLY FILE"":  Breaking tonight.  High stakes in the 2016 race for two White House, as the candidates prepare for a marathon of campaign events over the next 96 hours, with hundreds of delegates and potentially the future of the Republican Party on the line.  Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone.  I'm Megyn.  Back in New York, after last night's big debate in Detroit where the folks could not have been more welcoming.  With just four Republicans left in the fight for the GOP nomination, Donald Trump is looking to extend his winning streak, while the rest of the field looks to derail him.  The first big test comes less than 12 hours from now when polls open in Louisiana's primary.  Three other states, Kansas, Kentucky, and Maine, will also hold caucuses tomorrow.  In all, 155 delegates are at stake.  That's a lot given how many have already been allotted.  Meantime, Trump is making headlines for two other reasons tonight.  First, for changing his stance when it comes to torture.  Second, for deciding to cancel a scheduled appearance at the nation's largest annual gathering of conservative activists, CPAC in a move that surprise some supporters.  In moments, we will talk about that CPAC Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Chris Stirewalt and AB Stoddard are also here on what is at stake on tomorrow's primaries and caucuses.  Tonight, however, we begin with our Chief Political Correspondent Campaign Carl Cameron who is reporting from Detroit.  Carl.CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Megyn.  No rest for the weary, even in spite of last night's brawl, the candidates are fanned that all over the country because it's going to be a busy four days in terms of the race for more convention delegates.  Nine states will be voting, and there's a total of 328 delegates up for grabs between tomorrow and straight through Tuesday night.  Tomorrow, voting will be the Louisiana primary, and there will be caucuses in Kansas, as well as in Kentucky, and in Maine.  And Ted Cruz is in Maine today and Marco Rubio was in Kansas.  On Sunday, Puerto Rico holds its contest and Marco Rubio plans to go down to the territory to do some campaigning at the last minute.  And then come Tuesday, Hawaii, Mississippi, Idaho and Michigan.  And Michigan is the major prize, it's got 59 delegates.  And of course, it is a major industrial swing state.  John Kasich is looking to do particularly well here, because he's sort of looking at it as a steppingstone to Ohio, his home state.  A must-win and winner take all that takes place on the 15th, a week from Tuesday.  And both he and Marco Rubio have been competing very aggressively for Michigan.  But so is Donald Trump.  And Trump leads in most of the polls in these nine states and is likely to come out with the majority of the delegates.  And once again, the question will be, how close will Cruz and Rubio come both to one another and to stopping Trump?  Despite all the efforts to stop Trump, the never Trump movement, there was that pledge last night in the debate in which they said that they would support the front-runner even if it's Trump and Trump said he would not run a third party candidate if it is in him -- Megyn.  KELLY:  Carl, thank you.  Joining me now Chris Stirewalt, our Fox News digital politics editor.  And A.B. Stoddard, associate editor for The Hill.  Great to see you both.  All right, Stirewalt.  So, you know, we've been so focused on this big contest, Super Tuesday, Super Tuesday II, even Michigan.  What's happening tomorrow, that's a lot of delegates?  Trump has got about 300.  Cruz has got in the 200s.  Rubio has got around 100.  Now you're talking 155 delegates.  This could have a real impact.  CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR:  Well, not only does it have an impact in terms of what is promising to be a long, grinding grind to get to the requisite number, to get a majority of delegates to win outright for Donald Trump or conversely for the rest of them to try to stop him, it really is a numbers game.  But it's also a time of testing, the enormous conflagration of a trash pile that we saw on the stage from the Republican candidates in the face of some very expert questioning from some people is a demonstration.  The party is pulling its hair out and freaking out.  Is it changing?  Are Republicans changing their mind?  Are things going to be different?  Is Donald Trump in trouble?  Are the rest of them going to fall away?  We have no idea.  And this is our first test after that enormous debate to see where things are going.  KELLY:  Especially because these states are closed, right?  They're closed primaries and caucuses.  So, it's only going to be Republicans voting.  STIREWALT:  That's right.  And Donald Trump will not be able to bring in his army of Democrats and Independents who we have seen coming in to the early contest.  KELLY:  But he's also been winning in these states with conservatives, Chris.  STIREWALT:  This is the thing, this is the catch 22 for Trump.  You want to go to CPAC, especially when you're under fire about foreign guest worker visas and other things and conservatives have a beef with him, because he really is running more of a populist campaign, eccentric populist campaign than he is as a conservative.  So you skip out on the big conservative gathering.  You miss those folks, but he needs to be on the ground.  He needs to be in Kansas.  Because he could lose out there.  He needs to be on the ground in Michigan, because he could lose there, too.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.STIREWALT:  Kentucky is challenging, too.  So he needs to be out there dealing with those voters.  And if that means snubbing these conservatives, so be it.  KELLY:  So be it.  A.B., it was remarkable to see Trump's reversals today, because he does not, you know, he's not a big fan of admitting when he's wrong.  But he did it on two things today.  He reversed himself on two things that he positioned he had taken just last night's debate.  A.B. STODDARD, THE HILL ASSOCIATE EDITOR:  It's really remarkable.  First of all, great questions last night.  It was a great debate in terms of what was asked of the candidates.  But imagine that he reverses on two things.  I mean, fewer than 24 hours later?  Especially things that he's dug in on, like generals will just listen to my orders even if, you know, it defies American law.  And this is a really interesting moment in the contests where you're going to look at people, obviously his supporters who decided a long time ago in Kentucky, in Maine, in Idaho, Puerto Rico, they are not swayed if Donald Trump has a bad debate night.  I've watched these focus groups.  They are never swayed if he flips on positions.  But there are people that break late, and they've been deciding against Trump, largely for Rubio and for Cruz.  Sometimes for Kasich.  And so Donald Trump is going to be watching those margins tomorrow night to see if his debates and his, you know, switch positions on H-1B visas and on torture, on targeting the families of terrorists.  All these issues are going to have an effect on those numbers.  He wants wide margins.  He doesn't want tight contests.  And of course, Rubio will be looking to survive in places like Idaho, Puerto Rico and Kansas.  Cruz will be doing well in caucuses where he's very well-organized, places like Kansas sit border Oklahoma where he won.  So, Donald Trump got a little nervous.  And I think Chris is right.  That's why he blew off CPAC at the last minute, because he hasn't spent any time in Kansas.  And it was time to do it the day before the voting started.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.  Great to see you both.  STODDARD:  Thank you.  STIREWALT:  You bet.  KELLY:  So there were these two reversals which we'll get into.  But basically on Trump's website, he had spoken out against these foreign worker visas, this visas for highly skilled foreign workers coming in, taking American jobs.  So that's why he said no.  Then at a prior debate, he said, actually, I'm in favor of it, I think we should get more of these talented people in even if they're foreigners.  And then last night, he stood by that position, bringing more workers in.  And then today he went back to what the website says.  And we'll get into what he says on torture in just a bit with a military panel.  So the Republican frontrunner Donald Trump had a 7:00 p.m. rally in Louisiana.  He's now scheduled to be on his way to Kansas tonight ahead of that state's primary.  He wants to win there, but Trump was originally supposed to travel to the Conservative Political Action Conference, CPAC as it's known to give a big speech at the event tomorrow morning.  His team today announced, quote, ""The Donald J. Trump for President Campaign has just announced it will be in Wichita, Kansas for a major rally.  Because of this, he will not be able to speak at CPAC, as he has done for many consecutive years.""Trump's 11th hour decision appear to take a number of people by surprise and we have the group's chairman with us tonight.  Matt Schlapp. Matt, good to see you.  So, what is your reaction to Mr. Trump not coming?MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, CPAC:  Look, we're incredibly disappointed.  I think it's a big political mistake.  If you come from a state, if you don't come from Iowa or New Hampshire or South Carolina or one of these early states and you're filling this room as it's been filled for the last two years, two days and it will be filled tomorrow with conservative activists from all over the country, there's an expectation that if you want to have the Reagan mantle, if you want to call yourself a conservative candidate, you'll be here.  I don't think he skipped to CPAC because he's worried about these states, although it sounds like, of course, he should be worried about every state going forward.  I think he skipped CPAC because he wanted to dictate to us what the rules would be for his appearance.  And we decided that would not be appropriate, that we should treat every candidate and every campaign fairly and the same.  And that's what we have decided to do.  KELLY:  How so?  How did he try to do that?SCHLAPP:  You know, I think they figured that since they're the leading candidate, they should be able to come and speak for as long as they want to speak, but not have to answer questions.  And Megyn, one of the things that we changed about CPAC, is that if you're going to come to conservatives and give them your pitch on why you should lead them, you also need to take their questions.  And they didn't want to do that.  And so we decided that we would not change our rules for them, even though he's the front-runner.  I think it's a big mistake for him not be here.  I think it was a political whiff.  KELLY:  OK.  But in his defense, he apparently gave an interview last night to Sean Hannity, and Hannity is at CPAC as he is every year.SCHLAPP:  He sure is.  Right.KELLY:  And there was a negative crowd reaction when Trump popped up.  Let's just watch it.  Here it is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST:  And joining us now with reaction, 2016 Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump is with us.  Mr. Trump, good to see you.  How are you?  (CROWD CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(CROWD BOOING)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Thank you, Sean.  I'm great.  Thank you.  Thank you.  HANNITY:  All right.  We got half the crowd with you.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  So, you could see, I mean, does he have a right to pause about going into that environment where at least from that clip, it might not have been that welcoming.SCHLAPP:  No.  Sorry, Jeb Bush came here last year.  He did it under tough circumstances.  John Kasich came here.  Not everybody's favorite on the right.  He got a standing ovation.  Part of politics Megyn is coming and showing respect.  And if a candidate wants to be the conservative candidate, they have to come to CPAC.  It's the largest convention for conservatism of the year.  And to skip out of it, if you're right or other people are right, he skip out of it because he got a few hecklers or a few boos --  KELLY:  Well, not so much the boos.  Not so much.  But just, is this worth my time?  I want to win Kansas.  I can have a rally with thousands of people there.  He's given, what, $150,000 to CPAC, $100,000 I think last year, he's giving money to the cause.  So, his calculation is I don't have to win this state.   SCHLAPP:  Look, this has nothing to do with money.  We didn't approach any presidential candidates to contribute to CPAC, because we wanted to be fair with all the candidates.  We haven't chosen sides.  But the fact is it's this, it is a big mistake not to be here.  Ronald Reagan came here 13 times.  Ronald Reagan started his national career at CPAC.  Ronald Reagan gave his first address after becoming the president at CPAC.  Every person who wants to claim that mantle should be here.  And there's no excuse not to.  KELLY:  Matt, it's great to see you.  Thanks for being here.  SCHLAPP:  Thanks, Megyn.  KELLY:  We'll be watching.  Well, Donald Trump also did some damage control today after last night he told the country this is one of the flips that we were talking about, that our military would do what he told them to do as commander-in-chief, even if that command violated the law and the constitution.  That caused quite a stir and Mr. Trump reversed himself on that today.  It had been a position he had taken for months in his campaign, so the reversal made a lot of news.  Coming up, a combat that Pete Hegseth and Carl Higbie are there on that.  Plus, after john Kasich got high marks from some debate watchers last night, we sent him into a one on one with our Frank Luntz Focus Group.  We will show you what we learned from that matchup just ahead.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KASICH:  See, it's not worth winning if you can't deliver on what you're saying.  And it's not worth winning if all you want to do is spew red meat.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  They then came to me, what do you think of water boarding?  I said it's fine.  And if we want to go stronger, I would go stronger, too.  Because frankly, that's the way I feel.  (APPLAUSE)Can you imagine, can you imagine, these people, these animals over in the Middle East, that chop off heads sitting around talking and seeing that we're having a hard problem with waterboarding?  We should go for waterboarding and we should go tougher than waterboarding.  BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST:  But targeting terrorist families?TRUMP:  I'm a leader.  I've always been a leader.  I've never had any problem leading people.  If I say do it, they're going to do it.  That's what leadership is all about.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  That was Donald Trump last night insisting that if he becomes president and commander-in-chief and orders our military to waterboard terrorists or kill their families, they will do it, even though to do so would be illegal.  Then today we started to see serious pushback from some members of both the intelligence and military communities.  And Mr. Trump reversed himself on a long-held position.  In moments, we'll hear from combat veterans Pete Hegseth and Carl Higbie on this issue.  But first Trace Gallagher reports on what Trump's team is saying now.  Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And Megyn, since at least early December, Donald Trump has said when it comes to terrorist suspects he would do, quote, ""a hell of a lot more than waterboarding,"" telling FOX News that authorizing the military to kill family members of terrorists was a necessary deterrent and telling ABC News that perhaps he would also chop off heads.  Despite being reminded that his orders could result in war crimes charges against military members, their superiors and the U.S. government, Trump has maintained his position.  Former CIA Director Michael Hayden told Bill Maher the military would simply refuse Trump's order.  Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN, FORMER CIA AND NSA INSPECTOR:  You cannot -- you are not committed, you are not required, in fact you're required not to follow an unlawful order.  That would be in violation of all the international laws of armed conflict.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER:  Experts say, the I was only following orders defense has been rejected since Nuremberg.  But during last night's debate, Donald Trump's indicated the military would do as he tells them.  Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  They won't refuse.  They're not going to refuse me.  Believe me.  If I say do it, they'll going to do it.  That's what leadership is all about.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER:  Trump has insisted for months he won't back down.  Now he's backing down, saying in part, quoting here, ""I will not order a military officer to disobey the law.  It is clear that as president, I would be bound by laws just like all Americans and I will met those responsibilities.""  The ranking Democrat on the House Intel Committee Adam Schiff now wants Trump to disavow torture all together -- Megyn.  KELLY:  Trace, thanks.  Joining me now Pete Hegseth, an Afghanistan and Iraq war veteran, also a Fox News contributor.  And Carl Higbie, a former navy S.E.A.L.  Good to see you both.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you.KELLY:  And so, why, Pete, do you think we saw the reversal today, even though Mr. Trump's held this position for months now?PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I'm glad he reversed it, but it's typical Trump.  All bluster, very little substance.  He talks a tough game, but then when pressed on it, he's an armchair tough guy.  I hate to say it.  But this is a guy who said that John McCain is not a war hero, yet he sought his own five military deferments.  Because he says big blustery things that people want to hear after seven years of mom jeans from Barack Obama who refuses to fight the enemy and frankly has restrictive rules of engagement that hurt our men and women on the battlefield.  But he goes way too far and then when the military says we won't follow illegal orders, like torture or killing families, which is not loosening the rules of engagement, he suddenly realizes wait, I might actually be commander-in-chief.  And the problem here is, is that voters don't know whether you get the bluster Trump, which is the armchair tough guy, or you get the one who walks it back on a statement now and says, no, no, no, I'll follow the wall.  KELLY:  You know, General Michael Hayden, who ran the NSA and the CIA came out and said, this is a dangerous position.  He's not a Trump supporter.  He said this is dangerous.  And, you know, for him to have been hold this position for months that he's going to command our troops as commander-in-chief to go out there and violate the law is just unacceptable.  Your thoughts?Well, I think Trump made it very clear that he wasn't going to violate the law.  And I think as he understands --  KELLY:  No.  But the point is, up until last night -- last night on that debate stage he said he was.  Right.  And you're talking about what's dangerous -- what's dangerous is fighting a war with our hands tied behind our backs where our enemy can chop off your head, send it home in a box, but our troops on the ground can fight with their hands tied behind their back.  I mean, what's dangerous right now is the fact that we're fighting an enemy with diplomatic principles that just aren't conducive to winning a war.  That is what's dangerous.  KELLY:  You know, the critics say, OK, so under Barack Obama we're over here, you know, the rules of engagements is stifling and the troops can't -- they have to fight with one hand tied behind their back, is the answer really to go over here?  You know, completely the opposite way, past the point where we're obeying the laws but we're fighting aggressively, Carl?CARL HIGBIE, TRUMP SUPPORTER:  But what we need is a leader like Donald Trump to change the laws and I think that's what he is coming around here right now --KELLY:  We can't change the Geneva Convention.  Donald Trump is not going to be changing the Geneva Convention.  HIGBIE:  I think a true leader can definitely lobby for it.  And I think he's going to lobby on behalf --  KELLY:  Carl?HIGBIE:  Megyn, our troops are coming home in body bags right now.  KELLY:  Don't talk nonsense.  Let's keep it real.  Let's keep it in a real debate.  And we can defend Donald Trump's, you know, pro-military positions.  But you can't defend -- Pete, you tell me, is there any chance in -- on God's green earth of Trump getting in there and changing the Geneva Convention?HIGBIE:  No.  But he can get lawyers out of the way.  But I'll tell you, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and others have said, they'll get rid of the lawyers, too.  Here's the problem with Trump, he says, go ahead and kill the families.  Go ahead and torture.  Go ahead and go further than waterboarding.  What happens when people follow those orders or don't follow them?  It's not clear that Donald Trump will have their back.  Donald Trump is oftentimes about Donald Trump.  And so if you're not changing the law and you're just saying it, you create even more ambiguity.  KELLY:  Well, even if he had their back, they would be in trouble.  I mean, you tell me, I had a dad stop me in an airport this morning Carl, and say, my son is going to West Point next year, he's 17-years-old.  And they asked him during the interview if you're given an order you know to be illegal, do you follow it.  And he said even my 17-year-old knew the answer had to be, no, I will not, because your duty is to the country and to the constitution and to uphold the law even if you're given an illegal order.  And his point to me was, how can my 17-year-old know that and the man who wants to be commander-in-chief not?HIGBIE:  So, what I think -- what I think Trump is meaning by this, is he's not going to commit to a foreign war -- you've heard her talking out about Iraq.  He's not going to commit to a foreign war unless we have the ability to go in there and actually fight to sort of win.  Because if you're unwilling to be as ruthless as your enemy, you've already lost.  KELLY:  What about American ideals?  I mean, we don't chop off the heads of our enemy.  We don't murder their families.  I mean, what the other side is saying, Pete is, we don't sacrifice who we are as a country just because we are at war as ugly as war is.  HEGSETH:  You don't have to sacrifice who you are in order to prosecute a war ruthlessly.  This is where Carl is right.  We have tied our hands.  We aren't willing to viciously eliminate the enemy.  And Carl is one of those brave warriors who has done that and frankly face criticism for it.  We need a commander-in-chief that will back them up.  But that you can go too far with that and put your warriors in a place where they're compromising their own principles which has never what America has been about.  So you can go after them viciously attack them and find them where they are, and do what we need to do to defeat our enemies.  What Donald Trump is doing here, though, creates more complications I think on the back end for a lot of our folks.  KELLY:  Just to be clear again, it was in Trace's report, but Trump's statement today is that he does understand the U.S. is bound by laws and treaties, he won't order the military or other officials to violate the laws.  He will not order a military officer to disobey the law.  Great to see you, guys, both.  HEGSETH:  Thanks, Megyn.HIGBIE:  Thank you, Megyn.KELLY:  Well, just ahead.  New behind the scenes video from the 2016 presidential race when Mark McKinnon joins us with his insiders take on what his cameras captured on the campaign trail this past week.Plus, hot off strong reviews from the FOX debate.  Ohio Governor and Republican presidential candidate John Kasich went one on one with the Michigan voters and we were there.  We'll show you how he did, right after this break.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER:  Governor, how are you?  How many people walked in here supporting john Kasich, raise your hands.  Three people.  How many of you thought he won the debate?  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KASICH:  I can get the crossover votes.  You see, because throughout this campaign, I've talked about issues.  I have never tried to go and get into these kind of scrums that we're seeing here on the stage, and people say everywhere I go, you seem to be the adult on the stage.  (APPLAUSE)In terms of --  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  That was Governor John Kasich last night at the Fox News GOP debate, painting himself as the only adult on the stage as you heard.  We wanted to know if the voters agreed with that, so we invited the Governor to join pollster Frank Luntz and his Focus Group right after the debate to answer their questions.  Watch this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LUNTZ:  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to introduce the man who you said won the debate tonight, Governor John Kasich of the state of Ohio.  (APPLAUSE)Governor, how are you?  How many people walked in here supporting John Kasich, raise your hands.  Three people.  How many of you thought he won the debate.  Overwhelming.  Governor, what do you want them to know about your campaign or what you're about that you weren't able to tell them this evening?  Go ahead.GOV. JOHN KASICH, R-OHIO, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Well, I can fix the problems in Washington, you know, balancing budgets, cutting taxes, fixing the regulations, getting the country straightened up.  But what I really wanted you to know is I want to shift a lot of power back to where you live, and you know what I want you to do?  I want you to revive the spirit of our country by fixing things where you live.  Don't wait for somebody to come in and solve all the problems.  We got to fix our schools, keep our kids away from drugs, and I'll tell you another thing.  It's like that lady who was married for 52 years.  Her husband died.  Nobody takes her to dinner.  Call her up.  She'll get her hair done on Thursday and when you pick her up on Saturday, she'll have a dress on she hasn't worn in six months.  I mean, we need to pull ourselves together.  Our families, our communities, our neighborhoods.  I'll take care of Washington.  You just take care of this.  OK.  If I run into trouble, I'll give you a call.  LUNTZ:  What do you think?  Is that what you're looking for?(APPLAUSE)So here's your opportunity, what questions do you have?  Go ahead in the back.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think a lot of us really fell in love with you, but we're being told that you don't have a chance.  So, how do we get you a chance?KASICH:  Well, I mean, the key is that, we have to have a decent showing here.  And then when we win Ohio, it's going to be a whole new ball game.  And it's sort of funny, I need to get a little springboard out of Michigan into Ohio.  And if I can win in Ohio, then we're going to -- I'm going to emerge even more.  See, the problem has been, I'm not willing to get down in the gutter.  And so I don't say incendiary things to get elected, okay.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Reaction?KASICH: No, I won't do it, but you see, you know what the problem is, if you don't say incendiary things then you don't get on television. So here's what's really amazing. You think about this. I was one percent in the polls all the way to New Hampshire. People had counted me out. They said I couldn't win. We raised money. We spent it so carefully. I finished second in New Hampshire.That's the first time you saw me. Then I go down south and they ignore me again. They ignored me the whole time, because I'm not saying incendiary things and fighting with somebody. And you know what, I'm not going to do that. If I lose that's life, okay. Sometimes you get a vote not just with your head but with your heart.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You walked in her supporting who? What special about him to you?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You have a plan, you have experience. I lived in Ohio. I love Ohio. It's a great place second to Michigan. And you know, you've done a lot there. I was around in voting when you were in Congress and when you worked with Newt Gingrich and when you knew Ronald Reagan, which was the first president I ever voted for. So, I mean, you speak my language and you did those things that I thought they were great and I think that's exactly what our country needs now.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have a bias which is I always go to the youngest person in the room. You're 18 years old so this is going to be your first presidential vote.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What would you ask Governor Kasich?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do you plan to motivate the young people to get out in numbers like you see other candidates do?KASICH: Well because, see, my message to you is you're made special. There's nobody ever been -- nobody has ever been born or has ever been like you and no one who will come after you will be like you. So the question is, what do you want to do to change the world? Because that's what you have to believe in and look, what I want to do is make sure you have the power, you can get a job.I want to make sure that we get the job growth, the wages up and all that, and we can do that because I know how to get it done working with democrats and the fact is, you have to be Americans before we're -- a member of a political party -- but for you, if I can convince you that you can change the world by living a life  bigger than yourself, you'll get fired up and excite, don't you think.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Governor, the problem is when you mentioned the word Democrat, you know that's red meat for so many republicans. It doesn't bother you?KASICH: Well, it doesn't bother me because we have to get these things done. We're not going to fix social security with just one party. We're not a parliamentary system. I mean, we don't have to agree with people that don't think the way we do all the time but once in a while if they want to help us to build a house, we invite them over.And look, see, it's not worth winning if you can't deliver on what you're saying. And it's not worth winning if all you want to do is stew red meat. Look, we're down to four and I'm standing. I'm the last governor, okay. I mean, it's been fine and I get a win by raising the bar not by lowering it and I want to tell you, if you want to beat Donald Trump, you're not going to beat him by insulting him.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You guys agree?KASICH: The way you beat him is have the bigger vision. Have a bigger vision.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: GO ahead.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Governor, my question is you mentioned earlier that you didn't want to have the incendiary thing, you didn't want to get down the gutter but my concern is that when it comes to general election, if you are that candidate that you will not go negative, and I feel that prior to elections, they did -- there weren't negative enough against ...(CROSSTALK)KASICH: I want to answer real quick, first of all, I beat an incumbent in my very first election. I was the only republican to defeat an incumbent congressman in 1982 running in Reagan. I was the first one to defeat an incumbent governor in Ohio in 36 years. I have never run statewide. For somebody who has never run statewide, it was 96 years. And for my re-election, I won 86 out of 88 counties, 60 percent of women, 51 percent of union households and 26 percent of African-Americans.Don't you think that I'm not tough. I mean I come from the keys rocks. If you brought your football team in and you beat us, we'd break every window on your bus. So don't worry about, but you know the other thing is, I'm beating Hillary by 11 points. You know why? Because those democrats who Reagan got like me. And the independents like me. You know why? Because I'm not showing my teeth all the time.I'm trying to bring people together and there is something deep inside of us that would like to see some solutions today in this country. So don't worry about my toughness. You don't want to get in a fight with me.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ladies and gentlemen, Governor John Kasich.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Well, we've got some exclusive new behind the scenes footage from a Showtime documentary series on the 2016 presidential race. And wait until you see what some of the cameras captured that you did not see from the candidates on screen, when Marc McKinnon joins us next.Plus, there were new shots fired today in the fierce battle between Donald Trump and Governor Mitt Romney. Former top Romney adviser Stu Stevens is here on that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I backed Mitt Romney. I backed him. You can see how loyal he is. He was begging for my endorsement. I could have said Mitt, drop to your knees. He would have dropped to his knees. He was begging.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Trump, as you may have heard, the 2012 republican nominee for president Mitt Romney had some things to say about you. How do you answer Mitt Romney, sir?TRUMP: Well look, he was a failed candidate. He should have beaten President Obama very easy. He failed miserably and it was an embarrassment to everybody, including the Republican Party.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That was republican front-runner Donald Trump in the Fox News Debate last night, responding to harsh criticism yesterday from 2012 republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Hours earlier in the day yesterday, Romney labeled Trump a phony and fraud and yesterday Mr. Trump did not just hit back at Mr. Romney, he also went after one of our frequent guests and the man who is here tonight. Governor Romney's top 2012 campaign strategist. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: His campaign guy was terrible, terrible. He had a terrible campaign manager, who is always on television, Stuart Stevens or something. He's always on television knocking everybody. The guy ran one of the worst campaigns in the history of modern politics.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: In moments, we'll be joined by Stu Stevens along with Barry Bennett, who is an informal advisor to the Trump campaign. But first, the man under fire from Mr. Trump, Stuart Stevens is the former top campaign strategist for Governor Romney's 2012 presidential campaign and founding partner at Strategic Partners in Media. Sir, great to see you. So, let get --STUART STEVENS, FORMER CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST FOR MITT ROMNEY: Thank you.KELLY: -- we'll get to Mr. Trump and Romney and all that in one second. I want to get your reaction to last night's debate first.STEVENS: Listen, I thought it was a great night for Hillary Clinton and a disaster for republicans. Donald Trump has this unique ability to degrade everything he touches. For the first time, we saw someone out there as a presidential candidate defending his penis and attacking the constitution. That's going to attract voters? I mean, look, on Sunday he had to research the KKK.On Thursday, he's saying that he will indeed order the United States military to commit war crimes, because they'll do what he says. Now he walks it back. I mean, this is just someone who, every day shows in different ways why he's unfit to be president of the United States. And why he's not a conservative and doesn't believe in the constitution.KELLY: What did you -- what do you think was the purpose of what Mitt Romney did yesterday?STEVENS: Oh, I think it's clear. You have to stand up to Donald Trump, and you have to stand up for your principles. If you're just quiet now, when you have someone who is running for president of the United States, who clearly is out there threatening foundations of the country. I mean he's threatened the first amendment. He's threatened to make the United States military commit war crimes, and he just has no sense at all of what it is to be a conservative.KELLY: Do you -- is this about a Romney run, though? Do you think that Romney getting ready to run?STEVENS: No, no. I don't think so at all. And I think it's the idea of ...KELLY: Not even at a contested convention?STEVENS: I don't think so. This has never made sense to me, the idea that an outsider would come in, in a contested convention. It seems to me most likely, if one person doesn't have the 1237, that two other candidates would join -- who have been out on the race would join together on a second ballot in some sort of alliance, form a ticket, and win. You don't need the supporters of Donald Trump to do that.You would have to say, I think most likely a Kasich/Rubio ticket or a Cruz/Rubio ticket. I don't see them -- they've been out there now for a year plus running. I don't see that they're going to say, hey look, we've done this but we're going to bring in somebody else who hasn't. I don't think it's plausible.KELLY: Do you think if Donald Trump secures this nomination, that there will be a third party run, even if that would means giving Hillary Clinton essentially the White House?STEVENS: I think there'll absolutely be a third party running. I think it's essential that there is a third party run. Senator Sass has been very articulate on this. You have to have a conservative alternative. If Donald Trump is the nominee, there won't be for the first time in our lifetime. And the party has to stand for something other than election or it stands for nothing.So, I think without a doubt, there will be a strong third party run of a conservative candidate who believes in the constitution, who is not going to have to go out there and walk back things that he said about the first amendment or about the military, and that republicans can be proud of.KELLY: Stuart, good to see you.STEVENS: Good to see you.KELLY: Joining us with more Barry Bennett who was an informal advisor to the Trump campaign, had been with the Carson campaign before. Barry, good to see you. So you -- first of all, do you believe that that's possible, that the republicans or the conservatives as Stuart said would run a third party against Mr. Trump if he gets this nomination?BARRY BENNETT, INFORMAL ADVISOR TO TRUMP CAMPAIGN: Gosh, I hope not. I mean, I was excited to know that Stuart is a conservative, that's news. That's (inaudible). But I mean, listen, Marco Rubio has to win 66 percent of the delegates as we sit here tonight with the remaining delegates in order to get the nomination. That's not going to happen. And after tomorrow, if the polls stay the way they are, that number is like 73 but Monday it's 79, it's impossible.KELLY: The experts are saying, the people who we trust are saying the only way those guys really like, they can't win outright. They have to hope for a contested convention.BENNETT: Yeah, they're going to try to steal it, right. They've got to subvert the will of the people.KELLY: Well, the rules allow for a contested convention.BENNETT: Well, perhaps Donald Trump would get 49 instead of 50 and that will give him a chance. I mean, that's absurd. You know, you might as well strap on a vest and go into convention and blow it up. You'll kill the party. You'll kill -- I mean, there would be protests in Cleveland like we wouldn't believe. That's ridiculous. This is really, really stupid advice, whoever gave it to Mitt Romney.You know, Mitt Romney has never been a conservative leader. I mean, he was a great guy. He ran. It was a bad campaign, bad times, whatever you want to say, but I mean, this is really, really stupid advice.KELLY: What do you make of all the heat Trump is taking today for his reversals on foreign worker visa and the issue of how he would command our troops?BENNETT: Well, you know, it seems like on the troop thing, he actually did what he should have done and instead of everyone saying that's good, everyone wants to criticize him no matter what happens. There's always a criticism. But I mean, he's growing as a candidate. He's going to grow as a candidate as we go along. He's much better today than he was six months ago.But you know, there's been like 73 polls since July 9 or whenever he got in the race and Ben Carson led four of them and Ted Cruz led one them, and he's led every other single poll. It's a little late in February and March to launch this kind of attack.KELLY: I got to go quickly so I'm going to ask you, he's taking a lot of heat for the comment about his anatomy. Your thoughts on it?BENNETT: Well, I mean who brought it up, you know? The small hands joke --KELLY: Well, that's a debate.BENNETT: That was the intention, right.KELLY: Rubio brought it up on the campaign trail.BENNETT: Not unless they're talking about a pedicure, exactly.KELLY: Awkward.BENNETT: This is the problem. We're not talking about issues, right. We're talking about petty attacks. You are not going to get elected. You're not beat Donald Trump ...KELLY: Well, Donald Trump has made a lot of petty attacks too, you have to admit that.BENNETT: Oh yeah, I think the debates have been the disaster for the party, I agree with Stuart on that. Too many, we had some tough art (ph) and vicious. We're not talking about anything, but you know, goodness gracious. I don't want to talk of it on film.KELLY: On twitter, for that moment of the debate, all I saw was, OMG, OMG, OMG. Barry, it's great to see you. Hope to see you again soon.BENNETT: Thank you.KELLY: Up next, Mark McKinnen with an exclusive look at what his cameras captured behind the scenes on the 2016 presidential campaign this week. Here he is, next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Rubio really got under Trump's skin the last debate. He tried to do the same thing tonight, not as effectively.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What are some surprises for you about just staying on the campaign?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How disingenuous the whole process is.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Really?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean, you know, you know it is and I'm certainly not na<ve in terms of you know, what it is and we've done some pretty big deals all over the place so you know, we get how the world operates. But when I see some of the desperation in the other campaigns and trying to take something and turn it into something it's not and trying, you know -- frankly, sometimes just the outright lies, because it doesn't matter. You know, when you apologize it's like the retraction in a paper, right. Well, the retraction on page 30 two weeks later doesn't mean anything. You sort of make, you know, you get the win then and you move on and everyone forgets.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That was our next guest and Donald Trump Jr. In a new clip from the new documentary series ""The Circus."" The show goes behind the scenes of the 2016 presidential campaign. In this next clip, they take their cameras into a Trump campaign rally. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a kind of event that Trump's been doing all campaign and he's got the balls to do it, the mojo to do it, the people to do it. They laughed early on at the big events or they dismiss them is just curiosity but there's not anyone else in this race with the confidence to try to fill a place like this.(CHANTING)TRUMP: Build that wall. We're going to build that wall. Don't worry about it. And who's going to pay for that wall? Who?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining us now, Mark McKinnon, co-creator and co-host of the weekly documentary series ""The Circus"" on Showtime. Also, former chief media adviser to George W. Bush's presidential campaigns. Mark, great to see you.MARK MCKINNON, CO-CREATOR AND CO-HOST OF THE CIRCUS: Thanks. Good to see you.KELLY: And you say you cannot understand what's happening with the Donald Trump movement as he calls it without going to one of these rallies.MCKINNON: I was stunned when I went to a rally. I've been working in politics for 30 years. I've never seen anything close to it. I mean it's just a phenomenon. It's a movement. You see constituencies and people there who are passionate, they're excited and the sorts of people that you don't normally see at political rallies and it's not just angry old people.There are lots of young people. There's blue collar, hard labor types. You know, a lot of people who are normally democratic constituencies, so, it's from democratic so beware of what you asked for because he's going to build a different kind of coalition if he's the nominee.KELLY: And Bret Baier did a special where people were getting Donald Trump tattoos. I mean, what other candidate has people get his tattoo in their face often.MCKINNON: We have that in our last episode, we had a guy with a tattoo on his face.KELLY: I mean now that is commitment. That is not an unwavering voter.MCKINNON: And you know, two of the most interesting people that we've talked to during the series are James Sanders and Donald Trump Jr. He was engaging, interesting, articulate and he had just started to be a surrogate for his dad. It was his first and he was really good up there in Elko, Nevada and he was talking their language.KELLY: All of the kids are great representatives for Donald Trump.MCKINNON: It says a lot -- if you look at people's kids now, it says something about him.KELLY: Yeah, I got to go home and work on mine right now. No, they're good, they're good. So far so good. They're very little. What do you make of this of what Stewart Stevens was suggesting that the republicans will likely run a third party candidate if Trump gets the nomination?MCKINNON: I actually predicted this back in September 9th. I wrote a column for The Daily Beast. I said that the irony would be if you remember back last year, they were forcing Donald Trump to sign a pledge he won't do that. And I said, flash forward, it could be that he gets the nomination.  The republicans are put in a position of running their own independent candidate to sort of resurrect the new Republican Party and a message --KELLY: Do you think he is giving Hillary the White House?MCKINNON: I think those people think that that's going to happen anyway. So, why not go down with somebody else carrying a message that we believe?KELLY: They feel like they're going down on principle, like going down fighting. What did you make of the debate last night.MCKINNON: I got to watch it at CPAC, which was fantastic because it was like watching in a Roman coliseum. There were 3,000 rabid people who would just went crazy and they're yelling and screaming and so, they loved it. They loved it. It was great. And --KELLY: Do you feel like it moved the needle in any way?MCKINNON: I think in some ways, I mean, there was a lot of Cruz supporters there. It was a very conservative crowd, but everybody had their own faction. The thing that I felt like, I've talked to people afterwards, they felt like that the case is prosecuted a little further each week with each debate and that there are flesh wounds anyway.Now, whether or not they're sort of mortal wounds, maybe not but they're starting to build a stronger and stronger case and, you know, but maybe not in time and maybe just make it more vulnerable for the general election.KELLY: Donald Trump, as you know, has become the front-runner and is running away with this thing by a lot of accounts. He obviously comes under more and more scrutiny and one of the remarkable things has been how people haven't been doing it prior to now, a lot of people. In any event, it's been fascinating. Highly recommend ""The Circus"" in Showtime. Mark is behind it. He knows, what we're talking about. Great insider's view in the most fascinating election in history. We'll be right back. Thanks Mark.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Special event this Monday. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders sit down with our own Bret Baier in a town hall. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders almost never game (ph) to come over here to Fox News so this is big. Monday night, 6:00 p.m. eastern. Thanks for watching, everybody.

This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" October 20, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone, I'm Dana Perino along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Eric Bolling and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock -- now we're back in New York City and this is ""The Five.""We've got 19 days left, folks. All three presidential debates are in the history books. We've got a ton to break down on the final clash beginning with the biggest newsmaker of the night, this one.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR AND POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely, sir, that you will absolutely accept the result of this election?DONALD TRUMP, PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I will look at it at the time. I'm not looking at anything now. I will look at it at the time.WALLACE: One of the prides of this country is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner. Are you saying you are not prepared now to commit to that principle?TRUMP: What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense, OK?HILLARY CLINTON, PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Well, Chris - -(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: And that elicited a sharp and pointed response from his opponent.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: That's horrifying. You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is. It's rigged against him. He is denigrating, he's talking down our democracy. And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Trump's questioning on the integrity of our presidential election has been met with widespread criticism on both sides of the aisle. Today, he addressed the fallout and added some gasoline to the fire.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Ladies and gentlemen, I want to make a major announcement today. I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election if I win.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: So not content to leave that story to die. He added more to it. We will be talking about it a lot more. Eric, when he said that last night in the debate, did you immediately think, oh, there's your headline?ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: I did not because it had any substance to it, because I knew the right and the left were going to both grab on to that and say, look, look, what he is doing in advance if he -- he's kind of setting the groundwork that he is going to say it's a rigged election. With her long time we've said or I've said, I don't think this is a great strategy by him. I don't love this, but he is gonna go ahead to embrace it. I -- I still don't get it but nonetheless, he did. And I think that right there was -- he was just being tongue in cheek, if I win, ha, ha, ha. But you know, I just -- so let's talk about what that statement is. Is it that big? It looks now everyone is making a huge deal out of this. But why isn't that big? Why is it so important? OK, so he says, ""You know what? I -- maybe I will say it was rigged after if I don't win."" But this is a huge common place, a lot of people, a lot of groups. People have said the election was rigged, I was supposed to win; 2004, a great example, Ohio in 2006. It's been democrats doing it as well. And don't forget this is a guy who stood on the stage and said, ""Will you"" -- had people say, ""Will you support the eventual nominee and ended up being him?"" And all of them said, ""Yes, we will."" And not all of them have.PERINO: OK, I'm not sure how -- what's the relevance of that?BOLLING: That --PERINO: He's what?BOLLING: He has been burned by it and by -- even people of his own party .PERINO: By what?BOLLING: . in the past. So he is just saying, ""Hey, let's just wait and see what the results are."" He is not -- I mean, look. If he loses and then, you know, it's not going to be hanging chad situations, I can see he's OK. He lost, we'll move on.PERINO: All right. Juan, you want to respond to that? I just --JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, I think that he is selling distrust of the American political structure with people who are his ardent supporters. I mean the Trump supporters really believe Donald Trump. And he is now, sort of inculcate in this idea that, you know what, this American political structure is rigged against us. We will never get a fair shake. You go to vote and it won't be properly counted. So the result is, republican, republican campaign election officials are coming out saying, ""Donald Trump, stop. Don't do this. This is not right."" We, in fact, run the election system in so many counties and states and you are saying we're not to be trusted. So it goes beyond the moment. It goes beyond this election. It's the people losing faith in our democratic, democratic processes and in democracy itself as a result. And I think that's irresponsible. I mean, you know -- Hillary Clinton turned it into a joke. She said, ""Well, Donald says everything is rigged when he didn't win the Emmys."" And he's actually won it. I mean --PERINO: But that was pretty funny, although on his part.WILLIAMS: Yeah, but I mean, but it --PERINO: I thought.WILLIAMS: But we're talking about a real serious issue here. We're talking about, you know, the heart of this -- the heart of a political structure.PERINO: Well, speaking of serious issues, Kimberly .KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Yeah.PERINO: . the first of his 30 minutes, I thought, especially Chris Wallace, the moderator who has received widespread praise for his role last night, he really hit several substantive issues; guns, Supreme Court, immigration and abortion right away.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. Right away he got to the meat. And I think also it was very important because he set the tone for the evening like, listen, this is, you know, big boy time, big girl time. There is not going to be any messing around and he checked the audience, too. So I think everyone was like, wow, OK, this is going to be straightforward. And I think from there, it really lent itself to success for the night, and people got to listen and hear. I mean, I think Chris Wallace gave a master class in debate moderating. I've thought he was fantastic and brought the best out in terms of both of the candidates, making them both look, you know, presidential in terms of answering the questions. So it was great. I liked it a lot.PERINO: What did you think from -- where, where do you guys watched it? Because you guys came home on the ""Red Eye"" last night.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: I watched it in my hotel room.PERINO: Oh, you did.GUTFELD: Yes, I did. I had the hotel robe on and I ordered myself a nice piece of meat. I thought Chris Wallace .GUILFOYLE: OK, Hannibal Lector.GUTFELD: . tried to achieve the impossible, which was to find the high road and quicksand. And I thought he did. I agree, I agree with Eric about this controversy. I mean, being surprised by that is -- you would be surprised by sunlight. That's vintage .GUILFOYLE: I know.GUTFELD: . Donald Trump. You know it, it's not a refusal. It's more like a natural outgrowth of his negotiation. It's like, I'm not going to -- everything is on the table for him. It's always going to be on the table. He's not going to tell people what he is doing. And he's entitled -- that's his, that's his shtick. I don't -- I don't think --it's weird. Every time a republican does something, it's horrifying. But you could find five or six examples of somebody on the left doing the same thing whether it's Black Live Matter or Occupy Wall Street or Senator Sanders, even Barack Obama talking about division, talking about the little guy being screwed. And that's considered majestic and romantic. You have somebody on the right who is doing it and at somehow, the whole democracy is under threat. Everything is going to be destroyed. I think he's just having -- that to me is harmless and kind of funny.BOLLING: Can I just throw a couple of examples out as well? 2000, Jesse Jackson said, ""We have to check the -- integrity of the system."" Salon in 2012, is the GOP stealing Ohio? 2000 New York magazine, ""Rolling Stone,"" two occasions, two years apart saying, ""Was the 2004, was the 2004 election stolen? Yes. Howard Dean actually said, ""The voting machines were not reliable"" -- and Fahrenheit 9/11. Juan, the left has been saying this exact same thing .WILLIAMS: You know --BOLLING: . that Donald Trump has said, ""Here's the last 16 or long years.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: There's such an important point to be made here Eric.BOLLING: Is after?WILLIAMS: Al Gore. Al Gore, after -- when he lost in a highly controversial election in our lifetime, something all of us at this table lived through, Al Gore said, you know what?BOLLING: When?WILLIAMS: When?BOLLING: Yeah.PERINO: Last day on the Supreme Court. But I think --GUILFOYLE: One --BOLLING: Yeah.PERINO: I think that there is --GUILFOYLE: One day after they went to the Supreme Court.WILLIAMS: They went to the Supreme Court and he said, you know what, even though -- and to this day you can hear it from some part that, in fact, democrats got more votes than republicans. Gore got more votes than Bush. But guess what? Gore cleared the way and acknowledged President Bush. What you are talking about, there are people who are not the candidate. Donald Trump is the candidate. That's my point to you.BOLLING: You mean he's not --WILLIAMS: He is not ""Rolling Stone"" or some other magazine.BOLLING: He simply said, ""Well, let's see what happens.""WILLIAMS: Jesse Jackson -- no.BOLLING: If the -- you know why --WILLIAMS: No.BOLLING: By the way, for the record .WILLIAMS: The only way -- no, the only way --BOLLING: I don't agree with voter fraud. I don't think it's going to make a difference in the election, but --WILLIAMS: Yeah, right. But the only way that you and Greg can be right on this point .BOLLING: Yeah.WILLIAMS: . is to say, oh, well, he thinks it's just like a TV reality show and you're saying, hey --GUILFOYLE: With the season finale.WILLIAMS: Yes. What's the teaser for next week? You never know what's coming.GUTFELD: That's fun how I looked at it.WILLIAMS: Or -- but that not what would that mean? That he really thinks he's already lost. That he's not playing to win this election anymore.GUTFELD: No.BOLLING: Man, are we over thinking -- a quick throwaway line.WILLIAMS: That was not a throwaway line.BOLLING: It's just felt like it to me.WILLIAMS: Chris Wallace gave him a chance to step out of the hole, because when he step in .BOLLING: Yeah.WILLIAMS: . Chris Wallace said, ""Hey, let me just be clear. In America's historical traditions, the losing candidate is always --BOLLING: It's right.WILLIAMS: It's like --BOLLING: So if --WILLIAMS: Mr. Trump, what do you say?BOLLING: If he does lose the electoral, Electoral College, like say around you margin of laws. Do you think Donald Trump was going to say, ""This was rigged and I didn't realize -- I should have won?""WILLIAMS: Yeah. That's his --PERINO: That's what he just said.BOLLING: Oh, I don't know if that's what he said.GUTFELD: You know what's worse, though?BOLLING: I'm not sure that's (inaudible).GUTFELD: He -- what's worse than what -- Trump did, OK? So Trump says that. But it's not necessarily a falsehood or anything. It's just a comment. Meanwhile, the thing that drives me crazy and -- I think the left has pioneered this, the anecdotal story about somebody that they talk to? President Obama, you can probably should that all the time, and she did it a couple of times yesterday.BOLLING: She was. Yeah.GUTFELD: And it's like, I just want somebody to go. What is this person's name? Where are they from? How long have you known them?GUILFOYLE: Like it's --GUTFELD: Because I don't believe you.PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: I don't believe this conversation ever took place.PERINO: Well, the woman --GUILFOYLE: Karla?PERINO: The young girl that he -- Karla is the woman that actually was the -- she was the little girl that she made the ad about. That --that actually was a real girl, and that was probably the most --GUTFELD: Are you sure Dana?PERINO: I don't know.GUTFELD: I don't know either.PERINO: I mean the thing is that -- as Charlie heard --GUTFELD: I wasn't talking about that one, by the way.PERINO: OK.GUTFELD: I was talking about a different one.PERINO: All right. Because you don't know who it is either?GUTFELD: I refuse to listen. I fell asleep.PERINO: All right, I've lost control --GUILFOYLE: From the steak.PERINO: Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Yes. Well, it's --PERINO: But --GUILFOYLE: Heavy in your stomach.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: So there might be some who think this is no big deal. But the fact is that headlines across all the papers that this is what everybody is talking about.GUILFOYLE: This was the lead.PERINO: So it leaves the structure of the race unchanged after last night's debate.GUILFOYLE: Right. And so you're talking about that instead of the other issues and the specific answers to the questions that Chris Wallace was absolutely, you know, actually able to nail them down on. So the lead today, which I heard 3 million times and read everywhere, was contesting the election. And you saw him getting criticized by the right, people in his own party criticized by the left. It felt a little bit like a squeeze play. I'm like -- let's talk about the other issues that happen and what their specific answers were on national security and on immigration and some of the other things that (inaudible).PERINO: But it gave them the rabbit to chase.BOLLING: It's -- of course. And that's the --PERINO: That's his fault.BOLLING: That's sad part. And that's why we have said for the last few days, this isn't a great debate or dialogue to be, to be having right now. You point out rightly; Supreme Court, second amendment, abortion and immigration right away in the first 30 minutes in the four topics. And Donald Trump drew a line and said, ""This is where we are on these policies, major policy issues."" Here is where she is and he nailed that. And then he went ahead with this thing. I just don't really get it. Maybe there's something on the back side of this. I don't understand. But you're right. So every paper and every deed is about this comment.GUILFOYLE: And it's good on foreign hot spots, too. Yeah.WILLIAMS: You know what? You are upset.BOLLING: Well, because I think there was an opportunity. I think -- yeah, there's --PERINO: Yeah. I mean you could see some .BOLLING: I think (inaudible) --PERINO: . Trump supporters last night, I watched some of the coverage, and they would say, ""I wish he would have said this. I wish he would have that."" And they come up with really great things that he could have said. But that's not what he said and this is the situation. And actually, you do have some republicans trying to defend him today using things like in 2000, but I think the big difference is Al Gore challenged Florida. Now Al Gore called and conceded to President Bush.WILLIAMS: Yes, it is.PERINO: Then when they flipped Florida back. He called President Bush back and said, ""I'm going to take back that concession."" And that started the recount. And what -- what Gore wanted to do was selectively choose counties from which to -- do the recount when Florida law said you have to do it all across .GUILFOYLE: All across.PERINO: . the state. And David Boies who was the attorney for Al Gore, actually, in his autobiography is very explicit that they were trying to harvest democratic votes in those counties. And that's why there was a big fight. That was after the election was held, not beforehand. And I think that's maybe the distinction.GUTFELD: Can I just -- one more compliment to Chris Wallace? He was like the -- I called him the nonsense fireman. Whenever there it seemed like it was going off-track or there's going to be a little bit of nonsense, he took out the Chris Wallace fire hose. They just put it out and then, and then, and then it just got back on the track. And I thought that's why you had a clear -- you could see a clear definition between the candidates, minus the fog of chaos and hysteria that we've seen for so long.BOLLING: And he did get acclaim from both sides.PERINO: Everywhere.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: Everywhere.GUILFOYLE: Instantly.GUTFELD: I think --GUILFOYLE: And from all the other of the anchors .GUTFELD: I think from now on it should have --GUILFOYLE: . in that network.GUTFELD: All the debates on Fox News --BOLLING: With Chris Wallace.PERINO: With Chris Wallace. Probably (inaudible)GUILFOYLE: I think we should add another one.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: All right. We got to run. We're going to run out of time. We've -- all seen the violence at some of the Trump rallies. The GOP nominee is blaming his opponent for riling up crowds on purpose. That fiery exchange from last night, we will have it next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: That's the final debate. The nominees sparred over who is responsible for inciting violence at some of Trump's rallies.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: If you look at what came out today on the clips, where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence. She's the one and Obama that caused the violence. They hired people. They paid them $1,500 and they're on tape saying, ""be violent; cause fights; do bad things.""CLINTON: He incites violence where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies and she caused the violence. It's on tape.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Trump was referring to an undercover tape by Project Veritas that exposed democratic operatives discussing plans to cause trouble at his events, including a man in Robert Creamer, a frequent visitor to President Obama's White House. Clinton came -- Clinton claims she knows nothing about it. And the head of the DNC tried her hardest to deny and deflect.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONNA BRAZILE, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIR: Look, when you have a convicted criminal sneaking around your office with imposters that try to - -MEGYN KELLY, THE KELLY FILE"" HOST: Are you referring to Bob Creamer the head of Democracy Partners?BRAZIL: No, I'm -- referring to Mr. O'Keefe, an instance that he has doctored some videos as he has done before.KELLY: You say that the tapes are .(CROSSTALK)KELLY: . falsified?BRAZILE: Mr. O'Keefe enjoys falsifying records. He did it with NPR. He did with (inaudible).KELLY: What about in this case?BRAZILE: Donald Trump made several ridiculous claims tonight.KELLY: You keep dodging. I --BRAZILE: And you --KELLY: I -- and I hit Donald Trump's .BRAZILE: . you say -- I'm not dodged out.KELLY: . representative with those. But now we have you.BRAZILE: I don't play dodge ball, honey. I play basketball. And I'm just telling you, he tried to score on misinformation. He is trying to score.KELLY: OK, but I have you. Listen, listen, you have --BRAZILE: On this information was obtained illegally.KELLY: You, you saved --(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right. So Dana, about a week ago, I think I mentioned that I called for Donna Brazile to step down as the DNC chair because of that e- mail that she sent forwarding the question to Hillary Clinton. I got a lot of pushback. But Megyn Kelly really honed in on that and -- didn't go out well for --PERINO: So that wasn't the part that just saw in -- that the interview that went on for a long time. Donna Brazile denies it, that she was going to come on ""The Kelly File"" and answer tough questions about it. What I think is -- whoever hired these people to go and incite violence for like -- human beings to confront other human beings, like the woman on the oxygen who got punched in the face and its planned out? I mean, I don't know if the tapes are edited or not. I take them at face value until we are proven otherwise, but that's just a terrible way to treat human beings. I have -- I would never agree to something like that.BOLLING: Juan, do you --GUTFELD: I can't hear you.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: What do you make of this? I mean, the defense is, and we're talking about the accusation that the democrats paid for protesters to incite violence at a Trump rally. I mean if that's true and (inaudible), it's horrible, right? And then the question is .WILLIAMS: Absolutely.BOLLING: . it's the only defense while those tapes might be doctored?WILLIAMS: No, no, no. I think there are a couple things to say here and I've said it to you before. One is, I don't -- I think that there was a combusted atmosphere. Trump rallies, I've seen anything wrong. Two, I think that you have people like young college kids in Chicago, the scene that we just saw where the young man was being taken-off the stage by the police. Those people, they're leftie activists, anarchists types and they get there and they, they maybe with move on or whatever, you know, Occupy Wall Street. And those people, I think, they're going to go there and they're going to start trouble and they're going to stop Trump from speaking. And in fact, that's what they did that night in Chicago, as I recall. The third things -- thing to say is, guess what? You know what? Donald Trump's foundation gave money to O'Keefe. And O'Keefe -- I don't know why anybody would think, hmm, there's a problem -- wouldn't think there's a problem with James O'Keefe and his record. He's had to pay lawsuit settlements. This is a guy that has been proven to have misled people who want to be his supporters on the right on issues like the abortion tape, the Planned Parenthood tapes.BOLLING: Well, so you --WILLIAMS: And I'm just saying --BOLLING: I think at the end saying that the defense is -- they may be doctored?WILLIAMS: We don't know.BOLLING: From that?WILLIAMS: We don't know. And he doesn't have a high level of credibility. That's all I'm saying.BOLLING: All right. So Greg, your thoughts on -- on all of this?GUTFELD: But this is --BOLLING: Of course.GUTFELD: This is again an example of how the right is catching up to the left. The left have had people like Michael Moore for ages. And violence is always OK on the left because your heart is in the right place. For example, if you remember the riots -- and the WTO riots. They made a movie out called -- ""A Battle in Seattle."" So as long as, you know, you have some kind of romantic -- I'm for the little guy, you can do any violence you want. The other rule is a corrupt republican always makes bigger news than a corrupt democrat, that (inaudible) makes his point that like, you know, Trump is known for the sex allegations. On Hillary, they are using plants to incite violence. If you reverse those two stories .PERINO: Yeah.GUTFELD: . and it was the Clintonians (ph) sexual allegations, people would make excuses for it, as they already have for Bill. And using plants to incite violence by Trump would be seen as the worst thing that could ever happen in the history of the world. So what the -- republicans are already in the hole, because for some reason, even the left expects better of us. Isn't that funny?BOLLING: What's the line?GUTFELD: They expect better from us.BOLLING: What's the line, if it bleeds it leads? Well, it's bleeding and it's not leading anywhere. What's leading is, you know, as Greg points out, Trump's sex allegations or he said something about contesting elections.GUILFOYLE: Well, I think this was a strong, powerful moment for Trump to bring it up. It looked like Hillary was in kind of shocked disbelief because he made a very -- like you know, strong claim accusing her and the White House, and she did -- well, that's what he did say. He did accuse them.WILLIAMS: No, but I was -- no, but I say --GUILFOYLE: And which was kind of like surprising to accuse and say the .WILLIAMS: Right.GUILFOYLE: . White House was directly involved and complicit in this. So that's a very bold statement to make during, you know, a debate like that when she was questioned later on her plane, she was like, have some food and drink, I can't get into every one of his conspiracy theories. So that's what we have. But I also think when somebody is accusing of something like that, I thought she should have said something back to defend or say that she had nothing, you know, to do with it. I didn't feel she's kind of -- maybe it was a strategy that she had in the debate prep, to not go and defend herself because he made some very strong allegations at her. And that was one of them, the kind of was left on the table.PERINO: Yeah, like what if, what if an e-mail surfaces that show --WILLIAMS: Right.PERINO: That later on, it looks like there is a tie to it.GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: Well --PERINO: She was trying to dodge it.GUILFOYLE: I think --WILLIAMS: I see that's what would --GUILFOYLE: I think that why they did on purpose.WILLIAMS: That's what I was going to say. So -- if there is a chain, and you can say Hillary Clinton's campaign was responsible for this, then you got a story. But right now, there is no story.BOLLING: But the DNC clearly, well --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: No, (inaudible).GUTFELD: Fire somebody.BOLLING: Yeah, but they --WILLIAMS: That's right.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: But isn't that admitting guilt?WILLIAMS: No.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: No, no.BOLLING: You fire someone you're, you're basically saying what's on the tapes must be real, right?WILLIAMS: No, you are reaching here. They're trying to just keep this at --BOLLING: Am I wrong?WILLIAMS: And I think if republicans, if weren't for that .GUILFOYLE: It's worth checking out.WILLIAMS: . I would hope that they would get in touch people.BOLLING: If you fired someone based on what was on that tape .PERINO: But you can set --BOLLING: . you can't be aren't sure what was on the tape.PERINO: Well, you can settle a lawsuit without admitting guilt. So I think you can fire somebody without admitting .BOLLING: All right.PERINO: . blame.BOLLING: We'll leave it right there. Last night Hillary tried to diffuse all those damaging revelations from the WikiLeaks dumps, but Trump wouldn't let them slide. That's coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The WikiLeaks just actually came at John Podesta said some horrible things about you. And boy was he right? He said some beauties. Podesta said you have terrible instincts. Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment. I agree with both.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Donald Trump taunting his rival with her words, words from her campaign chair as well. That's according to hacked e-mails released by WikiLeaks. Clinton tried to undo the damage caused to her campaign by shifting the focus to Russia and Vladimir Putin.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: What's really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans. Will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this? And make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in this election.TRUMP: I don't know Putin. He said nice things about me. If we got along well, that would be good.He has no respect for her.CLINTON: Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.TRUMP: No puppet. No puppet.CLINTON: And it's pretty clear...TRUMP: You're the puppet.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Puppet. We saw the puppet.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: On the show.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: But Greg...GUILFOYLE: Tremendous hair.WILLIAMS: ... I thought, in fact, that was a moment when Trump had Hillary on the ropes. And she, you know, pivots off the ropes, brings up Putin. And he goes in on Putin, and he's trying -- ends up trying to defend Putin, which I don't think is politically advantageous.GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: So at the end of this period, Chris Wallace says, ""Boy, we got a long ways away from anything that we were talking about here.""GUTFELD: Well, this is the dilemma. OK? We can legitimately nail Hillary for carelessly treating classified information. But how can you do that while championing actual espionage against your own government?The Russians are plotting to subvert an election to foment some kind of dissension. They're trying to do -- I don't believe it's a revolution. Perhaps it's revenge against our meddling in the Ukraine or elsewhere. And Putin's just exacting revenge.But the fact it, you go after her about her e-mails, but then you say, this is -- that WikiLeaks is OK. WikiLeaks is espionage. It's allowing another government to undermine our government.Interpol just arrested another Russian link to the hacking scheme here. We know Podesta fell for a phishing scheme where he opened a link that looked like a Gmail -- a Gmail account. And that's how they got him. And that's how they ended up getting your phone number, Juan, which I've been answering every day.WILLIAMS: Apparently, a lot of people want to talk to me.GUTFELD: Yes, I've been taking massage orders from men in Ohio.WILLIAMS: Yes, wearing panties.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Gosh.GUTFELD: That is not untrue, by the way.GUILFOYLE: We disavow that statement. I have something serious.GUTFELD: Save it.PERINO: Save us.GUILFOYLE: So here's an opportunity. Right? Dana, you talked about a lot of people said there's some opportunity there. Definitely, you know, Trump had a good debate performance. He hit some points on her, was solid, and she didn't refute a lot of it.Here is an opportunity here where she's saying, ""Look, this is determined by intelligence agencies. That, in fact, has verified that the Russians have hacked servers.""And then he needs to follow up and say, ""But yet you believe that the Russians didn't hack and couldn't hack your e-mail server and that it was secure. So you can't have it both ways."" That's another opportunity to kind of get in her at that. Because that made us less safe. If the Russians are capable of hacking all this, you had your own personal server, which was not recommended or proper policy. Therefore endangering national security.WILLIAMS: Well, he didn't do it.GUILFOYLE: ""You cannot be trusted.""WILLIAMS: He could -- that would have been awesome.BOLLING: Juan, I know you want to go. Let me just add one more thing.WILLIAMS: All right.BOLLING: The right answer to that one, the Russians come up, with either Chris or Hillary as you say, stop right here. If you're really that worried about Putin and if you're really that worried about Russians, why did your State Department and why did you sign off on selling them 20 percent or 25 percent of U.S. uranium? Because that deal -- if you're worried about them and they have the bomb, you don't do that. You keep that here.WILLIAMS: By the way...BOLLING: That undermines the whole Russian...GUILFOYLE: You said that to me last night, during the debate.WILLIAMS: I think -- I think we weren't meddling in the Ukraine. I think they're the ones who...GUTFELD: Yes. Just -- you know.WILLIAMS: Hillary Clinton was also pressed about the Clinton Foundation. Here she is dodging Chris Wallace's questions about pay-for-play allegations.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values. I'm thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation, because it is a world-renowned charity. And I am so proud of the work that it does.TRUMP: It's a criminal enterprise. Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries. You talk about women and women's rights. So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings. These are people that kill women and treat women horribly. And yet you take their money.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Dana.PERINO: I thought that was one of his best answers of the night. I would add when he talked about the middle east and the state of the middle east and the connections that you can draw directly to Obama decisions of which she was a part of the administration. That was very good.The other thing about her, I think she dodged that question, basically. She sort of avoided it. And America Rising PAC, today they had a video that I clicked on. It was a legitimate link. It was not a fishy link. About how Doug Band from Taneo (ph) and the Clinton Global Initiative talking about gifts that were given directly to Bill Clinton.And this has been an organization that definitely has helped deliver HIV/AIDS drugs to people who are suffering around the world. And at the same time, taking money that is very questionable, and I think any other group probably would have been nailed on it. But she dodged it and probably is going to get away with it.WILLIAMS: Well, I think, you know, there was another one where borders -- I think the open borders, she is able to move away. Trump didn't -- couldn't hold her in place.Another big topic of the night was abortion. Does Trump want to overturn Roe versus Wade? Does Hillary still believe the unborn don't have constitutional rights. Chris Wallace got answers. Watch next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Well, millions of women in America were listening very closely last night when Trump and Clinton shared their positions on abortion. Whomever ends up in the Oval Office will be appointing justices to the Supreme Court who could potentially reverse a landmark abortion decision. Trump was asked about it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe versus Wade which includes, in fact states, a woman's right to abortion?TRUMP: Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.WALLACE: Do you want to see the court overturn Roe versus Wade?TRUMP: Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen. And that will happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Chris Wallace pressed Clinton on her position. He asked why she voted against a ban on late term partial birth abortions, and then Trump piled on.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion, so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.TRUMP: If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: OK. Women, Dana, obviously listening very closely to the answers that both candidates gave. Trump right away stood up and said, ""I am pro-life. I will appoint justices that are pro-life. Believe this should go back to the states."" And then when Chris pressed him, he said, ""Yes, I believe it will probably happen automatically and pretty quickly, because I will appoint two to three.""PERINO: Well, he -- but he avoided the question. And the question was, do you want Roe v. Wade to be overturned? And I think that his answer was one that he probably had in debate prep. He's like, don't get into it.He was stronger for -- if you're a pro-life person, his answer on partial birth abortion was persuasive. For her -- we talked about the substantive issues at the beginning. I think that her answers were specifically geared towards the suburban women that she's doing very well with that he is not doing as well with and needs to do better with.And I do think that if you -- I'm a pro-life person. And it's difficult to talk about abortion. For me, it's difficult. I admire people who are able to stand by their faith and talk about it publically. I think that Governor Pence did a wonderful job of talking about it in the vice- presidential debate.GUILFOYLE: He did.PERINO: But President [SIC] -- Hillary Clinton, Secretary Clinton, when she was talking about her view, it was as impassioned. And I do think that, on that point, with the audience that she cares about, she won.GUILFOYLE: Now, so Bolling, that probably, obviously, was strong for conservatives, pro-life conservatives, evangelicals, core...BOLLING: Constitutional conservatives.GUILFOYLE: Right. For...BOLLING: And then straight down the line.GUILFOYLE: Did he need help with those groups? And to shore it up, did he get any benefit from it?BOLLING: That's a good point. Great point. Maybe he already had them. I mean, that's very possible.There is the knock that Donald Trump isn't a true conservative. Maybe he wants some votes in, you know, that -- that group that says, ""I want to vote for the guy, because he's a Republican, and I definitely don't want the Democrat. But he's not conservative enough for me.""And again, for me, this has come down to the single-issue vote. Again, it's the Supreme Court. Yes, abortion falls under it, no matter what your feelings are on abortion. But so do Second Amendment rights. So does immigration. So do a vast many other things that fall under the Supreme Court.And for -- and I think Trump -- you're right, that's the only answer he could have provided at that moment.GUILFOYLE: Right. And he tried to really hit the partial birth abortion, late-term abortion.BOLLING: It's not a copout to say it will go back to the states, because if you're a true conservative, you believe everything should go back to the states.GUILFOYLE: OK. So Greg, what did you think of the two answers, juxtaposed? How did they do?GUTFELD: Well, it was just unusual, because this is the third debate, and this is -- it just shows you how rare social issues have come up in this kind of new election, where you have, basically, Trump, who's a non- ideologue who, for the longest time, was pro-choice. Very, very pro- choice.But the interesting thing I always go back to is if fetuses could vote, what party would they belong to?PERINO: Absolutely.GUTFELD: You know? Talk about a silent majority.And you look at, like, what outrages you? We -- you know, Roe v. Wade, it's not going to be overturned. But you should -- there should be moral outrage regarding practices like partial-birth abortion. And if you -- what the left does is they disingenuously extend your outrage to all parts of abortion.And the fact is what that does is it puts everybody on their back foot who have understandable outrage.But if you don't have a certain kind of outrage about this, then, in a sense, everything is permissible. You can do anything. And there will be, in the future, moral, philosophical arguments by ethics. People that work, say, for the White House will be discussing whether or not you should be able to put to death babies that are born unhealthy.I mean, you could extend this beyond childbirth...PERINO: Right.GUTFELD: ... to an entirely new disturbing area. And there are ethicists who actually entertain these kind of thought experiments about what you do with people who are burdens.WILLIAMS: Yes. Death panels. Remember that?GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: So I think that's an extension of the argument.But the problem -- I strongly disagree. Because I think Trump refused to say that he wants Roe v. Wade overturned. Instead, he's tried to dodge -- he was slippery on it and then used the states as a fallback. And I thought he couldn't pivot.And then he put himself in a position where he used what Hillary Clinton called scare rhetoric: rip the baby from the mother in the ninth month. And, you know, to me, Hillary Clinton, when she came back and said, to your point, Greg, government should not be involved in such personal decisions about a woman and her health, leave it to the women, leave it to her doctor, leave it to her faith, to me that's pretty strong.GUTFELD: But the government is already involved. Correct?WILLIAMS: But government -- when she talked about the Chinese and the Romanians making choices for women.GUTFELD: Which will be next. It's happening.GUILFOYLE: Also, the health of the mother involved. No one is saying, ""Hey, the mother should die and the child...""WILLIAMS: That's why she said she voted as she did in the Senate.GUILFOYLE: She's using those tactics, too, and saying that Planned Parenthood would be completely de-funded. And the issue was about federal funding for abortion services versus health of the women and wellness checks, and that type of thing, those type of female things.GUTFELD: Female things.GUILFOYLE: Yes. You know about them, Greg.PERINO: We know those.GUILFOYLE: Now that the debates are over, where will the race turn next? If you want to know, stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: The debates are finally over. Where will this election go in the final 19 days?Kimberly, I think there are going to be more shoes falling than your closet during an earthquake.BOLLING: Nice.GUTFELD: What do you predict?PERINO: There goes one.GUTFELD: There you go.There are millions of men around the country...GUILFOYLE: A lot of (UNINTELLIGIBLE)PERINO: We aim to please.GUILFOYLE: Yes, exactly. Where do I think it's going to go?GUTFELD: You've got 30 seconds.GUILFOYLE: I think that Trump is feeling confident after he delivered that performance except for the fact that he's saying he might contest the election. He's saying, ""I'll surprise you."" But other than that, I mean, look, I still -- I don't think Clinton should think this is over by a long shot.GUTFELD: Thirty seconds, Juan, if it's possible.WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, right now...GUILFOYLE: Picking my shoe up.WILLIAMS: ... I'm not sure what he can do, because that was the last major opportunity to change the direction. Right now you have so many states that are supposedly red states that look like they're actually turning blue. I'm thinking here even Utah, Arizona, Georgia. I don't know how he turns that around.BOLLING: There's one other opportunity, and that's tonight, Al Smith dinner. If you've never seen this, you've got to tune into this. FOX is going to cover it. Probably during the 9 p.m. hour, maybe going into the 10, as well. Both candidates will be there, and they'll be roasting each other and themselves. Tongue in cheek, fun.PERINO: I hope it's fun.BOLLING: Bush 43 was hilarious, and so was Obama.GUILFOYLE: Are you going?BOLLING: So tonight, FOX News probably...PERINO: I'm not going to miss that.GUILFOYLE: You went one time, Bolling.BOLLING: It was amazing. Hilarious.PERINO: To Juan's point, Michelle Obama is in Arizona right now. Trying to rally the troops out there. And she's saying that by saying there's a rigged election, he's trying to make sure you don't come out and vote. But I'm telling you, your vote matters.And so they've deployed their most important asset in the campaign, Michelle Obama, to a red state, because they're going to try to make a play and expand the map.The other thing is, I saw there's a lot of disappointment that one of your favorite subjects has not come up in any of the debates.GUTFELD: Artificial intelligence?PERINO: Climate change.GUTFELD: Oh, you're being sarcastic.PERINO: There's a lot of disappointment on the left.GUTFELD: Yes, I saw that.My only point is, you know, they didn't shake hands yesterday before the debate. And I don't think they shook hands after. I was at the airport. I wanted to look at politics. And the bartender said, ""You know what? A lot of people, they don't want to have politics at the bar or at the casino, because people are getting so upset.""So my final thought is, when this is all over, will we be able to forgive and forget?GUILFOYLE: We couldn't get it at the casino either.GUTFELD: Yes. Will we all be able to get along again? Like a family.PERINO: Kumbaya.GUILFOYLE: We can hug it out later.GUTFELD: That's all I wanted to know.PERINO: But for the next 19 days.GUTFELD: They also want your shoe. ""One More Thing"" is up next.GUILFOYLE: OK.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: So it's time now for ""One More Thing."" I'll go quickly. So tonight, there's the Al Smith dinner. You're going to want to watch that live on FOX. But if you are channel surfing during commercial breaks, which you shouldn't do, go to my live book signing. I'm going to have Jasper there. We have a little video.GUTFELD: Great.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: I was noticing these hilarious Photoshops on Twitter from an anonymous person named FiveFanPhotoshop. And he would put Jasper into different settings, whether news of the day or on set with us on ""The Five"" or ""Red Eye.""(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Jacket.GUILFOYLE: No, I want it.PERINO: That was the jacket everybody wore in New Hampshire. It was Greg's, but we all had a time in it.GUILFOYLE: Who wore it best?PERINO: Kimberly, definitely. You won that contest. I hope you will join me tonight. It will be fun.GUTFELD: All right.GUILFOYLE: Jasper, legit online.PERINO: Eric, you're next.BOLLING: So very quickly, last night she said this. Hillary Clinton said this, blew my mind. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: So here is what we thought we'd do. Economics lesson for Hillary Clinton. Let's talk about the deficit. Here's the deficit. The last Bush deficit was $459 billion. President Obama raised the deficit for the first three or four years of his presidency, brought it back down to $587 billion.But you want to know what the reality is? That he actually increased the deficit by $127 billion, or 128 percent of Bush's deficit.And let's talk about debt very quickly. Here's what he inherited, $10.6 trillion in debt. He is going out with $19.6 trillion. He tacked on $9 trillion in debt. So deficits and debt hasn't been a pretty picture. Sorry.WILLIAMS: Gee, wonder about that recession.GUTFELD: All right. It is...BOLLING: It's what she said. That's all I'm talking about.GUTFELD: What she said.GUILFOYLE: Who's a toddler?PERINO: I'm going to go to Greg next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: I hate these people!(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: You know what I hate? I fly -- took a red eye last night on Virgin. I love Virgin American. It's my favorite airline. But they always do this. Can we play this for a second?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (singing): In the unlikely event we need to get you outside...(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Oh, my God.GUTFELD: All right. So this is their safety instructional video. And they crank it up so loud. And it's like a really bad Black-Eyes [SIC] Peas -- Black-Eyed Peas song done by rejects from ""Fame."" It is the most insidious, horrible thing I've ever heard.Virgin, I'm not going to fly anymore if you continue to play this video, especially on a red eye flight, when people are trying to sleep. Makes me sick to my stomach. I hate these people.PERINO: And you know red eyes.GUTFELD: Yes. I know red eyes.GUILFOYLE: Thank God we weren't on the same plane, to hear you rant.GUTFELD: I want the old-school flight attendant who has the little -- the little belt; they do the little belt thing.GUILFOYLE: OK.PERINO: K.G.GUILFOYLE: Fine. Gosh.All right. Look at this amazing video coming out of Thailand. It's going viral. Now, this is a little young elephant rescuing a man in the river. He thought the man was drowning. So the baby goes in: ""Let me save you. Let me save you."" And this is Darrick Thompson, co-founder of the Save Elephant Foundation.He was actually going for a dip in the river, but the elephant, Kham Lha, one of the foundation's rescued ones, was like, ""I will save you,"" like ""Baywatch."" So she mistook him calling out to her from the water as a cry for help. Trying to save him by offering her trunk. Is this the cutest thing you've ever seen?She's one of 70 elephants the foundation have rescued.PERINO: They're amazing. Amazing animals.GUTFELD: They got married later.WILLIAMS: All right.PERINO: Juan.WILLIAMS: What a night for the first debate with a FOX moderator.
