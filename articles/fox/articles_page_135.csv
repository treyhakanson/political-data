This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Every week viewers vote for your choice online in this, our Friday Lightning Round. This week the big winner, health care won with 33 percent of the vote. This of course comes as we are waiting for the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on the health care challenge. And we learned a little bit more up on Capitol Hill this week, as well. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN, R - TENNESSEE: The White House was over here working with Pharma, trying to construct this language. The White House was not going to let special interests influence any of this. But yet you've got an organization that is out here basically writing the health care bill. (END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Republicans are point to go e-mails released that came out this week that said that the administration was doing, as was suspected, some dealing with the pharmaceutical companies before the health care bill was put together. What about all of this and how it factors in in the big picture? Steve, it doesn't seem like health care overall, the law, has been very popular according to the polls, depending on how you ask the question. STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: It hasn't been. I would say, those E-mails had the potential had they gotten more coverage too have been quite damaging. But people have sort of moved beyond the construction of the health care bill and they're now, everybody is waiting for the Supreme Court decision and a potential debate about where this goes if the court upholds the mandate. BAIER: But the e-mails do kind of shatter the whole transparency talk from the administration about anything that was happening in the construction of that bill? RICK KLEIN, SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER, ABC NEWS: I this it was pretty well shattered and has been for a while. The bill itself, in part was so unpopular because those negotiations weren't televised on C-Span and the cornhusker kickback and on all of that. And now the court is gonna jump in the middle of this and have a decision later this month that is potentially going to upend all of the politics we're talking around this. Interestingly, talk to some Democrats, there are some who quietly aren't that scared of the prospect of this being thrown out, the idea of removing this albatross from them going into the fall, taking away this big issue and giving them something to motivate their voters out there -- the politics of this may already be settled, even though it's going to very much change the equation to have the signature accomplishment of President Obama's first term potentially thrown out.BAIER: Charles? CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, that's a three-cushion shot interpretation of what would happen if the court overturned it, which I've entertained because it's so interesting and perverse.But I think in the end it's gonna be a straight shot. If it's overturned it's gonna be a huge setback for the president. His signature achievement, he spent a year and a half on instead of working on the economy. And the idea that this professor of constitutional law got it so wrong, he and the Democratic leadership, that they weren't even aware of the constitutional issues, in the most important thing he did in the Congress, I think psychologically it will be devastatingBAIER: But to Rick's point, for moderate Democrats especially, it may be a bit of a relief not to have to defend the health care -- KRAUTHAMMER: In their Congressional races, yes. But for the president who is so closely linked with this, I think it's a net loss and it's a big loss. BAIER: OK, the next topic is this cyber warfare that a big article again in the New York Times talking about how President Obama secretly ordered the increase of sophisticated attacks on computer systems in Iran, including the Stuxnet virus we've heard a lot about. There's been some angst about this story and others in recent days. Steve, intel officials -- not happy about all this. HAYES: No, it's very interesting. I started the morning with some responses that I was getting from intel people, national security people who are concerned about the leaks and the fact that this was laid out on the pages of the New York Times, and that increased as the day went on. And I finally talked to a couple of very senior former intelligence officials who said David Petraeus needs to do a crimes report on this and start an investigation into the leak. The bigger problem I think from some of these people as one person said it appears to professionals that the information that they have been sworn to protect is being used for political purposes by the White House. That's a problem in the intelligence community.BAIER: Rick? KLEIN: Interesting and you played a little bit earlier in the show something that Leon Panetta said about cyber warfare and the idea that it actually wouldn't be warfare. The implication here is that we may be at war with Iran over what's going on. It's stunning, and it's a stunning revelation. And it comes, as you mentioned, we are learning more about -- about the president and how aggressive he's been in some of the national security areas. And I think this is just -- it's a really fascinating development with a lot of potential tentacles. And it gets us into some hot water potentially. The idea, the concept of a retaliation would very much need to be on the table. KRAUTHAMMER: It's beyond a problem, it's a scandal. Leaking the details that we saw in that plan about a very, very highly secret operation, the name of the operation, how it worked, when it worked, how it leaked out, the fact that we had Israeli cooperation, the name of the secret Israeli unit. All that was missing were the Hebrew names of the Israeli agents and their street addresses in Jerusalem. You wonder how an administration could do this, could allow all of these secrets out and jeopardize what we have done simply as a way to boost the president in an election year. I think it is a scandal. BAIER: Down the road, Democrats worried about Charlotte, North Carolina, being the convention site? KRAUTHAMMER: It's going to be embarrassing. KLEIN: Yes, but they can't do anything about it. They chose it for their political reasons and they're stuck for it. HAYES: But they just allowed sales for booze on Sunday which alleviates one problem. (LAUGHTER)BAIER: That's it for the panel. But stay tuned for something all realtors emphasize -- location, location, location.    Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

1	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2012/04/11/obama-playing-politics-tax-reform/	Obama playing politics with tax reform?	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" April 10, 2012. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Do we want to keep giving those tax breaks to folks like me who don't need them, or give them to Warren Buffett? He definitely doesn't need them. Or Bill Gates - he's already said, ""I don't need them""? Or do we want to keep investing if those things that keep our economy growing and keep us secure? That is the choice.FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: If the goal is private sector growth, you got to recognize that the best way to create that growth is to leave capital in the treasuries of the job creators.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER: Former President Bush, a rare appearance today, and the current president in Florida talking about the so-called ""Buffett rule"", embracing that, raising taxes specifically on capital gains for the wealthy. As we take a look at some polls in the Obama approval, according to the latest Washington Post/ABC poll, there you see approve and disapprove. But handling the economy. it's a different story in this poll, 44 percent approve, 54 percent disapprove. And head-to-head against Mitt Romney, which do you trust more to hand the economy? There you see 47 percent to the president's 43 percent. And which do you trust more to protect the middle class? Again, it changes, 49 to 39.We're back with the panel. Charles, what about the so-called ""Buffett rule"" and how the president is using it and talking about it?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, let's understand what all of this is about. This is absolutely nothing but re-election politics. What he has done is to literally pit the 99 percent against the one percent. And he has done in a clever way. He basically has turned Occupy Wall Street into legislation, except that the real people in the streets -- in the Occupy Wall Street streets never had the wit to actually come up with this idea. This is a way of saying you that you're going to take the money from the rich and give it to the poor.Obama is not a good governor. He doesn't know how to be a president. But he sure knows how to campaign.And the second sort of political genius here is essentially what this is about is raising the capital gains taxes. The reason that the rich are paying less is so much of the income of a Buffett or a Romney is in capital gains. But he doesn't sell that it way. He sells it as the fair share of the rich and paying a minimum tax. The reason he does that is because everybody knows, that if you look back over the last half century, capital gains taxes have a perverse effect. You raise them, you reduce the amount of money the Treasury gets. You lower them, you increase the amount.But in 2008 when Obama was asked by Charlie Gibson would you raise capital gains taxes even if it brings in to treasury less revenue, his answer was yes in the name of fairness. He is running on that -- fairness. Damn the economy. Romney will run on efficiency, and I don't really care if the rich get ahead on account of that. And Obama has a good idea. He can't run on his record and he doesn't have a vision or program for a second term. So why not run on fairness?BAIER: A.B.?A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, THE HILL: Well, this is an issue that dating back more than a year has polled very well for Obama. The last Associated Press poll in February had it at 65 percent. The Washington Post, that same poll, talks about the issue of unfairness versus overregulation and unfairness beats out over regulation in terms of the effect on the economy.This is also the political equivalent of shooting fish in a barrel because they have Mitt Romney to target. So Mitt Romney pays a 13.9 percent rate of taxes. He only releases one year-and-a-half of his tax records. There's reports now that he is sheltering in his earnings from Bain. He has a Swiss bank account. He is really the perfect foil for, you know, sort of profile of the opponent of the ""Buffett rule.""President Obama, it's not a lot of money. He says -- on the White House website it says it's a key step to reduce the deficit. It is not. But it is -- politically, it is a distraction from the March jobs report. That we learned about on Friday. If the economy begins to tumble, we will hear a lot about fairness. It is true inside those polls, however, that voters look more to the handling of the economy issue and the job creation issue than they do to the tax fairness issue. I just think politically it could work if the economy continues to remain strong because of the profile of Mitt Romney as this very rich man who hasn't paid enough.STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: It will probably work politically, but don't reporters have a job to do here? I mean, isn't it job of the media to put it in perspective? The ""Buffett rule"" would raise less than six percent of the total cost of the stimulus. And if you look at ""Buffett rule,"" it would raise, roughly, the same amount in one year, $4 billion according to the Joint Taxation -- Joint Committee on Taxation, $4 billion in one year as the government U.S. accumulates in debt in a single day.This is totally meaningless. It is completely worthless. And yet the president has spent more time talking about this than virtually any other specific economic policy proposal at a time when the economy is struggling, when we've had a bad jobs report. This is the president's plan. It's not a plan. It's not serious. There is nothing serious about it. And reporters should do their job and put this in perspective.BAIER: The other thing is, there are all kinds of numbers flying out there. But take a look at these numbers about -- from Americans for Tax Reform. These are the breakdowns of the percent of all tax revenues. Top one percent which is $344,000 and up, the income tax percent 39.5, all federal taxes 28 percent. And then roughly $65,000 family, 4.6 percent in income tax, 9.2 percent all federal taxes.And then you talk about the rates. The top one percent income tax, 19 percent, all federal taxes 29 percent, and the middle income again, $65,000 a year, 3.3 percent, 14.3 percent. Charles, quickly, there will be a number of numbers, but they will glaze over, I'm sure.KRAUTHAMMER: I'm not sure the Republicans ought to concede the grounds of fairness. They ought to argue and quote John Kennedy who lowered taxes, including capital gains, as a way of stimulating the economy and creating jobs. That's the winning answer.BAIER: That is it for panel. But stay tuned for some not so smooth talking.Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2012 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

2	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2012/05/02/politics-bin-laden-anniversary/	The politics of the Bin Laden anniversary	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" May 1, 2012. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, ""THIS MORNING""/CBS)MITT ROMNEY, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I acknowledge the president's success and I think he has every right to take credit for him having ordered that attack. At the same time I think it was very disappointing for the president to try and make this a political item by suggesting that I wouldn't have ordered such a raid. Of course I would have. Any American, any thinking American would have ordered exactly the same thing.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, HOST: Presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney talking about the politics around the bin Laden killing anniversary. Chuck, what about this? And is there a point at which there is a backlash here?CHARLES LANE, EDITORIAL WRITER, WASHINGTON POST: There is. We don't know exactly where it is. For every voter it's a little bit different. So the president has to be kind of careful not to overdo it. We have to see whether this is something from the anniversary or whether it's something they will keep doing all year long, in which case I think he is running a little bit of a risk.There is an irony here. He is criticizing Mitt Romney for not wanting to do this raid. But his own vice president, Joe Biden, has gone public saying he didn't want to do the raid. He advised the president not to do the raid. So --STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: If there was ever anything to convince you to do it is if Joe Biden advised against it.LANE: That might have been what happened. But he's trying to make the case that Romney was totally, you know, off the reservation by even thinking don't do it. And yet his own number two had the same view.BAIER: And, Juan, you have Arianna Huffington, who is not that well known a conservative, she doesn't usually come from that point of view, but she said there is no way to know that Romney would have not made that decision, and to speculate he wouldn't is not the way to run a campaign.JUAN WILLIAMS, SENIOR EDITOR, THE HILL: Well, you know, to my mind, this is politics. We are in a political season. I think the official starting date for the campaign is supposed to be Saturday. We have been in the political season now for some time. And the fact is that Mitt Romney when he was running in 2007 said, you know what, it's not worth moving heaven and earth to catch one person. That was what he said. And then you have people like Hillary Clinton chastising Barack Obama for saying he would go in to Pakistan to get bin Laden.BAIER: Saying it publicly, Juan.WILLIAMS: Correct. Right. They're politicians. Yes. He said it publicly.BAIER: That was the criticism, that he said it publicly, not that he would haven't done it.WILLIAMS: At the time, Bret, they were running for office and they were laying down markers as to who they were, especially in the aftermath of the fact that President Bush who was a clear, strong advocate of going after Al Qaeda, had been unable to get bin Laden.BAIER: But you acknowledge you cannot say something on the campaign trail but yet do it privately?WILLIAMS: Correct. But remember then Mitt Romney changes his position and says of course I would go in and fete him. And so now, in this political season -- and, again, I understand the politics. I understand why the Obama campaign is bringing it up and I understand why they had Bill Clinton hawking this now in a video for political reasons. But to me, there is an element of appearing unseemly.BAIER: I want to play this really quickly. This is former Defense Secretary Bob Gates after the bin Laden raid talking about intelligence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, MAY 12, 2011)BOB GATES, FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY: A week ago Sunday, in the situation room, we all agreed that we would not release any of operational details from the effort to take out bin Laden. That all fell apart on Monday, the next day.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Steve, there has been a lot of concern about the fact that intelligence actually wasn't fully mined because it was already out.HAYES: Yes. I agree with Secretary Gates as it relates to the operational details of the raid. But I would actually make the opposite argument in a broader context. I think we should declassify everything that we can without affecting the operational ability that we got in the compound in Abbottabad. I think we should declassify the intelligence that led us to get Usama bin Laden. We have been having this national debate now for a decade about the way we gather intelligence and interrogate. This could clear up a lot if they declassified these documents.BAIER: That is it for panel.Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

4	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2013/04/23/bill-oreilly-politics-and-boston-terror-situation/	Bill O'Reilly: Politics and the Boston terror situation	"By Bill O'ReillyEven while the two suspects were at large, people like Barney Frank were politicizing the Boston terror bombing and incredibly some in the press were doing that as well.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMINA ISMAIL: I send my deepest condolence to the victims and families in Boston. President Obama said that what happened in Boston was an act of terrorism. I would like to ask do you consider the U.S. bombing on civilians in Afghanistan earlier this month that killed, that left 11 children and a woman killed a form of terrorism? Why or why not?CARNEY: Well, I would have to know more about the incident and obviously the Department of Defense would have answers to your questions on this matter.(END VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: Here is how ridiculous that question really is. The USA is fighting a war, a war in Afghanistan. In every war, collateral damage happens. Civilians are killed. There is no way to prevent it. It is not U.S. policy to target civilians in Afghanistan. In fact, we go out of our way not to.Everybody knows that. Yet, this woman has the nerve at a White House press conference to equate military battlefield action with the bombing of civilians of Boston. Very disturbing.But here is something even provocative, former NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw apparently putting some of the motivation for the Boston bombings on his own country.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BROKAW: I think we also have to examine the use of drones. That the United States is involved in and there are a lot of civilians who are innocently killed in a drone attack in Pakistan and Afghanistan and in Iraq. And I can tell you having spent a lot of time over there, young people will come up to me on the streets and say we love America, but if you harm one hair on the head of my sister, I will fight you forever. And there is this enormous rage against what they see in that part of the world as a presumption of the United States.(END VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: Let me get this straight, Tom. We shouldn't use drones to attack al Qaeda leadership or Taliban terrorists hiding in the mountains of Pakistan? We shouldn't do that?So how exactly would you fight the war against terrorism, Tom? Do you want to invade Pakistan? Is that what you want to do? Or do you want to sit back and let terrorists hatch their plots and watch Americans die at home and on the battlefield?It's either/or, Tom. Either/or. One or the other. I challenge you to come on this broadcast and answer that question. Of course, Tom Brokaw will not do that, much too difficult. And he wouldn't associate with the peasants here on The Factor. No. He is up here.It drives me crazy. This stuff really makes me angry.Now, it is worth noting that during World War II, USA did target civilians in Japan and Germany. It did what it had to do to win the war to deal with Tojo and the Nazis but now we have cadre of Americans who for some reason don't feel that the USA has a right to defend itself.Every decent person laments civilian casualties anywhere. But again, in war, they happen. So, it's time to knock off the nonsense. The war on terrorism is real. The dead and wounded in Boston are real. And this ridiculous left-wing moral equivalency is insulting.And that's ""The Memo."""
