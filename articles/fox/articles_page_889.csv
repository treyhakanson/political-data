Marco Rubio and Mike Lee on tax reform, Netanyahu's speech and Hillary's email woes	" This is a rush transcript from ""On the Record,"" March 4, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Right now, two powerful Senators and one powerful plan to overhaul our tax code and your taxes. Florida Senator Marco Rubio and Utah Senator Mike Lee teaming up, going ON THE RECORD to talk about their plan to overhaul your taxes. That's not all. They have much more to say.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)VAN SUSTEREN: Senators, nice to see both of you.SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R- FLA.: Thank you.SEN. MIKE LEE, R-UTAH: Likewise.VAN SUSTEREN: You have a proposal for tax reform.And let me start first with you, Senator Rubio.What is your tax reform proposal?RUBIO: It does two things. It's pro-family and pro-growth. On the business side, it's, I think, the most aggressive pro-growth plan I have seen in the while. It will make America the best place in the world to invest and innovate again. It tells companies, the more money you pour back into the company by growing, by building a new factory, hiring more workers, the less you are going to pay in taxes.VAN SUSTEREN: So it goes to the corporate tax?RUBIO: It goes not just do the corporate tax, it takes away the disincentive to invest and improving your capital facilities. It says that you can you immediately expense whatever money you spend to grow your business, you can immediate deduct that from your taxes. That will encourage more businesses to grow, to start new lines of work, to expand operations and hire more people.VAN SUSTEREN: Senator Lee, as I understand one of the provisions bringing the corporate tax down 35 percent to 25 percent. But a lot of American people have other objections to the tax code, is that they can't figure out their own taxes, that they are 3300 or 3500 earmarks in it if you follow Simpson/Bowles, so they don't like that. Members of Congress can't fill out their own tax reform and neither can the rest of us because nobody can fill it out. So while it's laudable to lower the corporate tax rate to spur business, what about the little guy out there?LEE: Well, there is a lot in this plan for them. In fact, that's why we wrote this is to help the little guy, on the individual side and on the business side. I mean, look, I sit on the Joint Economic Committee here in Congress. A few months ago, we had an expert who came to testify as a witness. This man had a PhD in the U.S. Income tax code. That was his Phd. I feel bad for the guy but that's where he chose to pursue his doctoral studies. I asked him, do you do your own taxes, he said, no, absolutely not. Why? There is no way I will ever be sure I got it right. That's one of the things that got me thinking, how can we change this because we have got to change it.VAN SUSTEREN: Does your reform bill, besides -- I mean, I realize that there are going to be fewer tax brackets, and I realize that corporate advantage. You know, for the person who is filling out his tax -- a lot of people want a flat tax. They want a sales tax. They want a lot of things. They want like wild reform to change everything. Does yours do that?LEE: Absolute. And for 80 percent of Americans, this would be a flat tax. This would be single-rate tax system.VAN SUSTEREN: When we start going into the deductions, the -- as I call them loopholes or the earmarks, it get so enormously complicated. That seems a little unfair.(CROSSTALK)VAN SUSTEREN: Maybe you're a lobbyist, you get a loophole.(CROSSTALK)VAN SUSTEREN: Are you getting rid of all that?RUBIO: All of them except the mortgage and charitable deduction. Everything else is that flatter tax rate. For 80 percent of Americans, they'll be paying 15 percent. If they have children, of course, they qualify for the child tax credit. It would significantly simplify it. It's a major step in the direction of flattening the tax code and making it easier to fill out.VAN SUSTEREN: I take it you involved all the Republicans in the Senate to go with you. Could you get any Democrats?LEE: Well, I have been in conversations with some Democrats about it. Some of them are very intrigued. We are going to see where we can go with this.VAN SUSTEREN: Lots going on on Capitol Hill. Netanyahu, prime minister yesterday, any thoughts on his speech?LEE: I thought it was an absolutely amazing speech. And I have never -- I have been here four years as has Senator Rubio. I have never seen anyone address a joint session of Congress and be received so well. I have never seen anyone present a joint session of Congress and inspire the place to erupt as if a rock star had entered the room.VAN SUSTEREN: Because his speech will have an impact?RUBIO: I do. He spoke like a man. He spoke like what he is, a man country fighting for survival, faced by a brutal enemy who wants to eradicate them from the face of the earth and is on the verge of acquiring capability. He sees the strongest ally in the world, the United States, on the verge of signing a terrible deal that virtually guarantees at some point in the next decade that Iran will have a nuclear weapon and will do so with the permission of the international community. That's what he spoke of, as somebody who understands what's at stake here. We should heed his warnings.VAN SUSTEREN: What about the Hillary Clinton, secretary of state, controversy over the emails?RUBIO: Number one, it appears she violated the rules that the State Department had established. But the bigger concern is was she transacting government business on a server that's not secure? Because we know these servers are targets for foreign intelligence. We know the Chinese, the Russians, the North Koreans, the Cubans and others are constantly trying to hack into computers, and especially that of governmental officials. She if was transacting State Department business on an insecure server, that alone is reason to be alarmed.VAN SUSTEREN: Senator?LEE: It will be interesting to see how it pans out. I don't know a lot of facts of the case, but I echo the concerns expressed by Senator Rubio.VAN SUSTEREN: You have been here four years. Politics meaner than you expected?LEE: Well, you know, sure. It's mean. There is a lot of mean to be had here. But I think a lot of times people miss the fact that there is also a lot of nice here. There are a lot of people who get along well. Marco and I both have friends on the other side of the aisle. We both have colleagues with whom we agree on several issues while disagreeing on a whole lot of others. And I think there is a lot more goodwill here between members of different parties than a lot of people are inclined to think.VAN SUSTEREN: I'm not going to ask you if you are going to run. Why would you want it?RUBIO: Well, first of all, just some perspective about the nature of our politics, in America, if you say something -- if you are opposed to someone's ideas, they will write a bad editorial or maybe run a negative campaign. In Russia, they shoot you. So just have some perspective about --(CROSSTALK)VAN SUSTEREN: In Iraq and Syria, you get your head chopped off.RUBIO: Exactly right.VAN SUSTEREN: Just for a thought.RUBIO: Look, as I said before, I'm seriously thinking about running for president. I haven't made a final decision. Either way, I think important for our country to transition into the 21st century. It's time to turn the page on the 21st century. Part of that is to become globally competitive again. That's why I'm excited about tax reform. It makes us globally competitive again.VAN SUSTEREN: I think most people agree we should do something about our taxes. When none of us can do our taxes ourselves, that's a bad sign.Anyway, Senators, thank you both.RUBIO: Thank you.LEE: Thank you.(END VIDEOTAPE)"

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST, ""THE KELLY FILE"":  Breaking tonight.  You are looking live at the streets of Chicago, where earlier tonight, violent protests broke out before a rally for presidential candidate Donald Trump at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  The scene inside the event was described as chaotic.  And as the A.P. reported, it seems for the first time the number of protesters equaled that of Trump supporters.  That reality forcing Mr. Trump and his team to cancel the event just moments before it was set to begin out of an abundance of caution.  We are live on the streets of Chicago, for a complete Fox coverage for you tonight.  Joining us first with more, jour Fox Business Network Jeff Flock who is live on the scene in Chicago.  Jeff, get us up to speed.  JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  An extraordinary night here in Chicago, a town that's been home to a lot of protests over the past couple of months.  But tonight, we're on the street as rally goers, these are Trump rally goers, their cars leaving their venue now. Being jeered by protesters.  The protesters are still here.  But it was an extremely large crowd of protesters that had come to make their voice known against Donald Trump.  And I think what shut it down, it's fair to say, Megyn is, perhaps you can hear us, as these people make  their way out through this cordon of protesters, I think what did it is there was a large number of protesters that got in.  As you know, and so these other rallies, they've been able to eject individual protesters.  This was such a large group, however, a lot of people -- originally protesters tried to get tickets to the event and not come to the event so it would be a small event.  Well, others went inside and they were such a large group that it became clear that nobody was going to be able to eject all of them.  And at that point, Mr. Trump and his team made the decision to shut it down.  Big celebration after that.  People here on the streets of Chicago, I would say numbering, if not many hundreds, probably  thousands of people outside, celebrating that they had, in effect, shut this rally down and silenced Mr. Trump, at least for tonight.  It continues, as you see, these are Trump supporters that are shaking their fists at the Trump opponents who are being blocked off by police.  It's been an extraordinary night in Chicago, a town that has had a number of extraordinary protests over the course of the past several months -- Megyn.   KELLY:  Jeff, what group are the protesters from?  Are they identifiable?FLOCK:  I will tell you that this is an extremely diverse, or at least it has been.  And maybe you can even see in the faces that you look out across the street from us.  A very diverse crowd.  There are some Bernie Sanders' supporters.  There are students who don't like the fact or didn't like the fact that Donald Trump was going to be on their campus holding a rally.  Young, old, certainly Democrats in the crowd.  I talked to a few Republicans in the crowd who said, they just didn't want Donald Trump as their nominee, and didn't want his brand of hate speech to be heard in their town.  And they felt they needed to come out and be heard themselves.  KELLY:  Are we able to speak with any of them, Jeff or are the cops keeping the media away from the people?FLOCK:  Oh, no, we've been able to speak with them throughout the night.  Now, they're on the other side of the street right now, but let's see if I can -- what we've got, you know, we've got people on both sides of the street.  I probably don't want to go off and get in the midst of the crowd there, but maybe the police would -- well, let's see.  Well, no, there are obviously people coming by here.  The police have moved over to try to keep people apart.  And they've done a good job.  You know, you talk about violence.  There's been scattered outbursts, but largely not a problem.  Police have done a very good job of keeping people, protesters and Trump enthusiasts apart.  I don't know -- hey Dutch, walk over here with me so that we can show Megyn, if we can, the folks that are protesting here.  Here's a guy holding a sign, quite well dressed.  Can you tell me, sir, why you're here tonight?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm here in support of Bernie Sanders, and against the policies that Donald Trump has.  FLOCK:  Why did you think it was important for you to be heard tonight?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Because I'm a youth.  This is my first year, election year that I'm allowed to vote and I wanted to make my voice heard.  FLOCK:  Do you feel that you -- in doing this, shut down Mr. Trump's rights -- to his First Amendment rights to be heard?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I feel as if the people gave a reaction that was adequate of what they were feeling.  So, if the city felt that Trump didn't reflect what they wanted, the so be it, let the city speak.  FLOCK:  Megyn, hold with me one second because this is what has also been going on tonight.  This is a Trump supporter here, and these are folks that are opposed.  They've been having debates on the street all night.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Fox News, Fox News, Fox News, Fox News, Fox News, Fox News --FLOCK:  You've been having --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Fox News, Fox News, Fox News, Fox News --  FLOCK:  Can you say something --UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Fox News, Fox News.  FLOCK: -- why are you here tonight?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm here because I'm a taught to be a Chicagoan because Chicagoan do not like Donald Trump and his bullshit ideas.  And I'm very proud to be a Chicagoan today.  You can pan the camera around and see how many people are opposed to Donald Trump in the city of Chicago.  I'm very proud to be a Chicagoan today.  FLOCK:  Thank you.  I want to listen to -- student.  That's college today.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm a USC alumni, you ashole.  All right?  FLOCK:  Let's try to keep the language down.  But these kinds of debates Megyn, have been going on, on the streets of Chicago all night tonight. Trump supporters, folks that oppose, and there has not been any violence, I will say.  But interesting to see this sort of thing kind of just take place before our eyes and cameras tonight.  KELLY:  Indeed.  I don't know that that gentleman is making the impression he wishes to make in opposing the candidate he opposes.  Jeff, good to see you.  We'll be right back to you.  Stay safe.  I want to get over to John Roberts who is also in Chicago on the streets there.  John, what do you know?JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Megyn, good evening to you.  John -- John is a Trump supporter.  He's one of the lone Trump supporters in a sea of anti-Trump folks.  John, first of all, why are you supporting Donald Trump?JOHN, DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTER:  Oh, there's really only one reason that -- there's only really one reason that I support him, that would be his economic plans.  I feel that money speaks everything.  Now, what I feel is that money speaks -- I'm sorry, I can't speak.  ROBERTS:  Hey, guys, give him a chance to speak, all right?  And we'll come to you in a second.  Yes.  We'll come to you in a second.  Let him speak.  All right?  Go ahead, John.  Tell us why you're supporting Donald Trump.  JOHN:  I feel that money speaks a lot.  Like if we look in the case of Hillary Clinton, her money and her endorsements, they speak -- they -- I'm sorry, I can't speak with all of this.  ROBERTS:  Yes, okay, I understand.  Yes.  You have a lot of people behind you who are trying to disrupt you here.  But you were here to see him clearly tonight.  Are you disappointed that you didn't get a chance to see him?JOHN:  Yes, I was disappointed.  Unfortunately there was a gentleman that came up and, you know, kind of took over the stage and it was a lot of fight and it's really disappointing to see, you know, a lot of -- I'm not saying all of these, but a lot of these protesters say that there's hate here.  However, I feel that they demonstrated hate when we came here peacefully.  You know, I came with a ticket, and you know, obviously they did, as well.  ROBERTS:  Right.JOHN:  But I just feel that it's a bit of hypocrisy and I just don't feel right about it.  ROBERTS:  What is the hypocrisy, the fact that they're shutting down Donald Trump's First Amendment right to free speech and your ability to go see him and listen to him?JOHN:  Well, aside from that, also just like I said, the hate factor.  They said that, you know, he's hating, you know, against certain groups.  However, this -- I'm sorry --  (CROWD SCREAMING)ROBERTS:  That's okay.  Go ahead.  Just look at me.  Just keep your eyes on me.  Go ahead.JOHN:  I just feel that, you know, as soon as the riot began, I don't want to call it a riot --  ROBERTS:  Yes.(CROSSTALK)JOHN:  But as soon as it began, protesters began taking supporters signs and ripping them, and it was really just devastating to see.  Everyone was there peacefully to see Trump.  And just to see such like hate and violence, you know, and then accuse him of hate and violence, it was a bit of hypocrisy.  It was disappointing.  ROBERTS:  Well, John, thank you so much for talking to us.  Really appreciate it.  JOHN:  Thank you.ROBERTS:  We'll see if -- there was a fellow who wanted to express his views, but I can't see him now.  He seems to have disappeared.  Megyn, if I find him I'll get back to you but right back to you in New York.  KELLY:  John, just get us updated for those of us who are just getting up to speed on this story.  This began at a Trump rally.  ROBERTS:  Sure.KELLY:  He was going to go and rally the crowd there.  Illinois is a big state on Super Tuesday.  Did it ever get off the ground or had the protesters infiltrated from the start and then what happened?ROBERTS:  I wasn't here in the early going of this, because I actually flew up from St. Louis, Missouri, with Donald Trump on his 757, landed and came here through the horrible Chicago traffic.  Got here just about half an hour before the rally was supposed to start.  It was supposed to start at 6:00 Central Time.  6:00 went by.  6:30 went by.  The crowd seemed to be fairly peaceful, but you could tell that there was some undercurrent going on here.  What's interesting is that when I was flying up with Mr. Trump, he told me we're expecting a huge crowd in Chicago, maybe 25,000, 30,000 people in a building that only holds 10,000.  And I'm getting indications, he told me, that it could be rough.  Now, maybe he was reflexing just on the nature of Chicago politics, looking back at the 1968 in the convention, the big protest that happened during the Democratic convention here in 1996 but -- or he had some intel that maybe from the Secret Service or his advance team that there were a lot of protesters who were in the crowd.  But where we normally see maybe 20, 30 protesters in a large Trump event, there were hundreds of protesters who were embedded in this crowd.  And they knew that once he got up there on the stage, there was going to be some trouble, Megyn.  So, the fact that there were thousands of people still outside, many, many protesters across the street as well, shouting taunts at each other.  The potential for violence was such that the Chicago police obviously got with the Secret Service that went to campaign and said, probably better if we postponed this for another time.  And maybe another venue, because you're here at the University of Illinois.  Obviously, there are a lot of different aspects to the political discourse that goes on here.  It's quite a mosaic of political views.  And if you come back here again to try to do another rally, I expect Megyn that the same thing might just happen all over again.  KELLY:  You know, John, Moveon.org had been encouraging people to show up at some of these rallies and protests as our information.  Is this is this a MoveOn crowd?  Is this a MoveOn crowd because they've been encouraging folks to show up?ROBERTS:  I don't know if it's a MoveOn crowd.  I mean, it could be.  But most of the people here that we've heard from vocally seem to have been Bernie Sanders supporters.  A lot of Black Lives Matter supporters, the Mexican flag there.  So, clearly some folks who have immigration as one of their primary issues.  But you're dealing with a very large student body.  You know that student bodies are very diverse in their political thinking.  There are a lot of people who obviously tilt to the left side of the political fence and they just wanted to make their views known.  And they thought that perhaps in the way that Marisa Johnson, the Black Lives Matter activist in Seattle did when she shut down a Bernie Sanders event in front of a very progressive crowd, this crowd wanted to shutdown Donald Trump's right to free speech, and they certainly have accomplished their goal tonight -- Megyn.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.  And you can see the disappointment on that young man's face John that you interviewed John, talking about how it was just unfair.  I mean, it's not how it's supposed to work.  You want to make your case, you make your case, go for it.  Go for it, don't --   ROBERTS:  Yes.  You know, he was obviously very disappointed.  And people who are exiting the parking garage here, and I think as Jeff Flock pointed out, all the people who are going to this event parked in that garage.  So you have Trump supporters coming out and their cars and the crowd yelling at them.  But this young man, he's clearly -- because he's still over here holding his Donald Trump sign, so he's definitely very firm in his political beliefs, but he was trying to talk to me -- he definitely was getting intimidated by the people behind him.  Well, let's talk to this fellow for a second.  Come on over here.  Come on over here.  You're clearly not in the Trump camp.  What were you here tonight to do?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I would rather not answer that question.  ROBERTS:  That's fine.  Why don't you just answer with your sign?  Trump supporter up here?  Veterans for Trump?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They gave me the sign.  I was a Chris Christie guy.  Before that, I was Ben Carson before they started washing him down.  Too bad.  He was a good man.  ROBERTS:  Both Ben Carson and Chris Christie are with Donald Trump.  So, perhaps by default, were you at the rally tonight?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Couldn't get in.  ROBERTS:  You were one of the people -- one of the thousands of people out here on the streets waiting to get in?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  ROBERTS:  What do you think of the fact that the protesters shut this down tonight?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The beauty of freedom of speech it allows people to reveal what complete imbeciles they are.  ROBERTS:  Hey, hey, let's keep it clean.  All right?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In 1980, Ronald Reagan came to my high school, I was a sophomore, 14, 15-years-old.  As a sophomore in 1980 on Halloween, Reagan came to my high school.  And we got to hear what he had to say.  That's all I wanted to do is hear what he had to say.  We had one protester.  People let the guy talk.  Now you got these little children like this, I don't like you, they won't let me even listen to a guy to see if I want to see what he has to say.  I want to see what he has to say unfiltered by the media, instead of little clips, like when he said about Muslim immigration, he said until we figure out what the hell is going on.  When you turn on news clips, all you hear him say is everything up to that point.  You know, let me just hear it unfiltered.  But instead you have all these people shutting us down.  You can't even listen.  Like I said, I was for Chris Christie and then Ben Carson before that.  ROBERTS:  As you know, clearly Donald Trump is a polarizing figure.  Did you expect to something like this would happen in a place where this rich and diverse opinions -- Chicago?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I didn't think it would be this bad.  But I saw some people on Facebook that friended me, I'm not sure why, they're talking about going here and getting tickets so people wouldn't show up.  They were hoping for an empty hall.  How sad is that?  Just go.  See what he's got to say.  Seek out the opinions you don't like.  Maybe a light will come on, or maybe you're be more reassured if you're right.  Either way, let a person talk.  And instead you have this.  What this country has come to since 1980, when people just let Reagan talk, to this.  ROBERTS:  All right.  Well, thank you for speaking with us.  Young lady, come on over here.  You're making a lot of noise.  Come and talk to me, instead of just yelling and shouting obscenities.  What's your name?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  (INAUDIBLE)And why did you want to shut down the Donald Trump rally tonight?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Because I don't want to give my reasons.  I really don't.  No.  No.ROBERTS:  You just don't want to shut it down, tell us why?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I don't want to give out my reasons.  ROBERTS:  Okay.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  Anybody want to give us the reasons as to why they wanted to shut this down?  All right, no problem.  We'll forgive you.  All right.  Megyn, let's toss it back to you.  ROBERTS:  John, thank you.  We'll be back to you in a moment.  Joining me now by phone, Dr. Ben Carson, one of the man you just heard mentioned, Dr. Ben Carson who endorsed Donald Trump just today.  And Dr. Carson, your reaction to seeing the scenes on the streets of Chicago tonight?DR. BEN CARSON (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (on the phone):  Well, you know, it's very sad that so many particularly of the younger generation are being taught that if you don't like what somebody has to say, you have the right to interfere with their freedom of speech.  This is a very dangerous precedent.  And I think it's probably a place where the media can actually do some good.  They can start talking about, you know, some of our basic freedoms, like freedom of speech and why it's important since they're obviously not being taught that in school.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.  And you know what the other side always says, when we the media or anybody else raises the issue of First Amendment speech in this kind of situation, they talk about their right to protest, and their right to be heard in the manner in which they see fit.  CARSON:  Well, you know, everybody's rights stop at the point where it interferes with someone else's right.  You know, the famous saying, your right to swing your fist stops at my nose.  And so obviously if your expression is shutting down somebody else's planned expression, you're interfering with their rights.  And that's something people need to be taught.  And I don't think that is being taught in a lot of the universities now.  And you see the professors themselves manifesting the same type of intolerance.  And they're teaching that tolerance is only one way, and one direction.  They don't have to extend it to anybody else.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.  Doctor, you know that Donald Trump's critics, well, they're not going to say, they've already said that he invited this, that he has encouraged violence at some of his rallies, he's had harsh language about punching protesters in the face and then yesterday there was very unfortunate incident where one of the attendees at Trump's campaign event punched an African-American man in the face, seemingly unprovoked, and later said he should have killed him.  There is anger about the tenor and tone that we've seen at some of these rallies.  CARSON:  And there's no question that those of us in leadership positions should be attempting to calm people down and teach people to respect each other.  And not encouraging, you know, them in the other direction.  And that's something that we all need to be thinking about.  But it's going to be a huge problem for our country if we don't do something about it now.  A house divided against itself cannot stand.  And I personally believe that, you know, this works in favor of those who want to fundamentally change America.  And the rest of us needs to be thinking about that.  KELLY:  What about that, Dr. Carson?  Because you all along, I mean, this is an interesting dynamic between you and Mr. Trump.  We had political analysts on this show talk about how you were both outsiders, but you were sort of polar opposites.  You know, he's sort of -- he's the big personality and full of bombast and, you know, says things like, punch them in the face.  And you're this gentle soul who was also an outsider but a gentle soul who wanted to calm the conversation down.  I remember once asking, how do you get people to listen to you and you said, talk quieter?  CARSON:  Softly.  KELLY:  Yes, talk softly and try to lower the temperature.  What do you see here as an opportunity for Mr. Trump when it comes to leadership?CARSON:  Well, I think this is a perfect opportunity for him to talk about the fact that this nation is founded on a number of rights, and when we talk about the bill of rights, begin to emphasize that and talk about that, and to indicate that just because you disagree with what someone says, on either side, the right side or the left side, you don't have the right to interfere with their ability to say it.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.CARSON:  And if he starts saying that, and he encourages, you know, Hillary and Bernie to start saying that, and, you know, get it to be a common thing to talk about, I think it will have an effect on the atmosphere.  KELLY:  One interesting thing we're seeing is, this doesn't appear to be all Black Lives Matters protesters or a racial issue.  It seems to be mixed groups --  CARSON:  I don't think what they even know what they're protesting about.  I mean, you saw there a couple of protesters and they asked them, what are you protesting about?  And I don't want to talk about it because I don't think they know.  KELLY:  One does wonder although that was a young, that was a young Hispanic woman who may not have --CARSON:  But there was a man before that -- yes, there was a man before that that said basically the same thing.  KELLY:  And in Trump's defense, we also saw an interview with our own Jeff Flock with a very angry, rude punk who was, you know, swearing on national television, getting right up in the face of a man who was clearly a Trump supporter and antagonizing him.  And you know, clearly whether that's the best ambassador for the brand trying to oppose what they claim is too much anger and too much bombast.  I mean, you see this happen, Dr. Carson, we've seen Black Lives Matter protests under President Obama.  And it just feels like what we're seeing from the electorate this go around is they are angry.  There are so many Americans angry right now.  CARSON:  They are angry.  And it's up to the leadership to take responsibility to give them some perspective and to calm them down.  That's what leaders do.  And that's leaders on both sides have that responsibility.  And if they don't do it, we're going to suffer significant consequences.  It's going to be a long, hot summer, and we don't need that.  And now is the time to be thinking about it.  And now is the time to stop that from occurring.  KELLY:  Yes.  We're looking at Chicago in March.  We're a few months away from Cleveland in July.  CARSON:  Exactly.  KELLY:  We'll see what that brings.  Doctor, great to speak with you. Thank you for joining us tonight.  CARSON:  You too.  Thank you, Megyn.  KELLY:  It's been an extraordinary scene on the streets of Chicago tonight and you tip your caps to the Chicago P.D. which is, much like the NYPD, they know how to handle a crisis the masses and they know how to handle the crises, and they train for it and they're professionals.  And you can see just watching John Roberts' live shot earlier where, you know, the cops were lined up, shoulder to shoulder, the horses were lined up, one after the other.  Managing the crowd.  There you can see some of that on screen left right now.  And it appears that things have settled down.  And there was, these were violent protests.  People were angry and there was some moments of violence.  But not too many, and it's been very well controlled.  I want to tell the audience that we are getting word that Donald Trump may speak momentarily and Ted Cruz may speak momentarily.  They're appearing at an event, at least Cruz is, and Trump possibly maybe.  We're trying to find out whether this initial report is true.  There's a Republican dinner in Rolling Meadows, Illinois, and we are expecting Ted Cruz to speak in moments.  We'll see if he addresses this, as more and more members of this presidential race or participants in this presidential race appear to be weighing in.  You can bet we'll going to hear from Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, who may have a thing or two to say.  They've already -- President Obama has already gone after Donald Trump.  In fact, just tonight he went after Donald Trump and unleashed on him.  Pretty feisty remarks about him tonight.  And so all eyes for the moment are on Donald Trump and how he handles this situation in Chicago where his First Amendment free speech rights have been shut down.  The right of those to listen to him.  And as that one gentleman put it so well, I just wanted to hear him for myself.  Just wanted to hear him for myself.  That was shut down by folks who have an agenda, and that's fine.  You can depose Donald Trump, go for it.  But is this the way?  Is this the way to shut down the ability of Chicagoans and those who have travelled in some cases for miles and miles and waited for hours and hours to get in, to have their say and hear him for themselves, for all these people know they weren't Trump supporters.  Maybe that gentleman would have walked away saying, you know, what?  He's not for me, we'll never know now.  Because they shut down their right to listen to the front-runner on the Republican side.  We saw this not long ago with Ben Shapiro, remember?  He went to a university to talk about free speech.  And what did those who opposed his message do with the university?  They shouted him down loudly, violently, loudly, angrily.  They set off the fire alarm so that he could not be heard.  And so his message, which may have run contrary to that of those on campus, could not be heard although he gave it a hell of a try.  This is what we've seen over and over this year.  Remember, look, look at the anger.  Look at this, the punches being thrown.  You can see the tempers run high.  And Dr. Carson has a strong message for those watching this events, these events and the leaders involved, which is, let's lower the temperature.  Let's lower the temperature.  You know the anger is running hot in this country right now.  On that score, I'm joined right now by Kat Pierson.  Katrina Pierson who is a national campaign spokesperson for Donald Trump.  Katrina, your thoughts on what we're seeing tonight?KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP CAMPAIGN NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON (on the phone):  Hi, Megyn.  You know, all of America can see just how we are losing our country.  As you mentioned, this was an opportunity for Mr. Trump to exercise his free speech, because people who wanted to hear him.  And he was shut down.  And this is interesting more importantly because you see the social media, some of these socialist and anarchists groups who were pushing people to come and attempt to shut this down, the reports of Moveon.org being involved.  And you can see very clearly on the inside where people were Bernie Sanders' supporters.  They were taking other Trump people's signs and ripping them up and throwing them around and honestly, this is what we know from the left.  This is Alinsky rules for radicals on full display.  Ridicule, keeping on the pressure, create the threat, because the threat is more terrifying.  Violence on the other side pushes people to sympathize with you.  You pick your target, freeze it and personalize it, this is exactly how the left operates.  KELLY:  How, you know, to what extent, I asked you about this, which has been brought up elsewhere, to what extent do you believe that Trump's own rhetoric at his rallies and in particular some of the violence we have seen at his rallies, some of the violent clashes with protesters, who often are African-American, has fed into what we are seeing tonight?PIERSON:  Well, Mr. Trump, he has always said that to handle protesters with care in every event that we have from the very beginning --  KELLY:  Wow, Katrina --  PIERSON:  They always say pregame, telling them exactly what to do if there are protesters.  And he has said things just off the cuff.  But nothing serious.  And I got to tell you this, Megyn, Mr. Trump is not responsible for other people's actions.  I mean, as we have mentioned, there are people in this country who are very angry, because they have not been heard.  Their rights have been ignored.  They've been ridiculed by their own president for crying out loud.  How much is that rhetoric pandering into this?  KELLY:  But, you know, that's no excuse for violence.  PIERSON:  Absolutely not.KELLY:  And I mean, Trump has, he has -- he wasn't always joking.  I mean, you can hear him irritated by the protesters at his rallies, and I don't know if we have the sound bite but explicitly saying -- encouraging folks to go after protesters in some situations, saying I'll pay the legal bills, and saying in my day they would have been brought out on a stretcher, you see somebody like that, ""punch them in the face.""  And then what do we see but one protester yesterday which we just showed you on camera punching an African-American protester in the face as the guy was just walking around. I mean, he wasn't offending, he wasn't throwing punches.  PIERSON:  And that also wasn't serious when Mr. Trump said that.  But we don't hear the media coverage though of previous rallies.  There are hundreds of thousands of people that have come to these rallies and we never see when the protesters throw themselves into a crowd of Mr. Trump's people, start swinging, throw themselves on the floor and start thrashing, because they do need organized events to try to create chaos.  This is what we call organized chaos.  A lot of people are already familiar with it. This is something that Americans need to be paying attention to.  Because if we do not stop this issue right now, and elect someone that is going to fight for the freedom of speech and that's going to protect Americans against the will of all of these special interest groups that feed into these socialist and anarchist organizations, we are going to lose our country.  KELLY:  Hmm.  Katrina, thank you.  We're going to stand you by.  We've got much more to get too as you can see.  The streets of Chicago remain, as she put it, chaotic tonight.  And this is not at all what the Trump campaign had in mind, what those 25,000 people who showed up to hear Donald Trump had in mind, although it appears to be very much what MoveOn had in mind and many others who were there to support -- as someone as Bernie Sanders, others who are Republicans who have an objection to Donald Trump.  And what are we seeing on the right side of our screen, is this where we're going to hear Ted Cruz?  Yes.  Okay.  So, we're awaiting Ted Cruz, who was scheduled to make previous -- previous scheduled remarks.  We expect him to comment on this, no doubt.  We'll go there live.  We'll keep our eyes in Chicago.  We'll going to squeeze in a quick break while we wait.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back, everybody. The streets of Chicago in chaos tonight as a Donald Trump rally has been shut down by a large group of protesters who did not want the candidate to speak and who eventually got their way. Here you can see some of the scenes as we watch jubilant protesters cheering their victory at shutting down the rally. Some of Bernie Sanders sign, although it's been all over the place in terms of their ideology. These are not all democrats.There are we're told republicans, there are some Black Lives Matter folks, there are some moveon.org folks who had been encouraging folks to show up at the Donald Trump rallies upset about what they have seen at some of his rallies recently. And then you can see, well, some of the signs; No hate, no racism, no Trump. Some of the remarks Donald Trump made earlier about slow to condemn the KKK and David Duke in how so (ph) it sounded, have upset some of these protesters, and yet many people there are upset of their right to free speech being shut down -- his right to speak and theirs to hear.You can see tensions are running high. Joining me now on the phone is another presidential candidate in this race, and that is Marco Rubio of Florida, who is also looking to pick up some delegates here in the state of Illinois on Tuesday. And this is why they're having rallies here is because Illinois is one of the states that will vote on Super Tuesday. Senator Rubio, thank you for joining us by phone. Your thoughts on what we're seeing in Chicago.  MARCO RUBIO, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, it's a very disturbing night for a lot of reasons. First, let me just take a moment and tell -- thank the police department in Chicago there. Tonight is a reminder that our men and women who serve in the police departments, in law enforcement are always on the front line with dealing with all these problems. Second, let me say that it is clear. Look, this is Chicago. Protesters are an industry. It is clear just from watching some of these images that this was an organized effort, an orchestrated effort on the part of groups that wanted to disrupt an event, and then Chicago is kind of a hub for that kind of activity, there's no doubt about it.I would also say that, you know, people have a right, whether you disagree with someone what they're about to say and I most certainly disagree with many of the things that Donald Trump says and it's for I'm running against him for president. But you don't have a right to take away the first amendment right of people to speak freely. I think you've seen some of this on college campuses recently. There was an article not long ago, I think that Ben Shapiro tried to speak on a campus.They basically shut him down. So, I think this is kind of crossing over into the broader society and it's problematic. I will say no one is blameless here. Perhaps I wouldn't say Mr. Trump is responsible for the events of tonight, but he most certainly in other events has in the past used some pretty rough language and encouraging the crowd, you know, saying things like, ""in the good old days we used to beat these people up,"" or ""I'll pay your legal bills if you rough them up.""So, I think he bears some responsibility for the general tone of the things that are happening. As far as what's happening tonight, I mean clearly, this is an orchestrated effort by people, some of them are probably being paid to do this and I think it's just sad all the way around to see these images where, you know, it clearly -- there's some level of ethnic and racial divide in how this is playing out on television. I just think it reflects very poorly on our country. I think it's sad all the way around tonight, I really do. I'm very sad for our country.KELLY: When, you know, when you make reference to Mr. Trump's language -- you know a lot of people think it's funny. They think that's kind of funny the stuff he says, like ""oh, punch him in the face."" You know, like these people are irritating, they're trying to disrupt the rallies, he's had enough. People show up now to his rallies with signs that they've already written out that read ""Get them out"" because that's what Trump always says, ""get them out"" and then sometimes he adds some more colorful language.RUBIO: Yeah, see the thing is though, when you want to be president -- look, one of the appeals of Donald Trump I believe is that he says what a lot of people wish they could say but it's not politically correct to say or it's not polite to say. And he says -- he says it on a big platform and people love it, cathartic. The problem is that when you're going to be president of the United States or when you're running for president or when you are president, you can't just say whatever you want.These words have real consequences. Donald Trump has a big platform right now. He's the frontrunner in the Republican Party and everybody is paying attention to what he's saying and these words have consequences -- when you're president even more so. Again, I want to be clear. I am not telling you that what happened there tonight is something I blame him for because I will tell you that those people that are there are professional protesters, in an array of different interest groups.I guarantee you some of these people are being paid to do this, and you can see it just in the interviews afterwards as well. But I am saying he does bear responsibility for some of the other things that have happened at his events including people being punched in the face, allegedly a reporter also being roughed up the other day. I think there's blame to go around here and I think it reflects -- we are entering a kind of a very disturbing moment in our political discourse in this country that is reaching a boiling point that I believe has very significant repercussions, not just for this election, but for the future of this country.We are being ripped apart at the seams as a nation and as a people right now. And I think the president bears some blame for that as well in terms of some of the rhetoric reviews. You see some of it reflected on college campuses as well.KELLY: How do you think this portends for the 2016 race, both the primaries on Tuesday and the republican race and then the general election in November?RUBIO: I don't know. I haven't given it thought and to me quite frankly, that is something very -- I think the bigger issue is what's happening in America right now. Look, there's real significant anger and frustration at the direction of our country. People feel every major institution has let them down, the media, academia, organized religion, the political parties, the political process. People are hurting and they're upset and they're angry. And I think it's the job of leaders not to stoke that anger, but to use that anger and channel it in a way that allows us to reach solutions as opposed to stoke that anger in a way that drives us to a political victory on a given election year.You know, the president flirted with this himself. I mean, President Obama has spent the last eight years dividing Americans along haves and have-nots, along ethnic lines, racial lines, gender lines in order to win elections. I think this has gone to the next level here and you know, we're seeing the consequences of it and that, in combination with the fact that, you know, I think there's a need to remind people that the first amendment allows people to disagree with issues and say things you don't agree with, which obviously is just being lost here. And then this sort of sense now on the left that if you don't like what someone is saying, you have the right to just shut them down as you see happen on many college campuses across America and you saw tonight there in Chicago.KELLY: It will be interesting to hear more from Trump, he who has defended some of his fans at times violent behavior by saying they're very angry, you know, they're very angry. And it is clear that some of the people protesting this rally tonight and what Trump has said and what he stands for, they are very angry, too. And you know there's a question about how they should be responded to. Senator Rubio, so glad you could join us. Thank you for being here tonight.RUBIO: Thank you.KELLY: Joining me now with more, another republican candidate for president, Ted Cruz -- no, I'm sorry. Hold on. He's speaking live. Let's listen to him.TED CRUZ, PRESIDENTIAL CANIDATE: We will have a respectful, substantive, issues-based discussion. But we can have differences in terms of how to turn this country around. We have genuine and real differences in this country, but we can do so in a way that appeals to our better angels instead of our worst instincts that seeks to pull us together and unite us instead or tear us apart. You know, we've seen for seven years a president who often at times of crisis has sought to divide us -- sought to divide us on racial and ethnic lines, on religious lines, on class lines.America's better than this. We don't have to tear each other apart. Instead, we can work together for positive, proactive solutions to the real problems facing this country. Americans want jobs. We want our wages going up. We want opportunity again for young people. And we ought to be having a positive, meaningful discussion about what policies will expand opportunities for the next generation to achieve the American dream. With that, I'd be happy to answer some questions.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible)CRUZ: I think the decision should be based on public safety. But I think a campaign bears responsibility for creating an environment, when the candidate urges supporters to engage in physical violence to punch people in the face. The predictable consequence of that is that it escalates and today is unlikely to be the last such instance. We saw earlier today in St. Louis over 30 arrested. That's not how our politics should occur.You know, the city of Chicago in 1968 saw some ugly days when politics descended into hatred and instability and even violence. And it is my hope that in 2016 that we can appeal to our better angels and avoid going down that road once again.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible)CRUZ: You know, at the end of the day, finding Donald Trump's policies is a difficult endeavor...(LAUGHTER)... because Donald speaks of problems. He speaks about jobs going overseas, but when asked for a policy to fix it, he has yet to propose one. Other than his magic cure-all of negotiate better deals -- we'll have better deals to solve every problem. You know, I don't think that is a meaningful solution to the problems we're facing. I think we need economic policies to bring jobs back, to bring wages up. My campaign has from day one been focused on substance and issues and policies.How do we fix the economy? We fix the economy by lifting the burdens on small businesses, because 2/3 of all new jobs come from small businesses. And we do that through repealing ObamaCare, through pulling back the federal regulators that are making it harder and harder for small businesses to survive. And we do that through passing a simple flat tax and abolishing the IRS. Those are meaningful policies that will bring back ...(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Look, today what I'm focused on is an appeal to civility in the democratic discourse. You know, it was nice last night at the debate, that the debate did not feature the candidates insulting each other, making derogatory comments about each other's physical appearance, about their body parts, about spray tans. But that's not what politics is supposed to be about. Politics at the end of the day is not about any of the candidates. It's not about me, it's not about Donald, it's not about Hillary or Bernie. It's about you. It's about the American people. It's about our kids. It's about our future of this country.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senator, why is Illinois important on Tuesday? Specifically Illinois.CRUZ: You know Illinois is tremendously important on Tuesday. Tuesday is a big election, it's a big election nationwide and I tell you Illinois is a battleground. Right now, here in the state of Illinois, Donald Trump and I are running neck and neck. We are effectively tied. And we are campaigning hard. We are campaigning hard for support here in Illinois. This race has now become a two-man race. There are only two candidates that have any credible path to becoming the republican nominee.It takes 1,237 delegates to become the republican nominee. I have 361. Donald has 460 and 99 more than I do. Nobody else is remotely close. And Illinois will be allocating delegates and it's allocated by congressional district, this is a battle delegate by delegate by delegate. We intend to earn 1,237 delegates, and beat Donald Trump, not at a convention, but beat Donald Trump at the ballot box. And Illinois is going to have a critical choice.If you are an Illinois republican and you don't think Donald Trump is the best choice to go head-to-head with Hillary Clinton, if you recognize as 65 to 70 percent of republicans do, that Donald Trump loses to Hillary Clinton, then I encourage you to unite behind our campaign, because our campaign is the only campaign that can beat Donald Trump for the republican nomination. Indeed, we're the only campaign that...(APPLAUSE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you urging the voters of Ohio to support and vote for John Kasich because if Kasich doesn't win and Trump does, you're dead?CRUZ: I am not remotely. I am urging the voters of Ohio and Florida and Illinois and Missouri and North Carolina -- I'm urging the voters of all the state -- I started with Ohio, that's the first one I list -- I'm urging the voters of all of those states to vote for me, to beat Donald Trump. This is not a game. It's not a game of playing back and forth. This is an election that will be decided by the people and at this point, you know, there are folks in Washington, the Washington establishment is salivating at the prospect of a brokered convention where they try to parachute in some Washington establishment choice, because they don't like what the voters have done.I think that would be catastrophic. I think that would truly cause a revolt among the voters. If you want to beat Donald Trump, and trust me, I want to beat Donald Trump because I think if he's the nominee we lose to Hillary Clinton and we lose the Supreme Court for a generation. We lose the bill of rights. If you want to beat Donald Trump, the way to beat him is at the ballot box. And at this point, our campaign has beaten him not once, not twice, not three times, but eight separate times all across this country from coast to coast, literally from Alaska to Maine. We have beaten Donald Trump over and over and over again.And so we are working hard to earn the votes of the men and women of Illinois, the men and women of Ohio and all across this country. We are running a national campaign in every state and if you were supporting another candidate, you know, a year ago we started out with 17 candidates. It was a wonderful, rich, diverse, talented field. And yet the field has narrowed. That's the way the primary process works.Maybe before you were supporting some other candidate. Maybe it was Jeb Bush or Chris Christie. Maybe you were supporting Rand Paul or Mike Huckabee. Maybe you're supporting Ben Carson or Carly Fiorina or maybe now you're thinking about supporting Marco Rubio or John Kasich. Every one of them are good, honorable, decent people. They're people who I like and respect and yet none of them have any path to beating Donald Trump.And so, if you're a voter here in Illinois and you do not want to see Donald Trump as the nominee, I ask you to join us even if you were supporting another candidate. Come, let's stand together, and unite. We will have a campaign that is focused on issues and policy and substance that lays out a vision, a vision for America of jobs, of freedom, of security. A vision of America that raises wages for everyone who is struggling.A vision of America where the president doesn't do the bidding of the special interests and the lobbyists in Washington, but instead fights as I have done every day, for the hard-working taxpayers, for the working men and women of this country who have been left behind. We will bring back morning in America if only we stand together.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Ted Cruz making clear that candidates do bear some responsibility for what happens at their events. Pointing out that earlier today in Missouri at a Trump rally, 30 people were arrested and we have seen growing unrest at many of these events. I want to get right to Chris Stirewalt and Barry Bennett  who have been waiting -- who came in tonight in our D.C. bureau to comment on what we are seeing here. Chris, let me start with you as, you know, the guy that knows more about politics than anybody I've ever known. What's going on? What's going on here?CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NES DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, what's going on is probably pretty predictable which is that Donald Trump has fired up people and that the people who take a different point of view gotten fired up on their own part. I think in the short term what you will see will be beneficial to Trump in the sense that -- and you see the pictures of the Trump bros who are there and they've got their cell phones out. They came to see the show. They want to see the fight.They want to see the action. His rallies promise those fights. His rallies promise that violence. It is an enticement for people who want to feel that fire. And i think probably in the short term for his supporters this is an enticement and it says that they're against us and they're rioting against us and we're for it. Then the question is, and this is the more significant question for his campaign, when you hear what Senator Rubio says, when you hear what Senator Cruz says and republicans think, do we want to do this until November? Do we want to have it this way?For Trump's core supporters who believe in his message and believe in him and came to see the show and you punch him and you hit him and you do whatever you have to do. When they swing at you, you swing back said Trump today or yesterday. For the people that want that, this is going to fire them up more, they're going to want it more. It's going to intensify but the republicans have to ask themselves, is this what they want to do until November?KELLY: What do you think, Barry? I mean, the question is whether these rallies are becoming a powder keg to the danger of those present.BARRY BENNETT, INFORMAL ADVISOR TRUMP CAMPAIGN: Well, what we saw tonight were, you know, several hundred organized protesters -- probably professional protesters-- who rushed an auditorium and took the stage because they all believed that their free speech is more important than ours. And, you know, I think that's disgusting but it happens on college campuses every day. You know? I mean, we hear stories even in Washington of Pentagon officials being kept out of universities, you know, reporters and authors being kept out of universities and shutted down by the left who they say they're for free speech but they're not.They're only for their speech. And I think, you know, we can't allow this to happen. You know, both sides have to understand that you're entitled to your own ideas and if those ideas enflame you, then hold a press conference, write a book. Start a blog. But don't go in and try to silence other people. I mean, that's what we're seeing tonight. And you know, I just heard Marco Rubio say that we need to be more politically correct which, goodness gracious, that's the scariest thing I've heard a republican candidate say all year long.KELLY: But Barry, I mean I think he is talking about, you know, about the comments we've been discussing like punch him in the face. Punch him in the face. Take him out on a stretcher. Do you?BENNET: These guys, they didn't come for that reason. These guys came because they don't believe that we should build a wall. They don't believe we should secure our borders. They don't believe in any of the things that conservative republicans believe in. That's why they came.KELLY: I think that's probably right. Don't you think that's probably right, Chris? It's not that these protesters showed up because of that language. It's just that that language can gin up the pre-existing anger of those already in attendance at the Trump rallies.STIREWALT: I think if you used the same language that you use for a World Wrestling Entertainment match, if you used the same Smackdown talk then protesters know that they can come get on camera because they  can become part of the show. Right? So, Donald Trump makes the protesters part of the show. He says, come and see. Come and see the beatings. Come and see the fighting. Come and do it because he plays it up. He likes to talk about it.He used to work with professional wrestling and he uses the same kind of language and then people come. Then we would not be surprised when protesters, when you turn all the cameras on with every cable network, with every channel and everybody is tuned right in and Donald Trump says, violence and you will see fighting, and you will see beatings, and it will be intense and don't be surprised at that point, especially in Chicago, Illinois, for god's sake, of any city in America that you would see protests show up and say, let's do it. Let's have the row-sham-bow.KELLY: In Trump's defense, he even last night at the debate, he tried to soften that message. He tried to acknowledge the anger of those who show up at his rallies and those who support him and said that he doesn't want it to end in violence for either side as he put it. You know, we've seen a couple of events. I mean, tonight, we had an extensive and exclusive interview of Michelle Fields who is a reported for Breitbart, which is a pro-Trump website and she claims that she was assaulted by Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski and actually filed a criminal complaint against him down in Florida today and video has emerged of what appears to be the incident which we had teed up for you.We're not going to get to that tonight given what's happening, but we will show it to you perhaps on Monday we'll do that. But there have been more and more things and you heard Ted Cruz reference that or Marco Rubio reference it earlier tonight. I want to stand you guys by because we've got Rich Lowry who's on the phone. Rich, I know that, you know, you are the editor of National Review and you -- National Review came out against Trump and actually just endorsed Ted Cruz. It seems tough to pin this on Donald Trump, however, as a political matter when we've seen so much anger in the country boiling over for at least the past year.RICH LOWRY, EDITOR NATIONAL REVIEW: Yeah, well, the first thing and most important thing to say about this is that it's wrong in a free society to disrupt and shut down a political rally. Period. Full stop. This is a mob. There's no other word for it and it's disgusting. But I have to say, you know, this is just one event. You don't want overdramatic about it but you begin to get the feeling there's something irreparable that's breaking in our political culture.KELLY: What is it? And what do we do about it?LOWRY: We're just so polarized. We're so racializeda -- to see black and white people shoving and punching people at this event. It's just so ugly and so depressing. And there's no healer or uniter on the horizon.KELLY: Well, there was. I mean, I will say that that was the message brought by Ben Carson, who wound up getting rejected by the voters. John Kasich tries to offer that message but hasn't gain traction in the race. You know, the electorate seems to be going the different way.LOWRY: Yeah, and Trump has benefited most because he has played in a very real passion out there. And he thrives on the polarization and we'll see it after this event. If anyone thought that Donald Trump was dominating the media prior to this, just wait until the wall to wall coverage of him this weekend and it's very likely he's going to benefit from it and if there's some significant percentage of republicans who look at this and understandably are disgusted by it and react against it and go and vote for Trump when they wouldn't have necessarily on Tuesday and Trump is now a martyr to free speech, that could be a decisive impact on this race.KELLY: How do you see this playing out in November? Let's say this goes forward. You know, you've got Trump who was, you know, make America great again and then you got Hillary with Make America whole again. He's out there acknowledging he's angry and so are his supporters. She's out there saying we need more love. So how does this -- if she and he become the respective nominees, where does this kind of thing go?LOWRY: Well, it is just going to be a highly charged and highly negative trade. And you look at George w. Bush in 2000 and Barack Obama in 2008, both of them were fresh and new on the national stage. And both of their electoral appeal was based partly on not being hated by the other side. Not being threatening to the other side. George w. Bush sold himself as a compassionate conservative.Barack Obama, it's easy to forget now, but sold himself as a moderate pragmatist in 2008. Neither Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, if he's the nominee, are going to be able to do that. They're both highly polarizing figures. Their unfavorable ratings are off the charts. So, if it's the two of them, it will be one of the most negative and ugly campaigns in American history.KELLY: And on that note, Rich, thank you. Thank you for calling in.Lowry: Thanks so much.KELLY: Think about -- think about where we are right now as a country. 2008, Barack Obama ran on a platform of hope and change. He was the one who was going to go to Washington and change the culture there and unite the country. There is no blue America. There is no red America.He expressed it at the State of the Union one of his regrets was language that was too divisive and that he hadn't made good on that promise of hope and change and here we sit March of 2016 as Rich put it, black versus white, democrat versus republican, republican versus republican. And on it goes into the election season. My friend Sean Hannity is up. He has Trump. Stay tuned.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

That comes on the heels of the House Armed Services Committee report yesterday that says the same thing but went a bit further. The House says then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and the head of the joint chiefs of staff, General Martin Dempsey, both label the attack a terrorist action and Panetta told President Obama that on the day the attack happened 9/11.So, now, we have a major situation, but the president still has not commented on the latest reports.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Why, if these military leaders testified to Capitol Hill that they knew it was an attack, almost immediately, why did you continue --(CROSSTALK)JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: -- two things. First of all, of course it was an attack. The facility was attacked there was never any doubt about -- come on, Ed. I know there is a desire here to --(CROSSTALK)CARNEY: This is just not factual. Of course it was an attack. It was an attack that led to the deaths of four Americans.(END VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: Another dodge by White House spokesman Jay Carney.The Senate Intelligence report out today also says the terror attack on Ambassador Stevens and other Americans could have been prevented because the CIA told the State Department under Hillary Clinton that the security situation in Benghazi in Libya in general was getting much worse. Yet, the State Department did not, did not beef up security, even though it was warned. Again, according to the Senate report out today.Now, all of this should trouble every loyal American and politics should not be a part of it. We need the federal government to be proactive in protecting Americans from terrorists. And ironically that's what the National Security Agency is supposed to do but the NASA may be overdoing it.New information again out today says that the NASA has tapped into computers, all over the world to track terrorists. That has led to yet another outcry against a massive spying apparatus, the Obama administration has in place. Somehow the president has to sort all of this out, in a very clear and concise manner.We, the people, need to know why the world was mislead about Benghazi and we need to know what the NASA is allowed to and what it should never do, and we need to know these things now. And that's ""The Memo."""

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ERIC BOLLING, GUEST HOST:  Welcome to a special edition ""Hannity: Clinton Corruption, the Lynch-Clinton Scandal.""I'm Eric Bolling, in for Sean tonight. After igniting a political firestorm by meeting with Bill Clinton while the FBI investigates Hillary Clinton's email server scandal, Attorney General Loretta Lynch is now trying to assure Americans that the criminal probe will be fair and impartial.  Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LORETTA LYNCH, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES:  As I've always indicated, the matter is being handled by career agents and investigators with the Department of Justice.  They will make recommendations as to how to resolve what those facts lead to.The recommendations will be reviewed by career supervisors in the Department of Justice and in the FBI, and by the FBI director.  And then, as is the common process, they present it to me, and I fully expect to accept their recommendations.JONATHAN CAPEHART, WASHINGTON POST:  You're on your plane, and in walks the former president of the United States.  What were you thinking at that moment?(LAUGHTER)LYNCH:  Well, as I've said, you know, he said, Hello, and we -- we basically said, Hello.  And I congratulated him on his grandchildren, as people tend to do.I may have viewed it in a certain light, but the issue is how does it impact the work that I do and the work that the Department of Justice does? And I certainly wouldn't do it again.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING:  And last night on Fox News, the reporter who broke this story, ABC's (INAUDIBLE) Christopher Sign, dropped this bombshell about the Clinton-Lynch tarmac meeting.  Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRISTOPHER SIGN, ARIZONA REPORTER:  They then make the decision -- ""they"" meaning the president's team, the former president's team -- they wait for her to land.  She arrives.  Some people step off of her plane.  The former president steps into her plane.They then speak for 30 minutes privately, the FBI there on the tarmac instructing everybody around, no photos, no pictures, no cell phones.  He then gets off the plane, gets on his own plane.  He departs.  She continues on with her planned visit.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING:  Here now with reaction are the chief counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice Jay Sekulow, the president of Judicial Watch, Tom Finton, and my fellow co-host of ""The Five"" Kimberly Guilfoyle.Jay, sounds like she's a little complicit in this.  If you listen to the laughter, you listen to her, she's an innocent bystander.  Oh, yes, we crossed paths.  Did they cross paths innocently?JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE:  Well, no, they didn't -- first of all, this was not like they ran into each other in the FBO (ph) or in the terminal.  This was -- someone had an intentional meeting.And at the end of the day, no matter how that meeting was arranged, the attorney general of the United States, who is the chief law enforcement officer, who is investigating criminally Hillary Clinton -- Bill Clinton could well be a witness if not a defendant himself -- she allows the former president of the United States on her aircraft.How that was arranged -- irrelevant.  It reeks of impropriety, the attorney general today trying to basically talk her way out of what is clearly a breach of trust to the American people, an unethical action on behalf of the attorney general, and laughing about it that they were talking about grandchildren.This is not funny.  This is the chief law enforcement officer of the United States.  She's violating the internal rules of professional conduct within the Department of Justice.  Look, I was a government lawyer.  I understand the rules.  She understands the rules.  She violated them.BOLLING:  K.G., Jay points out it reeks of impropriety, but -- and the legal standard backs him up.  It says -- the legal standard being to disqualify a party in a case, not just impropriety itself, but the appearance of impropriety, right?KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST ""THE FIVE"":  Yes.  So that's a very low threshold, when you think about it.  And this is significant because it does show that there was some contemplation.  There was a meeting of the minds, so to speak.  It wasn't a quick, casual, How are the grandkids these days?  You know, I guess a little bit more of a substantial conversation. She refers to it as primarily about family stuff and grandkids.But I mean, she should know better.  He certainly knows better.  And this is part of the deal, you know, with the Clintons.  They have this way of exerting their influence, whether it's through a conversation like that, a face-to-face.I mean, Bill Clinton is certainly someone who could be also called in this investigation since the back half of the investigation against Hillary Clinton is about the improprieties of the global Clinton Foundation, money accepted from other countries, et cetera.So this is very improper.  It's not just about his wife's e-mail server because this is a two-pronged investigation, and he's certainly a part of it.BOLLING:  They want transparency.  Hillary has a lack of -- I'll give you some transparency.  They believe they're above the law.  They're always doing this type of thing!Hey, Tom, is this part -- did Loretta Lynch say that she's going to come out and -- well, she didn't exactly say she will absolutely, definitely take the FBI recommendation.  She say she would fully expect to take it. However, she says she will.  The timing of it -- did she do this because we're hearing reports that the FBI agents on this case are furious?TOM FINTON, JUDICIAL WATCH:  Well, they ought to be furious because she made fools of them all, that this witness and potential subject of an investigation just bypassed the whole system and met with the boss, the one making the decision in the end.By her own admission, she's still going to make the decision in the end as to whether to accept -- she says she'll fully expect to accept it.  But that's no guarantee, and frankly I wouldn't expect her to guarantee a certain result without knowing what the result -- what the facts are going to be.Look, she blew up this investigation, and I don't really know how to fix it.  But she blew it up, and there's got to be consequences.  That's why we asked for an IG investigation.Eric, we had testimony this week from Huma Abedin, Mrs. Clinton's top aide, one of her top aides at the State Department.  She said she called up Justin Cooper, Bill Clinton's employee, to get her e-mail address on the Clinton e-mail server that was set up by Bill Clinton employee.  The e-mail server supposedly was in Bill Clinton's home, in his basement.  And this man is meeting with the attorney general?BOLLING:  Right, right.FINTON:  This Justice Department, by the way, is a disaster.  They've been in court, by the way, defending Hillary Clinton's use of this e-mail system while prosecutors supposedly are criminally investigating it!BOLLING:  Jay, talk to us about this theory or this feeling, Oh, you know, it was just a meeting (INAUDIBLE) or pat on the back or someone describe -- James over here described it -- hey, it's kind of -- it's almost like the ""Sopranos"" style of, Oh, let's just meet for a minute, talk about the kids, with a wink.GUILFOYLE:  Right.SEKULOW:  Well, here's the thing.  I mean, first of all, I think this thing's a faux investigation.  I mean, at the end of the day -- not that the FBI is not trying to do their job and James Comey trying to do their job.  But what the attorney general did today or this week was sabotage that investigation, exactly what Tom and Kim said.  It sabotaged it. That's number one.Number two, it's the ministry (ph) of presence.  Bill Clinton's presence on that aircraft, a government aircraft controlled by the United States of America, sends a signal.  They may have talked about their kids or his golf game.  It does not matter!  It's his conduct, not what his heart was, not what her heart was, not her emotions, how she felt about her grandchildren. Doesn't matter!She is the chief law enforcement officer of the United States, and she allows on that aircraft, as the staff leave, purportedly, and has conversations with someone that could well be, if not is, a target, direct target of this investigation!Eric, let me take it one step further.  She needs to go!  She certainly should have recused herself.  She did not.  She should then resign.  If she doesn't, the president should fire her.(CROSSTALK)SEKULOW:  This is the attorney general of the United States.  She's not acting like an attorney or a general, frankly.BOLLING:  K.G., President Clinton appointed Loretta Lynch.GUILFOYLE:  Yes.BOLLING:  Should he fire her?GUILFOYLE:  Well, yes, right, I'm sure.  It seems like he was definitely sending a shot across the bow, face to face Clinton-style to exert influence.But listen, this isn't even a close call for me.  She should recuse herself, and I say this as a former officer of the court.  I'm a former prosecutor.  And I'll tell you, if we ever had the audacity to try and have an ex parte communication with a judge or a member of a jury, you would be in huge trouble.  It is highly improper.  It's not a close call.  She knows better.  He knows better as an attorney.And there's already some impropriety in the fact that he has appointed her before, and yet she's supposed to impartially investigate not only his wife but his foundation?  I mean, come on!  He's certainly the subject that they would want to talk to, as well, as this proceeds forward.  That's why the FBI is furious!BOLLING:  Hey, Tom, I only have a few seconds here.  Tell us about the timing of Loretta Lynch's statement, Friday before a long weekend.  They tend to do these things because they know the news cycle kind of gets buried with the weekend news, with the holiday.GUILFOYLE:  Fourth of July.FINTON:  I mean, it's an attempt to squelch the story, and it's not going to work.  You know, one of the reasons we have these rules is to prevent this situation from occurring, this blowing up of the investigation.GUILFOYLE:  Exactly.FINTON:  Arguably, you know, this woman now is a witness in the case.(CROSSTALK)SEKULOW:  I'd move to recuse her from the case if I was the defense lawyers, frankly.  I mean, this -- the whole -- one other thing, Eric.  If Kim did this, Tom did it, or I did it, we could be disbarred.BOLLING:  All right, we got to leave it right there, guys.GUILFOYLE:  True.BOLLING:  We got a lot more show coming up on this special edition of ""Hannity."" Thank you, all three, very much.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  When I first heard the story, I said, No, no, you're kidding.  I don't believe that.  I thought somebody was joking.  But it's not a joke.  It's not a joke.  It's a very serious thing.  And to have a thing like that happen is so sad.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING:  Donald Trump is slamming the Clintons over Bill's private airport meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch.  Former governor Mike Huckabee is here next with reaction.And later, Loretta Lynch says she will not recuse herself from the Clinton e-mail investigation despite growing calls to do so.That and more as this special edition of ""Hannity"" continues.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)BOLLING:  Welcome back to this special edition of ""Hannity: Clinton Corruption, the Lynch-Clinton Scandal.""Earlier today, White House press secretary Josh Earnest made it clear that President Obama is playing no role in the Justice Department's probe into Hillary Clinton's private server.  Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  I will leave it to the attorney general to describe the role that she will play and the process that the Department of Justice will undertake as they conduct this investigation. The president's expectation is that this investigation will be handled just like all the others.  He believes that this matter should be handled without regard to politics.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING:  Meanwhile, Donald Trump blasted Attorney General Lynch's meeting with former president Clinton during a speech earlier today.  Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Bill Clinton goes in the other day, into an airplane, just happened to be -- oh, just a coincidence, you know.  He just happened to be at the airport at this time. Think of it, just happened to be at the airport.You know, when I first heard the story, I said, No, No, you're kidding.  I don't believe it.  I thought somebody was joking.  But it's not a joke. It's not a joke.  It's a very serious thing.  And to have a thing like that happen is so sad.And as you know, Hillary is so guilty.  She's so guilty.  I mean, you can read them right off here.  And how that's not being pursued properly -- and I think that he really -- I think he really opened it up.  He opened up a Pandora's box.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING:  Joining me now is former 2015 GOP presidential candidate and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee.  Huck, what is going on with these Democrats?  Are they all corrupt?MIKE HUCKABEE, R-FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Well, I mean, that's too easy a question to answer, Eric.  But let me tell you, the biggest fireworks show in America this weekend is going to be wherever Bill and Hillary get together and sit down and have a conversation about this because I have a feeling that Hillary is going to light Bill up over this meeting.My guess is she didn't know he was going to do this, and when she found out, she was livid because this makes her look bad, makes Bill look bad, makes Loretta Lynch look bad.  Nobody looks good in this thing.It is a political gift, however, in that it does now call attention to what many people will certainly believe is nothing less than an insider's game and the kind of corruption that is just making people furious and driving them to Donald Trump.BOLLING:  Huck, I'm trying to figure -- I gamed this out all day long.  I'm trying to figure out why Loretta Lynch today decided to make the statement about wanting to agree with whatever the FBI comes forth, what they present her, because the way it works is the FBI presents the information, Loretta Lynch decides to indict, call a grand jury or not.And I'm wondering if maybe they were going to say, You know what?  No indictment.  Not enough there.  And then she's trying to put it on the FBI before that, knowing that this meeting occurred and the world is going to say, Well, wait a minute.  If there's no indictment, it's because of the meeting.HUCKABEE:  Well, I think that she put herself in a box.  This is twice in the last couple of weeks.  Once was after Orlando, when the heavily redacted statement where all of the references were taken away from jihad, and then they had to go back and put them back in and admit maybe they had taken out too much.  And now this.In both cases, it looks like huge missteps by the attorney general just not reading the cards right.  And I think that's what's happened.Now, what she's done by saying, Oh, look, I'll take whatever the FBI deals out -- she essentially is saying, Don't blame me if Hillary gets indicted. And I'm not but sure that deep down in the bowels of the White House, there would be some celebration if Hillary did get indicted because guess what that means?  Let's bring in good old Uncle Joe and bring him in to save the Democratic Party.BOLLING:  Or does Bernie Sanders dust off the old campaign playbook and say, all of a sudden, it's overtime, I got another shot here?HUCKABEE:  Yes, suddenly, he cares about her e-mails.  I get it.(LAUGHTER)HUCKABEE:  But look, I do think that Loretta Lynch has put herself in a very tough spot.  Let's just assume for a moment that Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch did nothing but socialize for a half an hour on that airplane.  Maybe that's true.But the perception of it stinks to high heaven.  It smells worse than potato salad that sat out for a week past the 4th of July.And I think the other thing we have to just acknowledge is that a huge, big mistake was when the FBI and the various staff members around them said, No photos.  You can't take a picture.I'm sorry, it's a public-owned airplane in a public space.  And the authorities cannot say to people, You're not allowed to photograph a publicly owned, financed airplane in a public place unless there's some national security concern, and I cannot for the life of me imagine what that would be.BOLLING:  Let's talk a little politics here.  So there's a chance that Bill Clinton was just thinking, Hey, you know, this is the way we do business in D.C. all the time.  This is old school politics.  Trump has run on, I'm different.  I'm not one of them.  I want to run the country differently. Maybe there's an opportunity, an opening, for Donald Trump to use this and exploit it.HUCKABEE:  Well, I think that there really is.  It is the way -- I mean, politicians, despite all of the -- sometimes the rancor, there is sort of a camaraderie.  And I'm talking about even between -- let's say when I was in office or when I was a candidate, with other candidates who were my opponents.We'd have kind moments, and I've bumped into people at airports and events, and you'd have nice words.  And I understand all of that.  And for Bill Clinton, who's probably one of the most gregarious people that anyone has ever met, it is not uncommon that Bill Clinton would have a conversation or that it would last a while.But what makes this different is that it is in the context of an active investigation about his wife, and so the appearance of it is just absolutely off.  And that's why I say I think Hillary is going to rip him a new one this weekend, if, in fact, they get in the same room.BOLLING:  Mike, he can't get away with saying, Oh, I didn't know.  He's a very, very smart man.HUCKABEE:  Right.  Listen, this guy -- you got to remember, he's a Yale- educated attorney.  He was attorney general of Arkansas.  Then he was governor for 11 years.  Then he was president of the United States.  You know, he was a law professor.I think for him to pretend like, Well, I had no idea that I wasn't supposed to do that -- that's ludicrous.  I mean, that is absolutely an indefensible statement on his part.  Even though he lost his law license or voluntarily gave it up after the Whitewater and all the other investigations involving Monica Lewinsky, it's not like he forgot that much of what being a lawyer is about.  Heck, I don't even have a law license, and I know better than that.BOLLING:  All right, we're going to leave it right there.  Huck, thank you so much.Coming up, Loretta Lynch refuses to recuse herself from the Justice Department's investigation into Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server. What political implications will this have?Plus, it's scandals like this that make voters not trust Hillary Clinton. You won't believe the percentage of voters who don't think she's honest or trustworthy.  Well, you may.  But stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LORETTA LYNCH, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES:  A recusal would mean I wouldn't even be briefed on what the findings were or what the actions going forward would be.  And while I don't have a role in those findings, in coming up with those findings or making those recommendations as to how to go forward, I'll be briefed on it, and I will be accepting their recommendations.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING:  That was Attorney General Loretta Lynch earlier today explaining why she will not recuse herself from the Hillary Clinton e-mail server investigation.  But given the fact that she displayed such horrible judgment by even talking to Bill Clinton, should she resign or be fired?Joining us now from The Washington Times, Charles Hurt, Fox News contributor Jedediah Bila and former Clinton pollster and Fox News contributor Doug Schoen.Charles, what do you think?  Look, if she -- she says she's not going to recuse herself.  Should she?  And if she doesn't, would it be advisable for President Obama to say, Time to leave?CHARLES HURT, FOX CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, it's absolutely incredible.  And you're talking about somebody who has a very good reputation prior to this as a prosecutor and as an attorney.  This is a very serious person.And how it is that she got pulled into this Clinton vortex, I -- I just find it absolutely unfathomable.  But whether she does or does not recuse herself at this point is almost a sort of a moot point because, of course, Bill Clinton is not just the wife of the person being investigated.He's a material witness, and he is an integral part of the investigation because so much of the investigation involved the e-mails between the secretary of state, the State Department, and the Clinton Foundation, of which he's the head.  That's the part that I -- I still can't get my head around that.BOLLING:  Yes.  And Doug, what I can't get my head around is she's the top law enforcement officer in the country.  She should know better, right?DOUG SCHOEN, FOX CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, she should know better.  He should know better.  But let's look at the ultimate impact on the secretary of state.  We now have lost, as Democrats, any review by a friendly person, to wit the attorney general.  She's made very clear she's stepping away from this investigation.We know with, I think, substantial certainty that the FBI and career prosecutors are much more likely to recommend indictment than would be the political appointees or the attorney general herself.BOLLING:  Jedediah, in 2013, Attorney General Eric Holder recused himself on an investigation that secretly -- about the AP phone records.  In 2008, Michael Mukasey did it.  In 2003, John Ashcroft did it.  In 1999, Janet Reno did it.It's not an unprecedented thing to recuse yourself from a high-profile investigation, is it?JEDEDIAH BILA, FOX CONTRIBUTOR:  It's not.  And she should do that.  And let's be clear about this.  Bill Clinton knows exactly what he's doing.  He knows that he's Bill Clinton.  And this is what he does.  He thinks he's above the law.  The Clintons always think there's a separate set of rules for them.  He's done this repeatedly, this kind of nonsensical behavior, and he gets away with it.So his assumption is, A, that the entire public is dumb and we're going to sit back here and say, Oh, two investigations under way, one into the Clinton Foundation and one into your wife's e-mails, they must have been talking about golf!  I mean they think everybody's a dummy.And then for the people who are smart, they think, Well, they'll just have to sit back and take it because this is what we do and this is how we get ahead, and we do it successfully every time.So it's a bunch of nonsense.  She absolutely should recuse herself.  It looks ridiculous.  The only good that can come of this, I think, is that it exposes the Clintons to people for who they really are, which is people who believe that the rules are one way for everybody else and there's a separate way for them and that they expect to get away from it in spite the truth.Even if you guys know it, you little people out there, you follow the rules.  We, the Clintons, don't have to.  So congratulations, guys. for exposing yourselves for who you are yet again!BOLLING:  Exposing themselves but I think it was that reporter who exposed it, Charles, right?  What about that guy?  Good thing he was paying attention, saw one private jet come in, saw the other waiting and saw the meeting.BILA:  Yes.  (INAUDIBLE)HURT:  Oh, yes.  They -- this is not the story that they wanted out there. There's no doubt.  But Jedediah is exactly right.  You know, this does expose them.  But the problem is, they've been exposing themselves for 25 years on the national public stage.  And so it sort of -- it's kind of like Groundhog Day to have this, you know, going on again.(LAUGHTER)HURT:  But the problem with Bill Clinton -- and I think that he's almost aided by telling a whopper that under any other circumstances, you simply wouldn't believe it.  And the more outlandish the lie is, the better he is at pushing it.And that's what he -- and he's -- and the idea that he would go into a private plane with Loretta Lynch, under -- knowing full well that there was no way something like this could be kept out of the -- eventually out of the public eye, it reveals just how reckless he is, as well as the disregard he has for what anybody thinks.BOLLING:  Doug, do we -- are we expected to believe that Bill Clinton really waited -- just wanted to have a discussion with Loretta Lynch about his brand-new grandchild?SCHOEN:  I don't think, frankly, that, knowing Bill Clinton, having worked with him, that he did anything but.  That being said, it was very bad judgment.  If he wanted to...(CROSSTALK)BOLLING:  Doug, Doug, hold on...HURT:  If he wanted to send messages, he could have.BOLLING:  You're saying that this actually happened the way it's being portrayed...SCHOEN:  Yes.BOLLING:  ... that Bill Clinton waited for Loretta Lynch to talk to her about his grandchild.SCHOEN:  Yes, I think he did.  And I think it was bad judgment.  And I think...(CROSSTALK)BOLLING:  Come on!SCHOEN:  Look, I've worked with him.  None of you have.  I know them.  He operates that way.  It was a big mistake.  It could cost Hillary in the polls and at the courthouse.  And I know that there were other ways he could have operated if he wanted to send a message.  That's what I know. That's what I believe based on 25 years with the Clintons.BOLLING:  Very quickly, Jed, last thought.BILA:  Yes.  Two investigations under way.  I'm going to give Bill Clinton a little bit more credit.  I'm going to say he's very intelligent.  He's politically very savvy, and I think he had a lot more to say to her about some important stuff on the table rather than his grandkids and golf.He probably could have figured out a way to get that message to her some way else.  I think he really wanted to be on that plane for a reason.BOLLING:  I don't know.  I don't have.  Send her an Instagram, maybe...(CROSSTALK)BILA:  Yes, take a photo!(CROSSTALK)BOLLING:  Coming up, it shouldn't be a surprise why most Americans don't trust Hillary Clinton.  According to the latest Fox News poll, only 30 percent think she's honest and trustworthy.  That's next.Plus, sources tell Fox news that FBI agents are furious over Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch's private meeting.  We'll speak with a former FBI agent and the former Secret Service officer who worked in the Clinton White House.That and more as this special edition of ""Hannity"" continues.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PATRICIA STARK, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  This is a Fox News alert.  I'm Patricia Stark.  An update on a hostage situation in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. Right now roughly 100 police commandos are storming a popular restaurant where as many as 35 people are being held hostage.  At least one hostage has escaped.  ISIS is claiming responsibility and they have posted pictures online claiming to show victims of the attack.  Two policemen have been killed.  Two dozen others at the scene were treated for injuries.  Earlier security forces moved in troops and armored vehicles into the area around that restaurant.  The State Department saying all U.S. citizens assigned there are accounted for.  Others were being told to shelter in place.  Again reports from the Bangladesh capital of Dhaka say police are storming a restaurant where as many as 35 people are being held hostage, ISIS taking credit.  I'm Patricia Stark, and now back to ""Hannity.""ERIC BOLLING, FOX NEWS HOST:  Welcome back to this special edition of ""Hannity: Clinton Corruption: The Lynch-Clinton Scandal.""  Brand new Fox polls released this week show how voters really feel about the presumptive Democratic nominee -- 66 percent say they do not think Clinton can be described as honest and trustworthy, and 58 percent of voters think that ""corrupt"" is a word that describes Hillary Clinton.  Here now with reaction are from the polling company, Kellyanne Conway, she also now works for the Trump campaign, and Democratic strategy Jessica Tarlov.  All right, 30 percent, Kellyanne, say that she's honest and trustworthy.  I'm not shocked it's that low.  I'm shocked it's that high.  KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISOR AND POLLSTER:  And she's really got nowhere to go on it.  The numbers have actually gone down since she announced her candidacy a year ago, and then since she became the nominee within this last month.  So this is even somebody who has had an opportunity to reconnect with the American electorate, and I think the more she bashes Donald Trump, the worse she's actually doing.  I would rather be him than her right now because if you look at the attributes testing, he kills it on strong leadership.  And that's what Americans are taking into the polls this time.  They're talking about terrorism, national security, tougher on the economy.  They just want us to be more respected around the world.  The Clinton people are looking at the attributes testing, Eric, and they want this to be about, quote, ""qualifications and experience and temperament.""  But the voters decide what's most important to them, and right now they're truly looking for a strong, tough leader.  BOLLING:  All right, Jess, what about it?  So the knock on Hillary Clinton has been honest and trustworthy for more than a year now, and these things keep happening to her.  At some point where you say there's a ton of smoke, there's fire.  She can't be honest and trustworthy, can she, with all these scandals?  JESSICA TARLOV, DEMOCRATIC POLLSTER AND STRATEGIST:  Well, I think that she can, and Politifact has said as much.  I would like to draw attention to the fact that only 34 percent of Americans say that Donald Trump is honest and trustworthy.  So that's four percent more than Hillary Clinton, but it's still not good.  And while Kellyanne said she's rather be Donald Trump right now, I wouldn't be Donald Trump.  He's lost nine points with men since May.  He's lost 10 points with white Americans without a college degree, eight points for the Republicans.  Right now only 74 percent of Republicans back him, down from 82 percent.  BOLLING:  We're talking about honest and trustworthy.  (CROSSTALK)TARLOV:  I will talk about it.  BOLLING:  Hey, Jess, 34 versus 30.  The old baseball saying, a win is a win.  CONWAY:  This is what Democrats always do, Eric.  You ask them a question about Hillary Clinton, and they try to make the segue about Donald Trump. So let's talk about Donald Trump in the Fox News poll, Jessica.  He is winning by double digits among men.  He is winning by double digits among whites.  He is winning Republicans.  He is winning middle class voters and middle age voters, and he is winning dominantly the people who say national security and terrorism is their number one issue.  Barack Obama is going to go on this, you know, whistle stop tour with Hillary Clinton and try to superglue himself to her, and the majority of Americans according to Fox News polls say they disapprove of his handling of gun control, terrorism, you name it, he's down in those numbers.  TARLOV:  Barack Obama is down in those numbers.  Let's talk about Barack Obama's approval rating.  (CROSSTALK)TARLOV:  I take issue with the fact that you're saying this is just what Democrats do.  I was asked about honesty and trustworthiness and I was directing it to the fact that Donald Trump is not trusted as well.  It is a race to the bottom right now.  You say he's leading in double digits with men.  But he's losing ground.  You're a pollster.  You know the trend line is headed down.  CONWAY:  Then why isn't she at 60 percent?  If all this, as you all keep saying is true, why is this woman not at 60 percent, 70 percent among women?  BOLLING:  Jess, let me -- honest and trustworthy.  Let's stay on this topic.  CONWAY:  And corrupt.  And corrupt.  BOLLING:  She's still under FBI investigation.  TARLOV:  She is.  CONWAY:  And who knows?  On Tuesday, she may be indicted.  We have no idea what's going to go on.  Let me ask you this, Jess.  Would you trust the Clintons to manage your 401(k)?  TARLOV:  Well, I would.  I'm terrible with money, so they must be better than I am, and they have a lot of money.  BOLLING:  So how bad could it be?  CONWAY:  Jessica, you work harder.  BOLLING:  If they only steal 30 or 40 or lose 30, 40 percent, that's better than usual.TARLOV:  No.  Come on.  I know there are honesty problems here.  I know she lied about how the server was handled and she said it was she would be on one device, and we know that that isn't true.  These things are out there and they're there for the public to absorb.  I just take issue with people saying it's only her.  Donald Trump has this problem as well.  That's why I say it's unfortunately a race to the bottom here.  And we will see, as Kellyanne said --BOLLING:  So Kellyanne, Jessica makes a very good point.  Why are Donald Trump's untrustworthies where they all right now also?  She's mired in scandals.  He's not mired in scandals.  Why -- what's with the trustworthy number on the Republican side?  CONWAY:  It's a great question, Eric.  It's for a very different reason. Hers really is embedded in even smart and honest Democrats like Jessica admitting that she lied about the server.  Hers is more of a character question.  Donald Trump's is more about some of the statements he's made. That's why I'd rather be him than her, because you can't overcome --BOLLING:  This is a great point, Jessica.  Donald Trump makes statements and his numbers fall.  Hillary Clinton actually has actions that have consequences to people.  In fact --TARLOV:  Really?  BOLLING:  Benghazi, we can talk about that as well.  But the point is her actions, his commentary, one weighs more than the other, no?  TARLOV:  It's not just his actions.  Part of this is the narrative that she is building about his business practices, for instance, talking about his bankruptcies, and his record not only as a businessman but as a candidate. The man has stood up there on the national stage and said things that are blatantly false.  If you saw an interview last week --BOLLING:  But nothing is illegal.  He hasn't done anything illegal. There's a good indication she very well may have.  I have to leave right there, guys.  CONWAY:  It's because Hillary Clinton is a presidential candidate this time that the FOX News poll actually even ask the word ""corrupt.""  TARLOV:  I don't know about that.BOLLING:  I need to go, guys, I need to go, a hard break coming up.Coming up, sources tell Fox News FBI agents are furious over the private meeting between Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton.  But is this just typical behavior for the Clintons?  Up next, we'll speak with a former FBI agent and the former Secret Service officer who worked in the Clinton White House, that and more as this special edition of 'Hannity' continues.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING:  Welcome back to this special edition of ""Hannity: Clinton Corruption, The Lynch-Clinton Scandal.""  Sources tell Fox News that FBI agents are livid over Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch's private meeting. How much could this meeting compromise their investigation?  Joining us now is someone who saw firsthand how the Clintons operated in the White House.  He's the author of the brand new book ""Crisis of Character, A White House Secret Service Officer Discloses his Firsthand Experience with Hillary, Bill, and How They Operate, former Secret Service officer Gary Byrne.  Also joining us is former assistant director of the FBI in New York Bill Gavin.  Bill, let's start with you.  The FBI, they say they're livid because this investigation may have been corrupted.  What do you hear?  What do you know?  BILL GAVIN, FORMER FBI NEW YORK ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:  They're absolutely livid and well they should be.  You know, when the FBI has responsibility for the protection of the attorney general of the United States, when she's sitting on that plane, those guys didn't just get off that plane to stretch their legs.  They got off the plane because they were asked to leave the plane, knowing full -- when she knew full well that Bill Clinton was coming.  That wasn't a casual meeting in an airport.  It was a scheduled meeting. And as I understand it occurred on board the plane.  They ought to be livid over something like that.  Everybody says it got a bad optic.  It's not just a bad optic.  It's horrid judgment on her part, and either conniving or horrid judgment on Bill Clinton's part as well.  BOLLING:  All right, Gary, the last part of the title of your book says, ""and how they operate.""  How does Bill Clinton operate?  GARY BYRNE, ""CRISIS OF CHARACTER"" AUTHOR:  So what I saw of that meeting reminded me of an incident when I worked at the White House.  It's basically what I refer to, Eric, as soft intimidation.  My experience is that President Clinton planned that meeting, and just, you know, to let her know that he's there.  And, you know, in some cases I would say President Clinton may be more powerful now than he was he was president.  He doesn't have to answer to anybody.  He sits on a pile of cash and it's very familiar circumstances that, like I said, I saw when I worked in the West Wing where he one time softly intimidated an officer who was testifying against him in the Monica Lewinsky trial.  BOLLING:  Bill, what should Loretta Lynch have done?  Should she have told the former president ""Don't board my plane""?  GAVIN:  Absolutely.  To board that plane, for him to be on there, not just talking about -- you can't tell me they're just talking about grandchildren and golf games.  That is a half an hour meeting.  More gets discussed than that, whether it's nonverbal or it's verbal.  It's the wrong thing to do. And she's a smart woman.  I take my hat off to her for stepping back at this point, but I'm not sure why that was done or whether she was directed to do it.  BOLLING:  Let me say with you there, Bill.  How does she undermine their investigation?  GAVIN:  Well, basically, well, the Bureau, the FBI has all of the facts that they're gathering together.  The director, Jim Comey, has put together a wonderful team of people who bring this whole thing together.  I think the problem is that everybody believes now the FBI is going to be in charge and do an indictment.  FBI still does an investigation.  The indictment process has to take place through the Department of Justice, and the deputy attorney general of the United States is probably one that will handle it.  And so it's still in a political arena.  It's a very difficult task for the deputy attorney general.  But I can assure you, the director of the FBI will not bring those facts across Pennsylvania Avenue to determine whether or not they're going to have a grand jury unless he believes fully it would be a grand jury that may affect not only the server but it may also affect the Clinton Foundation.  BOLLING:  This just muddies the whole water the way the process works, is, as you point out, the FBI director Comey goes over there and says, here is the information, Loretta Lynch has to make the decision to convene the grand jury.  Now with all this, people will be questioning what did Bill Clinton say to under the influence that decision?  Gary, you tell Bill Clinton ""You can't board my plane,"" what is his reaction?  BYRNE:  I don't even think he would acknowledge.  He would just keep coming on.  I think he would just walk across the tarmac regardless of what he was told and walk on.  He's Bill Clinton.  BOLLING:  Expand on that a little.  Let me ask you this.   BYRNE:  Sure.  BOLLING:  Bill Clinton does this, has this meeting.  It blows wide open and we're talking about it.  He goes back to Hillary Clinton.  What does she say to him?  BYRNE:  She probably says, how did the meeting go?  And he probably said, well, I made my presence there and I think he gets the message.  I don't know what was actually said, but I've seen this many years, for 25 years we've heard about this soft intimidation, and this is just another example.  BOLLING:  I'm sorry, Bill, you know, am wondering if she did, as Gary points out, that she knew about it.  I wonder if she did.  If she knew about it, wouldn't she be smart as a presidential candidate nominee, Democratic nominee to say hey, husband, Bill, don't go there?  GAVIN:  I kind of suspect that maybe he did a little bit of this on his own as he always does.  But I would imagine that she didn't ask how that meeting went.  When she found out what Loretta Lynch did today, somebody is going to be sleeping on the couch tonight, and I don't think it's going to be her.  BOLLING:  I have to tell you, if I were here and she didn't know about that meeting, I would be out, front and center.  With all these transparency issues she has, I'd be out front saying this happened, and I had nothing to do with it.  But that is a tough call on her part.  We're going to have to leave it right there, guys.  Thank you so much. We'll have more on this special edition of ""Hannity: Clinton Corruption: The Lynch-Clinton Scandal,"" right back after the break.
