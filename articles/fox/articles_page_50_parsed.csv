 Press Politics 
"	"And now the most scintillating two minutes in television, the latest from the political grapevine:Press PoliticsA new poll indicates that while more than half of national journalists claim to be moderate, nearly five times more say they're liberal than say they're conservative. The Pew Poll shows 54 percent describe themselves as moderate, 34 percent say they're liberal, and only 7 percent say they're conservative.This is in striking contrast to the general public, where more than four times as many say they're conservative, and significantly fewer say they're moderate or liberal. In addition, an earlier pew poll found that 58 percent of the general public say believing in God is necessary to be moral, but this new survey shows that only 6 percent of national journalists say that.Similarly, more than 40 percent of the general public feel that homosexuality should be discouraged by society, but only 5 percent of national journalists say that.Time to Graduate... Or Debate?Noted American novelist E.L. Doctorow used a commencement speech at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, yesterday to launch an attack on President Bush, insisting the president is -- ""[doing a] very poor job of combating terrorism."" Doctorow specifically condemned President Bush for -- ""going off to war ... [based on] an exciting story... designed to send shivers up our spines. But it was not true.""At that, many in the crowd burst into boos so loud that Doctorow had to stop his speech. When the school president intervened and pleaded with them to -- ""let him finish,"" some students and most of the faculty responded with a standing ovation. Parents and many students, however, were described by Newsday as livid, saying a college graduation is no place for a political speech.Denounced by Dems and RepublicansSouth Carolina Democratic Sen. Ernest Hollings is now catching it from all sides for saying that President Bush went to war in Iraq to please Jews in the U.S. John Kerry calls the comments -- ""absurd,"" saying they -- ""lend credence to unacceptable and baseless anti-Semitic stereotypes that have no place ... anywhere."" And Virginia Republican Senator George Allen says he -- ""deplores ... the anti-Semitic, political conspiracy statements.""Virginia Republican Congressman Eric Cantor, meanwhile, has sent a letter to Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle, urging him to -- ""end your silence by loudly and clearly rejecting these bigoted remarks.""New Way To Increase Ticket Revenues?The District of Columbia -- a city famous for its hard-ball policing of parking violations -- has apparently come across a new way to increase its ticket revenues: aggressive enforcement of pocket trash.After 28-year-old Andy Chasin found a used FedEx address label in his pocket, he threw it into a corner trash can. But that was too much for the city waste inspector, who has fined Chasin $35 for -- ""Improper Use of Public Litter Receptacles,"" insisting Chasin violated statute 24 DCMR, 1009.1, which states -- ""Public wastepaper boxes shall not be used for the disposal of refuse incidental to the conduct of a household.""-- FOX News' Michael Levine contributed to this report"	['Allen']	['god']
1	1	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2012/04/19/position-politics/	 Position Politics 	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" December , 2010. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY.: This is eerily reminiscent of the experience last December , and I predict the American people will have the same reaction to this bill they had to the healthcare bill a year ago. SEN. HARRY REID, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER, D-NEV.: Christmas is a week from Saturday. I understand that. But I hope the Republicans understand it also, because we are going t o complete our work no matter how long it takes in this congress. We have to do the work of the American people. We've been stalled and stalled and stalled this whole Congress. (END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, HOST OF ""SPECIAL REPORT"": We are just getting word from Democratic aide on the Senate said that the U.S. government runs out of money midnight on Saturday could be shut down for a day or two according to aides because of the clock that's running in the Senate and schedule of things. Senator Reid is supposed to bring up this omnibus spending bill, $1.1 trillion, and many Republicans have a lot of problems with it. Senator John McCain from Arizona went to the floor saying there are 6,400 earmarks at $8.3 billion. His favorite is $300,000 for the Polynesian Voyaging Society and $165,000 for maple syrup research in Vermont. What about all of this? Let's bring in our panel, Steve Hayes, senior writer for the Weekly Standard, A.B. Stoddard, associate editor of The Hill, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Steve, this looks likes a collision course. STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: I say fine, shut it down. You have a Congress that's more unpopular now than in history of the country. BAIER: It's 13 percent by Gallup. HAYES: We have had in the United States in the past two years, closest thing to European style one party government than we've ever had.  The reason that we're in the fix is because Democrats chose to put us in the fix. They chose not to do the things that they needed to do to ensure it didn't happen.  They created the problem so they had to create an emergency solution.  That's why we are seeing what we're seeing today. The problem they never did a budget. The earmarks are problem. We should eliminate them if we can. But by not doing budget and cramming it through an omnibus, it gives the committee chairman tremendous discretion to raise level of discretionary funding on year-by-year basis. What it does, talk about the spending levels going forward, it sets a new and much higher potential baseline.  So you're talking about $15 billion or $20 billion higher next year than this year, which is double what we're talking about in earmarks. BAIER: We do talk about earmarks a lot because these the crazy projects, A.B., but there's $1 billion in here for healthcare law implementation which would make it tougher for Republicans in Congress to try to unravel the funding for next year if it's funded through the year. A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, THE HILL: I'm not a shutdown proponent as Steve is, but I would also agree for the Democrats at this point to try to pass omnibus bill, even if it has to further their goals like funding healthcare is a stretch. The House passed a continuing resolution. We have run out of time. I know appropriators like to appropriate, and that is their responsibility. They should have gotten them done by September, which is what their job really is to do.  The Senate has been in a lockdown filibuster now for ten days. I think the Democrats are frustrated and trying to call the Republicans' bluff. It is their fault they're in this position. I don't know how they actually get the votes for the bill. I really don't. We saw Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri and other Democrats joining her against it.  In the end they will have to pass continuing resolution. I'm not a shutdown proponent. BAIER: Despite the fact there are Republicans in here, many of them who have earmarks, the pet projects in this omnibus, many of those are now saying they are still going to vote against it now. STODDARD: Right. That is the interesting thing. The Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, Senator Thune, Senator Cornyn all of the leadership have earmarks in there. But they say they found religion and ready to oppose it. I can't imagine the bill can pass 60-vote hurdle. BAIER: Charles? CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I think the poison in here for Republicans is the billion dollars, relatively small amount, that would be used to implement Obamacare. The reason it's so destructive is it takes out of the hands of the new incoming the legitimate Congress issue of how to deal with Obamacare and illegitimate voted out Congress who would oppose $1 billion, and that means that the Republicans would no longer have the way of stopping Obamacare by removing the funding because if it passes now, then next year the Republicans will be required to take it out, have the House support that and override a veto. So that's why there is strong opposition apart from earmarks. But on issue of the shutdown, I'm not quite as blithe as Steve is on this. Of course, I wouldn't mind if it shut down for a week or two or three, save the money. The problem it's revisiting of what happened with Gingrich and Clinton. Clinton was way down and a lost mid-term election and it revived him.         People are not going to go through the reasoning of the difference between omnibus and continuing resolution in explaining what happened. The blame will fall on Republicans. They'll look at the television and see the bill read over 50 hours over Republican request. They will see the government shutdown, and they will say its Republicans. Why would you want to invite that and give yourself losing happened? BAIER: Steve, some Republicans would say this is what the election was about. They feel the wind is at their back. They could push hard for resolution to put it in their hands in the new Congress. HAYES: Absolutely. You can argue the public will blame Republicans.  I say there is equal evidence to suggest that the public would credit Republicans at this point given the levels of dissatisfaction with the congress given levels of concern about the deficit spending given the animosity toward Washington in general. That is a big question. But there's another advantage to doing it this way and it's to put President Obama in a box. He didn't like signing the omnibus in 2009 shortly after being sworn in. He talked about cutting back on earmarks and talked about not wanting to sign it. He was advised you can't do this.  You're the new president and it would be the worst way to start off relations with congress. KRAUTHAMMER: A family that arrives at Yellowstone on Christmas and finds it shut is not going through the reasoning of the omnibus. It will be recapitulation of what happened in the early '90s and Republicans will take the hit for it. BAIER: Last word, A.B.? STODDARD: The administration is opposed to the omnibus spending bill.  They haven't come out and said so publicly. BAIER: But why not? STODDARD: They're purposely not making suspect portative statements and they encourage for stop gap continuing resolution. BAIER: Why not come out and say, OK, this is not going to work. I voted for the last one and I regretted it. I'm not going to let it pass. STODDARD: I think they ruffled enough liberal feathers for a ten-day period perhaps. BAIER: Our online poll question, do you think Senate will ratify the start agreement with Russia in the lame duck session of congress? Go to FOXnews.com/specialreport and you can vote there. Next up, the future of the tax rate compromise.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REID: Whether you agree with all the contents of the bill or not, everyone should understand this is one of the major accomplishments of any congress where two parties ideologically divided have agreed on a major issue for the American people. (END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Well the tax rate compromise bill with the extension on unemployment benefits as well passed the Senate today overwhelmingly. It heads to the House tomorrow. There is some opposition but most believe it will pass there as well.  It's interesting to see the Republicans and the split between potential 2012 candidates. Here's Mitt Romney in the USA Today saying he's against this, ""Because the extension is temporary, a large portion of the investment and job growth that characteristically accompanies low taxes will be lost.""  To answer that, Senator John Thune took to the Senate floor yesterday saying it may be politically expedient to stand on the sideline and criticize the proposal, but if you are against it, he said, you are for tax increase January 1.  We're back with the panel. What about the split, Charles? KRAUTHAMMER: I wouldn't say politically expedient. It's politically smart. Romney is reflecting the spirit of November by opposing this, where the message was deep opposition to bloated government and huge deficit. To give you an example how bloated this is, Paul Ryan who supports it, admitted on ""Fox News Sunday"" there is $313 billion of excess spending in this.  You heard squawking on the omnibus bill and $8 billion in earmarks. That is 39 times blown away in one-week deal. BAIER: Blow it up and let the tax increase happen January 1st. KRAUTHAMMER: Those who support the bill, like Newt Gingrich, Huckabee, Thune, are the ones saying we would have ordinarily; otherwise we would not have had the continuation of rates. That's not so. In January, the Republicans would have been in the House and retroactively passed clean tax cut extension and the Senate would have supported it. There's no way Obama would have vetoed it. BAIER: You don't buy the deal businesses having to plan for the taxes to redo them twice, the whole thing. KRAUTHAMMER: It would have been a hiccup. The Democrats and the president would have gotten the blame and Republicans would have cleaned it up in January. This is completely unnecessary. BAIER: A.B.? STODDARD: There's real evidence now that the outside pressure the conservative groups and pressure from the 2012  Republican nominating process is going to weigh on shoulders of congressional Republicans trying to govern over the next two years entirely, not just on this issue. I'm fascinated that when you have Congressman Ron Paul, a grandfather, founding member of the Tea Party movement, Congressman Paul Ryan and Newt Gingrich, the entire Republican leadership up against Rush Limbaugh, Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney, the question who is more conservative is making the leaders nervous. The soon to be majority leader Eric Cantor released something to press telling what a yes vote would mean, what a no vote would mean.  And there's actually something here that says why not wait until January 11 when the Republicans control the house. They said this is no time to play game with the economy. For member elected and have to cast a vote that could shock a stock market, that's different story for someone on the outside planning to run for president. HAYES: I don't think you can say with certainty that Charles does that President Obama would not support this kind of a tax hike if it came to that. So in Mitt Romney's editorial, I found it utterly incoherent. On the one hand he's saying a two year extension of rates leads to this tremendous amount of uncertainty, and what does he propose instead?  Instead He says either we'll have the higher taxes or the uncertainty of not having any bill. So we don't know what president Obama would do. It's not clear he'd say I've got to be against this. It doesn't make sense. KRAUTHAMMER: I think what you are seeing here is the tax cut religionists, those who believe that any tax cut is good no matter what it costs, and those who have the larger vision, which is that deficit and increase government especially when the price you pay for tax cut is a huge amount of wasteful spending, that I think is the prevailing sentiment of the electorate but the establishment still has tax cut religion. BAIER: You don't buy the economy would crater if taxes go up? KRAUTHAMMER: No. You would have had a hiccup and understanding a change in January. It would be a two week delay.

2	2	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/07/16/glenn-beck-discusses-holders-pure-partisan-politics	Glenn Beck discusses Holder's 'pure partisan politics'	"This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" July 16, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, ""THIS WEEK""/ABC NEWS)ERIC HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL: There's a certain level of vehemence it seems to me that's directed at me, directed at the president. You know, people talk about taking their country back.There's a certain racial component to this for some people. I don't think that's the main driver, but for some there's a racial animus.(END VIDEO CLIP)MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Well, that was Attorney General Eric Holder speaking to ABC News over the weekend, suggesting some of the president's critics are just motivated by race. Earlier I asked Glenn Beck for his take on that.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)GLENN BECK, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: I am so deeply saddened by Eric Holder in the way he views his own office. He hasn't investigated the things that should be investigated. He's playing pure partisan politics here. This is the kind of thing that I'm talking about where, let's not be divisive any more. Let's not be divisive any more. For people to say that it's racist because we disagree with somebody's policies is nonsense. If you are judging a man by the content of his character, it's not racism and by looking at the pattern of Eric Holder's character, I can tell you that he's not a guy that views his office with a high regard to justice.KELLY: To what extent do you think -- because I know you studied the administration and American politics in general -- to what extent do you think Eric Holder speaks for President Obama?BECK: They're very close.KELLY: Do you think he's the hand of the king?BECK: Yes, I do. I think he is some -- there's -- have you ever seen anybody get away with as much stuff or let the other side get away with as much stuff? I've never seen that in American politics. I've never seen investigation after investigation after investigation. They're still not looking into the FBI. Nobody has talked to the Tea Party group in Houston, True the Vote, nobody has talked to them in 15 months from the Justice Department. Now how does that happen?KELLY: And, you know, with all due respect to my colleague at ABC News who interviewed Mr. Holder, they didn't even touch on the IRS, Glenn. It's so rare to get the attorney general in an interview, and I said many times that that would be my number one, my number one person in the world I would like to interview, is Eric Holder.BECK: I would cuddle up with a gallon of Ben and Jerry's to watch that. I would love that.KELLY: Save me some Cherry Garcia.BECK: Yes.KELLY: But he's got him there and he didn't ask him about the IRS controversy plan. I mean, it's a dereliction once the President declare not a smidgen. The people who believe in him took that and moved on.Let me circle back to the race remark though, because something else Eric Holder said was, you know, we need to sort of be able to have this adult conversation about race in this country, he was defending his remarks from a couple of years ago when he said we're a nation of cowards when it comes to race.And of course, many of his critics said, oh, there he goes again, but what do you think about it? I mean, obviously, you had suggested that President Obama didn't like white people, I mean, you apologized for that, you took it back and you give a full-throated apology for that remark. But do you think he had a point that we as a society are not capable of having an adult conversation about race rules and the truth?BECK: Megyn, I don't want to -- I don't know Eric Holder at all. And quite honestly, I haven't paid attention to Eric Holder for quite some time, because he doesn't have anything of value for me to hear. I know what he's going to say. So, it doesn't have anything to value for me to hear. He's not saying anything new.With that being said, I think the American people are incredibly courageous. I think the only ones that I have seen, the ones who keep bringing race into it, are the ones who fought in the 1960s, one side or another, who lived through all of that. I'm 50, I didn't live through that. It was over by the time I became aware. We've never -- my children don't look at race as an issue. We believe in Martin Luther King's statement, judge a man by the content of his character.It seems to me that there is a generation of people who lived through that period that just cannot let go of it. Either that or their people -- I mean, Eric Holder is probably about my age -- either that or they have been raised to feel this way. I don't know, but I don't want to live in Eric Holder's world that -- where you believe that Americans are cowards, that they do hate each other for race reasons. I don't know those people, I know they exist.KELLY: Of course they exist.BECK: But I don't know those people.KELLY: Of course they exist.BECK: That's not what America is.KELLY: Well, that's the thing, he must be referring to some significant contingent in his mind otherwise it wouldn't there mentioning, and so that's why people play a lot of attention. I got to stand you by because we have to move on.(END VIDEOTAPE)KELLY: We're going to have much more with Glenn tomorrow. But Glenn has a special movie theater event coming up on July 22nd, ""We Will Not Conform."" A special presentation about Common Core. It will be interesting. Michelle Malkin's in it.Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2014 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
