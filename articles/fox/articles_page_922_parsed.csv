This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to ""Hannity."" And tonight, the 2016 Republican presidential candidates are out in full force. Now, this weekend, Donald Trump won the primaries in Louisiana and Kentucky, and tomorrow four more states will hold Republican contests, one of those being the all-important state of Michigan.An NBC News/Wall Street Journal Marist poll is now out that shows that important state has Donald Trump ahead with 41 percent of the vote, Senator Ted Cruz in second with 22 percent, followed by Senator Marco Rubio, who had 17 percent, John Kasich in fourth with 13 percent. A brand-new Monmouth University Michigan poll shows Trump on top with 36 percent, then it's Senator Ted Cruz with 23 and John Kasich is in third with 21 percent, Senator Rubio has 13 percent.Here now with reaction, 2016 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, good to see you. There's also a FOX 2 poll that you up by 18, so it's 13, 28 and 22 in the biggest state in tomorrow's contests.How do you feel about where you are in Michigan?DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, you just made me feel very good. I hadn't heard these numbers. Those numbers are really terrific.Well, I love the people of Michigan. I'm fighting hard for them with the car industry. I'm constantly talking about the car companies moving out and going out Mexico and other places, Sean, and they know I will protect them. I will not let it happen. We're not going to lose our industries anymore.We've been the foolish country for so long with this free trade, but it's not free trade because it's -- you know, just doesn't work. I mean, it's not working. You look at the deficits we have.So I think Michigan and the people of Michigan know -- really, they know that I'm going to protect them. They're great people.HANNITY: You know, everyone says, when you talk about this, that you're going to fight for tougher trade deals, they say, Oh, that's protectionist.  I don't hear that from you. I hear you're going to go in there, bang on the table and get better trade deals that will fix this imbalance, especially with countries like China and Mexico.I don't hear -- I've never heard you say the word protectionist, not one time. But some of your opponents say that.TRUMP: Not at all.HANNITY: What is your answer?TRUMP: Not at all. Well, they say it for their own reasons. Look. I love free trade. I love the concept of free trade. Everything about it is good. I went to the Wharton School of Finance. They say, Let's go free trade.But you know, it has to be smart trade. It has to be trade that's good for the United States, not just for the other countries. And if you look at China -- and frankly, Vietnam now is doing a big number, and you look at Japan and India and Mexico -- Mexico's killing us at the border and they're killing us with trade. You look at Ford. Ford is building a $2.5 billion plant in Mexico to make cars, trucks and parts.So it has nothing to do with anything. I love free trade, but we need great leadership to have real free trade. And we don't have good leadership. We have leadership that doesn't know what it's doing.The people of Michigan and the people of our country -- we have lost our industries, such a big chunk of our industries and our jobs, and I'm not going to let that happen. It won't happen anymore, believe me.HANNITY: All right, Mr. Trump, I would argue that this is a two-man race, and unless Senator Rubio and John -- Governor Kasich start showing some wins and putting them on the board, to me, it's a two-man race. I think you agree with that. You said you want to go mano-a-mano with Ted Cruz.  He says he wants the same with you.Here's -- I want to ask you this question because it's the question I'm most frequently asked about you. And as I go on social media, it seems to be a very strong Trump contingent and people aren't budging. You have strong supporters and Ted Cruz supporters. And there's a battle now going on between you two.And the single most named criticism or question I get, Tell me where Donald Trump is conservative? Explain how he'll be conservative. And I want to give you that opportunity to explain to people because no one ever asks you that.TRUMP: Sure. I mean, I'd like to do that, and in so many ways. But at the same time, I don't like labels necessarily because a label doesn't mean very much. But when it comes to being conservative, I happen to be conservative. I'm very, very strong on energy independence, as you know, and I think that's the most conservative position. And I have the most conservative position on that.I'm very, very so-called conservative on the military. I want a very, very strong military. I want to build up -- you know, our military is totally depleted. We're going to care of our vets as part of that whole situation because our vets are not taken care of properly.Nobody is more conservative when it comes to trade than I am. Now, you can go and you can say, well, gee I'm not a free trader, but I am a free trader, but I'm also a fare trader and a smart trader. I want to make sure that the United States gains something. So I think you would probably agree. You've been dealing with me for a long time, so...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: I want better trade deals. I agree with you.TRUMP: So we want smart trade. We want trade that's going to be beneficial for us, not just suck all our jobs and our money out of our system. If you look at what China done to us over the last 15 years, it's just horrible. It's outrageous that they get away with it.I'm certainly when it comes to health care -- I mean, we want to repeal and replace ""Obama care."" We're going to repeal -- ""Obama care"" is a total disaster for this country, a total and complete disaster. We're going to come up with plans, and there are lots of alternatives. We're going to come up with plans that are far less expensive, better for the people and better for the country.I'm certainly very conservative when it comes to education. We're getting rid of Common Core. We're going to have education at a local level. I mean, there's so many different things. I'm really very conservative when you get right down to it. But I don't like even...HANNITY: Taxes.TRUMP: ... necessarily...HANNITY: Yes.TRUMP: Oh, cut taxes. Well, my plan, actually Larry Kudlow, who's a fantastic guy, I think likes my plan the most. I'm cutting taxes by about the most.And you know, we're the highest taxed nation in the world. Our middle class is just reeling from the taxes. And you know, if you think about it, the middle class and the workers of this country, who really built the country, they haven't had a raise in 12 years. They're making less now actually -- to be even worse about it, they're making less now than they did 12 years ago.I'm in Mississippi right now. I have a group of 8,000 people I'm going to speak to, and the people came up to me just a little while ago and they said, You know, Mr. Trump, we're making less money now than we made 8 and 10 and 12 years ago. That shouldn't be. That's not true with a lot of other countries. It just shouldn't be.HANNITY: Yes, I mean, median income is down thousands of dollars, millions more in poverty, on food stamps and out of the labor force.TRUMP: Right.HANNITY: So you -- you -- because I've interviewed you so often, it's kind of amazing to me that people don't hear it, and I'm trying to explain to people because I think there's some people that are saying they're going to pick up the toys and go home if their guy doesn't win, but you're -- you want American energy-independent. Hillary doesn't want that. You're going to be strong on the military. Well, that's straight out of Reagan's playbook. Trade, which you just mentioned, ObamaCare.You also said when you gave your specifics that you support health care savings accounts. That's on your Web site right now.TRUMP: 100 percent.HANNITY: Yes.TRUMP: 100 percent. It's so simple, so good. It's so much less expensive. It's much better. You can have your plan. You really have an asset. You can go anywhere with it, you know, beyond state lines. You can do whatever you want with it.You know, it's just so much better. And you know what? It gives people the incentive to negotiate because it's theirs. It's not -- you're not dealing with government bureaucrats. It's theirs. It's their money. They want to spend as little as possible.Right now, they walk in and they say, Give me everything under the kitchen sink. I mean, the people have an incentive to spend wisely. So the health care savings accounts are such a good thing. It's such a good idea. And it's time for it. I know you've liked it for years.HANNITY: I have.TRUMP: I've been hearing you long before I really knew too much about it.  And then, you know, a few years ago, I started really looking. And it was always amazing to me that the politicians didn't -- they hardly even considered it when they were talking about ObamaCare. And...HANNITY: Between energy...TRUMP: ... ""Obama care"" is just a disaster.HANNITY: Between energy independence, the repatriated money at a low tax rate to incentive companies to bring back money they had parked overseas that would be highly taxed if they bring it back -- those two things I think would go a long way to growing the economy, creating millions of jobs, and on top of that, spending less.And I think I'm pulling you in on the penny plan at least in areas outside the military.TRUMP: Yes. Well, I like the concept of the penny plan -- not for the military because the military we have to build up. But we can save probably in many case more than a penny if you look at it. I mean, the penny plan is a pretty good plan, and it's a pretty simple plan.And you know, it's something -- I think in some cases, a penny is nothing compared to the kind of numbers. Then you get to fraud, waste and abuse, Sean. I mean, the fraud and the waste and the abuse, which everybody agrees if you can solve that problem, but it's, you know, mind-boggling the kind of numbers.So we can get our budgets in place. The one thing we really have to take care of -- you know, the health care is going to be less money, and we're going to have much better health care.HANNITY: So let me ask this...TRUMP: Just so you understand...HANNITY: Yes. I don't want to interrupt you, but you know, because you can also add to your list, I guess, you're conservative on immigration.  You're conservative on the issue of people, refugees coming into the country, enhanced interrogation.TRUMP: Well, I'm the most conservative. Yes. Sure.HANNITY: So my question is, when your opponents...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: When your opponents say you're not conservative, why don't you say all that to them? Because I've watched you in debates, and I'm just curious why you haven't just said, I'm conservative here, here, here, and here.TRUMP: I don't know. I think -- you know, you're given 30 seconds.  You're given an answer of 30 seconds at these crazy debates, and you know, according to Drudge...HANNITY: They are crazy.TRUMP: ... and all the people that do the polls -- no, it's ridiculous. I mean, they have, you know, Mr. Trump, explain why you're conservative. You have 19 seconds left, OK?(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: And again, I like...HANNITY: I don't mean to laugh...TRUMP: ... the conservative label...HANNITY: ... but it's true.TRUMP: I know, but it's true. It's, like, you know, you have 19 seconds to speak.HANNITY: Yes.TRUMP: I'll tell you what. I'll tell you that -- like ""Obama care"" is an example. It's going to die of its own weight, but we have to kill it sooner. It's going to die of its own weight. You know, in '17, it's so astronomical and so expensive.And if you look at what that's doing to the labor force, Sean, where people are -- have part-time jobs -- people that never had a part-time job in their lives, people that have worked for a company 20 and 30 years are now working for the same company as a part-timer because of ""Obama care,"" because of the basic advantages to doing that in terms of ""Obama care"" for an employer.So there are so many problems that we have that we can straighten out so simply. But no, I'm a conservative. I would say that you just said it best right now because who is better than me on the border and with immigration? Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a great guy, but you -- we say he's a tough cookie, OK? He endorsed me last week because I'm the best in immigration. And I think by his definition of the best, it's the best and the toughest. And I got Sheriff Joe to...HANNITY: Yes.TRUMP: ... endorse me last week. And he called up. He said, You're the right guy. You're the toughest guy for it. And you know, that's a pretty good thing.HANNITY: We got to take a break. I want to ask you about what Mitt Romney said and this brokered convention idea, which John Kasich said is exciting.  I think it's a bad idea.We'll have more with 2016 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump right after this break.Quick programming note. This Wednesday, we'll be interviewing Mr. Trump for the hour in Fayetteville, North Carolina, at the Crown Center Arena in front of a crowd. If you want to be there and if you live in and around the area, just go over to Hannity.com right now, find out all the details.  Sign up for the event. And we hope to see you in Fayetteville two days from now.More ""Hannity"" right after this break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)HANNITY:  And welcome back to ""Hannity."" We continue now with 2016 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.All right, before I get to the brokered convention, your campaign came out with a brand-new ad today against Marco Rubio. Florida is a very big state. You're leading there. To me, it's a must-win for Marco. Let's roll this ad.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Corrupt Marco Rubio has spent years defrauding the people of Florida. As a legislator, he flipped on a key vote after making a quick $200,000 from selling his house to the mother of the bill's lobbyist.He used the Republican Party's credit card to pave his driveway and to live it up to Las Vegas. When he got caught, he said he had used the wrong credit card, but he had used the same Republican Party card for six flights between Miami and Tallahassee, then billed the state for the same airline tickets and pocketed the cash until once again, he got caught.On top of it all, Rubio's been a total no-show in the U.S. Senate with the worst voting record of all. Marco Rubio, another corrupt, all-talk, no- action politician.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, Mr. Trump, respond to that ad. Why is that important?  I read that they're going to put $25 million or more in ads against you, so it's going to be pretty brutal in Florida.TRUMP: Well, I think it's important because I've been hearing about it for years. Actually, Jeb Bush brought it up at the debate and he was doing it very well, and all of a sudden, I don't know what happened, but he got shut down. And Jeb, in all fairness -- she should have kept going with that. I think he would have made a big point that night.But he brought up the credit card situation. He brought up some other things about Marco. Look, Marco's had this hanging over his head for a long time. I live in Florida, practically. You know, it's my second home.  I have a lot of businesses there. I employ thousands and thousands of people. I own Trump National Doral, which just had the big golf tournament that was won by Adam Scott (ph) yesterday. And you know, it's -- I know so much about Florida.I've been hearing about his credit card problems for so long, what he did with the Republican Party. You had people that doing the checking, accounting people and other people -- I mean, they were devastated that nothing was done with Rubio because of what he did. And you know, it says it in the ad. Now, maybe he can prove otherwise, but it says it very well in the ad.In addition to that, a total non-show senator. I mean, he was elected -- he defrauded the people of Florida. He was elected to be a senator. He was elected to go and vote on important matters, and he's all over the country. He's not voting. I mean, he's not voting.And this is beyond just the electoral -- you know, the election stuff. He doesn't go to the United States Senate. I must say, if I were a United States senator, I would be so honored to be in that magnificent chamber voting for the people of Florida.And I think the people of Florida are fed up. I don't think he can -- I mean, I may be wrong, but I don't think he can be elected dogcatcher in Florida.I was -- I have so many -- you know, you know, I'm in Florida all the time.  I just left Florida to come to Mississippi. I'm going back to Florida.  And I'll tell you what. The people in Florida think that he's literally defrauded them because you look at what he does. He never goes and votes.  He's never over there.HANNITY: Well, let me ask this...TRUMP: He's got one of the worst records of voting in history.HANNITY: Eighteen of the twenty contests now have been won by outsiders, insurgents, and you have won the overwhelming majority of them. Ted Cruz is in second place. And you know, Marco won Minnesota and he won Puerto Rico yesterday. OK, fair enough.But the establishment has thrown all this money, and I assume they'll throw tens of millions more against you. And then we have this -- this an equation that is now emerging, and that is, OK, let's prevent -- let's keep all these guys in. Let's push Rubio in Florida. Let's push Kasich in Ohio. John Kasich says, Oh, that's exciting to have a brokered convention.That seems to me to be designed purposely to stop either you or Ted Cruz, whoever has more delegates at the end of this, if you don't make 1,237.  Why do I believe that that is purposely being done to stop you? Do you not see it that way?TRUMP: Well, I think you're right. It's designed to stop somebody. Maybe it's me because I've won a lot more than Ted has won. But Ted is certainly in second place, and Marco is doing very, very poorly. And I will tell you it's done for some reason.you know, one of the biggest stories in all of politics worldwide, in all of politics in this country, for decades is what's happened with the Republican Party. Do you know that people coming out to vote are up 50, 60, 70 percent?HANNITY: It's amazing.TRUMP: And in a couple of states...HANNITY: It's massive!TRUMP: ... it was over 100 percent?HANNITY: Yes.TRUMP: I will take full credit for that, by the way.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: I'm going to tell you right now I'm taking 100 percent credit.HANNITY: OK.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: No, I don't doubt that that's a big part of it, but any...TRUMP: But you know that this is -- this is the biggest story in all of politics worldwide! And people talk about it. But they don't talk about - - this is such a great thing for the Republican Party, and instead of dividing and fighting, we should take advantage of it.And you know who the people are that are coming out to vote? Democrats and independents. They're coming out by the millions! We have millions, 5 million people coming out to vote out of nowhere. It's never happened before.I've been on the cover of ""Time"" magazine just about -- I think it was four times now. I'm on this week also. Four times now in the last few months, and a lot of it is because of this. They've never seen this happen before.HANNITY: Listen...TRUMP: And instead of the Republicans fighting, Sean, they should say, This is a blessing.HANNITY: Yes. I agree. All right, Mr. Trump, we're going to see you Wednesday, by the way, in North Carolina.TRUMP: Good.HANNITY: We're doing an hour show in front of a crowd, and we appreciate you being with us. It's all part of the best coverage. And if you want to be there, by the way, go over to Hannity.com right now to find out the details. Sign up and you can be in the audience, Fayetteville, two days from now.Now, also coming up tonight -- Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders took part in a FOX News Democratic town hall earlier tonight. We'll check in with Monica Crowley and Dr. Gina Loudon. That's next.And much, much more as we continue.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Tomorrow's election day.  Mississippi is a battleground. Let me tell you, the men and women here...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're with you, Ted!CRUZ: The men and women here and across this state are in the position to decide this outcome. I'm going to ask each of you not just to come out tomorrow, but to pick up the phone and call five people, call ten people, call your friends, call your family, call your neighbors and say this election matters. It matters to me. It matters to my kids and my grandkids.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Texas senator Ted Cruz had two big wins this past Saturday. He won the Republican contests in Kansas and Maine. And joining us now, the man himself, 2016 Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz.Senator, you know, we spent all this time on Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada, and then, boom, it's like you're not even aware that -- three days of contests, then more contests. Very difficult. It speeds up exponentially.How do you feel where you are right now in terms of the delegate count and the path to the nomination?CRUZ: Well, Sean, it's great to be with you. And thank you. You know, we've had an incredible week, and the momentum behind our campaign -- it keeps growing and growing.You know, it started a week ago on super-Tuesday. Super-Tuesday was simply a tidal wave of support for our campaign as we locked down wins across the country, and then this Saturday that momentum only increased. This Saturday, we won two states outright. We won Kansas with a landslide, nearly 50 percent of the vote. We also won Maine with a terrific win there.And then in Louisiana and Kentucky -- in Louisiana, we tied Donald Trump for the delegate outcome, so we ended up coming out with a dead heat. He narrowly edged us out in Kentucky.But I think what we're seeing is we're seeing the continuation of the process that's been happening from the beginning, which is the field narrowing. We started this campaign a year ago with 17 candidates.More and more, the forces that do not want to see Donald Trump as our nominee, that don't want to see Donald go head to head with Hillary and lose, as he loses in just about every poll, Hillary trounces him -- more and more Republicans are unifying behind our campaign because we've got to win. We've got to beat Hillary, and we've got to turn this country around and bring back the jobs and opportunity that have been so sorely lacking under Barack Obama.HANNITY: Senator, to me, as an outsider looking in, I see a two-man race right now. And unless Senator Rubio or Governor Kasich can show some serious growth in the next couple of weeks, to me, it's a two-man race.CRUZ: Yes.HANNITY: And in many ways, as you read social media, it's the Trump, anti- Trump forces. Donald Trump says he wants a one-on-one race with you, and you say you want one with him. It seems the establishment won't allow that to happen. Is that a fair analysis?CRUZ: Well, listen, I think the other candidates in this race -- they're good people and they love their country. They love their country more than their own personal ambition. They're going to have to look at the race and see if they have a path ahead. And if they don't have a realistic path ahead to winning the nomination, then I think it's time to consider coming together and uniting.At this point, Donald and I in the delegate count, fewer than 100 delegates separate us. We both have over 300 delegates. We are very close. The momentum is with us. And we are the only campaign that has beaten Donald repeatedly, not once, not twice, but now seven times. And we're the only campaign that can and will beat Donald Trump.And so the process we're seeing -- you know, I would invite supporters of Jeb Bush or Chris Christie or Carly Fiorina or Ben Carson or Marco Rubio or John Kasich to come together and unite. That's what's been happening.  It's why we're winning these races. And I invite folks to continue to unite. We welcome you on our team, and we're going to win this nomination.  We're going to go on to win the general.HANNITY: I heard your comments about a brokered convention. Now, I interviewed at CPAC Governor John Kasich. He says, Oh, a brokered convention would be exciting.Why do I think that a brokered convention -- if neither you nor Donald Trump get to the magic number of 1,237 delegates, why do I believe that in that environment, knowing how the establishment feels about both of you, for different reasons, that it would be to stop you guys and give it to somebody else? Mitt Romney said, Well, I can't say no if somebody asks you to be on the ballot at that point.It seems that that is an effort that has even been spelled out by Governor Romney. That is troubling to me because that would...CRUZ: Yes.HANNITY: ... usurp the will of the people. If the person that has the most delegate doesn't get that nomination, why do I suspect shenanigans in the back room?CRUZ: Sean, you're exactly right. Listen, these visions of a brokered convention are the fevered fantasies of the Washington establishment, of the lobbyists who are so dismayed because they keep -- each of their favorite candidates keeps losing. They have candidates they want, and the voters don't want them. They want someone who will stand up to the bipartisan corruption of Washington, someone who will stand with the people.And you're right, if the party insiders try to subvert the will of the people and pick their own favorite candidate who hasn't earned the votes of the people, it will be a disaster. And rightfully people, will rise up outraged.Now, let me tell you right now, Sean, it ain't going to happen. They may think it's really a popular idea in Washington, D.C., but here's what's going to happen.The field is continuing to narrow. Head to head, not only do we beat Donald Trump, but we beat Donald Trump resoundingly. Donald has a hard ceiling of 35 to 40 percent. That's why we won Kansas overwhelmingly.  That's why we won Maine. That's why we won Alaska and Oklahoma. That's why we won Texas overwhelmingly, because Donald has a hard ceiling on the support that he can get. And head to head, we're not headed to a brokered convention. We are headed to a win, to 1,237 delegates...HANNITY: And let me ask you this...CRUZ: ... and that entails Republicans uniting.HANNITY: I know you have your issues with Donald. He has his issues with you. You two have gone back and forth now, and the voters will decide.But when you really think about it -- because I kind of view you as an insurgent outsider because you're hated by the establishment. And you can't deny he's an outsider, you know, just by the fact that he hasn't been in politics.So 18 out of 20 contests, Senator, have been won by outsiders. And the establishment is throwing money here, there and everywhere, and it's not working. What are they not getting in this process? They seem to be out of touch with where the voters are. What are they not understanding? I would argue that they caused this.CRUZ: Well, look, Sean, you're exactly right that the voters want an outsider. They're fed up. They're furious with Washington.The one think I disagree with you on is Donald Trump is not an outsider.  He is pretending to be an outsider. But in Donald's own words, seven months ago, he was the establishment. Donald Trump has been supporting the Washington establishment, the Washington corruption for four decades. He supported Jimmy Carter over Ronald Reagan. He supported Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden. He supported John Kerry over George W. Bush.  And he contributed multiple times to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.So to all the folks at home who are Donald Trump supporters, who are furious with Washington, I get that. But Donald has been funding and supporting everything you're furious about. The gang of eight amnesty bill, Donald funded the gang of eight. He supported five of the eight members of the gang of eight. I led the opposition to the gang of eight amnesty bill and we defeated it in the U.S. Congress.And so the people want someone who will stand up to Washington. Donald Trump has not only never stood up to Washington, but he has funded their corruption. And, you know, at the last debate, Sean, Donald promised everyone. He said he will be, quote, ""flexible."" We all know flexible is D.C. code word for they're getting ready to stick it to you, because whenever you're flexible, it means Donald is going to cut a deal that favors Wall Street and big business and leaves the working man out in the cold.  HANNITY: How do you feel about tomorrow? For example, you have got Michigan and Mississippi, two big states. You've got Idaho and Hawaii.  How well are you planning to do tomorrow?CRUZ: Look. I hope we do very well tomorrow. We are campaigning hard.  We were in Idaho two days ago, had incredible support and enthusiasm about Idaho. I think we are at a strong position right now. I'm right now in Mississippi. We have got tremendous excitement here in Mississippi. Later tonight I'm going to be in Michigan. We have got a huge rally planned in Michigan. Hawaii, I'm hopeful we'll continue the see what we have been seeing, which is conservatives uniting and coming together.If you want someone who has kept his word -- you know, when we had the Super Tuesday victory in Texas, it was particularly meaningful because the people of Texas, they're the ones who know me best. They know my heart.  They're the ones that I made promises to five years ago when I ran for Senate. I promised the people of Texas, if you elect me, I will fight with every breath in my body to stop Obamacare, to stop amnesty, to stop this debt that is bankrupting our kids and grandkids, to bring back jobs and economic growth and defend religious liberty and the Second Amendment. And the reason we won by landslide in Texas with the biggest turnout ever is because the men and women of Texas know I kept my word. I did what I said I would do. And that's what I'll do as president. And that's why I believe Republicans are uniting behind our campaign.HANNITY: We've got to take a break. We'll come back. We'll have more with more 2016 Republican president candidate Senator Ted Cruz right after the break.And then later tonight, reaction to the FOX News Democratic town hall.  Monica Crowley, Dr. Gina Loudon will be here to weight in, that and more as we continue tonight right here on HANNITY.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to HANNITY. And we continue now with 2016 Republican presidential candidate, Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Senator, walk us through your path to 1,237, because a lot of people, at least your opponents are arguing, let me just say that, that your better states are behind you. They keep repeating that. I'll let you respond to that, but more importantly, tell us what states you think you can win as you move forward that get you to that magic number.CRUZ: Well, you're right. My opponents keep repeating that, but they keep not winning states. The simple reality is there are only two candidates that have more than 300 delegates. That's Donald Trump and me. And we continue amassing delegates state by state. And the more this field narrows the stronger we get, because the truth of the matter is Donald has a hard ceiling of 35 percent to 40 percent, which means head to head we beat him, and we will beat him in state after state after state head to head, because Republicans want a real conservative. They don't want a candidate who supported Jimmy Carter and Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.  They want someone who will actually repeal Obamacare.And I'll tell you, Republicans are not interested in someone like Donald Trump who promises to be flexible on immigration, who tells ""The New York Times"" editorial board that he doesn't mean what he says about enforcing the immigration laws. We want someone who stands with the people and not with the corruption of Washington. And that's why the support for our campaign keeps growing and growing.HANNITY: One of the things that has frustrated me as a conservative over these many years is that for a Republican to win, they've got to run the table. They got to win Florida. They've got to win Ohio. They've got to win North Carolina, Virginia, New Hampshire, Iowa, New Mexico, you know, maybe Colorado, Nevada. It's a very -- it seems to be a more narrow path.  Historically it's been that way. Through the Bush years it was that way.  Do you think you can change the electoral map?CRUZ: Absolutely yes. This is a campaign designed to change the electoral map. Number one, we have got to bring conservatives back to the polls, and we are doing that. We are winning these states with record turnouts. You know, we won the state of Kansas with more votes just for our campaign than the entire primary field last cycle came out. We won with record turnouts in Alaska, in Maine and Texas and Oklahoma.We are seeing record turnouts, and it's bringing conservatives back, but it's also Reagan Democrats. It's the blue collar working class, the men and women with callouses on the hands who are right now divided between Donald Trump and me. We're bringing more and more of them over to us.We're also earning the votes of young people. And, Sean, it is real simple. If I'm elected president, we are going to repeal Obamacare. We'll adopt a simple flat tax. We'll abolish the IRS. We'll end amnesty. We'll pull back the EPA and the bureaucrats and we're going to see jobs explode.  Millions of high paying jobs, wages going up. Young people coming out of school with two, three, four job offers.HANNITY: I hope you can get your colleagues in Washington to go along with you because they've been very disappointing, senator, very disappointing.CRUZ: That is true, but there is nothing like a mandate from the people to focus minds in Washington. And we will come out just like the Reagan revolution in 1980 with a mandate from the people.HANNITY: I understand you have a special guest next to you that just endorsed you tonight. The Mississippi governor Phil Bryant is with you, is that correct?GOV. PHIL BRYANT, R-MISS.: Senator.CRUZ: Governor. That is indeed.BRYANT: Welcome to Mississippi.CRUZ: Thank you, governor.BRYANT: Sean, how are you?HANNITY: I'm good, Governor. How are you? Welcome to the program.BRYANT: I'm great.HANNITY: So why did you wait so long?BRYANT: You know, this is a difficult decision for a lot of us. a lot of us know candidates in there, but when it comes down to true conservative, as I am, Ted Cruz, Senator Cruz has exemplified that. He went to Washington, did what he said he would do. How rare is that? You just heard him talk about economic development. Mississippi is all about economic development. And the first thing we have to do, and I know he'll do as president of the United States, I have to do as governor, is protect the people against threats both foreign and domestic. And as you hear Ted Cruz a great passion talk about ISIL and ISIS and how we're going to go about defeating them, I believe him. I believe he's going to Washington and do what he's done because he's done that before.HANNITY: All right, thank you, governor, for being with us. Senator, I think we are putting together a one-hour town hall with you, later this week and hopefully we can get that worked out. We look forward to seeing you. I heard you were sick. I'm glad you're feeling with better, sir.CRUZ: Thank you, Sean. God bless, and everyone in Mississippi, Michigan, Idaho and Hawaii, come out and vote tomorrow. Come join our team. Let's stand together. We're going to turn the country around.HANNITY: All right, Senator Ted Cruz on the campaign trail, thank you, sir.When we come back, Monica Crowley, Dr. Gina Loudon, we'll have reaction to tonight's Fox News Democratic town hall, that and more as we continue on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" So earlier tonight, 2016 Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, wow, they participated in a town hall here on FOX News with Bret Baier. Here's some highlights.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: Neither you nor your lawyers have been apprised that you are a target of the investigation, is that true?HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Absolutely true.BAIER: Have you or your lawyers been apprised that any members of your current or former staff are targets of the investigation?CLINTON: Absolutely not. The State Department has a process for determining what is or isn't classified. If they determine it is, they mark it as classified.BAIER: Who decides?CLINTON: The State Department.BAIER: What about you when you're typing an e-mail?CLINTON: No. The state department decides. Nothing I sent or received was marked classified.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I believe that we have got to make public colleges and universities tuition free.There has been a massive transfer of wealth from the working class and the middle class to the top one tenth of one percent.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Joining us now with reaction, Monica Crowley and psychology expert, radio talk show host and TV host Dr. Gina Loudon is with us. Good to see you both.MONICA CROWLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, Sean.DR. GINA LOUDON, RADIO SHOW HOST AND PSYCHOLOGY EXPERT: Good to see you.HANNITY: I have seen enough of both of them. The bottom line for them is everything is free. Everything is free. No energy independence. We're going to sing Kumbaya and the world is going to like us. Everything is free. That's the message.CROWLEY: What's been interesting to watch in terms of Mrs. Clinton is her difficulty in trying to navigate the modern Democratic Party. Remember that ideologically and temperamentally she is on the radical left. She studied under Saul Alinsky. She is with the radicals in the party.HANNITY: Right.CROWLEY: But she saw her husband move the Democratic Party back to the center. It was a pragmatic, more moderate party under Bill Clinton, and he won not once but twice.HANNITY: Bernie scared her, didn't he?CROWLEY: Remember, it's less about Bernie than about Barack Obama. This Democratic Party where she is trying to get this until nation, is Barack Obama's Democratic Party. It's no longer Bill Clinton's Democratic Party.HANNITY: Well said.CROWLEY: So she's trying to navigate the radical left where Obama and most of the party are, which is why Bernie Sanders has this movement, and the more moderates where she saw really helped her husband win.HANNITY: I don't see any moderation in her. I see her doing two things.  Once she's trying to outflank Bernie in some ways. And then the second thing, Monica's right, she's wrapping her arms so tight around Obama saying, please don't let Loretta Lynch indict me. Please stop this pain and misery from coming my way. What do you think?LOUDON: I think they're probably behind the scenes have been promises made right along those lines, Sean. It wouldn't surprise me at all to see if there were a Hillary Clinton presidency to see a Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, for example.  HANNITY: So you think it could be a --LOUDON: Of course I think that. How can you not think that?HANNITY: Wow. So if Hillary wins, and says if I win I'll give you that Scalia seat?LOUDON: She may have to have offered him something because she wants his anointing. And she needed it in the beginning. This got really precarious for a while. She was unprepared for this. The DNC has a big problem here.  All the media wants to talk about and all the establishment wants to talk about are problems on the GOP side. But what happens when Bernie feels dissed, and that's how this will end, and his supporters don't have any place to go because they can't stand the establishment in their own party who is personified in Hillary Clinton?HANNITY: How do we interpret the enthusiasm gap? Republicans up 30 percent, 40 percent, 50 percent in some cases, the Democrats down by an equal amount. How do you interpret that?CROWLEY: Well, on the Republican side we finally have an exciting race, right? We have Donald Trump who is representing a populist strain. We have Senator Ted Cruz representing pure conservatism. We've got Marco Rubio representing more of the establishment.HANNITY: Who is more electable, Trump or Cruz?CROWLEY: I don't know. I would have a clearer answer on that, Sean, if we really get to a two-man race. If it ends up being Trump versus Cruz, then we can have a lot more things shake out and then we can decide who might be more electable in a general. I think they both have strengths going into a general.HANNITY: OK.CROWLEY: But what's interesting on the Democratic side, we're talking about all of the excitement happening on the GOP side. Wait until the drama breaks on the Democratic side. You guys talked about this and I've put out this theory since last summer where I do think there is a negotiation going on between Barack Obama and Hillary. But I think the FBI primary is the most important one on of all rather than the one against Bernie.HANNITY: I'm convinced. I've had Joe DiGenova on and Victoria Toensing, and all the evidence with this guy getting an agreement to testify with immunity after he had pled the fifth, tells me, one, they've got a grand jury in place, and, two, she's in trouble because by any objective discerning measure she has committed multiple felonies. Now, does the FBI director send a criminal recommendation along with findings in this investigation? If they do, OK, and they don't indict, that means he will resign or a group will resign and they'll leak everything anyway. She can't win under those circumstances, can she?LOUDON: No, absolutely not. And that's why I say it's the DNC who is imploding here. The focus is all on what's happening on the Republican side and all that drama, but all the real drama, the drama that is going to play out, the drama that is still unanswered is what in the heck are they going to do? It's all about Hillary. And that is why this will be so much fun going forward.HANNITY: Who do you think is more, electable, the question I asked Monica?LOUDON: Between Trump and Cruz? I have to say the way I see Donald Trump fight and win against Hillary when she tried to dust off Bill and trot him out there. And Donald Trump cut her off at the quick, Sean. So I have to believe --HANNITY: His argument is that he puts states in play that Cruz doesn't. I asked Ted Cruz tonight, you know, can you put other states in play? He thinks he can.CROWLEY: There are two things going on. One is style and one is substance. So to your point about substance, yes, I think Donald Trump might have the ability to put states like New York and Michigan into play where they would be lost to Democrats otherwise.HANNITY: Donald Trump could win New York, you think?CROWLEY: And also stylistically he's a street fighter.HANNITY: What about New Jersey? Can he win New Jersey, Pennsylvania?CROWLEY: He might. Remember, Ted Cruz is running a more traditional kind of campaign. I'm not sure he can put those states into play, but he might be able to attract other voters.LOUDON: And I think also, I also think that as Bernie starts to fade out, it has to happen.HANNITY: Bernie is done.LOUDON: He is done. And as that happens, how many of his voters are really going to swallow a Hillary Clinton nomination?HANNITY: Right now, the anger between Trump and Cruz people is as palpable as any moment I've seen in a primary. And some point there is going to be a winner and loser here.LOUDON: Unless some people can join together and that could be --HANNITY: I heard that three times today.CROWLEY: A unity ticket.HANNITY: A unity ticket.LOUDON: A unity ticket.HANNITY: A unity insurgent ticket.LOUDON: Yes.HANNITY: That would be pretty interesting.LOUDON: But conservatives have won, Sean. That's the exciting thing.HANNITY: Insurgents have won.We have got a break. We have more ""Hannity"" and a special tribute to of course Mrs. Reagan who died over the weekend straight ahead.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" Now, before we go tonight we want to send our condolences to the Reagan family. Former first lady Nancy Reagan sadly passed away yesterday at the age of 94. She'll remember for her elegance, for being the face of the national effort to prevent drug use in America, and for her unwavering love and support of her husband, one of the greatest presidents in our lifetime, Ronald Reagan. So with the family in our thoughts and prayers, and we wish you all the best. It's always hard to lose a loved one.That's all the time we have left this evening. As always, thanks for being with us. We'll see you back here tomorrow night.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.HOWARD KURTZ, HOST: On buzzmeter Sunday, sex scandals and suicide, Donald Trump turns to the tawdriest Clinton tales of the '90s and takes some heat from the media.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAKE TAPPER, CNN: Donald Trump bringing back a long-ago debunked theory as he hammers away on Clinton, but will regurgitating a lie even matter?JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC: I mean Donald Trump like the last couple of days brought up Wright with Sean Hannity and a sexual abuse and all that stuff 20 years after the fact.WILLIE GEIST, MSNBC: And Vince Foster.SCARBOROUGH: And Vince Foster, which is just despicable.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: That's a reference to discredited allegations about the suicide of Hillary Clinton pal and one-time White House aide, Vince Foster. How should the press cover Trump talking about that and Bill Clinton's sexual misconduct?Huge headlines over Hillary Clinton being hit hard by the State Department's internal watchdog for violating its rules with a private e- mail server. Is the press finally taking her on?Katie Couric under fire for a gun control documentary that contains a stunning example of misleading editing to make pro gun people look like morons.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KATIE COURIC, JOURNALIST: If there's no background checks for gun purchasers, how do you prevent felons or terrorists from purchasing a gun?(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: With Couric and company defending the film, we will bring you my interview with a gun rights activist who was at the filming and says she was shocked at the deceptions. Plus, the mystery man behind the Hulk Hogan lawsuit that threatens to bankrupt Gawker and why this is a classic case of revenge. I'm Howard Kurtz and this is ""MediaBuzz.""The media have grown accustomed at Donald Trump attacking Bill Clinton over his past sex scams, but this week he ratcheted things up in a way that many pundits found troubling.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL O'REILLY, FOX NEWS: I think it was today on the internet you put you up some stuff about Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton. It's kind of tawdry stuff and I'm not sure that this is a good thing to do that.DONALD TRUMP, PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: You talking about what I did, well, I'm only responding to what they do. She's been very nasty and I said I'd like him be on policy Bill.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: What is particularly stunning was Trump's discussion in response to questions from The Washington Post about the 1993 death of Vince Foster. Five investigations have confirmed that the one-time White House aide and Hillary Clinton confidant had killed himself despite conspiracy theories involving foul play that had persisted for more than two decades.(BEGIN VIEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Vince Foster's sister has called your comments to the Washington Post about cruel, irresponsible and wrong.TRUMP: Well, a question was asked about Vince Foster and it was asked of me -- what do you think of Vince Foster? I really know nothing about the Vince Foster situation. Haven't known anything about it, a lot of people are very skeptical as what happened and how he died.LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, MSNBC: Vince Foster's sister today broke her silence since the brother's suicide decades ago saying what Donald Trump has said about Vince Foster ""was wrong, irresponsible and cruel."" He thinks is not something that should really be part of the campaign.JOY REID, MSNBC: Right, conspiracy theories that he invite (ph) from Alex Jones or whatever it is that he gets his ideas.JAKE TAPPER: Mr. Trump has repeated and outrageous and long ago debunked falsehood about former Deputy White House counsel Vince Foster, a friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton's until his tragic suicide.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Pretty tough stuff. Joining us now to analyze the campaign coverage, Lisa Boothe, a Republican strategist and contributor to Washington Examiner, Susan Ferrechio, chief congressional correspondent for the Washington Examiner and then Penny Lee, a Democratic strategist and commentator. Lisa Boothe, Vince Foster's death ruled a suicide by no less than Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Does trump deserve the media criticism for bringing this up?LISA BOOTHE, WASHINGTON EXAMINER CONTRIBUTOR: Well, he does. I think there's an important distinction to make between Donald Trump talking about Bill Clinton's infidelity which is something that The Wall Street Journal editorial board not too long ago criticized for Hillary Clinton's role and as well of, you know, the Clinton's war on woman which is what that editorial was titled, to him pushing and peddling sort of this narrative about Vince Foster which drew criticism from his sister in the Washington Post.But this is kind of part of Donald Trump's whole thing where, you know, no press is bad press. All press is good publicity and part of the reason why he's been able to garner at least from the primary $2 billion of free media.KURTZ: Well, Trump is saying it's not pushing and peddling, in fact, he puts it out there, and here's an article in The New York Times, Susan Ferrechio, in the old days, Republicans would ""secretly place damaging information with friendly media like the Drudge Report on Fox News and with radio hosts like Rush Limbaugh,"" but now Trump says that times (ph) with his outrageous style doesn't need the middleman.SUSAN FERRECHIO, WASHINGTON EXAMINER CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, he's changed the rules and he can come out and say the stuff and its working because everybody is talking about it. Everybody is suddenly talking about a 1993 death of Vince Foster. Who would've thought that that would become part of the campaign dialogue? So, he's actually progress in trying to ruin Hillary Clinton's effort to win the woman's vote because he's bringing up all these past things that make her look less attractive to female voters. That's an important strategy for him because his biggest weakness is female voters.KURTZ: Yeah, it has also led to some broader pieces about Donald Trump and conspiracies. Here is NBC correspondent Hallie Jackson the other day. Do we have that?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HALLIE JACKSON, NBC CORESPONDENT: When Ted Cruz was still in the race, Trump speculated about a tabloid rumor linking Cruz's father to JFK's assassination.TRUMP: And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: So NBC basically called Trump a conspiracy theorist. Fair or unfair?PENNY LEE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I think it's fair. I mean, look, he's always out there often times and peddles these things. I mean, the whole thought...KURTZ: Well, he says that people have various questions about it.LEE: Yeah, and he talks about it and so the press covers it as quite a ""a process story"" but they're not really covering the actual conspiracy. Then we're covering it as a process story that he said this a new in a form (ph) and so therefore we must cover it. That is wrong. I mean, it was interesting to watch CNN.Just this week, you know, you had Jake Tapper push back hard on the Vince Foster saying it was after five investigations, as you related to, was ruled a suicide and then if you watch hour by hour by hour on CNN, they went back and back and back to ""these comments"" now that Trump was only quoting somebody else. If this is a conspiracy that we all know is fault (ph), stop the coverage.KURTZ: That reinforces your point Lisa which is in the process of even knocking it down and even criticizing Donald Trump and media criticism as we know (inaudible) him, the press acts as an echo chamber and gives this more attention.BOOTHE: And Donald Trump is the king at driving headlines. And this is what does it in a genius way. I don't think that he believes this stuff. What he does in such a genius way too, because I don't actually think he believes this stuff. What he does, he put it out there in a way that he can eventually walk back and say, well, I was asked this question. There was an article about it in the ""National Enquirer"" or whatever it is and he does it in a way his hands are off it but he puts it out there. He drives headlines. He consumes the media and there's this vacuum for reporters trying to fill what to report on, and he puts these things out there and it's just driving the headlines.KURTZ: Well, I wasn't serious about debating Bernie Sanders. That was just for fun. So, I have another standby Susan Ferrechio, and this one has to do with an interview that he gave in the '90s when he was a little bit more sympathetic to Bill Clinton when we were dealing in the days of Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky and all that sex related scandals. Take a quick look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bill Clinton, what does he need to do?TRUMP: Well, I don't know, and it's so embarrassing, and you really have to say where does it stop. Paula Jones is a loser, but the fact is that she may be responsible for bringing down a president indirectly.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: 1998, does it matter in 2016 that Trump had at least a different emphasis about Bill Clinton back then?FERRECHIO: Trump has come across as someone who people aren't sure how conservative he is. He's got a democratic past but nobody seems to care because frankly, I think he is really a post political candidate, and that's part of his popularity, that's part of the attraction. So, the fact that he has said these things in the past, I don't think make one bit of difference in the people who are supporting him and following him. The people who may wonder about though, who are watching this old clips, are the diehard conservatives who he currently really must court to win over for the 2016 election.KURTZ: For the media covering this stuff even though he is saying, you know, the election really should be about the economy and healthcare and Isis. It's a lot sexier than deconstructing for example an energy plan that Trump did put out.LEE: Sure, you saw this weekend in ""The New York Times"" coverage there's an article about Mrs. Clinton, you know, and they actually are criticizing her saying that she wasn't sexy or it wasn't entertainment enough and so there are people that are now worried about it.KURTZ: With sexy lines or sexy campaign...(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: Just to save you from the e-mails?(CROSSTALK)LEE: Thank you for that. It's specially saying, you know, she went into and trying to criticize an in-depth, I mean, in-depth policy issue and there was absolutely virtually no public thing (ph).KURTZ: We'll do that later in the program, but let me come to this. So, Donald Trump officially clinches the nomination, that magic 1,237 that we all obsessed on. He's now past it according to a count by the AP. But he's starting to get some other criticism about how he deals with Republicans, Lisa. A Morning Joe crowd basically said he's using slash and burn tactics this particularly after he went out to Mexico criticizing the Republican governor Susana Martinez -- Mitt Romney walks like a penguin and all that, but the press loves a Republican civil war, does it not?BOOTHE: Oh, they, I mean, they absolutely love it. Because you would look at the coverage on when it was thought of that there was going to be a contested convention with Republicans and then you look at the coverage when there's a very real chance that Democrats, the Democratic Party could potentially have a contested convention. I mean, there's just no parallel there. I mean, the amount of coverage that was focused on a potential contested convention for Republicans is drastically different from the coverage on the Democratic civil war that's going on right now.KURTZ: Maybe it doesn't matter whether Republican leaders like the reluctant Paul Ryan get behind Donald Trump. Maybe that's something that the media will obsess on because we deal with these people all of the time. Maybe what matters is what the rank and file Republicans are closing ranks behind him so he can then complete this so-called pivot (ph) and go after some Democrats and independents.FERRECHIO: I'm not really sure it matters who inside the belt what it gets behind Donald Trump because so far, it hasn't mattered one bit. If it really mattered, Howard, he would not be the nominee because, I think if anything...KURTZ: So, why does he get so much attention? Why every time Paul Ryan clears his throat there's a story?FERECHIO: Because there are, you know, 150 reporters running around the Capitol reporting on it and obsessing over it. My frustration is when I go to the weekly press conference with Paul Ryan, I can't get in a question about what's happening with legislation, which is very important and it's being dropped by reporters because every question is about when he's going to endorse Donald Trump.How much does it matter in the election? Probably not a heck of a lot since a lot of voters don't like the GOP establishment the way it's functioning right now. They like Trump because he's not part of the inside.KURTZ: At one of these speeches this week where Trump went off on Romney and Susana Martinez and others -- by the way, Susana Martinez says she's going to be buoyed (ph) Donald Trump so she responded rather (inaudible) -- he also went to Bill Kristol, who is the editor of ""The Weekly Standard,"" a long time force and conservative movement in Republican politics and who has been trying to draft somebody to mount a third party conservative challenge to Trump and Hillary Clinton. Here is what Trump had to say about Kristol.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: His name is Bill Kristol. From day one, this poor guy -- this poor guy -- I watch him, but here's what I don't understand, why do you keep putting a guy on television that's been proven to be wrong for so many years. He's been doing this for like nine months he can't find anybody. What a loser.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Is that a waste of Trump's time to go after some pundit who's gotten under his skin?LEE: Oh, it is typical Donald Trump. I mean, anybody that gets in his way that says anything negative about him, that's his attack and he goes right...KURTZ: Well, this has been very negative. He has definitely lied (ph) to him in about (inaudible) five minutes of the speech.LEE: And so much for the pivot. I mean, there's been a pivotal moment when he now, you know, goes and uses the words like senator and more (inaudible) kind of words and he obviously not. There's a real battle right now and whether or not this is going to be a base election or this is going to be an expanded electorate. And so I think what Donald Trump is doing right now is very shrewd and very smart and that's to go back and to ensure the Republican base the impact of this.KURTZ: Because he loves beating up on the press, we know that. We're a very fat target. Let me get a break. Let us know what you think. E-mail us mediabuzz@foxnews.com and stick to the media or stick it to the media. When we come back the Trump campaign responds. Katrina Pierson is standing by.And later, did Katie Couric engaged in deception for a gun control documentary. This is the story the other networks just aren't covering. We'll talk to an activists who was at the filming.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Time now for response from the Trump campaign. Joining us from Dalla is Katrina Pierson, a spokeswoman for Donald Trump. So, we began the show by talking about the media hammering your boss for bringing up the thoroughly investigated Vince Foster suicide in 1993. And I know that the Washington Post raised it with him first, but why go there?KATRINA PIERSON, DONALD TRUMP SPOKESWOMAN: Well, I mean, it's quite simple Howie. I mean, look, Mr. Trump answers questions by the media. This is nothing new. And when you have a candidate like Hillary Clinton who is riddled with scandals, whether it's Whitewater, Travelgate, Benghazi, e-mail for that matter, when he's asked he's going to respond and look, it's not Donald Trump's responsibility to protect Hillary Clinton on any scandal.KURTZ: Well, I suggest that she has some responsibility on the Vince Foster death, which I don't think there's any evidence we have. But since you pivoted very adeptly to Hillary Clinton, let me play for you is a sound bite. This is Donald Trump talking to Bill O'Riley the other night and lays some question about Hillary Clinton's only (ph) television appearances. Let's watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: She goes on very few shows and I know there's the other night she was on a show and they gave her set of questions and they negotiate their questions. I don't think you can ever say that I negotiate my questions with you.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: So, Hillary Clinton had been on ""Meet the Press"" and CNN and days before that. What evidence does he have that anyone has given here any set of questions in advance?PIERSON: Well, a lot of the media actually talks about this and early on in the campaign when Mrs. Clinton was on the campaign trail, she wasn't doing any media interviews and I can't remember the last time she's gone on a Fox program particularly O'Reilly, Hannity even Megyn Kelly for that matter. She does do the softball interview questions and no one asks her the tough questions in the media and I heard your segment earlier with CNN actually doing the cover up work for Hillary Clinton when it comes t the things that Mr. Trump is saying. They're going out of their way to defend her without her defending herself.KURTZ: Wait, I got to push back on this. You say that CNN's Jake Tapper, by stating that there have been several investigations of Vince Foster's death and now it's been debunked that the Clinton's had anything to do with the sad tragedy is covering up for Hillary Clinton. I don't follow?PIERSON: Well, they're defending. They're constantly defending -- there are several anchors on many of the other networks who are constantly defending Hillary Clinton whether it's a scandal or even with the e- mails for that matter and you just don't see that on the other side.We have known for a very long time that Republicans have you tough time in the media particularly in a presidential election and Donald Trump is that kind of candidate that they're having trouble fighting back against because he does stand for himself and he defends himself and he's not going to be silenced by the mainstream media.KURTZ: Well, you can characterize the enemies (ph) how the way you want. She certainly has done far fewer than Donald Trump and I know nothing she has gotten any questions in advance. All right, so ""The New York Times"" big piece this weekend will show you the scuffles roiling the Trump campaign, growing sense of paranoia, internal combat, has undermined ""The Daily Message,"" I mean, the two Times reporter asked for comment, they got a statement that said, ""to Ashley Parker and Maggie Haberman, you two wouldn't know how to write a good story about me if you tried -- dream on."" What about the substance of the Times piece?PIERSON: Look, I've been hearing since Mr. Trump entered this race, the Trump campaign is in turmoil, the staff is not getting along. Howie, we just beat 16 other candidates. Mr. Trump is the Republican nominee...KURTZ: That's true.PIERSON: ...we're now building out. We are now building out to a national team and so these types of reports are just -- they're just false. There are going to be times when everyone is talking and even consulting with each other that may agree or disagree, but that doesn't mean that there's something as intrinsically wrong with the campaign. But more importantly, we hear a lot of these sources come from ""anonymous people inside the campaign"" which I have to challenge because a lot of the things that I have heard coming from these anonymous sources are flat out false.KURTZ: Well, every campaign I've ever covered ahs internal tensions and all from the press piece that sometimes blows it up, but...PIERSON: Absolutely.KURTZ: ... interesting tweets from Donald Trump about this or he had a series of them, ""don't believe the bias and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me."" What about other people that are quoting? What about when we talk to you?PIERSON: Well, I think the key term is phony and as I mentioned you have these anonymous sources supposedly inside the campaign, and those are just phony reports. So, that's what Mr. Trump is talking about. If they're quoting people who don't have a name, then that's a problem. We consider that to be phony and I'm giving you that answer as a national campaign spokesperson, Mr. Trump was speaking specifically to those phony reports.KURTZ: I am skeptical about named sources as well by their (ph) civil rights with names attached...PEIRSON: As we all should be.KURTZ: ...it has a little more credibility by seeing you say it on camera...PIERSON: Absolutely.KURTZ: ...then I take it a little more seriously. Kat, great to see you. Thanks for stopping by this Sunday.PIERSON: Great to be here. Thanks.KURTZ: Ahead, Bill Cosby is heading to trial on sexual assault charges. Will that become the ultimate media circus? But up next, the Silicon Valley billionaire who secretly got his revenge against Gawker.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: There's a bizarre new twist in that Gawker case. Now, a judge has upheld a $140 million verdict to Hulk Hogan over the posting of that sex tape involving the wrestler and his best friend's wife.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HULK HOLGAN, PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER: All I wanted was to let everyone know what Gawker is all about and what they do to destroy lives.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: The New York Times has revealed that a mystery man secretly bankrolled the see what were the motive, the money, and the message that the gossipy site is a threat to journalism. He is Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire, co-founder of PayPal and a Facebook board member. Now, years ago, a Gawker blog published a story under the headline, ""Peter Theil is Totally Gay people,"" outing (ph) the businessman who is not totally public about his sexuality.Thiel told columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin that this and other articles about his friends ruined people lives for no reason. ""I saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredibly damaging way of getting attention by bullying people even when there was no connection with the public interest."" Thiel said that these were very painful and paralyzing for people who were targeted. Gawker founder Nick Denton defended the original story about Thiel being gay at CNBC.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BECKY QUICK, CNBC I don't think that outing someone's sexual presence is fair game.NICK DENTON, GAWKER FOUNDER: Well actually, I'm a gay man. The author of the...QUICK: It doesn't mean that, you know...DENTON: The author of the story on Peter Thiel is a gay man. Why on earth maintaining this kind of -- this code of silence around a gay public figures -- in a way that you would never do about a straight person.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Denton who is now exploring a sale of Gawker warned against the danger of rich guys carrying out a revenge fantasy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DENTON: The billionaire behind the curtain, pulling strings, hiring law firms, pursuing a decade long -- a decade long strategy. It's kind of extraordinary and I'm slightly impressed.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Joining us from Stanford, California is Farhad Manjoo, technology columnist for The New York Times. So, what do you make of Peter Thiel telling your paper this is actually philanthropy on his part, striking a blow against mean spirited journalism?FARHAD MANJOO, NEW YORK TIMES TECHNOLOGY COLUMNIST: Yeah, that is a crazy idea that this is sort of somehow in the public interest. I mean, in this one instance you can say because of (inaudible) that Gawker, you know, went over the line but this one suit about Hulk Hogan was one of many -- is one of many that Thiel seems to be funding and I think the real danger here is that if you have billionaires funding lawsuits against the press in secret, you're going to, I mean, that like sort of inherently has a chilling affect on the press. And there are in stances, I mean, where you could have many people file lawsuits that they have no merit and still sort of ruined a small publication like Gawker.KURTZ: Well, I also, you know, I'm troubled by the idea billionaires who maybe just don't like the media outlet (ph) for ideological reasons, secretly funding the lawsuits. But the lawsuits have no merit, they probably will be thrown out. In this particular case, you know, Gawker kind of handed him a sword because posting this sex tape, a jury had to be convinced that there was a case here and obviously they awarded a verdict of many, many, many millions of dollars, your thoughts.MANJOO: Yeah, I would be cautious about thinking that if lawsuits have no merit, they'll be thrown out. I mean, one of the things that tech billionaires and other billionaires have said for a long time, is that the legal system doesn't work as cleanly as that. I mean, Peter Thiel is a funder of many small companies. If those companies were attacked by the legal system for example like Uber or (inaudible) or various other startups who are hit by huge lawsuits that, you know, calls for a hundred million dollar judgment for every wrong person.I think that they would, you know, not think that that's good for startups generally for businesses and for the industry. There are many in stances we found, you know, people suing news companies and the legal costs even if the suits are trivial (ph), the legal costs exceed, you know, what many companies can afford.KURTZ: I was going to make that point. It's a great one. We'll see you later in the show for (inaudible). And one little footnote there, Gawker is a liberal website who's editor told me last fall that Trump who has Republican rivals will be apocalyptically disastrous president. Peter Thiel is going to be at the Republican Convention, a Trump delegate. So when Farhad comes back later in the program, we will ask him this question. Will Trump's tweeter tirade somehow back fire?But coming up, Hillary Clinton getting pounded even by liberal news outlets over the investigative report on her e-mail debacle.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Hillary Clinton's e-mails scandal had been fading from the headlines when the State Department Inspector General issued a stinging report.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WOLF BLITZER, CNN: But the report specifically say the State Department did not and would not have approved your exclusive reliance at a personal e-mail account. So, here's the question, did you break the rules?HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well Wolf, you know, this report makes clear that personal e-mail use was the process under other secretaries of state and the rules were not clarified until after I have leftdid.CHUCK TODD, NBC NEWS: Yesterday State Department I.G. report was pretty scathing and it seemed to contradict many of the things that you said about the e-mails.CLINTON: Well, Chuck, the report makes clear that personal e-mail use was the practice under other secretaries of state.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: We're back with the panel. Lisa Boothe, Wolf Blitzer and Chuck Todd weren't the only ones who were oppressing Hillary Clinton on this. Do you see a change in the media's tone on this e-mail?BOOTHE: Well, I think for now, I mean, that's going to change as the election progresses here and I think they're going to get a little bit softer on Hillary Clinton.KURTZ: Right now?BOOTHE: Right now, no. I think that criticism was well deserved. I mean, you look at the ""Washington Post"" editorial and it was scathing (ph) towards Hillary Clinton. But she deserved that. I mean, what she did was outside of the protocol of the State Department and she broke protocol and she broke rules.KURTZ: Penny, the ""Washington Post"" and ""The New York Times"" both had pretty tough editorials and these are liberal editorial pages obviously slamming her. Is it fair to say that the liberal media basically aren't buying Hillary Clinton's explanation in the wake of this I.G. report?LEE: I think the media has been going after this issue for a very long time and you see this story being covered for more over than 12 months and so what happened there are some things they have avoided. They are asking the appropriate questions. There is a new report that came up that did warrant those questions so yes, I think it was appropriate in the role in which the media played, was to have those questions asked.KURTZ: People forget the story it was recently broken by ""The New York Times"" more than a year ago, Susan Ferrechio, but it kind of ran out of gas in recent months. I think when it was covered, the cover (ph) seemed incremental because we don't know what's going on with the FBI investigation. So, why the striking change here? Is it because -- is it just because there's a new report or is it also because she seems to be sticking the her talking points on this?FERRECHIO: I'm trying (ph) to think the media knows its credibility is on the line here, that the media is not trusted anymore and the mainstream media is aware of this and then giving that -- I think this is bare minimum coverage I my opinion even though they did cover what came out this week because they had to and she -- the mainstream media can play this up as much as they want or as little as they want. If she were a Republican, can you imagine the swarms of reporters who would be keeping this out the press every single day? I honestly believe the coverage would be a lot different if she had an R after her name.LEE: Yes, because, I mean, there's has not been a lack of coverage on this issue and so, I mean to say it's kind of one of those things that there's only so much news that you can report on. So, there hasn't been any new news per se. So, this report did beg some of the questions that are being asked. But this has been long, long chronicles in their reports.BOOTHE: To Susan's point, if this was a republican, they would be asked to step down. They will be forced to step down. There's absolutely no...LEE: You can't make that leave (ph).(CROSSTALK)BOOTHE: Yes, absolutely. If you have a candidate who is facing a criminal investigation by the FBI, there's absolutely no way.LEE: While she's stepping down from.BOOTHE: No way, when she stepped down she's a private citizen.LEE: She's the first candidate in history to be facing investigation by the FBI.(CROSSTALK)LEE: If you look at the fraudulent scandals..BOOTHE: An investigation is not for (ph) Republicans, even it's a sex scandal. Whatever it is, they are forced to step down...(CROSSTALK) LEE: Republican leadership calling for Donald Trump to step down on his past allegations?(CROSSTALK)BOOTHE: But what if he had done that in the nature...(CROSSTALK)KURTZ: Yes, she is under criminal investigation and she's also presumed innocent (ph) in the legal sense not necessarily in the political sense, and she is also -- although she cannot shake Bernie Sanders, she is winning these primaries and so I don't know that's it (inaudible) to ask any candidate to step down, even Bernie Sanders because he's not winning.Before we go, Mrs. Clinton has been asked in various interviews about the Vince Foster business, about her husband's sex life. She always seems to deflect it. I always say, you know, maybe that's a smart strategy. I always say she has trouble making news. I mean, Trump has this news tornado and she is like the breeze, is that a problem anybody?FERRECHIO: Yeah, I think Trump's hitting below the belt, she's hitting above the belt, and he's -- had been more successful with his below the belt punches. He's getting more attention. No one is talking about the fact that she said he's not qualified. They're all talking about criticizing over the Vince Foster and Clinton affairs.KURTZ: On the other hand, Hillary Clinton, above the belt as you say, you know, how it made major push this week about Donald Trump once having said he like the idea of the housing market collapses because he could make more money. Looks like a one day story.LEE: Well, I mean, it's a responsibility to even lift the debate up into the upper registers that we do talk about more policy and not make it about politics of personalities. I think that...BOOTHE: She should also be called out for that because Bill Clinton wasn't the one that rewrote the role (h) to the Community Reinvestment Act which helped lead and spearhead, you know, help lead us towards the housing bubble and the financial crisis.KURTZ: That's a perfectly good debate.BOOTHE: But she's not being called out for that.KURTZ: That's a perfectly good debate, but my point is that here is, you know, you have some words that in retrospect might seem a little embarrassing for Donald Trump. He was a business man entitled to make money any way he could for closures and that sort of thing, but how much media actually has that gotten compared to the latest sexual allegations?BOOTHE: Well, to answer a point, I mean think of it as juxtaposition between the way that Hillary Clinton handles the media and the way that Donald Trump handles the media. That's going to be problematic for Hillary Clinton because this is a guy who, as I mentioned before, earned $2 billion in free media and the Republican primary. This is a woman who went months without even talking to the press for a period of time.KURTZ: He did own that media and some there was not so favorable, all right. Lisa Bloothe, Penny Lee, Susan Ferrechio, great to see you this Sunday.BOOTHE: Thank you.KURTZ: Next on ""MediaBuzz"" with Katie Couric under fire for deceptive editing on a gun control documentary. We talked to gun rights activist who was involved in the film and is now pretty angry. And later, Facebook makes some fixes but does not resolve the issue of anti- conservative bias.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Katie Couric knew she was wading into a political minefield by undertaking a documentary on gun control. The film ""Under the Gun"" which just debuted on the EPIX Network seems to build a case for tighter background checks.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do you feel about the fact that a person on the government's terror watch list can't board a plane but can legally buy a gun?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Say that again.COURIC: In America, there are more guns stores than Starbucks and McDonald combined.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On the terror watch list? That's a good one.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Couric, told her old pal Matt Lauer that she tried to put aside her personal feelings after they had covered the carnage of Columbine.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)COURIC: I wanted to have an open mind. I wanted to have understand the psyche of gun owners in this country and what they were afraid of.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Philip Van Cleave who participated in the filming as the president of the Virginia Citizen's Defense League, although his two- hour interview with Katie was left on the cutting room floor, said things seemed to go out.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PHILIP VAN CLEAV, VIRGINIA CITIZENS DEFENSE LEAGUE PRESIDENT: It was a very polite, nice back and forth. I came out thinking that indeed she was going to do a fair job of representing us.KURTZ: But now Couric and the filmmakers are under fire over a dramatic moment featured in the movies trailer.COURIC: If there are no background checks for gun purchasers, how do you prevent felons or terrorists from purchasing the guns?(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Eight seconds of stunned silence but that sequence, with members of the Virginia Guns Rights group was edited in a misleading way. Hear from an audio tape made by the organization is what actually happened.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)COURIC: How do you prevent felons or terrorists from walking into say, a licensed gun dealer and purchasing the gun?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, one if you're not in jail, then you should still have your basic rights and you should be able to buy a gun.COURIC: So, if you're a terrorists or felon?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you're a felon and you've done your time, you should have your rights.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The fact is, we do have statues both at the federal and state level that prohibit classes of people from being in possession of firearms.(END AUDIO CLIP)KURTZ: Philip Van Cleave told me he was shocked.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VAN CLEAVE: The problem was is that it made our members look like they were idiots. Like they couldn't answer a basic straight forward question. Their eyes were diverted in the video. They were looking down almost like they were shamed. I think because of how -- the light that it cast on our members and our organization and gun owners in general, that Katie Couric does indeed owe us an apology for what she did. It's the least she could do.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: But that's not what happened. The famous director, Stephanie Soechtig says in a statement, ""My intention was to provide a pause for the viewer to have a moment to consider this important question before presenting the facts on Americans' opinions on background checks. I never intended to make anyone look bad and I apologize if anyone felt that way."" In her own statement, Couric, the movie's executive producer said she agree with her director and is very proud of the film. Couric would not agree to be interviewed. A source familiar with Couric's role said she questioned the edited silence but deferred to the director's judgment.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VAN CLEAVE: I wonder how Katie would like it if we took some video of her and ask the question to her that made her show seemed dumbfounded. I wonder if she'd like that (ph).(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: It isn't hard to see that Couric's director has strong views on gun control. An interview this month with ""The Guardians,"" Stephanie Soechtig spoke of the outrage of this strangle hold that National Rifle Association has over the legislative process, and she said, ""Gun owners are being duped to being sold a bill of goods by the NRA."" The Virginia Citizens Defense League isn't one of those groups that is constantly ripping (ph) the media. In fact, Van Cleave told me he's had positive experiences with outlets from 60 Minutes to Nigtline.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VAN CLEAVE: I think overall, the media has been relatively fair to us. They've never been -- well, there have been four cases where they've really done kind of a Katie did, but other than that, overall it's been fair. We usually don't get as much time as the other side, but I don't care as long as the main part of our message gets out. That's all I care about.KURTZ: But he is still angry at Katie Couric.VAN CLEAVE: It wasn't fair. It wasn't right. It wasn't professional and it was very bad journalism.(END VIDEO CIP)KURTZ: What Couric's director did, was to use editing to distort what actually happened. That distortion first noted by the Washington Free Beacon would be against the rules of any network news division. There's really no defending it. I've interviewed Katie Couric many times. She's having an amazing and successful career from Today Show co-host to CBS Evening News anchor to her current role as Yahoo's chief global news anchor. She may have set out to show all sides of the gun control issue, but that one deceptive bit of editing has given her critics a very big target.After the break, Trump's tweeter feed was a powerful weapon showing the primaries, but our friends in the ""New York Times"" said that this can damage the Donald. We'll be here.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Donald Trump is a force of nature on Twitter where he's got eight million very passionate followers, but New York Times tech columnist says that now, his strategy could backfire big time. Let's go back to California and bring in Farhad Manjoo. So, you say Trump is effective on Twitter because he sounds like a real person but you also say that his Twitter army can be domineering in its attempts to harangue and silence critics, explain.MANJOO: Yeah, I mean, one of the things he does really well on Twitter is sound authentic. I mean, people like Donald Trump on Twitter for the same reason they like him kind of in the media generally because he sounds like a real person. If you look at other politicians Twitter accounts, they sound like press releases basically.I mean, Hillary Clintons does speak sort of in the third person on Twitter and, yes. So, Trump has kind of mastered this medium. The question now is whether it could help him in the general election the way it helped him in the primary election, and that's where I wonder -- I worry that he may think of it as being effective here, but I think it probably isn't.KURTZ: Well, somebody who lives on Twitter explaining why the more targeted audience he has originally in the primaries might have been one thing but now you say Twitter is ill-suited to the mass messages that he needs to get out, why?MANJOO: Yeah, so, I mean Twitter works really well to kind of get at your base and it's a mass media platform. It's basically the same as kind of cable news. It works -- you get everyone listening to you at the same time, and Twitter has this compounded effect where what he says on twitter kind of gets on cable and so he can kind of get everywhere.But in a presidential and a general election these days, especially when it's supposed to be very close, what the Obama campaign did really well in 2008 and 2012 was use this sort of online fervor to kind of get real people out in the real world during work for you. You know, they tied kind of what was happening online with e-mail addresses and real names and raising money, but the Trump campaign really hasn't done that and Twitter is a really bad tool for that.KURTZ: Well, let me just jump in because Donald Trump has said he doesn't really totally believe in the whole sort of data-driven approach to politics. He also may not have the money to do it, but, just to come back to Twitter for a moment, you say that Twitter has a 140-character medium, tends to penalized nuance and moderation while rewarding hot takes and bombast but maybe hot takes and bombast in this environment is what it takes to win an election.MANJOO: I mean, hot takes and bombast definitely get you in the media and as your whole show has pointed out so far is that, you know, he has been able to drown out everyone else's message and Hillary Clinton's lately, but, you know, that's not really how presidential elections are won in kind of battleground states. It's going to be a few percentage point difference, and the way that works is you get people online to do work for you offline.You know, the major thing is to sort of get people who are your supporters to get non-supporters of people who are in the center voting for you, and there's no evidence that Twitter works that way. I mean, Twitter is really good at kind of, as you said, like getting the really -- the red meat out, right? Like you can get people -- you can get people whipped up that way. When Trump has kind of gone to the center and tried to pivot, you know, the Cinco de Mayo tweet was an example of that where he showed himself eating a taco bowl.KURTZ: Yeah.MANJOO: That has ended up -- I mean it sort of backfired. He did dominate the media but mostly people were making fun of him.KURTZ: That may have been a misstep, but I think you did point out that Trump's twitter feed was kind of like its own wire service. It does drive a lot of publicity (ph). I would say it drives news coverage everywhere, your newspaper, magazines, et cetera, so, therefore, I take your point but I think it's not to be underestimated. Farhad Manjoo from ""The New York Times."" Thanks for getting up early out in California, great to see you.MANJOO: Hey, good to be here.KURTZ: Still to come, Facebook changes its rules in response to allegations of liberal bias, but is it enough, and with Bill Cosby heading to trial, will the media go utterly haywire?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Facebook insists it was not biased in picking its trending topics but Mark Zuckerberg's companies is making some changes and go beyond better training and oversight for the journalist hired to help pick the topics. Facebook will no longer assign an importance level based on top ten news sites which are mostly mainstream outlets like ""The New York Times,"" the ""Washington Post"" CNN although it does include Fox News.But Facebook is essentially admitting here is that journalists being human have biases and relying heavily on establishment outlets does tilt things away from key sources on the right as well as the left and Zuckerberg deserves credit for trying. I'll give that a like. It's been more than a decade since allegations of sexual assault first surfaced against Bill Cosby long ignored by most of the media. This week the comedians fortunes took a turn for the worst.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHARLIE ROSE, CBS NEWS HOST: It is a stunning fall from grace. Bill Cosby who portrayed the all-American TV dad was ordered today to stand trial in Pennsylvania for sexual assault.DAVID MUIR, ABC WORLD NEWS TONIGHT ANCHOR: Bill Cosby, once nicknamed America's dad, will now face his first criminal trial for alleged sexual assault.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Prosecutors say Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted Amanda Constand in his suburban Philadelphia mansion back in 2004. She, of course, is one of more than just 50 women who have made similar, remarkably similar allegations against Cosby. USA Today called this the biggest celeb case since Michael Jackson -- I guess that's true -- and the media interest will be intense given Cosby's now tarnished status as a TV trail blazer and cultural icon. I just hope, and maybe this is wishful thinking, but I just hope that my profession doesn't put itself on trial by turning this criminal case into an O.J.-like media circus.KURTZ: Well, that's it for this edition of ""MediaBuzz.""

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Chris Wallace.  Donald Trump clinches the GOP nomination for president, but his attacks on fellow Republicans continue.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Poor Mitt Romney.  Poor Mitt, he choked like a dog.Many of the people I have competed against have now endorsed me.  No, Jeb hasn't done it yet.  He will get a burst of energy and he will do it.  Believe me.WALLACE:  As he sets his sights on the general election.  TRUMP:  Crooked Hillary, she's as crooked as they come.  WALLACE:  Today, a preview of Trump's strategy going forward, with campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.  It's a ""Fox News Sunday"" exclusive.  Then, the scathing report from the State Department inspector general on Hillary Clinton's use of a private e-mail server.  HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  It was still a mistake.  If I could go back, I would do it differently.  WALLACE:  We'll discuss what Clinton did and the political fallout with two key members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff and Republican Senator James Lankford.  Plus, President Obama calls out Trump while meeting with foreign leader.  BARACK OBAMA, D-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They're rattled by him, and for good reason.WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel whether the president will help or hurt Democrats in this election.  All right now on ""Fox News Sunday.""  (END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  And hello again on this Memorial Day weekend from Fox News in Washington.  Well, it's been another rollercoaster week for Donald Trump.  He clinched the GOP nomination, appeared to sign on to a debate with Bernie Sanders, was targeted by President Obama and attacked fellow Republicans.  Despite calls from party leaders to unify, just another week in Trump world.  Joining me now from New York is Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.Corey, let's start with the highly anticipated Trump-Sanders debate.  At first, Trump said that he would love to debate Sanders and then he backed out saying that it was inappropriate to debate the second place Democrat which he knew Sanders was from the start.  Here's what Sanders had to say about all of that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT., DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Trump claims to be a tough guy, pushes people around.  Hey, Donald, come on up.  Let's have a debate about the future of America.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Corey, as the senator asked, what is Trump afraid of?  LEWANDOWSKI:  Also, hey, first, thank you for having me on and second, I want to thank all of our he veterans as we celebrate Memorial Day, or remember Memorial Day.  But as you know, that that question that was asked of Mr. Trump was asked in gesturing Jimmy Kimmel when he said, sure, if they want to pay me enough money, as a joke, tongue in cheek, I'll be happy to debate Bernie Sanders.  The bottom line is the Democratic Party is stealing this election from Bernie Sanders.  The party bosses will not allow him to be the nominee.  Hillary Clinton is going to be the nominee and we're squarely focused on defeating Hillary Clinton come November.  So, for us, if Hillary Clinton is going to debate Bernie Sanders, because he's not going to be the nominee, we're solely focused on making sure that the American people know that Donald Trump is going to be the next president for the United States and lay out vision for that.  We're not going to waste our time debating Bernie Sanders when he's not going to be the Democratic nominee.  WALLACE:  All right.  Trump wasn't just fighting Democrats, but he also was taking on Republicans.  He, for instance, he went after the Republican governor of New Mexico, Susana Martinez.  Here he is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  The governor has to do a better job.  She's not doing the job.  Hey, maybe I'll run for governor of New Mexico.  I'll get this place going.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Corey, why on earth would the now Republican nominee since he's clinched the nomination, why would he call out the poplar governor of a swing state like New Mexico who just happens to be the head of the Republicans Governor Association?  LEWANDOWSKI:  Well, here's what happened, Chris, and you know this.  Every time Mr. Trump goes to speak somewhere, he lays out the problems with that given location, whether it's Ohio or Michigan, or Indiana, you know, your country is a mess right now.  Our jobs are leaving.  Our trade deals are killing us.  People are worse now than they were 10, and 12, and 15 years ago and those statistics that he outlined are the statistics of the state of New Mexico.And what he is saying is, as a president of the United States, he will bring jobs back to our country.  He will make sure Americans are first.  That doesn't matter if we're in New Mexico or if we're in Indiana, or if we're in Michigan, people are hurting.  And we need a president that's going to bring back our jobs back.  And so, outlining the economy of a specific location is something that he has done across the country everywhere we've gone because we need to highlight the problems that we have and what we're going to do to fix those problems.  WALLACE:  But I think you would agree that former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has been very supportive of your campaign.  Here's what he had to say about Trump's comments this week.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER:  I think that the attack last night was very, very destructive.  I think it sent all the wrong signals.  You particularly don't want to see your candidate who needs to vote, get stronger with Latinos, and stronger with women, attacked a Latina woman Republican governor.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Gingrich went on to say that Trump sometimes, quote, ""goes off the deep end.""That doesn't sound like something you want in a president.LEWANDOWSKI:  Well, Chris, what you have here is there's no attack on a Latino or a woman governor.  What this was, was laying out the economic perspective of what the state of New Mexico was doing and he's saying we need to do a better job.  That's what our country needs, is we need to create jobs, we need to have more people back to work, we need to build a wall, we need to stop illegal immigration.  These are things that are said everywhere we go.  And so, you know, if Donald Trump is winning with Latinos, if you look at the last poll, he's winning with Hispanics.  If you look at the polls, he's doing very well with woman.  He has a much more --WALLACE:  Wait --  (CROSSTALK)LEWANDOWSKI:  He is so close that in the state of California, Donald Trump is now, the state of California is now in plane.  Clinton is scared to death.  (CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  But, Corey, wait, he's not winning with woman and he's not winning with Hispanics.  His numbers are hugely underwater with both.And on the specific question of this, he didn't just say, well, gee, things could be better in New Mexico.  He said, I'm looking at the quote here, ""she,"" the governor, ""is not doing the job.""  He is going to go around the country saying that the Republican governors in states are not doing the job?LEWANDOWSKI:  It's not about being the Republicans.  It's not about being the Democrats, it's about doing what's right for the country.  If this was said in the state of Nevada, if that would have been Democrat female governor, this wouldn't be an issue.  It's about the economy.So, you guys want to make a story about something that doesn't exist here, let's make it right.  We need to do a better job.  We need to stop illegal immigration, we need to put people back to work, we need to cut taxes.  That's what this is about.  So, anything else other than that is not the case.  But the bottom line is, our country is in trouble, and we don't put someone in the White House who can actually knows how to create jobs and get things down, our country is going to continue to deteriorate to a point where the middle class will disappear, and we can't have that.  WALLACE:  So, bottom line, do you stand by, does he stand by his comment that Susana Martinez could be doing a better, is not doing everything she can to help the people of New Mexico?LEWANDOWSKI:  Well, this is not a Republican issue.  It's not a Democrat issue.  It's about the economy.WALLACE:  I'm asking about Susana Martinez.LEWANDOWSKI:  We absolutely stand by our statement that the states of New Mexico could be doing better and what we need to do is we need to stop illegal immigrants from coming across the border illegally, we're going to build that wall so that American citizens have a chance to have their jobs first and not have taken from someone else outside of the country who doesn't belong here.WALLACE:  Where do things stand with getting House Speaker Paul Ryan to endorse Trump?  And how worried are you and how worried is Trump about the possibility, the continued talk about a third party conservative run perhaps by Mitt Romney?  LEWANDOWSKI:  Well, look, a third party ran by any candidate is a complete disaster and you're handing the White House to the Democrats, which means four or five potential U.S. Supreme Court justices that Hillary Clinton would have a chance to appoint.  If she does that, you can say goodbye to the Second Amendment amongst other things, right?  You can say goodbye to your rights.  And so, the bottom line is that Mitt Romney decides he wants to get in this race, number one, he is failed candidate.  Number two, he's failed twice.  And if he runs a third time, he'll fail again.  But what he will do to the detriment of our country is he will allow a Democrat to appoint four or five Supreme Court justices that are going to be devastating long term to our country.  So, if Mitt wants to do that.  It's failure.Number two --  WALLACE:  And what about Paul Ryan?  LEWANDOWSKI:  Think of all of the people who have come out in the last two weeks and endorsed Donald Trump, U.S. senators, congressmen, governors.  We are growing this party bigger.  We are bringing people into it.  Paul Ryan and Mr. Trump have had a conversation and they continue develop that relationship.  They had a great meeting in Washington, D.C., where they talk about what was important to both of them.  They agree on many issues.  The bottom line is, Donald Trump is now the head of the Republican Party as the Republican nominee.  And what we know is that he brings people together and him and Paul Ryan are going to have a great relationship, because at the end of the day, the choice is binary. You either have Hillary Clinton and the White House, or you have Donald Trump.  Now, I think that we know that the American people, Paul Ryan and Donald Trump are going to work very well together to cut taxes and renegotiate our trade deals.  WALLACE:  All right.  New subject.  You're in charge of the team that is going to vet vice presidential candidates for Donald Trump.  He said almost three weeks ago that he is down to a short list of five or six candidates.  Are you really down to that small a universe?  LEWANDOWSKI:  Well, let me clear. There's one person in this country who's going to pick the next vice president of the United States, as a running mate, and that's going to be Donald Trump.My role and others is to make sure that he has the resources and knowledge to make that decision.  Once he's made that decision, he's very comfortable with it.  We've begun this process.  We start to shrink that pool, and what we are doing right now is making sure that we've done our due diligence, so that when he chooses a person that he wants, we can give him the pros and cons of each of those individuals and he will always make the final decisions.  So, we feel really good where we are in the process.  WALLACE:  But you're not prepared to say at this point you're down to five candidates?  LEWANDOWSKI:  I can say that the list is very small and we have a very good understanding of those handful of individuals will be.  And ultimately, the decision will be made by Mr. Trump.  WALLACE: Meanwhile, your campaign is far behind Clinton's when it comes to campaign infrastructure, state organization, polling, data analytics  And there even seems to be some confusion about which super PAC, outside group, that Trump would like people to contribute money to.  Isn't that a problem?  LEWANDOWSKI:  It's not, because here's what you have.  You have the mindset of Hillary Clinton where you have to have hundreds of -- she's got 800 people on staff.  We got 70 people on staff, right?  They think that bigger is better.  That's the mindset that a Clinton administration will take to the federal government.You know, you juxtapose that with the Trump mindset, which is smaller, leaner, more efficient and better results, that's the mindset you need for the federal government.  So, what you have seen for us, as Mr. Trump dispatched 16 candidates in the primary, you know, we spent less money and had better results on all of them.  Clinton spent over $200 million in this race, and Trump has spent $50 million in the race, we got better results.  What you need is you need people who can be effective and efficient and making sure that we're getting things done.  We don't need to grow this campaign to 700 or 800 people like the Clinton campaign.  It's ridiculous.  WALLACE:  Well, let me --  LEWANDOWSKI:  What you need to do is you need to be efficient.  So, in our state operations, we're very efficient.  And what we've seen success time and time again with a smaller, leaner, more efficient team because that's the way to run the government should he be the president of the United States.  WALLACE:  Let's talk about the team because there are continuing reports about battles inside of the campaign.  You and campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, are said to be at each other's throats.  The national political director was just fired.  There was a story in The New York Times this week that the staffers are worried and suspected that they're being bugged inside of the Trump Tower.  Respectfully, this sounds less like a presidential campaign and more like ""Game of Thrones.""  LEWANDOWSKI:  You know what this is?  This is media hype.  You know, I can tell you this, that Paul and I have a fantastic relationship.  We work together very closely every day, we're making decisions together every day for not just the campaign but for the future of what we want to accomplish here.  It's very important to know, very, very important to know that there's no sunlight between Paul and I.  Every decision is made together.  We talk 10, 12, 15 times a day.  We each have our own respective responsibilities in the campaign and we're moving forward.  You know, the media wants to perpetuate this story that there's infighting amongst the campaign.  The bottom line is, we're winning.  This week, Donald Trump became the Republican nominee by securing more than 1,237 delegates.  It was done two weeks ahead of schedule.  That was done with Paul and I working together to make sure that those unbound delegates came over and supported Mr. Trump.  So, we're weeks ahead of where we thought we were going to be, thinking that we wouldn't have the nomination wrapped up until June 7th.We can only do that as a team.  This team is very cohesive.  It's small, it's lean, it's efficient, and it's going come right at Hillary Clinton for this presidency come November.  WALLACE:  And in 10 seconds, is there any bugging going on at the Trump Tower?  LEWANDOWSKI:  Well, I think that's a lot of speculation.  I don't think that's the case at all.  I think we're happy with how our offices are set up.  WALLACE:  Corey, thank you.  Thanks for sharing part of your holiday weekend with us.  We appreciate it, sir.LEWANDOWSKI:  Thank you.  WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring our Sunday group to discuss how Trump is preparing for the general election now that he has clinched the GOP nomination.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA:  They're rattled by him, and for good reason, because a lot of the proposals that he's made display either ignorance of world affairs or a cavalier attitude.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  President Obama at a summit in Japan relaying the concern of other world leaders about Donald Trump.  And it's time now for the Sunday group: Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume, Susan Page from USA Today, syndicated columnist George Will, and Ron  Fournier of the National Journal, author of the new book, ""Love That Boy"", it is a perfect gift for Father's Day.  RON FOURNIER, NATIONAL JOURNAL:  Thank you very much.  WALLACE:  There you go.  Brit, some people were up upset that the president criticized Trump while he was on a foreign visit, an international summit, bringing up the old axiom, which seems kind of quaint now, that politics stops at the water's edge.  First of all, were you offended by what -- by what Obama had to say?  BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Oh, I wasn't offended.  WALLACE:  Secondly, let me get the questions out.  One, were you offended?  Now that Obama's approval rating is back up over 50 percent for the first time in a long time, how effective do you expect him to be for the Democrats in this election?HUME:  Well, he is going to be effective to the extent that his approval rating remains high.  I mean, there is a very high correlation between an incumbent president's approval rating and the success of his party's nominee in the fall.  So, if that stays up, that's a significant plus in Secretary Clinton's favorite as she runs here.  Whether he will be in -- how effective he will be out on the stump is anybody's guess.  But the approval rating does correlate with winning, and that's obviously a key factor here.As for whether I was offended, no, I was not offended because the customs of politics stops at water edge is long gone.  And besides that, he got a question which he answered and a way that Trump managed easily to turn into a talking point on his own.  So, everybody is saying he wants these foreign leaders to be rattled because they've been getting a free ride of us for too long.  So, that's all good.  That's a negotiators stance.WALLACE:  Trump not only took incoming from the president, he also took it from Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts over his statement in 2006 that if the housing bubble bursts, he'd be able to make some money. Here she is.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, D-MASSACHUSETTS:  And roots for people to get thrown out of their house.  A small, insecure money-grubber who doesn't care who gets hurt so long as he makes the profit of it.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Well, Trump had, Susan, an answer for that.  He said that Warren has a big mouth and he called her Pocahontas, referring to the fact that she once claimed American Indian heritage.SUSAN PAGE, USA TODAY:  Still claims. She's never back off that.  She says that still -- she still believes that to be the case.You know, she figured out how to do something that eluded 16 Republican rivals, which is how to get under Donald Trump's skin.  She's not yet endorsed Hillary Clinton.  She's the only woman senator who hasn't endorsed Hillary Clinton.  But she is doing Hillary Clinton a world of good by engaging with Donald Trump, and making him respond.  I think she has figured out how to irk him.WALLACE:  And irking is good?  PAGE:  Irking is good if you're running against somebody and you want to get them a little bit off their game.  I'm not sure how valuable it is to call her Pocahontas.  It doesn't seem to me that does her a lot of damage.  She doesn't seem to mind that.  WALLACE:  How about big mouth?  PAGE:  Big mouth, you know?  I mean, she is somebody who has demonstrated an ability to throw a punch.  And that's to the good of the Democrats, it seems to me.WALLACE:  George, I want to go slightly a bigger picture than big mouth and Pocahontas, because Trump was asked this week where he sees the GOP in five years, and he said, ""I love that question.""  And he said, ""I see it as a worker's party, of people who have not gotten a raise in 15 years"", I think he said, ""who feel angry and left behind.""Could he possibly be reshaping the Republican Party?  GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST:  I think that's what he's obviously saying (ph).Fifty weeks ago when he began running for president, he had a verbal tick that he subsequently suppressed.  He used to be talking to an arena full of people and said, the Republican say this, or you Republicans says this and that.  That's perfectly natural for someone who's changed his party registration at least five times in the last 20 years or so, when asked recently about his many deviations from conservatism, he sort of shrugged and said, it's called the Republican Party, not the conservative party.  So, it seems very clear he intends to make it not a conservative party, at least his conservatism has been defined.  If he means to make it by a worker's party, the party of those downscale, many non-college educated white voters, he can do that, but that's nowhere a majority.  He may be counting on independents.  A decade ago, 30 percent of Americans said they're independents.  Today, 42 percent do.  But then you get back to his strange idea of addition I guess by subtraction, you talk about Susan Martinez.  He has a problem with woman, Hispanics and Republicans.  So, he attacks a Republican Hispanic woman governor, forgetting the fact that Mitt Romney got 93 percent of self-described Republicans and lost.  WALLACE:  You know, I want to pick up on this, because I was fascinated that Trump did it and even more interested in the fact that you kind of got an aggressive push back today, defense from Corey Lewandowski.  I mean, what do you make of the idea that the I guess now unofficial Republican nominee, the man who's clinched the nomination 1,237 plus votes, is going after Susana Martinez and Nikki Haley and a bunch of other Republicans?  FOURNIER:  These two things are linked, set aside the fact that workers party is the 20th century bearings in the socialist movement.  Nowadays, what it is, what he's talking about is a dog whistle to the white working class angry voters.  And when she is taking on Susana Martinez, when she's taking on a female Hispanic governor, that's part of his play to the grievance vote among white male voters.He is trying to divide us and he's trying to create this new Republican coalition that would be mostly white, would be mostly angry white males, that the math does not add up, as George says, unless he completely reshapes the electorate.  We have to have a completely different kind of electorate come out in November than we've had in the past.  Somehow you have to increase the white vote, but while not increasing the Hispanic and African vote.  I don't know how you do that.  Maybe he's figured a way.HUME:  Contrast between how he handled Paul Ryan's initial reaction, when Ryan said he was not prepared to endorse him, and indeed he isn't yet prepared to endorse him, at first he lashed out.  Remember, he said, you know, I don't support Ryan's agenda.  Then, he apparently thought better of that tactic, and sat down with Ryan and apparently having continuing conversations with him and you can sense Ryan moving in Trump's direction.  That first impulse appeared to be at work in his attack on Susana Martinez.  He attacks her.  But as you just pointed out --WALLACE:  She said she was just too busy to show up at his rally --HUME:  She didn't show up at his rally, so he took that as a slight, as he had what Ryan said, and lashed out at her, which has been his traditional, habitual way of dealing with things.But politics as George has suggested is always and everywhere about addition and not subtraction.  So, I think it's a mistake and I was surprised, as you suggested, the Corey Lewandowski doubled down on it today, because it just doesn't make any sense.  It's so much easier for him to win her over.  FOURNIER:  And you can tell they're living in the fantasy land, when he says things like --  WALLACE:  Well, wait, you said they're living in the fantasy land.  He is the Republican nominee.  FOURNIER:  They are living in the fantasy land.  You had him on your show and you put -- you called him on this.  He said, we're winning the Hispanic vote.  They are living in a fantasy land.  They're not winning the Hispanic vote.In a way that you go after him is exactly the way that Susan suggested, and exactly what Elizabeth Warren was doing.  When you have a playground bully, a bully in the playground, you punch him in the mouth.  And you punched him in the mouth and you punch him in the mouth.Get him back on the heels.  He's obviously very thin-skinned and very small minded man when you say things to him like, I'm too busy to show up.  If he was a bigger man, that wouldn't bother him.  It gets under his skin.  If you call him small like Elizabeth Warren, that touches him in a place that most people --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  I mean, for all of the Trumpism, he is tied in the polls with Hillary Clinton.  I mean, we do have to reflect the reality that it seems to be selling.  PAGE:  Not only is he tied or almost tied in the polls with Hillary Clinton, he has cleared the Republican field and clinched the Republican nomination while she has not.  He did that in May and she won't do that until June.  She still has, you know, a serious challenge in California.  So, you don't want to dismiss Donald Trump but the question is, has he rewritten all the rules?  He rewrote all the rules for the primaries.  Does that mean he's rewritten the rules for general election when it comes to things like having a campaign infrastructure across the country, because she's building one and he is behind on that?  WALLACE:  So, let me just quickly ask you about that and we have to go.  When I asked Corey Lewandowski and he basically said, hey, we've got a tenth of her staff and we're winning, do you buy that?  PAGE:  So, I think, historically, you'd say, no, that's not going to work.  But he's been a different kind of candidate this year, so you don't dismiss it out of hand.  FOURNIER:  You can his candidacy seriously, but not take him as a person seriously.  That's where I am.  WALLACE:  Well, I think we probably should do both.  Anyway, panel, we have to take a break.  We'll see you a little later.Up next, the State Department inspector general issues a highly critical report on Hillary Clinton's use of private e-mail.  We'll ask two key lawmakers whether she broke the law.  Plus, what would you like ask the panel about the I.G. report.  How will it affect the presidential race?  Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  The Democrat candidates jockey for support in California as Bernie Sanders warns the convention could get ugly.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SANDERS:  It's going to be messy, you know?  Democracy is not always nice and quiet and gentle.  But that is where the Democratic Party should be.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  The panel discusses the Democratic divide, coming up on ""Fox News Sunday.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  A lookout side of the beltway at the town of Davis Junction, Illinois, and it's memorial honoring local veterans who made the ultimate sacrifice.  Now to the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal.  A new report by the State Department inspector general says Clinton's use of a private e-mail server while she was secretary of state violated department policies.  Joining me now, two members of the House and the Senate Intelligence Committees.  Here in Washington, Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff.  And in Oklahoma, Republicans Senator James Langford.  So, gentlemen, the way that I want to structure is to show what Clinton said and then what the inspector general's report concluded.And, first, on the issue of whether or not Clinton's exclusive use of private email and personal server was allowed.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  It was allowed under the rules of the State Department. And, again --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So nobody signed off on it?CLINTON: No. No. It was allowed.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: But here's what the report from the inspector general said. ""OIG,"" Office of Inspector General, ""found no evidence that the secretary requested or obtained guidance or approval to conduct official business via a personal e-mail account on her private server.""Senator Lankford?SEN. JAMES LANKFORD, R-OKLA., INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: Yes, that -- that's entirely accurate. She didn't go -- try to get permission. She didn't -- if she would have asked permission, the inspector general said she would not have received that.Since 2002, the State Department has not even allowed employees to be able to forward on from a private e-mail to their official one because they said it wasn't secure. So this is an established issues, has been established a long time for the State Department. You cannot do this.WALLACE:  Congressman Schiff, it actually gets worse when that when two members of the State Department's record keeping division complained about this, expressed concerned, a superior instructed them this way. He ""instructed the staff never to speak of the secretary's personal e-mail again."" That's a quote from the OIG report.Congressman Clinton never got approval.REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALI., RANKING MEMBER, INTELLIGENCE CMTE: No, she was mistaken about that. She thought that it was approved, that the practice was allowed, and she was wrong. The report also makes clear that Secretary Powell also thought it was appropriate to use a personal server, private server --WALLACE:  But that's not -- that's not true. That is not true. And I -- I had a feeling you were going call me on that and that's discuss it right now.SCHIFF: Yes. I am going to call you on that.WALLACE:  Secretary Powell had two computers in his office. He used one, a government computer, for classified information. He had a second computer for private e-mails. Some of those included business, State Department business, but he did have a separate office of the State Department, secretary of the state, computer.SCHIFF: He had a -- a laptop, a State Department laptop, which the OIG report says he never used for e-mail. Not for official business.WALLACE:  That's now what -- that's not what Secretary Powell said.SCHIFF: The -- the -- the -- the -- the OIG report says that he used personal e-mail exclusively for all of his official e-mail business. And the OIG also says that when the -- Secretary Powell was asked to provide --WALLACE:  Did he use -- let me ask another question.SCHIFF: No, no, -- let me -- this -- this is very important.WALLACE:  Well, let me just ask you this, though, did he ever use a private server?SCHIFF: He did use a private server. It wasn't his own private server. It was a server owned presumably by America Online. But he -- yes, he used exclusively a private server. And --WALLACE:  And he had a laptop that goes to the State Department.SCHIFF: But let me -- let me -- let me make one other point, which is -- is I think very critical, which is, the OIG also found that the retention by Secretary Clinton of her e-mails, the fact that she provided 55,000 pages of e-mails, mitigated the fact that she used a private server. In the case of Secretary Powell, there was no mitigation. None of those e-mails were turned over. So the -- the person who was secretary of the state during the decision to go to war in Iraq did not preserve any of his e-mails, one of the most consequential decisions in recent history. That, to me, is far more consequence than the fact that the secretary did preserve them and turn them over.WALLACE:  When -- when did -- when did Secretary Clinton leave the State Department?SCHIFF: I believe it was in 2012 or 2013.WALLACE:  It as January of 2013. Do you know when she turned over the 55,000 pages?SCHIFF: After she left office and she was --WALLACE:  No. No, sir, and you -- and you know it was --SCHIFF: And she was -- and she was requested by the State Department.WALLACE:  Wait a minute, you know it was December of 2014. It was two years later.SCHIFF: Yes. Yes, that's right. That's absolutely right.WALLACE:  OK. Let me just bring in --SCHIFF: But -- but -- but let me ask you this, Chris. I mean --WALLACE:  Well, no, no, no, let me -- I have to --SCHIFF: Yes.WALLACE:  Bring in Senator Lankford.This idea of comparing it to Secretary Powell?LANKFORD: Yes, I've -- I've heard this over and over again. It's -- it is apple and oranges. What Secretary Clinton did was she kept a private serve in her home. This was all about her political security, not about national security. It was about retaining and controlling all these records. And she still has not turned over all these e-mails.And I keep hearing these large numbers. She's turned over $55,000 pages. Well, wonderful. The inspector general's report, when you read it, says that there were e-mails from David Petraeus that they found on the Department of Defense website that were to Hillary Clinton in David Petraeus' official e-mail that she had sent that were never turned over. So we still don't know what it is. She self-filtered all these e-mails --WALLACE:  All right.LANKFORD: And said these are official and these are not and we still don't have those.WALLACE:  All right. I'm -- excuse me for interrupting both of you, but I want to -- to move on to another subject.There's also the security of the information that Clinton kept on her private e-mail server. Here is Clinton.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: There were no security breaches.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  But, the IG report found in January of 2011 a technical support staffer shut down the server twice because, quote, ""someone was trying to hack us."" The next day, a top State Department official told Clinton's staff not to e-mail the secretary anything sensitive. Now, in her defense, Senator Lankford, Clinton says there's no evidence anybody actually got into her server.LANKFORD: Well, that -- that is the defensive that no one got in, but can -- that's something you cannot know. Right now we have about 1,300 plus e-mails and are at some level of classification from what we have and what we know of right now, many of them top secret. That is a major problem. You do not keep that. The issue is, she willfully retained information on a non-secure server that was separate from the government system, that she knew was classified, or that should have known was classified and kept that in a non-secure location. That is a major national security breach that no other cabinet level official did. And all this talk about Colin Powell and everything else, no other cabinet official in the Obama administration did what she did. Everyone else seemed to understand the rules but her.WALLACE:  All right.LANKFORD: But she seems to prioritize her political security over national security.WALLACE:  Congressman Schiff, one, we had never heard about these attempted attacks until the IG's report. So that's new. Two, if the sever was so secure, why did they have to keep turning it off? And, three, as Senator Lankford points out, you don't always know if somebody has a successful attack because hackers don't leave fingerprints.SCHIFF: No, that's true. What we do know from the OIG report is that there were a couple of attempts to hack into the system that were unsuccessful. So we don't know that there's any evidence of a successful breach.But I do want to get back to the point that -- that I want to finish, and that's -- Senator Lankford mentioned, and that is, the comparison with Secretary Powell is --WALLACE:  Oh, come on. Can we -- well, forgive me. Forgive me.SCHIFF: Well, no, you -- you told me you would allow me to -- to push back, and I want to push back.WALLACE:  Wait a minute. No, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.Hillary Clinton is running for president. Colin Powell is not running for president. The rules in 2004 were completely different. They're complete different guidelines. Sir, the guidelines were repeatedly strengthened in 2005, in 2006, in 2007 -- 20011. Hillary Clinton was operating in a different world. Can we please stay to the issue of what Hillary Clinton did or didn't do and not talk about Colin Powell?SCHIFF: Well, I know you don't want to talk about Colin Powell because you -- you don't want to --WALLACE:  It's not -- it's irrelevant to the issue.SCHIFF: It isn't irrelevant in this sense. If you look -- please, let me -- let me finish. The rules --WALLACE:  Did -- how can she say -- how can she say it was secure when they had to turn -- turn off the server because there were attacks?SCHIFF: Chris, the rules --WALLACE:  Just answer my question.SCHIFF: I will. I will answer the question. She should not have used the private server. She's admitted she should not have used a private server.WALLACE:  How did she know it was secure?SCHIFF: Look, we -- we know from the OIG report that there were two attempts to breach the server that were unsuccessful. That's what we know. But -- but please let me at least finish the point.WALLACE:  Not on Powell. I'm -- I'm -- forgive me, I'm going to keep going. I -- I -- I -- we're done with Colin Powell.SCHIFF: I think it's very telling --WALLACE:  We're done with Colin Powell.SCHIFF: OK. I they it's very --WALLACE:  OK, well, then we'll move on.SCHIFF: I think -- I think it's very telling, though, Chris, that there's no interest in anyone here but Secretary Clinton. That, to me, is a very different standard.WALLACE:  Really? Because she's the only one running for president.SCHIFF: Yes, but does that mean that other secretaries didn't use the same practice, that their practices are irrelevant here?WALLACE:  I -- I think, first of all, we've shown that it is -- it is different. And, secondly, I think it's, frankly, a red herring, sir, and I would expect more from you.From the start, Clinton said that she would cooperate with any investigation. Here she is just last month.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: We made clear that I'm happy to answer any questions that anybody might have and I stand by that.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  But here is the inspector general's report. All right, let's talk about Powell and Powell's standard here, congressman. ""OIG interviewed Secretary Kerry and former Secretaries Albright, Powell, and Rice. Through her counsel, Secretary Clinton declined OIG's request for an interview.""Congressman Schiff, what happened to answering anybody's questions at any time?SCHIFF: But now you bring up Secretary Powell.WALLACE:  Oh, come on, I -- did he agree to an -- he agreed to an interview.SCHIFF: Yes -- but -- he agreed to an interview.WALLACE:  Why -- why did he agree to an interview and Secretary Clinton not?SCHIFF: Well, if you let me -- OK. I don't know why Secretary Clinton --WALLACE:  Do you think she should have agreed to an interview?SCHIFF: I think she certainly could have agreed to the interview. She --WALLACE:  Should she have agreed to an interview?SCHIFF: She's -- she's going to meeting with the Department of Justice and if there are any (INAUDIBLE) questions, she can answer them. But let me say this.WALLACE: But why -- why shouldn't she speak to the inspector general of her own department?SCHIFF: But, Chris -- Chris, you brought up Secretary Powell this time. So -- so --WALLACE:  I brought it up in the fact that -- in the fact that he spoke to them and cooperated with the investigation and she did not.SCHIFF: That -- yes, that he (INAUDIBLE). But you didn't -- you didn't -- you did not bring up the fact that when Secretary Powell was asked to provide whatever e-mails he retained or to work with the private provider of those e-mails to provide them, he did not respond and still has not responded to the IG. You did not bring that up. Now --WALLACE:  OK. So, you know what, I'm not going to vote for Colin Powell for president this time.Senator Lankford, your reaction to the fact that Hillary Clinton did not cooperate and did not participate in this investigation.LANKFORD: Not only did she not participate in the investigation, the other staff did not participate. The IT folks did not participate. They barred all folks from participating and blocked them from talking to the inspector general. They had very limited access. In fact, the IT person that actually handled this resigned from the State Department, which made them ineligible for the inspector general to be able to pull in (ph). What the inspector general has identified, even though all the other information is there and Hillary Clinton would not step up and actually speak to the inspector general. The inspector general has noted that clearly Secretary Clinton violated the rules. Now the FBI will step forward and will find out if she's actually violated the law. And that is a big issue. She clearly, willfully retained this, though she would not speak to the inspector general about it. Now it's time for the FBI to settle the criminal part of this.WALLACE:  And -- and -- and very briefly, if I can, senator, since Congressman Schiff seems to think that Colin Powell is so important to this discussion, your reaction to that?LANKFORD: Well, my reaction to that goes back to the same thing. This is a distract type method. It's the same thing the Clinton's always do, they've always done. It's to say it's not just us, everyone else -- there's a conspiracy about this or we're not the only ones that has done it. The ethics of it are extremely important. The law was clear on this, that you have to retain, you have to use government systems, you have to be able to step forward and testify. All those things are clear. They failed to do any of those things. This really was about her political security, not about national security, and I think that's the most telling part about this. No other cabinet official did this.WALLACE:  Gentlemen, I'm -- I'm sorry --LANKFORD: No other cabinet official did this but the secretary.WALLACE:  OK, Senator Lankford, Congressman Schiff, thank you both. Thanks for your time this holiday weekend.SCHIFF: Thank you, Chris.WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring back our Sunday group to discuss the political fallout from the IG report on Clinton's use of a private e-mail server. How badly has she been damaged?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: As I say, crooked Hillary. Crooked Hillary. She's as crooked as they come.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Donald Trump piling on after the State Department IG report found Hillary Clinton violated the rules in using a private e-mail server.And we're back now with the panel.Well, let's take a look at how Clinton's numbers have dropped since the story first broke back in March of 2015 about her private e-mail and personal server. Back then, it's interesting to note, 47 percent had a favorable view of her, 50 percent unfavorable, basically even. Now that's down to 37 percent favorable, 61 percent unfavorable. Same with whether she's honest and trustworthy. In March of 2015, 44 percent said yes, 52 percent said no. Now it's 31 percent to 66. Which raises the question, Brit, does the IG report do any damage to Clinton or has the damage already been done?HUME: Well, the damage has been done, but political campaigns are fluid and people's opinions can shift and change. This, however, I think, helps to cement in place the notion that she cannot be trusted. And it's just one more step in that direction. And, you know, this is an unusual campaign, Chris, in which each of these candidates, Trump and Clinton, seem to be each other's best hope and, you know, the best -- really what's striking about the recent rise in the polls of Donald Trump is that it coincides with a period of bad news for Hillary Clinton and her vulnerabilities become his possibilities and this is just a further example of that. It's remarkable.WALLACE:  We asked you for questions for the panel and we got a bunch about the IG report. GuyGracie Senter, I don't know if that's one person or two, wrote us on FaceBook, ""if she did this when in the State Department, what will she do if she becomes president?"" And John Garnett writes, ""does anyone really think Hillary will be indicted? Will she be prosecuted or will Loretta Lynch,"" the attorney general, ""give her a 'get out of jail free' card?""Susan, how do you answer them?PAGE: Well, I don't think we know what the results of the FBI investigation are going to be. Legal analysts have looked at this, and I think have been skeptical, that she's going to be indicted. But you never know where investigations go.And while the inspector general's report is -- is very critical, I don't think it does new damage to Hillary Clinton. An FBI conclusion that was more serious, I think, could do some real damage to her.You know, it's interesting, she's going to be the first woman nominated by a major party to be president. Women candidates usually have to deal with whether they're strong enough. She's fine on that. Competent, people think she's competent. This honest and trustworthy issue, this is her Achilles heel when it comes to her election. It's an issue she really needs to figure out a way to -- to address, to at least improve those numbers to some degree.WALLACE:  Susan, do you think the -- the Colin Powell defense gets her off the hook?PAGE: No, because, number one, Colin Powell is not running for president. She is. And, number two, I think all of us, of a certain age, understand that use of e-mail has changed -- changed even in the period from when Colin Powell left the State Department.WALLACE:  He left (INAUDIBLE) 12 years ago.PAGE: Yes, and -- and Hillary --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the (INAUDIBLE) policy changed under (INAUDIBLE).PAGE: And then the policy changed. But we know that Hillary became --WALLACE:  (INAUDIBLE) server.PAGE: Yes. So I think there -- number one, there are some -- some differences in the context. And, number two, he's not running for anything.WALLACE:  And, as I said, I'm not going to vote for him for president anyway.Meanwhile, the Democratic primary race continues, even though Clinton has declared victory over Bernie Sanders. Here they both are.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I will be the nominee for my party, Chris. That's -- that is -- that is already done in effect. There is no way that I won't be.SANDERS: Just a ting arrogance there, I think, though.And I kind of thing that on June 7th, people of California will have a message for Secretary Clinton.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  George, how much damage is Bernie Sanders doing to Hillary Clinton? And what -- and it certainly seems possible now from these closing polls, what if he actually beats her in California?WILL: Well, it will be 2008 all over again. Indeed  his persistence in this campaign is an exercise in what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. In 2008, California came late, as it always does, and the elected -- the nomination contest was really over. She persisted in California against Barack Obama, beating by some 400,000 votes, eight points, handily. Didn't make a particle of difference and -- and didn't prevent the party from being united. People say, what is -- is Sanders doing this?First of all, look at him. He's having the time of his life. Huge crowds for a back bencher from Vermont. So that's part of it.Second, people said, well, yes, but he's not being a good Democrat. This is the first time he's ever run for anything as a Democrat. So his attachment to the party might be slight. Third, in 1960, Barry Goldwater, junior senator from Arizona, went to the podium of the Chicago convention and said, let's grow up conservatives. If you want to take back this party, and I think we can, let's go to work. He's the nominee four years later. Now, Sanders isn't going to be the nominee four years later or anytime, but he may have the sense that Barry Goldwater did, that there's a movement out there that needs fuel to transform the party. And he may do it.WALLACE:  Do you think he's hurting her by staying in? I mean I understand your argument that she did this to Obama, so it certainly is right. Do you think it's hurting her for him to stay in the race?WILL: I don't think it's doing lasting damage. I think a month from now people won't remember.WALLACE:  I was going to ask you about that, Ron. How confident are you or how likely do you think it is that Sanders, in the end, gets on the podium and holds hands with -- with Hillary Clinton, holds them up? And -- and more -- much more importantly, what about his millions of supporters?FOURNIER: Well, 80/20, he gets up on stage, she gets a lion's share of the voters -- of his voters. Some might stay home. In the end, it really doesn't matter. What does matter is this authenticity and honesty issue. I mean look what we have today. You have the spokespeople for two of the campaigns come out and lie to you. Corey Lewandowski saying that they're winning among Hispanics. You called him on that. and the spokesperson for Hillary Clinton repeating her misleading statements about the e-mail over and over and over again. And it's why we now have a situation where, among independence, among people who haven't decided who they're going to vote for, the unfavorable -- the unfavorability rating for both Clinton and Trump is minus 74 percentile. So the biggest casualty in this campaign is the truth. Neither one of these candidates are worth trusting. And campaigns aren't just about who's going to win on election day. Campaigns are about how we're going to be led. And no matter when wins this race, we're going to have somebody in the White House who has shown again and again and again they can't be trusted.WALLACE:  What do you think of that, Brit?HUME: I think that's what a lot of voters fell, that -- that the choices -- you know, everybody is always saying and always did going back to -- to 1960s. I remember my parents just saying, you know, Nixon and Kennedy, what terrible choice we have. So this is -- this is a -- this is a quadrennial, parental, if you will. And --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not to this degree.HUME: But this -- to this extent, it's greater than I've ever seen it. I mean I think most people believe that the top two finishes in both parties are -- were unacceptable choices.FOURNIER: Can I trace it back to a conversation here?PAGE: And this --HUME: And at -- and at a time when we badly need a successful presidency and a serious and able leader --FOURNIER: Yes.HUME: We're not likely to get one from either -- in either candidate.PAGE: And --FOURNIER: Shortly after the e-mail scandal broke out, I talked to one of her senior people. Right after I wrote the, Democrats and people close to Clinton were saying, this is all about the e-mail. Hiding the e-mail is all about the blurring of lines with the Clinton Foundation. This senior official sat in her office and told me it really doesn't matter. Trust doesn't matter. Because I was saying, this is going to bring down her trust figures. And even if she wins the election, it's going to make it so she can't lead. And -- and a senior official, a longtime friend of Hillary Clinton's said, trust doesn't matter because Bill Clinton won despite the fact that he wasn't trusted as much as Bob Dole.Well, obviously, that's not the case. Trust does matter. You can't lead if people don't trust you. You might be able to win if you run against Donald Trump, but trust does matter. They were wrong about that then and they're wrong about it now.WALLACE:  Susan?PAGE: Well, you know, it -- just looking at this politically. Here's the question. If --if voters look at these two candidates and find them both unacceptable, do they note turn out? Do you have very low turnout and only people on the (INAUDIBLE) or do they -- or do they --WALLACE:  There's a new poll today that says people are -- are --PAGE: Right, not excited. (INAUDIBLE) --WALLACE:  They're interested but not excited about this choice.PAGE: Right. That's right. Or do they feel so alarmed by the prospect of the other guy that even though they're not enthusiastic about this candidate, they turn out and we have very high turnout. And that's one of the effects. The very first question you ask, the impact of Barack Obama, that's where Barack Obama could have some impact on really ginning up turnout among African-Americans and helping Hillary Clinton among younger voters, which is her -- the demographic group with whom she has the biggest problems.WALLACE:  Although we found -- we had found that Barack Obama can do that for himself. He's not been very good at doing that for anybody else.HUME: Exactly right.PAGE: Yes. Right.WALLACE:  All right, thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week,"" honoring American's fallen with 24 musical notes.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  Soldiers placing flags in front of 230,000 grave markers at Arlington National Cemetery. It's a holiday tradition here that we profile a man who created his own special program to make every day a Memorial Day for our fallen heroes. Once again, he's our ""Power Player of the Week.""(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)TOM DAY, BUGLES ACROSS AMERICA: When you're playing it, it's only 24 notes, but it's so meaningful to that family.WALLACE (voice-over): Tom Day is talking about playing taps at the funerals of military veterans. And he should know. He's the founder and president of an organization called Bugles Across America.WALLACE (on camera): All told, h ow many funerals have you done since you started Bugles Across America?DAY: Two hundred thousand.WALLACE:  Really?DAY: In ten years. Right.WALLACE (voice-over): It started back in 2000, when Congress gave every vet the right to a funeral with military honors, including two uniformed officers to present a flag and play taps. The problem was, the military only had 500 buglers. So they sent someone to play a recorded taps on a boombox or an electronic device inside a bugle. Tom Day, who played in the Marines in the 50s, didn't like it.DAY: I call it stolen dignity that these veterans cannot get live taps when we are out there ready to perform live taps.WALLACE:  So he started his organization, recruiting 400 horn players within a year.DAY: Now we have 6,270 horn players and we're doing 2,200 funerals a month.WALLACE:  It's become quit an operation that Day runs out of his basement near Chicago. Families can go on his website to ask for a bugler. A message is sent to ever horn player within a hundred miles of the funeral. Day gives away bugles and helps with uniforms. While they get support from foundations, he runs a deficit every year.WALLACE (on camera): Well, how do you make up for the shortfall?DAY: I kind of make it up myself.WALLACE:  $15,000 to $20,000 a year.DAY: Probably ten.You finish. You're the last of the 24 notes. You put the horn down. And the flag has been presented. Then the family comes over. The kisses, the handshakes from these families, there is nothing -- no amount of money could ever buy the feeling that I get from the family once I finish the 24 notes.WALLACE:  With soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan plus 1,800 veterans of World War II dying every day, there is a flood of military funerals. Day, who is 69, says he wants to keep ongoing until he dies, then leave his organization in solid shape to carry on.DAY: I want every family to have live taps at that going away presentation of their veteran and it kind of tells the Marines who are guarding the gates in heaven, live taps, we're going to let this veteran right in.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  Since we first ran this story seven years ago, Tom Day's organization has grown to more than 5,000 active members who play at more than 2,300 funerals a month.
