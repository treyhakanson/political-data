1	1	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/10/15/donald-trump-campaign-strategy/	Donald Trump's campaign strategy	"This is a RUSH transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" October 14, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: Continuing now with Donald Trump's quest to become president. Last Saturday in Georgia he said this when asked about his popularity.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Personally, what's the secret of my popularity? Honestly? It's my looks.It's true. I'm very handsome. That's the only thing I can think of right now.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Rejoining us now from his headquarters in New York City Donald Trump. That's from the Joe Namath playbook, is it not?TRUMP: Well, we are just having fun. The question was asked ""why are you doing so well"" and I just thought that would be fun. Every once in a while we can have a little bit of fun.O'REILLY: I loved it. I think that's what separates from you the other people.Now, Ben Carson the latest Fox News poll out yesterday, he is right on your heels. I think it's 24, 23 you are beating him. Would you vote for Ben Carson for president if you weren't in the race? Would you support him?TRUMP: Yes, I would. Yes, I would. Good man. He has been very nice to me -- very respectful and nice. And I have also been very nice to him. We have so far gotten along very well. Every once in a while I want him to say something bad so I can go after him but he has been so nice I can't do that -- very hard.O'REILLY: If it comes down to, after the CNBC debate in a couple of weeks the field is going to winnow. I'm not going to say who I think is going to be in the top five but it will probably five guys and Carly Fiorina. I think she'll make the cut. Then, it will become more back and forth because you have to best your competitors.So what's Ben Carson's weakness?TRUMP: Well, it's the lack of experience. He is experienced in certain things but certainly in terms of negotiating with China and all of these countries that have been ripping are us off for so many years, they are just ripping us so badly you have no idea -- you have no idea even, Bill.And I am the best at that. I deal with them all the time. I have beaten them so many times in terms of private enterprise. Right upstairs we have people, the biggest banks in the world in this building from China. That's what I do. I mean I do that. That's what I do for a living. And I do both --O'REILLY: All right. So it's inexperience --TRUMP: -- and Ben doesn't have that kind of experience.O'REILLY: Ok.TRUMP: And by the way unless you turn things around from a trade standpoint and all of those deals, this country is going to go down, Bill, because we are losing a fortune.O'REILLY: Your unfavorable rating is high -- highest of all the Republican candidates, about 50 percent in some polls. Do you have a plan to bring that down to make people like you more? Do you have a plan?TRUMP: Well, I'm also number one in leadership by far by a factor of two and three if you saw that poll that just came out. And some people don't love me but I get the highest marks in leadership. I get by far the highest marks on the economy. You know, there is some pretty important categories when you go up to New Hampshire.O'REILLY: No, I understand that. But just the people -- are you worried about the people who don't? Are you going to try to persuade them to like you? And if so how are you going to do that?TRUMP: Well, every place I go where I spend time -- New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina -- you saw those polls come out today, they're phenomenal. Not only leading by 20 and 25 points but I do very well in favorability. So where they get to know me, where they come for speeches and we all get to know each other I do very well in favorability.O'REILLY: All right. So it's retail politics is going to be able to do that.TRUMP: I haven't been able to do that nationwide yet but that's happening. I think we will be able to do it. I think leadership is very important. I think the leadership poll is the most important to be honest and on that I'm double digits ahead of everyone else. In fact, two or three times in some cases ahead of everybody else. And I think leadership today is going to be really the most important thing.O'REILLY: Ok. Now you are well aware that some people feel that you are an entertainer and not a serious candidate. ""Saturday Night Live"" has gotten you now signed on to come over to do a show in November. And the Hispanics are real mad now at NBC. They don't want you to host the show. Any reaction to that?TRUMP: No reaction at all. I just -- I think you saw the poll in Nevada where I'm leading with Hispanics. I'm doing very well with Hispanics. I think I will win with Hispanics which will surprise a lot of people. But I think I'm going to end up winning.O'REILLY: What makes you feel that way? What about your message is going to make Hispanic-Americans vote for you?TRUMP: Because I'm bringing back jobs to this country --O'REILLY: Jobs -- ok.TRUMP: I'm taking it away from China and Japan --O'REILLY: Got it.TRUMP: And everybody else. And they know -- plus, I have tens of thousand over the years of Hispanics -- Mexicans, Hispanics working for me. I have thousands of them right now working for me. And believe me, they like me a lot. They are doing great. They are making great salaries. They like me very much.And, you know, the radio host in New York, the Hispanic -- they say they really like Trump.O'REILLY: Muy bien.TRUMP: And I think I'm going to win that vote.O'REILLY: El Trump, muy bien.TRUMP: Yes, right.O'REILLY: ""Saturday Night Live"", what if they start mocking you? You know, they're definitely going to do the hair deal. If I were you I would wear your hat on that show, the whole show so they couldn't get the hair.TRUMP: Well, you know, I actually hosted it 10 years ago and Lorne Michaels called me up the other day. He said I'd love to have you host and I agreed to it because it's an honor. I did ""60 Minutes"" last week -- that was an honor. My stable mate was Vladimir Putin and we did very well.O'REILLY: Yes.TRUMP: That was the highest rating in a long time. I think ""Saturday Night Live"" will be a lot of fun, Bill.O'REILLY: But never forget, the biggest honor in your life is being on THE FACTOR. Can't forget that.TRUMP: That is true. There's no question about it.O'REILLY: All right.TRUMP: Number one. That's true.O'REILLY: Donald Trump -- everyone. Thank you very much as always.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

3	3	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/04/02/coburn-we-have-preexisting-condition-country-right-now-un-affordable-care-act/	Coburn: We have a preexisting condition in this country right now  ... the Un-Affordable Care Act'	"This is a rush transcript from ""On the Record,"" April 1, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: During today's speech, President Obama taking a swipe at Republicans, saying many of the tall tales that have been told about this law have been debunked.Republican Senator Tom Coburn joins us. Nice to see you, sir.SEN. TOM COBURN, R-OKLA.: Nice to see you, Greta.VAN SUSTEREN: I thought that was a swipe at some of you and your colleagues. But you come out with a report called ""Prognosis."" As I understand it, reading the report, is that you predicted some things and now -- a while ago, and now you are trying to see if your predictions were right. One of which is let's talk health care costs. You say you predicted they would go up.COBURN: Yeah. And if you look at the average new insurance policy, it's going to cost 40 percent more than it did last year. That includes higher deductibles and higher costs for a policy that's not like the one you had and not -- you don't like it as well. Doesn't give you the same access that you had. So, we know the costs are going to go up. And we know the average. And a matter of fact -- we had the head of the Cleveland Clinic said three quarters of the people who lost their insurance are actually going to get insurance that they don't want.VAN SUSTEREN: If you listen to President Obama today, it sounded like the greatest thing to happen to America.COBURN: Well, look, that's politics of it. We have preexisting condition in this country right now. It's called the Un-Affordable Care Act. And what we have to do is eventually fix it. The president's 28 times has done fixes to it because the law was so lousy. Most of those are going to get challenged in court. Ultimately, since we don't have standing, we have to have injured parties to bring those cases.But the fact is their motives were good. We needed to fix the health care system but the one thing they forgot is markets allocate scarce resources better than any government program. If you want to make something expensive, have the government run it. And that's exactly what we have done. We have made health care for millions of Americans less affordable with less access.VAN SUSTEREN: You mentioned preexisting conditions, and that's the one I think that probably pulls at most Americans. You made a prediction about preexisting, that patients were preexisting conditions that they will still face care restrictions. And then in your report you say -- you explain that even with this provision in the ObamaCare that there is still going to be restrictions for those people.COBURN: There was two levels of this. Remember, in the intervening period, there was this pool of funds that they shut off very early for people with preexisting conditions. So that's number one. Most of the promises that were made over the last three and a half, 4 years didn't come to fruition for those people with preexisting conditions.Now, with preexisting conditions, you will have access -- which I agree with, I don't disagree with that, as a physician, for sure. But the access you have is limited, one, very expensive, based on age. You know, that's the main requirement. Age and whether or not you are a smoker. And the limited choice of who is going to be your caregiver.So, yeah, I don't think you will find anybody on Capitol Hill that doesn't think we should have not taken care of that and, also, not taken care of a lifetime limits, which the Affordable Care Act did. Most of the bills that run alongside that at the same time did it anyway.VAN SUSTEREN: Let me ask you the one -- the medical device tax. For some reason that really makes me upset because now you have 32 Democrats in the Senate and 42 House Democrats who want to repeal the medical device tax. And the thing that makes me a little bit crazy about that one is that it was in the bill from day one. They never bothered to read the bill. And then suddenly, after the bill was passed and they find out that their constituents are medical device makers, suddenly they want it repealed.COBURN: Here are the facts. 47 percent decrease in investment by medical device companies in this country since --(CROSSTALK) VAN SUSTEREN: I'm not saying that. And I understand your position that it should be repealed. I'm saying like, you know, is why didn't anyone bother to receipt bill in the first place? Now suddenly, these Democrats suddenly think, oh, that's a terrible thing because it's their constituents?COBURN: It's their constituents. And that tells you that it's not about policy, it's about politics. And we should have never had a deal about politics. If you want to move big things in this country and solve big problems, you have got to do it on a bipartisan basis. This bill never had any bipartisan support. That's the reason that it's going to fail. It has failed so far. If you look at numbers and affordability, you have a 5.9 million people in 35 states lose their insurance. They have signed up, quote, ""today, 7.1."" We don't know what portion of that will stick because they have to pay the bill. That's when you have insurance, is when you have actually paid. But, 5.9 million people now, four million of those now have come into the exchanges to get a policy that they can't afford or is less affordable to them, with a group of caregivers that are different than what they have.VAN SUSTEREN: To insure about 3.1?(CROSSTALK) COBURN: No. We have got 4.1. No, that 4.1 are people that will buy it. Two million people have made a choice to say this is not a good deal. I had insurance, I was happy with it, I could afford it. Two million people have now said, I will take the fine because it's better for me to put the same amount of money that I was putting in my insurance policy in the bank to cover me. And if I get sick, then I'll sign up.VAN SUSTEREN: Senator, always nice to see you. ""Prognosis."" And I assume we will get another version before you leave office?COBURN: Probably so.VAN SUSTEREN: Another one.COBURN: Good to see you.VAN SUSTEREN: Nice to see you."	['Hill', 'Obama']	[]

6	6	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/10/08/frank-luntz-counts-down-election-day-2014/	Frank Luntz counts down to Election Day 2014	"This is a rush transcript from ""Hannity,"" October 7, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: We continue our countdown to Election Day to 14 -- we're only 28 days away -- and a look at the races that could shift the balance of power in the U.S. Senate. Now, Democrats are fighting to hold on to their seats in several states, and in an effort to do so are distancing themselves now from President Obama and his disastrous policies. However, we did some investigating, and the truth is the following six candidates voted with Obama almost all the time in 2013 alone. Take a look.In Arkansas, Senator Mark Pryor, he voted with Obama 90 percent of the time. Colorado Senator Mark Udall, 99 percent of the time. North Carolina Senator Kay Hagan, 96 percent of the time. Alaska Senator Mark Begich, 97 percent of the time. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, 97 percent of the time. Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire, well, she voted with the president a whopping 99 percent of the time. So how big a factor will all those number be come November the 4th?  Here to discuss is pollster Frank Luntz. How are you, sir? FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER: I'm fine, thank you. It's interesting that New Hampshire race because it's a place I've been up to where Jeanne Shaheen -- New Hampshire has always been an independent state, a right-of-center state. Shaheen surprised people when she won six years ago. And that 99 percent figure would really upset voters if they knew about it.  That's not independent. That's not what New Hampshire voters thought they were supporting six years ago. HANNITY: Brown is about -- if you look at the Real Clear Politics average, he's down about four points. Are you saying he's still in that race? LUNTZ: He's absolutely in that race. In fact we did some ad testing.  I don't know if you've got it, but he's now used the issue of immigration and Shaheen's support of amnesty against her, and I think that that's had a significant impact over the last three, four weeks as Brown has continued to shrink that lead. HANNITY: How big of an issue is ObamaCare? How big an issue is these percentages, voting with Obama with the president's popularity sinking as it is. How big of an issue is it nationwide? LUNTZ: It's significant. And in the races that you mentioned, in places like Louisiana and Arkansas, I believe that it is the deciding factor in why those seats are likely to shift to the Republicans. In states like Colorado, Iowa and North Carolina, states where Obama won by a narrow margin, he's no longer the asset that he once was. And even in a state like Alaska, which is completely outside the lower 48, as they would say, it is the linkage between Begich and Obama that is at this point likely to cost Begich that seat. So, people are angry with him because he doesn't show up to vote, and they're angry with him that when he does he only votes the Obama position. HANNITY: So if the Republicans as is predicted take Montana, South Dakota, West Virginia, expected, Mark Begich is down five in Alaska, Mark Pryor and Mary Landrieu go down, then you've got Joni Ernst, who is winning by a few points in Iowa. That looks like a good chance for a Republican pickup. You're saying New Hampshire is still in play. Then is Kay Hagan going to hold on? I'm surprised that Kay Hagan is doing as well as she's doing. She's up by about three or four points. LUNTZ: Because her advertising campaign -- and I'd be happy at some point to show your viewers this. Her advertising campaign is remarkable. She's been effective at selling herself as an independent, as being the most moderate senator of them all. And, frankly, the Republican campaign has not been as effective there. HANNITY: She votes with Obama 96 percent of the time. That's not moderate.LUNTZ: It's not moderate, but she was called this by National Journal or Congressional Quarterly or one of these sources -- and so she's been running it and she's been running it effectively. But Sean, your viewers need to follow one other state, which is Kansas. This is the most vulnerable Republican in the country. HANNITY: Pat Roberts. LUNTZ: Kansas has voted -- Pat Roberts -- has voted for John McCain and Mitt Romney overwhelming. It's been a landslide there. Roberts is even losing Republicans. And what I don't know if Kansas understands is that they could actually give Barack Obama his majority in the Senate if they throw Pat Roberts out. HANNITY: Orman is an independent. They asked the Democrat to bow out of the race. He wouldn't even say up until recently who he would caucus with. We all know it would be the Democrats. So, he's a bit of a Democratic plant. He's been avoided taking any tough positions even on the Keystone pipeline. I'm surprised that Roberts is still in that much trouble, but you're right, he's in trouble. Let me run something for you. Some have suggested that Mitch McConnell might be in trouble. He has nearly a five-point lead in the Real Clear Politics average online. Project Veritas and James O'Keefe, they did some undercover work, and basically everybody that surrounds Alison Grimes is saying she's a liar on the issue of coal. This has only broken in the last two days. These are the two videos today and yesterday. Let me ask you if you think this will have an impact. I'll roll this tape. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, PROJECT VERITAS ACTION)PV INVESTIGATOR: I've seen the ads where Alison is up there talking about how she supports the coal industry. I started thinking to myself -- JUANITA RODRIGUEZ, WARREN COUNTY DEMOCRAT OPERATIVE: She has to say that because in Kentucky if you don't support the coal industry you're dead politically. And I know that that's true. And I know that's why she has to say that. But you know what, politics is a game. You do what you have to do to get to point B.  And then you do -- I mean, it's a lying game, unfortunately. ROS HINES, FAYETTE COUNTY DEMOCRATIC OFFICE: So she's saying something positive about coal because she wants to be elected? PV INVESTIGATOR: Right. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And in the state of Kentucky if you are anti-coal, you will not get elected, period, end of conversation. PV INVESTIGATOR: She supports big coal. NIKO ELMALEH: No, she's going to (BEEP) them as soon as she gets elected. PV INVESTIGATOR: Really? ELMALEH: Yeah. Take my word for it. Can I have your card? Take my word for it. She's going to do what he has to do to get elected and then she's going to (BEEP) them. OK, trust me. She's a killer(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: I predict this will have a big impact on that race. True or false?LUNTZ: Let's go further than that. The fact is Mitch McConnell is going to be the next senator from Kentucky. Call it now. If I'm wrong, throw me off your network. McConnell has run a very effective advertising campaign. He's proven that he's important for the people of Kentucky. Now, she's had some good ads, but when they said ""end of story,"" there's one thing I know from Kentucky voters, which is that they absolutely reject dishonesty. When you are so cold and calculating that you will say absolutely anything to get elected, even things that you don't believe in, Kentucky will say to you absolutely, positively no way. She's going to be punished for this, but it's not just her failure. It's McConnell's demonstration -- even though they're anti-incumbent in Kentucky -- his demonstration that he takes care of people, that he solves constituent problems. He's going to get reelected. HANNITY: And she's running this ad now where she's accusing McConnell of taking money from the anti-coal groups. Let me put up the Washington Post. They actually gave the Grimes ad four Pinocchios, which means that's kind of the biggest lie that you can tell. LUNTZ: Everyone knows where McConnell stands. It's part of the positive about him and the negatives, that he's been around for a while.  You can't lie about McConnell's record and get away with it. You can't lie about coal and get away with it. But Sean, there's a bigger issue here, which is that people will now say anything to get themselves into office. HANNITY: That's sad. That's why people hate politicians. All right, give me your last predictions. How many Republican pickups? What's going to be the number in January? LUNTZ: If the election is held today, it's going to be really narrow, but the GOP will end up with 51 seats. I actually think it's more likely that they end up with 50 than 52, but at this point they get the majority.  It's up to Republican voters in Kansas to determine whether Barack Obama will have a Democratic Senate. They need to take that to heart. HANNITY: All right, Frank Luntz, good to see you.Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2014 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
