This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Everyone is buzzing about Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann. Is she running for the presidency or not? Now, we just asked, so you're about to hear her answer.But first we asked about what she thinks about what is going on in Libya.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VAN SUSTEREN: Congresswoman, nice to see you.REP. MICHELE BACHMANN, R-MINN.: Nice to see you, Greta.VAN SUSTEREN: There's so much going on in Libya, and then the massacre today in Syria. If you were making decisions for this nation, what would you recommend and what would you be doing about Libya? And would you be looking to assist in Syria whether it is helping the protesters, what would you do?BACHMANN: Well, I would not have done what the president did in Libya. I would not have intervened now at this time. We don't know hot opposition forces are. We don't know if the opposition is being pushed by Hamas, Hezbollah, or even Al Qaeda in northern Iraq. That could be a far worse outcome than dealing with Qaddafi. Qaddafi is not necessarily been the best friend of the United States, but in some ways he's been neutralized.But the current situation in Libya is a very difficult one. But I would not have gone in with United States soldiers, particularly not without consulting Congress and without making the case to the American people.VAN SUSTEREN: Is it a distraction and unwise and something you wouldn't do or is it something that is dreadfully wrong that alarms you? There are two ways you can look at this, if you oppose it.BACHMANN: I think it is the idea, Greta, again I don't think all of the information was on the table about the situation. Clearly, what we're looking at, we aren't sure who is in charged with allies. The United States went in. Are the allies involved? We were told initially the Arab League was involved, then they weren't.There are so many uncertainties. One of the first phrases that came from the administration was ""Qaddafi must go."" In the same breath it was ""But it is OK if he stays."" There's so much incoherence from the administration now it is difficult to comprehend what their thinking was going forward with this, because we don't know what the endgame will be.With all of the unrest that we are dealing with around the world, whether it's with Iraq and Afghanistan or the recent tragedies that we've seen in Japan and the earthquakes, there's been four earthquakes this last year, financial tension in the United States. I think the people of the United States are on edge now. And I just think they don't want to be engaged in yet within more conflict.VAN SUSTEREN: Now the reason why, I quickly said let's book Congresswoman Michele Bachmann tonight. The political buzz is you were inching closer to making a decision whether or not you will run for president. Last time we spoke you said you hadn't made up your mind. Since we last spoke have you inched closer to making up your mind and making the decision to pull the lever and run for president?BACHMANN: We have inched closer. I think because of that we've been making trips to the various early primary states to talk about the conversation about 2012. I think we moved a step closer at this point, we are looking at the Iowa straw poll in August in order to be part of that we'll have to make a decision about an exploratory committee.And what we're saying is if we do make that decision and we are making serious consideration the decision is not made yet, I want to be clear about that. But if we do make the decision we are looking at the early part of summer.VAN SUSTEREN: When I heard the news I started reading everything, including the ""Des Moines Register,"" I should add you are coming to us tonight from the state of Iowa. You are running around the state today with Senator Kent Sorenstam who is a Tea Party guy, pretty much within the Republican Party. You met with member of the Republican Party in the Senate. It is said you were going to see the governor. I take it you did.BACHMANN: I did.VAN SUSTEREN: It talks about how you are talking to the home school and evangelical element of Iowa which is what Governor Huckabee picked up when he won in 2008. It looks like that is your strategy. Am I on or off the mark?BACHMANN: My strategy is to talk to all people in the early states not just one segment. I'm delighted to talk to all the people I've spoken with this time. When I was here on my last trip I think you sent Griff [Jenkins] along on that trip. I had given a speech for tax relief I focused on all of the fiscal issues during that time.I'm continuing to talk about the fiscal issues on this trip as well. This is uppermost in people's minds no matter if they are self-identified as social or fiscal conservatives. Everyone is concerned about the anemic job creation in the United States. Everyone is worried about the out of control spending.And what I'm hearing from people in Iowa is they want us to repeal and defund ""Obamacare."" That's a very strong message that I'm hearing. That's my commitment now as a member of Congress. I think that has to be done by our next president of the United States. We need a full and complete commitment that Obamacare will not only be rolled back it will be repealed and defunded so we can get back to free market health care and health care that will reduce the cost and provide better care for people.(END VIDEOTAPE) VAN SUSTEREN: We have more of our interview with Congresswoman Bachmann straight ahead.But coming up, she made a mistake and hammered for it. Congresswoman Michele Bachmann even owned up it to. But apparently that wasn't enough for some. Is there more to this story? The congresswoman will tell you herself.Plus, Donald Trump teaming up with President Obama, really? Is Rush Limbaugh pushing that? You'll hear straight from Rush ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWS BREAK)VAN SUSTEREN: Are conservative women being targeted? I guess it depends on who you ask. Minnesota Congresswoman Bachmann says there is a double standard. She recently apologized for making a big gaffe. She made a mistake about the start of the Revolutionary War and was slammed by the media. But would a man face the same ridicule? We asked Congresswoman Michele Bachmann.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)VAN SUSTEREN: As I said, I've been tracking you all day. It seems it was focusing on -- obviously your trip this time, the evangelicals and home-schoolers are organized when it comes to caucus it seemed like a smart strategy to go there.But four years ago when Governor Huckabee won there was no Tea Party movement, and there is. Do you run the risk that you are a spoiler like a Ross Perot if you get a huge hunk of Tea Party people like Ross Perot was to President Bush 41, or am I jumping way ahead of myself?BACHMANN: Remember the Tea Party is a coalition of America. It is made up of Democrats and independents and people who aren't political, libertarians, conservatives, and Republicans. It is a very broad swath of America.And these are Americans who want the country to work again. They are very practical people. When I grew up here in Iowa, I'm a seventh generation Iowan. When I grew up in my family was Democrat, reasonable fair-minded people. We had Republicans and Democrats in our family. We weren't terribly partisan. We just wanted the country to work and have good jobs and fair taxes. That's what a lot of America wants. That's what the Tea Party wants.So this isn't some sideline group. This is a broad swath of America. I'm talking to people from many different groups. I will be talking to pastors, to home-schoolers. I spoke to the governor. I spoke to the Senate today. I met with members of the Iowa House yesterday. I also met with leadership of various organizations across Iowa.I'm trying to talk to as many people as I can from as many constituencies as I can as well as agriculture groups. Ag, of course, is the industry in Iowa. I spoke to a number of people as well. I'll be trying to talk to as many as I can, because the election is about all Americans and having the country work again.VAN SUSTEREN: I travel a lot. A lot of things are said inside the beltway. When you go to these states it's sometimes very different. When we went up to Alaska and predicted Senator Lisa Murkowski would win. We I go to the Iowa papers I see -- Senate Majority Leader Paul McKinley said she is a dynamo and he says you are knowledgeable. You are making an impact there.But what makes you different, for instance, from a Governor Sarah Palin going through Iowa or Senator Santorum. What makes you different?BACHMANN: I love both of them. I know both of them. And I will have them both. They are great people. I think we'll have a very good, broad bench of candidates we put forward.What I bring to the table is the fact that I'm a fighter. I'm authentic. I'm the same person when I campaigned as I am when I'm elected to public office. I was that way when I served in the Minnesota Senate. I've been that way in the House of Representatives. And I'm willing to fight and fight hard no matter what the opposition is for what the people of my district have sent me to do.I've been willing to do that at the national arena. I think that's what people are looking for now in 2012. They want a candidate who is actually willing to take on, even if it is uncomfortable, the interests that are in Washington, D.C., even if it means taking on their own party. That is something I've been willing to do.We have to do that if we want to see the spending change and also if we want to change the arch of history and pull back the government takeover of private industry. It can be done. I want people to know it is very possible that we could win the triple-crown in 2012 by winning the U.S. Senate, holding on to the House, winning the White House and actually having some real change in this country. That's what people are hoping for.VAN SUSTEREN: Let me ask you about your gaffe in New Hampshire. And you struck back when the media went after you, or at least you said President Obama got a pass when he said there are 57 states in the union. And you said there's a difference in the way conservative women are and the men. I think it is women versus men and not necessarily a party affiliation.But why is there that difference if there is between conservative women treatment by the media and men?BACHMANN: I can't account for that. It would be the media makes the decision on how they treat people. I made a mistake. I was happy to admit my mistake and move on, happy to do that. That's old news now. I'm just looking forward to what we have going forward.VAN SUSTEREN: Last time we had Governor Palin on she was the subject of vulgarity by Bill Maher. She didn't want to talk about it either. It is important dialogue how we cover politicians so we ask hard questions so that we also treat you fairly, all of you. Do you have any thought on whether women and men are treated the same.BACHMANN: I really don't. I've never seen myself as different from a man in terms of professionally speaking. I grew up in a home where I had three brothers and no sisters. My parents treated us as equals. They thought us we could do and be anything we wanted to be.So when I into my career and became an attorney and then a tax attorney and my husband and I started our business and I went into politics, I never saw myself as handicapped because I was a woman. I just believed I should rise based upon my own efforts and merit.That's really the American dream, that all of us try and succeed. We try and fail based on who we are and our abilities and talents. That is what America should be about, not necessarily what our gender is.(END VIDEOTAPE)"

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.PAUL GIGOT, FOX HOST: This week on the ""Journal Editorial Report,"" fresh from his health care victory, the president plans a spring offensive from cap-and-trade to immigration reform. The priorities he'll push in the months ahead.This as the battle over Obamacare continues. More than a dozen states signed on to a lawsuit against the federal government. Could this new law be unconstitutional?And as the first Race to the Top winners are announced, a closer look at how two just states qualified for $600 million in cash. Did union politics seal the deal?Welcome to the ""Journal Editorial Report."" I'm Paul Gigot.Fresh from his health care victory, President Obama is a planning major spring offensive, hoping to capitalize on what Democrats see as regained momentum and the White House plans to push through as many domestic priorities as possible during the midterm election. Some of the things on his to-do list, financial, campaign finance and maybe immigration reform passing cap-and-trade legislation and closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.Here with a look what to expect from now until November, Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman; editorial board member, Jason Riley; and Washington columnist, Kim Strassel.Kim, before we get into some of the specific issue areas, I want to ask you a broader political question. Nancy Pelosi, after health care passed, said this is now the model that Democrats plan to use to pass these other priorities. Is this really what they're going to do, try to pass these bills on party line partisan votes?KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMN: Well, they really don't have any choice if you look at that list that you just put out there. Think about it. Most of these things were actually supposed to be on the agenda and supposed to be passed last year, and one of the reasons they didn't do it not just that they were pre preoccupied with health care, but there has not been a lot of enthusiasm for a lot of these different policy priorities. So there are going to have to -- yes -- look at votes like, for instance, cap-and-trade in the House last year, passed on the bare minimum. The legislative reform -- financial reform bill, again, passed on party-line partisan vote. This is what they're going to be doing. A lot of the stuff has to go through the Senate.GIGOT: Right.STRASSEL: There's not going to be bipartisanship around here.GIGOT: Financial reform, James, let's take that first because two Republican Senators, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, said they thought this would pass, a hundred percent certainty this will pass. Are they right?JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: They're wrong.(LAUGHTER)It is nowhere near 100 percent. Those are two senators who are still not backing it. The reason they're not backing it is --GIGOT: Corker said this week he can't support the current bill.FREEMAN: Right, because it has no political force. What the administration wants to do is cast this as their bill versus Wall Street.GIGOT: Right, taking on big banks.FREEMAN: They can't help themselves. They keep wanting this authority to bail out Wall Street. It's in the Dodd bill and they keep pressing for it to be in there. As long as that's in there, it's not going to have any political force because, bulletin to the White House, Wall Street likes bailouts.GIGOT: But Democrats are selling this as a populist action against Wall Street.FREEMAN: Isn't it amazing?GIGOT: They think -- but they can pin Republicans and say, you're defending the big banks because you don't want to raise taxes on the big banks. You still want to help them. They are making record profits. Of course, it's the policy of the current administration that are helping them make those profits, but--FREEMAN: They're not going to get anywhere from that argument. And the reason that people like Corker have not jumped on board is because this is a bailout bill for Wall Street and it's not going to have the political force that they want unless they're willing to step back and say, OK, we're going to cut back the powers in the fed and the FDIC.GIGOT: And allow this to be essentially bankruptcy, to allow companies--FREEMAN: The Republicans are saying give us something like bankruptcy. That's the politically strong message. That's what the American people want. I don't see how that's a -- they're going to be pressured to come over and say, OK, we'll forget bankruptcy and go for bailouts.GIGOT: So this is dicier than the conventional wisdom suggests.All right, Jason, let's talk about immigration reform. The president promised when health care passed, some of his Democratic members, he would make a push on immigration reform. Is that going to happen? Is that going to be serious?JASON RILEY, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: One thing to keep in mind is when President Bush tried to do that unemployment was around five percent. Today it's nearly double that.GIGOT: That worked well for President Bush, didn't it?(LAUGHTER)RILEY: And it's going to be tough with the job situation to push immigration reform. Secondly, it's an election year. This is a very controversial issue, and not something members are going to want to talk about in their districts, I don't think. And the other thing that the administration miscalculated here is that Obamacare is not conducive to more open immigration. Expanding the welfare state is not conclusive to letting lots of more, more low income people into the country, the way the Obama administration wants to push it, immigration reform.GIGOT: OK, so also not likely.Kim, let me go to you on cap-and-trade and energy legislation, because this week, the White House unveiled new oil drilling possibilities off shore, modest as they were. Nonetheless, some people think that was intended to help bring some Republicans along on their larger cap-and-tax agenda. Is that going to work to bring Republicans?STRASSEL: Well, not just Republicans, but Democrats. The thing to bear in mind on energy legislation is it's often about geographical lines as partisan ones. The problem the president has right now with the economy doing as poorly as it is this kind of very expensive cap-and-trade, cap-and-tax sort of policies are going to be really hard in particular on manufacturing states, the Midwest, people that use a lot of coal, coal areas. And this is not sitting well with a lot of Democrats. And this is why this legislation hasn't passed. So, yes, what he did was he came out and is offering some drilling concessions and he wants to offer some nuclear concessions and all designed to not just get Republican support from people like South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, but get some of his Democrats on board.GIGOT: Right. But Kim, all this has to do is pass the Senate. As you said earlier, this has passed the House. If they get it through the Senate, and only need two or three Republicans to come along, wouldn't this give them the ability to push this across the finish line?STRASSEL: It's true, but it's a little more complicated. It's sort of like health care. What they passed in the House was this massive, giant bill full of carve-outs and complicated things that do not include any of the president's concessions on drilling or nuclear loan guarantees, for instance. So you would have to convince the House to come on board and put a bill together that both chambers could agree to. That could take a lot of time and could be as fractious as health care.GIGOT: They don't want to vote for a tax increase. That's the other big --STRASSEL: Right before election, yes.GIGOT: Before election.Let's talk about national security, Dan, and Guantanamo closing. Lindsey Graham, the senator from South Carolina, has been talking to the White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, about a deal he would help them get the money to close-- Graham would, close -- Graham would -- close Guantanamo if the administration would let Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and others terrorists be tried not in New York in civilian trials, but in military commissions. Is that going anywhere?DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: I don't think it's going anywhere much, Paul. Guantanamo, like some of these other issues -- remember how we used to talk about Social Security as the third rail of politics, a toxic issue no one would touch. Virtually all of these issues are third rails because of the glare and publicity they get from the media these days. We went through health care and ended up with reconciliation, the most arcane process in the Congress. And 75 percent of Americans can talk in depth about reconciliation, right?(LAUGHTER)GIGOT: That's an unfortunate turn for the country, I have to say.(LAUGHTER)GIGOT: -- to do what we have to do for a living. Poor AmericaSTRASSEL: Poor America.HENNINGER: I don't think Gitmo has a problem like that. They may, on another national security issue, be able to pass this treaty that the president just signed with the Russians, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, START. I think that the Republicans do not want to be on the wrong side of a national security issue. And I must say, a lot of these Republicans who did not vote, they're in drug withdrawal. They've got to vote for something, these guys have to, and they're going to find a way to do it.GIGOT: I have a hypothesis, Jason. The administration knows it's not going to get most of it. What it wants to do after health care is to try to say to base voters, look, we've got these other agenda items. If you don't come out and vote, these things are not going to happen in our first turn. They're trying to gin up the base and enthusiasm to avoid what happened in Virginia, New Jersey and Massachusetts.RILEY: They could be thinking that way, but I think the Republicans are saying, hold tight we're going to do well in November and we'll come back with more numbers next year to fight these battles. Why should we fight them now?GIGOT: But if they oppose these things, some may fear we may not get as many gains as we want. That's the debate the Republicans are going to be having.OK, when we come back, the legal challenges to Obamacare. Fifteen states are suing, saying the new law is unconstitutional. Do they have a case?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT: Well, Obamacare may have passed, but the battle is far from over. Led by Bill McCollum of Florida, attorneys general for more than a dozen states have filed suit in federal court, challenging the constitutionality of the federal overhaul.Attorney David Rivkin has signed on as outside counsel to several states that are party to the lawsuit. He joins me now.David, welcome.DAVID RIVKIN, ATTORNEY, OUTSIDE COUNSEL TO SEVERAL STATES: Good to be with you, Paul.GIGOT: The bill mandates, health care bill mandates that all individuals in America will ultimately have to buy a government-sanctioned insurance policy, the states say this is unconstitutional. What's their argument?RIVKIN: The argument is that this kind of a mandate that's not tied to any economic activity, but imposed on people merely because they exist, exceeds the reach of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. A broader proposition is it would violate a key element of our constitutional architecture, namely that the federal government is the government of limited enumerated powers, that states retain substantial authority, and that the dual sovereignty system a key way of protecting individual liberty.GIGOT: OK, so it infringes fundamentally on state powers. Is that one of the reasons -- a lot of people would say, the states mandate car insurance, you have -- individuals have to buy car insurance if you want to drive. How is this mandate different?RIVKIN: The difference is precisely that states have general legislative powers, what is often referred to as police powers. As James Madison said on the federalist papers the powers of the federal government under the constitutions are few and finite. The powers of state governments are numerous and infinite. The fact is that the state government can do that, whatever its policy merits, have nothing to do with the federal government's constitutionality it do it. Second -- it's funny. People often mention the driving as examples. There's no constitutional right to drive. And the state imposes this on you as a pre-condition to --GIGOT: If you want to drive.RIVKIN: If you want to drive. Only if you use public roads. If you have your own ranch and you want to drive there, you don't need a driver's license, and you don't need insurance.GIGOT: Has there ever been a case, an example previously of the federal government mandating, forcing individuals -- to say you must buy this product. Can you recall that?RIVKIN: Never, it's never happened in the 200-plus years of our republic. This underscores how indeed revolutionary, unprecedented this is. The problem here, again, we're not talking about a pedantic constitutional principle important to law professors.(LAUGHTER)If the federal government can mandate the purchasing of health insurance, merely because doing so would be to advantageous to this broad regulatory scheme, Paul, there's nothing they cannot mandate. They can, in effect, conscript you to use your hard earned dollars to purchase a variety of goods, services and commodities.GIGOT: But here is an argument a lot of supporters make, that is, this is structured -- this mandate is structured as a tax. You pay a penalty if you don't buy insurance. And a tax under the Constitution is surely legal and constitutional. Ever since the 16th Amendment passed, we can have income taxes. So what's wrong with this?RIVKIN: The short answer is, first of all, the mandate is separate from the tax. So the taxing mechanism does not redeem the constitutionality of a mandate, point number one. Point number two, this is not a true income tax. We would argue that this is a direct tax imposed by the federal government that's really in the nature of a surcharge and not a true income tax. And you mentioned the 16th Amendment. 16th Amendment only allows the federal government to impose taxes on income for whatever source is derived. A very important point. The limitations on the federal government's taxing authority are on the same basis or derived from the same basis as limitations in the Commerce Clause because you don't want to have a federal government with too large of the power. And again, to underscore, it's not just protecting state's sovereignty. It's protecting individual liberty because you want to diffuse power. You want to make sure that no governmental institution wields too much power.GIGOT: Right.RIVKIN: Know what? Progressives and liberals should love the principle. We hear it all the time in the War on Terror cases.GIGOT: I suppose that's right. The other argument we often hear is the argument about the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, which gives Congress the power to pass something and says that the states cannot nullify that legislation. Why is -- again, is this example different than many other cases that the Supreme Court has decided in favor of Congress?RIVKIN: The answer is very simple. The Supremacy Clause indeed allows federal legislation to trump both state legislation and even state constitution, provided -- provided that the federal government is acting constitutionally. So unconstitutional federal legislation does not trump anything at the state level.GIGOT: So this will come down to a question of whether or not, in the mind of the justices, this is constitutional. I want to ask you one more question about the politics of this. The justices care about the law, of course, but they also care about their reputations. Do you really think five justices of the Supreme Court are going to vet to overrule a legislation that is so far reaching, so long-debated? Won't they fear a political backlash?RIVKIN: I do. I do, for a couple of reasons. Call me naive, but first of all, this is so vital to our constitutional architecture. If this law is upheld it would fundamentally reshape the relationship between individuals and the government, between states and the federal government in ways that are unprecedented in 200-plus years. That's my idealistic side.(LAUGHTER)My pragmatic side says, if you look at relevant case law, Justice Kennedy, who will be the leading justice, the swing vote here, in several cases, including the famous case in '95 called Lopez --GIGOT: Right.RIVKIN: -- wrote eloquently about the importance of preserving the dual sovereignty system and how an overly broad Commerce Clause would actually swamp it.GIGOT: All right.RIVKIN: He wrote a beautiful opinion. That's good.GIGOT: All right, we're going to be watching this closely.David Rivkin, thank you.When we come back, Delaware and Tennessee Race to the Top, taking home a combined $600 millions in first round of the Obama administration's education reform competition. Why those two states? Did union politics play a role? We'll investigate next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT: Education Secretary Arne Duncan announced the first round of winners on the Race to the Top this week. That's the $4 billion dollar competition that the Obama administration set up to reward states with the most ambitious plans for improving their public schools. Forty states and the District of Columbia applied for the grants and, in somewhat of a surprise, just two were chosen. Delaware and Tennessee the big winners taking home a combined $600 million. The big question is why they won.Jason, you've been following this closely. Are Delaware and Tennessee the most deserving?(LAUGHTER)RILEY: Well, to hear the administration tell it, Delaware and Tennessee are planning to put in place these data systems that will allow teachers to be evaluated based on student achievement. And the administration said we like that. And they are going to work on turning around bad schools in rural areas and across their states. And the administration said they liked that, too. The problem is that --GIGOT: Do you think that that is useful -- those are useful moves? Is that right, just on the substance?RILEY: Yes. Sure, sure, less on the turn-around efforts of bad schools. I'd rather see those schools closed and replaced. But yes, on using student data to evaluate teachers, yes, absolutely. We should use more of that. I'm glad to see the administration is encouraging that. The problem is that lots of the finalists had those two aspects of their applications up to snuff. The difference -- and the administration was quite upfront about this. If you listened to Arne Duncan talk to reporters after his announcement, he said what they like about Delaware and Tennessee is that they got the union buy-in. The establishment -- the public education establishment was behind the applications of these two states, and that's what a lot of the finalists didn't have. States like Florida and Louisiana did not have the union support of their applications like Tennessee and Delaware had. And I would argue that that should be a knock on Tennessee and Delaware.(LAUGHTER)GIGOT: So states in this competition were punished if they promoted reforms that were so aggressive, so forward leaning, and therefore, the unions opposed them. This hurt the state's applications.RILEY: If you want bold reforms, you must allow states to cross the unions. Because the unions are the ones preventing bold reforms.GIGOT: What are the examples from Florida and Louisiana and let's throw in the District of Columbia here, because Michelle Rhee, the superintendent, has been in a pitched battle with the teachers in her state, in her district, over teacher tenure.RILEY: All three of those states are trying to change collective bargaining agreements, these contracts that control how public school systems --GIGOT: To allow what?RILEY: Well, to allow merit pay and teachers to be paid based on how the students are doing.GIGOT: To be able to fire teachers who are bad.RILEY: To be able to fire teacher who are bad. To be able to not give teachers jobs for life after only two years in the classroom. Things like that. The other thing the administration made a big deal about early on were charter schools.GIGOT: Right.RILEY: Delaware and Tennessee --GIGOT: To its credit.RILEY: To its credit. But Delaware and Tennessee have two of the weakest charter laws on the books, among states and among the finalists in a Race to the Top.GIGOT: What's the lesson here for the other states? You better get buy-in from the union if you want to win?(LAUGHTER)RILEY: Exactly. Unfortunately that's it. Bring the unions on board. It will help you win federal money.GIGOT: And the National Education Association, the --RILEY: Rah-rah.(LAUGHTER)GIGOT: The preeminent union, and their reaction was what?RILEY: We're in control. They issued a press release the day after the finalists of the final two were chosen, saying, you heard it from the federal government. You guys have to deal with us if you want federal money going forward. And there is a second round coming up in September, and I'm sure states will keep that in mind.GIGOT: Dan?HENNINGER: The sad truth is it's all about the money. There's $4.5 billion dollars involved here. And as the governor of Illinois said, we've got to get on the Race to the Top thing to get as much money as we can out of Washington. That's the sad bottom line.GIGOT: And reform is secondary if you can get the -- if you can game the rules enough to get through?HENNINGER: Yes, and usually they can game the rules.GIGOT: All right, Dan.We have to take one more break. When we come back, our ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT: Time now for our ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.Dan, first to you.HENNINGER: On Tuesday, President Obama signed the legislation allowing the Department of Education to take over the student loan programs. And on Tuesday, when students went into the department's Web site, they got an error message because the Web site was down, suggesting that the government is too big to work.Now, you've got to worry. If the Chinese can hack into the Pentagon's most secret weapons programs, how hard is it going to be for an MIT freshman to hack into the Department of Education loan program?(LAUGHTER)GIGOT: They may have to do that.Jason?(LAUGHTER)RILEY: This is a hit to the scientists in Switzerland, who recreated the big bang by getting the sub-atomic particles to collide. It took 16 years and the machine cost $10 billion. But they got it done and now more mysteries of the universe could be solved.GIGOT: Good use of taxpayer money?(LAUGHTER)RILEY: I think so.GIGOT: All right.James?FREEMAN: This is a big hit to the world's investors for giving us the honest accounting of Obamacare that we never got from the Congressional Budget Office. Paul, I'm not bashing CBO. As you know, the rules say they have to do bogus accounting.GIGOT: Congressional Budget Office, yes.FREEMAN: But the ten-year swap spread, which is jargon, went negative this week, or last week, after the passage of Obamacare. What that means is investors around the world thought that American companies were a better credit risk than the U.S. Treasury. So this is a strong signal from the market saying stop spending.GIGOT: It's come back a little bit now.FREEMAN: It's bounced back. There's less corporate debt issuance this week. This is a tough call. The U.S. Treasury has the ability to print money unlike Coca-Cola.GIGOT: Alas, it does. The fed does.And remember, if you have your own ""Hit or Miss,"" please send it to jer@FOXnews.com.That's it for this week's edition of the ""Journal Editorial Report."" Thanks to my panel and to all of you for watching.I'm Paul Gigot. We hope to see you right here next week.Content and Programming Copyright 2010 Fox News Network, Inc. Copyright 2010 Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Right now, Senator Rick Santorum joins us. Good evening, Senator. Welcome to -- welcome -- how's Michigan, by the way?RICK SANTORUM, GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Good evening, Greta. Oh, it's been great. We about had 1,300, 1,400 people here in Oakland County. A week ago, before they announced I was going to be here, they had 300. So we're feeling pretty that we had a lot of folks show up to see us here tonight.VAN SUSTEREN: All right, let me ask you about -- I don't know if you've seen this. First of all, is Foster Friess one of your big supporters and a big contributor to a Super-PAC that supports you? Is he one of them?SANTORUM: He is.VAN SUSTEREN: OK. Now, I'm going to play a video for you today that's making the rounds. And I want to know your reaction to this one. We're going to play the video.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FOSTER FRIESS, RICK SANTORUM SUPPORTER: And this contraceptive thing, my gosh, it's so -- it's such inexpensive. You know, back in my days, they used Bayer aspirin for contraceptions. The gals put it between their knees, and it wasn't that costly.(END VIDEO CLIP)VAN SUSTEREN: All right, now, I know you certainly didn't say that, but -- OK, you shake your head. It certainly is...SANTORUM: Yes.VAN SUSTEREN: ... you know, is -- are, you want to say something about it?SANTORUM: Well, I mean, it's -- look, I'm not going to be responsible for everybody who's -- you know, anybody -- any supporter of mine and what they say. I mean, that's -- that's -- that's -- I'm not going to play that game.I mean, the bottom line is my position is very clear. I've had a -- a consistent record on this of supporting women's right to have contraception. I've supported funding for it.So -- I mean, this is a -- this is a -- in my opinion, this is an attack on someone's religious beliefs because I have a very strong belief, as does my family, in agreement with the Catholic church, somehow or another, that that's -- that's a -- that's something that people should be afraid of, shouldn't be afraid of it.If you look at my record in the public, I've been clear about -- about that issue. I've had a consistent and long voting record on it. And I think this is the media trying to play -- you know, trying to play gotcha. It's -- it's absurd.VAN SUSTEREN: All right, well, let me -- let me understand. All right there -- let me just sort it out. There are two issues. One is the creepy supporter, you know, the guy who says something really creepy about you and who's -- is a -- who's a huge fund-raiser for your campaign. Will you at least, you know, correct him about -- I mean, I think most women don't think it's particular funny, his comment.SANTORUM: Yes. No, look, I mean, Foster is known in political circles as telling a lot of jokes, and some of them are not particularly funny, which this one was not. He's not creepy. He's a good man. He's a great philanthropist. He's a very successful businessman.You know, he told a -- he told a bad, off-color joke, and he shouldn't have done it. But that's -- you know, that's -- that's his business. It certainly doesn't, in my opinion, reflect on the campaign or me because he wasn't doing it as part of our campaign.VAN SUSTEREN: OK. I -- I was -- I shouldn't have said he's creepy. What he said was creepy. I don't know the guy, so I will give it to -- so that I'm -- I'm, you know, clear on that. All right, now let me go to...SANTORUM: He's a very good man. Yes.VAN SUSTEREN: Whatever. I don't know. The only thing I know is what he said. And right now, he's, you know, 0-and-1 with me. All right...SANTORUM: It was a stupid -- it was a stupid joke.VAN SUSTEREN: OK. Stupid joke. All right, now let me go to the issue of birth control. And so that I understand because I've seen a lot of sound bites, little, you know, quotes here and there. I want to understand, you know, do you think that birth control is -- let me pull out a sound bite -- is harmful to women and harmful to society?SANTORUM: What I was talking about, generally speaking, in that interview, was that the idea -- the whole concept of sexual liberation, sexual freedom has had its down sides, and certainly birth control is part of that with a dramatic increase in sexually transmitted diseases, dramatic increase in out of wedlock births, a dramatic increase in the number of abortions.I mean, you know, this has -- this has not just been -- you know, not been just, Well, everything's just fine. And I -- I -- that's a -- that's a commentary that I -- again, is not something that is completely out of the mainstream. The bottom line is there are consequences to the sexual revolution that we are living with in America today.VAN SUSTEREN: In terms of your views on contraception and your religious beliefs -- and everyone comes to the office of the president with certain religious beliefs -- is it something that would in any way -- you know, be -- would it -- I mean, is there any way it would be imposed on the American people? Or is it something that's -- you know, how would we see it in policy, if at all?SANTORUM: Well, good. I -- you know, just look at my record. I mean, I have been criticized by -- by -- I think it was Governor Romney or maybe it was Congressman Paul's campaign for voting for contraception, that I voted for funding for it, which is -- I think it's -- I think it's Title 10, which is -- which I have voted for in the past, that provides for free contraception through organizations, even like Planned Parenthood.And so, you know, it's funny that on the conservative side, I'm getting ripped for having voted for this. And now all of a sudden, the left is trying to make me out that somehow I -- you know, I want to stop women, or men for that matter, from getting -- you know, doing things and taking things for contraception.That -- look, I have my own views on these things. They're deeply held beliefs. But not everything that I think is -- that I disagree with morally should the government be involved in. Only when there is -- there are -- there are real consequences to society or to the -- or to the rights of individuals do I -- do I feel a need to speak out. And that's why I do on the issue of abortion because we have another -- we have another person involved in the decision.But the issue of contraception, that's not the case. It's something that people have a right to do in this country. And it certainly will be safe to do so under the Santorum presidency.VAN SUSTEREN: OK. Now to Michigan. You're in a state -- and it's -- I mean, it must be exciting for you tonight because the polls have you, you know, a little bit ahead of Governor Romney. It's his home state. Both of you come to that state, though, having been opposed to the bailout of the auto industry. And that is the auto industry state. How do you convince those voters to vote for you?SANTORUM: Well, I think I'm different than Governor Romney on that front. I mean, Governor Romney supported the Wall Street bailout. I mean, it was OK to go in and have the government take a huge role in bailing out big financial institutions, but it wasn't OK for them to come and bail big -- the big manufacturers in this country, which are the hub of the manufacturing industry.I would just make the argument that my position is consistent. My position says that you're not -- I'm not for the government getting involved in bail-outs, period. And that to me is something that the folks in Detroit say, Well, look, here's a man of principle. Here's a man who believes in letting destructive capitalism work, going through a bankruptcy -- for the Wall Street banks -- Romney, who claims to be -- you know, hails from southwest Michigan and be a great defender of -- and understanding of the industrial heartland of this area, where he supported his friends on Wall Street, but did not support the auto industry. And that's where the -- I think the inconsistency is. It's not in my position.VAN SUSTEREN: Do you find that the voters in Michigan are asking you about that? I mean, is that -- is that an issue, the bailout? I mean, we're pretty far removed from Michigan, but I imagine that the auto industry and the bail-out's a big issue for them.SANTORUM: Well, certainly, every reporter has asked me about it here, every talk show host and television show that I've been on. But I haven't been asked by any voters. But it certainly is something that is on the minds of the people here, I assume of southeastern Michigan. And it has -- they have every right to be.And again, it's the same thing between me and Governor Romney. If you're looking for consistency, someone who actually believes in and tries to live out in their -- in their public policy that -- you know, the economic plan that I put forward, and you see a consistency in my record, you'll see it with me, you won't see it with Governor Romney.And this is just one of many issues where he has been on both sides of the issue, being for it in some cases, against it in others, and now trying to explain, you know, why he picked big banks over big auto.VAN SUSTEREN: OK, if you're president tonight, what are you doing about Syria tonight?SANTORUM: I think we should be helping the Syrian rebels. I mean, we should be at least providing some arms to them. We should, to the extent that we can through other sources, even provide some -- some other types of support.This is -- this is an opportunity to get rid of a satellite country of Iran as Iran is becoming much more menacing. We have an opportunity here to get rid of a very bad actor in the region. And candidly, we can't replace him with anything worse than what they have.I mean, that's -- that's sort of the -- you know, you look at Gadhafi. Gadhafi was pretty neutered. Assad has been a very active advocate for Iran and a -- and a tool for them and he -- as far as I'm concerned, we should do what we can, without getting directly involved, to be helpful to the rebels in overthrowing him.VAN SUSTEREN: All right, some campaign advice. If you have a chance, go up to Mackinaw Island. There are probably only about 300 votes, at most, during the winter, but it's the most beautiful part of all of Michigan.SANTORUM: It's beautiful.VAN SUSTEREN: Beautiful!SANTORUM: Yes, it is.VAN SUSTEREN: It doesn't have many voters in the middle of...SANTORUM: I've been there. It's great.VAN SUSTEREN: ... winter, but boy, it is -- it is a beautiful place to be. Anyway, Senator, thank you. I hope you come back before the -- in a short time. Thank you, sir.SANTORUM: Thanks, Greta."
