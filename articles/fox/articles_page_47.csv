This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MARIA BARTIROMO, HOST: Good morning.The speaker of the House stepping down as the presidential race heats up.Good morning, everyone. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Welcome to ""Sunday Morning Futures.""John Boehner's sudden resignation getting mixed reactions from GOP leaders this morning. So where does the party stand and how does Boehner's decision impact the race to the White House?Plus, President Obama seeing eye to eye with Chinese President Xi on cybersecurity a few months after a major government hack linked to the far east superpower. Former U.S Ambassador Jon Huntsman on that and whether we can bring some of those jobs in China back home to America.Plus, basketball Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar with strong words for some presidential candidates. He says they're sending the wrong message on the campaign trail, as we look ahead this morning on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""A lightning bolt hits Washington. The man second in line for the presidency, after the vice president, and one of the most powerful figures on Capitol Hill calling it quits. Late last week, House Speaker John Boehner sending shockwaves through Congress, announcing he will step down from his leadership post and his House seat at the end of October. The surprise resignation raising questions of why he did it and who will replace him. Byron York is chief political correspondent for The Washington Examiner and a Fox News contributor.Byron, good to have you on the program today. Thanks so much for joining us.BRYAN YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: What is the impact of Boehner's resignation?YORK: Well, there's no doubt that there are a lot of conservatives in Washington who are cheering over this. There was a really big conservative gathering in Washington on Friday, and when Boehner's resignation was announced, there was a standing ovation. They were cheering. So they're very happy.The problem is the next speaker, which is probably going to be Representative Kevin McCarthy, is going to face the same problems that Boehner did. The biggest one is, a minority of Democratic senators in the House can stop whatever Republicans want to do. If they want to defund ObamaCare, that can be stopped in the Senate. If they want to defund Planned Parenthood, that can be stopped in the Senate. So the frustrations that conservatives feel about not being able to work their will in Washington are going to still be there.BARTIROMO: Yes, and I - and I guess conservatives wanted to see a bigger dent in ObamaCare. They wanted to be a big - see a bigger dent in immigration. Or maybe they just wanted to see more bills passed that landed on the president's desk that the president would then veto. How come we didn't see that, Byron? We speak about this a lot when the Republicans first won in November. That's where they said they were going to do, put lots of bills in front of the president and then he would veto them and that would show the president's legacy. How come that hasn't happened?YORK: Yes, a lot of conservatives just wanted to see more fight. I mean some of them said, look, we know you're not going to win every one of these fights, but we want to see you fight. The fact is they ran up against numbers in the Senate. For example, the president's executive action on immigration, a lot of Republicans wanted to overturn that. They could not do so. Besides, Republicans themselves were a little bit divided about that.Same thing on ObamaCare. And now you're seeing the same thing play out with the Planned Parenthood fight. And that is, there are Republicans who were dead set against any sort of government shutdown strategy, that is attaching a Planned Parenthood defunding provision to a must pass spending bill, probably not going to happen now. So with a mixture of Republican divisions, plus remaining Democratic strength even in the minority in the Senate, Republicans have not been able to get anything done.BARTIROMO: Yes, yes, you're absolutely right.OK, we want to talk a bit more about some of the things that Boehner was working on, like the Dodd Frank legislation. Where does that stand? As well as that potential government shutdown, this upcoming week, October 1. So stay with us, Byron. A lot to talk about with you.But we want to also look at Speaker Boehner's departure and what it may mean for the entire Republican Party going forward. Fox News senior correspondent Eric Shawn with that angle.Eric, good morning to you.ERIC SHAWN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria, and good morning, everyone.What's next? You know, John Boehner's departure could bring new opportunity or more of the same to Washington.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: I now pass this gavel and the sacred trust that goes with it to the new speaker. God bless you, Speaker Boehner.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHAWN: He started with such fresh hope and prospects. The bartender's son from Ohio was sent into the speakership nearly five years ago. But a stunningly surprising exit has unleashed uncertainty and criticism.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's not about him or anybody else and I'm not here today to - to - to bash anyone, but the time has come to turn the page. The time has come to turn the page and allow a new generation of leadership in this country.SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If it is correct that the speaker, before he resigns, has cut a deal with Nancy Pelosi to fund the Obama administration for the rest of the (INAUDIBLE), that is not the behavior one would expect of the Republican speaker.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHAWN: Well, a variety of potential candidates, more conservative than Boehner in the running. As Byron pointed out, the odds are that number two majority leader California Congressman Kevin McCarthy is now the leading candidate. And the most recent Fox News poll starkly illustrates the Republican divide. It shows the majority of Republican primary voters, 62 percent, say they feel betrayed by their party. And some, like ""Investor Business Daily,"" predict the unexpected vacancy brings new possibilities saying, quote, ""this is not a setback. It's an opportunity. But whoever replaces Boehner, it had better be someone of vision and aggressiveness. GOP supporters are sick of feeling betrayed.""Well, in the wake of Mr. Boehner's departure, there are calls that Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also should walk the plank. However it all shakes out, it seems the number one priority for the next speaker will be to try and stop some of his colleagues from continuing to shoot inside the tent and instead aim their legislative fire at the Democrats, which, after all, is why the Republican voters sent them to Capitol Hill in the first place.Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes, a great analysis, Eric, thanks so much. Eric Shawn there.More now with our guest this morning, Byron York, chief political correspondent for The Washington Examiner.And, Byron, a brand-new Fox poll shows political outsiders still leading in the GOP race for the nomination. Donald Trump on top with 26 percent. Ben Carson, not far behind, at 18 percent. Carly Fiorina, Senator Marco Rubio are tied for third with 9 percent. You are looking at this and you have to believe that this is one of the reasons that Boehner was basically saw the light to step down. People are sick and tired of the establishment.YORK: Yes, a lot of news in that. One is that Trump is still strong, even though he's probably a little lower than he was in late August, early September, Trump is still strong. Just a huge jump by Carly Fiorina after her debate performance in - at the Reagan Library. Marco Rubio, you just saw him, he was addressing that big conservative conference in Washington. Clearly coming up after his debate performances.The other two big things to remember, when you talk about this outsider versus establishment thing, Jeb Bush has lost about half of his support since July, a really, really big development there. And, of course, Scott Walker is the biggest loser of all, was thought to appeal to some establishment types and now he's out of the race altogether.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a great point. It - what do you think Jeb Bush has to do now I mean after losing all of that support?YORK: Well, if you talk to the Bush people, they say slow and steady, slow and steady, this is a marathon, this is not any quick race for the - for today's polls. But the thing is, he needs to win Iowa or New Hampshire is what he needs to do and he is not in a strong position in either one. The Bush campaign talks about how, you know, you go on. There's South Carolina and Nevada, Florida, the SEC primaries, all of these other races, but Republican candidates for president come from either the winner of Iowa or New Hampshire. Very unusual to lose both and go on. So I think you'll eventually see Jeb Bush putting a lot of energy into those early states.BARTIROMO: Right. And what do you think the - the policy around Jeb Bush is, that - that is mostly sort of, you know, thought about when he talks. I mean we're still waiting for sort of granularity and specifics on policy from all of the candidates. What do you think we think about when you think about Jeb Bush in terms of what he's strongest on?YORK: Well, he would say that he's already rolled out a tax plan, he's already made him - made his positions clear on - on a number of things. I think the problem with Bush is that he's just not really excited very many people. He has not connected with people. You know, he was on the Stephen Colbert show earlier and he was asked about the exclamation point at the end of his name, Jeb, in the logo, and he said it, quote, ""co-notes (ph) excitement."" And, of course, the funny part of that was, it actually doesn't. So I think he actually needs to connect more with voters and that's just not happening in a big way right now.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's really funny, actually. That's a good - that's a very good point.Back to the Boehner story. Let me get your take on the impact in terms of the economy and markets. First off, do you expect that the government shuts down on Thursday, this upcoming week? And what are the most important sort of items on the agenda that Boehner was working on that perhaps could be up for question right now?YORK: First of all, on the government shutdown, absolutely not. Just - I just don't see that happening. And on the agenda, yes, there are plenty of things that could be done, financial reform, tax reform. Remember, the Republicans have never, ever rolled out their own alternative to Obamacare that they've all united behind. So there were a lot of things that they could do. But I cannot overemphasize the degree to which a lot of Republican leaders in Washington believe that nothing is going to happen until there's a new president. So I think what you're going to see is a lot of standing in place measures. You know, funding - funding bills that just keep the government funded at its current level. No big policy changes. Essentially nothing happening until the presidential election is resolved.BARTIROMO: Yes.YORK: I think that's a very, very strong opinion among top Republicans here in Washington.BARTIROMO: For sure. So at this moment in time, who does Byron York think that person will be?YORK: You know, I have long ago --BARTIROMO: Stick your neck out, Bryon. Come on.YORK: I have long ago gotten out of the presidential election prediction business. I mean I will tell you a lot of insiders certainly believe that Carson and Trump will eventually fade. They are very impressed with Fiorina's strength. They believe that Marco Rubio has all of the - all of the factors that they want to see in a general election candidate.BARTIROMO: Right.YORK: But I'll tell you, who a week ago would have thought that Scott Walker would be out of the race and that John Boehner would no longer be speaker?BARTIROMO: Yes.YORK: There are a lot of surprises going on --BARTIROMO: Sure are.YORK: And there's no reason to believe they're going to stop.BARTIROMO: Byron, thank you so much. We will see you soon, sir.YORK: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Byron York there.The leaders of the world's two largest economies agreeing to fight cybercrime, but can President Obama and the Chinese president really put an end to this major national security problem?Follow us on Twitter @mariabartiromo, @sundayfutures. We're talking with Jon Huntsman coming up. What would you like to hear from him about China.Stay with us. We're looking ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.President Obama talking cybersecurity with the president of China. The two leaders meeting at the White House on Friday, both promising to join together to fight cyber theft of intellectual property. Despite that pledge, President Obama is still open to slapping sanctions on Beijing. He also pointed that out that cybercrimes are playing out on a one way street.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I raised, once again, our very serious concerns about growing cyber threats to American companies and American citizens. I indicated that it has to stop. The United States government does not engage in cyber economic espionage for commercial gain.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman is also a former U.S. ambassador to China and we welcome him to the program.Sir, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.JOHN HUNTSMAN JR., FORMER GOVERNOR OF UTAH: Thanks, Maria. Delighted.BARTIROMO: Your observation to the Chinese president's visit and specifically as it relates to cybercrime.HUNTSMAN: Well, listen, the Chinese are playing the long game and as such they're benefiting enormously from intellectual property theft, mostly from U.S. firms, which is probably costing the United States and our economy $200 billion to $300 billion per year. So we play the short game typically here in the United States. Xi Jinping, clearly, in this visit, which really was his first as head of the party and head of state, was to telegraph back to his constituencies at home that he's strong, he's capable, he's a leader on the world stage, he can manage the most important relationship in the world.And for us, we clearly wanted deliverables. There weren't any deliverables on the South China Sea, which is probably the most pressing security challenge in our relationship. And there was a little bit of language in the joint statement relevant to IP theft. But in terms of really doing anything about it, with articulated sanctions or a threat to do something if China doesn't stop their behavior, really wasn't laid out. So words are cheap. We're going to see if in the aftermath - because there will be additional IP theft incidents, there's no doubt about that - if the United States will be willing to do what some of us called for a couple of years ago in a major IP theft report, which is to use the power of our market to block products that are coming in, developed by companies that are stealing our intellectual property, which, again, is robbing us of jobs, it's robbing us of innovation and longer term it's really hurting our economy.BARTIROMO: Right. So do you think that was threatened or discussed? I mean, you know, we can say things, the president can say things about how important this issue is and we are not going to tolerate it, but like you said, it's just words.HUNTSMAN: Well, yes.BARTIROMO: So was this meeting just a joyride or did - I mean you said there were no deliverables.HUNTSMAN: The - the - the - I've been in these meetings a thousand times and the Chinese like words and they like joint statements, but they respect leverage. And you have to have leverage in the game if you're going to make any progress at all. And as it relates to IP theft, the leverage we have that they respect most and they fear most is closing down our market. So the idea that you might deploy section 337 of the U.S. Trade Act to block goods that are coming into the United States made by Chinese companies that are ripping off our intellectual property is something we ought to consider. The idea that Chinese companies are gaining access to capital from financial institutions, where it ought to be blocked and it ought to be treated as if it were a money laundering case, is something that should be considered.The idea that Chinese companies ultimately want to go public on the New York Stock Exchange, there ought to be some provision whereby there's a review process with the SEC, where if a company has been involved at all in ripping off U.S. intellectual property, then there ought to be some sort of sanction against that. So these are all areas that clearly would get the attention of the Chinese, but I'm not sure they were spelled out in any specific detail.BARTIROMO: I think you make a great point all around because all of the things that you're hitting on really resonate with the American people. But let's be honest, I mean, none of that was said, so there really isn't any of that sort of hard hitting America will do this if this keeps up. So here we are, and nothing -HUNTSMAN: Here - here we are.BARTIROMO: So nothing happened.HUNTSMAN: Here we are.BARTIROMO: This was just a photo-op then, governor.HUNTSMAN: It - this - this was a Rose Harden photo-op with a joint statement. But I have to give the administration credit for at least enshrining the whole issue of intellectual property theft in the joint statement. That has been tried before and no one has ever succeeded in getting the Chinese to at least admit to it and begin to frame the discussion.Now the conversation has been framed. There's not a lot of content to it. It's been framed and we'll see where it goes from here. Now you begin adding content, which is a very crystal clear understanding between the United States and China that if IP theft is ripped off, there will be immediate consequences that will be quite painful.BARTIROMO: Now, of course he-- you know --HUNTSMAN: That -- oh, that will have to come next and we'll see.BARTIROMO: He's speaking to the United Nations General Assembly tomorrow, the president of China is. And, of course, this is just a few weeks after the negotiations over the transpacific partnership, the TPP, trade deal. Any conversation about that, the fact that China is not involved in that?HUNTSMAN: China's not involved in that. It includes 12 countries of the Asia Pacific region representing about 40 percent of the world's GDP. China has its own version of TPP.BARTIROMO: Right.HUNTSMAN: It's called r-sap (ph). And it's generally done with their free trade partners in the region. The big difference is, their standards for engagement on trade are at a much lower level than ours. TPP will be a gold plated agreement once it is done, probably first quarter of 2016. The trick, Maria, going forward will be, how do you link r-sap with TPP such that trade flows and investment patterns aren't disrupted.BARTIROMO: Right.HUNTSMAN: Ultimately you could see two trade agreements mature in the Asia Pacific region, with is the most important economic region of the world, with different standards. And that would be a horrible outcome for prosperity in the region and for U.S. exports.BARTIROMO: Right.HUNTSMAN: So I hope - and there may have been some conversation about how you bridge TPP longer term -BARTIROMO: Yes, that's -HUNTSMAN: With - with China's view of trade.BARTIROMO: Exactly.Governor, good to have you on the program.HUNTSMAN: Great to be with you.BARTIROMO: Ambassador, thank you so much. We'll see you soon.HUNTSMAN: Thank you. A pleasure.BARTIROMO: Jon Huntsman.Some campaign trail moments turning heads for the wrong reason. We'll talk about it. Ben Carson's comments with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.Back in a minute.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.As we move towards electing a new president of the United States, attack ads and messages isolating certain races or cultures are often overtaking talk about policies to move the country forward. My next guest says it is getting in the way of getting the real messages out there. Kareem Abdul- Jabbar is with us today, a basketball Hall of Famer, author of the new book ""Mycroft Holmes: A Modern Take on Sherlock Holmes.""And, Kareem, it is wonderful to have you on the show today.KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR, BASKETBALL HALL OF FAMER: Nice to be here, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.I want to get to the book in a moment because I know you are a prolific writer. We talked years ago about how - your children's books. So I'll get to that in a moment. But first I want to talk about what's going on in this election cycle, and that is the most recent comments from Dr. Ben Carson. He has backpedaled a bit basically saying he would accept a Muslim in the White House so long as that person rejected sharia law. We know that sharia law means, you know, killing homosexuals, women are subservient to men. Tell me about sharia law. You converted to Islam how many years ago?ABDUL-JABBAR: In 1967. A long time ago. But Islam does not OK the things that you just mentioned, killing people, rape, all of these things that have been associated now with sharia law. That's crazy. None of the people that have that criticism of sharia law have checked out the law because it's not even for non-Muslims. Sharia law is for the ruling of an Islamic state. So sharia law could never apply here in America because America is a very diverse place.So they - they've got it all wrong. They don't know what the law states actually. And they want to distort it in order to make Muslims the villain. And there's enough real villainy going on without people investing it.BARTIROMO: What has happened in this country that we are, in fact, tolerating, you know, this kind of talk, like, for example, what Donald Trump said about Mexicans.ABDUL-JABBAR: Right. Well, I think that it's very frustrating when we're being attacked by people that we don't understand and it's really easy to make up scenarios that justify our anger, our need to retaliate, our need to try to find some way to eliminate this threat. I understand that. But you can't do that in a way that takes a whole group of people and - and marks them for - for being targets of bigotry.BARTIROMO: Of course.ABDUL-JABBAR: That - that's - it doesn't work. It ends up being more of a problem than a solution. And people have to get to that point where they understand that.BARTIROMO: You know, I wanted you to come on this program now for a long time because you and I have spoken in the past and you've always been such a practical speaker about these issues. And I think most people don't realize how, you know, passionate you are about these subjects. For example, I don't think most people realize that your father was a New York City police officer.ABDUL-JABBAR: No, they don't and -BARTIROMO: And -ABDUL-JABBAR: My grandfather also was a police officer in west (ph) (INAUDIBLE).BARTIROMO: Exactly. So you've got the NYPD in your blood -ABDUL-JABBAR: Yes.BARTIROMO: And yet look what's happening with the NYPD today. Under attack. There are way too many shootings in this country.ABDUL-JABBAR: Yes.BARTIROMO: What do you have to say about this?ABDUL-JABBAR: I - I think it's very unfortunate that the whole idea of an overuse of force can be applied just to a certain group. I have a lot of family that live in Brooklyn.BARTIROMO: So do I.ABDUL-JABBAR: And in Brownsville. And it's a very violent place. And they understand the need for polices - for policemen to be active there. But the beliefs seem to overstep their - their mandate sometimes and too many corpses are in the morgue for no good reason. And that's a - that's a problem that has to be dealt with. But we can't - we can't abandon our - our need and support for the police, but they have to find - try to find a way not to overstep the bounds when it comes to force.BARTIROMO: Let me get to the book. You've written several children's books. And that's also why I was so impressed with you because you are - I mean it's a passion of yours to educate our young people. This is your first novel, though.ABDUL-JABBAR: Yes.BARTIROMO: It's about Sherlock Holmes' brother.ABDUL-JABBAR: Yes.BARTIROMO: Tell us about the book.ABDUL-JABBAR: The book is about Sherlock Holmes' brother, Mycroft, who has always been a mystery to people because he's not very - mentioned very often in the regular cannon or Arthur Conan Doyle's stories. But Mycroft is someone who is back in the shadows. Sherlock describes him as someone who is overweight and sedentary. He doesn't go anywhere except to his offices, his apartment, and the Diogenes Club, which he helped found. And the rule at the Diogenes Club is that you can't talk. And that - that's all - that's all we know about him. So it left a - a huge area for us to form his back story.So we're talking about 20 years before Sherlock becomes the world's greatest consulting detective. We're talking about his brother who has just graduated from Cambridge just two years on and has a great job at the British foreign office. And he's doing very well. He's an up and coming person in the foreign office. And people are very impressed with him. And his best friend, Cyrus Douglas, a gentleman from the West Indies, tells him that strange and horrible things are happening and he has to go home to investigate it. And that starts us on our - our little adventure.BARTIROMO: I know you've been very supportive of President Obama.ABDUL-JABBAR: Yes.BARTIROMO: Do you feel that the African-American community needs to hold him to account in terms of their economic lives?We haven't had much success under his watch...ABDUL-JABBAR: Right.BARTIROMO: -- which is surprising.ABDUL-JABBAR: Well, for black Americans, it's been very difficult because President Obama is the president for everybody. He's not just the African- American president.So he has to deal with issues and policies that affect everyone and he can't -- he can't just devote himself to issues that are -- only resonate within the black community. That is not his job and I don't blame him. He's in a very difficult position.But he's -- he's tried to do what he can do and I don't criticize him in that sense.BARTIROMO: Kareem, it's great to have you on the show today.ABDUL-JABBAR: Oh, it's great to be here.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.ABDUL-JABBAR: Thank you.BARTIROMO: It's really nice to see you again.ABDUL-JABBAR: My pleasure.BARTIROMO: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.We are watching Pope Francis on his last day of his busy three city trip to the United States.But before he swaps his pope mobile for a plane home to Rome, he could see the biggest crowds of his whole visit yet.Plus, we're getting into Hillary Clinton next with the panel.We're looking ahead right now on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SHAWN: Hello, I'm Eric Shawn.Pope Francis, as you can see, now just arriving back in Philadelphia. He's expected to speak about -- to about 100 inmates at the Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility there.We will, of course, bring you that when it happens.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Eric.Hillary Clinton's favorability ratings taking a hit in the latest Fox News Poll.Take a look at these numbers. A record high, 56 percent of the people polled, now have an unfavorable opinion of Mrs. Clinton. Only 38 percent view her favorably and she is losing support from a key voting bloc -- women.Half of them now rate her negatively.So is this time to pack for the Hillary clan -- camp?We want to bring in our panel.Ed Rollins, former White House advisor to President Reagan, a long-time strategist to business and political leaders. He is also a Fox News political analyst.Judith Miller, a Pulitzer-Prize winning author and journalist and a Fox News contributor.And Mary Kissel, a ""Wall Street Journal"" editorial board member.Good to see everybody.Thank you so much for joining us.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good morning.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hi.BARTIROMO: I want to get into Hillary right away on these polls.What do you think this shows (INAUDIBLE)?ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, first, these numbers, any other candidate would be a death knell. You would basically drop out of the race and not run and not be electable. You can't underestimate Hillary Clinton, though. And at the end of the day, the Democratic Party still has a lot of people that want her to be the nominee.I think there's no alternative at this point in time. Sanders is not an alternative. If Biden gets in, then you've got a race. And it -- and the race will be something like the Mondale-Gary Hart race. It will go on and on and on.BARTIROMO: We're going to interrupt right here for a moment, because we have a Fox News alert.Pope Francis now arriving back in Philadelphia, where he will speak to about 100 inmates.Let's listen in.POPE FRANCIS (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): Is condemned to imprison itself and to fall prey to its own sufferings. I stand among you a pastor, a shepherd, but above all, as your brother, to share in your plight and make it my own.I am here that we may join in prayer and bring before our God everything that causes us pain. But to also bring everything that gives us hope so that we may receive from him the power of the resurrection.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dear brothers and sisters, thank you for receiving me and giving me the opportunity to be here with you and to share this time in your lives. It is a difficult time, one full of struggles. I know it is a painful time not only for you, but also for your families and for all of society.Any society, any family which cannot share or take seriously the pain of its children and views that pain as something normal or to be expected is a society condemned to remain a hostage to itself, prey to the very things that cause that pain.I am here as a pastor, but above all, as a brother, to share your situation and to make it my own.I have come so that we can pray together and offer our God everything that causes us pain, but, also everything that gives us hope so that we can receive from him the power of the resurrection.POPE FRANCIS: I am reminded of the gospel, when Jesus washes the feet of his disciples at the Last Supper. And the disciples were puzzled by this. Peter even refused and he said, ""Ye shall never wash my feet.""UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think of the gospel scene where Jesus washes the feet of his disciples at the Last Supper. This was something his disciples found hard to accept. Even Peter refused and told him, ""Ye will never wash my feet.""POPE FRANCIS: Back then, when you went to visit someone, the host would wash your feet. People were traditionally welcomed this way because the roads were not paved. They were covered in dust, with petals that would get stuck in your sandals. After walking on these roads, everyone's feet were caked in dust, bruised or cut from the stones.So there was Jesus, washing feet, our feet, his disciples' feet.In those days it was accustomed to wash someone's feet when they came to your home. That was how they welcomed people. The roads were not paved. They were covered with dust and little stones would get stuck in your sandals. Everyone walked those roads, which left their feet dusty, bruised or cut from those stones. That is why we see Jesus washing feet, our feet, the feet of his disciples, then and now.Life is a journey along different roads, different paths, which leave their mark on us.(APPLAUSE)We know in faith that Jesus seeks us out; he wants to heal our wounds, to soothe our feet, which hurt from traveling alone, to wash each of us clean of the dust from our journey. He doesn't ask us where we have been. He doesn't question us what about we've done -- about what we've done. Rather, he tells us, unless I wash your feet, you have no share with me. Unless I wash your feet, I will not be able to give you the life which the Father always dreamed of, the life for which he created you.Jesus comes to us so that he can restore our dignity as children of God. He wants to help us to set out again, to resume our journey, to recover our hope, to restore our faith and trust. He wants us to keep walking along the paths of life, to realize that we have a mission and that confinement is not the same thing as exclusion.Life means getting our feet dirty in the dust-filled roads of life and of history. All of us need to be cleansed, to be washed, always. And I am the first among. All of us are being sought out by the teacher who wants to help us resume our journey. The Lord goes searching for us all to give us his hand.It's painful when we see prison systems which are not concerned to care for wounds, to soothe pain, to offer new possibilities. It is painful when we see people who think that only some others need to be cleansed, purified, and do not recognize that their weariness, pain and wounds are also the weariness, pain and wounds of society as a whole.The Lord tells us this clearly with a sign. He washes our feet so we can come back to the table, the table from which he wishes no one to be excluded, the table which has been prepared for all of us and to which all of us are invited.This time in your life can have but one purpose, to give you a helping hand to get back on the right path, to give you a hand to help you rejoin society. All of us are part of that effort; all of us are invited to encourage, help and enable your rehabilitation, your rehabilitation which everyone seeks and desires, inmates and their families, correctional authorities, social and educational programs, a rehabilitation which benefits and elevates the morale of the entire community and of society as a whole.I would like to encourage you to have this attitude among you and with all other people who are part of this institution, forge opportunities for one another, forge paths, forge new roadways.All of us have something we need to be cleansed of or purified from -- all of us. May the knowledge of that fact inspire us to live in solidarity, to support one another and seek the best for others.Let us look to Jesus, who washes our feet. He is the way, the truth and the life. He comes to save us from the lie that says that no one can change, the lie that says that no one can change. He helps us to journey along the paths of life and fulfillment. May the power of his love and his resurrection always be a path leading you to a new life.And as we are seated now in silence, we ask the Lord to bless us. May God bless you and protect you and make his face shine upon you. And may he grant you peace. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: All right. That was Pope Francis speaking to those inmates. We're going to keep following the Pope's trip and bring it back to you live as -- as the news warrants.We're with our panel this morning, Ed Rollins, Judy Miller, and Mary Kissel, talking about Hillary Clinton and the latest e-mail developments.Ed, you made a great point before we went to the Pope. Mary, I want you to jump in here. Because Hillary Clinton made comments about this this morning.MARY KISSEL, WALL STREET JOURNAL: That's right. She says she's been ""as transparent as possible"" about her e-mail account. And it's simply a lie, Maria. Nothing she has said so far has turned out to be true.It was a server for her private e-mail. Now we know it was for government work. She says she's turned over all of the e-mails; then we find out she's deleted 30,000 of them. She claims the state's request was routine. We find out that it was unusual. She says she started using the e-mail account in March; now we find out that she was using it in January of her tender. No classified information -- the inspector general tells us that there is classified information here. Nothing here holds up. And that's why her polls are falling.ROLLINS: Well, this is a longtime pattern. You have to remember, when she was the first lady and Whitewater was the front and center, she could not find the Rose Law Firm documents.(LAUGHTER)She was subpoenaed by several congressional committees, by legal -- two years later, she said, ""Oh, we found it in the closet of the White House,"" as if you don't know -- you know, after the thing was...BARTIROMO: Right.ROLLINS: And it's the same pattern.BARTIROMO: The poll numbers have been reflecting this, right? I mean, Joe Biden is not even in the race and there are polls that say that he could beat her.JUDITH MILLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, he's waiting to see what happens; he may wait too long, but the fact that Bill Clinton had to go on the air today to defend his wife, to say that she's the victim of the media -- it's all our fault. No, Mr. Clinton, I'm sorry, it is not all our fault. It happens to be the fault of the candidate who was the most respected person when she started this campaign, the most respected woman in America, but whose lies and inconsistencies and mis-statements have finally caught up with her.And that's what's going on here. But to blame the media is vintage Bill Clinton. It's not going to work this time.(CROSSTALK)KISSEL: Well, you know it's bad...(LAUGHTER)You know it's bad when Bill Clinton is -- is jumping in, right?MILLER: Right, the big dog.KISSEL: You know, that is -- that is a new low.(LAUGHTER)But -- but Hillary Clinton -- and this is separate and distinct from the job that she did as secretary of state. We're not even talking about that disastrous run.BARTIROMO: Yeah, it's interesting. I mean, when you look at what's going on with Bernie Sanders and of course Joe Biden as well, you really then feel the impact.ROLLINS: If you would have taken the weakest member of the Senate and said he's going to go out and give her a full-scale run for her money, Bernie Sanders, a back-bencher, a socialist candidate, and he's given her everything -- she's ahead now and New Hampshire -- shows the vulnerability that's there.BARTIROMO: And, of course, this, with Bernie Sanders wanting 92 percent tax rates.Let me get your take on John Boehner and the resignation.ROLLINS: Big story, obviously, and I'm not shocked by it. John, I think, was tired of the battle. I think the timing of it is what shocked everybody. In a way, it's good for the Republicans because they're going to pick a new leader. They're going to have a real fight here in the next couple weeks to decide who that's going to be. I mean, Kevin McCarthy is the obvious choice -- that's the number two guy -- but he had better make a lot of concessions to the conservatives; otherwise he won't last very long, either.BARTIROMO: What do you think, Judy?MILLER: I think this shows that there's a kind of full-fledged civil war within the Republican Party. I noticed that Bobby Jindal, when he was asked about what happened, said ""Mitch McConnell is next,"" referring to the Senate. They -- the Tea Party intends to take down the leadership. I think that bodes very ill for Republicans.KISSEL: I think it shows there's a faction of the party that wants gimmicks and stunts and doesn't actually want to accomplish anything.Let's be clear. John Boehner did have accomplishments in a very difficult time for his speakership, the sequester, a major accomplishment, big fall in government spending as a percentage of GDP; the expiry of the Export/Import Bank, trade promotion authority, limited entitlement reform.It's simply not true to say John Boehner didn't do anything or John Boehner wasn't a conservative. He absolutely was, but Republicans have to understand that they will not accomplish major reform with President Obama in the White House. That's how our system of government works. You have to take back the White House...(CROSSTALK)KISSEL: ... and keep Republican control of Congress.ROLLINS: At the end of the day -- I don't disagree with any of that, and John Boehner's been a friend of mine for a long, long time, and I have great respect for him. He was not what they needed today. It was a whole different Congress. And he could not count and figure out who those dissidents were and he couldn't please them.And at the end of the day, all the things you talked about were great for the president, maybe great for the business community, but to the hard-core conservatives out there, they were not positive things.BARTIROMO: Yeah, and not to mention -- but he did protect people from higher taxes. He pushed back on Obama policies...ROLLINS: He did, he did.BARTIROMO: ... I guess as much as he could.Let's take a short break and then look at the one thing to watch that's most important for the week ahead. We're watching ""Sunday Morning Futures."" We're back in a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: We're back with our panel, looking at what's most important. You're looking at the meeting between Putin and Obama, Judy?MILLER: I certainly am. I want to see whether or not we're going to have an Iranian/Syrian deal between those two very powerful men.BARTIROMO: Mary, what's most important?KISSEL: GOP leadership battle: Does Kevin McCarthy win the day? And if so, what kind of policy direction is he going to set for the party?BARTIROMO: Ed Rollins?ROLLINS: Obviously, this is a big week for the U.N. up here and we'll see if the president steps up and if he can compete on the stage with Putin and with Premier (sic) Xi.BARTIROMO: All right. Great to have you all. Thank you so much.And tomorrow, big interview on ""Mornings With Maria"" on the Fox Business Network. I'll be talking with Jeb Bush. I'll also be talking with Eric Cantor and Madeleine Albright. Join us.That will do it for ""Sunday Morning Futures"" today. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Tomorrow, ""Mornings with Maria"" is from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Eastern on the Fox Business Network Here's where to find FBN.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)SEAN HANNITY, HOST (voice-over): Tonight...DR. BEN CARSON R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Anybody, regardless of their religion or affiliation, if they embrace American values and they place the Constitution at the top level, then I'm supportive of them.HANNITY: Dr. Benjamin Carson clarifies his comments about a Muslim being president. Mark Steyn is here tonight with reaction.CARLY FIORINA R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The world is a more dangerous place.HANNITY: Then Carly Fiorina unveils her foreign policy plans amid a surge in the polls.FIORINA: Terrorism is not waning as a threat, as our president tried to reassure us.HANNITY: Newt Gingrich will weigh in on the shrinking GOP field.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The scale of this crisis is outstanding.HANNITY: And a special report from the front lines of the refugee crisis. All of that plus Frank Luntz reveals which candidate is connecting best with you, the voters.""Hannity"" starts right here, right now.(END VIDEOTAPE)HANNITY: Welcome to ""Hannity."" Tonight, Dr. Ben Carson continues to be attacked by the media and politicians or his comments about a Muslim being president, while Hillary Clinton gets a free pass for what she and her campaign did back in 2008. We'll have more on that in just a moment.But first, Dr. Carson -- he clarified his remarks that caused such an uproar last night right here on this program. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARSON: If someone has a Muslim background and they're willing to reject those tenets and to accept the way of life that we have and clearly will swear to place our Constitution above their religion, then, of course, they will be considered infidels and heretics, but at least I would then be quite willing to support them.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Now, Hillary Clinton was quick to attack Dr. Carson for his original remark. She wrote on Twitter, quote, ""Can a Muslim be president of the United States of America? In a word, yes. Now let's move on.""Now, we've got to remind you, our viewers, that back during the 2008 campaign, Hillary Clinton and her staffers -- they were trying to raise questions about then-Senator Obama's faith. You may remember this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEVE KROFT, CBS NEWS: You don't believe that Senator Obama's a Muslim.HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Of course not. I mean, that's -- you know, there is no basis for that. You know, I take him on the basis of what he says. And you know, there isn't any reason to doubt that.KROFT: You said you take Senator Obama at his word that he's not a Muslim. You don't believe that he's a Muslim, and you're implying...CLINTON: No. No, I'm not. There's -- no, there is nothing to base that on, as far as I know.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: ""As far as I know.""Joining me for reaction, the author of ""A Disgrace to the Profession,"" Mark Steyn is with us. Mark, it goes deeper than that. The Politico reported, the Telegraph reported, Mediaite reported, all these outlets reminded us that it was the Clinton campaign that circulated an e-mail questioning Obama's citizenship.Quote, ""Barack Obama's mother was living in Kenya with his Arab- African father late in her pregnancy. She was not allowed to travel at the time. So Barack Obama was born there, and his mother took him to Hawaii to register his birth,"" according to the e-mail chain that they sent out, the Clintons sent out!MARK STEYN, ""A DISGRACE TO THE PROFESSION"" AUTHOR: That's right.HANNITY: So she's the original birther, if you will!STEYN: Yes, that's a good way of putting it, Sean. A lot of the sinister, exotic, mysterious foreigner stuff about Obama was actually started by the Clinton campaign. He, to a certain extent, has done his best to vindicate some of it. But the fact is that this was an intra- Democratic Party dispute started by Hillary Clinton trying to paint Barack Obama as the exotic other. She started it, the original birther.HANNITY: Yes. And David Plouffe at the time said it's the most shameful, offensive fear-mongering we've ever seen. And people seem to forget they had to fire two Iowa staffers for circulating the e-mail! So you know, it's kind of funny Ben Carson says it, she's lecturing Ben Carson.Is this the highlight of hypocrisy on her part?STEYN: Well, I think it's actually worse than that. Ben Carson was asked a theoretical question. I mean, Muslims seem to be -- the Muslim question seems to be the equivalent to the contraception question four years ago. Nobody was talking about it. But suddenly, we've all go to have a view on whether there should be a Muslim president.Unless Donald Trump is planning on coming out as a Muslim, Bernie Sanders, maybe he's Muslim -- but there isn't actually a declared Muslim candidate.But Hillary is being particularly ridiculous because she specifically attacked a specific person for his faith and his background, whereas Ben Carson is just entirely legitimately answering a hypothetical.And there were plenty -- there are of reasons to look at the conflict between Islam and free societies and discuss that hypothetical.I mean, Hillary Clinton is resting on the Constitution. She says the Constitution doesn't impose a religious test. No, but it imposes -- the Constitution imposes a constitutional test. And for many observant Muslims, the paramountcy of the U.S. Constitution would be a significant problem if you were to become the chief executive.HANNITY: We can start with freedom of speech.STEYN: Right.HANNITY: I mean, those that are critical of Islam or the prophet, the punishment can be death. Or we can look at the application of sharia in Muslim countries today. And I went through this with Dr. Carson last night. In other words, in Saudi Arabia, women can't drive. They can't be seen in public without a male relative. There are other Muslim countries where women need four male eyewitnesses for rape.If you leave the faith, you are viewed as an apostate, the penalty of which is death.STEYN: Right.HANNITY: So I think it is legitimate and it is fair to say sharia, the application of Islam in Muslim countries, every one of them to some extent or another, is the antithesis of what our Constitution offers. So doesn't that make that argument more legitimate?STEYN: Yes, I think so. And what's ridiculous is that the same liberals who are saying, Oh, wouldn't it be lovely to have a Muslim president and make us even more delightfully diverse and multicultural, are the same people who a few months back were demonstrating outside the Beverly Hills Hotel, which is owned by the sultan of Brunei, and they say he's a big homophobe because the penalty for homosexuality in Brunei is stoning to death.Now, the sultan of Brunei is an urbane, civilized, charming man, and when his country was a British colony, it lived under English common law. And since it ceased to be a colony, it's been getting less and less common law and more and more sharia.Seventy years ago, Pakistan lived under common law, now it lives under Islamic law. Fifty years ago, Nigeria lived under English common law. Now half of it's under sharia.So clearly, the coming to power of observant, devout Muslims has driven a stake through the legal tradition and inheritance that...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: That also raises another question. The president, even though James Clapper and our State Department have told us, the highest levels in our intelligence community have told us that ISIS and al Qaeda will infiltrate the refugee population, that they want to take as many as 200,000. And I assume that number will go higher over time.You know, I happen to be of the belief that if we risk taking one radical Islamist into the country in the refugee population, that we have made a big mistake and put the entire country at risk. Are the Republicans going to fight back on that?STEYN: Well, I would certainly hope so. The fact is, several Republican candidates seem to think we should take these refugees and seem to think that we have the capacity to check their bona fides. I happened to go through U.S. immigration...HANNITY: And how do you do that?STEYN: ... and I was all concerned in case...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: How do you determine if someone's a genuine refugee or somebody is a terrorist that has been trained to lie to you and say that he's here for humanitarian reasons, for a better life for his family? He'll lie!STEYN: Well, they won't. They won't because it'll be a straight -- my lawyer told me that my application, they spent six minutes on it. I would think that, if anything, it's maybe down to three minutes by now. So I would imagine that most of these refugees, it will, in effect, be no more different than what's happening at the Hungarian border, where every so often, a bunch of them scramble across the fence and you don't know who the hell they are.And here they'll just be filling in the paper, but it'll still be exactly the same as scrambling over the fence. You'll have no clue who they are, what their real name is, where they came from.HANNITY: So sharia and the Constitution are at odds with each other. And that's what the American people need to know as we continue this debate.But stay right there. More Mark Steyn coming up right after the break.And now that Governor Scott Walker has suspended his campaign, what does that mean for the rest of the GOP field?Also, Carly Fiorina continues to rise in the polls after her very strong debate performance. We'll get reaction tonight from former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.We'll also have more on this refugee crisis. Do you want migrants pouring out of the Middle East into America? Should we be taking them in? Geraldo Rivera and I go one on one on that issue and much more.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. SCOTT WALKER, R-WIS., FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Today, I believe that I'm being called to lead by helping to clear the field in this race so that a positive conservative message can rise to the top of the field. With this in mind, I will suspend my campaign immediately.I encourage other Republican presidential candidates to consider doing the same so that the voters can focus on a limited number of candidates who can offer a positive conservative alternative to the current front-runner.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: That was Wisconsin governor Scott Walker last night announcing that he is suspending his presidential campaign. During the speech, Walker urged more candidates to consider to do the same, and he seemed to take a shot at Donald Trump there. What happened to the pledge that everyone would support the winner? And what does it mean for the GOP and the race for the White House?We continue with the author of the brand-new book, ""Disgrace to the Profession,"" columnist Mark Steyn.No matter what people say, this pledge that will support the eventual nominee doesn't seem to apply to Trump, even though everyone pressured him to sign it. Reaction.STEYN: No. Yes, people have been quite openly dismissive of it, including Scott Walker, who's basically saying that maybe another 12, 13 guys should bail on this competition and so -- so the anti-Trump figure will emerge, and that'll be the end of him.But the fact is, he's wrong. I mean, generally, in the last few weeks, there have been a handful of candidates near the top. Unfortunately for Scott Walker, they're not the ones he would have preferred. They're Trump and they're Ben Carson and they're Carly Fiorina.And just to go back to what we were talking about before the break, Sean, Scott Walker was not a credible candidate on, for example, the issue of the migrants pouring out of the Middle East. He said that was a hypothetical question and he wasn't ready to answer it. It wasn't a hypothetical. It's going on on our TV screens even as we speak.And so what that means is that he's basically saying he's a performing seal who hasn't been yet given his poll-tested answer by his consultants yet. And that's why Scott Walker pulled out.The idea that somehow, Scott Walker is now going to lead a sort of coalition of wise men who will unite the Republican Party against the joke candidate -- he -- he -- his campaign failed in part because on serious issues like that and on immigration and other issues, he turned himself into a joke.HANNITY: Let's talk about the Democrats. Let me just read off some headlines about Hillary just today. You have a charity watchdog group warning people not to donate to the Clinton Foundation. You have United talent agency in Hollywood -- they've turned their back. Now George Clooney reportedly is ready to support Biden in the race.You've got unions now that have put off their endorsement of Hillary, waiting to see if Biden gets in the race. And Klein has a new book coming out that raises serious issues about her health, that that might hurt her in her race. For the first time in New York, her poll numbers are underwater. And on top of that the Clinton camp is trying to warn Joe Biden about getting into the race.Add the e-mail scandal to this, how does she get to the finish line at this point?STEYN: Yes. Basically, Hillary has defeated Hillary. Nobody else -- nobody else can defeat Hillary. Hillary did this to herself.And if you're the president, it's not a difficult choice. Do you want the Democrat Party to go over the cliff with Hillary Clinton, or would you prefer to back another candidate, such as Joe Biden, who will be a more explicit third Obama term and hasn't -- and doesn't come tainted with all the sleaze?The sinful (ph) dynamic of the Democrat race has been that Obama loathes the Clintons, and he's the only guy who's ever successfully driven a stake through the heart of the Clinton machine four years -- eight years ago. And every indication is that Hillary is such a weak candidate that he's ready to do it all over again.HANNITY: All right, so look at it in a Mark Steyn crystal ball. Who'd going to be the Republican nominee, who's going to be the Democratic nominee, if you had to pick today?STEYN: Well, look, I -- I think going into Iowa and New Hampshire, lots more Republicans are going to fall by the wayside. Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina are not going to be one of them. The question is whether there's an establishment candidate, a senator or a governor -- I mean, all the governors left in the race are ancient history now, like George Pataki and Jim Gilmore -- but whether there is one of those figure strong enough to see off the Trump, Carson, Fiorina thing.And I think at this stage, that's very doubtful. You know, whatever you feel about Lindsey Graham -- I know you always roll your eyes when I mention him -- but he's actually very sincere about his issue, and he's going nowhere.The leading establishment candidates, like Jeb Bush, don't seem to be able to project any compelling reason as to why they're running for president. That was Scott Walker's problem.So they got to find a guy -- if they want to knock out Trump, they got to find an establishment guy who can be compelling, who can be passionate, who can be -- if you disagree with Trump on birthright citizenship and the border war and all the other stuff, you got to be able to do it with some passion and hammer him.Otherwise, right now, he's going to win Iowa and he's going to win New Hampshire, and after that, all bets are off and they'll be the ones wishing they hadn't signed the pledge.HANNITY: All right, Mark Steyn, thank you for being with us.Coming up -- Carly Fiorina surging in the polls. Can she keep this momentum going? Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich -- he weighs in on why the outsider candidates are connecting so well with you, the American people.Also, Frank Luntz is here tonight to explain which ads are now resonating best among you, the voters, and which ones are falling flat. That and more on this busy edition of ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: All right, welcome back to ""Hannity"" -- a little Deep Purple.Following a strong performance at last week's GOP debate, 2016 presidential candidate Carly Fiorina saw a pretty big spike in the polls. Earlier today, she sought to capitalize on that momentum at a foreign policy forum in Charleston, South Carolina.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FIORINA: It is interesting to me that the Obama administration has been roused to say something about Syrian refugees and asylum and taking more of them and has said virtually nothing about the persecution or crucifixion or mass exodus of Christians all across the Middle East!(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: We know that many of the people who come here are coming from terrorist-infested territories. We must ensure that we understand who's coming in and why and are they a threat to this country or not? But John Kerry and President Obama want to make a gesture, so they say 100,000, isn't this great? We don't have to deal with it. The next guy or gal will have to deal with it.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: And here with analysis, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to have you back. Welcome back, sir.NEWT GINGRICH, R-FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER: Great to be back with you. And that was a pretty compelling speech by Carly that you just had on just now. I mean, look at her -- look at her specifics, look at her delivery, look at how she draws a sharp contrast with the administration. You see why she's done well.HANNITY: I think she's performed very well in the debates. And I can tell you, having interviewed her, very meticulous in her preparation. She's informed. Her background and experience I think is far more extensive than people really know.Give me your general state of the GOP field, where it stands and where you think this is going.GINGRICH: Well, I've felt for a long time that you have to look at it in clusters. The top three people in the race are all non-office holders. You've got -- you've got Trump, now followed pretty closely by Fiorina, followed by Ben Carson. I mean, it's amazing to me over half the Republican voters are picking three people who have never held public office. It's almost like you show up and you say, Hi, I'm a senator or I'm a governor, and they check it off, OK, next, because it almost becomes a disadvantage to have held public office.And I think that reflects the degree to which the country's alienated from Washington. The remarkable numbers we're seeing in the Gallup poll -- for example, that 75 percent of the country believes there's widespread corruption in government -- that's breathtaking in terms of alienation.HANNITY: OK, so then let's walk through this together. Where does this end up? I mean, I saw you gave advice, for example, to Donald Trump to focus more on issues, less personal attacks. Is he still going to be the front-runner three months from now? Any advice you'd give him to maintain that position? Could either of those three be the nominee for the Republicans?GINGRICH: Oh, I think any of the three could be the nominee. I mean, first of all, these are three really smart people. I mean, no one should underestimate how smart Trump is. Fiorina proves every time she gets a chance that she really is an extraordinarily intelligent person with great clarity and great decisiveness. And remember, Ben Carson was the youngest head of a division at Johns Hopkins Hospital in the history of the hospital. He did brilliant world class neurosurgery on Siamese twins in his 30s, leading a 70-person operating team for 22 hours.These three people are remarkable in their general ability to learn, their general ability to master things, very different, but all three of them are remarkably smart.HANNITY: All right, then let's look outside of those three. And you've got Ted Cruz and Senator Rubio and John Kasich and Jeb Bush and -- and where do you see them fitting into this?GINGRICH: Well, I think, you know, there's almost a contest right now between -- and Cruz is kind of, by the way, the one guy who bridges both. He's in the Senate, but he's really not of the Senate. I mean, he's worked extra hard to make sure that he's an outsider in the Senate. So he's almost -- when I count votes, I count him as the fourth outsider, rather than...HANNITY: I agree, another insurgent candidate. Right.GINGRICH: So you have four insurgents. Then you have, I think, a competition, and we've seen good friends of ours, both of ours, people like Rick Perry and Scott Walker, drop out who are absolutely talented people. But this is not a year where that by itself is enough.So I think then you got a race between Jeb, who has enormous assets still, between Rubio, who is extraordinarily talented and gets very good remarks in every debate, and John Kasich who I think is probably the most innovative governor in the country.Those three guys really are in a contest over here for traditional candidate, if you will, somebody who's held office, operates within the traditional system, would manage it much better than Obama but is not a radical.HANNITY: Of all of those...GINGRICH: And over here, you have the four radicals.HANNITY: Of all of those, who do you see having the best chance at this moment to break through that other class of candidates?GINGRICH: Listen, if you had said to me a week ago, we'd be talking with Scott Walker no longer in the race...HANNITY: I would have been shocked. Yes. And he was a great governor, I agree with you. All right, let me ask this question.GINGRICH: All right.HANNITY: Republicans now are going to battle over a CR, the funding of Planned Parenthood. There's a group of Republicans that want to revisit the issue of the president's illegal, unconstitutional executive order on immigration, and some that even want to defund ""Obama care.""Why do I believe -- and even the refugee issue. Why do I believe that on every one of those issues, once President Obama says, I'll shut down the government, the Republican leadership will cave? Am I wrong?GINGRICH: Look, I think the Republican leadership has no faith in their ability to win a public relations fight with Barack Obama. I think they believe that the news media is so biased that they can't get their message through and they'll just lose the fight.HANNITY: So basically, surrender...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: We can expect another surrender. Isn't that fueling the insurgency rise?GINGRICH: Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, I did notice that Mitch McConnell wrote an article I think was in the Cincinnati newspaper in which he said there was going to be a way to defund Planned Parenthood. I want to see how he gets it done. I think there's an enormous burden -- McConnell has a harder job than Boehner because the Senate is a much harder institution to manage.HANNITY: What's so hard about this? You've done this! You actually -- you said no. And you stood strong! You paid a little price for it. Your approval rating went down a little bit. But they've never done this. They didn't do it on ""Obama care."" They didn't do it on immigration. Now they're going to do it on Planned Parenthood. And the base, conservatives like myself, sit back and say, Oh, they tell us it's a difference in tactics. Yes, I don't support the tactic of continually surrendering to Obama!GINGRICH: Well, look, I think this is a big problem. And I think it absolutely is part of why traditional candidates have a hard time right now because the Republican base is I think the angriest I've seen it since the Goldwater period.I mean, you now have -- when I go out and I talk to people who are major donors, they're just fed up. And so they're looking for candidates who ventilate in very aggressive language, people who talk about changing Washington, not managing Washington. There's a huge difference in those two.HANNITY: I got to ask you one question about the pope. You may not like it, but I'm going to ask it. The pope goes to Cuba. He meets the murdering dictator with all the political prisoners, the Castro brothers. He comes to the United States, and everything we hear, he's going to lecture America on the failures of capitalism. He's going to try and encourage us to open our borders on immigration, open our borders for refugees from Syria and Iraq, which I think is a bad idea. And he's going to talk about a nuclear ban.That is frustrating to me. What's your reaction as a Catholic?GINGRICH: Well, first of all, you've been spoiled by Pope John Paul II...HANNITY: That's correct.GINGRICH: ... who was a great, heroic figure who understood the modern world brilliantly and was intellectually decisive.Second, I'm an optimist. I think that Pope Francis is, in fact, attracting people to the church, starting dialogues, doing things that are useful. In Cuba, for example, he did exactly what John Paul II did and what Benedict did. They have a very clear sense -- if you can force a Castro dictatorship to allow a mass on the size that they were having, the number of people who are reconnected to the church today in Cuba is dramatically greater than it was two weeks ago.And I think it is a move in the direction of freedom. And I wrote a piece today for The Washington Times where I outlined -- you know, the pope talked very clearly about religious liberty in Cuba. I hope that the president and the Supreme Court and the Congress will listen to the Pope as closely when he talks about religious liberty, which they have been coercing. I mean, we're drifting towards an anti-religious secularism imposed by the state, enforced by putting people in jail, that I think is very dangerous. And I hope that that part of the Pope's message will also come through.HANNITY: All right, I suspect I'll have disagreements with him, but Mr. Speaker, thank you for being with us.GINGRICH: Good to be with you.HANNITY: When we come back, Frank Luntz is back to reveal which campaign is putting out the best political ads that resonate with you. And later more on the refugee crisis in the Middle East. We'll have a report from Greece where migrants are coming over by the boatload. And I go one on one with Geraldo Rivera. Should America be taking these people in? My position is no, straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Hi, Welcome back to HANNITY. So the road to 2016 is in full swing. And as we saw with Scott Walker exiting the race yesterday, some candidates' messages are resonating better with you, the voters. Pollster Frank Luntz recently dialed political ads with a focus group of voters. He's here to explain results. Mr. Luntz, good to see you, sir.FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER: It's great, Sean. I've got to tell you that already this series of ads are out, and it is significant that we've had some really good ads that have impacted Republican primary voters, but some of them have been awful and they just really haven't resonated.HANNITY: Let's look at Marco Rubio. He says if he's president our enemies will not test us. Let's see how this did.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The first thing that will change if I'm president is we're not going to have a foreign policy designed to make us popular in the world. We'll have a foreign policy designed to protect our people and make sure we're respected and our interests are respected in the world.For starters, we will rebuild our military and we will have for now and the foreseeable future the strongest military on this planet, and no one will dare test it. We will have a foreign policy of moral clarity that is clear whose side we're on. We're on the side of freedom and democracy and those who are willing to fight for their own freedom and democracy and liberty.And number three, we're going to have a foreign policy that makes it very clear that we are good to our allies. They can rely on us. And our enemies and adversaries will not dare test us because they will know that if they do, they will not prevail.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: You know what's fascinating is the longer he spoke, it kept going up and up and up. That's not always the case.LUNTZ: No. And Sean, this is an issue that people don't realize. Republican primary voters prioritize national security even above economic security. Foreign policy matters more to them than jobs and the economy. And Marco Rubio is one of the reasons why in the most recent polling he's now into double digits, that he is the one candidate that's talking about what needs to happen to restore American security.HANNITY: There's another candidate that says we need to be tougher with ISIS and Islamic terrorists that scored very well as well, and that's Senator Ted Cruz. Let's look at that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We will not defeat radical terrorists so long as we have a president unwilling to utter the words ""radical Islamic terrorism.""(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: What we need is a commander in chief who makes clear, if you join ISIS, if you wage jihad on America, then you are signing your death warrant.I introduced the expatriate terrorist act in the Senate that said if any American travels to the Middle East and joins ISIS, that he or she forfeits their citizenship so they don't use a passport to come back and wage jihad on Americans.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Almost the exact same phenomenon. That is not normally the case.LUNTZ: You're right. These are two of the best ads of the campaign season so far. Notice the different approach, that Ted Cruz is using a very direct -- he's using one of the most powerful sound bites yet spoken in this presidential campaign. Marco Rubio is more thoughtful and more philosophical. Ted Cruz is more passionate and in some ways more powerful, but they both get to the same point. My advice to Republican presidential candidates is that you better have a national security strategy and you better start talking about it now.HANNITY: All right, well said. Let's look on the other side of this. American Crossroads has an ad out against Hillary that goes after her and the e-mail server scandal. Let's watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I did not send classified material and I did not receive any material that was marked or designated classified. So that's all I can say.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you wipe the server?CLINTON: I have no idea. That's why we turned it over.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you wipe the server?CLINTON: Like with a cloth or something?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.CLINTON: I don't know. I don't know how it works digitally at all. I have no idea.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: ""You mean like with a cloth?"" That did not go over well. I would assume we're going to see a lot of that.LUNTZ: Yes. And in fact you're going to keep seeing Hillary's words -- Secretary of State Clinton's words used against her again and again. Sean, one of the things we found in our testing is that the more Hillary Clinton talks the more agitated people become simply because they don't believe she's telling the truth. And so crack a joke, wipe it with a cloth? That was Ed Henry questioning her. That -- by the way, Ed, of course a reporter at Fox News, that's questioning at its best. And it was very smart to use her own words against her. The public doesn't believe it any more.HANNITY: All right, Ben Carson, very soft spoken, he might even be described as the anti-Trump in the sense of his demeanor, personality, soft spoken, but he explains why he's running for president. Let's roll this one.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARSON: Our children, their future, nothing is more important. I'm Ben Carson. People ask, why run for president? Because our children face a very harsh future. Unsustainable debt future generations will suffer. At $10 million a day for 5,000 year, it still won't be repaid. Washington is broken. The political class broke it. Please join me, for their sake.I'm Ben Carson, and I approve this message.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Interesting, his tone and demeanor, while different, is still very acceptable to that group.LUNTZ: And it's more than acceptable. It's embraced. And it's the reason why Ben Carson --HANNITY: That's a better word. ""Embraced"" is a better word.LUNTZ: And -- but he goes into something that again I urge Republican candidates to pay attention to -- 55 percent of Americans believe that their children are going to have a worse quality of life than them. Sean, it's never been a majority in the last 50 years, but it is today, that feel that life is simply going to -- that their kids are going to suffer. And Ben Carson is focused on that in this campaign and it's one of the reasons why he's doing so well.HANNITY: We're going to have Frank back with Jeb and Trump and Carly in the next round. Appreciate it. Thank you, Frank Luntz.LUNTZ: Thank you.HANNITY: And coming up, we're going to go to Greece for an update on the refugee crisis. What happens to the migrants once they arrive in that country? Plus, should we be taking these migrants into America even though our intelligence agencies are warning us that in fact ISIS and Al Qaeda will infiltrate the refugee community? Geraldo and I go one on one next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" The staggering Middle East refugee crisis continues. Fox News foreign affairs correspondent Benjamin Hall is following a group of migrants as they arrive on the shores of Greece. Benjamin, What's it like on the ground?BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Sean, the island of Lesbos where we are now has become a symbol for the plight of refugees fleeing Middle Eastern conflict. This is the closest point between Turkey and Europe and it's the one land they so desperately want to reach. It may be the closest but it is also the most dangerous. And waters around this island have become a graveyard. Over the last week alone around 80 have died.But that danger doesn't stop refugees coming, and up to four-and-a- half thousand a day brave the choppy seas. We watched as boat after boat arrived at the shoreline fleeing the horrors behind them, the gas attacks and barrel bombs of Assad and the beheadings of ISIS. Ahead of them, though, lies a continent which is struggling to cope and which in some cases doesn't want them.This tragic journey is only possible due to a massive underground railroad, and human traffickers charge $1,500 for the one-hour journey, giving the desperate refugees a life jacket, putting them in a boat with a small motor and simply pointing them across the six-mile sea and letting them steer for themselves.But even here when they arrive their journey is just beginning. And once on the island the thousands sleep rough, before being fingerprinted, their I.D.'s checked, and they're given permission to leave. After that they're huddled into ferries and pushed from country to country until one will take them.That process is about to change, though, with European ministers voting today to set up a quota system which would redistribute refugees around the continent. Many Eastern European countries, though, are unhappy with this arrangement.The U.S. may also start to do more about this. Secretary of State John Kerry just announcing that the U.S. will raise its number from 70,000 immigrants to 85,000 this year, and then in 2017 it will take 100,000.Sean, all this ignores the fact that until the conflict in Syria is dealt with, the mass exodus of people, the largest since the Second World War, will continue to keep coming. And that is the problem, Sean.HANNITY: All right, Benjamin, thank you.Joining us now with reaction, Fox News senior correspondent Geraldo Rivera. You commented accurately so during Benjamin's report, we keep seeing in the media women and children, but the vast majority of the refugees are men.GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: That graphic, haunting picture of the three-year-old dead on the Turkish beach is what generated the international compassion and concern for this crisis. But the vast majority I would submit, and I think the statistics bear it out, of people fleeing -- just look at that lifeboat in the camera right, the vast majority of the people onboard that boat are young men. If they're Shiite they're fleeing being drafted into Bashar Assad's army, and if they're Sunni they're fearful that ISIS will get their hands on them.HANNITY: Here's the problem. James Clapper, the U.S. director of national intelligence, the State Department spokesman John Kirby, others in our intelligence community have all said the same thing -- ISIS and Al Qaeda will infiltrate the refugee community. So we're going to take in now upwards of close to 200,000. It's probably just the beginning of a number of people coming from an area we cannot ascertain what their intentions are for this country when they get here. To me, to risk taking in one ISIS fighter is too great a risk.RIVERA: Let me just give you a quick alternative, and then I'll address Mr. Clapper who I think is spot-on. First of all, why not have Russia and the United States work jointly to establish a safe zone within Syria? This is a zone where we have sufficient military prowess, where we can keep people reasonably. Not in Jordan, not in Lebanon, not anywhere else --HANNITY: Keep them where they are.RIVERA: In Syria. Let all the aid come to them. We protect them against ISIS. We protect them against Islamic terrorists.HANNITY: By the way, Putin and Netanyahu, Netanyahu met with Putin this week. That would be a perfect coalition. That's a great idea.RIVERA: It is absolutely the way to do it.Now to the importation of the misery to the United States. I think it is a curious exchange of misery, what the president proposes. Even as he's now suggesting almost a quarter of a million immigrants coming from Syria, we are expelling from this country millions of undocumented, law abiding Mexicans who have been here for decades.HANNITY: We're not doing that, but OK.RIVERA: This has happened before. In 2008 they were in the meat packing plant in Iowa where the Mexicans have been working for decades. They got all deported in 2008. Who took their place? We imported tens of thousands of refugees from Somalia, Sunni Muslims from Somalia fleeing the violence there. Those Somalis they took the jobs of the Mexicans in Iowa. Now they've settled in the twin cities. What happened? At least 40 of the Somali refugees have returned to Africa to fight for al-Shabaab, the Al Qaeda affiliate in Africa. It is fraught with peril. You import a young man from the war zones and you are almost guaranteeing that some percentage, maybe a small percentage, but Clapper is right some percentage will turn bad.HANNITY: Even if it's two or three percent, we can't risk it. But the president is willing to risk it.RIVERA: But this is the way. Why not this safe zone? It would be cheaper.HANNITY: I never thought I'd say these words -- Geraldo, you're 1,000 percent correct. We can get Putin, we can get Netanyahu. We can get Egypt, we can get Jordan, we can get the Saudis --RIVERA: Everyone.HANNITY: Everyone should unite to keep them there.RIVERA: Now this is true free Syria, not in Damascus, not in Aleppo, not in Raqqa where ISIS is.HANNITY: Not take them here, we should not take one.RIVERA: Well, babies, mothers, children.HANNITY: Don't you remember what you said to me during hurricane Katrina, ""Sean, the babies."" You have a soft spot for kids.RIVERA: I do.HANNITY: I can't fault you on that front. Geraldo, you're right. Great point.RIVERA: Thank you.HANNITY: Coming up next, we need your help. Our ""Question of the Day."" And we're bringing back our segment video edition of ""Ask Sean."" That's straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to HANNITY. Time for tonight's ""Question of the Day."" Who do you think benefits from Scott Walker exiting the race? We want to hear from you. Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, and on Twitter @SeanHannity, let us know what you think.Now, we told you last night we're bringing back the segment ""Ask Sean"", me. You've been sending in questions on Facebook and Twitter that you'd like to ask me. Here is tonight's question. Apparently it's coming from Estonia. Let's listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sean, I'm a big fan of yours. And my question comes from Europe, from Estonia. And I was wondering, have you ever thought about running for president, perhaps in the future? Thank you. Bless you.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: First, I'm honored that you're watching in Estonia. Thank you very much. We really appreciate it. I have not given much thought to running for political office. I'd like to at least facilitate. I view conservatives as we're all spokes of the wheel. And I do radio and TV every day to try to and out a good, strong, solid conservative message with conservative solutions. And my hope is that we all together as spokes in a wheel that we can get this country on the right track. Running for president, I don't think my own family would vote for me. But thank you for your vote of confidence.If you have a question for me, go over to Twitter and use the #AskSean, or, even better, send in a video and we might put your face on TV and you'll be a big star in your family.That's all the time we have. Don't forget, set your DVR so you never miss an episode. We take attendance. We're angry when you're not here. We'll see you back here tomorrow night.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
