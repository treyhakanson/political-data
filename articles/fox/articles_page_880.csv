This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Chris Wallace.  Explosive leaks just before the second presidential debate.  More hacked e-mails that show what Hillary Clinton really told those big bankers.  And Donald Trump apologizing after release of a tape of him making lewd remarks about women.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I moved on her and I failed.  I'll admit it.  I did try and (EXPLETIVE DELETED) her.  She was married.WALLACE:  Now, some top Republicans are jumping ship.  SEN. MIKE LEE, R-UTAH:  I respectfully ask you, with all due respect, just step aside, step down.  REP. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  There is a bit of an elephant in the room and it is a troubling situation.  And I'm serious, it is.  WALLACE:  We'll discuss whether Trump can recover, with top adviser Rudy Giuliani.  RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER NYC MAYOR:  He's in the race to win and he is going to win.  WALLACE:  Then, hacked e-mails show Clinton was telling bankers something very different from what she was telling voters.  We'll ask John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman, about the stark contradictions between what she was saying in public and private.  It's a ""Fox News Sunday"" exclusive.  And we'll ask our Sunday panel after the leak of that recording, will the GOP dump Trump?  Plus, a conversation with Bill O'Reilly about the election and media bias.  BILL O'REILLY, FOX NEWS ANCHOR, ""THE O'REILLY FACTOR"":  The prevailing wisdom in Washington, as you know, and in New York City is that we journalists know better than everybody.  WALLACE:  All, right now, on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  And hello again from Fox News in Washington.  We begin with the latest on Hurricane Matthew.  The deadly storm is now a post-tropical cyclone with sustained winds of 75 miles per hour.  The storm's track shows it over eastern North Carolina, heading into the Atlantic.  Matthew has dumped more than a foot of rain on the coastal Carolinas.  More than a million people have been left without power.  The storm is blamed for at least ten deaths in the U.S.  We'll have much more on Matthew later in the hour.  Now to latest political storms with both campaigns in full damage control.  Donald Trump's lewd talk about women is sending shock waves through the Republican Party.  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is dealing with the revelation of what she told bankers in those big-money speeches.  And we're just hours from the second presidential debate tonight in St.  Louis.  In a moment, we'll speak with John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman.  But, first, live from Trump Tower, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a top adviser to the campaign.  Mayor, let's start with the tape of Trump talking to ""Access Hollywood's"" Billy Bush back in 2005.  He brags about hitting on a married woman and then says this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  I'm automatically attracted to beautiful -- it's like a magnet.  I don't even -- and when you're a star, they let you do it.  You can do anything.  BILLY BUSH:  Whatever you want.  TRUMP:  Grab them by the (EXPLETIVE DELETED).  You can do anything.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Mayor Giuliani, we had booked Kellyanne Conway, the campaign manager, but late last night, the campaign pulled her and said that you're going to be our guest.  We're always happy to have you.  But I got to ask you, was Kellyanne Conway unwilling to defend Trump's remarks about women?  GIULIANI:  Well, I don't think anyone is going to defend his remarks.  Is Kellyanne still a very strong supporter of Donald Trump and does she believe he'd make a better president than Hillary Clinton?  Absolutely, yes.  So, I think this is a question of scheduling and not being willing to explain.  I'm not here to defend his comments.  If he were here, he wouldn't be defending his comments.  His comments were wrong.  They were very wrong, and reprehensible.  He's said that and apologized for it.  And I think what you're looking at is a man who's gone through 14 months of running for president, understands the weight on his shoulder of all of these people who voted for him, who believe in him, who believe he's -- really has a movement to try to change this country.  They have outsiders kind of taking it back from the insiders who have been running it and in many cases ruining for quite some time.  So, I think the point that we make is, he has apologized for this, and we believe if you get to the issues, he's the candidate that is much better suited to run the country than Hillary Clinton, who has her own set of flaws.  (CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  We're going to get to those in a moment, but I want to stay on --GIULIANI:  I know you are.  WALLACE:  -- on Donald Trump.  Around midnight on Friday, Trump put out a statement apologizing for his comments.  Here's a clip of that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  I've said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them.  Anyone who knows me knows these words don't reflect who I am.  I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Trump says, ""The words don't reflect who I am.""  But, Mayor, there's a long history of Trump making aggressive moves on women.  He's been sued for sexual harassment, and there are decades of insults of women.  Don't these words reflect exactly who he is?  GIULIANI:  No, they don't.  I know Donald Trump for almost 30 years.  Doesn't reflect the man that I know.  I've had many conversations with him.  I may have had a conversation like that with him.  I know a man who's been a wonderful father, who's brought up remarkable children, including two wonderful daughters and three granddaughters.  He's always dealt -- in my time with him -- he's always dealt with women with great respect.  He's been a gentleman.  So, are there things he's done wrong during that period of time or things that he said wrong that he wishes he didn't?  I'm sure there are.  The reality is he also has gone through something that is transformational in a person's life, a presidential campaign.  He's gone through 14 months of being out there, hearing what people are worried about and afraid of -- afraid of losing their jobs, having lost their jobs, jobs being moved from Ohio to Mexico or from Michigan to Mexico or from Pennsylvania to China.  People who were worried they're going to be completely out of work like the coal miners that Hillary Clinton says are all going to be fired and all going to be gone.  So, these things weigh on you as a person.  I went through it.  And they make you a lot more serious and they literally make you into a different kind of person.  I think September 11 and running for president made me into a different person.  WALLACE:  Sir, I don't mean to interrupt.  I want to the get to a couple other issues.  I know you want to talk about the hacked e-mails.  One more question about Trump, though, because there has been a storm of criticism inside the GOP against Trump, and some people are now calling for him to drop out.  Let's put up some of the reaction.  Dozens of GOP leaders have abandoned him.  House Speaker Paul Ryan said, ""I am sickened by what I heard today.""  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, ""These comments are repugnant and unacceptable in any circumstance.""  Congressman Jason Chaffetz, ""I'm out, I'm pulling my endorsement.""  And Congresswoman Martha Roby, ""The best thing for our country and our party is for Trump to step aside.""Now, I know you say, well, that's the elite or that's the establishment.  There are a lot of people who were Trump supporters who have had enough.  I guess my question is, if the GOP, if leaders were to come to Donald Trump this week and say, for the good of the party, to save the GOP majorities in the House and in the Senate, you've got to step down.  What will he do?  GIULIANI:  Donald Trump is running for president.  He was selected -- many of those people are good friends of mine.  In fact, I think they all are.  And their opinion is given a great deal of weight and consideration.  He has.But he was selected by, you know, millions and millions of Republicans who still very much believe in him, who I think are more willing to forgive, maybe, than some others, and more willing to realize that this is a different man today than the man that was reflected in those comments.  This is a man who has a very heavy weight on his shoulders of having to determine the future of the Supreme Court, having to deal with the rising crime that last year was the largest number of murders, increase in the last 40 --  WALLACE:  Mayor --  GIULIANI:  -- 40, 41 years.  So, that's what I would say.  I would say he would listen to them, but I believe he's going to remain in the race.  In fact, I know he is.  WALLACE:  Finally, let's turn to the hacked e-mails of John Podesta, which indicate that Hillary Clinton was saying something very different from what she said on the campaign trail when she was talking in those big money, closed door speeches to Wall Street bankers.  She says her dream is open trade and open borders across the western hemisphere.  She says the people on Wall Street know best how to regulate Wall Street, and she says she is far removed from the struggles of the middle class because of the fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy.  (LAUGHTER)WALLACE:  Your reaction?  GIULIANI:  Well -- and she also pointed out, I think, in one of them that she's a different person to them than she is -- she has to be different politically.  So, we have two Hillary Clintons, which says we have a person who's a liar.  Chris, that's what she is.  I mean, over and over again.  I can go through her 302s and Martha Stewart was prosecuted for one lie, I could have prosecuted her for 10, like she didn't know that ""C"" meant confidential.  Come on, Hillary.  You know, you can put that one over on somebody but not me.  So, we've got two candidates that have flaws.  Now, let's get to the issues.  Who are going to be better on the issues?  And I do think one of the really horrible things about that is had those come out, Bernie Sanders would be the candidate now that we'd be running against, not her, because she fought so hard to keep those secret.  We now know why, because if she had run the way she ran on those tapes for all those bankers, for all that -- I mean, she got paid millions of dollars for saying that stuff.  WALLACE:  Mayor Giuliani --  GIULIANI:  She got paid for it.  She would not be the candidate.  WALLACE:  Mayor Giuliani, we're going to have to cut it short.  We thank you.  Thanks for your time today, sir.  GIULIANI:  Thank you.  WALLACE:  Hillary Clinton goes into tonight's debate hauling her own baggage.  Hacked e-mails now reveal what Clinton was telling Wall Street bankers and big money speeches behind closed doors.  Transcripts she refused to make public.  Joining me now only on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.John, I promise we'll get to the Trump tape in a moment.  But, first, we need to talk about these hacked e-mails from your private account.  To go back in time, let's hear what Hillary Clinton was telling voters in New Hampshire last February.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Anybody who knows me who thinks that they can influence me, name anything they've influenced me on.  Just name one thing.  I'm out here every day saying I'm going to shut them down, I'm going after them, I'm going to jail them if they should be jailed, I'm going to break them up.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  But here's what Clinton told bankers about regulation at one of those Goldman Sachs speeches: ""How do you get to the golden key?  How do we figure out what works?  And the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.""So, John, what's her real view?  Crack down on big money or kiss up to them?  JOHN PODESTA, HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGER:  Well, Chris, I think we should take a step back and say how we got here, which is that the Russians, as U.S. senior members of the U.S. government confirmed, have been hacking into Democratic accounts, and now, they've hacked into my account.  They've put out documents purported to be from my account.But I think if you look at what she said in this campaign, to get to your question -- I would just say, you know, this should be of concern to everyone that the Russians are trying to influence our election.  But I'll answer your question directly, which is as she said all throughout this campaign, she'll crack down on Wall Street.  She said it, too, there's nothing that she hasn't said in private that she doesn't say in public.  She's put forward the most aggressive Wall Street plan of any candidate, really.  She stands behind Dodd/Frank.  Donald Trump wants to rip it away.  She won't let Wall Street --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  But, John, what are we to make of the fact she says in private that the people who know the industry best in terms of regulation are the people who work on Wall Street?  PODESTA:  That's hardly -- that's hardly a revelation.  I mean, I think people on Wall Street know how to game the system.  What she wants to do is crack down on the system, make sure that there's no institution that's too big to fail and there's no person that's too big to jail.  So, I think she's put forward very comprehensive ideas about that, how to reduce the size of big banks, and that's why Bernie Sanders yesterday after looking at those transcripts said that he stands behind her.  What they worked together to produce on the Democratic platform.  That's what she'll do as president of the United States.  (CROSSTALK)PODESTA:  There's nothing exceptional in there.  WALLACE:  Well, the question -- it's like what Donald Trump says.  He's the one to handle the tax system because he knows how to game it.  Let me ask you about another one.  During the campaign, Clinton has taken a tough line on both trade and on immigration.  But here's what she said in a big money speech to a Brazilian bank, ""My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.  Just think of what doubling the trade between the United States and Latin America would mean for everybody in this room.""John, open trade, open borders?  PODESTA:  Look, you could pluck a few words if that's what she did say out of context.  I think, again, she's put forward and has been for and has constantly, you know, championed and voted for comprehensive immigration reform that modernizes our border security.  She -- when she was secretary of state, she talked about creating a hemispheric effort to bring clean energy across the continent from the tip of South America to Canada, to invest in clean and renewable energy, to invest in the transmission that would clean up our energy system.  And, you know, I think that she's constantly talked about that.  She had an initiative when she was secretary of state to do that.  So, you got to look at the context of some of these remarks.WALLACE:  But, John, this goes --  PODESTA:  And I think when you look at what she said about immigration, she's for comprehensive immigration reform that takes people out of the shadows, emphasizes family unity, but also has -- modernizes our border security.  WALLACE:  But, John, this gets to the heart --(CROSSTALK)PODESTA:  So, you can take a word here and a word there --WALLACE:  This gets to the heart of people's concerns about Hillary Clinton.  I want to take an excerpt from another one of her speeches.  As she said, ""You need both a public and a private position.""  The question is, when you see the speeches and then you see what she's saying on the campaign, and sometimes they're diametrically opposed, what's her real position?  PODESTA:  They're not diametrically opposed, Chris.  She talked about income inequality to Wall Street.  She said we need to close the carried interest loophole.  She said to them that even as early as 2008 that what they were doing with credit default swaps and the housing market was going to wreck the economy, which it did.  She's been tough with them when she was a senator from New York.  That's when she's done.  They're not diametrically opposed.  Again, you can pull a few words out of context, but what he said on this campaign trail was she will be tough on Wall Street.  And that's exactly what she'll do.  WALLACE:  All right.  We've got a little bit of time remaining.  You've been very patient.  Your reaction to the Trump tape?  PODESTA:  Well, my reaction is it's disgusting.  And I think people saw in real life what we've been saying for our long time, what Hillary said as far back as June, is that he's unfit to be president of the United States.  You see Republicans leaving him in droves.  There are now 46 senior Republicans who said that he should either withdraw or they won't vote for him just since Friday.  So I think he'll have some explaining himself to do tonight.  But, you know, this isn't an exception.  He's said the same horrible things about Latinos, about African-Americans, about Muslims.  He's made fun of a reporter with disabilities.  You know, this is who this guy is.  And I think that the American people just heard and saw for themselves in some graphic detail which, you know, I hope every voter actually takes the time to see what is really on that tape.  I hope all of their children don't get to see what's on that tape.  WALLACE:  John Podesta -- John, thank you.  Thanks for joining us today.  Of course, we'll all be watching what happens in tonight's debate.  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the explosive reaction to Trump's crude remarks, with some top Republicans now calling on him to drop out of the race.  Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the impact of the Trump tape?  Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  I moved on her, actually.  You know, she was down in Palm Beach.  I'll admit it.  Let's be honest.  We're living in the real world.  This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we're facing today.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Donald Trump apologizing and trying to turn the page after that leaked tape from 2005 showed him in a crude conversation about women.  And it's time now for our Sunday group.  GOP strategist Karl Rove, Fox News political analyst Juan Williams, New York Times columnist, Maureen Dowd, author of ""The Year of Voting Dangerously"" -- and, boy, is it?  And Jason Riley of the Wall Street Journal.Well, Karl, let me start with you.  And the rules of the Republican Party -- Trump says he's not dropping out, and apparently it's almost impossible.  Maybe you'll tell me I'm wrong, for them to force him out.  I know that the House GOP is going to have a conference call tomorrow morning to discuss all of this.  How seriously is the idea of trying to find some way either by force or persuasion to get Donald Trump to drop out?  KARL ROVE, FORMER WHITE HOUSE ADVISOR:  Well, first of all, there are two steps to this.  They can't force him out, but they could declare him somehow ineligible, but realistically, the Republican National Committee can't replace him unless he withdraws.  Then, members of the national committee could replace him.  But let's be realistic.  The second problem is the states.  We're already voting in more than a dozen states, accepting absentee ballots applications in several dozens more.  I mean, there are ballots prepared in virtually I would suspect every state.  And it's going to be impossible, virtually impossible, to replace Donald Trump if he were to decide to resign on most state ballots.  WALLACE:  Is this being talked about seriously in Republican circles?  Because you have dozens of GOP leaders, members of Congress, members of the Senate, talking about him, that he should step down.  ROVE:  Well, I wrote about this in may when we were contemplating the problem for Hillary Clinton being indicted after the Democratic convention.  Let me just tell you, I'm not a lawyer, but after talking to a lot of lawyers, it's virtually impossible to replace somebody in August, let alone in October.  And if he were to decide to do it, it would take a week or so to get the national committee together to arrive at this.  So, we're talking about literally two or three weeks before the election.  At that point, virtually every state is sending out absentee ballots or having early voting or both.  WALLACE:  Maureen, I'm sitting reading my New York Times on Saturday morning.  Lead story, The F bomb --  MAUREEN DOWD, NEW YORK TIMES:  Yes.WALLACE:  -- explicit descriptions of women's anatomy.  These are quotes from Donald Trump.  I also see the paper in the front page also says, ""All the news that's fit to print.""  I got to say, I have two questions.  One, what has happened to the Gray Lady, as ""The Times"" is called?  And is this all just a promotion for your new book?  (LAUGHTER)DOWD:  Yes.  Chris, I think that Trump's lasting legacy, aside from throwing the Republican Party, will be changing The New York Times in these profound ways where for the first time we've changed our policy and we call politicians liars and presidential candidates liars, which we never did.  I was always having to look up synonyms when I was writing about Dick Cheney.  And now, we've changed the policy again to use these kind of smutty words.  So, thank you, Donald Trump.  WALLACE:  A contribution to the legacy of The Times and our culture.  DOWD:  Right.WALLACE:  We asked you for questions for the panel.  And we got a bunch, and sharply divided opinions about the Trump tape.  Michelle Foyles Nash sent this on Facebook, ""All men say things to each other they wouldn't want anyone else to hear.  Get on with the real problems of the country.""But Melinda Steinhouse writes, ""I have been a supporter of Trump, but I think unfortunately in light of these comments, he should step down.  The GOP needs to nominate pence for president.  There is too much at stake with the Supreme Court.""Jason, look, let's be honest.  Trump's crude comments about women are nothing new.  We've -- I guess the question I have is, why is this tipping point?  Why is this the point at which a lot of people, particularly Republican officials, are saying, that's it?  JASON RILEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Well, I think partly this is self-preservation.  I think there's a lot of pessimism about Trump's chances in November.  You see party officials saying, we've got to count on split ticket voters to help us hang on to the Senate, maybe distancing ourselves from Trump will help us do that.  I think there's also just a bit of exhaustion that has set in here, in trying to defend all the things he's said over the years.  I mean, some of us stopped or never did it in the first place.  Others were waiting for him to turn it around, to grow up, to become more presidential.  And now, they said, you know what, it hasn't happened in the first 70 years of his life, I don't think it's going to happen in the next 30 days, and they're done with him.  WALLACE:  What do you think about this idea of him dropping out?  Not that the replacement would necessarily be able to beat Clinton, as we talked about all the ballots, but it might save the House -- the Republican House and the Republican Senate.  RILEY:  There is -- that's one scenario.  But another scenario and a scary one if you're one of these Republican officials, is Donald Trump not going quietly and saying to his supporters, I told you the system was rigged.  Now take it out on the GOP up and down the ballot.  That's a risk.  WALLACE:  You know, all this is playing out as we should point out, almost like a movie.  Almost like a Maureen Dowd book, hours before the second presidential debate.  I guess the question, Juan, is there anything you could see with Rudy Giuliani not combative, very regretful of what he had said, remorseful, and saying, but let's get to the issues.Is there anything Trump can do tonight to take some of the sting out of this?  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, I think the first thing he's got to do -- actually, there's three risky strategies I can envision, Chris.  One, ignore it -- which I think is what Rudy Giuliani was trying to say.  It's a nonissue, the man apologized.  And then, secondly, saying it's being overplayed by my opponent, who are leaking this material.  Maybe it was the mainstream press is out to get me putting this stuff out and there's more to come and all that.  And then get back to the idea that he's the great disrupter, that he's here to disrupt American politics.  The status quo is unacceptable, Hillary Clinton is unacceptable.  The third possibility, which may be the riskiest, is to go after Bill Clinton.  We saw this in one of his apologies where he said, I heard worse on the golf course from Bill Clinton.  What if he goes directly at Clinton and that the idea that Mrs. Clinton has been part of the team that disparage women who are involved with his husband, what happens then?  How does Hillary Clinton respond?  How does this audience -- remember, it's a town hall -- how did the individuals respond?  I think that's a very risky strategy, given that we know not only about the tape but Miss Universe, the things he's said about Megyn Kelly and the rest.  It would really, I think, be an explosion.  WALLACE:  Karl, we got about a minute left in this segment.  You've advised politicians.  You've been in this spot hours before a debate -- obviously never quite --  (CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  -- this situation.  (LAUGHTER)WALLACE:  But you're sitting there.  You're the senior adviser to Donald Trump.  What would you say?  ROVE:  We saw it in Rudy Giuliani.  Only sincere words of contrition will allow him to begin to salvage this, to say it is -- this issue is bigger than him, this experience of running for president has taught him the enormous responsibility that he bears as the spokesman for this movement, and try and refocus it on the big issues.  But it's going to have to be sincere and honest.  Everyone is going to judge that.  That tape at 12:00 a.m., you know --WALLACE:  The apology.  ROVE:  The Saturday morning apology tape, that didn't come across as sincere.  That came across as combative.  It needs to be sincere contrition.  Even then, it's going to be hard.  He had a narrow window to win.  I think that narrow window is closing because it's very difficult to attract swing voters.  WALLACE:  Real quickly, if he were to do option three of Brother Williams over here and go after the Clinton?  ROVE:  A mistake, because what he simply says is, I'm just as bad as he is, and he's just as bad as me.  But his name is not on the ballot, that name Bill Clinton.   It's Hillary Clinton.  And she can simply say -- not on the ballot.And let's remember this.  This is probably not the last or the worst oppo dump that the Clinton campaign has to go.  He needs to set up for what's coming down the road by saying, ""You know what, I'm a changed man.  I changed in the last decade, but I've been particularly change by the events in the last 14 months.  I get it.  You're asking me to change America.  Keep America from being transformed in front of your eyes.  I will do that and I'll take it serious.""WALLACE:  All right, panel.  We have to take a break.  But coming up, Hillary Clinton faces her own problems -- hacked e-mails that show her taking very different positions on trade, borders, and Wall Street in big money speeches to bankers than what she's telling voters.  That's next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  Coming up, one on one with Bill O'Reilly about the campaign and tonight's debate.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL O'REILLY, FOX NEWS ANCHOR, THE O'REILLY FACTOR:  Trump has got to be feisty but not mean.  You know, he should have those two words -- feisty but not mean.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  O'Reilly on politics, media bias, his new book, and possible retirement.  That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Trump was taking from America with both hands and leaving the rest of us with the bill.  TRUMP:  Her only method of making money is by selling government favors and granting access to special interests.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Those are the kind of issues we thought Trump and Clinton would be talking about in tonight's debate before the explosive leaks of his tape about women and her speeches to Wall Street.  We're back now with the panel.  Well, Maureen, we finally got to see what Hillary Clinton was hiding in the transcripts of those big money, closed-door speeches to Wall Street -- talked about open borders, open trade, that the people who know best how to regulate Wall Street are the people who work on Wall Street.How damaging to Clinton with just four weeks to go in this campaign?  MAUREEN DOWN, COLUMNIST, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  I think it would have been lethal during the primaries, but now not so much because, you know, in many ways, she is the GOP candidate.  She's the one who cuddles up to hedge funds, and she's the shill of Wall Street.  So, it's only what we already knew.  WALLACE:  But what about the argument that this speaks to, you know, whether you like the policy or don't like the policy, that she's not honest and she's not trustworthy?  DOWD:  Well, wow.  So Hillary Clinton will do and say anything to win.  That's not a surprise.  And as usual, Donald Trump drags all his Acme dynamite to the center of the stage and blows it up so that no one can pay attention to anything bad about Hillary.  WALLACE:  A good reference to the Road Runner cartoon, for those who may have missed it.  Jason, there was also a passage in one of her big money speeches in which Clinton invokes Lincoln fighting for the 13th Amendment to abolish slavery and saying, you need both a public and a private position.  This goes to the core, as I was talking to Maureen, about what people don't trust about this woman.  JASON RILEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  It does.  She talks out of both sides of her mouth, depending on the audience in front of her.  But again, in the primary -- I think Maureen is right.  In the primary, this would have been much more damaging.  It may still do some damage to those millennial voters who she lost because they don't trust the establishment candidates because they talk out of both sides of their mouth.  But again, I think now that we've moved to the general election, and particularly since there are still so many disaffected Republican moderates who can't stomach Donald Trump, listening to her talk about trade, immigration, denouncing Edward Snowden, I think that might work to her advantage, actually.  What strikes me, really, is still what she charges for these speeches more than what she said.  The way that the Clintons have traded on their public service to enrich themselves, more than $20 million for these speeches over a couple years.  That still boggles the mind.  WALLACE:  Juan, your thoughts about Hillary Clinton's speeches, what we learned about them in these hacked e-mails?  WILLIAMS:  Well, I don't think it changes anybody's view.  I think I'm just reiterating what we've heard from Jason and Maureen here, because I think people hearing this say she's the one who said TPP, the current trade deal, is the gold standard before she changed.  But she changed in the middle of the primary campaign and to that extent has adjusted to the Bernie Sanders followers and to the Democratic Party base in terms of being more restrictive in terms of trade deals.  WALLACE:  But I guess what I'm asking is this, we knew that Donald Trump said lewd things about women, and yet somehow this tape seems to be a game changer.  We knew that Hillary Clinton had played double games on a lot of these issues, but somehow you don't seem to think that these triple transcripts are a game changer.  Why not?  WILLIAMS:  I don't think it has the same impact.  In the case of Trump, you're right -- I mean, clearly, he had a long history of saying offensive things about women.  I could go on, offensive things about blacks, Mexicans, disabled or not.  But I think in this case, what you're seeing at this moment in the campaign is a specific group of undecided voters that's going to decide this thing.  I think in large part, it's suburban white women who lean to the right.  And where are those women at this moment?  I don't think they're going to be impacted by what came out from the Clinton tapes or whatever, but they are impacted when they hear Donald Trump's language because it's highly offensive.  I mean, it's not -- you know, look, I grew up playing sports.  I've been in a lot of locker rooms, Chris.  I hear men say I would like that woman or she's a hot woman.  I've never heard anybody say something as graphic and hostile as what came out in that tape.  RILEY:  Which is another reason why making the debate referendum on the Clinton marriage could backfire.  How is this going to help him with that demographic?  WILLIAMS:  I don't think it helps him though.WALLACE:  Karl, any way that Trump can make these hacked e-mails and the question of her honesty and trustworthiness if not as big as the tape, a memorable issue in this debate?  ROVE:  Well, he can't make them as big because sex trumps money.  Her quotes are about money.  His is about sex.  So, you can't trump that.  But what -- another thing is this is obscuring a second set of scandals that are worth bringing up, came out this past week that two of her aides were given immunity in the investigation of her e-mail server, and laptops were destroyed as part of that immunity agreement after the government took a look at them.  It also turns out that Cheryl Mills has now got an official complaint with the lawyers -- with the group that regulates lawyers in the District of Columbia for violating, quote, ""the absolute disqualification if you participated personally or substantially in the issue at question.""  So, she was representing Hillary Clinton at the same time she was a subject of the FBI investigation.  So, this all gets obscured.  He's got to -- if he's going to salvage anything, even his own dignity out of this, it needs to be an honest, sincere contrition and then pivot to the big issues.  I'm not even certain these WikiLeak tapes are as important as -- they're important only to the degree that they help him raise the bigger issue of your status quo, you're more of the same, I'm change.  WALLACE:  I want to take this to the 30,000 view -- 30,000-foot view, Maureen.  Will this campaign -- and I suppose at this point it's kind of a rhetorical question -- will it ever be about issues, or is it just right through Election Day about these two outsized personalities?  DOWD:  No, Chris, it's not.  (LAUGHTER)WALLACE:  We're not going to have a serious conversation?  DOWD:  No, we're heading to the inevitable end of this, which is the mad German king locked in his castle on Fifth Avenue.  (LAUGHTER)WALLACE:  Wow.  ROVE:  I disagree.  I think at the end of the day, voters will make up their minds on the basis, of do they think she's reasonable change, or is he change and she's status quo?  At the end, that group that's sitting there, they knew all these bad things about him and all these bad things about her.  I think at some point, they're going to say, I'm going to set these things aside for a moment and make a critical decision about whose vision is better for me at the end.  DOWD:  But untrustworthy and paranoid beats unstable and piggish.  ROVE:  Could be.  (LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS:  I think -- I think a lot of people -- and I think we're going to see this tonight at the debate, Chris.  People are interested in, what are you going to do for me.  How do you help me?  In a sense, the audience is going to be asking less about scandal and more about, well, what is it that in your policy would allow me to prosper and my children to get a good education in America?And I think because of that, and because of her experience in doing town halls, Clinton has a big advantage in showing empathy and understanding.  Trump is still on his heels, in boxing terms, still against the ropes.  WALLACE:  But I was going to say, though -- Jason, the one advantage Trump has, people want change and they think we're on the wrong track.  RILEY:  They do want change, but, you know, 30 days before an election, we're still talking about the Republican nominee's fitness for office. Not about the changes he would bring to the job in term of policy.  WALLACE:  So, can he -- in ten seconds, can he change the conversation tonight?  RILEY:  It's going to be very difficult for him to do that, I think, tonight.  WALLACE:  All right.  Thank you, panel.  See you next Sunday.  We'll all watch the debate tonight.  Up next, Bill O'Reilly on tonight's debate, media bias and how long he'll keep doing ""The Factor.""  You don't want to miss it.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  A look outside the beltway at Washington University in St. Louis, site of tonight's second presidential debate.  Earlier this week, before the Friday bombshells, I sat down with my colleague Bill O'Reilly, author of the new book ""Killing the Rising Sun."" And as you'll see, we talked about all sorts of things.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  Bill, welcome to ""FOX News Sunday.""O'REILLY:  Thank you.  Nice to be here.  WALLACE:  The second presidential debate tonight, what does Trump need to do, what does Clinton need to do?  O'REILLY:  Well, Trump has got to be feisty but not mean.  You know, he should have those two words, feisty but not mean, because the folks are going to be surrounding him.  It's different than the other debate.  You have that town hall thing.  WALLACE:  Real people.  O'REILLY:  Yes, so it's a different kind of dynamic than when you're talking to a camera than when you're talking to a human being.  So, he's got to show some charm and some personality, but he's got to be tough.  WALLACE:  And Clinton?  O'REILLY:  You know, she'll be the same that she always is.  You don't see a lot of looks from Hillary Clinton.  She's got her rap down.  She'll come across as the concerned person who will fix your life.  That's what she does.  WALLACE:  You have known Trump for 30 years.  When you see him in the debate, when you read about him tweeting in the middle of the night, does he know enough to be president, does he have the right temperament to be president?  O'REILLY:  You know, does he know enough?  That is a purely subjective point of view because I don't think any human being knows enough to be president.  It's who you surround yourself with, how much studying you're willing to do, how much research you're willing to do.Temperament -- he's an impulsive man, Trump.  He reacts emotionally.  And so, when you're president, it's different than when you're campaigning because you would feel he would be wall off a little bit in the White House.  You know how that goes.  You're not alone with anybody.  They'll take his machines away from him in the middle of the night.  Secret Service is always there.  But on the campaign, he's been a little too impulsive, a little bit too emotional.  WALLACE:  I want to talk to you about media bias, which I know is a subject that you are interested in.  Rudy Giuliani went on the Sunday shows this last week, and he was asked about Trump attacking the Clinton's marriage.  And here's how he was treated.  Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHUCK TODD, MEET THE PRESS:  Are you the right person to level this charge?  RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER NYC MAYOR:  Yes, I'm the right person to level this charge because they made such a charge and I've prosecuted people who committed rape.  TODD:  But your past, you have your own infidelities.  GIULIANI:  Everybody does and I -- you know, I'm a Roman Catholic.  I confess those things to my priest.  But I think the accusations are about Hillary Clinton taking money from countries --JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR:  The accusation was Hillary Clinton was cheating on Bill.  That was the accusation was.  It was an unhinged and wild accusation.  I can understand why you can't defend it because it's indefensible.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Now, you said that Chuck Todd should apologize to Giuliani.O'REILLY:  Absolutely.WALLACE:  I thought Tapper was even worse.What's going on here?  O'REILLY:  Well, I don't like the personal stuff.  I think Todd sandbagged him, Giuliani, the mayor, because he knew he was going to ask him that question.  And that's not right.  The prevailing wisdom in Washington, as you know, and in New York City, is that we journalists know better than everybody.  We know better than everybody.  All right?  We're smarter, all right, than the president, the senators, the mayors, particularly a barbarian like Trump.  That's really -- the fangs are really out because they don't think -- they being journalists -- that Trump is worthy enough to even run.  He's not worthy.  So, that's what you're seeing.  And that's absolute bias.  WALLACE:  Speaking of bias, you and your show is getting hammered right now for Jesse Watters and the piece he did on Chinatown.  Let's show a clip.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JESSE WATTERS:  Am I supposed to bow to say hello?(INAUDIBLE)WATTERS:  I like these watches.  Are they hot?  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Now, you know this piece is being widely criticized as, quote, ""racist"".  O'REILLY:  Do you want me to give you the accurate report?  WALLACE:  Well, do you think it was over the line?  Do you regret it?  O'REILLY:  I would have edited it a little bit differently than it was edited.  No, it wasn't over the line.  We ran that piece on Monday of last week, OK?  Five million people plus saw it live.  You know how many negative letters we got?  Less than ten.  You know how many phone calls came in to Fox News?  Zero, as far as I know.  We checked, OK?It was 36 hours later that this outrage appeared.  And where did it appear?  Far left websites, far left (INAUDIBLE).   I read every single one.  They're all the same.  So, this is an attack on Fox News.  That's what it is.  It's happened before.  I thought it was a gentle piece.  There were a few things in there I felt were over the line.  The little old lady, I would have taken that out.  I should have seen it before, but I'm so busy with the election that I didn't.  But Watters is a gentle satirist.  He's worked very well for us.  And we're proud of him.  This is an organized campaign.  This is what they do.  They've done it before.  WALLACE:  All right.  Let's turn to this.  O'REILLY:  Yes.  WALLACE:  Your latest best seller, ""Killing The Rising Sun.""  Now, I have a confession to make.  I had never read any of the ""Killing"" books.  O'REILLY:  You're fired.  You have to get out of the building right now.  WALLACE:  Until this one.  (LAUGHTER)WALLACE:  I got to tell you -- no, I'm being honest and serious here, I thought it was gripping.  I learned a lot.  I was thoroughly entertained.  I read somewhere you said history is fascinating, but history books are too often boring.  O'REILLY:  Nine hundred pages.  WALLACE:  This is anything but boring.  O'REILLY:  No, but now you have to go back and read the others.  WALLACE:  Well, no, I want to.  O'REILLY:  Right?  You have to read the other five.  WALLACE:  Yes.O'REILLY:  Look, what Martin Dugard and I have crafted is a franchise for people who want to know about history, but they don't have time to read 900 pages.  So, we give you 300 action-packed pages.  WALLACE:  No, I love it.  It's in present tense.  O'REILLY:  Right.WALLACE:  You have a lot of details I've never heard before.  O'REILLY:  Dugard is a brilliant researcher.  We put you on the ground when that atom bomb drops.  So, you're right there on the ground.  We put you on Iwo Jima with the Marines right next to them.  WALLACE:  All right.  I'm going to talk about the atom bomb because you explore the controversy, which has lasted ever since Hiroshima, about whether it was right to drop the atom bomb.  And you come down firmly on the side it was absolutely the right decision.  O'REILLY:  Yes, and for selfish reasons.  I wouldn't be here.  My father --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  Wait, wait, wait, because -- no, I want to interrupt you, I want to interrupt you as you always do, because let's put this picture up on the screen.  This is the surprise that comes out in the book, that this guy, an unnamed ensign in the middle of the Pacific during World War II named William J. O'Reilly.  O'REILLY:  That's right.  So I have an emotional attachment.  But I decided to write the book because of Reverend Wright, because of President Obama's preacher, when he said goddamn America, the chickens are coming home to roost for Nagasaki and Hiroshima.  When I heard that, my head snapped.  I said, wait a minute, you know, that's wrong.  Let me -- and some day I'm going to clarify the record.  And here's some day, right here, ""Killing the Rising Sun.""  And the interesting thing that we did was we asked the five living presidents if they would have done what Truman did.  WALLACE:  You have the letters in the back of the book.O'REILLY:  We have the actual letters.  I asked them to write to me personally.  WALLACE:  Right.O'REILLY:  President Obama wouldn't write to me, because I don't believe he would have dropped the bomb.  I don't believe he would.President Clinton didn't answer because his wife is running for president.  He didn't want a controversy.  The other three presidents, Jimmy Carter and the two Bushes, said they would have.  We show you why.  They gave their reasons why.  WALLACE:  Finally, you have been talking recently about the possibility -- actually, you say the real chance that you might leave ""The Factor,"" because you say you're tired of working this hard.  O'REILLY:  I work hard.  WALLACE:  Well, OK.  Let me just say -- and we're roughly the same age.  We've both been in the business roughly the same time.  You're not going anywhere.  O'REILLY:  You look so much older than me, that comment just startled me.  WALLACE:  You are not going anywhere.  Why do you even pretend that?  O'REILLY:  Here's the deal.  Right now in my life, I have accomplished everything that I have ever wanted to accomplish, in my whole life.  It's a miracle.  It is a miracle I'm sitting here across from the legendary Chris Wallace, all right?  I have no more things to accomplish.  WALLACE:  I understand, but look at my father.  You do it and then you get up the next day and you do it again.  And he didn't do it at 80 (ph).O'REILLY:  You know I loved him.  WALLACE:  I know you did.O'REILLY:  But I have to evaluate how much, all right, of the acrimony I want to absorb because I am the target.  I am the target, all right?  Every single day of my life.  I have to have bodyguards, all right?  I have to have security.  Do I really want to do this?  Now, I think that ""The Factor"" is still a very worthy enterprise, and we help a lot of people.  We employ a lot of people.  So, my decisions are very, very difficult.  They will be taken very methodically.  But I'm not in it like Andy Rooney until I'm 90.  I'm not.  So, we'll see what happens.  WALLACE:  Chances you'll be working on ""The Factor"" five years from now?  O'REILLY:  I could be fired.  My ratings could go down.  WALLACE:  Chances you'll be doing it five years from now?  O'REILLY:  I can't handicap it.  A lot of it has to do with your health too.  Wallace and I are old guys.  We could wake up tomorrow wheezing.  You know, if we do, we have to get out.  WALLACE:  Bill O'Reilly, everyone.  O'REILLY:  Thank you for reading the book, Wallace.  It's about time.  WALLACE:  And now, I've got so many more books to read.  The name of the book, ""Killing the Rising Sun.""  Bill, great to have you here.  Congratulations on the book.  O'REILLY:  All right.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  Up next, the latest on the damage from Hurricane Matthew.  Plus, our power player of the week, trying to stand up to hurricane force winds.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  A look at the latest radar as a weakened Matthew, now a post-tropical cyclone, churns off the coast of the Carolinas.  Matthew brought record flooding to the Carolinas, more than 1 million people along the Eastern Seaboard are without power.  At least 14 deaths are now blamed on Matthew in the U.S. and hundreds more in Haiti.  We heard a lot this week about the damage different categories of hurricanes can do based on their wind speed.  As we told you last year, there's a place outside Washington that studies this kind of thing.  Here's our power player of the week.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  In the 21st century, why do we need wind tunnels?  Can't you do this all on computer models?  DR. JEWEL BARLOW, GLENN L. MARTIN WIND TUNNEL DIRECTOR:  Short answer is no.  WALLACE:  Dr. Jewel Barlow is director of the Glenn L. Martin Wind Tunnel of the University of Maryland.  Since 1949, they've tested how everything from plane models to cars to roofing performed in high winds.  And that will tell you how efficient or inefficient it is.  BARLOW:  Or whether it'll survive in the case of a hurricane.  WALLACE:  The week we were there, they watched how safety signs for offshore oil rigs would stand up for one hour to 100-mile-per-hour winds.  BARLOW:  What you can find out is whether that particular product will survive in any given wind speed.  WALLACE:  Barlow took us inside the wind tunnel, starting with a giant fan.  BARLOW:  There's a 2,000-horse-power electric motor here that drives this guy.  It's about 20 feet in diameter.  We can generate wind up to 230 miles per hour in the test section.  WALLACE:  We wanted to get a feel for a wind test.  And student Isaac Roberts agreed to participate.  BARLOW:  All right.  Andrew, give us 50 miles an hour.  Tropical storm conditions.  WALLACE:  And he can handle that pretty easily.  BARLOW:  Pretty easily, yes.  WALLACE:  But it got tougher at 80 miles per hour, a category 1 hurricane.  BARLOW:  Yes.  When we -- at 80 miles per hour, nobody can stand straight up like this without the tethers.  OK, let's go to 100, guys.  This will be a category 2 hurricane speed.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wow.  BARLOW:  I have to say, he's bolder than most people we've seen in here.  WALLACE:  And then they cranked up the fan even higher.  BARLOW:  This will be 115 miles per hour, category 3.  WALLACE:  So, we're talking about a serious hurricane at this point.  BARLOW:  This is a serious hurricane.  WALLACE:  Barlow has been director of the tunnel since 1977, but he reminded me wind experiments are still more precise than any computer model.  BARLOW:  The discovery, new ways to understand air flow is still very fascinating to me.  Maybe we're slow learners, but we're still learning.  WALLACE:  And that's the challenge of it.  BARLOW:  And that's the challenge.  (END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  At its peak, Hurricane Matthew was a category 4 with winds of up to 145 miles per hour.  Now this program note, stay tuned to Fox News Channel for coverage of the second presidential debate.  And that's it for today.  Have a great week.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MARIA BARTIROMO, HOST: Good Sunday morning, everyone. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Welcome to ""Sunday Morning Futures.""Remembering Justice Antonin Scalia. The influential conservative of the Supreme Court dead at the age of 76. His legacy, the impact on the court, coming up. Plus, the debate over his replacement.Fireworks. Six of the remaining GOP candidates trading jabs last night ahead of the critical primary ahead of South Carolina. Who were the winners and losers? Ahead.Plus, my exclusive interview with House Speaker Paul Ryan. His take on immigration and the state of the economy today, as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""(MUSIC)BARTIROMO: The country pauses to remember Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia, the iconic conservative justice who served since 1986, died yesterday at the age of 79. And now, this gives President Obama the chance to shift the balance on the high court, by appointing a successor.My guest this morning, Thomas Dupree, a constitutional attorney, and John Yoo, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department.  He was also a law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and knew Justice Scalia.Good to see you, gentlemen. Thanks very much for joining us.THOMAS DUPREE, CONSTITUTIONAL ATTORNEY: Good morning.JOHN YOO, FORMER LAW CLERK TO JUSTICE THOMAS: Thank you.BARTIOMO: So, John, let me kick this off with you, Mr. Yoo. You clerked for Clarence Thomas. Let's talk about the man and the legacy of Justice Scalia.YOO: In terms of legacy, Justice Scalia is the leading light of the conservative revolution in the law. When he came to the court, he put a stake into the heart of the Warren court, what we call the Warren court and its cases, even though he came many years later. He really set the terms of debate for constitutional law ever since, just as today in politics we sure live in the world that Ronald Reagan said, today in constitutional law, we live in the world defined by Justice Scalia -- turning the attention to the text, and the history of Constitution, being conscious of judicial restraint and deferring to the democratic process, and rejecting the idea most importantly that the Constitution evolves and changes.He firmly believed that the Constitution endures based on its meaning at the time it was ratified. Those who agree with him and disagree with him still argue with it in terms of that debate today.BARTIROMO: Tom Dupree, he was known as saying words say what they say, words matter, really known for his integrity, defending the Constitution, to the exact word. Your thoughts on his legacy?THOMAS DUPREE, CONSTITUTIONAL ATTORNEY: That's exactly right. One of the things he always maintained fidelity to the original intent of our framers.  One of the points he would often makes in this opinions, frequently dissenting opinions, was, what kind of country do we live in if at the pass off some of the most decisions to what he would call nine unelected lawyers? He had a great respect for democracy, he had a great respect for the structure, this wonderful structure that the framers bequeathed to us.And he did everything he could in his power to maintain and preserve it, and he did as John said, changed the terms of the legal debate in this country.BARTIROMO: It's true. Also proud Italian-American I should point out.Now, after his death, Obama has an opening to shift the balance in the Supreme Court. Where does this go now? Let's talk about the process, and what the president now will do in terms of shifting the balance on the Supreme Court?Tom, how do you see it?DUPREE: Well, I think the fate of the Supreme Court will be in the hands of the Senate Republicans form the president within hours of the news yesterday announced his intent to push forward with a nominee.I think that's not the right decision, I think it's hasty. The president is determined to get someone up, get someone nominated, get someone confirmed.And so, I think the spotlight will shift to the Republicans in the Senate, and whether or not they want to allow this to proceed or whether they want to defer and permit the new president to make his or her selection.BARTIROMO: Right. Which is why, John, almost immediately you heard from the candidates running for president, basically saying leave it to the American people. Let's see what the American people want once this election is through, and have the next president nominate and appoint someone.YOO: If you're a Republican candidate or a Republican in the Senate, the last person you want to give the pick to is President Obama, who many of his decisions I think have violated the Constitution are actually before the Supreme Court right now and are going to be affected by Justice Scalia's passing. I suspect he won't pick someone seriously, because he already knows the Senate won't confirm anyone, so someone symbolic he can use to beat on the heads of the candidates for not confirming, because the Senate won't confirm them, and it would be one of the many issues that this election is going to be important for, is the future direction of the Supreme Court.BARTIROMO: Right. So, it sounds like you don't think that the president will be successful in actually pushing his nominee through?YOO: No, there's a precedent for this. In 1968 in the last year of President Johnson's administration, Chief Justice Earl Warren was sat down and President Johnson tried to appoint Fortas. Justice Fortas, the Supreme Court -- I'm sorry, the Senate tried to filibuster and did successfully, and the seat was left open for President Nixon to fill.BARTIROMO: Yes, let me ask you, Tom, you to go through a couple important cases now pending in front of the Supreme Court. So, viewers understand what's at stake over the near term?DUPREE: Well, where to begin, Maria? Coming up this term, we have the challenge to the president's executive action on immigration. We have a very significant abortion case that's coming up, there's affirmative action cases. There are cases concerning separation of powers.So, I think there are many, many critical issues that now are going to be decided by the Supreme Court, scheduled to be decided in the next few months. As John noted, many of these concerned actions the president himself did. So there's no surprise he wants his ninth point to pass judgment on the legality of the constitutionality of his own actions.BARTIROMO: Yes, I think that is absolutely right. So, do you agree with Tom then, John, in terms of the president probably broadband unlikely to get his nominee through or just symbolic?DUPREE: I think it will be very difficult, but to me it's not entirely clear which strategy the president is going to take. I agree with John it's possible he'll make a political choice and someone he can use to rile up his political base. It's also possible he may look to a nominee who at least the president would try to portray as a consensus nominee, someone who could draw support from Republicans and Democrats alike, but of course the objective there too would also be to score political points by saying, look, I put up someone who should command assent and agreement, and the Republicans rejected him.So, whichever way it cuts, I suspect the president is going to view this through a political lens.BARTIROMO: Yes, really important points that you both make. John Yoo, Tom Dupree, thanks very much for joining us this morning. Gentlemen, we appreciate your time. We'll see you soon.DUPREE: Thank you.YOO: Thanks.BARTIROMO: The death of Justice Scalia just one of the many topics in last night's Republican meanwhile and were turned outing to be a verbal slugfest last night.Take a look at the high stakes showdown in South Carolina. How it will impact next week's primary.Follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures, and let us know what you'd like to hear.Coming up on the program, we're speaking with House Speaker Paul Ryan coming up. Stay with us as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: A showdown in South Carolina and the sparks went flying.

He's had the gall to go after my mother.(BOOS)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The World Trade Center came down under his brother's reign remember that.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Some boos there at the end.I want to bring in Republican Congressman Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, who's a member of the House Freedom Caucus.Sir, good to have you on the program. Thanks so much for joining us.REP. MICK MULVANEY, R-S.C.: Maria, good morning. Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: So, you're a lifelong resident of the Carolinas. Let me get your take on that exchange and the boos we heard when Donald Trump basically tried to say that it was George W. Bush's fault that the Trade Towers came down.MULVANEY: Yes, that was strange. I'm not really sure why Mr. Trump did that. It was a fairly pro-Bush audience last night, you could tell that during the introductions. And as critical as Trump has been of different parts of the Bush presidency, I don't know of anybody generally in the country who blames George Bush for 9/11, and certainly nobody in that room blamed George Bush for 9/11. That was the strange part of the day or the evening. Of course, it was a strange evening for most of the time.BARTIROMO: What do you think this plays for the people who are going to be going and voting next Saturday in the primary in South Carolina?MULVANEY: Yes, I didn't n think that Mr. Carson, Dr. Carson, did particularly well, and I don't think the Jeb Bush did particularly well.  I'm not sure why he was attacking Donald Trump. First of all, he's not going to get Donald Trump's voters away from him in the first place. And secondly, even if he did peel them off, they would go to Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio. So, I'm not really what Mr. Bush, what Governor Bush was trying to accomplish last night. I don't think he did particularly well.I think John Kasich did fairly well. I thought that Marco Rubio did well and I thought that Cruz and Trump and sort of tread water. So, my guess is you won't see Dr. Carson do very well and you won't see Governor Bush do very well next Saturday.BARTIROMO: Wow, OK. It's interesting because it felt like these last couple days, Jeb Bush was getting his sea legs a bit back, fighting back a little more aggressive, but you don't think -- but you don't think it's going to necessarily materialize in votes?MULVANEY: Well, look, if he's going to do well, he'll do well in South Carolina. South Carolina is a good place for him. That was a good audience for him last night. I don't think he had a Newt Gingrich type of moment. People forget that four years ago, Newt Gingrich was in fourth place and he ended up winning through a strong debate performance. I don't think we saw that last night from Governor Bush. So, as effective as he may have been, I don't think he changed places. In fact, if anything, he probably lost ground to Kasich.BARTIROMO: And I guess, you know, Kasich really is doing much better than before. He's emerging. In terms of the most important issues to the people in South Carolina, what do you think number one and two issues are?MULVANEY: Immigration still drives a lot of things here. Immigration still drives a lot of the debate. You saw that last night and you saw where that was probably more of the meat of the discussion, the candidates tended to agree on a lot of the areas until they got to immigration, and then there was a brought variety of policies on display. I thought that was helpful and good for the debate.The one thing that disappointed me was the words ""debt"" and ""deficit"" were only mentioned twice. The word was only mentioned twice last night once by Mr. Bush and once by Dr. Carson. And that's unfortunate because that I think that's driving a lot of discussion here in South Carolina as well.BARTIROMO: And you have to give Donald Trump credit for pounding on this issue of immigration. Actually, we're going to be speaking with House Speaker Paul Ryan who joins us at the bottom of the hour.Let me get your take on Justice Scalia. Obviously, a lot of conversation and talk this morning about his fantastic legacy. What would you like to see take place this morning in terms of the president fighting back, saying, look, he's going to nominate the next justice?MULVANEY: I have to give credit to Governor Kasich. I'm not one of his supporters, but I thought his answer was the most thoughtful. We all know somebody will pick the president. If you're the president, you're going to nominate somebody.But when Governor Kasich suggested the president that he pick somebody with bipartisan support and be a uniting force on the court, I thought that was a good answer. Maybe the president would serve well to follow that advice.  My guess is that's not going to happen.BARTIROMO: Do you think the president will be able to get his nominee through?MULVANEY: No.BARTIROMO: Simple answer there.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Sir, good having you on the program this morning. Thanks very much.MULVANEY: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: We will see you soon.Joining us there, Congressman Mulvaney.House Speaker Paul Ryan will join me for an exclusive interview on his agenda during the president's final year in office and the issues most critical to our national security.We're looking ahead this morning on ""Sunday Morning Futures."" Paul Ryan is next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.My next guest, House Speaker Paul Ryan, reacting to the shocking news yesterday of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's death, releasing a statement saying in part, quote, ""The passing of this brilliant jurist is a great loss, but his writings will guide generations to come. I learned so much from this man. I knew him. I respected him. I looked up to him. We all did.""Meantime, Speaker Ryan laying out the top priorities for Congress in the final year of President Obama's term and beyond. I spoke exclusively with the speaker earlier about his agenda, after receiving the president's budget last week.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Speaker Ryan, thanks so much for joining us this morning.REP. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: My pleasure. Thanks for having me, Maria.BARTIROMO: Good to see you.You have announced a six committee-led task force charged with developing a bold new growth agenda that will be presented to the country in the coming months. Can you go through some of those priorities for us?RYAN: Sure. Basically five big priorities that we think are in desperate need of reform. Number one, growing the economy. That's things like tax reform and energy development, and getting the regulatory burden lifted from our small businesses.Number two, we've got a lot of people in poverty, Maria we are not re- claiming the American idea, this notion of upward mobility and opportunity.  There are a lot of people who don't believe it's there for them anymore and we have to have better ideas for getting people out of the poverty and reforming welfare so we get people from welfare to work.Number three: ObamaCare isn't working, it's failing, and our health care entitlements are bringing us to a debt crisis. We've got to address that.  And so, we have to go from being an opposition party to being a proposition party. And part of that means, what will we replace ObamaCare with. What are our solutions for patient-centered health care?Number four, the national security is a wreck. The military is under duress. We don't really even have a foreign policy. So, we need to show people what a vision likes look.And number five, arguably most important, how do we re-claim the Constitution? How do we reclaim the principles of self-government and government by consent? How do we get the separation of powers put back on track, so that we truly have checks and balances, so that people do have representative government and not this government by bureaucrat, which is really the trend these days?All five of these things we think are necessary to see our country back on track. We don't think the nation is heading in the right direction, and we believe we owe it to our fellow citizens to offer an alternative. And this is what we could accomplish with a Republican president in 2017. And so, that is basically what we're going to lay out.I learned this in 2012 running with Mitt Romney. I think we owe the company a really clear choice. We can't wait until fall to put this choice out there in the crescendo of a presidential election. We need to do this earlier so that we can talk about it all summer, all fall long, so that we really truly give people a clear choice so that the people of this nation gets to choose, and this is what you can do with a Republican president to get our country back on track.And that's the agenda that we're fashioning. And we're doing it bottom up.  It's not a top-down, you know, one person taking it. It's all members of the Republican conference listening to our constituents, talking to interested parties, and putting it together. And that's what we're doing right now.BARTIROMO: Yes, I think you make all great points, and I know that viewers agree that these are the priorities. I want to go through some of those priorities with you, particularly tax reform, given what's going on with the economy right now.But let me start with national security as it relates to immigration, because I feel like one of the biggest issues this election cycle has been immigration. We know that every year the U.S. issues 1 million green cards to immigrants, and yet polls show, they continue to show that voters think that's too many. That immigrants are taking American jobs at the time that this economy is not producing enough jobs.Would you support legislation to cap the number of immigrants and green cards issued?RYAN: Well, I've always believed, look, we're not going to put immigration reform other than securing the border in our national security agenda. We think a key component in national security is actually securing the border.  So, that will be the component, but you're asking something different than that.I have always supported from what people call a chain migration system to an economic-based immigration system. And that's not what we have -- most countries choose how to give the visas out based on their economic needs, if there is work that is not being done. And that's not what we do and I think we should change that immigration policy.I don't want to confuse what our agenda. We're not going to be dealing with those things other than as part of our national security agenda, making sure we secure the country, secure the border, so that we know who's coming and going in this country, which we right now do not have and it's a serious national security threat.BARTIROMO: Right. And you've been very vocal in terms of the path to citizenship, in terms of securing the border. I feel like this is one of the central or fundamental issues of the country, right? How do you know and who is allowed to live in this country? Work in this country, participate in our democracy?PAUL: Can I get --BARTIROMO: Given the pushback from the voters, even the candidates in terms of number of green cards issued, would you not put a cap?PAUL: Yes, we have a cap, and we can have a good debate about where that cap is set, but I would say what kinds of green cards are we giving out?  Should we be giving green cards out based on who you're related to? Or should be giving green cards based on what you contribute to the American economy?I would argue we should be giving more green cards out based upon what you contribute to the economy. But let's not paper over a problem. That is labor force participation is abysmally low in this country. We haven't seen thinks rates since the Carter years. What does that mean?That means we have tens of millions of American citizens who are able- bodied adults, who are not working, who are not looking for a job or who are not even getting an education or a skill, or being in school to get a job. That's what I think we need to be focusing on, is how do we get people out of poverty into work, how do we get people from welfare back into the workforce.Tens of millions of people are right here in this country that aren't working that should be working for their own sake, for the economic growth, and we don't want to have a culture of dependency. We want to have a culture of entrepreneurship. We want to have a culture of people rising, of people getting out of poverty, of people defining and deciding their own lives.And so, to me, Maria, before we talk about how many green cards, let's make sure we get people in our communities who aren't working back to work.  That to me the biggest labor problem we have right nowBARTIROMO: Right. But isn't this issue central to that? Because Americans do not have the jobs they need to have, partly because you've got foreigners coming in taking their jobs. So that's the central issue really that I'm asking you. Do we want to keep open borders the way we have?PAUL: No, no.BARTIROMO: Or do we want some level of cap?PAUL: Yes.BARTIROMO: Again, would you propose legislation that lowers the number of green cards issued?PAUL: I'm not going to get into the details. I think we should have a cap, of course, and I think we should change the way we give green cards so that we have economic-based visas.Let Congress do its job and work its will on how those -- where those caps and how those caps should be adjusted and set. But of course we should have a cap. None of this works if we don't have a secure border.That is why a part of our five-point agenda is national security, building our military, and securing the border, but also, don't forget we've to get in this country, who are citizens in this country, from welfare to work. I think that's really important.And first point, as we mentioned, tax reform, energy development, regulatory reform, what do those things do? They decide whether we have economic growth or not, they decide whether we have rising wages or not, they decide whether people are getting a raise, whether people can save for their kids' colleges or for retirement. That's the critical thing.So, that is why we're going to be offering a bold specific, pro-growth agenda, to grow this economy, get people from welfare to work and make sure that we have a secure country. So, that's why we're not going to be talking about visa caps in our agenda and promising what we're going to do if we have a Republican president. We're going to be talking about how to grow the economy, get people from welfare to work and secure this border, secure this country.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: All right. Stay right there. More of my conversation with Speaker Ryan coming up. I'm going to tackle the economy and trade next with the speaker as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures."" Back in a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: So, how worried are you about the growth story of today?RYAN: I'm very worried about it.BARTIROMO: I mean, you're talking about a economy growing barely two percent, the worst beginning to the year of the stock market of any year ever. There's clearly nervousness out there, $2 trillion of wealth wiped out just in 2016. How did we get here?RYAN: Government. I mean, look, Obamanomics. You have a regulatory state that is just on fire. They're regulating left and right.This is a fourth branch of government that's unaccountable to the people, so you have a chilling effect of job creation. A chilling -- I was in Milton, Wisconsin, the other day talking to two guys, two brothers who left their jobs, started a small business. They have 40 people. They could grow faster, they could grow more, but they're turning away business, because they could hit the 50 employee cap because of Obamacare and the costs that were incurred with that.BARTIROMO: Right.RYAN: So, you have government regulation and government and laws like ObamaCare, taxes that are stifling economic growth. I would argue strongly, Maria, that our fiscal policy, no path to balancing budget, no president supporting a balanced budget, tax rates that are extremely high, making us extremely uncompetitive, keeping money overseas, and a regulatory state that is killing jobs especially in the energy sector.So, it is government, it is the federal government that is putting all these barriers in place and disallowing businesses and people to grow. If we have a pro-growth economic policy, there's no doubt in my mind we can get this economy growing faster, people could get better jobs, get rising wages, but for our government. And that's why we're going to roll an agenda out there and give the country a choice, here's what we will do if you give us the ability to do it so that we can do it in 2017.BARTIROMO: Also why you've announced the budget plan is dead on arrival.RYAN: Of course.BARTIROMO: I mean, the president has said that he wants a string of new taxes, $2.6 trillion in new taxes over the coming decade, he wants a controversial oil fee to pay for infrastructure, $10 oil tax. You said it has zero chance of passing in Congress.So, we know the conservatives are upset. So, they want to know, are you going to propose a new budget this year? Or are you going to allow the president to continue his agenda of climate change, of refugees, of Obamacare? What's your answer?RYAN: Well, first of all, just so you know, Maria, if we want to get rid of ObamaCare, if we want to change who is running the regulatory state, you have to have a new president. We have proven by passing through our reconciliation procedures, we can get a bill on the president's desk. We just did that. He vetoed it and we had a veto override.So, we have proven we are willing and able to put bills on a president's desk to get rid of all those things you just said. Guess what? You've got to have a president sign those bills into law.BARTIROMO: Right.RYAN: That's why you need a new president. That's why we're putting in an agenda out there in 2017 showing how we would do that. We have passed five budgets that specifically show -- I wrote four of them, that specifically show how we would balance the budget, how we can pay off the debt.We can do this, but you have to have a Republican president to do this, and that's the whole point of our agenda.BARTIROMO: Right. I understand that, but I mean, I guess people are frustrated the spending of this year is locked in.RYAN: No kidding.BARTIROMO: Yes.RYAN: Well, the spending for this year is locked in because we have a bipartisan agreement which makes sure that, by the way, there's a big concern about our national defense, about our military. And we are fixing some of that, I would argue because of our president we're not doing any near what we need to do to fix our foreign policy and our military.By the way, because of a Republican legislature, because we've had the majority, we have actually cut discretionary spending. We've actually had real actual spending cuts, hundreds of billions will have been saved because we were in the majority versus the Democrats being in the majority, because of what we have done under discretionary spending, but that's a third of our budget.It's entitlements that are going to be the cause of the debt crisis. These programs are going bankrupt and we have a president that refuses to do anything about it. We have a president that has rejected every single idea to balance the budget and pay off the debate that's been presented to him so the theme of this point here is we need a new president.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, there was nothing in the budget whatsoever about Social Security. I mean, it's crazy. When everybody knows what the problems are.Final question, this is about trade, Mr. Speaker. It goes back in the summertime you were approaching the fast track of the Trans Pacific Partnership. Where does the TPP stand right now?RYAN: I wrote the law, the Trade Promotion Authority law, which gives Congress the say-so, the final say-so on whether or not we're entering a trade agreement. Right now, I don't see the votes there for TPP, because I think the administration negotiated an agreement with problems, flaws in it. They're going to have to figure those out and work those out if they want to get the votes to pass in Congress, which I don't see the votes there right now.BARTIROMO: So, is it dead then? I mean, if you don't see the votes there --RYAN: No, I wouldn't say it's dead, I wouldn't say it's dead. But right now, they have a lot of work to do. If we brought it to the floor today, it wouldn't pass. That is the point I make.BARTIROMO: But that's the point I'm trying to make. If you don't have the votes now, why would you have the votes later? I mean, when you -- does it actually need fundamental change? When you look at --RYAN: You know, I think that's the point I'm trying to make, Maria. I think there are things that need to be addressed. I won't go into all the details, but cross-border data flows, dairy, there are biologics, intellectual property rights protection. The point I'm trying to make is I don't see the votes for this agreement now. That's why I think they need to go back and work on this agreement.BARTIROMO: Can you commit not trying to get it to pass during a lame-duck Congress? I mean, what I'm trying to say, if it's not going to pass now, if you can't get the votes now, what do you want to change in order to get the votes?RYAN: I'm not going to -- look, I don't know -- I'm the speaker of the house, I'm not the dictator of the House, I'm not the micromanager of the House. And I don't see where these votes are right now and I'm just being honest with people about that, and I don't know if and when that's going to change.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about the broad economy right now. What do you think is the most important lever to push in order to see growth move? Is it tax reform? And do you think you can get tax reform done in the first term?RYAN: You cut out there for a second. Done in the next president's first term?BARTIROMO: Yes.RYAN: Yes, 2017 is our plan.BARTIROMO: You think you can tax reform done, first year of a new president?RYAN: Yes. Yes. Ronald Reagan did it. Why can't we?Let me say this. I think the Federal Reserve with their loose money, with QE-forever I guess we call it now. You can't charitably say they tried to bail out policymakers for a while to give us time to right our ship. That never happened.The reason it never happened isn't because of the Congress. We've actually passed budgets dealing with the fiscal policy. We have a president who never wanted to tackle balancing the budget, getting us off the debt crisis path that we are on, and we have a president that wants higher tax rates, not lower rates.So, this has been our problem. So, we just blew eight years where we could have had a chance to get our fiscal policy right.So, do I believe in 2017 we can turn this around very quickly? Yes, I do.  I think tax reform is probably the biggest piece of this. I think regulatory reform, people giving smart regulation and regulatory certainty is critical key to unlocking capital and job formation, but I also think it's important to get or fiscal policy on track, that we show that we're going to balance the budget, we have a path to preventing a debt crisis.That helps takes our policy off the present collision course, and I think that's good for certainly, it's good for our currency, it's good for lots of reasons. And I think that is the secret to a pro-growth strategy.  Combined that with the fact we ought to be the dominant centering producer of the world, and we should be able to lock in those gains by unlocking this potential, which because of our government we are not.So, those three things right there, good physical past, opening up our energy policy, and painting our regulatory state and tax reform, those things in my mind are critical components of an economic growth policy, fiscal policy that in 2017 we need to get right on it. And that is why we want an election where we give people a really clear choice and commit ourselves to it so that we can finally what we need to do to get this turned around and get us back in the right track.BARTIROMO: I know this resonates with our viewers and certainly voters.  Good to see you, sir. Thanks very much, Mr. Speaker.RYAN: You bet. Thanks, Maria.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: There you have it, another presidential debate in the books.  GOP candidates hitting each other hard in South Carolina last night. We will talk winners and losers, what it means for when the Palmetto State heads to the polls. We're looking ahead this morning, on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: The smoke is still clearing after a fiery GOP presidential debate last night. The six remaining candidates facing off in South Carolina, the next state to go to the polls. Boy, was it brutal. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: For most of his life, his policies have been very, very liberal. For most of his life, he has described himself as very choice and a supporter of partial birth abortion.DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You are the single biggest liar, probably worse than Jeb Bush.This guy lied -- let me just tell you, this guy lied about Ben Carson when he took votes away from Ben Carson in Iowa, and he just continues.CRUZ: Marco went on Univision in Spanish and said he would not rescind President Obama's illegal executive am nest on the first day of office. I have promised to rescind every single illegal action, including that one.(CROSSTALK)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Very quickly -- first of all, I don't know how he knows what I want on Univision, because he doesn't speak Spanish. And second of all --(SPEAKING SPANISH)GOV. JOHN KASICH, R-OHIO, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Look, the bottom line is the people of this country and this state want to see everybody rise and they want to see unity. I don't want to get into this fighting tonight, because people are sig of the negative campaigning, and I'm going to stay positive about what I want to do.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Whoo, on that note, let's bring in our panel, Ed Rollins, who's a former principal White House adviser to President Reagan, also Fox News political analyst, Judith Miller, Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, author and Fox News contributor, and Mary Kissel, editorial board member at ""The Wall Street Journal.""Good to see you, everybody.Ed, winners and losers last night?ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: I think to a certain extent, the American people lost. I think this is a very derogatory, and from my perspective, if this is going to go two more debates like this, we're going to lose voters every single we have them on there.You can't be calling each other liars, you can't be turning each other down, and if you want to quote Ronald Reagan, who I obviously work for, they better practice what Ronald Reagan preached, which is, don't say nasty things about your opponents, Democrat or Republican, and in the death of Justice Scalia, one of the finest I've ever known, and he never basically would get into this kind of rhetoric, I just think it's outrageous to have this.BARTIROMO: Yes, I want to talk more about Justice Scalia, his legacy, as well as of course what happens now, because this is quite important.But let's stay on the debate for a second, Judy. How -- what are your observations?JUDITH MILLER, PULITZER PRIZE WINNING REPORTER AND AUTHOR: I think the company may have lost, Ed, if you were watching television, it was an extraordinary debate.BARTIROMO: Good TV.MILLER: Absolutely amazing.And I think Rubio helped himself a lot. I think he did not repeat a single thing he had said twice. And moreover, I think Kasich may have helped himself. I don't know if nice guys do not finish last, but I know when he said this calling one another liars, this invective, this helps get Hillary Clinton elected.BARTIROMO: Now, we know what happened last time, Romney/Obama.MILLER: Exactly.I think they all did well, but I think Trump was rattled. I think he wasn't used to being booed. Some of his assertions about, for example, we can come back to this WMD, these are Democratic talking points, and radical Democratic talking point and it was just outrageous.BARTIROMO: Yes.MILLER: And I think people reacted.BARTIROMO: You're right. All that booing, Mary, I wasn't expecting that.  It was a fair amount.MARY KISSEL, WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: It was an education at bloodletting. The New Hampshire primary did not winnow the field at all. This was about taking on the front-runner Donald Trump.And there were two essentially questions -- his temperament and whether or not his policies are sound and good for the nation and interests abroad.  We certainly learned about 'tis temperament last night. He repeated conspiracy theories that are worthy of MoveOn.org.In terms of his policies, we're finally seeing the candidates explaining what a Trump presidency would be. You saw Bush again explained eminent domain and how Trump has abused it. You saw Cruz talking about Trump on social issues, that he supports partial-birth abortions.And you also heard some education about foreign policy. Trump said he liked Putin, and both Cruz and Rubio pushed back on that and explain why that's a dangerous idea.So, yes, it wasn't fun thing to watch. It wasn't a pretty thing to watch, but I think the American public learned a lot last night.BARTIROMO: So, you think the plume is coming off the rose for Trump? It sounds --KISSEL: When you think temperate and policy, I think we're finally starting to get an insight into both of those issues.ROLLINS: I will guarantee Trump did not lose a supporter last night.BARTIROMO: Really?ROLLINS: People that are for him. The critical thing in politics is addition. He didn't add anybody and it's going to make it harder and harder for people on the other side to basically come support him in the end if he becomes the nominee.I think the reality is that the Democrats are very vulnerable. They look high-minded compared to this debate and I reality is we have many substantive things that we can lean, we've got four very substantive people left, the two governors, two senators, Carson needs to get off the stage, he knows nothing about politics. And no disrespect to him as a man, and Trump, obviously, is a big personality. You put it on Monday night wrestling, you get the same show and the same kind of ratings.BARTIROMO: We've got to jump, but I want to talk about who drops out next and also more with our panel on the political battle over the replacement of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.We're looking ahead this morning on ""Sunday Morning Futures."" We'll be right back. And what happens now.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back with our panel and back to our top story. The death of Justice Antonin Scalia.Back to our panel, Ed Rollins, Judy Miller, and Mark Kissel.Your thoughts on the man, the legacy, and what happens now, Ed?ROLLINS: He's one of the heroes of American politics. Certainly, one of the heroes of most important appointment Ronald Reagan made.I served on the judicial selection panel of the White House for five years.  He was one of the first ones going on the appeals court in 1982. He was the model I used to judge everybody else after that.He was impeccable. He was knowledgeable. He was a brilliant writer. He got along well with other people. And I just think he's very hard to replace.BARTIROMO: I agree with you. I mean, I interviewed him a couple times, actually. I always felt he came across not just so smart and with such integrity, but also down to earth.ROLLINS: He was a wonderful human being.BARTIROMO: He was a proud Italian-American, I'll tell that you.(LAUGHTER)ROLLINS: A very devout family man, a very devout Catholic, and a real role model for young lawyers. Whatever your ideology is, to have his integrity is very important.BARTIROMO: So, what happens now, Judy?MILLER: Well, I mean this is -- President Obama did not wait a nanosecond after talking about what a wonderful man he was.BARTIROMO: He's going to nominate.MILLER: He's going to nominate someone. This is the moment in which suddenly President Obama sees an opportunity to really establish the legacy, to change the balance on the Supreme Court.And my sense is he's going to go for it. He's going to try and nominate someone who can get through the Senate process which will be enormously difficult. But as long as President Obama is in legacy mode, this is his moment.BARTIROMO: Will he be able to do it, push his person through, Mary?KISSEL: I think the fact that we're even talking about this shows how politicized the court has become, especially under the Roberts court. One of the great virtues of Justice Scalia wasn't that he was a conservative and believed in conservative ideas, he's trying to return the court to its actual mission under the Constitution, which is the key to the Constitution and to interpret the text of the law.In fact, liberals should have loved him because liberals wouldn't want a conservative Supreme Court reinterpreting and making law. This was Scalia's great contribution.So, you know, when you heard President Obama come out last night, less than 24 hours after this great figure passed away and talk about politics, to me, it shows just how much the court has been degraded and how necessary and important it is to return the court to its original purpose under the next administration.ROLLINS: I agree with all. That there is only one person in America that he can get through and that's Vice President Biden. Senators couldn't vote against Biden because they have relationships. He's former chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He can sit as vice president.I'm not trying to argue that is what he's going to do. Nobody else will get through.MILLER: Or a liberal Republican.ROLLINS: No liberal Republican is going to get through, I promise you.BARTIROMO: A liberal Republican will not get through?ROLLINS: Why do we want a liberal Republican? Why do they want a liberal Republican? We had those by our own appointments. We don't want another --BARTIROMO: So you think he'll try to push through Biden even though there's been --ROLLINS: I think Biden is the only one he can get through. The Senate couldn't vote against Biden because there are too many friendships there.MILLER: I think we have to wait and see. I don't think this is going to be just a symbolic appointment.I think that President Obama, of all people, whose own policies, so many of them are now before the court, understands how important it is to change the judicial balance and he's not going to -- he's not going to say no to an opportunity.BARTIROMO: I thought President Obama himself wanted to be a Supreme Court judge. That's what Hillary and he agreed upon.KISSEL: I've heard that, too. If he were politically savvy, he would put up someone that Republicans would have a hard time delaying.BARTIROMO: So that he could get the job.(LAUGHTER)KISSEL: But, unfortunately, I mean, this is a hyper-politicized White House and, you know, I don't expect him to find a compromised candidate.BARTIROMO: All right. Short break then the one thing to watch in the week ahead. Back in a minute.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Back with our panel.Ed Rollins, I guess South Carolina --(CROSSTALK)ROLLINS: If Trump wins South Carolina after his performance last night, it's going to be very hard to stop him.BARTIROMO: Wow, what do you think, Judy, important?MILLER: Will we have a cease-fire in Syria? Will the bloodletting stop?BARTIROMO: Mary?KISSEL: The president is hosting a clutch of Asian dictators and autocrats. Is he going to say anything about human rights? I doubt it.BARTIROMO: That's certainly to watch. China reopens on Monday after being closed for the new year. I'll be covering that on the morning show tomorrow on the Fox Business Network.

This morning the President said this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: Overall effort will take time. There will be challenges ahead, but we're going to do what's necessary to take the fight to this terrorist group, for the security of the country and the region and for the entire world.Thanks. God bless our troops. God bless America.(END VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: But what took so long? On June 16th, Talking Points opined this way.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: I fully expect President Obama to begin bombing the al Qaeda army very soon. If he does not do that, it would be an enormous dereliction of duty. He is the Commander-in-Chief. Al Qaeda wants to kill us. So he must send a message to them and to the largely cowardly world. We will not allow savages to decimate the world. That is the message that must be sent.Again, I expect the Commander-in-Chief to begin bombing the al Qaeda army in Iraq and Syria forthwith.(END VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: Well, it took three months for Mr. Obama to finally make the call. The reason for the delay is twofold. First, the President is fearful of creating a wider war, because that will diminish his legacy of ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The President sees himself as a peacemaker, a civilizing force in a brutal world. He's much more interested in fighting global warming than some killers in a desert.But when the American people began demanding action after ISIS beheaded two American citizens, the President had no choice but to act.Second, for some reason America's intel system is not working properly. The USA was caught by surprise when ISIS invaded Iraq again caught unaware when Putin took Crimea. By the way, Putin condemned the Syrian bombing last night saying it violated that country's sovereign territory. That's what Putin said.Overall, Washington seems befuddled by the danger we the people face. Former Obama administration officials like Leon Panetta and Robert Gates say the fault lies with a timid Commander-in-Chief. And that's most likely true. But because security decisions are shrouded in secrecy we don't know for sure. Mr. Obama did have a point when he declined to send weapons to the so-called Syrian moderates citing lack of clarity as exactly they are. Tons of sophisticated U.S. weaponry now in the hands of ISIS because the corrupt Iraqi army abandoned the hardware.But now the fight is on because ISIS is so barbaric, so dangerous that it can no longer be ignored or allowed to prosper because politics impedes action against it. Last night, I called for a world-wide anti-terror mercenary army to be borne which would be trained and administered by the USA under the supervision of Congress. It would be funded by the coalition that President Obama's putting together.The idea is to have a rapid deployment force capable of confronting Islamic terrorist anywhere in the world without the chaotic political nonsense that prevents effective action against these killers. The memo is posted on Billoreilly.com and will have your mail on it later. But hear me on this that force will eventually have to happen.And that's ""The Memo""."
