This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!Hi, I'm Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching us tonight.The ""Talking Points Memo"" on the exploding Muslim invasion will be in our third segment this evening. But we lead with a new poll from CBS. It says Republican primary voters prefer Donald Trump and Dr. Ben Carson by a wide margin over the rest of the field. Mr. Trump at 27 percent is up three points from early August. Dr. Carson at 23 percent up a whopping 17 points.But there is a cautionary question. Republicans were asked is your mind made up or is it too early to be sure? 37 percent say made up; 63 percent too early.Joining us now from his golf club in Los Angeles, California is the Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. First of all, do you study to prepare for the debate tomorrow? Do you do any research or anything like that at all?DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I have to start off by saying I am not playing golf. I'm working. I'm out here at Trump National and it's an amazing place on the Pacific. And I'm only working. I'm not playing golf. I haven't played golf for a long time. Believe me.And as far as the research, I have sort of been doing it for the last 30 years, I guess, Bill. I don't know how you can prepare for something. I hear everybody is coming after me. We had one poll where I was at 40 in New Hampshire. I'm at 40, and second place I think was 12 or something.And you know, they are all coming after me is what I hear and whatever it is it is. Let's see what happens.O'REILLY: All right. So you are going to go in, you're going to wing it. People should know you are not allowed to bring in any notes. You are not allowed to bring any weapons in. You can't have you know, a samurai sword. You can have a piece of paper and a pen just like I do here. You're not going to wear the hat tomorrow night at the debate. Are you? Are you going to wear the hat?TRUMP: No, I'm only wearing it today because it's so windy out here on the Pacific. The wind is pretty strong so I didn't want my hair blowing around. I just have too much respect for your program.O'REILLY: Right. And beside if you have the hat they can't make fun of the hair. So you don't want to do that.TRUMP: That's true. That's true.O'REILLY: All right now, let's get serious for a minute.You had a big crowd in Dallas last night. A lot of people watched your speech on TV. But outside you had a couple of thousand demonstrators, Hispanics primarily.TRUMP: No, no, no. No, we didn't. We didn't have a couple of thousand. They had a very, very small group. We had thousands of Hispanics inside that were cheering louder than anybody. We had a very, very small group. Actually reported there was going to be 4,000 people and it turned out to be 2,000. It turned out to be about 1,000 people. Very few protesters.O'REILLY: Yes, yes. My question is this. Does that bother you that they were out there? Does that bother you?TRUMP: No. Because inside I had 20,000 people and it was a love fest. It was incredible. As you know the American Airlines Center where the Mavericks play it was packed and it was an amazing event. Again, we had everybody. We had the Tea Party. We had the Evangelicals. We had Hispanics. We had rich, we had poor. We had everybody. It was an absolute incredible evening.O'REILLY: All right. So you were happy with your turnout. I just wanted to know if those people outside bothered you.Now, I'm going to be one of the --TRUMP: Very, very few people outside -- Bill.O'REILLY: They'll never let me but if they did, these are the questions that I would ask you tomorrow night. Ready?TRUMP: All right.O'REILLY: Ok, Mr. Trump, the Club for Growth which is a conservative economic group says that you are a high tax guy and very liberal economically. What is your tax program specifically?TRUMP: Ok. Well, I'm going to announce it in three weeks but I'm actually lowering taxes and especially for the middle class. The hedge funds guys are going to have to pay because they pay practically nothing -- peanuts. But I'm lowering taxes overall. Lowering for corporations.And by the way, Club for Growth is a phony outfit. They came to my office a few months ago. They asked me for a million dollars. I said no. Tight after I told them no because I don't even know who these people are. Right after I told them no they came out with a negative kind of an ad. Now they've put on an ad.Just so I you understand. I'm lowering taxes. I'm not raising taxes.O'REILLY: On me -- ok. On me.TRUMP: So what they've said is a lie.O'REILLY: I make a lot of money. Not as much as you do. But I make a lot of money. So what is a fair rate, tax rate for me to pay for the federal government?O'REILLY: Well, I'm announcing it in three weeks, Bill. So I don't want to really do that. --(CROSSTALK)O'REILLY: Well, give me a hint so I can start to save. 40? What?TRUMP: No, no, no. Much lower. Your taxes are going to go down a little bit even though you make a hell of a lot of money. And the middle income is really going to go down big league. And hopefully we are going to simplify to a point where H and R block is going to be put out of business because the people to pay them a fortune because of the complexities.So we are going to be -- I think you are going to be very happy. We are going to be lowering taxes and we're going to make it really good. We're going to bring back the middle class. The hedge fund guys won't be that happy but they will still make a lot of money.O'REILLY: Ok. But if you say that tomorrow night that you're going to announce in three weeks, they're going to say you're dodging and all of that. And all the other guys are going to go --TRUMP: No, I'm not dodging.O'REILLY: That's what they're going to say.TRUMP: Very importantly taxes are going down and corporate taxes are going to go down and we are going to put people to work again. And I' going to bring jobs back from China and Mexico and Japan and all of the other places that are stealing our jobs. And we're going to have an economy that's going to be booming again because right now it's a disaster.O'REILLY: Ok. Now, your close and personal friend Hillary Clinton who went to your wedding and I'm sure gave you a nice present. She says she wants to debate you about women. All right? That you don't understand women and your policies are going to hurt women. Are you up for a one-on- one debated with Hillary Clinton over women?TRUMP: I love it. And I will tell you what, I have great respect. In fact, my wife and my daughter wanted me Ivanka and Milania wanted me really to discuss it because they know the respect I have for women. They know that I cherish women and I am going to take care of women, women's health issues.Jeb Bush was a disaster. He came out and he said he doesn't want to give them any kind of a subsidy to help them with women's health. And then he said he misspoke. But that was too late. No, I'm going to take care of women better than Hillary will take care of women. That, I can tell you. Hillary was the worst secretary of state.O'REILLY: Ok. Ok. We know that. We know that but I have got to challenge you on the women thing. I've got to challenge you on the women thing.TRUMP: All right. Go ahead.O'REILLY: Planned Parenthood, another damning video today comes out. One of their top executives are saying hey, you know, what I really don't want to talk about the harvesting of baby parts but you know we do it and everybody knows they do it and they make money doing it Planned Parenthood. So they're basically aborting babies but they're aborting them in a way that they can remove them from the woman and cut them up and sell their body parts for money.Ok. A lot of conservatives want to defund Planned Parenthood, period. No more government money in the face of this horrendous exposition. Here it is tonight. You have got to answer this yes or no. Would you vote to defund Planned Parenthood? Yes or no?TRUMP: Yes, I have seen it. And I think you know my stance on it. I have said it before. I have seen the video. Bill, I have seen the videos. I think it's a disgrace.O'REILLY: It is.TRUMP: The answer is I would vote to defund, yes.O'REILLY: Ok, good. I'm glad you answered that like that. Not because editorially but because I have got three more questions.Ben Carson is your main competition. Now, are you going to call him Dr. Welby tomorrow? He's a mediocre doctor? Are you going to do that tomorrow? Are you?TRUMP: No, I like Ben Carson. He is not a deal maker and we need somebody in this country that's going to get rid of the $19 trillion in debt, that's going to bring back our jobs, that's going to bring back our manufacturing.O'REILLY: But he says he is going to do that.TRUMP: Well, he is not going to do that you have to have that and, you know, like it's one of those things. He won't have that ability, in my opinion.O'REILLY: All right. But you are not going to call him a pinhead or anything like that.TRUMP: We need somebody with great ability for doing that.O'REILLY: You are not going to question his faith. You're not going to do any of that.TRUMP: No, I wouldn't do that at all. It depends on what he does with me.O'REILLY: Oh, no, no. You should take a pledge that you are not going to do it no matter what he does. All right -- last question.TRUMP: Look, I don't know who is coming from where. I hear everybody is going to be hitting me because I'm number one in the polls.O'REILLY: I would if I were there. I would hit you with a pie.TRUMP: And I'll respond accordingly Bill.O'REILLY: If I were there, I would hit with you everything I had because you are the leader. All right. They have got to get attention. And you know it's coming.Last question. The press. You said last night in Dallas, generally speaking, unfair to you. You really believe that or was that just hyperbole?O'REILLY: No, no. I think generally speaking unfair. I met some political reporters who are absolute horrible human beings and they are liars. I have also dealt with some that are extremely honorable, extremely talented and really good. But I have met some very devious people, some very bad people in the world of politics.When I deal in finance it's a little bit easier maybe because it's numbers. I don't have complaints. I have met some very, very dishonest people dealing in politics. There is no question about that.O'REILLY: All right. You are going to give a big address tonight -- foreign policy address. We will be listening to that. And we wish you the best in the debate as we wish the other 10 contenders and it's going to be very interesting and I hope you come back soon and tell us about that experience.TRUMP: Thank you, Bill.O'REILLY: All right.TRUMP: Thank you very much.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!BOLLING: Thanks for staying with us, I'm Eric Bolling in for Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching us this special addition of The Factor, Election 2016. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal seems to be testing out a new strategy to get noticed in the pack of 17 republican presidential contenders. He is punching up.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. BOBBY JINDAL (R-LA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald Trump is shallow. He has no understanding of policy. He is full of bluster. He has no substance. Folks, Donald Trump is not a serious person. This is a carnival act. And seeing that Donald Trump said that the Bible was his favorite book. Yet, when asked he couldn't even name a specific or a single Bible verse that was important to him that had an impact on him. Well, do you know why? Well, it's clear Donald Trump has never read the Bible. The reason we know he has never read the Bible, he is not in the Bible. Donald Trump is a narcissist, and he is an ego maniac.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Governor Jindal joins us now from Washington, D.C. So, Governor, this going after Trump, new strategy. What is it all about?JINDAL: Eric, thank you for having me. Look, the idea of America is slipping away from us. Eighteen trillion dollar of debt. Planned Parenthood selling baby parts across the country, our president who is about to allow Iran to become a nuclear power even while he doesn't stand by Israel. The Left is running the country into the ground. We have a once in a lifetime opportunity to get our country back. To apply conservative principles.BOLLING: Yes. But let's stay on the topic here. Okay, you clearly are going after Donald Trump. Is this to help pull your poll numbers up? I mean, you are struggling in the polls right now.JINDAL: Not at all. It's not about me. And the reason it's important to do this now, we as conservative have a choice to make. Do we apply our conservative principles or do we turn to a man who believes in nothing but himself. Eric, Donald Trump is not a liberal, he's not a conservative, he is not a democrat, he is not a republican, he is not a moderate. Donald Trump has no substance. He doesn't want to make America great again, he wants to make Donald Trump great. I love the idea of Donald Trump. I love this show. I love the politically incorrect language. I love going after the DC establishment. I love the outsider. I even think he's entertaining. I love the helicopter rides at the State Fair giving out Lindsey Graham's cellphone number, it was all great fun. But when you actually look at the reality of Donald Trump, there is a lot of foolishness there and lot of nonsense there.BOLLING: You know, and you have said Donald Trump needs to stay classy but then you have also said things like he looks like he has a squirrel sitting on his head.JINDAL: Well, that's right. I was asked about his attack on Carly Fiorina for going after her appearance. I said, he has no room of criticizing anybody's appearances given how his hair looks. But here is the bigger point. He is not against big government. He is just against big government that he doesn't control. He has been for socialized medicine, he's been for tax increases. Look, he changed his position constantly. He would implode in a general election. But even worse, if he were actually to get elected, we have no idea what he would do in office, Eric. The reality is, he doesn't believe in anything but Donald Trump.We need to elect a tested, true conservative. Now is the time to shrink the government economy. Now is the time to defund Planned Parenthood. Now is the time to stand by Israel. Now is the time to grow the American economy. We have a chance to apply our conservative principles. It's been fun. It's time to put him in the elevator. It's time to tell him he is fired. Tell them to go downstairs and give him a reality show. He is great fun, great ratings. Very entertaining. His diagnosis of the problem is right but the prescription is wrong.BOLLING: He has been listening and I know for a fact he listens to this program. He listens when I host this program. Because he yells at me sometimes. But listen, here is how he tweeted in response to your latest round of bullies back at him. He said, ""Oh wow, light weight Governor Bobby Jindal who's registered at less than one percent in the poll just mocked my hair so original."" Final thought, Governor?JINDAL: Eric, so I give him a speech and call him a narcissist and egomaniacs and he has no substance. And his take away, is he worried about his hair? He proves my point. He is a narcissistic clown. America must do better. Let's elect a conservative. Let's rescue the idea of America before it's too late.BOLLING: All right. Governor, thank you very much. Governor Jindal isn't the only candidate who got into it with Trump this week. Carly Fiorina was on the receiving end when the Donald told ""Rolling Stone"" magazine, quote, ""Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that? The face of our next."" Trump defended his comments saying, he wasn't talking about her looks.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: She mentioned something about me. She knocks me. And when somebody knocks me like Jeb Bush or anybody else. I at least decide that I think it's appropriate to fight back. But we're talking only about her persona. But, some comments are made as an entertainer. And as everybody said, as an entertainer is a much different ballgame.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Joining us now on the phone from Arizona, Carly Fiorina. Now Carley, do you accept Mr. Trump's explanation specifically that he wasn't talking about your face when he said face, he was talking about your persona?CARLEY FIORINA (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (on the phone): No. But I do accept his comments that he was speaking as an entertainer. And you know when I was in third grade, Eric, there was a little boy that really liked me. And he said mean things about me and you know pulled my pigtails all the time. And my husband and I have been together for over 30 years. But I think I know when someone is flirting with me.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: All right. I think we are breaking some news here. Donald is flirting with you through the ""Rolling Stone"" magazine. Let's talk a little bit about the upcoming debate. CNN announced this week that you will be one of the candidates in their prime time debate along with Donald Trump. That's going to be your approach dealing with him on that stage?FIORINA: Oh, you know, there are many fine candidates on that stage. My first objective, honestly, is to introduce myself to the American people. You know, half that audience doesn't know my name and doesn't know I'm running for president. And so I know it seems hard to believe, particularly maybe if you are a celebrity like Donald Trump, everybody knows who you are. But I still have the lowest name I.D. in the field by a wide margin. And so I need to introduce myself. People who may not know me.BOLLING: Will you use this back and forth that you have got with Trump. Basically you have a lot of buzz going right now. Will you use that and step it up in the debate?FIORINA: You know, my principle objective is to make sure that people know who I am. And what I have done. I have a track record of leadership, of problem solving, of challenging the status quo. I'm not an entertainer. I'm someone who started as a secretary. Became a chief executive and the only way you do that is to go from secretary to CEO is to deliver results, to solve problems, and to lead. And so people need to do that I'm sure there will be opportunities for me to respond to Donald Trump or to others. And I won't shy away from those opportunities.BOLLING: But fundamentally, I'm running for president because I think our nation needs the kind of leadership I will bring to the oval office. No doubt but I will tell you though the other nine candidates on that stage that aren't Donald Trump would love to be in your shoes where there is a lot of buzz about you and Donald Trump's feud. If nothing else it brings the attention Governor Jindal did it and he is on The Factor and obviously it works.FIORINA: Yes. Well, it's also true, Eric, that this isn't entertainment. This is serious. This is serious. Our nation is at a pivotal point. And Americans know it in their bones. So, it's very entertaining for us all to talk all about Donald Trump. And by the way, the media seems to talk about nothing else but Donald Trump in many cases but voters never ask me about him. Never. What voters ask me about is how do we get the economy growing? Why is America's leadership waning in the world? How do we cut this government down to size? Voters know this is a pivotal point. And so I think most people are tuning in because they actually want to know what candidates are going to do.BOLLING: Right. Carley, does it surprise you that he is doing as well as he is with the women voters? I have about 15 seconds.FIORINA: No, not necessarily. I think if you look at all of the outsiders together, the outsiders are polling over 60 percent of support.BOLLING: Yes. Okay.FIORINA: But I will tell you something else, there is one outsider moving up in the polls and gaining on Donald Trump and I am one of them.BOLLING: Carly, thank you.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.
