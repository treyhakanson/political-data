"This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" October 13, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, new fallout in the latest interview by President Obama where he accuses Fox News of trying to make him scary and raises new questions about people of faith.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. The president has made a lot of news in the last 24 hours, first in a big sit down with ""60 Minutes"" and now with a one-on-one talk with one of his favorite authors. It was a wide ranging conversation in which the president discussed American culture, democracy, religion and politics. Suggesting at one point that his initial success came because, quote, ""conservative media had not yet weighed in.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: It's interesting because we're talking Iowa. People always I think were surprised about me connecting with folks in small town Iowa. And the reason I did was, first of all, I had the benefit that at the time that nobody expected me to win. And so I wasn't viewed through this prism of Fox News and conservative media and making me scary.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: The president also putting forward a question, whose main assumption was that people of faith are often the most suspicious of others. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: How do you reconcile the idea of safety being important to you and you carrying a lot of bad taking faith seriously with the fact that at least our democracy and our civic discourse it seems as if folks who take religion the most seriously sometimes are also those who are suspicious of those not like them.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Hmm. Let's drill down on this one with two political messaging pros. Marc Thiessen is a Fox News contributor and former chief speechwriter for President George W. Bush. And Bill Burton, he's a former Obama White House deputy press secretary.Good to see you both. So, I'll start with you Marc from here in D.C., it's great to see you. Good to see you, Bill. So, it's that, I guess Republicans, conservatives and then Fox News have made him scary. That's what he attributes his problems to.  MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. He doesn't need Fox News to make him scary. He is doing a really good job of it on his own. I mean, have you seen the Middle East in recent times, it's pretty scary.  Calling ISIS the jayvee team while they take over the territory the size of Great Britain. That's pretty scary. Paving the way for a Russian-Iranian alliance to take it, to push it out of the Middle East. That's pretty scary. So Barack Obama is doing a pretty good job of scaring the American people with his policies. They don't have to scary him personally.KELLY: What about that, Bill? I mean, he's got his policies that he will do well on or won't do well on. And now we have seven years, you know, to judge him on. What is it with, you know, it's something else, look at something else, it's not me. It's something else that you should look at to define any problems that have come my way?BILL BURTON, FORMER OBAMA WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: Well, Megyn, I don't think that that's what this conversation was about. It wasn't about what Barack Obama's problems are and where they were coming from, it was a conversation about Christianity and characters and books.  And, you know, the one quote that did not get read on the air just now is, you know, the President isn't just talking about one group of Christians, he's talking about a bunch of different groups of Christians. He even makes fun of liberal Christians for being wishy-washy on religion just right before the part that you read. So, I think the President is giving a wide ranging interview on a lot of different things. And that's just one part of the conversation.  KELLY: Well, that is the other piece of it, Marc, which is the religious people. How do you square being a person of deep faith when we all know that it's people of deep faith who are the most suspicious of others?THIESSEN: Yes, Barack Obama has this terrible habit of questioning the motives and morality of people who disagree with him. I mean, this is the exact same thing. He said he was reading this book in 2008. So, it's interesting that in 2008, it was when he said, quote, ""That the people, their concerns get bitter, they cling to their guns, religion or antipathy towards people who aren't like them."" I mean, this is a habit this president --  KELLY: That's the bitter clinger soundbites.  THIESSEN: Bitter clinger soundbites. But it's people who don't look like them. Conservatives aren't upset by Barack Obama because they don't look like him. They don't like people who look like him. They are upset with him because they think he's a terrible president. And they disagree with his policies, they don't think he's necessarily a bad person. They think that they disagree with the direction he's taking the country. He doesn't feel that way about conservatives, he thinks conservatives are bad people who don't like people who live different than they do. And he is basically accusing and calling them racist.  KELLY: What about that, Bill because there is about --  BURTON: Marc --KELLY: Yes, go ahead.BURTON: I was going to say to be clear the President didn't say anything about racism here, it was Marc who brought it up. Secondly, you know, I don't think that the President is just blaming his issues on other people. What the president is trying to do is have a conversation about different things. He's not questioning motives. He's talking about some perceptions. And so, I mean if you look at some of the people who are most identified with Christianity in public life. Just look at the presidential campaign, Ben Carson, here's a guys who says, a Muslim should not be president.If you look at Franklin Graham, here's a guy who says, 9/11 is because of homosexuality. If you look across the spectrum, yes, there are a lot of people very associated with highly religious views who do often get perceived as questioning folks who were different from them. The president isn't saying that all religious people don't like people who look different than them, don't like people who aren't the same religion than them. But what the President is saying is that there is often a perception issue that's worth talking about.  KELLY: Go ahead, Marc.  THIESSEN: He said specifically, they cling to guns, religion, antipathy towards people who aren't like them. In this interview, he said they are suspicious of those who aren't like them. How else am I supposed to read that, Bill? And by the way, this is not the only example of it.  In 2012, he said about conservatives said, if you are out of work, you can't find a job, you are on your own. You don't have health care you are on your own, if you are born in poverty, you are on your own. That's the republican view. It's not that we disagree about poverty and how to handle it, it's not that we disagree about how to improve the economy.He believes that Republicans are don't care about people, that they're selfish, bad people who don't care about their fellow Americans. He is constantly questioning their motives. I don't think Barack Obama is a bad person. I think he's trying to do what is best for the country. I think he is terribly wrong about it. He thinks that I don't care about the poor, don't care about people who don't have jobs, people don't care about who have an education. And it is scary to have someone in the White House who feels that way about it.  KELLY: And he thinks he wants dirty air and dirty water. Just a good measure. Don't forget that.THIESSEN: Yes. That's true.KELLY: Bill, you understand the messaging, because conservative Republicans feel that he's constantly attacking them and poking them and blaming them and condemning them. And then they think he plays the victim saying, I don't know why they're after me. And try to make me seem so scary, because I am very benevolent and perfectly willing to talk to these air hating, water hating, poor child hating people.BURTON: I want to get on the record and say that I do not think that Marc Thiessen hates air. I am sure throwing it out there right now.(CROSSTALK)But I will say.  THIESSEN: Bring it out, baby.BURTON: I will say that Marc is quite specifically taking something out of context. The President did not say folks are more suspicious. He was saying that there is this perception that they aren't. You know I think for the President to say that they are different world views is not, you know, it's not ground breaking, a ground breaking thing to say. I went back and I watched one of the President's speeches after he lost the New Hampshire primary. I was on this panel. And I wanted to go and look back at some of the things he had said. And one of things that struck me was that in his speech he said, you know what, Democrats and Republicans, all the candidates in this race, we share the same goals, which is to make America stronger, to make our kids smarter, to make sure that people can get an education for all their kids. But it's just that we have different means of getting there. And that's what I think gets lost in these conversations. People said --  (CROSSTALK)BURTON: Like all these things about perception, but it's worth knowing that that's where the President comes from, not you know, little snippets of these conversations that he's having.  (LAUGHTER)KELLY: Marc is looking look like -- do I get a chance? No, you do not. All right. Great to see both tonight.  BURTON: Thanks, Megyn.THIESSEN: Thanks, Megyn. Talk to you later.KELLY: Well, we also have breaking news tonight on Dr. Ben Carson -- yes, talk to you later. Then his big new poll numbers. Wait until you see the latest Fox News poll. And some ugly media attacks that have just surfaced. Chris Stirewalt and Howie Kurtz are next on how the candidate is handling both, and what it means for the 2016 race.  Plus, meet the woman who sued her 12-year-old nephew for rambunctious behavior. Arthur and Mark are here on whether the case has merit and what happened when a jury weighed in today.And then horrifying new details on how a passenger jet was shot down over Ukraine as investigators reveal what they think happened to 298 people inside and who they believe was responsible.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) The airplane broke up in the air.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Breaking tonight, new FOX polls on the GOP field show a big surge in national support for Dr. Ben Carson. He has gained another five points since last month and is now neck and neck with Donald Trump who is holding steady. But as Carson moves up, the mainstream media has ramped up the criticism finding controversy in what many feel are simple statements.  The latest involved Carson's answer to a question about the Bible.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SHARYL ATTKISSON, SUNDAY MORNING SHOW HOST, SINCLAIR: Do you think we're at the end of days?DR. BEN CARSON, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You could guess that we are getting closer to that. You do have people who have a belief system that sees this apocalyptic phenomenon occurring and that they're a part of it and who would not hesitate to use nuclear weapons if they gain possession.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Well, Dr. Carson appears to be referring to Iran. The Islamic State and their violent version -- vision I should say for ridding the world of infidels. But a number of media outlets treated the doctor like some sort of crazy street corner preacher. Salon writing, quote, ""Ben Carson's apocalyptic fantasies, we are getting closer to the end of days.""  Huffington Post, chides, ""Ben Carson believes Earth is getting closer to the end of days, but he still wants to be president."" CNN removes any context from its headline reporting, ""Ben Carson: We're Closer to End of Days.""Joining me now, Fox News digital politics editor Chris Stirewalt and the host of ""MediaBuzz"" right here on Fox Howie Kurtz. So, he was trying to talk about Iran Stirewalt and the takeaway was, he thinks we're all going to die! We're all going to die!CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: We're all going to die. The end is now. I called Kurt Cameron (ph) because the rapture is upon us. It's all about to happen. And it is one in a series, an ongoing series of stories about Ben Carson is a cook (ph). Ben Carson is a nut.  And you hear it. He doesn't talk like a politician. So he talks in -- he's talking around it. He is sort of meandering around. And he is not using soundbite language, so they're doing all these gotchas and then they're sort of getting themselves.  KELLY: Right. In their defense, Howie, he does make a lot of gaffes.  He gives a lot of fodder to the media who want to slam him.  KURTZ: I understand the controversy of Ben Carson talking initially about that advocating a Muslim president. I understand the controversy about him saying what he would do, confirm with a mass shooter, people misinterpreted that to say, he was blaming the victims in Oregon. This I don't understand at all. Because it's a straight forward question about faith, we just saw his answer. What the media utterly failed to grasp, Megyn, is that the more they whack Carson, painting him as a strange figure, the more it helps him. It's almost Trump-like because they don't understand his appeal.  KELLY: Do you think there is any consideration of that? They're not supposed to be considering whether their questions help or hurt him.KURTZ: Ohh!KELLY: They're not supposed to be.  KURTZ: I think they don't understand Ben Carson, they don't understand his appeal. He does speak in the language of faith sometimes and they feel like he's going to be sinking any time soon and they're just -- there is an effort by some in the media to paint him with some kind of a religious whacko who thinks the Apocalypse is eminent.  KELLY: Is it that far removed from what we saw from President Obama in the a-block of the show, Chris? It was like, those who really mean the faith -- and there is an implication that like he's a little --STIREWALT: And again, I also make a point that it was clear Ben Carson wasn't talking about the Southern Baptists. He wasn't talking about the united Methodists, he was clearly talking.  KELLY: Our friends in -- oh wait --  STIREWALT: Right.   KELLY: The people who chant ""Death to America.""STIREWALT: But if you don't understand, if you live your whole life in the -- if you had never been out of a stone's throw away from a good corned beef sandwich in your whole life, if you lived your whole life here, you have no idea what probably evangelical Christians think or believed.KELLY: Absolutely right.STIREWALT: You probably have no idea what people think about the end of the world, all of that stuff. And so, you just point and go, look at those weirdo cooks and Ben Carson is one of them.  KELLY: And follow up with, they're so intolerant.STIREWALT: Right.KELLY: They're the most intolerant people.STIREWALT: I hate how intolerant they are.KELLY: Howie, how closely is this tied to the fact that Ben Carson is starting to kill it in the polls? I mean, the FOX News poll that just came out, look at this. He's at 2003. He's up five. Trump's at 24, down two.  So they are neck and neck those two. And the next closest guy is Cruz who is up to, but he's at 10, 13 points behind Carson.KURTZ: Yes. Ben Carson was in single digits. Most of it this wouldn't be happening. The media would focus their attention elsewhere.  And of course, candidates that move up should get more scrutiny. But here's what's interesting, early on in this race Ben Carson said some dumb things, ObamaCare is equal to slavery, gay guys -- people to be gay when they go into prison.  KELLY: Prison makes you gay.  KURTZ: Yes. And he told me in an interview that he learned that to use that inflammatory language, people wouldn't hear his words and he would stop. Now he seems to have thrown this caution to the wind. His stop strategist was quote in saying, ""Let Carson be Carson."" I think he is embracing who he is. And some in the media don't like it. But clearly many republican voters do.  KELLY: The other thing we've seen, Chris is that Carson beats Hillary Clinton by the widest margin of any GOP running for president. He against Clinton in a Fox News matchup, 50 percent to 39. By the way, Hillary loses to every single republican, Carson, Trump, Bush, Fiorina, but loses the most to Carson.  STIREWALT: Yes. And she's a disaster right now. But the thing about Ben Carson, he is doing it exactly wrong, right? He is doing everything you're not supposed to do, he had no name identification, he had no organization, he started out with no dough, he followed none of the rules.  KURTZ: Very low key, doesn't speak in soundbites.  STIREWALT: Guess what happens. People reacts. They respond. They like him. It counts a lot to be liked and trusted. And what Republicans are saying is, we didn't know this guy before. The more he hear him, we like him, and they're going for it. And what's astonishing is, in the general electorate, his favorability ratings stay relatively high. People are not turning on him and it's not having that effect. How long this may last? I don't know. But right now he has defied gravity and defied every chattering head in the world who said he's going to do it.  KELLY: The Republicans say, the more you tell us that we're not supposed to like him, the more we do.STIREWALT: Uh-hm.KELLY: Great to see you both.KURTZ: Thanks, Megyn.STIREWALT: You too.KELLY: Well, a major milestone in the Freddie Gray case today out of Baltimore. And just ahead, we'll show you why all six officers charged in his death wound up in court together for the first time today. As Mark and Arthur weigh in on the big ruling that came down this afternoon.  Plus, CNN announcing it is taking a different approach to the democratic debate declaring the Democrats will be held to a different standard than the GOP.Media Research Center President Brent Bozell joins us next on how exactly that's going to work and why.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: I don't think this is a debate where you will going to have candidates attack each other.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, CNN admitting that it is taking a different approach with the democratic presidential debate than it did with the Republicans. In the first matchup, moderator Jake Tapper used his line of questioning to pit the Republicans against each other. Here's a little sample of that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAKE TAPPER, CNN CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Governor Christie, I want to ask you about something that Dr. Carson said the other day. Dr. Carson said, campaigning is easier for him, because he's not a politician, he can just tell the truth, therefore, while politicians, quote, ""have their finger in the air to see and do what is politically expedient.""  Governor Christie, tell Dr. Carson, is that a fair description of you?Senator Cruz, Governor Kasich says that anyone who is promising to rip up the Iran deal on day one as you have promised to do is, quote, ""inexperienced,"" and quote, ""playing to a crowd."" Respond to Governor Kasich, please.In an interview last week in Rolling Stone magazine, Donald Trump said the following about you, quote, ""Look at that face, would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?"" Mr. Trump later said, he was talking about your persona not your appearance, please feel free to respond what you think about his persona.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Anderson Cooper who was hosting tonight's matchup said a few days ago, he did not plan on following Tapper's lead.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)COOPER: I don't think this is a debate where you will going to have candidates attack each other. We have not seen that on the campaign trail.  I am always uncomfortable that notion of setting people up in order to kind of promote, you know, some sort of a faceoff. And then I think, look, these are all serious people. This is a serious debate. They want to talk about the issues. And I want to give them an opportunity to do that.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now Brent Bozell, the president of the Media Research Center. Brent, good to see you. So where is the controversy?  Anderson is going to do it differently than Jake did it. He's a different moderator. Isn't he doing what most viewers who watched that last debate wanted Tapper to do? Which is, don't just make it all about the dog fight?BRENT BOZELL, PRESIDENT, MEDIA RESEARCH CENTER: Yes, I mean, I don't mind what Jake Tapper did. First, what did he do? There were 74 questions that were asked. Fifty five of them were designed to get Republicans to fight with each other. Only one was designed to get them to respond to Hillary Clinton.  KELLY: Is that right, just one?BOZELL: I have no problem with that. But just one, just one. Fifty five and one. Remember those numbers, because I'd have no problem if tonight they did the exact same with the Democrats. If there were 55 questions designed to get them to squabble with each other and only one directed at the Republicans. You know that's not going to happen. Not only is it going to happen, Anderson Cooper said it's not going to happen.  And I love this. He says, I'm uncomfortable with the notion of setting people up in order to kind of promote some sort of a faceoff. He's got a problem with his own colleague Jake Tapper. Because that's who he is talking about.  KELLY: So that's his right. I mean, he's the moderator. Tapper is not. This is his ball game tonight. So, you know, he can play it the way he wants. But here's my question to you, his justification was, they're not going after each other like that, the GOP is the Republicans had been.  And I guess Tapper felt there was much more fodder to ask one about the other. Cooper is saying, these Dems have been sort of respectful of each other, so I don't have the ammunition even if I want to do it.  BOZELL: I don't think that Anderson Cooper has the right to, in a solo way decide what he's going to do on a network that has just done the opposite with Republicans. If CNN has followed one tact with Republicans, CNN has the responsibility to do the exact same thing with Democrats. If they want to go Oprah with Democrats, go Oprah with the Republicans. But here are the words that I think are just, this is just key here. He said I think talking about the Democrats, I think these are all serious people.  This is a serious debate. They want to talk about the issues. So, what do you think? The Republicans are in a serious party, they are not serious people. They don't want to talk about serious issues. That just smacks of elitism.  KELLY: Well, what about, how important is it that he try to draw distinctions between these Democrats running and President Obama?BOZELL: I think, I think tough questions and I mean I listen to the first few ones, tough questions are fine. All I'm asking, Megyn, is that both sides be treated equally. And I don't mean to be disparaging of Oprah. But you know what I mean, if you're going to have a conversation with one side, have a conversation with the other. If it's going to be hard hitting with one side, fine, be equally hard-hitting. If you're going to go Mike Wallace on one side, go Mike Wallace with the other. If you are going to ask tough questions about your opponents, ask tough questions on both sides.  KELLY: It makes sense. I mean, here at Fox News, we have a debate team. You know, Bret Baier, Chris Wallace and I are the team. And you will be seeing see us at the next republican debate that we're hosting.  And if they want to give us a dem debate, you will see us, too. And that allows for some consistency across the board. It's great to see you, Brent.  BOZELL: Thank you, Megyn.  KELLY: So just so you know, we are watching this debate for you.  Obviously, not everybody wants to watch it. If you would like to watch the breakdown of it. Join us tonight at 11:00 because we will have live coverage of what happened and the highlights and so on.And speaking of politics, this coming Thursday in a cable news exclusive, Charles Koch, yes, that Charles Koch, the guy, the Left loves to hate more than anyone else in this country it seems at times sits down with yours truly in a remarkable exchange. Here's a sneak peek.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Do you believe that the Democrats, including the President, have tried to make boogie men out of you and your brother David?CHARLES KOCH, BUSINESSMAN: Oh, definitely, that's a full-time job on their part. I mean, that's why I have never been that fond of politics and only got into it recently kicking and screaming.  KELLY: Why do you think they have been so relentless in their attacks? Harry Reid, your brother David pointed out, mentioned the Koch Brothers 289 times from the Senate floor, they have painted you as evil.  They actually put you, the White House actually put you on an enemy's list back in the 2012 campaign.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: The answer to that question and so many more. Mark it on your calendar. Set your DVRs as you won't want to miss this interview. Charles Koch on ""The Kelly File"" this Thursday, 9:00 p.m.  A big announcement from Planned Parenthood today, after a series of sting videos that appear to show the organization trying to make money off of the sale of fetal tissue. Something Planned Parenthood denied. But now they have changed a policy and we have that story, next.Plus, investigators shared some horrifying details today about exactly what happened when Flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine. We'll show you the report that is confirming the long held suspicions that Vladimir Putin and Russia may be directly to blame here.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Terrifying new details tonight on flight MH17, the commercial airliner shot down over Ukraine last year. Dutch investigators releasing their findings on the cause of that crash today, suggesting that the 298 people who were killed all by a handful likely they suffered unthinkable deaths. The dead included an estimated 80 children, mothers, fathers, grandparents, even some babies. And today, investigators illustrated their findings with an animation of what they think happened.A Russian made rocket exploding just outside of the cockpit, tearing the flight deck, right from the plane and killing three crew members, instantly. But it's what they say happens next that defies imagination. The blast sending a pressure wave throughout the plane just milliseconds later, causing debris to go flying, temperatures to plummet and creating Russia's air so powerful, it reportedly tore the clothes from people's bodies. Investigators estimate that some people could have survived up to a minute. Russia claims the report is biased. But if true, comments like these from President Vladimir Putin are likely to take on a whole new meaning.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHARLIE ROSE, ""60 MINUTES"" ANCHOR: Marco Rubio is running for the republican nomination. And he said that you were like a gangster.VLADIMIR PUTIN (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): How can I be a gangster if I worked for the KGB? Come on, that does not correspond to reality.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Trace Gallagher reports live from our west coast newsroom. Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, LOS ANGELES: Megyn, Dutch investigators reconstructed the entire front section of the Boeing Triple Seven, using recovered wreckage that was scattered from miles. The report concluded the impact pattern could only have come from a surface-to-air missile. And they believe it was a Russian missile, which is consistent with what the United States and the Ukraine believe. Animated video shows the missile exploding three feet from the cockpit, killing the flight crew and spraying their bodies with thousands of metal fragments. The force of the explosion tore away the cockpit and the floor business class, but the rest of the plane kept flying for another 5 miles. It's likely some of the 298 people on board either died quickly or lost consciousness, but many may have been fully conscious for up to a horrifying minute-and-a-half. The report was not intended to assign blame, except for the criminal investigation. But it does say the pro-Russian rebels were in charge of the area where the missile was fired. Here's the Ukrainian foreign minister.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PAVLO KILMKIN, UKRAINIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: Bringing such a highly sophisticated, extremely dangerous an air-to-missile system, you know (inaudible) is exactly for me, an example or affections which could be and should be created as an act of terrorism and (inaudible).(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Russia has now released a competing presentation, saying the type of missile described is no longer found in Russia's arsenal, and that it must have been fired from Ukrainian-held territory. The U.N. Security Council wanted to set up an international tribunal to investigate the disaster, but Russia vetoed that request; Megyn.KELLY: Trace, thank you.Also Breaking Tonight, the president of Planned Parenthood has now announced that the group will no longer take reimbursements as a part of the fetal tissue donation program. The change comes after a series of sting videos that appeared to show them profiting from the practice -- well, that was what the critics said, as doctors on hidden cameras negotiate price and discuss how to get more valuable samples. We have both sides tonight with us with the Family Research Council President Tony Perkins. And also, Nationally Syndicated Radio Host Richard Fowler. Good to see you both. And so Tony, what do you think that their decision, they're not stopping the donation program, they're stopping the reimbursement that they have been receiving for that fetal tissue says about Planned Parenthood?TONY PERKINS, PRESIDENT, FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL: I think they're in crisis mode. They know that Congress is on their tail, chasing them and they're hoping that this will throw Congress off, because they know better than anybody what Congress is liable to find if they continue with this investigation looking into what they're doing. Not unlike when I was a police officer, you'd be chasing a car, they would throw something out the window, hoping you would either stop chasing them or they wouldn't be caught with the goods. It didn't work for them. And I don't think it's gonna work for Planned Parenthood either.KELLY: Richard, that the group that was behind the sting videos comes out and said this, ""If the money Planned Parenthood has been receiving for baby body parts, were truly legitimate reimbursement, why cancel it?RICHARD FOWLER, NATIONALLY SYNDICATED RADIO HOST: Oh, I think what Planned Parenthood is trying to do here is the above board as they've always been and do the humanitarian work they continue to do. I think the question I have for Tony and I think a lot of question -- a lot of women are asking this question, what do you think Congress is going to find that Planned Parenthood had does mammogram screenings and does cancer screenings that they help people make life decision, regarding birth control and condoms and preventing the spread of STDs? Because that's what Planned Parenthood does each and every day from millions and millions of people.KELLY: Well Richard, Richard, if Planned Parenthood has no problem whatsoever with the investigation, then why don't they just welcome it? They have it.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: And they want the investigators come in, why have they objected so loud?FOWLER: Well, of course. That's exactly why you saw Cecile down on Capitol Hill last week for almost three to four hours, answering every question, because Planned Parenthood understands they've done nothing wrong here. This is some botched videos that were edited horribly.KELLY: But that...FOWLER: And those individuals who recorded those videos.KELLY: But that doesn't answer the question.FOWLER: Were not disputed to Congress.KELLY: Tony, you tell me. If they've done nothing wrong, then why are they cancelling the reimbursement? Why not just say, we've done nothing wrong? We're not gonna change a thing?PERKINS: Just a few weeks ago, she was proud of this. Now they're cancelling the reimbursions (ph) -- reimbursement. By the way, Richard, they don't do mammograms. They even admit.FOWLER: They refer.PERKIN: By the way, there are four.(CROSSTALK)PERKINS: At least four other areas where there is clear violations or could be violations which are criminal. And that is altering procedures in order to get these baby parts out, so they can.KELLY: That would be illegal.(CROSSTALK)PERKINS: They properly got consent. There is also the issue of partial birth abortion and even killing a born -- a child that's born alive. So there is a lot more questions.FOWLER: That is ridiculous.PERKINS: That Planned Parenthood has to answer.FOWLER: First, let --KELLY: All right.FOWLER: Megyn, let's talk about -- let's just talk about the record...(CROSSTALK)FOWLER: First of all, like we said.KELLY: Right.FOWLER: These videos were highly edited and everybody understands that. But number two.(CROSSTALK)PERKINS: They are not. They are authentic.FOWLER: Only three percent of the work that Planned Parenthood does even around abortion and abortion services. The other 97 percent is about making sure that women stay healthy and make healthy sexual choices. The hypocrisy here for me Megyn is astonishing. You look at Congressman Jason Chaffetz who -- they are adamantly against abortion. They're adamantly against partial birth abortion, but as soon as that baby is born, they will cut (inaudible), they will cut public education, they -- if all live.(CROSSTALK)FOWLER: If they really a pro -life.PERKINS: From Planned Parenthood.FOWLER: Let's talk about.(CROSSTALK)FOWLER: Let's talk about from cradle to great pro-life.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Go ahead, Tony, quickly.PERKINS: Look, we're talking about Planned Parenthood that has been caught in activity that appears to be illegal. Congress has a right because they're receiving over a half, almost a half billion dollars.KELLY: Right.PERKINS: Of taxpayer money.FOWLER: For health care, for more reproductive health care, not to abortion.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Well, It doesn't look like this is going to stop the investigation.(CROSSTALK)FOWLER: Not for abortion.PERKINS: Behavior.FOWLER: It's not for abortion. It goes for women's health.KELLY: Got it, got to go, OK. Well, well we also got big news today from the publishers of Playboy magazine. This is your nightly Playboy update. After more than 60 years of centerfolds, they are now going to focus on the news. The news -- the centerfolds are going away. And James Rosen, a special correspondent for this magazine -- yes, that's true, is here on that decision and what makes him so very special.Plus, Mark and Arthur are here on the major developments we just saw on the trial of the Baltimore six, plus the controversial case of the New York City woman who spent the day suing her 12-year-old nephew. And the pro-Confederate flag group that just got flapped with terrorism charges, that's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: A major milestone in Freddie Gray case today. All six officers charged in Gray's death appeared in court for the first time. At issue were some of the statements given by a couple of the officers to investigators about what happened on the day Freddie Gray was arrested. The defense argued some of those officers were tricked into making those statements, but today a judge ruled those statements are still admissible, so a setback for the defense.Mark Eiglarsh is a criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor. Arthur Aidala is a Fox News legal analyst and a New York trial attorney, great to see you both. So Mark, basically, this judge said that the statements by two of the officers in particular, including sergeant Alicia White can come in against her, even though her lawyer said one instance, she gave statements without about being micronized (ph), she wasn't given - - she wasn't read her rights.MARK EIGLARSH, FORMER PROSECUTOR: Yeah, I don't like this ruling at all. First of all, the constitution applies to everyone, including law enforcement officers. And I don't like the fact that these officers have to choose between their cherished fifth aimed right not to incriminate themselves and their livelihood, if you don't cooperate, you don't feed your family. That's not a freely and voluntarily relinquished right that took place. I just don't agree with this ruling.KELLY: That's the difficult position they were in, Arthur, because they are being asked questions, and are you being asked questions in your role as a cop who is an assistant to the prosecutor who might be charging Freddie Gray or somebody else, or are you the defendant?ARTHUR AIDALA, NEW YORK TRIAL ATTORNEY: Well, let's give credit to Officer Goodson or his or her attorney. His attorney, him or her, because he didn't speak, he's the only one of the six.KELLY: The driver of the van.AIDALA: Who is didn't say a word, so he's in the best position regarding that. You are in front of the judge who routinely his defense attorneys saying that their civilian complaint -- their civilian client was tricked by the police into giving a statement, and the judges routinely say, ""No, I don't believe that. I don't believe they were tricked. I am allowing the statement in."" So now how does the judge say and from two police officers who know the law better than civilians.KELLY: But they were in a different goal. The confusing thing for these cops, Mark, is that they were in a different role. They're sitting, they're answering questions about an incident, and they don't know whether they are a potential defendant in a criminal case or whether they are there as cops trying to assist in an investigation of a different case?EIGLARSH: Yeah, it's even worse. Officer White maintains I have no reason to disbelieve her that she was told that she was a mere witness. She was, ""ah, we just need to get your testimony or witness in this case."" And so she doesn't think that she has anything to worry about. That to me, while trickery has been upheld.(CROSSTALK)EIGLARSH: Because they allow do trickery on civilians. I know Arthur. In this case, it just smells.KELLY: Wait, I want to move one. We have another case here, so now apparently terrorism charges have been brought against a group that was waving a Confederate flag down in Georgia. Fifteen members of the group called Respect the Flag have been indicted. Tell us why, Arthur.AIDALA: Well there is -- first of all, there is a long grand jury. So this happened in July and this just came down. So that's a good thing. Time, it was no rush to judgment like there was in the Freddie Gray case. And apparently, there were threats. You are allowed to use words, but once it crosses that line into menacing, they were -- but someone said they heard something about guns, I'm going to shoot you and that's where a grand jury has ruled across the line.KELLY: And the n-word, too. But Mark, terrorism charges, why, how, how'd they get there?EIGLARSH: Well, ultimately that's what they call it in that state when you move from protected speech to fighting words. And it wasn't just saying the n-word because that's unfortunately, that constitutionally protected. And it wasn't just the flag, it was everything plus fighting words that the encouragement of committing crimes, violence, that's where they cross the line.KELLY: True fighting words are those meant inciting somebody to act immediately in a violent way. It's not just angry rhetoric, it's right now.EIGLARSH: Well, they were there in front of the house.(CROSSTALK)EIGLARSH: Sunday party. They were there.AIDALA: Someone's got survive (ph) they heard them say, ""We got a gun, go shoot the blank.""KELLY: OK.AIDALA: That's different than just expressing your opinion under the First Amendment.KELLY: Absolutely right. OK, here's the last thing and the most ridiculous. OK, that. Look at that. That Mark knows what case, we're getting to know. You tell us Mark, why are you doing that? In the case of this poor lady, poor, poor lady, a Manhattan HR manager who is suing her 12-year-old nephew for breaking her wrist at his birthday party when he turned 8.EIGLARSH: Because. Megyn, it's a money grab, that's why. Obviously, when you're holding an 8-year-old responsible for hugging you and hurting your wrist, a jury will always find that you are grabbing the money. You just know what they did.(CROSSTALK)AIDALA: It gives lawyers a bad name. My father told me (inaudible), ""No matter what, Arthur, you never sued someone in your own family under any circumstance.""KELLY: You father especially underscore that. And you know what the little man has said to her, when he bolted towards her to hug her? And she said Jen, I love you.AIDALA: Happy Birthday.EIGLARSH: Yeah, you know what Megyn?KELLY: If I might be I want to see a thousand times and then snap of your bones.(LAUGHTER)EIGLARSH: Megyn, if she could use.KELLY: I got to go.EIGLARSH: Your good hands to wave goodbye to the family relationship.(LAUGHTER)AIDALA: Mark really enjoyed this to us tonight.EIGLARSH: Yeah.KELLY: Great to see you both -- me too, me too.EIGLARSH: Thank you.KELLY: Coming up, we'll tell you about the surprising change that Playboy is making to give it a boost to its readership, special Playboy correspondent James Rosen is here next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Developing tonight, a dramatic announcement from Playboy magazine. After 60 years of centerfolds, the magazine says it is done with nude picture of women. The change means people will actually, really be reading the magazine for the articles. Joining me now, our own James Rosen, who is actually written several articles for the magazine and is so delighted that now finally (inaudible).JAMES ROSEN, SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT, PLAYBOY: First of all, I'm delighted to have you back in Washington, OK? Where you started out -- it makes me feeling like singing, frankly, a little.KELLY: Go for it.ROSEN: Welcome back. Your dreams were your ticket out.KELLY: Well, all right. That's (inaudible) of Sheryl Crow.ROSEN: Listen, she makes a fine president.KELLY: She sang the national anthem on before the democrat debate, it was a little rough.ROSEN: So yeah, I mean, I've written four times for Playboy since 2006. I've gotten that joke about reading a few articles many times. In a lot of ways, this makes sense because the media landscape has changed so dramatically since 1953 when Hugh Hefner started Playboy. And even from the late '70s when he really started to face competition from other.KELLY: What just happened? Do men no longer want to see nude women?ROSEN: Well, they can go to the internet to do it and for free.KELLY: Internet.ROSEN: Yeah. And in some ways, I hope that this will mean that playboy will tilt more toward the highbrow literary aspect that it is always has.KELLY: It has and it has been respected for its writing.ROSEN: And not tilt so much to that other stuff.KELLY: And so now, what does this mean? Their circulation is expected to increase because the stats say that they had 5.6 million in '75.ROSEN: In 1975, yeah.KELLY: Now the circulation is 800,000. So do they believe that they'll get those numbers back if they take rid of -- they take out the nudies?ROSEN: Apparently -- the nudies.(LAUGHTER)ROSEN: What year is this? Look, I said they have some internal data that show that people under 30 surged toward the magazine and toward the website once nudity was removed from the website in 2014.KELLY: Really?ROSEN: And so if they kept the nudity in, their numbers would skew towards 47, 48 years of age, so that brings them down into the 30s and that's desirable.KELLY: As great as your writing is, and I highly recommend it in any form. Book, article, whatever, did it ever feel weird to see all this great journalism you are doing, right underneath the picture of, you know, down south Rio, on a woman.(LAUGHTER)ROSEN: Only the.KELLY: Taking a trip down to Rio and there's James Rosen.ROSEN: Yeah. The -- down south to Rio.(LAUGHTER)ROSEN: Am I blushing, Tom, (inaudible)? Yeah, it was a little odd, but you know I also had my guy friends literally bowing down to me and saying, ""It's over. You're the king.""KELLY: Yeah, but you don't get to actually meet the women.ROSEN: I never met the women, I never met Hef, I've never been to the mansion, but I'm still a young man.KELLY: There's still hope. James Rosen, thank you, sir.ROSEN: Thank you, Megyn.KELLY: Specially (ph) Special correspondent. We will be right back. Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: We are live in D.C. tonight because today I had the honor of speaking at Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit. This year's theme is leading with purpose. And here with the very first question, host Patty Sellers asked me.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PATRICIA SELLERS, FORTUNE'S SENIOR EDITOR AT LARGE: What does power mean to you? What is that word mean to you?KELLY: I think it's synonymous with freedom, you know choices. I mean, I think one of the things that gives me power in my job is I don't need my job. I love my job. I would like to hold on to my job, but God forbid I got fired tomorrow, and I'd be just fine. And I would have said that eight, nine years ago when I was only a first or second-year, you know, reporter at Fox News. Because I like to hedge my bets and I like to make sure I have a few different options. So when I first started in television, if television fell through, I was going to go back to my legal practice and make use of my legal skills. And now, if I did or said something catastrophic that ended my television career tomorrow, I'd find something else to do. So for me, that empowers me to make the choices that are right for me and allows me not to let any one person, whether it's an employer or someone else I have to deal with, control me.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: By the way, I don't think I am getting fired. No one has said anything to me. I feel pretty good. I like being here. We ended by discussing my 4-year-old daughter Yardley who came with me on the trip, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: I said, you know where we're going, honey? We're going to the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit. And she said, ""Are we two of them?""(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)SELLER: Yes, you are. And Yardley, you are one of them.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Great moment. Hey, we'll have full coverage of the debate happening at the other channel at 11 o'clock this evening.

1	1	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/05/25/hillary-clinton-spars-with-press-benghazi-document-dump/	Hillary Clinton spars with the press; The Benghazi document dump	"This is a rush transcript from ""MediaBuzz,"" May 24, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.HOWARD KURTZ, MEDIA BUZZ HOST:  On the ""Media Buzz"" this Sunday, Hillary Clinton finally makes a few minutes for reporters but they fail to pin her down on subjects ranging from the Clinton foundation, to her private e-mail to her personal wealth.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Was there conflict of interest in your giving paid speeches into the run-up of your announcement that you're running for President?  HILLARY CLINTON, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIATE:  The answer to the question is no.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ:  Why was it so easy for her to finesse the questions?  And what about that Friday document dubbed of her Benghazi e-mails that was first leaked to ""The New York Times""?As Isis rousts the Iraqi army and captures Ramadi, much of the media debate focusing on finger pointing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And the brutal truth is that the Obama administration and the entire world have allowed the Isis savages to gain power and murder thousands of innocent people, thousands.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How do you deal with the fact that most of leadership of Isis today is people that were thrown out of the Iraqi military by U.S. policy?  How do you live with that?(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ:  But is this blame the other side approach doing any good as Isis grows stronger?  ABC keeping its $100 million man, George Stephanopoulos, in charge of its campaign coverage despite his failure to disclose those Clinton foundation donations but with suspended Anchor Brian Williams fighting for his NBC job, is the media increasingly coming under an ethical cloud.Plus, a Liberal getting heat for ripping the left for squashing free speech, why is Kirsten Powers taking on her own side?  We'll ask her.  I'm Howard Kurtz and this is ""Media Buzz.""It had been 28 days since Hillary Clinton took questions from media prompting Fox's Ed Henry to interrupt her event in Iowa.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON:  Wait. Yes -- maybe when I finish talking to the people here.  How's that?I might.  I'll have to ponder it.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ:  But the Former Secretary of State did break her silence fielding questions from five reporters in less than five minutes, such as this one on foreign government donations on the Clinton foundation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Your opponents say that the foreign donations and the private e-mails are examples of the Clintons having one set of rules for themselves and another set of rules for everyone else.  Do they have a point?HILLARY CLINTON:  I am so proud of the foundation.  I'm proud of the work that it has done and that it is doing and I'll let the American people make their own judgment about that.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ:  And the week ended with reporters plowing through her private e- mails on Benghazi after the State Department made them public.  Joining us now to examine the coverage, Chris Stirewalt, Fox's Digital Politics Editor, Susan Ferrechio, Chief Congressional Correspondent for the Washington Examiner and Mara Liasson of National Public Radio, a Fox News Contributor.  Chris Stirewalt, does it now look like, great god almighty, at long last, Hillary Clinton will be engaging the press?CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR:  No.  She won't and she doesn't have to.  These are the wages being paid to the political press corps for letting the Obama administration get away with a bunch of hogwash for the last seven years where they are going to tweet it and live stream it and talk to the woman who eats fruit loops in the bath tub and all of that garbage that they did and complained, it's Nixonian (ph), and it's abusive.  They went right along with it and this press corps apparently is going to continue to cover Hillary Clinton as if she were not smashing a grapefruit in their face every day.KURTZ:  I love the way how you tie GloZell Green the bath tub lady, friend of Hillary Clinton.(CROSSTALK)KURTZ:  All right, well Chris says she doesn't have to talk to the press but let's look at when she did talk to the press.  She took a few questions on Monday and two or three more on Friday.  Did reporters do their job when it came to pinning her down?SUSAN FERRECHIO, WASHINGTON EXAMINER:  How much of a job can they do if they don't have access to her?  That's the problem.  I was thrilled that Ed yelled out a question and forced her, basically, to deal with the press in front of the constituents and the cameras.  I think what Secretary Clinton is doing is she is talking to passed the media though.  And Chris touched upon that.  She was talking to the cameras, look at footage that got on the evening news, she sounded positive, she sounded jovial about the whole -- she was making light of the fact that the press never gets a chance with her and, you're right, she can talk past this now because of social media and other ways, youtube, to get at constituents, potential voters.KURTZ:  When there are just a few minutes is not really any chance for follow ups.  It is very easy to say well I'm so proud of the Clinton Foundation for it and basically ducked the questions.  On Friday, one reporter asked, what is your vision for Iraq?  Ok, like anybody who asked that should be sent back to journalism school, because it's just an invitation to recite talking points.  But my question for you Mara is do you agree that the media basically sort of pressured her into at least answering a few questions with the constant drumbeat of she's avoiding us, she's in the bunker, and she won't engage?MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO:  Yeah.  I think the media was right to insist that she talk to them and eventually she did because she had to.   She couldn't go forever and ever without talking to the press and, five minutes, what can you get down in five minutes?  She's very practiced as is everyone running for President.  She knows how to stick to her talking points and not give a whole lot.  She's in a unique position.  She's virtually unopposed, she doesn't have to give long, searching interviews because she's not feeling any pressure from anybody else.KURTZ:  I'm sure some people think this is just whining by journalists who always want more access from any candidate.  I'm not sure I buy the notion that she doesn't have to because, yes, she's going to get the apparent nomination even if she goes away for a year but I think it's really important for a candidate, including Hillary Clinton, to be seen as taking on questions, engaging the issues when Jeb Bush is doing it, when all of the Republican candidates are doing it, doesn't she pay some price if she is seen as just having antiseptic campaign with scripted events?STIREWALT:  Depending on what Republicans do, I doubt that it will work in the long run.  I think Mara's exactly right.  She can get through this primary because there isn't a primary so far.  In the long run, she's going to get herself into trouble but it isn't whining by the press.  What it is, it's consequential.  In this case, as we with the e-mails that were released, the questions here are enormous.  It's not that she doesn't want to answer these questions.  She cannot answer the question.  Sidney Blumenthal's involvement in profiteering in Libya on her Libya policy while paid by the foundation and holy crokanoe it's not that she doesn't want to answer it, there is no answer.KURTZ:  I'm glad you mentioned that because it says you know, for the sound bites, Sidney Blumenthal, of course old Hillary pal, former Clinton Whitehouse aid, barred from being hired at the State Department by the Obama administration, and yet has this back channel peppers Hillary Clinton with all kinds of e-mails on Libya while he is trying to do business in Libya with business associates.  That came up at the brief Monday press avail, I guess you'd call it.  Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Can you explain your relationship as Secretary of State with Sidney Blumenthal?  There's a report out this morning that you exchanged several e-mails.HILLARY CLINTON:  I have many, many old friends and I always think that it's important when you get into politics to have friends you had before you were in politics and to understand what is on their minds and he's been a friend of mine for a long time.  He sent me unsolicited e-mails which I passed on, in some instances, and I think that's just part of the give and take.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ:  Can you explain your relationship with Sidney Blumenthal?  The question didn't even include Libya.FERRECHIO:  No.KURTZ:  There was no attempt to sort of press her on the specifics.  It's difficult on the road, on the fly, but still.FERRECHIO:  On the road, on the fly, there's no time.  But the thing is, the media can still do its due diligence and be looking at this even if they can't corner her and get a long interview with her about this.   There's not been a lot of in-depth coverage.  The question is, as these e- mails come out piecemeal as we hear they're going to overtime, is the media going to keep looking into the e-mails that come out or are they going to drop this?  Is it going to become an old story?  Is the media going to essentially give her a pass on all of this over the long haul?  That's a huge question.  KURTZ:  I don't think they are going to give her a pass.  I do think some of this when you get into the Benghazi timelines and Blumenthal's role, it's complicated.FERRECHIO:  It's murky.  The press can't get into it because we're in this 140 character kind of world of reporting now.KURTZ:  By the way, those private e-mails from Blumenthal to Secretary of State Clinton, that story was broken by ""New York Times"" and it's also broke the private e-mail story which also worked in the Clinton Foundation story so what happened to the liberal media giving Hillary soft treatment?STIREWALT:  The ""New York Times"" is doing yeoman's work here.  Amy Chelsik and others are doing a great job of covering Hillary Clinton and basically treating her as a hostile witness because that's what she is.  And they are doing a great job.  Also, I think the decision, whoever's decision it was to leak to ""The Times"" in advance so it wouldn't just be a Friday afternoon news dump and go to the bottom of the sea was pretty good.KURTZ:  Treating her as a hostile witness?LIASSON:  I think.  What the Clinton campaign wants to avoid is what happened last time where there was so much hostility between the campaign and the press, it was just toxic.  Now I think it's incumbent upon her if she wants to have a successful campaign that she was accessible.  Don't forget, voters look at you and judge you as to whether you look authentic and real or whether you look like you're ducking every question.  Jeb Bush is making an actual point out of this, kind of showcasing his ability to take questions from anybody and not get ruffled, at least from ordinary people.  Sometimes he gets ruffled...(CROSSTALK)KURTZ:  Yeah.  The contrast with Jeb Bush who takes questions from reporters at almost every stop or at least almost every day is really striking.  What about the Friday document by the State Department on Hillary e-mails on Benghazi?  Susan used the word murky.  Some people saying well, it wasn't really covered, well of course a lot of people have tuned out for the holiday weekend but it was covered.FERRECHIO:  It was covered, it was hard to find...KURTZ:  Was it covered as a bombshell story?FERRECHIO:  Well, I didn't find a bombshell in there.  Maybe somebody else did.  I didn't find any smoking gun in there and I don't know if somebody will.KURTZ:  Let me move on to what I time to be a fascinating exchange with Senator Ted Cruz and of course is running for President with a Texas reporter for station KBMT and the subject was gay marriage, which Republicans often get asked about a lot and obviously public opinion is shifting on gay marriage, Ireland yesterday approving a gay marriage referendum.  If we can put it up on the screen, this Kevin Steele says, ""Do you have a personal animosity against gay Americans?""  Senator Cruz says, ""Let me ask a question.  Is there something about the left and I'm going to put the media in this category, that's obsessed with sex?  Why is it that the only question you wanted to ask concerns homosexuals?  Ok, you can ask those questions over and over again, I recognize that you're reading questions from MSNBC.""  Reporter asked again, ""Do you have a personal animosity against gay Americans?""Cruz says, ""Do you have a personal animosity against Christians, sir?""  Was the question out of line and what do you make of Cruz' response?STIREWALT:  I mean you're allowed to ask any foolish question you want.  I would say it would be fairly foolish to say of a person who has said on the record one bazillion times that he has no personal animosity towards gay Americans that sounds like -- talk about hostile kind of question.  That's a hostile question. But I think Cruz profits from it.  The reporter gave Cruz an opportunity to swing harder than he usually would and say, why are you such a weirdo?  Why are you creepy?KURTZ:  The senator went on to say -- talking about how he thinks that MSNBC is setting the template here.  Very few viewers are radical and extreme partisan outlet.  The only thing that surprised me is that Cruz is not a guy who seems to complain about his media coverage.  He knows a lot of reporters don't like him or what he stands for.  What did you make of that whole exchange?FERRECHIO:  I thought it really highlighted the focus that the media makes on social issues along these campaigns.  I saw this with Rick Santorum when he was running for President three years ago.KURTZ:  He used to complain a lot about not exclusively but predominantly about social issues in a way that some of his GOP rivals were not.FERRECHIO:  I think the same thing will happen with Ted Cruz.  He also said in that exchange, why are we not talking about foreign policy.  The frustration is that the media is focusing on these particular candidates, on their Achilles heel issues, like gay marriage or abortion, and excluding stuff of substance that those candidates would prefer talking about.LIASSON:  I think for Ted Cruz, who is focused on the primary only, this is probably a good tactic.  It's always good to bash the liberal media.  But I don't know, over the long term, if that's a fruitful strategy.  At some point you have to answer the question.  But for him, at right now, where he is in the polls this is fine.FERRECHIO:  If he answered the question, they would still keep asking.STIREWALT:  He let Mark Halperin off the hook for his racist interview.(CROSSTALK)STIREWALT:  But Cruz said, no problem, Mark, its ok, we all have a bad day.KURTZ:  Right.  If you missed it, it's at Bloomberg's Mark Halperin who asked Senator Cruz a series of condescending questions about his Hispanic culture, asked him to speak Spanish, what your favorite Cuban food, knowing well full that Ted Cruz doesn't claim to be fluent in Spanish and did not grow up in Cuba.  Let me get a break here.  Remember to send me a tweet @howardkurtz, comment on the show, the media, and the coverage of the campaign.Ahead, is ABC is paying George Stephanopoulos more than $100 million, does that explain why the network still backs him over the Clinton foundation mess.When we come back, that fall of Ramadi prompts plenty of media hammering over Isis, but is this the same old partisan debate?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ:  The fall of Ramadi this week is a huge setback on the war on terrorism.  Iraqi soldiers wound up fleeing the forces of Isis.  While there have been some good reporting on this turning point, some pundits are framing it as a question of which President to blame.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEAN HANNITY, HANNITY HOST:  President Obama and Hillary Clinton are responsible for the biggest betrayal of American troops since Vietnam.AL SHARPTON, POLITICS NATION HOST:  The rise of Isis is a very real consequence from the U.S. Invasion of Iraq.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ:  Susan, I feel like I'm back in 2003.  Are there too much partisan points scoring here?FERRECHIO:  Yes.  And I think part of the reason is -- first of all, it plays to everybody's -- whoever their -- Chris Matthews' viewers and Sean Hannity viewers to blame Obama or Bush.KURTZ:  They are playing to their base?FERRECHIO:  Of course.  But there's nothing to cover in terms of what to do next.  And that's because -- and what is missing here is the coverage of how Congress and the White House are unable and unwilling to come up with a real strategy for dealing with the crisis in the Middle East.  There's nothing to write about but there's also very little coverage other than the fact that they are not coming up with a plan.KURTZ:  ""The New York Times"" does have a story today asking Republican President what you would do about Isis and getting somewhat a vague response in many instances but that's precisely my point, which is, it's so easy to rerun the Obama versus Bush debate, it is so much more difficult and complicated and there are really no great options to talk about what do we do now, short of sending in ground troops, which is in the exception of Lindsey Graham and a couple others,, most politicians want to avoid that option too because it's not popular.LIASSON:  And there has been -- I did a story on this not long ago, and ""The New York Times"" today when you listen to Republicans, they are going to be tougher, they're going to kill more bad guys, and they wouldn't have let this happen.  But when actually kind of scratched the surface what would they do, pretty much the same thing that Obama has done but they would have done it earlier.  Maybe they would put advisors and more forwards positions but there's not a huge shift of strategy with the exception as you said of Lindsey Graham who is willing to put in ground troops.STIREWALT:  I think the Republicans' point of view -- it's not very politic to say but kill them in much larger volumes with many more bombs.  We're doing a limited number of missions, dropping very few munitions compared to similar conflicts in the past and the Republicans field say, smoke them.   Put the b-52s in the air and get serious about this.KURTZ:  We'll come back to the cable segments.  I've been watching Chris Matthews, as an example from MSNBC for two weeks and he's just going haywire, over Dick Cheney as he calls him and just fighting again about this is all Bush's fault.   And then I've heard a lot of conservatives say, well, if Obama hadn't withdrawn the last 10,000 troops although there was an agreement negotiated by Bush, he didn't want to keep the troops and it just seems like it is so much easier to look at the past than to deal with the present.STIREWALT:  We have a system that's based on conflict between two parties to solve problems.  And I'm ok with that.  And the two parties disagree about whose fault it is and which way forward.  That's why we have elections.  The real question here is for the Republicans and Democrats alike, was it worth it?  The 4500 dead, was it worth it?  The tens and thousands with traumatic injuries to their bodies and their brains, was it worth it?  And they don't want to answer that question because the answer is it depends on what we do now.KURTZ:  And this is an outgrowth of the now famous Jeb Bush, if you knew what you know now which you didn't know then would you invaded with Megyn Kelly and then Marco Rubio stumbling a bit over the same question with Chris Wallace.  I have some people, e-mailing and tweeting and saying this is a gotcha question.  No, it's not, maybe a hypothetical but it's not a gotcha question.  FERRECHIO:  You'll never know how they would act in the past to determine how may act -- it's very important for reporters to ask that question.  The story is not being covered, I will argue, is that the parallelization of the White House and Congress and the inaction about coming with a plan that works going forward.  They both have gotten silent on this because its political kryptonite and they don't want to touch it.KURTZ:  It's so much easier to go to the default setting of the media which is blame the other guy.  Mara Liasson, Susan Ferrechio, and Chris Stirewalt, thanks very much for stopping by this Sunday.Ahead, the left accused of squelching free speech by life-long Liberal Kirsten Powers, we'll talk to her.And up next, the top anchors at ABC and NBC, both under an ethical cloud.   What are the problems of George Stephanopoulos and Brian Williams tell us about TV news.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ:  Maybe now we know why ABC has staunchly defended George Stephanopoulos despite his failure to disclose that $75,000 in donations to the Clinton Foundation.  A New York Post reports that the network is paying the anchor more than 100 million.  This, despite ABC's Chief Anchor admitting he screwed up.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS CHIEF ANCHOR:  I should have gone the extra mile to avoid even the appearance of a conflict.  I apologize to all of you for failing to do that.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ:  But at MSNBC which totally ignored the story on the day it broke, Morning co-host Mika BrzezinskI has a different view.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC HOST:  He worked on the Clinton campaign.  He worked tirelessly to elect Bill Clinton.  He served under Bill Clinton.  Who would be so surprised that he has ties to the Clintons?  Everybody on television has biases.  I think the important thing here and what was lost here was the lack of transparency.  We all have to be -- look at Joe and me, totally different world views, totally different ideology.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ:  Joining us now for the ZBlock is David Zurawik, Television and media critic for the Baltimore Sun.  I thought I was one of the toughest critics out there on this subject but you wrote, ""George Stephanopoulos is dead to me.""DAVID ZURAWIK, BALTIMORE SUN MEDIA CRITIC:  Well, Howie, here is what is upsetting.  First of all, when we have to go to Mika Braginsky for moral clarity on media news, we're all in trouble.  (CROSSTALK)KURTZ:  She said just be transparent about -- but this is what she and Joe Scarborough is not anchors, news anchors.ZURAWIK:  That's what I'm saying, she's clearer than these guys about it.   She has a clear view.  This is the upsetting thing about Stephanopoulos.   He says I should have gone the extra mile.  No, you should have gone the first mile, for god's sakes, and disclosed this thing.  It's so obvious.KURTZ:  And not donated in the first place to the family foundation of your ex-boss.ZURAWIK:  But if you did, you should have told your viewers.  You should have been square with them.  That's what is so maddening about this.  This is a guy who's supposed to be so smart and I sat here with you and said how smart I think he is.  And yet he's so ignorant about this that he can say it was a matter of pub electric record.  By the way, it wasn't a matter of public record unless they disclosed it and there were some things that the Clinton's didn't disclose in this so this outrageous.  Now, where I'm at and where I think the real problem lies, Howie, is, you're right, in asking about that salary, it's totally about him.  When I say dead to me, I think in a political commentator, political reporter/anchor, he's dead to me.  I don't want to hear what he has to say to me anymore.  I'm 2016 election.  I think he's so poisoned.  Any belief I would have in his work -- and people are saying, oh, Zurawik, you're wrong.   He's going to err on the other side.  I don't care.  That's not the way it's done.(CROSSTALK)KURTZ:  I can't verify this $105 million over seven years, but even if it's two-thirds or half of that, to me I think ABC's problem to Stephanopoulos is too big to fail.  On the reaction, 46 percent of the new (Inaudible) polls say they want Stephanopoulos banned from campaign coverage.  He pulls out of the Republican Presidential debate, it will be carried by ABC but then how can he leave the network's 2016 coverage, interview Presidential candidates, especially including Hillary Clinton?ZURAWIK:  Howie, that's exactly my point.  If ABC news wanted to behave ethically on this and not lose him, they should have said, you're out of the 2016 campaign.  We can't have you as the face of our coverage.KURTZ:  How do you even do that when the guy is the co-anchor of ""Good Morning America"" and politics is going to come up everyday?ZURAWIK:  Then they have to shift it and let the other anchor or somebody else or put a reporter out there on the desk and let him read those nice things where they do to videos where like a lion chases a car because that's what George's career has come to if he can't quit being a Clinton partisan.  Howie by the way, you know that's exactly what it looks like is.   I'm angry I said in the piece you pointed, I'm angry because I gave him the benefit of the doubt for years.  You know, I said this guy can do it, Diane Sawyer became a fair journalist I think, why can't he.  And he just showed his stripes.KURTZ:  He worked very hard for 18 years I think to establish himself as a journalist and unfortunately I think he undid some of that.  Let me get into this, you've got ABC Chief Anchor apologizing, you've got Brian Williams at NBC on suspension fighting for his job, probably decision would be made in the coming weeks whether he gets to come back.  What do these and other episodes do to public confidence in television news?ZURAWIK:  Howie, I think it's awful.  I think the same people, who are angry, you know, you use the term ""too big to fail.""  In 2008, there's a lot of bitterness, distrust, pessimism, I think, even despair in America because of what happened in 2008 and nobody on Wall Street was punished in a meaningful way.  Too big to fail, now we look at these anchormen who behave -- it is ethics 101.  There's no gray area.  What they did was so bad they should be punished.  If they are not punished, people look at those networks news institutions and say the same thing.  It's all rigged.   The rich people get away with everything.  They are not on my side.  They are playing for this or that.  They are part of the 1 percent.  Why should I trust them?  Now, if somebody else comes along in news and convinces the audience that they are getting them the straight stuff, they are going to kill ABC news this year.KURTZ:  I would argue it doesn't just hurt ABC, it doesn't just hurt NBC, and it hurts all of us because they look at us as a bunch of insiders who are too cozy with politicians and maybe make too much money.  We'll see you in a bit David.Coming up next, some on the left trying to squash free speech, that charge not coming from a right winger but from Fox's Kirsten Powers.  She's next.And later, why are the critics giving David Letterman so many wet kisses as he bows out.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ:  The title makes it sound like an attack from the right but it's written by a life long Liberal.  Kirsten Powers' new book is called ""The Silencing: How the left is killing free speech.""  I sat down with her here in studio 1.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ:  Kirsten Powers, welcome.KIRSTEN POWERS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to be here.KURTZ:  Does it pain you as somebody who spent a lot of time in Democratic politics to be attacking the illiberal left, are you resigning from the left?POWERS:  No, because I do make a distinction between what I call the illiberal left and what I would consider just your average Democrat or another liberal who -- I may share the policy views of many of the liberal left.  I don't share the view that it's -- that you should silence people who disagree with you.  That's where I make the distinction.KURTZ:  But some of your friends and allies cannot be happy.  You've written a book on ""The attempt to silence descent from the Liberal world view"".POWERS:  Yes, there are people that are unhappy but I have to say most of the people that are making the criticisms have not read the book.  It's quite clear by the accusations that they're making they're saying, oh this is a book about how conservatives are being silenced.  It's actually not a book about how conservatives are being silenced, Conservatives are some of the people, and evangelicals are some of them.  A lot of the people that I profiled in the book that I interview are liberals who themselves have been experiencing silence or liberals are very concerned about what they consider the silencing going on there are politically agnostic people, they're not even people who are trying to get into the political debate.KURTZ:  Is this hard for you?  You're taking on your own tribe.POWERS:  Yeah, as you know Howie, I typically I try to call it the way I see it.  Did I think twice about writing this book?  Absolutely but when I really looked at the overwhelming evidence, what I saw was a very serious cultural trend that I think is very damaging to the country and I think it's illiberal and I think somebody needs to say something about it.KURTZ:  Some media outlets are not going to have you on let's talk about it.POWERS:  I have not been invited on a variety of media outlets.KURTZ:  Now liberals sometimes challenge you just for being a part of Fox News.  You mentioned in the book, Gloria Steinem and others, what do they say?POWERS:  I recall a conversation with Gloria Steinem where we were at an event and she basically just leaned over and said, you know, why do you go on Fox News?  And I don't remember what my answer was but she just said it's coming at such a great cost.  And I said, you know, I disagree.  I think you should go on.  I think people should get the whole picture of you and not just the stereotype.KURTZ:  And you wrote about the lefts war on Fox News and the media writing about Fox Babes, a Huffington Post headline, Megyn Kelly, attractive looking blond anchorwoman leads the pact at Fox News.  What do you make of that?POWERS:  What's interesting about that is they were linking to a ""New York Times"" profile about Megyn Kelly that did not in any way make that case about her.KURTZ:  Very positive.POWERS:  It was a very positive profile about her as a journalist.  The fact that they took a quote out of the entire very positive profile shows that is what they are reducing her to.  I don't think there's anything wrong saying women are attractive.  I have no problem with that.  It's when people try to use that as a sort of dehumanizing tactic to just dismiss somebody.  And that's what I talk about with the liberal left that you see them doing with women that they disagree with that they don't like.KURTZ:  You said that years ago, you kind of fell in to this trap that you originally saw conservatives and religious people as stereotypes and you talk in the book about what happened when George W. Bush nominated his White House lawyer Harriet Miers to the supreme court and you thought?POWERS:  I had this conversation with somebody at Fox News and I said -- it wasn't that great that he chose a woman?  And I said she doesn't really count as a woman choice because she's conservative and she's an evangelical.  And I'm very embarrassed to admit that now but that's a very commonplace view and I chronicle along with what I call the illiberal feminist which is people who say they care about misogyny and dehumanizing and dismissing women while at the same time saying that a conservative woman is not actually a real woman.KURTZ:  Some might say for a liberal to write about how the left is killing free speech, and you have a lot of examples in the book, does that mean that you've become more conservative a little bit while at Fox or trying to fit in more at Fox?POWERS:  No because it's not about ideology or policy or whether you're a Democrat or not.  It's about the fact that there are a group of people, like I said, I may agree with on policies.  I just don't agree with them on how they're stifling free speech.  So it is purely about trying to encourage a robust debate and calling out people who I just don't consider -- first of all, they are not the majority.  This is a very minority kind of mob situation where they have a lot of influence.KURTZ:  Or either high profile or activists and we say have outside influence.  It sounds to me like you're trying to say oh there is just a group over there but it also sounds like you make the case that this mindset, not only do I disagree with what you say but I don't want you coming to my campus to say it has infected...POWERS:  No.  It's absolutely very influential people and what I'm saying is that if you talk to most Democrats, just find a Democrat on the street and tell them about this or even a liberal and tell them about the situation, the things I'm talking about in my book, they would say, I'm not ok with that.  I don't think that that's ok.  On these campuses you will see, it'll just be a handful of people who will get upset about something and make so much noise and then everybody sort of caves to this because they don't want to be seen as allowing somebody on campus who is creating - - making it unsafe for other students even though most students probably wanted to hear that person and that's what you see in a lot of the interviews that I do.  That most people are saying we actually can handle this.KURTZ:  All right.  Well the book is already on ""The New York Times"" best seller list, obviously there's an audience for what you're saying even though you're taken somebody -- Kirsten Powers, thanks very much for sitting down with us.POWERS:  Thanks, Howie.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ:  Ahead on ""Media Buzz,"" Anderson Cooper tries to correct a falsehood and ends up on his own ""Ridicu-list.""But straight ahead, James Rosen on the challenge of pouring over Hillary's Benghazi e-mails and how they were leaked.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ:  Journalists have finally gotten a look at some of Hillary Clinton's private e-mails, those having to do with Benghazi after State Department officials released them Friday afternoon.  I checked in with James Rosen, Fox's Chief Washington Correspondent at the State Department.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ:  James Rosen, welcome.JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Thanks, Howie.  Good to be with you.KURTZ:  About a third of these Hillary Clinton e-mails on Benghazi had been leaked to the ""New York Times"" today earlier.  Did that blunt the coverage of the State Department release, made it seem a little less newsworthy?ROSEN:  To some extent it did because of some of the details, perhaps some of the most sensational details if we can call any of them sensational appeared yesterday and were widely reported by ""The New York Times"" and other outlets and so perhaps there have been some speculation that perhaps it wasn't the Benghazi committee that leaked the documents to ""The New York Times,"" as many people have suggested, but rather the Clinton team to lessen so as to blunt the impact.  Of course, there's no better way to blunt the impact of the documents than by dumping them out on a Friday, as you well know.KURTZ:  On a Friday Memorial Day Weekend.  What was it like for you as a reporter given the magnitude of this document done to spend Friday plowing through these e-mails?ROSEN:  Well, it was tough.  Because you had 296 e-mails to try and get through, they were released at 12:30 p.m. sharp on Friday eastern time.   And so you had all of these reporters, hundreds of reporters assaulting this website trying to get at them and trying to discern little interesting nuggets.KURTZ:  Assaulting this website, you make it sound like the landing at Normandy.ROSEN:  Well, the pressure was on, for sure.  Another interesting fact is that as I on Friday was uploading little interesting nuggets that I was taking out of the documents occasionally on twitter, you even had interaction between reporters.  I was the first to break the fact that the documents revealed that three days after the Benghazi attacks, Hillary Clinton slept through an appointment where she was supposed to receive the President's daily brief, it's the most sensitive classified intelligence document that the intelligence community produces and alerted her staff to this fact by typing out an e-mail at 10:43 in the morning saying, I just woke up, so I missed Dan, Dan was the aid with the Presidential daily brief.  I reported this and Josh Gerstein of Politico tweeted me back to say well, that was a Saturday.  I don't think it mattered much but it's interesting the interaction among the media as the story was unfolding.KURTZ:  I love that, a little bit of color.  So Benghazi has been pretty heavily investigated.  Is it possible that media expectations that there would be some kind of smoking gun, e-mail, perhaps inflated a bit too high?ROSEN:  I'm not sure that there really ever was such an expectation on the part of the news media, Howie, principally because we learned on March the 3rd of this year, that Hillary Clinton maintained all of her e-mails on a private and that she had deleted roughly half of them because she, of her own accord and by herself, had determined that roughly half of them were personal in nature.KURTZ:  Sure.ROSEN:  So the working supposition of the media has been that whatever we would see might have been subjected to that same kind of sanitizing process.KURTZ:  Before I let you go, you're a big twitter aficionado.  President Obama joining twitter this week, quickly got 2 million followers I'm sure it's more than that by now.  Tweeting under his own name is this serious strategy to engage with the folks or is it kind of a stunt?ROSEN:  Well, I would be remiss if I didn't begin my answer Howie by alerting your viewers to the fact that you can all follow me on twitter @jamesrosenfnc.  It has to be done.  It has to be done.  As for @potus which is the President's new twitter handle, he previously has been on twitter as @barackobama that was a campaign handle.  Very quickly, this engendered a comment from Former President Clinton, just wondering he said hashtag, asking for a friend if the @potus handle will stay with whomever becomes President.  I think it's not going to make that much of a difference in terms of the communication strategy of the White House but it follows a long lineage dating back you might say to Richard Nixon playing the piano on the Jack Par show, throughout all points in the last 50, 60 years, politicians have been rushing to make use of the latest means of communication and often it's informal and outside of what we conventionally think of as political.KURTZ:  Exactly, one sad note is that a lot of tweets and reactions to the President were violent and racist in nature reminding us that tweeter can also be a very rough neighborhood.  James Rosen thanks for joining us from the State Department.ROSEN:  Thank you, Howie.KURTZ:  After the break, David Letterman getting a standing ovation from the media as he signs off but what of his impact on the culture wasn't all that positive?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ:  The critics have just showered David Letterman with praise, way over the top on in my view during the run-up to his final CBS show.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID LETTERMAN:  I'll be honest to you.  It's beginning to look like I'm not going to get The Tonight Show.  I want to thank the folks at home.   People come up to me all the time and they say Dave, I've been watching you since your morning show and I always say have you thought about a complete psychological workout?  The people who watch this show, there's nothing I can do to ever repay you.  Thank you for everything.  You've given me everything.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ:  Baltimore Sun's David Zurawik is back with us.  You say Letterman is a brilliant performer but that he infected the culture with irony and snark, which to you is like something of a disease.ZURAWIK:  Well it is a disease, you know young people that's all we have is irony and snark and we believe in nothing.  Earnestness is mocked, seriousness of purpose is mocked.  I really do I think it's a really kind of cultural malaise and I think he's part of it.  To blame David Letterman for it would be ridiculous.  (CROSSTALK)ZURAWIK:  You'll find a way Howie I know you.  It's all they have.  You know, look at social media.  It's filled with it.KURTZ:  You also say that the Letterman show which obviously went through a lot of changes from the 80's to the current version that ended this week.   Giving baby boomer men a way to be silly or stupid and think they were cool.ZURAWIK:  You know well that's not so bad.  I can live with that.  We all love our pets but I'll tell you what really troubled me about Letterman, he really led the charge in this.  Politicians being able to bypass the press and go to the late night couch and talk directly to the people.  I think that's a really bad development.  You know, it started on Arsenio Hall in 92 with Clinton on the sax phone.  But he is the guy that pushed that.  KURTZ:  I disagree with you on this.  Because yes, they all do it now, and the current crop does it.  But with Letterman who's unabashedly liberal, he could have an intelligent political conversation with a John McCain or a George W. Bush or a Bill Clinton, and I think that the current crop, they're talented guys but Jimmy Fallon slow jams the news.  They're not having those kinds of conversations.  Nobody wants to do that...(CROSSTALK)ZURAWIK:  So he did it better than them Howie.  I'll grant you that and had a more intelligent conversation but this is what we're left with now.  But also with that, I think in one sense it places the political discourse in an entertainment box instead of in the serious box of public affairs.  Also it keeps unruly nasty reporters, honest reporters from asking hard questions.KURTZ:  Right but it also lets politicians communicate with people who are not regular watchers of Sunday shows, don't watch a lot of news.  You have to go where the people are.  I mean I don't think -- you're hanging a lot on Letterman's name.ZURAWIK:  I'm not saying it's all Letterman but he made that successful.KURTZ:  You should stay off and only talk to news anchors.  I got you silent for a second.  I think Letterman is a very talented guy.  I think he's been a tad over praised when you consider for over these years he was number two to Jay Leno but the media elite, loved him, the liberal elite loved him, they kind of looked down on Leno.ZURAWIK:  Absolutely.  That was a result of this narrative after he didn't get The Tonight Show, that Dave is the hip, edgy, daring guy.  Jay is the corporate hack who just only says whatever is safe.  You know what?  David Letterman is as much of a corporate hack.  Anybody who gets a network talk show is not a radical.  You know what I'm saying?  You're not going to take on capitalism and get a network nighttime talk show.  That's the way it works.  That was the difference.  Everybody did it.  All the baby boomer male critics, and we were part of the time when all the critics were baby boomer men bought into that and they loved Dave, they mocked Jay.  I think it was really unfair.  I really do.KURTZ:  It was not emotional finale but then again, Dave is not a weepy guy. You're not holding back.  David Zurawik thanks again for joining us.   Still to come your top tweets, TLC cancels a program over a sex scandal and Anderson Cooper tweets his way into embarrassment.  Buzz worthy is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ:  What a tragedy.  After the magazine In Touch reported allegations that Josh Duggar as a teenager molested a number of young girls.  TLC promptly yanked his reality show, 19 kids and counting.  Duggar apologized for having acting inexcusably and resigned from the conservative Family Research Council.  Now MSNBC, the Washington Post, and others pointing out that Duggar had posed for pictures with some Republican Presidential candidates.  Well obviously didn't know about this.  This is not a time for piling on.  TLC did the right thing in saying it's deeply saddened and troubled by this heartbreaking situation.  Check out our digital down load on our homepage.  This week we're looking at snap chat, once a phone app for teens taking naughty selfies now getting into the political coverage business with some big name media partners.  Your top tweets Should Hillary Clinton answer more questions from the press or does it not matter?  TWEET:  If it doesn't matter for her campaign, then how will it matter if she's elected?  The media has done little to access Obama.TWEET:  Responding to questions to media only matters if the answers are truthful and factual.TWEET:  She's brilliant.  She can make the media cover her and almost say nothing, no media asking stupid questions can't screw up.KURTZ:  When I see false stuff about me on Twitter which happens often, well I usually just let it go but Anderson Cooper couldn't believe he was quoted as saying at an NYU commencement speech that graduating is a bigger deal than scoring a hole in one in gold, especially since he never gave a speech at NYU.  So the CNN Anchor tweeted at the source, ClickHole did you make this stuff up?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's when everyone on planet earth helpfully pointed out that ClickHole is a comedy site run by the same satirical geniuses who produce the onion.  Some people say the name of the site, ClickHole should have been my first clue.  Yeah I know, it should have, shouldn't it.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ:  Well at least he got a clue.  Good for Anderson for laughing at his additional cluelesness.  That's it for this edition of Media Buzz.  I'm Howard Kurtz.

Another Politician Gets Caught With a Resume Problem

"	"Friday Follow-UpIn today's Friday Follow-Up, we told you this week about a recent string of resume-boosting by politicians. Now the conservative Weekly Standard contends, even as he criticizes his Republican opponent Mark Kirk, Illinois Democratic Senate candidate Alexi Giannoulias should be added to the list. His official campaign biography claimed Giannoulias: ""founded and chairs the AG Foundation -- a not-for-profit charity that donates money to treat child-related illnesses, curb poverty, and assist disaster relief organizations."" But the Standard reports the charity no longer exists and was only in existence from 2005 to 2006. The candidate's website has since updated ""chairs"" to past tense ""chaired.""Say Say Say You're SorryHouse Minority Leader John Boehner wants Paul McCartney to apologize to the American people for taking a swipe at former President George W. Bush.During Wednesday's concert at the White House, the former Beatle said: ""After the last eight years, it's good to have a president that knows what a library is.""Boehner tells Human Events: ""I was surprised and disappointed by the lack of grace and respect he displayed which demeaned him, the White House, and President Obama.""Communication BusinessPolitico reports there is another jump from the media to politics. ABC News deputy political director Teddy Davis says he's leaving the network to join the communications and politics team at SEIU, the Service Employees International Union. Conservative outlets are citing the move as another example of a liberal media bias. Imperfect CallMichigan lawmakers are going to bat for Detroit Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga. His bid for a perfect game ended Wednesday on a bad call by an umpire. Senator Debbie Stabenow is asking the Major League Baseball commissioner to nullify the call and award the perfect game. Congressman John Dingell says he will introduce a resolution in Congress calling for the same thing. And Governor Jennifer Granholm has already issued a proclamation declaring it a perfect game.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.HOWARD KURTZ, HOST: On the buzzmeter this Sunday, the press hammering Donald Trump for weeks over his comments about women, now seizing on his stumbles on abortion.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What I was asked as a hypothetical -- hypothetically -- hypothetically, the laws are set now on abortion and that's the way they're going to remain until they change.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Many commentators also bashing the billionaire for defending his campaign manager against a legal charge of grabbing reporter Michelle Fields.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)TRUMP: I'm not a lawyer. She said she had a bruise on her arm. I mean to me, if you're going to get squeezed, would you think that she would have yelled out or screamed or something?SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS: I got to be honest, I looked at this tape at least 100 times today to try and see, and I have her original statement here that she was ""jolted backwards and somebody grabbed me tightly by the arm, yanked me down. I almost fell to the ground."" Now, I'm showing the tape. I don't see that.RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC: Now that we have this huge tape, the argument from the Trump camp that is no longer that the campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, never touched the reporter Michelle Fields. Now, their argument is ""hey, the touching wasn't that bad.""(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: With two days until Wisconsin's primary, are the pundits finally getting payback against Trump? And, with all the tabloid charges and countercharges, are media covering the campaign's dissent into the gutter or helping to push it there?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)KENNEDY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: I think there's something really compelling when you have people who are seeking that much power and who can really affect your daily life, when there are tabloid accusations made about them because usually, you know, when we talk about tabloids, we're talking about distraction.ANDREA TANTAROS, FOX NEWS: I think it points to a culture that's pretty coarsened and pretty eroded. And this political season is reflective of that, Howie.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: My conversation with the ladies of Outnumbered. Plus, more negative headlines for Hillary Clinton in the e-mail probe and Bernie Sanders on a winning streak. Is the press again treating this as a real contest? I'm Howard Kurtz and this is ""MediaBuzz.""The coverage of Donald Trump heard harshly negative this week after Florida police filed a misdemeanor battery charge against his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, for grabbing Michelle Fields. The campaign says Lewandowski is completely innocent. But the story has been fueled by a new security video and Trump's criticism of the former Breitbart reporter.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Look what she says. Michelle fields --- and who by the way, she's not a baby, okay -- in her own words, exactly, I was jolted backwards. Well, she wasn't. I mean she is standing there. Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm. Tightly, and yanked me down. She wasn't yanked down. She didn't even have any expression.ANDERSOON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: It doesn't concern you that initially (INAUDBLE) he said I never touched her? And that turns out not to be true.TRUMP: He admitted. I don't think he knew her.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Well, the next day, MSNBC's Chris Matthews pressed Trump on his pro- life stance and there was this eye popping exchange.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC HOST: Do you believe in punishment for abortion, yes or no as a principle?TRUMP: The answer is that -- there has to be some form of punishment.MATTHEWS: For the woman.TRUMP: Yes, there has to be some form.MATTHEWS: Sentenced 10 years, what? (ph)TRUMP: I don't know. That I don't know.MATTHEWS: But why not?(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: The campaign was still cleaning that up when Trump said this in an interview that aired today with CBS's John Dickerson.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: What I was asked as a hypothetical -- hypothetically. Hypothetically. The laws are set now on abortion and that's the way they're going to remain until they change.JOHN DICKERSON, CBS NEWS: There are a lot of laws you want to change. You've talked about them and everything from libel and torture. Anything you want to change ...TRUMP: At this moment, the laws are set and I think we have to leave it that way.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: The Trump camp also rushing to clarify that statement. Joining us now to analyze the coverage is Amy Holmes, news anchor at The Blaze, Kirsten Powers, our Fox News analyst and columnist for USA Today, and Susan Ferrechio, chief congressional correspondent for The Washington Examiner.Amy, that exchange between Donald Trump and Chris Matthews on abortion, if it were illegal, then women should be punished and he basically retracted that quickly. It's been an explosion of media coverage. It's been an explosion of media coverage around that. Is that fair?AMY HOLMES, THE BLAZE: I think it is fair and I have to give Chris Matthews credit for really pressing Donald Trump on the question. I've interviewed Donald Trump in the past and it can be very hard to get him off his talking points. But I think as we're learning in the political arena that Donald Trump doesn't seem to have very many considered thoughts and Chris Matthews exposed that.KURTZ: Chris Matthews is a very good interviewer when he's talking to Republicans -- Hillary Clinton, not so much. And so now the Trump campaign said that when Trump -- when the candidate said that the laws will stay the same, it means until he is president and can start appointing pro-life judges. But the whole media narrative here Kirsten, that Trump, you know, yes he misspoke, but that he is hostile to women. This is a huge mess for the GOP. Is the press taking that a little too far?KIRSTEN POWERS, FOX NEWS ANALYST: I think he's giving them a lot to work with. And it's true that he is very critical and says terrible things about everybody. So -- men and women -- that is absolutely a true statement. But the re-tweeting of that picture of Ted Cruz's wife which he now has, to Maureen Dowd he said he regrets doing, that is different than what he's been doing to the men because that really was something basically sort of saying, look, this woman, she is not as pretty as my wife. And that is something I think a lot of women look at and feel like, okay that's sexist, right? I mean that's somebody who's got an issue with women. So --KURTZ: Reminds them of ex-boyfriends they don't like?POWERS: Well, I just think it's basically makes most women feel like, oh, our most important quality is how we look and you're basically saying -- it just not a nice thing to do and it seems sexist and so we put that in that category. The comments about the abortion stuff as well, I mean, I'm pro- life, but that -- that's way too -- many bridges too far to say something like that. And it's odd that he would say something like that and not realize how explosive it is.KURTZ: I thought the question by Chris Matthews was perfectly fair Susan, but just not fed a criticism on both sides. Pro-life groups and Pro-choice groups hammering Trump on this issue. But he's had this other media narrative that he hasn't quite thought through the issues.SUSAN FERRECHIO, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: That was the most important part of that exchange. Look, the media love to play gotcha with Republican candidates when it comes to social issues like abortion. Chris Matthews just did it in 2012, George Stephanopoulos did it with Mitt Romney in a debate where he talked about over turning a 50 year-old thing that prevented states from banning contraceptives. Those are ridiculous questions and I think Matthews kind of took Trump down the same path, talking about punishment for abortion.Trump probably -- never even crossed his mind. But what it did, as you say, that raises the issue of how -- when he is going to start studying important issues to conservatives, to the Republican parties, for the country? He comes totally unprepared. He speaks off the cuff. He has to make coarse corrections. What does it say about him as a candidate or somebody who wants to actually be president?KURTZ: Let's go back to the column with Maureen Dowd in The New York Times. Now, Trump told me last time I spoke to him that he really likes Maureen Dowd even though she can be very tough on him. She gets him, he says. And so he admitted to her he made a mistake. He used that word mistake in re-tweeting this picture of Senator Cruz's wife, Heidi in unflattering photo compared to Melania. And then defaulted to he attacks men more often than women and is tougher on men than women. What did you make of that column?HOLMES: Well, I think that Donald Trump there has a pattern of attacking women based on their appearance. Just ask Rosie O'Donnell. Now, he's been attacking her for years. But getting to your point about how the media is much more personal and much more aggressive with Republicans on social issues than Democrats, I found you want to talk about getting into the gutter for Miss Dowd to be asking Donald Trump if he knew or dated any women who had an abortion, for someone who is supposedly a pro-choicer, that's about a right to privacy and if that woman she's implicating another woman for him to expose her as possibly someone who sought an abortion.I thought that was completely obnoxious and certainly not the type of question that pro-choicers ever get. Have you known someone who had this procedure and what have been the effects on them?POWERS: Yes, I bet it would be different because if the person is pro- choice, it's different. The point is, have you ever -- you're pro-life and if you've ever been complicit in an abortion, then that does kind of raise some questions about your belief system. I mean if you're really pro-life. I think that whereas a person is pro-choice, they would say, yes, someone's had an abortion.KURTZ: It's consistent.HOLMES: No, but it's a question of does this -- has this policy affected and influenced someone that you know? I thought it was inappropriate and that woman deserves privacy.KURTZ: In his interview with Fox News Sunday Chris Wallace, the first question from Chris was, are new in a process of blowing your campaign? So, look, it's been a very bad week for Donald Trump mostly because of his own missteps. But, is there a sense of payback in the media which have tried again and again and again to ""expose"" Donald Trump to check his missteps, his misstatements, factual matters, to no avail, but now maybe there is a sense that he's on the defensive.POWERS: I think they would do what they're doing to him to any Republican candidate. I just can't imagine ...KURTZ: But not to any Democratic candidate?POWERS: Maybe they would. It would have to be somebody they didn't like, I guess. But the point is, if somebody did, you know -- look, you can get into what happened in the Michelle Fields situation. But the bottom line is Corey Lewandowski should have apologized. Whether her story was accurate or not, what he did was inappropriate and he should have just said, ""You know what, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you."" You know, it won't happen again. Ask for forgiveness and I think that's the kind of thing the media will be covering and probably we will be covering frankly if it was a Democrat.KURTZ: It seems to me the video show that what happened was certainly more than Corey Lewandowski said. He obviously did touch her and grab her and in my view, less than what Michelle Fields said about, you know, almost being thrown to the ground, it didn't seem to be the case. But more importantly Corey Lewandowski is what Donald Trump said about Michelle Fields and whether that fueled again the media's narrative that he can be difficult or hostile towards women.FERRECHIO: Yes, I mean I'm a reporter who is -- has been in so many of these scrums. I spend most of my career stuck a big crowd, trying to get my microphone in there so I can hear so, never, never has anyone ever laid a hand on me. I can't -- that's the -- you draw the line there. He should not have touched her. It doesn't matter if she fell or did not fall or had bruises or did.The fact he grabbed her arm, that's where i stand on that part of it. The fact that he grabbed her arm so, that's where I stand on that part of it, but I think this is an issue not about gender. It's an issue about the press. You don't touch the press. You don't handle the press. And to turn this into an attack against women, does anyone think it was a male reporter who did that that Corey Lewandowski wouldn't have done the exact same thing?It's just how they're bullying everybody. They're bullying the press. And I think that's the big issue here. And the media has a right to be angry about that and to really question the Trump campaign and they should be questioning him more about it.HOLMES: And in defense of the press's coverage of this, Donald Trump is giving this more legs. He was the one who sat there on CNN in the town hall going on for 20 minutes trying to litigate this case into defend of Corey Lewandowski and I just have to point out, in the same week that he says that women should be punished, he says that Corey Lewandowski should be defended for putting his hands on women? I mean, I think that Donald Trump has dug his own grave.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's putting his hands on anybody.KURTZ: On that point, look, the story was fading until the legal charge was brought and the Democrat -- the prosecutor down in Florida is a Democrat. But leaving that aside, there were 16 conservative female commentators who signed a petition urging Donald Trump to fire Corey Lewandowski over this incident. They included Fox News contributors Katy Pavlich, Megan McCain, Dana Loesch, CNN contributors S.E. Cupp and Mary Katherine Ham not with CNN. Greta Van Susteren took issue with that. Let's take a brief look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS: Lewandowski hasn't even had a trial and they're calling for his head. Yes, they've tried and convicted him. And second, each of these women has now shot herself in the foot. It may be a hard sell for each of these women now covering this election to say she's fair.(END VIDEO CLIP)POWERS: I don't know about that.KURTZ: They're all commentators.POWERS: Yeah.KURTZ: So, they're entitled to their opinion.POWERS: Yeah, and I don't think this is an issue. It's not like an ideological issue. This is an issue which I think we're on agreement on, which is he shouldn't have grabbed her. You know, and the fact that -- and then to not apologize for it but then to engage in character assassination. Now it's fair for them to say that what she said was not quite accurate. But nonetheless, something bad did happen. And they should have just apologized for it.KURTZ: Well, you're a commentator. When you sign a petition and you say somebody should be fired, is that stepping out of the role of analysts who may or may not like Trump? Is it becoming a little bit more (INAUDIBLE)HOLMES: Well, there is a line there, right, with commentators, which is are you saying what is happening or what ought to be happening? Are you being an analyst of events or an advocate for a position, and I think that gets blurred constantly when it comes to commentary.POWERS: I know I wouldn't sign -- I wouldn't have signed on to a letter like that even if I agree with what they're saying.FERRECHIO: It would have been better if they had a press group, press organizations send something out about, you don't stick your hands on the press like. You don't -- just the other day in front if the Turkish Embassy, the Secret Service telling the Turkish, you know, protection, saying this is America. You don't grab the press. You don't kick the press. It's important.KURTZ: The reason all this really matters is that we're two days before the Wisconsin primary. Ted Cruz has a 10 point lead according to several polls. If Donald Trump loses Wisconsin, all these criticisms and media about his candidacy are going to be on steroids. And then it's another two weeks until the New York primary. All right, let me get a break. When we come back, we'll get the Trump point of view with campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pearson. And later, exploring this increasingly tabloid campaign with a panel of Outnumbered.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: All these negative stories swirl around Donald Trump, joining us live from Dallas to respond is his campaign spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson. And Katrina, do you believe the media are now pushing a narrative, pushing a theme that Donald Trump is hostile to women?KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP CAMPAIGN SPOKESWOMAN: You know what, Howie, absolutely. But I think we've always known particularly as Republicans, going up against the assumed nominee on the Democrat side, Hillary Clinton, this is exactly the narrative they were going to try to push regardless. I mean, I think they're starting early because they know that Mr. Trump is on a trajectory to win the nomination despite what everyone is saying in D.C. and in the beltway about receiving the delegates.Mr. Trump's support is committed at about 80 percent now, and if he can just maintains his current support moving forward, he will lock up the nomination before the convention.KURTZ: Okay, but do you see this as sort of bias against republicans or do you see a particular effort by the press to sort of slow Trump down or take him down after eight months of pretty contentious relationships -- pretty contentious relations between Donald Trump and the media?PEARSON: Well, there is definitely a huge media bias here and it's actually the Republican Establishment and the #NeverTrump folks who are actually helping the media in this process not understanding that the same thing is going to happen no matter who the Republican nominee is. But just to give you an example, we have seen questions asked to Republican candidates that are never asked to Democratic candidates.For example in the Chris Matthews interview. When was the last time someone sat Hillary Clinton down and asked her about hypothetical positions on particular states of abortion? You just don't see that. But on top of that, you do see --- go ahead.KURTZ: Speaking of that interview, since you brought it up, Trump now says, you now say that he misspoke when he answered the hypothetical question if abortion were illegal, would -- should women be punished and then, of course, the campaign clarified that. Do you think the press is refusing to accept the clarification and keeps just sort of repeating what he said?PEARSON: There's absolutely no question. But I think it's a little bit worse than that, Howie, because they're not even discussing the context of this question because it was hypothetical. Abortion is legal in this country and that's not the context that it was being discussed in.And I've seen on other networks, CNN and MSNBC specifically, when they're talking about this or even in the headlines. They're saying that Mr. Trump said in the interview that he just wanted women to be punished for just an abortion, period. So the entire context is being left out. They're reporting that Mr. Trump wants for a ban on abortion.KURTZ: At the same time, Donald Trump has said a couple times now, that this was a convoluted exchange with Matthews, fair enough, but that MSNBC cut out part of it and MSBC is absolutely not true that this aired -- the exchange on this aired just as it happened.PEARSON:  Well, yes. The portion that we're talking about being cut, and you can go check the tapes whether it's MSNBC or CNN for that matter, is the actual reporting of that interview. Not the interview itself because they are cutting out the context of the proposed hypothetical ban on abortion and that's the part that they're running. They're not running the entire context. They've cut it out to make it look like Donald Trump just simply wanted to punish women for an abortion and that's just not the case.KURTZ: I see. So we'd see the later reporting on it...PEARSON: The reporting.KURTZ: Just briefly on the dustup between Corey Lewandowski and Michelle Fields, regardless who is right and wrong, would it have been better if Trump in particular were more gracious toward a reporter who felt aggrieved over this incident?PEARSON: You know, I'm not really sure. We can say that in hindsight, but I also know that this is another anti-Trump group that pushed this narrative on Twitter. You know, we have to remind people that this is not something that happened and was immediately reported. This took days after a discussion and after a narrative was created on Twitter for this woman to go and file charges against the campaign manager. So this is just another orchestrated attack to try to continue to push that narrative.KURTZ: Kat, I've got a half minute. What about the notion that at a time when Donald Trump had this big lead and should be trying to unify the party that he keeps punching or counter punching as he would say using Twitter and still sort of trafficking in the kind of insults that one might say got him to where he is, but maybe is not the right tone for somebody who is the Republican front-runner?PEARSON: Well, Mr. Trump is Mr. Trump. He's not politically correct and it is one of the biggest drivers of the campaign. He does call it like he sees it. And, you know, I think moving forward, he's going to continue to make those decisions. And at the same time, you know, he's been attacked from 16 sides of Sunday from the media, from the opposition, you name it, Howie. He is fighting back against everyone. So, to sit back and assume that we, the campaign, is supposed to take incoming from all sides and not respond, that's just not going to happen.KURTZ: Certainly wasn't suggesting that. Good to see you this Sunday, Katrina Pierson ...PEARSON: Good to be here.KURTZ: Thanks very much for joining us.PEARSON: Thank you.KURTZ: Ahead, Frank Luntz on ""Saturday Night Live"" joining the media assault on Donald Trump. But up next, Ted Cruz accuses the media of a Trump love fest by giving him way too much air time and some anchors respond.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: It's a charge we've heard for many of Donald Trump's detractors and increasingly from Ted Cruz. The media just roll over for Trump and give him all this free air time. The Texas senator raised that issue with CNN's Anderson Cooper and, well, got a little pushback.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Look, what I knew is that media was engaged in a love fest, giving Donald Trump two billion dollars of free-- COOPER: Sounds like you were engaged in a love fest.CRUZ: No, let's be clear. How many hours of free media does CNN and Fox and every other station -- you let him call in and for a year he got $2 billion of free --COOPER: Well, I got to say, we've asked you for interviews pretty much every day and you've declined every offer on my program.CRUZ: Well Anderson ...JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC: I mean seriously, this is what we heard. We have the same people that -- I'm going to say it, bitch and whine about never being -- you know Donald Trump is on too much. We invite them every day. It's a standing offer every day. And nobody calls in but Donald Trump.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: That's the thing that critics miss. I have asked Senator Cruz's people for interview virtually every week and said I will get on a plane to do it face-to-face. Now, the senator has been kind enough to appear twice on ""MediaBuzz"" and felt he was treated fairly. And his people told me yesterday he may do it again. We've also tried John Kasich. We had the same problem with Marco Rubio who appeared once on this program.Trump says, yes. Again and again and the candidates who do that, yes, get more air time than the candidates who just say no. But is there a price to be paid for interviewing Trump? After Wisconsin radio host Charlie Sykes did a contentious interview with the Donald, MSNBC reported Tony (ph) the couple raised questions about his own network.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TONY DOKOUPIL, MSNBC: Charlie Sykes, he took his opportunity. He knew it was going to be one and done. He does not have to go back to Donald Trump ever again. People were on the beat, people who work for our network, they have to keep that relationship going for a long, long time. Charlie did not have that burden.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: In some cases, that's true. Now, when I interviewed Trump, we've gone out at it hard, butting heads over all kinds of questions, but that's not to say he doesn't get some softball interviews. Ahead on ""MediaBuzz,"" Hillary Clinton hasn't held a real news conference in 120 days, just as the e-mail investigation is once again heating up. But first, what happened after Outnumbered went off the air and we got to talk about the media?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: How much responsibility do the media bear for a campaign that's increasingly being waged in the gutter? I was in New York this week to do ""Outnumbered"" and after the show I raised that issue with Andrea Tantaros, Kennedy, Meghan McCain and Sandra Smith.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: So as the presidential campaign has kind of gone into the gutter, many would say, and with talk of the wives and photos and nude pictures and mistresses and all that, do you think the media have enabled this or enjoying it or just sort of have no choice but to cover it?SANDRA SMITH, FOX NEWS: Well, first, I think you have to say this is what the people want because people are watching this in large droves. They're showing up at these rallies for the candidates. You're seeing more interest in this election.KURTZ: I'm talking about (ph) the tawdry stuff? Do the people want that, too? They probably do.SMITH: It obviously hasn't turned them off because voter turnout has been extremely successful. I got to tell you, I talk to friends and family and show up at restaurants, everybody is talking politics right now. I mean there is just a huge fiery conversation in general right now.LISA KENNEDY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Yeah.KURTZ: Go.KENNEDY: And there's -- sorry. I think there is something really compelling when you have people who are seeking that much power and who can really affect your daily life when there are tabloid accusations made about them because usually, you know, we talk about tabloids we're talking about distraction.We're distracting ourselves from our own lives and the serious issue and it's, you know, popcorn. And now you have -- when those two things come together and the people in power are creating the tabloids or at least feeding them, it's the kind of storm that you can't turn away from.KURTZ: When you have the front-runner sniping at each other, I would argue the media can't just get on their high horse and say, we're not going to cover this because we're too serious. At the same time, you know, it's good for clicks and ratings but then some people turn around and say, well if you didn't cover it, if you didn't give them oxygen, it would be a more high minded campaign.MEGHAN MCCAIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, there have been sex scandals since, I mean, from the beginning of politics in America unless we forget the John Edwards sex scandal was much more nefarious than anything we're talking about now.KURTZ: And also involved the ""National Enquirer.""MCCAIN: And also involved the ""National Enquirer"" exactly. So, my problem actually is I host a radio show and I always try and make these serious issues acceptable and easy to digest by people that are just trying to like drive home and get a little bit of information because so many people, we're a very small minority that does what we do. And I think sometimes journalists get on their intellectual high horse and they're like, why aren't they reading my 8,000 word print, whatever, on the history of whatever. It's like people don't have this kind of time.A lot of people are working two jobs just trying to get by. And they just want information in the kind that they can get. So, I don't have a problem with the media molding with the times.KURTZ: So is it popcorn as Kennedy says or is it revealing of character and also how candidates deal with the swirl of scandalous charges and countercharges?ANDREA TANTAROS, FOX NEWS: I think it points to a culture that is pretty coarsened and pretty eroded and this political season is reflective of that, Howie. I mean this campaign season is pretty despicable, I mean, I have to say. I mean candidates talking about penis size and hands at debates. So when I look at conservatives in this race, I say you have to give us something worth conserving and fighting for and they're not really doing that.KURTZ: There is a serious debate going on about conservatism and about the future of the country. I mean, you see it in the Sanders candidacy and you see it in the Trump candidacy. You know, people who are taking on the political establishment, but it seems like every time that gets any traction, we get distracted by the shiny objects. The things that's ever easy to talk about which are the insults and the sexual innuendo and here's a picture of my wife and here's a picture of your wife.SMITH: I think that's why we're constantly talking on this couch about what this election is going to do for the future of the Republican Party. It does seem that things are changing and the definition of conservatism has changed dramatically over time.MCCAIN: But the one thing I want to say is good journalists rise to the top. There's an interview today and I apologize, I forgot his name -- In Wisconsin, a radio show host that really pressed Donald Trump, really got him squirming. And I think if the right journalist is put in the right situation, you'll get the answers.I think sometimes it's just journalists want to have, you know, sound bites and entertainment. But I actually think if you put the right person in front of these candidates, you'll get decent answers or at least reflections of who the candidates actually are.KURTZ: Yes, two reporters of New York Times spent 100 minutes on the phone with Donald Trump talking about the nuances of foreign policy and I think that was a good exercise in journalism.MCCAIN: His name is Charlie Sykes. Sorry, I just want to say that, Charlie Sykes.KURTZ: Okay, I think that's a good exercise. But then you get into this question when television has to compress it, how much traction does a more complicated story like that get versus oh, he pointed the finger and said he leaked this thing about me and my family. It's a tough choice. We all grapple with this when we make up our lineups, right.TARTARO: Well, and if you look at Twitter all weekend long, you would think is the biggest story in the country right now. It's not. I mean, and I think that's where people are getting frustrated, is there such pressing issues, but in this ADD news cycle, people, one, don't have the time for it and two, they're not really interested in radical Islamic jihadism or the real issues at hand.The media, too, Howie. I mean, the media seems pretty lazy in digging into a lot of these more substantive issues in Washington, D.C. It's much easier to just file another story on Donald Trump or file a story on Ted Cruz and let everybody else discuss it.KURTZ: Well, every once in a while reality intrudes on the reality show campaign and we saw this with the Brussels bombing most recently and of course the attacks in Pakistan on Sunday. And then the media tend to get more serious. But, you know, we have very short attention span and it's very easy to be distracted by the latest bid of, as you say, popcorn.KENNEDY: Yeah. But that's, I mean, what tabloids are. And normally we see celebrities on the cover of Life and Style and In Touch and it's like, oh, Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani. Oh, my goodness.SMITH: But hasn't that been a huge change there in this election? Maybe you could comment further on because you watched this more than anybody. But the cover of ""Us Weekly,"" the other day, it was two political stories. Ted Cruz's story, of course, that's happening right now and Donald Trump. I mean that, to me -- I'm not used to seeing that and it was their top stories and it was their top trending stories.KURTZ: Donald Trump, whatever you -- would you agree or disagree with him and his policies, I mean he uses Twitter as a weapon. He's on hundreds and hundreds of shows. People say, we're giving him free airtime, yes. He seizes it because he makes himself available and also he's interested.KENNEDY: And it's free. You know, he's being outspent as it has been pointed out 10-1, but still, he's got more traction than anyone because he's using that sort of coverage so effectively because it is free and he's figure out how to use that to best --SMITH: Somebody amplify his personality.KURTZ: Donald Trump, peoples say free media, yes. Covering the rallies endlessly when the other candidates don't get that, that's unfair, that tells the playing field. But when he subjects himself to questioning from the Sunday talk show hosts or anchors or me or anyone else, that's earned media because you're taking the journalistic questions not everybody has stepped on.  TANTAROS: Why hasn't anything stuck to Donald Trump? What is your take on that? Why the media has thrown everything they can and nothing sticks?KURTZ: Critics say it's because we in the media haven't reported this or that, we haven't looked into his business background, we don't follow on (INAUDIBLE). We've done all of that and the fact is, that people who like Donald Trump and his message feel like he is running not just against the political establishment but against the media establishment. They don't tend to trust us. They do tend to trust him and so far, at least -- I mean, we always say, okay, this is the one that is going to bring him down. So far he has been Teflon.(END OF VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: It's fun being on that couch. Coming up, new stories say the FBI may be close to wrapping up its e-mail probe just as Hillary Clinton is trying to fend off Bernie Sanders in Tuesday's Wisconsin primary. And later, some truly embarrassing journalism about George Clooney.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: The Washington Post reported this week on the investigation of Hillary Clinton's e-mail saying that 147 FBI agents are involved in the case. The paper later retracted that account quoting sources as saying the actual number is fewer than 50. Still an eye popping figure for a controversy of the former Secretary of State has long insisted has been hyped by the media and her Republican critics. We're back now with the panel and Kirsten Powers, 50 FBI agents seem like a lot, is there too much media speculation about how this e-mail probe could end? Will there be an indictment as opposed to, I don't know, waiting for the outcome of the probe?POWERS: Yeah, it would be nice to wait but at the same time, I think it is newsworthy that this investigation is going on and it sort of looms over the presidential race for people who believe that she could get indicted. That would obviously really change the dynamics of the race. So, it seems like a news story and there should be a way to talk about it, but that doesn't reach any conclusions. We don't really know what the conclusion is going to be.KURTZ: Right, because it is a criminal investigation. Now, many pundits say (INAUDIBLE) the whole process is rigged, the Obama administration is never going to bring an indictment against the Democratic presidential front- runner as if the FBI is incapable of doing its job. Isn't that pure speculation at this point?HOLMES: Of course its speculation and I think it's also trying to lower expectations for conservatives, you know, not to get too far out in front. But has there not been enough of her? I think there hasn't been enough reporting on Hillary Clinton, the e-mail scandal. You called it criminal investigation. She calls it a security review.And even Bernie Sanders her, you know, primary rival, after defending her now says, you what, this is really worth looking into. You have General Michael Flynn, the former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency under Obama saying that anybody who is under this cloud of suspicion has no right to be running for president of the United States.KURTZ: You know there used to be an independent counsel law for situations like this, but both Democrats and Republicans let it expire because both sides have felt they might bypass special prosecutors. I have a sound bite to play for you Susan Ferrechio. This is Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail. She was confronted by a Greenpeace activist on the subject of the contributions that she is taking and let's look at how she responded:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I do not -- I have money from people work for fossil fuel companies.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE).CLINTON: I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about this.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: What do you make of that exchange?FERRECHIO: I thought that was a good moment for her actually.KURTZ: I do, too.FERRECHIO: It showed some excitement, it showed some passion. And I think part of her problem for this whole campaign is Bernie Sanders has been the one with the passion and the excitement.KURTZ: But everything -- almost everything she does is so carefully calibrated. And she got mad. Whether she should have gotten mad, so what? We saw the real Hillary, and on the substance of it, she has -- her campaign has taken contributions from people who happen to work for the oil and gas industry, not from the companies or corporations giving to a PAC. So The Washington Post gave the charge by Sanders three Pinocchio's.FERRECHIO: And yes, it's Bernie's grassroots organization versus Mrs. Clinton's corporate organization and that's been very successful lying for him and that's why it's so sensitive for her.KURTZ: Its' funny how, roughly in politics at least, you get taking money from an illegal oil company is considered now some horrible thing, but, another sound bite for you and this is Senator Sanders talking to MSNBC's Rachel Maddow about Donald Trump and this was fallout of Donald Trump's remarks, which you talked about earlier in the show about abortion. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: But because media is what media is today and any stupid, absurd remark made by Donald Trump becomes the story of the week.MADDOW: Are you suggesting though that the media shouldn't be focusing on his call to potentially jail women who have abortions?(END OF VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: So, this is a standard Sanders refrain. He went on to say, ""no, it should be talked about. We should talk about all of Donald Trump's position that's the media are not serious about this stuff."" But how can you not cover that story?POWERS: Yeah, of course you have to cover it. It's a substantive issue also. It's not like they're covering something that's silly. In this case we actually could say the media is doing their job. And this was a substantive thing that he said. He did retract it. But I think many people found it alarming and that you can be -- say something that hasn't been totally thought through and I think it deserves plenty of coverage.HOLMES: And I think for Senator Sanders, this is sort of (INAUDIBLE) that Donald Trump is sucking up so much of the media attention. I think that was really what he is trying to say, which is I want more attention for me.KURTZ: Half a minute. Tuesday's Wisconsin Primary, Bernie Sanders has won five out of the last six states if I'm not mistaken. If he wins Wisconsin, will it convince the press that he actually could win the nomination or is that just argumentative (ph).FERRECGIO: No, because there's momentum and then there's math. He does not have the math to get to the right number of delegates because she's got most of the super delegates who are the establishment. And because of that, she's got such a lock on those that he would have to win almost two-thirds of everything going forward. I don't think anyone thinks that's going to happen.KURTZ: Media love momentum, they hate math. We all had trouble with math in high school. Susan Ferrechio, Kirsten Powers, Amy Holmes, thanks very much for stopping by this Sunday. After the break, ""Saturday Night Live"" now beating up on Donald Trump. Frank Luntz weighs in on the cultural attacks on the Donald. And later, why is Hollywood freaking out over what Susan Sarandon said about Donald Trump?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Another bad week for Donald Trump with women. Joining me to talk about it from the Tea Party News Network is Donald Trump defender Scotty Nell Hughes.SCOTTIE NELL HUGHES, TRUMP DEFENDER: High, Kate. As a woman, I like Donald Trump but as a full-blown nut job, I freaking love him.(LAUGHTER)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When I say women, you say suck. Women.UNIDENTIFIED MALE/FEMALE: Suck.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Women.UNIDENTIFIED MALE/FEMALE: Suck.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Saturday night live mocking CNN's Kate Bolduan. Scottie Nell (INAUDIBLE) of course the Donald. Joining us now is Frank Luntz, Republican pollster and Fox News contributor. So, when Trump's supposed alleged hostility to women moves from the op ed pages to SNL, is that a cultural barometer? They're hard to change?FRANK LUNTZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It's significant. Look, if people are indifferent to you, you can go in either direction. Even if people are starting to get a feeling that there is something wrong, you can still turn it. Once they have decided that they don't like you or more importantly that they don't trust you, they never come back. No matter what the print journalist say or what TV says. And in this case, with SNL it's now ridicule. And there are several segments ...KURTZ: It's not laughing with Trump as in some earlier skits.LUNTZ: It's laughing at him and it's making a judgment and this has been the best year for SNL in a long time. But they are skewering Trump, and everyone is now laughing at him, not with him.KURTZ: Darrell Hammond does a great job. All right, so we talked about in the show about Maureen Dowd's comment in the New York Times interview with Donald Trump in which he uttered these words to her, ""yeah, it was a mistake,"" where this is referring to his re-tweeting an unflattering picture of Heidi Cruz, the senator's wife next to a picture of his wife, Melania. Is there a media message here not just from Maureen that he needs to change his tone and perhaps when he's wrong and made more mistakes, is a word he does not like to use.LUNTZ: I don't think he hears it. In watching him, as someone who has done this now for 25 years, I don't see -- I don't see that he feels it. It's what makes him so tough that he can withstand any criticism, from the networks and the print journalists. But I don't think that he feels it as a person. He needs to go -- and there's only one show to do this on frankly, it's ""60 Minutes"" and he needs to go and emote.KURTZ: I thought you were going to ""MediaBuzz."" Emote, like sitting on Oprah's couch.LUNTZ: Yes.KURTZ: We see Donald Trump's emotions all the time.LUNTZ: That's a different kind of emotion. That's him as aggression. That's him as in your face. He needs to sit back and be self-reflective and it's not something he is.KURTZ: I think what journalists miss is, look, this tough guy, street fighter persona is what got him to this usually GOP race. Ana also, this is how he was in the tabloid tough town of New York for years and years and years and became an international celebrity so, I think it's hard for him to let that go.LUNTZ: Well, what gets you to the Republican nomination does not get you through the general election. And I'm watching newspapers already say that the election is over. There hasn't been a convention.KURTZ: Before you give me this answer -- you set me up nicely -- because there is New York Times front page lead story about Trump could face a humiliating loss in the fall if he wins the nomination. He could be hard pressed to get 200 out of the (INAUDIBLE) electoral votes. I remember when Michael Dukakis was 17 points up in the spring of '88 against George W. Bush. Aren't these prognostications on a campaign where Trump, if he's the nominate and Hillary haven't even squared off, aren't that premature?LUNTZ: Walter Mondale was tied with Ronald Reagan in 1984 and he lost in a land slide. Five days before the election Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter were tied and they had a debate and that changed everything. We have to see what happens in the conventions and most importantly, the first presidential debate. Mitt Romney won that debate and if he had done the same way in the second and third debates, he could have been elected president. The debates matter.KURTZ: We have less than half a minute. When you look at stories like this, I mean you know, look, it's a good data analysis and you want to talk about unfavorable and so forth, but do you think we are too much in the prediction business?LUNTZ: They have every right to tell us how things would be if things don't change. But I want viewers to understand that things do change. This is the most fluid election ever and people are changing their minds all the time.KURTZ: And that's why we have campaigns and if the polls were predictive, Jeb Bush would be the Republican nominee and he's out of the race. Frank Luntz, great to see you here in Washington. Still to come, Susan Sarandon in a celebrity spat for failing to condemn Donald Trump. And George Clooney says journalism has just reached a new low.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: I never quite get why the media are endlessly enamored of movie stars and their political views, but Susan Sarandon, an actress who I like, who's been campaigning with Bernie Sanders, touched off a furor after saying on MSNBC that a lot of Bernie supporters won't be able to bring themselves to vote for Hillary Clinton.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What about you personally?SUSAN SARANDON, MOVIE ACTRESS: I don't know. I'm going to see what happens.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Really?SARANDON: Really.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I cannot believe it as we're watching the ...SARANDON: Well, you know some people feels Donald Trump will bring the revolution immediately.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: What? She might back Trump over Hillary? This brought a blast from fellow actress Debra Messing, ""Susan Sarandon muses that Trump presidency will be better for the country than Hillary. Wonder if she'd say that if she were poor, gay, Muslim or immigrant, wow. Sarandon said Messing should just watch the interview not just read the headlines. I guess in some Hollywood circles, failing to denounce Trump is simply unacceptable.George Clooney says he's used to being misquoted, but that Hello Magazine has done something new and ""very disturbing."" The magazine publishing the interview with the actor headlined, ""George Clooney reveals wife, Amal Clooney's most attractive feature which was picked up by plenty of other media outlets. The problem, Clooney never spoke to Hello and says the interview is fabricated and full of inaccurate post. But the magazine says it dismayed by Clooney's comments that had bought the interview from a respectable independent agent and the article is cobbled together from old interviews. Uhm, hello? You published a false piece of garbage and you are defending it? You should apologize to Clooney or kiss your credibility good-bye.And that's it for this edition of ""MediaBuzz."" I'm Howard Kurtz.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Chris Wallace.Facing more fire than ever before, Donald Trump sits down with ""Fox News Sunday.""(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  Are you in the process of blowing your campaign for president?  We discuss the fallout from his statements on abortion.  You offended both the pro-life and pro-choice movement with one statement.  His comments on Heidi Cruz and his defiant support for his campaign manager.  And those controversial remarks about letting more countries develop nukes.  The growing knock on you is that you haven't thought these things through.  You haven't studied.  That you wing it too often.  Donald Trump face-to-face on ""Fox News Sunday.""Then, convention chaos.  The other GOP candidates back out of their loyalty pledges.  SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Nominating Donald Trump is a train wreck.  That's actually not fair to train wrecks.  GOV. JOHN KASICH, R-OHIO, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Let's see what happens at the convention.WALLACE:  RNC Chairman Reince Priebus joins us live on the possibility of a contested convention.Plus, we'll ask our Sunday panel whether the ""stop Trump movement"" is gaining momentum, as Ted Cruz surges in Wisconsin.And our power player of the week: one family's decade's long service at the White House.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Only in America can something like this happen.  WALLACE:  All right now on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  And hello again from Fox News in Washington.  Donald Trump has seemed bullet-proof in this campaign, surviving and even thriving on one controversy after another.  But this week, it started to catch up with him and Trump now trails in polling for Tuesday's primary in Wisconsin.  On Friday, we sat down with Trump for a candid and sometimes contentious interview at Trump Tower in New York.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  Mr. Trump, welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday.""DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Thank you.WALLACE:  This may sound harsh, but are you in the process of blowing your campaign for president?TRUMP:  I don't think so.  I just got great polls from NBC nationwide. I think that we're doing very well.  Don't forget, you have been thinking about that or given me that question numerous times over the last, since June 16th.  I've had that statement made many times; he just blew his campaign, only to end up having higher poll numbers.  WALLACE:  But you like to talk about polls, let's talk about some.  In a Wisconsin poll a month ago, you were leading Cruz by 10 points.  In the same poll, the Marquette poll, out this week, you're now trailing Cruz by 10 points.  In the latest Fox poll, 67 percent of women nationally now have an unfavorable view of you.  If you had purposely set out to turn off voters, especially women voters over the last two weeks, I'm not sure you could have done a better job.  TRUMP:  Well, you know, all I can do is do what I do.  I'm self-funding my campaign.  I'm not one of these politicians that's being controlled by the people that give them money.  Believe me, they are totally controlled.  I think I'm doing very well.  Was this my best week?  I guess not.  I could have done without the retweet, et cetera, et cetera, but I think I'm doing OK.WALLACE:  I want to talk to you about -- I want to talk to you about that. First of all, Wisconsin.  How important is Wisconsin?  How big a setback if you don't win there?TRUMP:  Well, I'd like to win it.  Is it a big setback?  I would like to win it.WALLACE:  Do you think it would jeopardize your ability to get to 1,237?TRUMP:  It would always be better to win.  I think I get there anyway, but I like Wisconsin, I like the people of Wisconsin, I think they like me, I've had tremendous crowds.  We've had a tremendous response, and I think I'm going to do very well in Wisconsin.WALLACE:  You say you've had better weeks.  Let's talk about your comments this week, about what you would like to see if abortions became illegal.  Here you are.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC ANCHOR:  Do you believe in punishment for abortion, yes or no, as a principle?TRUMP:  The answer is that there has to be some sort of punishment.MATTHEWS:  For the woman?TRUMP:  Yes.  There has to be some form.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  It took you two written statements to clean that up.TRUMP:  Well, it took me really two statements because they were sort of different statements and they were on different subjects.WALLACE:  But then the president of National Right to Life tweeted this, ""The inept thing Donald Trump said about women who have abortions is making pro-lifers cringe.""You did something pretty remarkable.  You offended both the pro-life and the pro-choice movements with one statement.TRUMP:  Well, look, it was asked as a hypothetical, and talked about if it's illegal, and it was hypothetically asked.  WALLACE:  But you gave that answer.TRUMP:  There would have been -- there would have been a very strong conservative, a very conservative group that would have said that was the appropriate answer.  I'm not saying it was the appropriate answer.  I'd say it's the doctor's fault or whoever performs the act, it's their fault.  But there was a time when that would have been, and maybe today that would have been, but that was asked as a hypothetical question.WALLACE:  But why did you say the woman?TRUMP:  Because it was asked hypothetically.  I said the woman because it was asked hypothetically.  I also corrected it and I made it very much so that I think everybody, it's acceptable now for everybody.  But --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  Do you agree it was a mistake?TRUMP:  Well, I -- as a hypothetical question, I would have rather asked it -- you know, answered it in a different manner, yes.  I would have rather answered it in a different manner.  WALLACE:  The growing knock on you, and you read everything, so you know this is what people are saying, is that you haven't thought these things through.  You haven't studied, that you wing it too often.  Do you think that's fair?TRUMP:  Well, let me just tell you.  I've been a really successful businessman for a long time.  I was never asked many questions.Like I was asked a question about NATO the other day by Wolf Blitzer.  I think I gave a great answer.  I said, it's obsolete, we spend too much money, we're not getting the benefits that we should be getting for the money.  We're carrying a lot of countries, you have 28 countries, 68 years old.  We are not being treated fairly by the world and I mean that.  I've been a politician now for eight months.  WALLACE:  I understand.TRUMP:  I'm going to straighten out the country.  We're going to make America great again.  Politicians can't do that.  I've been a politician for a very short period of time.  I announced --WALLACE:  So, what are you saying, you've still got a learning curve?TRUMP:  There's always a learning curve.  I don't care if you've been doing it all your life, there's a learning curve, especially with something like you're talking about NATO, when you're talking about -- because it is a very movable subject.  I will say this: NATO is obsolete.  NATO doesn't cover terrorism.  NATO was based around the Soviet Union.  WALLACE:  Wait, wait, OK, I was --  (CROSSTALK)TRUMP:  No, no, but it's important to know, because when I talk about --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  OK, fine.  Do you know how many NATO soldiers have died in Afghanistan helping us after the 9/11 attack on the U.S.?  Do you know how many NATO soldiers have died?TRUMP:  I'm not saying -- I'm not saying it's a bad thing.  I'm saying it's unfair --  WALLACE:  A thousand is the answer.TRUMP:  Fine, I'm saying -- and it's a lot of soldiers.  I'm saying it's a -- I'm saying it's unfair to us.  It's unfair to us as a country.WALLACE:  But they've been defending us against terrorism.TRUMP:  Excuse me.  We are paying so much money, disproportionately.  We have countries that are being carried along.  It's not fair to the United States, not fair to the citizens, and not fair to the taxpayers.  And what I said was exactly right.  Now when they cover it, they say, Donald Trump doesn't like NATO.  I think NATO's fine.  I think NATO has to be readjusted.  I think we have to cover terrorism, because we're really not covering terrorism.WALLACE:  Well, in Afghanistan we are.TRUMP:  Sure.  But, we --WALLACE:  Well, that counts, sir.TRUMP:  We have to -- excuse me.  I'm sure it counts.  But I'm saying, we have to be very specific on terrorism.  NATO is no specific to terrorism.  Why are we taking the burden of the cost when big beneficiaries are paying very little?  And the reason is because they're ripping off the United States, just like everybody else that does business with us.  They're ripping off our country, and that's why we owe $19 trillion.WALLACE:  You talk about the fact that you've only been a politician for eight months, but there are other issues that you've gotten in trouble on in the last week or so that have more to do with just judgment and temperament.  For instance, the fact that you spent days going after Ted Cruz's wife and her looks --TRUMP:  Excuse me, excuse me.  Ted Cruz --  WALLACE:  Let me just ask --  TRUMP:  Ted Cruz came after me --WALLACE:  No, he didn't.TRUMP:  Well, he did through my wife.WALLACE:  No, he didn't.TRUMP:  He took a picture --WALLACE:  No, he didn't.TRUMP:  Oh, of course he did, of course he did.  WALLACE:  Do you have any evidence that he knew about the attack by the independent super PAC?TRUMP:  My evidence is total common sense.  He knew those people, those people are 100 percent for them, they coordinated together.  I have no doubt about it in a million years.  He did that attack -- and this was just --WALLACE:  Even if it he did it, was it worth you spending --(CROSSTALK)TRUMP:  No, I would say probably not.  If I had it to do again, I probably wouldn't have sent it.  I didn't think it was particularly bad, but I probably wouldn't have sent it.  But this was a response.  This wasn't me starting something, this was a response.WALLACE:  The Michelle Fields battery case, your campaign manager said he never touched her, you said she made it up.  Then, one of your surveillance videos, I've got to say, you've got your places covered showed --TRUMP:  I am very well covered.  (CROSSTALK)TRUMP:  And I was very happy to give them that tape.WALLACE:  To show the fact that he didn't touch her, and then you said this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  I think it's something that's disgraceful.  I think that you, as a reporter, and all of you as a reporter, probably get treated a lot rougher than that on a daily basis.(END VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  I agree with it.WALLACE:  Question: why not just apologize to her?TRUMP:  Because --  WALLACE:  I mean, he did grab her.TRUMP:  Because let me tell you why: loyal person, number one.  WALLACE:  I'm not saying you fire him.TRUMP:  And when she wrote out, early on, before she knew she was on tape, that it was that she was practically thrown to the ground, I mean, I wish I had it here, I'd read her statement --WALLACE:  I know what she said.TRUMP:  That didn't happen.  OK?  Do you agree with that?WALLACE:  I agree with you.  But why not just apologize --TRUMP:  Excuse me, Chris, no, but she lied.  Do you agree that she lied?WALLACE:  I think she completely misrepresented it early on.  I do.TRUMP:  Early on is all that matters.WALLACE:  But why turn one day into two weeks?TRUMP:  Chris -- well, at least it shows I'm loyal, because the easiest thing for me to do would have been to destroy that man's life.  And I would have fired him immediately.  Had she fallen to the ground, or almost fallen to the ground like she said -- she didn't even change the expression on her face.  She kept walking.WALLACE:  So, you have no regrets about letting this thing go on for two weeks?TRUMP:  Chris, I think, frankly, I don't think she would have accepted that.  I think she would have used that as ammunition against.  A lot of times, when you apologize, they use it as ammunition against.The easier thing would have been, Corey, you're fired.  You're not very good at that, OK?   But I don't want to ruin him.  The man has a wife and four beautiful children.  He lives in New Hampshire, he's a good person.  I don't want to destroy him.  WALLACE:  You weighed in this week on foreign policy national security.  Here is what you said about Japan and South Korea defending themselves against North Korea.  Here it is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR:  So you have no problem Japan and South Korea having nuclear weapons?TRUMP:  At some point, we have to say, you know what, we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea.  We're better off, frankly, if South Korea is going to start to protect itself --(END VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  What do they have to pay us?  We're defending Japan.  We can't afford it.  We're a better nation.WALLACE:  I understand that.  But that's the question -- that's not the question.  The question is, letting them develop their own nuclear program.  For more than half a century, U.S. policy has been that we protect those countries with our nuclear umbrella so they don't --TRUMP:  And lose a fortune.WALLACE:  I understand, but the idea is not to have a nuclear arms race in the Northern Pacific, on the Korean peninsula.  TRUMP:  Are you ready?WALLACE:  You want to throw that all away.TRUMP:  Are you ready?  No, no, I'm not throwing anything away.  This is common sense.  This is like trade.  We lose on every trade deal.  Sometimes you're better off saying, hey, wait a minute.  We're defending Japan, we're -- I mean, what we're doing is costing us a fortune, and not only Japan, South Korea.  We have 28,000 soldiers on the line.  And part of that defense is nukes, right?  At some point, they have to pay us, because we cannot continue --WALLACE:  But they do pay us.TRUMP:  They pay us peanuts.WALLACE:  They pay us almost $1 billion, South Korea.  I think $2 billion in Japan.TRUMP:  That's peanuts compared to what we're talking about and compared to the real threat.WALLACE:  You want to have a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula?TRUMP:  In many ways, and I say this, in many ways, the world is changing.  Right now, you have Pakistan and you have North Korea and you have China and you have Russia and you have India and you have the United States and many other countries have nukes.  WALLACE:  Understood.TRUMP:  It's not like, gee whiz, nobody has them.  So, North Korea has nukes.  Japan has a problem with that.  I mean, they have a big problem with that.  Maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea.  WALLACE:  With nukes?TRUMP:  Maybe they would be better off -- including with nukes, yes, including with nukes.WALLACE:  In South Korea, with nukes?TRUMP:  South Korea is right next door, just so you understand.WALLACE:  But that means you can have a nuclear arms race on the Korean Peninsula.TRUMP:  You already have it, Chris.  You already have a nuclear arms race.  When a guy like Kasich gets up and talks about, Trump wants to give everybody missiles -- I don't want to give missiles.  And by the way, I'd leave it the way it is, ideally.My number one choice is, leave it the way it is, but they have to pay us because we cannot afford to continue to lose the billions and billions of dollars that we're losing in order to defend Japan and Germany and South Korea and Saudi Arabia.  WALLACE:  This week, you said you no longer continue to pledge that you will support the Republican nominee for president.  Then on Thursday, you had a meeting with the RNC that you said was very nice and they treated you well.So, are you pledging to support the nominee or not?TRUMP:  I will be looking at who the nominee is and I think people will be very happy with my decision.  WALLACE:  But here's the point.  In South Carolina, it turns out, you took a pledge to support the nominee.  If you break that pledge, then you lose all those delegates.  So, are you going to keep the pledge or not?TRUMP:  What the real point I made, and that whole transaction or, you know, talking point that you're talking about, was that I release Ted Cruz.  He does not have to endorse me if I win.  I think I'm going to win, but he doesn't have to endorse me.  I don't need his support.  I have the support of the people.  WALLACE:  But you still need their support if you're going to beat the Democrats.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP:  Look, I was very popular in North Carolina.WALLACE:  Don't you want a united party?TRUMP:  I'd like to see a united party, but I also watched the turmoil in his brain when they were talking about Trump and support and, well, I don't, oh, you know, he's going crazy.  All I want to do is relieve the pressure.  This man does not react well under pressure.  I've watched him.  He's a basket case.  So, in order to relieve the pressure, I'm telling you, Ted, don't worry about it, you don't have to endorse me.WALLACE:  Are you ruling out running as an independent third party candidate?  Are you ruling that out?TRUMP:  Look, I'm by far the frontrunner as a Republican.  I want to run as a Republican.  I will beat Hillary Clinton.WALLACE:  But if you don't get the nomination?TRUMP:  We're going to have to see how I was treated.  I'm going to have to see how I was treated.  Very simple.  WALLACE:  So you're not ruling it out?TRUMP:  I just want to be treated -- it's not a question of win or lose.  It's a question of treatment.  I want to be treated fair.WALLACE:  After the last two weeks, after all of these controversies, and plans to change your campaign?  Any plans to lay off the personal attacks?  Any plans, maybe, to study some of these issues more?TRUMP:  Originally when I went out with 17 people, we're down now to three.  I have two leftovers, OK?  I call them leftovers.  They haven't been nice to me.  I will beat them.  After I beat them, I'm going to be so presidential, you're going to be so bored, you're going to say, this is the most boring human being I've ever interviewed.  WALLACE:  Mr. Trump --  TRUMP:  Thank you.WALLACE:  It's always interesting.  I don't think you could be dull even if you wanted to be.TRUMP:  Well, I think I may act very presidential, I'll be dull.  But that will be fine.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  And you can watch more of our interview with Donald Trump at foxnewssunday.com.  When we come back, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus joins us live.  We'll ask him about Trump's refusal to rule out an independent campaign if he doesn't win the nomination.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  A look outside at the beltway at the Milwaukee Public Market, ahead of Tuesday's Wisconsin primary.  Well, as you just saw, Republican front-runner Donald Trump says he doesn't necessarily stand by his pledge to support the GOP nominee and he won't rule out an independent run.Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus watched our interview, along with al of you and he joins us now from RNC headquarters here in Washington.  Chairman Priebus, you just heard Donald Trump.  He is keeping open the possibility that he may not support the Republican nominee if it's not him, keeping open the possibility that he might run as an independent candidate.  Does that worry you?  REINCE PRIEBUS, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  Well, not really.  I mean, I think some of the stuff is leverage and candidates that are posturing for a potentially open convention.  But, look, one of the things that I think people are missing is that this pledge, this pledge to support the eventual nominee comes from really a data agreement that the candidate sign.  So, without boring everyone to tears, spent hundreds of millions of dollars on data and information over the last several years at the RNC.  These candidates have access to that data.  And in exchange for getting stuffed from the national party, we say, well, are you willing to support the nominee?  And they say, yes, we are.  And they sign a document.  My point would be if a candidate isn't willing to commit to the principles and values of our party, then they ought to just tell us.  But if they commit to it, then they should do it.  And these candidates are running to be the nominee of our party.  We're not running for their loyalty.  They're running so that one of them will be chosen by us.  And so, I can't imagine a candidate for any position anywhere in America running in front of a group and saying, well, we don't know if we want to be part of this group but we want to be the chairman or president of that group anyway.  WALLACE:  But, respectfully, sir, I feel like you're missing the point, which is obviously they're running to win.  But what Trump is saying, and actually to a certain degree Cruz and Kasich as well is, if they don't win and if the other guy wins, then they may not support the candidate.  I mean, the result of that would be that the GOP would be split and have a harder time winning in November.  PRIEBUS:  Well, certainly.  And you can't win by subtracting and dividing.  I understand that.  I mean, we're the party of the open door which means you got to let people in.  We've got to grow.  We've got to unify.  And with unity, anything is possible.  So, certainly, there will be work to do in Cleveland, especially if it's an open convention and bringing the party together.  I think we're going to have a lot of time to do that.  But, yes, is it going to be a challenge with rhetoric like this on all sides?  Sure.  But that's what we have to do in putting on a convention that unifies and is open and transparent, and people feel that they had a fair shake and we have to respect the voice and vote of all of the folks out there and the delegates and voters.  WALLACE:  I want to, I want to --PRIEBUS:  So, I get the challenge.  WALLACE:  I want to get to -- back to this question.  You say that when Trump and the other candidates got the voter data from the RNC, they signed an agreement.  Did they, in that agreement, did they pledge in return for getting the data, did they pledge to support the nominee and are you prepared to enforce that agreement?  PRIEBUS:  Well, I mean, listen, I'm not going to get into every detail of the agreement.  But it's a data exchange agreement with the RNC and among the things that they can use at the RNC.  One of the things that we say is, look, we'll give you these things.  But you have to agree that you're going to support the party and the eventual nominee.  They've all agreed to that.  And we'll see what happens.  I would just say this, I really do believe, though, that this is posturing and I know posturing can have an effect.  And that means that challenges could be greater.  So I'm not dispelling your point and these questions.  But I personally think that these folks are posturing and I think that they want to be loyal to the party.  I think they will be loyal to the party.  But really, it's about the people out there and respecting the voices of the folks both in the states and on the floor of the convention.  WALLACE:  I just want to button this down briefly if I can, because you say that there's an agreement.  You gave them something of value which was that this voter data, access to your files.  So, are you prepared, if they break the agreement, to enforce it?  In effect, what I'm saying is are you prepared to sue Donald Trump or one of the other candidates if they don't support the nominee as they pledge to do to get the data?  PRIEBUS:  Well, look, I mean, no one has broken the pledge.  I mean talking about what might be hypothetical is one thing.  It is certainly not any standing -- it doesn't provide standing to do anything.  It's just a bunch of talk at this point.  But certainly, we expect that when candidates make commitments, that they keep them.  And that's about what I'm going to say about it.WALLACE:  OK, after Mitt Romney's defeat in 2012, you commissioned what has been called an autopsy of what went wrong and what the party needed to do differently going forward in 2014 and 2016.  And the report concluded that the GOP had to do a much better job reaching out to Hispanics and African-Americans, women and young people.  But ""The Washington Post"" has a new poll out this month, 85 percent of Hispanics view Trump unfavorably, 80 percent of African-Americans view him unfavorably, 80 percent of young people, 75 percent of women.  Chairman Priebus, The Post concluded that Trump at this point would be the most unpopular candidate for president in modern times in either major party.  PRIEBUS:  Well, look, I mean, obviously we're having a conversation within a small circle of people.  And, you know, tone and tenor have consequences.  And it means that the challenge is in the general election will be -- will be there for us to make the message to every American no matter who they are, that our party is a door that we want them to walk through.  But, look, if you look at what's happening on the Democrat side of the aisle --WALLACE:  Haven't you done a pretty good job?  (CROSSTALK)PRIEBUS:  You look at Hillary Clinton --WALLACE:  If I may, just briefly though --PRIEBUS:  Go ahead.WALLACE:  -- but hasn't Donald Trump, hasn't Ted Cruz closed that door for a lot of the groups that you want to reach out to?  PRIEBUS:  No, I don't think so.  I think there's a lot of time, Chris, in the general election.  We're going to be having ten people every ten blocks in these communities and you saw the difference that we made with what we learned from that growth and opportunity to report in 2014 when we won 46 percent of the Hispanic vote in Colorado.  We spent about $8 million on the ground doing it.  We won 28 percent of the black vote in Ohio.  That didn't just happen because of just coincidence.  It happened because we reached out to tell people of the values of equality and freedom and opportunity that our party provides.  We're going to do the same thing.  We didn't do that in 2012.  We just atrophied in 2012.  And so, certainly, yes, tone matters and when you say things that people don't agree with, it can have an effect, but we can overcome it.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  But do you really think that the Hispanic voters, sir, are going to forget what Donald Trump has said about illegal immigrants, what Ted Cruz has said about illegal immigrants?  I mean, they're not going to forget it.  PRIEBUS:  I don't -- I don't -- listen, but I don't know what the outcome is going to be over the next several months.  And certainly, if you're on the ground making the presentation to Hispanic voters across this country with a real operation, with real people, talking about the values of our party, I think that you can improve over 2012.  We have to improve over 2012.  But it's my job at the RNC to make sure that we're providing an infrastructure in place so that can you go door to door.  You can go to the church festival on Sunday.  You can go to the black chamber meetings and talk about the economy.  I think that's how you move voters across this country.  WALLACE:  One last question I want to get into with you, chairman.  The RNC set up a website this week to explain how an open contested convention would work.  And I want to focus in on one specific issue that could become a big deal in July and that's Rule 40B of the Republican convention.  It says, ""Each candidate for nomination for president of the United States shall demonstrate the support of a majority of the delegates from each of eight or more states.""  They've got to have a majority from eight or more states before they can even place their name in nomination.Now, that's pretty clear in the first ballot.  The question is, what happens on the second ballot?  If -- and a lot of these delegates then become unbound, if a number of them then decide to go for somebody else, can that person become a candidate for nomination?  And I guess the real question is, do you have to be a candidate for nomination?  Can somebody completely outside the 1,237 delegates vote for that person, does that become the nominee?  PRIEBUS:  OK.  First of all, that rule is a rule that was drafted by the Romney delegates of 2012.  And that rule, obviously, will be reviewed by the 2016 rules committee, which will be made up mostly of Trump and Cruz delegates.  And, you know, they will likely have an incentive to probably not change that rule.But let's just play out your hypothetical.  If, in fact, that rule stays in place, you're asking, number one, can someone on a later ballot when most of the delegates are unbound be nominated?  I think they can be.  But that would be an extreme hypothetical, I think, and highly unlikely.  But you asked the question.  I think it's possible.  And at that point, if you get into a multi-ballot convention where you've got five or six or seven rounds, it's possible that a person can be nominated that's not one of the three.  But my position is, and I think I'm -- I think it's absolutely correct, our nominee is likely to be the one of the three people running.  So, I mean, I think it's interesting how far out we can play this out, but it's possible as you lay out.  WALLACE:  Chairman Priebus, to be continued.  Thank you.  Thanks for talking with us today, sir.  PRIEBUS:  You bet.  WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss Trump's troubles and what a loss in Wisconsin would mean for the Republican race.  Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about Trump's statements on abortion?  How damaging are they?  Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: As Donald Trump met with his new foreign policy team, President Obama questioned his credential on national security.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We've been able to avoid catastrophe. And we don't want somebody in the Oval Office who doesn't recognize how important that is.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Our Sunday group discusses Trump's tough week, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: There's no doubt that Donald Trump is the Kim Kardashian presidential candidate. He sits on Twitter and makes a lot of noise, but he has no solution to fixing the problem.KASICH: He's really not prepared to be president of the United States.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Well, Ted Cruz and John Kasich piling on Donald Trump after all his recent problems. And it's time now for our Sunday group. Syndicated columnist George Will, Julie Pace, who covers the White House and the campaign for the Associated Press, Stephen Dinan of The Washington Times and Charles Lane from The Washington Post.Julie, you were covering the Trump campaign this week and -- and I guess the question I have is, are we making too much of his troubles? You look at the delegate count. He's still 273 delegates ahead of Ted Cruz. After Wisconsin, the primaries head to the northeast where he should do well. So, big picture, how much trouble is he in?JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: I think that Trump is still in the strongest position of any of these candidates that are left. He's, according to the AP delicate count, he's the only one that can clinch the nomination through the regular voting process. At the same time, he has to do much better than he's been doing in order for that to happen.There is still room for Ted Cruz in particular to go on a good run in the remaining contacts and get close to him in the delegate count, which would put us in a contested convention fight. And I think the problem for Trump with what's happened over the last week or so is that while he's been Teflon on a lot of these comments that he's made, politicians tend to get in trouble when they do things that reinforce a negative perception of them.And he did that on two fronts this week. One was highlighting what seems to be a lack of depth on policy with his comments on abortion. And, two, is highlighting problems that he has with women. And so I think reinforcing both of those negatives could have problems going forward, but it is important, when you look at the math, to note that he is the only one who can clinch through this regular process.WALLACE:  We asked you for questions for the panel and we got a bunch on this topic. Al Blair tweeted, ""the issue hurting Trump is really not abortion or women, it's his failure to properly prepare on most substantive matters."" And there was this from Barbara Sither on Facebook, ""if Trump spent his time thoroughly researching the pro-life principles as well as any topic instead of tweeting for hours each day, he may not have made these small but cumulative mistakes.""George, how do you answer Al and Barbara?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, there's a policy dimension and a process dimension to running for president. On the policy side, on abortion, he was asked a question that every novice Republican candidate knows he's going to be asked. And he didn't have an answer. Now, that's partly because he's only been pro-life for about 15 minutes. He's at the end of his seventh decade and he's just beginning to think about these things. We -- the world needs more nuclear weapons nations. There are sophisticated game theorists who can tell you why there's an argument to be made for that. No one thinks that Donald Trump arrived at that conclusion via game theory.Now take the process side. He has been surfing on this wave of free publicity, coming in, holding a big rally, flying away again. Other candidates, particularly Cruz, have a very granular on the ground approach to this. I spent some time in Houston with Jeff Roe and the others this week.WALLACE:  The campaign manager for Ted Cruz.WILL: Campaign manager, where they -- they knew that this weekend the center of the political universe was Fargo, North Dakota, where they're selecting 25 uncommitted delegates. But it goes beyond that. They're preparing for the second battle. They say, OK, you're a Trump ballot -- a Trump delegate bound on the first, maybe second ballot. Afterward, we want you to have good feelings about this. They know that they want to put in place all the party regulars, people who are delegates who are county commissioners, sheriffs, all these people who will respond to someone who wants to be a party headed by someone who's been in the party for a while.And then, finally, they're stacking the rules committee because rule 40-B is going to come up and when the -- the vote comes to perhaps repeal that, they're going to run into a wall of people sympathetic to Ted Cruz because they're working politics (INAUDIBLE).WALLACE:  And -- and -- and that, of course, is the point, and that's what I was talking about with Reince Priebus because, yes, they may be legally bound to vote for Trump for the first ballot, some maybe for two or three, but most of them just for the first ballot. And after that, they can vote for whomever they want. And if they're basically a Cruz partisan, once they're released legally in the second or third ballot, they're going to go for the person they like, not Donald Trump, whom they were supposedly selected, at least in the first ballot, to support.It's not, of course, just Trump. A pro-Kasich super PAC has started running this ad portraying Ted Cruz as Pinocchio being strangled by his growing nose wrapping around his neck. And while Kasich disavowed that, he went after Cruz himself.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KASICH: The problem with Senator Cruz is he has no record. His record is shutting down the government and making everybody he works with upset.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Stephen, you know, and this goes back to what I was discussing with Reince Priebus, is the Republican Party, is the GOP headed for a train wreck in Cleveland?STEPHEN DINAN, THE WASHINGTON TIMES: Well, they could be. You know, these -- these conventions, you really, as you said, there are a lot of options, a lot of hypotheticals and really everything does get on the table because they write the rules for themselves.Having said that, the most important thing going into this is that those areas where Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have common cause, say that rule 40-B to block out another candidate from being entered into the nomination, those are the areas where it's least likely you're going to see changes. So Kasich may be on the outside looking in when it comes to something like rule 40-B and --WALLACE:  Because that means he couldn't have his name even placed in nomination for the first ballot?DINAN: Entered for the nomination. Correct. That's correct. And then, you know, beyond that, you also -- it's not just -- depending on how they write the rules, what they do with the rules, it could go beyond the first ballot as well.Look, the main issue here is that Ted Cruz, he desperately wants us to be a two man fight, him versus Donald Trump. His numbers absolutely -- he has gained support from those other people when the other candidates drop out. The problem right now is that with these three candidates -- I mean you look at the -- the first four contests we had, you know, Iowa through Nevada, you had Donald Trump got about 33 percent of the vote there. Ted Cruz got about 21 percent of vote. John Kasich got 8 percent of the vote. Except for the day that you had Ohio voting, John Kasich has never really gotten much beyond that. The other support has actually gone between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. But, still, as long as he's getting that 15 percent or so, you're going to have a three man race. The nomination won't be settled before then.WALLACE:  I want to go back to that autopsy that I was talking about with Chairman Priebus, the autopsy after 2012 in which the party studied the problems, why Mitt Romney lost, and said we've got to reach out to minorities, we've got to reach out to -- to women. We've got to reach out to young people. And then you see the -- the trouble they're in, especially that Trump is in. And Ted Cruz also certainly the fastest voting bloc in America is Hispanics. And he, I would think, is going to have a tough sell with them as well.CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: Well, the obvious Achilles heel of that new rebranding strategy has turned out to be the GOP primary electorate, which is dominated by the traditional GOP base of older white voters. And it's gotten even worse for them from the point of view of Trump because what he excites are the most, if you want to say, nationalistic of -- of that segment, the people who are most hostile to all these new voter demographics that they were trying to reach out. So they, from the point of view that post-2012 autopsy, they've gone in reverse and they are facing a tremendous problem of -- of rebranding, not just from 2012, but rebranding now from their own primary race in 2016.WALLACE:  Briefly, George, I asked Priebus about this. He says, well, you know, there's a long time between the convention and November. You really think so?WILL: It's a -- I have to set a land speed record for healing to get well with all the people that have been offended by this campaign.WALLACE:  All right, we have to take a break here.Up next, despite trailing in the delegate count, Bernie Sanders seems to be getting under Hillary Clinton's skin.Plus, what do you think? Is a string of losses starting to bother the Democratic frontrunners? Let me know on Facebook or Twitter @foxnewssunday and use the #fns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am so sick, I am so sick of the Sanders' campaign lying about me. I'm sick of it.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT., DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: These are not just workers in the fossil fuel industry; these are paid, registered lobbyists. Secretary Clinton, you owe our campaign an apology. We were telling the truth.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Hillary Clinton feeling the heat from Bernie Sanders over his charges that she's getting big dollars from the fossil fuel industry. And we're back now with the panel.Well, this became a hot issue in the Democratic campaign this week when Hillary Clinton respond so vigorously to that Greenpeace protester. The campaign maintains that they have gotten no money from either oil or gas political action committees, PACs. But the Sanders camp says that industry employees, and that's what you heard there, including lobbyists, have given $300,000 to her campaign, have raised another $1.5 million for her campaign and have given more than $3 million to super PACs that are supporting Clinton.So, Julie, what does this argument say about where this race stands now?PACE: It's really interesting when you look at those numbers because actually when you look at the whole of the fundraising on the Democratic side, that's a pretty miniscule portion of this. This is more about Sander knowing that he has an argument that really irks the Clinton campaign. And that is this idea that she is influenced and bought by her donors, whether it's the fossil fuel industry, whether it's Wall Street, that argument bother hers because her campaign feels like he's not making the connection. He's implying this but he's never showing an example of how she has been bought or influenced. You saw her frustration start to really boil over there.And I don't necessarily think that this will change the dynamic in the Democratic Race substantially, but the overall point that Sanders is making is one that really motivates his supporters and Democrats broadly, this idea that there's too much money in politics and that he's the only one that is willing to completely upend the system. That she is still part of the system. She may want to tweak around the edges, but that he is the only one who will really push for a complete overhaul.WALLACE:  And we should point out that the reason they're talking about the fossil fuel industry and not Wall Street is because there's a big debate in New York, that primary on April 19th, about fracking. So that has become an industry that's being targeted right now.George, Bernie Sanders has won five of the last six contests. He's leading in the polls in Wisconsin. He's closing the gap, not all the way there, but closing the gap in New York. What is going on?WILL: We have all these complicated algorithms and other metrics for deciphering what's going on. Use your eyes. Look at a group of Clinton supporters. Look at a group of Sanders' supporters. Who's having the most fun? Bernie Sanders is fun. Hers is the joyless pursuit of joy kind of enshrouded in entitlement and all the rest. He just goes out, he's having -- he's energized people, who I think are having the fun of being naughty. They think being a socialist is kind of out there. Nothing much to the content of social -- he wants to redistribute a lot of wealth. That's all the federal government does anyway is redistribute wealth. I don't know what the excitement is. But this -- this -- this fun registers itself in one great number.In March he raised $44 million. That's an astonishing, particularly for a campaign that says the whole -- America is dominated by millionaires and billionaires. He's finding plenty of money in the energy, probably more energy than shown in small donors in any campaign --WALLACE:  Yes, we should point out, smallly (ph) energy, not energy industry, right?WILL: Yes. Small -- small donors. Probably a larger percentage than anyone since Barry Goldwater in 1964.WALLACE:  Meanwhile, as if that wasn't enough, four of Clinton's top former advisors at the State Department have all hired the same lawyer to handle possible investigation by the FBI of her private e-mails and her private e-mail server and there are reports that the FBI is going to interview Clinton herself sooner rather than later.Chuck is our legal expert. What does all that tell you?LANE: It tells me that fortunately for America this may be coming to a head and that a recommendation about whether or not to indict Hillary Clinton may soon be forthcoming from the FBI. And I say fortunately because whatever you think about the merits of these charges, she is running for president. She is likely to be the Democratic nominee. And we need some information about whether or not she's criminally liable or not before this, you know, gets to October or something like that. The fairest situation is one in which we find out sooner rather than later. And --WALLACE:  Give us your time line. When you -- you know, when you hear that -- that the aides are lawyering up, that there's talk about her having -- I mean are we talking weeks? Are we still talking months?LANE: Look, it -- you know, how long is a piece of string? But it looks to me like May or June this thing would have to come to a head. And certainly, you know, I have a lot of respect for Jim Comey. I think most people do.WALLACE:  We should point out, the FBI director.LANE: The FBI director. He is a fundamentally -- has a -- has a reputation as a fundamentally fair person. He must understand how political this is. And he's got a dilemma. And I think the -- the sensible thing to do in that situation is to move this thing forward, you know, between May and June and -- and, you know, lay it out there for the -- for --WALLACE:  If he doesn't make -- if they don't make a criminal referral, there's also the question of an indictment. But the first thing the FBI has to decide is if they're going to --LANE: Right.WALLACE:  Refer criminal charges to the attorney general to decide. Is there the possibility of a report?LANE: Of course there's a possibility of a report. And not only a possibility, but I would think probably a likelihood. Given how high profile this thing has been, they're -- going to have to lay out some kind of findings to back up whatever decision it is that they announce. They can't just say, well, we've decided not to indict her, end -- end of story. They're going to have to provide more information.WALLACE:  And would that be the FBI or would that be the attorney general?LANE: That would -- I mean the FBI would provide the -- as I understand it, the raw data to the Justice Department, which would then authorize such a report.WALLACE:  So -- so, Stephen, I mean, just wrap your head around this, indictment, criminal referral, report. None of those, obviously indictment by far the worst, but none of those would be good for Hillary Clinton headed into her convention.DINAN: No, absolutely not.WALLACE:  Unless -- unless the report is a complete exoneration.DINAN: Well, even then when you're -- the possibility you're left with is that FBI agents, who would have wanted to have gone the other direction, do start leaking their own interpretation of the facts they came across. So this gets messy at best and very bad at worst.LANE: Can I just add something that -- you know, think about the politics of this. Bernie Sanders gave this issue away. So within the Democratic Party, this is not a liability for Hillary. She's got other liabilities, but not this one. And as you look to November, if she's running against Trump, who we've just been discussing how unpopular and everything he is, it's not clear to me that however bad this gets, unless of course it's an indictment, it's enough to outweigh Trump's negatives. So I think she's broadly heading toward being in the clear on this.WALLACE:  George, do you buy that?WILL: On the other hand, May could be a very exciting month because, as you say, the FBI investigation could come to a head and it is possible, if the judge has his way, that Donald Trump in May could be testifying in a fraud trial having to do with Trump University, which was something short of Oxford.WALLACE:  But -- but do you buy the argument that -- that because of the fact that -- that Bernie Sanders -- I'm not sure I agree that he gave it away. He just said, he's not going to press it himself. Do you really think Democratic voters are going to want to nominate somebody -- again, all speculative -- that indictment's one thing, but there was a criminal referral that was not acted on or even a very negative report, you don't think that would be damaging?WILL: It would be terribly damaging. It would be damaging on top of the mountain of evidence that she is having trouble connecting with an electorate that already, by a majority, views her unfavorably.PAGE: At the same time, Democratic voters, I think, are making their choice. If you look at Hillary Clinton's lead in pledged delegates, her lead in the overall vote, her lead in the super delegates, the party establishment that is looking toward the general election, she leads in all of those categories. So there is a choice being made, the e-mail situation has been out there, whether Bernie Sanders is racing it or not, and she is still winning.DINAN: Two quick points on -- May could be interesting and June could be interesting for Hillary Clinton legally because she's likely to face discovery over what the State Department and how she ran her own e-mail server. So there are other things that could come out, even outside of the actual criminal justice process with some of these open records requests.
