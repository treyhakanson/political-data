This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JESSE JACKSON, JR., D-ILL.: I reject and denounce pay to play politics, and have no involvement whatsoever in any wrongdoing.I did not initiate or authorize anyone at any time to promise anything to Governor Blagojevich on my behalf. I never sent a message or an emissary to the governor to make an offer, to plead my case, or to propose a deal about a U.S. Senate seat, period.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRIT HUME, HOST: Congressman Jesse Jackson, son of the Reverend Jesse Jackson, saying today that, despite the fact that Patrick Fitzgerald, the prosecutor in the Blagojevich case, said that someone purporting to act on his behalf had offered a half million dollars in campaign contributions in exchange for Blagojevich's appointment of young Jackson to be the senator succeeding Barack Obama, he had nothing to do with any such effort and didn't authorize it in any way.That was the latest in the saga of Rod Blagojevich and his case today.Some thoughts on all this now from Jeff Birnbaum, managing editor at The Washington Times; Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National Public Radio, and the syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer -- FOX News contributors all.Well, that was a pretty comprehensive denial by young Jackson that he authorized no such contacts to be made. His lawyer said who knows might have done it acting on his behalf. Where are we are in all this, Jeff?JEFF BIRNBAUM, COLUMNIST, THE WASHINGTON TIMES: Well, I think we're into the distraction mode. I think that President-elect Obama is learning the hard way and very early that even though he may not personally have been involved in a scandal, and I think we should believe the federal prosecutors about that, that if people he is associated --HUME: All he said is he makes no such allegations. He didn't say that it didn't happen. I'm not saying it did. I'm just saying there has been no indication of that. But he has not simply exonerated him.BIRNBAUM: No, he has not. But there is just a lot that someone in the position of president or president-elect has to deal with.The term of art is ""distraction."" What it means is that almost anything that happens with people who are associated with him that raise the prospect of problems for him, that may actually lead to real problems, but even the prospect of problems makes his life much more difficult.And that's what we're seeing here. We're likely to see days and days of this. Whether Barack Obama is part of Chicago politics, we'll see a lot. I think that notion will always be in voters' minds, whether he was separate from it, or a part of it and tainted by it.I think that this is just a cold splash in the face to Obama on this issue, that he is going to have to deal with all sorts of things that happen that are often beyond his control.HUME: Mara, Obama said yesterday that he wasn't going to say anything beyond the fact that he didn't know of any such efforts and that he had had no discussions with Blagojevich about this. But he would not say, and will not say, whether anyone representing him did.Does that put him in a position where he has an unanswered question hanging out there that won't go away until it gets answered?MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Yes, I think it does.I mean, what we have learned certainly through all of the Clinton scandals is the first instinct of politicians is to separate themselves from the taint. But in doing that, sometimes they can raise more questions, and it has the exact opposite effect than the one they intended.He said he never talked to Blagojevich about this. It turns out in pretty short order there was a November 23 tape of David Axelrod saying that he had.(CROSSTALK)LIASSON: And then Axelrod fell on the sword and said ""I misspoke.""HUME: If anybody in the Obama entourage would be likely to know what went on with Blagojevich, it would be Axelrod, because, after all, he was the political consultant for both of them.LIASSON: There is nothing wrong or surprising about the fact that somebody, either Obama himself or Axelrod, or Rahm Emanuel, might have talked with Rod Blagojevich, somebody who they have close tie with politically, about who might be the successor -- not that they would be pushing anyone in particular, but certainly talked about it.Not only is that not surprising, I would be shocked if it didn't happen. And there is nothing wrong with it if it did. It is just that when Obama said I didn't talk about it, they had to square the circle and get that messy, contradictory quote of Axelrod's expunged, which they have done now.But there is more to come. Did Rahm Emanuel talk to him? Did someone else from the team talk to him? And, in and of itself, there is nothing wrong with that happening. It's just that every time you don't answer a question fully, it keeps the thing alive.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I would agree. If a governor is appointing a successor to a senator, any senator, you would expect he or his staff to discuss that with the governor. But, you're right, because of the fact that Axelrod, when he walked it back, specifically said there were no direct discussions between Obama and the governor, that implies that there were intermediaries, which you would expect and I'm sure we're going to hear about.And, in fact, from the tapes, the governor is heard saying, complaining that Obama is not offering anything if he chooses the Obama favorite except appreciation.HUME: He must have gotten that idea from somebody.KRAUTHAMMER: From somebody, and the question will be who is it, and we'll learn that. But it appears innocent.What we're getting here is a belated interest in the national press about the muck out of which Obama rose. Local press has always had an interest in Rezko, Jeremiah Wright, William Ayers. But in the national press, during the election of the anointed one, the national press was not interested or even declared a lot of these associations off limits.It's not to say that you can't have a corrupt association or associations with others who are corrupt in the past. Truman was a member of the Pendergrass machine in Kansas City and ended up a great president. So it's not a forecast of what kind of President Obama will be.But he certainly arises out of a tainted environment. And now, all of a sudden, it's been discovered that's where he came from, while, I would add, promising the new, uncorrupt, and transcendent kind of policy.HUME: One quick last question -- does what has happened now eliminate Jackson as a potential senator appointment?KRAUTHAMMER: Absolutely.LIASSON: As an appointment, but maybe there will be a special election, which sounds like the more likely outcome.BIRNBAUM: I think we're unlikely to have Senator Jackson.HUME: Even if there is a special election?BIRNBAUM: Even if there is a special election.HUME: When we come back, President Bush certainly isn't acting like a lame duck. We'll talk about that next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. HARRY REID, D-NEV., SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: I haven't been a big fan of the White House, as everyone knows, for the last eight years. But they have, in good faith, worked with us trying to get a piece of legislation that we can bring before this body. And that's one reason it's taken so long.But President Bush is still the president of the United States and he has tremendous power.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUME: Huh? I thought he was a lame duck with no power. Well, live and learn, I guess, huh?That's Harry Reid, of course, talking about -- the Democratic leader in the Senate, talking about the bailout automobile bridge loan bailout bill that is in the process of passing the House of Representatives and faces an uncertain future in the Senate.Charles, what about the president's role and what about the bill?KRAUTHAMMER: Well, this is the most active and important lame duck presidency in American history. Huge interventions in the markets, the signing of an agreement with Iraq of tremendous importance, the status of forces agreement, and now the intervention on the issue of the bailout.I mean, this is a duck that roared, that people will remember historically.For all the ridicule that the president has incurred from Barney Frank and others about his lack of leadership, he's leading here. And what he's doing on the auto issue is he's trying to enforce, essentially, a bankruptcy procedure of sorts.What he is trying to do is to get the czar to have the automatic obligation to recall the loans if it's determined that the stakeholders in the auto crisis, the unions, the management, the dealers, and the bond holders aren't really taking a cut, a haircut.If so, the loans are recalled, the companies collapse, they end up in Chapter 11, and a judge will do it.And that, I think, Democrats had attempted to weaken that power of recalling the loan. But now it appears in the bill. It remains automatic.HUME: And the czar would be named by?KRAUTHAMMER: Bush, and retained by Obama.LIASSON: Look, I think the president -- this is the most consequential transition, certainly. Look at what has happened since Election Day. It is extraordinary.But I do think the real test of his ability to still quack like a duck is if he can get those Republican senators who are currently holding up this auto deal to come into line.HUME: But if they fail, it wouldn't be the worst outcome from Bush's perspective?LIASSON: No, it wouldn't. But that would be a real test. If he wants this to pass, the problem right now is Republican senators, and we will see if he has clout with them.HUME: Republican senators, a handful of them, say four or five, are talking about a filibuster, which would mean it would take 60 votes to end the filibuster. Cloture, as it's called -- that's the measure to end the filibuster--has already been filed, I believe, by Harry Reid.Jeff, what is your sense of where the votes are?BIRNBAUM: Senator Voinovich of Ohio, who is in favor of the bridge loan, said earlier today that he doesn't think that there are enough votes to pass the bailout bill in the Senate.HUME: Over a filibuster?BIRNBAUM: Over a filibuster.I'm not sure if he's right though. President Bush, I think, is roaring like a duck, to use Charles' phrase here, because he not only has shaped the bailout bill, but sent his chief of staff and also Vice President Cheney to the Hill to talk to Republican to try to change their mind and persuade them that not passing this bill could lead to a catastrophe.The only other time that a bailout was not offered, in the case of Lehman brothers very early in this, when money was denied to Lehman Brothers to keep it afloat, that's what led to the collapse. And he wants to avoid.And he sees that as an important part of his legacy here. And so I think that he may actually get enough votes to get this thing to pass.HUME: Let's assume for the sake of argument that he doesn't.It wouldn't be all that different from the czar that he will be naming finding, after a matter of weeks, really, that Detroit has not lived up to what the Congress expected of them in terms of changing everything, in terms of the stakeholders, as Charles described, taking the necessary haircuts an major changes being made.That would lead to the very kind of outcome we would have if the thing failed, wouldn't it?LIASSON: The outcome would be very similar, but I think it would make a huge amount of difference politically.(CROSSTALK)BIRNBAUM: That's right. It would be a huge political difference. And, also, it would be blood on the president's hands, basically, here.I do think that even if it does fail once, it will pass a second time if it's brought up on Capitol Hill.HUME: Before the end of the Bush presidency?BIRNBAUM: Yes, in the same way that it took two times before the big $700 billion bailout passed.And I think the president will once again prove that he is a factor in this by making sure that even at an initial failure will be retried.HUME: Do you think it will pass in the end, Mara?LIASSON: Yes, I do.KRAUTHAMMER: Ironically, the Democrats are short one seat, Obama's in Illinois -- it's vacant -- in trying get to 60 if they want cloture.HUME: Wow.Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2008 FOX News Network, LLC.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MITT ROMNEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is the day that's going to change, I believe, the politics in the nation as we get ready to select our nominee. I think Michigan is vote for Romney again. I'm planning on it.SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We think it's important, and we're competitive, and we're doing well in South Carolina, we're doing well nationwide. But a month ago we would have had a very different assessment.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRIT HUME, HOST: Usually when one candidate says he's going to win, the other one says he expects to do well. That's sign somebody is playing down expectations. But after what happened in New Hampshire, and perhaps elsewhere, nobody is relying on that sort of thing very much.Some thoughts about this Michigan primary now from Fred Barnes, Executive Editor of ""The Weekly Standard,"" Mort Kondracke, Executive Editor of ""Roll Call,"" Bill Kristol, Editor of ""The Weekly Standard,"" and Nina Easton, Washington Bureau Chief for ""Fortune"" Magazine, FOX News contributors all.We can get a quick look here at the way the average of polling stood as the people went to vote today in the Michigan Republican primary. There is no real contest on the Democratic side because Hillary Clinton is the only name on the ballot. But there you see it, by contemporary standards, that is no margin at all. So it looked to be a toss up going in.We do know a little bit, however, now about how people voted in what groups and why. So what, Fred Barnes, are we learning from the voting patterns we've seen as a result of the exit polling? It is an incomplete sample. It certainly doesn't tell us who won the race, but we know something about voting patterns.FRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Right. I think the single most important thing is that the voters in the Republican primary believe that the economy is by far the biggest issue, over half of them.And so what you need is an economic message. You need to appeal to economic conservatives, who are what the Republicans are: economic conservatives.And the truth is Romney has a stronger one, particularly just for Michigan, which is the one state that is the worst of the 50 states. I think it is the worst off economically in the country, even worse off than Louisiana. And Louisiana has the excuse of Katrina. Michigan doesn't have an excuse. It's an economy in a real tailspin.And Romney focused on that, you know, particularly --HUME: He came out in New Hampshire and started talking about the economy.BARNES: Right away. And, unfortunately, McCain doesn't seem to have adjusted to this economic issue here --HUME: At least immediately.BARNES: Well, no, I don't think at all, actually.HUME: Really?BARNES: Well, look, what is he talking about? He has talked about we're going to -- he's arguing -- he's now saying that when he voted against the Bush tax cuts that that was the right vote. If you saw him, he's ducking his argument that he used to have. He used to be very strong for entitlement reform in the debate that FOX had him a few days ago. He was talking well, we'll have a commission. For economic conservatives, they know that when you have a bipartisan commission, that is a cover for raising taxes.And McCain -- the truth is, Romney has had a better message here for Michigan conditions than McCain has.HUME: So the fact that voters were most concerned about that would favor Romney?BARNES: Absolutely.HUME: Not necessarily decisively, but would favor Romney.MORT KONDRAKE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, ROLL CALL: There is not contest on the Democratic side, but you can vote for ""uncommitted."" Hillary Clinton is the only person with a name on the ballot, and you can vote for ""uncommitted."" And it looks as though African-Americans loaded heavily in favor of ""uncommitted"" over her, which suggests a protest vote against this racial stuff that's been going on back and forth between her and Barack Obama and their supporters.So that is the interesting thing to watch tonight.HUME: On the Democratic side.KONDRACKE: I agree with Fred that Romney had a message focused at the rehabilitation, the economic rehabilitation of Michigan, much stronger than McCain did.At the end of the game, McCain started talking about how green technology would bring back the Michigan economy, but it was late in the game, and Romney, whose father, after all, ran American motors at one time, and was the governor here, identified himself as a hometown boy, and also said it was personal.Now, was his message conservative? I mean, he says that Washington will make it its responsibility --HUME: Who?KONDRACKE: Romney -- Washington will make it its responsibility to help out the auto industry. Well, why not the textile industry? Why not the mining industry, et cetera?HUME: Bill.BILL KRISTOL, EDITOR, ""THE WEEKLY STANDARD"": He'll probably say that Washington should help out the textile industry in South Carolina, and it will probably work.I think on economics, Fred is absolutely right. What McCain has gotten so much good press for -- global warming; he is the most liberal or green Republican on that -- CAF standards.HUME: You mean fuel economy standards mandated by the government.. KRISTOL: Right, which would impose a burden on automakers in Detroit.Michigan has 7.4 percent unemployment and a lot of people losing jobs in the auto industry and satellite industry, suddenly being a great hero of environmentalists doesn't work so well.And, secondly, he didn't make it Commander-in-Chief election in Michigan. It was an economics election, and I think Romney probably got an edge on him.HUME: But he did have one ace in the hole, which is what helped him so much eight years ago, and that was the fact that independents and, indeed, Democrats can vote in the Republican primary out there. The early voting tells us something about that -- Nina?NINA EASTON, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, ""FORTUNE"" MAGAZINE: And no surprise, Independents will be going for McCain.I think the big question -- I have to do my full disclosure that my husband works for Romney -- but the big thing to watch tonight is how McCain does with Republican voters. He lost them, keep in mind, by one point in New Hampshire.Regardless of whether he is a victor or not tonight, how will he do on core Republican voters?HUME: Right, and do we know --KONDRACKE: What's important on that score is that down the line, you will get into primaries where Independents can't join in the contest. It's a Republicans only primary, and if Romney can capture the regular Republicans he's got a chance to win the nomination.KRISTOL: Romney is winning Republican's easily.If you look at the exit polls, they don't look that different between New Hampshire and Michigan. The same basic pattern --HUME: So the question is the Michigan Independent vote.KRISTOL: Right. Michigan has a bigger Republican vote relative to the Independent vote, it looks like. And the Michigan electorate seems to be a little more conservative than the New Hampshire electorate.HUME: OK.When we come back, speaking of getting economies going, is Washington going to work up an economic stimulus package? The president says he's considering it. The Democrats are all for one. We'll talk about what it might be next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HUME: That's the opening bell on Wall Street. Look at end of the day. The final number, I think, was 277, but as the closing bell rang, it was sitting on 281 down. That, folks, is a bad day.And that sort of thing has Washington worried, and indeed much of the country worried that we might now be headed into an undeniable recession.Back with our panel on that -- Washington on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, there is talk of a stimulus package. Where is this likely to go? We've been here before. There have been a lot of stimulus packages passed. What about it, Nina?EASTON: We forget that there was a downturn at the tail end of an election year in 2000.And, look, I'm not an economist, and I don't play one on TV, but I did talk to a lot of economists recently about this, everything that's going on, and the concern is that where we're heading with these tax rebates, it's very similar to the 2001 initial tax package where the reliance was on the short-term stimulus -- you get a $600 check in the mail.A lot of the talk that is going on today both among Democrats and some of the administration is that short-term money in the economy --HUME: Barack Obama is talking $250 for everybody?EASTON: For everybody, and another $250 Social Security on top of that for Social Security recipients.But the problem when you talk to economists is that in 2001, it didn't do anything. What really mattered was the long-term -- once the long-term tax cuts kicked in, which some of them were also passed in 2001, more in 2003 -- once those kicked in, and cuts an capital gains an dividend cut and personal income cuts, that helped turn around the economy by 2003.KRISTOL: Bush should call for making those making those cuts permanent, and will, certainly, in the State of the Union. I think the White House will go for a stimulus package. I think they are right to, politically. I think it is a total win-win.HUME: What about economically?KRISTOL: Economically it's not going to make much difference. But it won't do much damage, it's not like the deficit is so great. And people could use a little more money. I would do a tax credit for people who work, something refundable against FICA, against a Social Security tax. If Bush can get a deal with Pelosi and Reid, and they agree that we're going to have a mostly tax cut, not too much government spending type of to a stimulus package, it's great for the administration. I think it takes the economic issue away from the Democrats to some degree. They just agreed on a stimulus package, they can't going around beating up the president or the Republican Party so much. And it probably would help a little bit to get some money into people's pockets.But it has to be a tax cut heavy stimulus package, not a spending package.HUME: Aren't the Democrats the one that you have to have pay as you go, and that any spending or tax cutting you do has to be offset by other tax increases or by spending cuts? What happened to that talk? That's gone out the window.KONDRACKE: That's what you do if you don't think you're headed into a recession, you can go for pay-go. But if you believe in Keynesian economics, and all the Democrats do --HUME: It sounds like Bill does, too.KRISTOL: To some degree, a nice combination of supply side and Keynesian economics.KONDRACKE: -- then you want deficit spending, and deficit spending is perfectly all right.The danger would be as what happened in 1992 when George Bush had a Democratic Congress and the Democrats insisted on short-term money in people's hands, and he insisted on capital gains taxes, and vetoed what they did. The economy did go into a recession, and Bill Clinton won the election, declaring that this was the worst recession since the Great Depression.But if we do go into a recession, it's going to be bad for Republicans, presumably, in the general election. And so that's another reason why Bush, I think, will consider it.HUME: Quickly, Fred.BARNES: The problem when they sent out the checks in 2001, $600 to couples -- listen if they send them out again this year, I promise to spend the money!HUME: OK.Content and Programming Copyright 2008 FOX News Network, LLC.

Serge Toussaint was paid $3,000 by the Liberty City Community Revitalization Trust to complete a Martin Luther King Jr. themed piece as part of a beautification project.The project was supposed to include a mural of blue skies, clouds and quotes from Dr. King along MLK Boulevard. But Toussaint added a painting of Obama to the mural arguing, ""What's the point of painting Martin Luther King Jr. if you can't paint his dream?""But the Florida Department of Transportation received complaints that the painting was an unfair political endorsement. Toussaint has since painted over Obama's face, but says he has gotten an earful about using white primer. He says he is being accused of ""whitewashing"" Obama.Out of SyncColin Kahl, a key adviser to Barack Obama's campaign, is recommending that 60-80,000 troops should be kept in Iraq as late as 2010. That is at odds with Obama's pledge to withdraw forces from Iraq within 16 months of taking office.According to The New York Sun, Kahl wrote a paper for the Center for New American Security which states, ""the U.S. should aim to transition to a sustainable over-watch posture of perhaps 60,000 to 80,000 by the end of 2010.""Kahl is the day-to-day coordinator of Obama's working group on Iraq, but says his written views have nothing to do with the senator's campaign. Foreign policy adviser Susan Rice has said that Obama's pledge is a goal -- not a commitment -- and that advice from the military and facts on the ground will weigh heavily on troop movements.Chilling FactsGlobal temperatures will drop slightly this year as a result of the cooling effect of La Nina air and ocean currents in the Pacific. That's according to the United Nation's chief meteorologist Michelle Jarraud. This means that global temperatures have not risen for a decade and Jarraud says the data cast further doubt on some global warming theories.Jarraud told the BBC that La Nina will continue into the summer, causing temperatures across the globe to drop by a fraction of a degree. The phenomenon has contributed significantly to this year's torrential rains in Australia and some of the coldest temperatures on record across China.Picture Not So Perfect?White House officials are criticizing The New York Times for publishing a photo they see as editorially unfair.Accompanying an article on Friday about this week's NATO summit in Romania, The Times included a very large photo -- almost half a page in size -- that showed President Bush standing somewhat alone. The shot was taken moments before the NATO group photo, as leaders were looking for their positions on the platform. But President Bush had obviously found his.White House deputy press secretary Tony Fratto said, ""Only The New York Times would choose a photo of the president standing alone during a week when NATO allies instead stood shoulder-to-shoulder with him on our security policies.""President Bush achieved two major goals during this week's summit: NATO leaders unanimously endorsed the proposed U.S. missile defense system in Europe and agreed to provide more troops for the war in Afghanistan.-- FOX News Channel's Martin Hill contributed to this report."
3	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2010/03/23/panel-democrats-getting-votes-pass-health-care-reform/	Panel on Democrats Getting the Votes to Pass Health Care Reform	"This is a rush transcript of ""Special Report With Bret Baier"" from March 22, 2010. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Tonight, at a time when the pundits said it was no lo nger possible, we rose above the weight of our politics. This is what change looks like.SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, R-ARIZ.: We will challenge this in the courts. We will challenge this all over America. And the will of the people will be heard. They do not like this process. They do not like this product. And we will prevail over time. I am confident of that.SOUTH CAROLINA ATTORNEY GENERAL HENRY MCMASTER: Nowhere does it say that the federal government can require a private citizen to go out and buy health insurance or anything else.ROBERT GIBBS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I think there is pretty long standing precedent on the constitutionality of this. My advice from counsel is that we will win these lawsuits.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Reaction to the historic passage of the health care bill by the House of Representatives on Sunday night, the White House touting what's going to kick in right away, Republicans vowing to repeal it and challenge it in court. And now it moves on to the Senate to be fixed. Let's bring in our panel, Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, Mort Kondracke, executive editor of Roll Call, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. No matter what side you are on on this bill, Mort, this was a big, big development for this White House and House Democrats.MORT KONDRAKE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, ROLL CALL: Yes, a tremendous victory. They pulled this back from the edge of defeat. It looked as though it was going to not get passed, and they managed to bring it across the line. And the good news about it is if it goes into effect in 2014, if John McCain doesn't manage to stop it somehow on the beaches or in the air drones or wherever he is going to fight the battle of Britain, 32 million people who now lack health insurance are going to have health insurance. The problem is that it doesn't control cost. The deficit is going to balloon. The country is going to go bankrupt on paying entitlement cost. There should have been a better way to do this than the way they did it. But it's done, and it doesn't look as though it's going to be repealed. The Republicans, if they win the next election, are not going to be able to repeal it because Obama would veto the repeal amendment. So, and I hope that the Republicans will not campaign simply on repealing it but, as Paul Ryan said on ""Fox News Sunday,"" repeal it and replace it with something that will cover the uninsured.BAIER: Bill, what about that, the repeal movement?BILL KRISTOL, EDITOR, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: I think the Republicans will run on repealing it and replace it. You have to repeal it before you can replace it. It can't be repealed in 2011 because President Obama will still be president. But most of it does not go into effect until 2014.So we can run -- the Republicans can run congressional elections and a presidential election against this piece of legislation, and I think they can make a compelling case that this legislation will bankrupt the government and bankrupt the country and damage American health care.Decline is a choice. I think someone once said that. And I think Republicans and some conservative Democrats can go to the public and say, is this really the choice you want to make? Is this -- building in these costs, damaging the health care system -- the implications of it are so terrible with the debt we already have, I think the public could -- I think this can be repealed.BAIER: But yet within six months you are going to have the coverage can't be dropped because of illness, children can stay on their parents' plan until 26. These things -- insurance would not impose lifetime benefit caps. These are things that people can feel immediately so Democrats can cash in on that within six months. True?KRISTOL: Yes and no. Repealing it doesn't mean repealing every little thing in it necessarily. Parts of these were parts of Republican proposals. Republican are for risk pools to make it possible for everyone to be insured and not to be dropped because of preexisting condition. That's part of Paul Ryan's proposal and the House Republican proposal that was rejected.But I think -- two points. There's this too simpleminded view of the American public, that if you give them something and they won't ever think of the public good. They won't ever think it's bankrupting the country. They won't ever think it's a step on the road to decline and say I got this little benefit so I'm going to hang on to this whole terrible piece of legislation that is so bad.And secondly, how many people really benefit from this? If one wants to go into this crude argument of self-interest. The reason that Medicare and Social Security could never be repealed and were so popular is they were universal benefits. Everyone got them. This does not universally benefit most Americans.Obama himself keeps saying, hey, if you like your current health insurance, it's not going to change. Well, if it's not going to change with this, it's not going to change without it. So a lot of these benefits are very targeted to some individuals. I think there a ways the Republicans can argue to help these individuals without everything else that's bad in this bill.So I think the repeal agenda is a real agenda and I think that's what Republicans are going to run on.BAIER: Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: The first question is will the courts act on this. I think there is a very good case, a very strong case you can make that the Commerce Clause has never been used to force an individual to engage in a contract with a private institution, i.e. an insurance company here.Although, so I think there is a strong case. But I cannot imagine that the courts will overturn a piece of legislation this large. So, just as a practical prediction on this, I think it's unlikely, although I'd love to see Justice Alito write the overturning opinion.But then I think there is a larger issue here. I think ultimately Obama understands that he has just added an unbelievably large entitlement onto a country drowning in debt. He is not stupid. I think he's anticipated this, and I think he has, from the beginning, had a plan.And the plan is he is going to use the deficit reduction commission, which will report only after November, and I'm absolutely sure it will recommend something new in American history, a national sales tax which is called a VAT in Europe. All the Europeans who have the kind of entitlements America is now going to have, health care and all the others, need the VAT, because it's a gusher of income for the government. And once you have that, even at very small levels - a percent or two of national sales tax -- that's how the liberals think they will be able to fund this new, very expanded entitlement state.It's the way it's done in Europe. It's going to have to be done here. And that, I think, is going to be the argument in the president's election of 2012.BAIER: Quickly Mort, now the bill, the reconciliation fixes that were passed by the House now head to the Senate, debate likely starting shortly after the president signs this bill into law. That potentially could get messy.KONDRACKE: It could get messy. It's going to be long and drawn out. The Republicans are promising hundreds of amendments.And also there is this question about Social Security being affected by the terms of the reconciliation bill passed by the House, and that's a no-no under reconciliation. So if a point of order is sustained on that, 60 votes, then the bill would have to be -- would not be identical to the one that the House passed. So the House would have to pass the reconciliation bill again.I cannot believe they wouldn't do that if they had to. I mean, they have marched over so many coals already that I cannot believe that they wouldn't do it one more time in order to get this accomplishment sealed.KRAUTHAMMER: There is a scenario under which the vice president, who has the power to overrule the parliamentarian, would arbitrarily overrule him on this and, for example, allow a change in Social Security. I think that would be a terrible mistake.BAIER: You've previously called that the thermal nuclear option.KRAUTHAMMER: It was a hundred mega tons, because I think it will be the ultimate demonstration of high-handedness. And I suspect that even Biden would flinch from doing that.BAIER: Does it get through the Senate?KRISTOL: I think some bill will get through the Senate. It won't be identical to the House bill, so if will have to go back to the House.And this debate will be useful, because even if you take the kind of low self-interest point of view about the American public that all they care about is immediate cost and benefits, there are a lot of immediate costs in this bill.The Obama defenders keep saying oh, the American public is going to get this benefit and this benefit and fall in love with it. They will get tax increases next year, which the Republicans will highlight on the Senate floor. Medicare Advantage, which is a very popular program for seniors is going to be cut.So I think even in the short-term this bill imposes, in my view, more pain than gain.BAIER: There is much more on health care reform on our homepage Focnews.com/specialreport. You can tell us what your strongest reaction is to the vote by participating in our online poll on the right side of the screen.We will be right back to talk about the U.S., Israel, and Iran in three minutes.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON: Let me be very clear. The United States is determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.(APPLAUSE)Our aim is not incremental sanctions but sanctions that will bite. It is taking time to produce these sanctions and we believe that time is a worthwhile investment for winning the broadest possible support for our efforts.But we will not compromise our commitment to preventing Iran from acquiring these nuclear weapons.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Secretary of State Clinton talking to Israel's largest U.S. lobbying group AIPAC today, talking about Iran. Meantime, Israel's opposition leader Tzipi Livni said this is time, waiting for China and Russia, that Israel does not have.We're back with our panel. Charles?KRAUTHAMMER: Those words we heard from the secretary of state -- I have rarely heard emptier words issued with such phony emphasis.I mean, ""We have a commitment. We were not compromised on our commitment."" They have done nothing in a year and two months. Last summer the secretary of state spoke about getting ready to impose crippling sanctions, and then here we are nine months later. They are talking about trying to organize a wide coalition to begin to talk about imposing sanctions.They have had nine months and they aren't even ready. The Chinese have said no. The Russians are equivocal and not giving any encouragement.To give you an idea how catastrophic is the state of this creating a coalition, she was in South America a few weeks ago and went to visit Brazil, which is on the Security Council, this session, asked for support on sanction and was told outright in a real slap at the United States, no.So, it isn't even getting in the big great powers into this tent. She can't even entice a middle power like Brazil that's traditionally a friend of the United States. They are doing nothing and they are going nowhere on this.BAIER: Secretary Clinton previously, Mort, said the U.S. is pushing for ""crippling sanctions."" Now they are sanctions ""with a bite.""KONDRACKE: I think a bite, a nip at your ankles is a lot less than crippling.And, you know, the idea that they are going to still persist in going to the United Nations after -- she was just in Russia, and she took a few words that the Russians said time is running out for the Iranians as a big sign things are moving in our direction.But at the same time the Russians said they are going to provide fuel for the shared nuclear reactor, which was a slap in the face at the same time which she never referred to in that speech.I was there when she made the speech, and she was sort of, you know, kind of warmly received because she has good applause lines. But everybody I talked to afterwards said the rhetoric was great but -- dot dot dot -- we have got to see the delivery. And the delivery ain't there.BAIER: The other issue, Bill, was obviously trying to smooth over the tensions with Israel. Earlier tonight we told you in Wendell Goler's report that the American pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC had issued and called on the Israeli government to: ""immediately freeze new settlement projects in West Bank and Jerusalem.""AIPAC says it did not do that, issue that statement. The spokesman said someone faked his e-mail address and issued a false statement. We regret this error in Wendell's piece tonight and are correcting it here.Bill, it was pretty detailed, this release.KRISTOL: Yes. Someone went to the trouble of getting the name of the AIPAC spokesman and constructing a fake e-mail which he sent out to some list, maybe hijacked his press list, and some people were unfortunately fooled. Anyway, it's not the case.BAIER: The bottom line is they tried to smooth over the relations over the settlement issue. Did she do it effectively?KRISTOL: It would nice be a fly on the wall at the meeting between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Obama tomorrow. I think they are both proud men who have strong views which don't coincide I would say on this issue. It will be interesting to see what the frank discussion is that they are going to have.I guess they are not opening it to the press either at the beginning or the end. Usually, as you know, they bring in the press at the beginning and toss a question to each leader and get the ""spray"" I think it's called, the photos and the two of them sitting in the two chairs.BAIER: Very good for a print guy.KRISTOL: I worked in the White House and I vaguely remember complaining, the vice president, there is the press again knocking over the flower pots and all of that.But they are not going to do that. It will be a private meeting between the two of them. And the bottom line is the U.S. government has wasted more time on the 1,500 housing units in a part of Jerusalem that's going to remain part of Israel under any conceivable agreement than in trying to get Iran to stop its nuclear program.BAIER: Charles, you knew right away this AIPAC statement was not where they were coming from. Do you think that the administration has gone enough to sooth the initial reaction that they had to --KRAUTHAMMER: The question is will they insist on no Jewish construction in Jerusalem. No government of Israel, left, right, or center, would ever accept that.So if it insists on that, which appeared it might have been a condition that the secretary of state had given the prime minister of Israel last week during the furious phone call, if it was, this is -- the entire process is at a halt. They are going to have to find a way to climb off that tree.Israel wants negotiations. It's the Palestinians who have said no negotiations unless you have got a freeze, which has never happened in the 17 years of U.S. -- of Israeli negotiations with the Palestinians.Content and Programming Copyright 2010 Fox News Network, LLC.

"Now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine:Presidential Politics in '08A new Rudy Giuliani beats New York Senator Hillary Clinton by 11 percentage points. And he wins over Massachusetts Senator John Kerry by 19 points.Arizona Senator John McCain tops Clinton by 13 points and beats out Kerry by 20 points.  Clinton is a polarizing figure. More voters say they would ""definitely"" vote for her than any other potential candidate. But more voters also say-- ""under no conditions"" would they vote for her than any of her rivals.Too Graphic?The National Right to Life Committee says an Illinois newspaper has deemed some of its advertisements too graphic to be published. The Joliet Herald News rejected 3 ads featuring sonogram photos of fetuses. One of the ads shows a box of tissues and a sonogram photo saying, ""Excuse me America, this is tissue, this isn't."" Cemetery ControversyThere's a new flashpoint in Jerusalem where a group of Israeli developers have begun excavating an ancient Muslim cemetery. An Islamic cleric has demanded an end to the project arguing that it is a desecration of sacred land. But Israel's Supreme Court has so far refused to issue a restraining order halting the project. The site is being cleared to build a Museum of Tolerance dedicated to promoting understanding among religions.No Protection?And former FEMA director Michael Brown has written a letter to the White House threatening to release all his communications with President Bush during Hurricane Katrina unless the administration forbids it and offers him legal representation. Brown, who left the federal payroll in November, says his status as a private citizen offers no protection under executive privilege. -- FOX News' Aaron Bruns contributed to this report"
