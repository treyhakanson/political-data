This is a rush transcript from ""Journal Editorial Report,"" October 22, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We will drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. --(CHEERING)TRUMP: --and replace it with a new government, of, and by, and for the people.I'm asking the American people to rise above the noise and the clutter of our broken politics, and embrace the great faith and optimism that has been the central ingredient in the American character.(END VIDEO CLIP)PAUL GIGOT, HOST: Welcome to the ""Journal Editorial Report."" I'm Paul Gigot.That was Donald Trump in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania today, previewing what the first 100 days of the Trump administration would look like. From the economy to national security to government ethics, the Republican nominee promised once in a lifetime change if he is elected November 8th. So with just over two weeks to go, will the plan he laid out help him close the polling gap with Hillary Clinton.Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, is here; and columnists, Mary Anastasia O'Grady; Bill McGurn and Kimberly Strassel.So, Dan, a new contract with America, closing argument, they advertised this for a couple of days, what did you make of it?DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Well, he calls it the contract with Donald J. Trump, and man, it was not a Hail Mary, there were 15 or 20 Hail Marys in there. A lot of things inside that.Let me say this on his behalf. There's more change in that speech than Hillary Clinton will produce for the rest of her life. No question about it.GIGOT: Right.HENNINGER: There was a lot. And there was a lot of good things at the end, on taxes and energy and regulation, specific proposals for tax reform and reforming the energy system.But, I think, let's cut to the chase, he doesn't have much time left and not many people saw that speech.GIGOT: Right.HENNINGER: But if he were to place ads in Pennsylvania, Florida, and Ohio, and North Carolina, then he can convey that message. But to do that, he has $35 million of cash on hand, Donald J. Trump has to put $65 million of his own money in to it.GIGOT: Mary, I looked at the speech in the Associated Press, and you know what the headline was? ""Donald Trump threatens to sue his women accusers.""(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: It had nothing to do with the ideas he was laying out for change.MARY ANASTASIA O'GRADY, COLUMNIST: Right. It's really mindboggling why he would put that in the speech when he knows that's what the press is going to lead with on the headline one he said it. As Dan said, there was a lot of good ideas in there. And you know, this country does not want to vote for Hillary Clinton.GIGOT: The majority clearly don't according to polls.O'GRADY: They are asking him to give them a reason. It was another lost opportunity, I think, because he talked about energy, and you know, he talked about Obamacare. Those are all important. But he put too much emphasis on protectionism. He talked about 4 percent growth. You are not going to get it if you tear up NAFTA and call China a currency manipulator and damage our trade relationships.Bill, in some ways, a microcosm -- the speech a microcosm of the campaign.  It took 17 minutes to get to the substance.BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST: Right. The policies, as Dan says, are fine. But he has two problems, especially with bringing up the women that he will sue them. One is the Chris Christie problem. I don't know if Chris Christie knew about the bridge closers beforehand. But the behavior of his age sounds like him. That is why it's getting traction. I don't know if Donald Trump groped these women, but it sounds like he based on the tape.  He has that problem. And talking about suing them, if he had a moment like Hillary Clinton had today, she says, I know there are some of you that have questions about me, and I want to earn your vote. We can say it's insincere, but she did it better than Trump today.GIGOT: Kim, let's turn to the substance. I want to get the ideas that he put on the table here. I mean, you know, you follow energy for us, and he is really talking about an enormous amount of opening up of energy, developing in the United States, big tax cut, a really big economic program, if he can get in the White House and implement it.KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST: Yeah. To be clear, it's important to note, there was nothing new here. It's pretty much, every idea that Donald Trump put in the speech, is something that the campaign covered before.  The idea was that there's a sense of urgency to it and that he is going to indeed be the change agent that gets it done.But, yes, he had a bold economic plan in terms of energy and exports, dramatic tax reform, a regulatory proposal that he would get rid of two regulations for anyone that was proposed, for instance. He had a big ethics part of it, which was about new restrictions on lobbyists, a new proposal for constitutional amendment for term limits. This is talking to people who feel there's gridlock and problems and favoritism in Washington.  School choice, which feeds into some of the things he talked about in cities. This is about a bold agenda. But, you know, can you get through the noise? I don't know.GIGOT: Well, here, if I were recommending the campaign how to behave, I would take the latter part of the speech and give it every day between now and the election. Just tell people, this is the change I represent and this is what I will do for you and get out of the noise. Even --(CROSSTALK)STRASSEL: Stop talking about the women.GIGOT: He talked --STRASSEL: I mean --GIGOT: Mary, he raised the point. He said, we have to get through the noise of the campaign. But he introduced the noise.O'GRADY: What you are seeing there is his personality. That is just Donald J. Trump coming through. You know, he made the joke -- sort of the joke the other night at the Al Smith Dinner that you know, when I used to be a Democrat. And the fact of the matter is that is not that long ago.  And I think a lot of the ideas are not really deeply embedded in him. He is shallow on a lot of the stuff. When he goes to talk, he reverts to the sound bites.MCGURN: The problem that he has, though, to win, is not his policies. He has plenty of policies, as Kim said. They are not new. He scored well when he went after Mr. Clinton on the policies. The problem is a lot of people think he is a nut. That he is not stable. And that's what he has not done. When he brings up the women again, and I'm going to -- I'm a billionaire, I'm going sue you, it does not help the case.GIGOT: And of course, Hillary Clinton's case has to disqualify him personally.MCGURN: Right.GIGOT: She has gone after his ideas, except in a token fashion.What about Hillary Clinton at the end of the race? She is entering, going in to Arizona and going in to Indiana and going in to Missouri and hiring people in Utah to be able to take some of the red states away from Trump.  Trump has to change the national numbers. Otherwise, he could get swamped in a lot of the red states.HENNINGER: Good point, because she has more resources than he has. He does not have as many resources as McCain or Romney had. She has field workers in those states that are going out to work.One point missing was integrating it with the Republican Party. He is relying on the Republican infrastructure in those states. If he could get them behind the ideas, he might have a chance.GIGOT: All right, Dan.Thank you all.Still ahead, new accusations of Pay-to-Play at the Clinton Foundation as new WikiLeaks reveal a $12 million deal with the king of Morocco.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Now from WikiLeaks we learned that she tried to get $12 million from the king of Morocco for an appearance, one appearance. More pay for play.(END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT: Donald Trump, Friday, accusing Hillary Clinton of engaging in Pay- to-Play, for agreeing to speak at a 2015 Clinton Global Initiative summit in Morocco, in exchange for a $12 million pledge to the foundation from the country's king. It was a speech she ultimate did not deliver, but it caused headaches in the run-up to her presidential campaign, with close aide, Huma Abedin, telling advisers, John Podesta and Robby Mook, in early 2015, quote, ""She created this mess and she knows it,"" end quotes.So, Kim, take us through this Moroccan deal. Why should we be concerned?KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST: Yeah, that e-mail that you saw flashed up there, that is Huma Abedin talking to advisers whether or not Hillary Clinton can pull out of this. The campaign, at this point, very concerned about all the headlines about the foundation. And yet, we find out that that donation from the king of Morocco was contingent upon her appearance.  What we have here is yet more evidence that the Clintons were selling themselves or access to themselves in return for donations. This plays in to a bigger theme of special benefits that were given to Clinton donors and it's very concerning. Look, the question is, would she do it as president?GIGOT: I want to play an exchange at the debate between Moderator Chris Wallace, and Hillary Clinton on the foundation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS WALLACE, DEBATE MODERATOR: Secretary Clinton, during your 2009 Senate confirmation hearing, you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the Clinton Foundation while you were secretary of state. But e-mails show that donors got special access to you. Can you really say that you kept your pledge to that Senate committee? And why isn't what happened and what went on between you and the Clinton Foundation, why isn't it what Mr. Trump called Pay-to-Play?HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, everything I did, as secretary of state, was in furtherance of our country's interest and our values. The State Department has said that. I think that's been proven.  But I'm happy, in fact, I am thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation, because it is a world renowned charity.(END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT: We should stipulate what the Moroccan exchange referred to was after she had left the State Department.HENNINGER: Yeah.GIGOT: Of course, still running for president. But that was one big duck of a question, Dan.HENNINGER: It was, unless she believes it, which is to say, the Clintons think that their personal interest absolutely conforms to public interest.  They see no separation whatsoever. Well, this harkens back to Tammany Hall. Remember George W. Plunkett, ""I see my opportunities and I took them?""GIGOT: Right.HENNINGER: That was known as ""honest graft,"" meaning, whatever is going on in public, we get a piece of the action. And that's essentially what's been going on.GIGOT: Great phrase, ""honest graft,"" Bill.MCGURN: Right.(LAUGHTER)This is not a foundation that had a conflict of interest. This is a conflict of interest on which they built the foundation.(LAUGHTER)Work with the State Department and that is how they monitor it.GIGOT: I know being a lobbying firm --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: Doug Band, who was with the foundation.MCGURN: I believe even Doug Band complained that a former President Clinton did not have to sign any kind of conflict-of-interest agreement.GIGOT: Mary, I was also struck with the trade agreement. Secretary Clinton at the debate said, I read the draft, and then I said I'm against it. We know from WikiLeaks that, of course, she had decided to oppose it before she had a chance to read any draft.O'GRADY: Yeah, of course. The beauty of these WikiLeaks and FBI documents that were released --GIGOT: Though they are from Russia, we should say, apparently, via Russia.(CROSSTALK)O'GRADY: We are seeing --GIGOT: -- violations of privacy.O'GRADY: Of course. But we are seeing this double standard, the double talk that Mrs. Clinton and her advisers had among themselves and then saying something entirely different to the public.In that tape you played, she went on to say that she was so proud of what she did with Haiti, with this Clinton Foundation. And of course, at Donald Trump very accurately said, the Haitians really dislike the Clintons at this point. They feel that they came down there and they used the earthquake as a way to do favors for their friends.GIGOT: Kim, I want to raise the issue of General James Cartwright, the general who has agreed to a guilty plea this week for lying to the FBI for having talked to two reporters about a top-secret U.S. operation. A lot of people, including Donald Trump, are raising questions about it being a double standard with Hillary Clinton and her handling of the e-mails. How do you see that?STRASSEL: Of course, it's a double standard. This investigation into him is the way the FBI investigates people in situations like that. They went after him on a national security charge and, in the end, they got him on lying. You go back and look at the FBI interview notes, with the Clinton team, and you have several instances of Clinton aids saying things that seem out-right false and contradicting things in the record. If the FBI had wanted to go after them on a lying, perjury charge, they could have done it easily. Instead, they chose to close their eyes to the entire thing. She was treated her with kid's gloves and Donald Trump is showing that.MCGURN: The FBI, you would think, when you are investigating a former Senator, former first lady, former secretary of state that is a presidential candidate, they say, we are going to dot our ""I's"" and cross our ""T's"" and do everything by the book. The difference is nothing was by the book with Hillary Clinton, and it was with the general. One of the interesting things will be if Congress puts these FBI agents on the stand, under oath, to talk about the investigation.And one of the things that we don't know is all of the Department of Justice lawyers that made these deals, they are the ones that decide to not go to a grand jury, that make the deals that allow Cheryl Mills to be the lawyer. And we don't know even who they are.GIGOT: And this issue could dog her presidency if she is elected president, Bill. No question.When we come back, Paul Ryan hits the road. The speaker is on a 17-state tour as he scrambles to shore up the Republican House majority. Our own Joe Rago joins him this week. And he'll join us, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT: Turning now to the battle of control for the House of Representatives, and Paul Ryan's fight to save the Republican majority.  Since his public fallout with Donald Trump two weeks ago, the House speaker has embarked on a cross-country tour to shore up vulnerable members, visiting 17 states and 45 cities in the closing weeks of the campaign.Wall Street Journal editorial board member, Joe Rago, was on the road with Ryan this week in Florida.So, Joe, let's set the stage here. There's 435 members of the House.  Republicans have a majority of the -- that can afford to lose 29. If they lose 30, they lose control. How many seats are competitive?JOE RAGO, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: There's 57 seats that are maybe somewhat competitive. But it's really a core of about 40 seats. If Democrats take 30 of them, they run the table, they would flip the House.GIGOT: Where are the seats? What kind of seats are they?RAGO: They're primarily suburban, so think of countries around Philadelphia, Denver suburbs. They tend to be middle class, moderate, decided by a couple of percentage points. College educated --GIGOT: College educated Republican voters are the ones that the Republican candidate needs to get in the seats.RAGO: Right. And these are the districts where Donald Trump is having the problem winning over that block, college educated whites.GIGOT: If you look at the Republican seats, I think what I hear is one- third of the seats are pro Trump, another third maybe more anti-Trump, the majority of the district and then somewhere in between. That's a hard field to navigate for the Republicans.RAGO: It is, and Paul Ryan is in a vice here. He has all the competing constituents and trying to hold it all together.GIGOT: What is his strategy for doing that?RAGO: Well. So he is going on a barnstorming tour. He is trying to get a lot of local news coverage for these candidates, positive coverage. I was down with him in Miami, with Carlos Cabello. They toured an English- language learning school --GIGOT: Cabello has made education a real priority.RAGO: Education and anti-poverty. Ryan is also trying to promote a better way. This is his solutions-oriented agenda for 2017. He's saying to voters, here is what we want to do in Congress. Here is what we want to do on healthcare, on the economy, on national security. Hold us accountable for that. Here are specific ideas.GIGOT: And this is the whole Congress has agreed to it, left, right, and center, the whole Republican House.RAGO: Yes. It's remarkable. The consensus that was performed came from the bottom up, organized organically. Everybody has their own piece. They are really running on the positive ideas.GIGOT: Are these ideas breaking through in the districts, because with the presidential campaign sucking up so much of the media attention, can they break through with specific ideas like this?RAGO: It gives them something to talk about that is not Donald Trump.  It's not broken through nationally.GIGOT: That is not important for the House, necessarily.RAGO: What is important is, when Paul Ryan goes to the district and gets on the evening news with the congressmen, talking about, education, criminal justice reform, all the things. I think they might be having more tangible results down-ballot in the districts.GIGOT: When the Democrats took the House in 2006, they ran against the Iraq war and against corruption. What are they running against now?RAGO: They are running against Donald Trump. They're trying to tie Republicans to his medicine ball. But the interesting contrast --GIGOT: In some of these districts, he isn't popular.RAGO: He is unpopular. The interesting contrast from 2006 is Rahm Emanuel and Chuck Schumer picked moderate Democrats who set their districts.  That's what Republicans are running this year. These are good fits for the districts. The Democrats are really Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.  They don't have as much appeal in these districts outside the Denver.GIGOT: That is potentially a big for Republicans who want to try to dominate the middle of the political debate.RAGO: Yeah. These are districts that make the majority. They are doing the best job they can.GIGOT: What is your best estimate of how many seats Republicans lose?RAGO: I'm going with 15 maybe.GIGOT: 15?RAGO: If it's a big wash out for Donald Trump, it's increasingly possible that the House could slip. But I don't think it is likely.GIGOT: Thank you, Joe.Still ahead, it's a central issue in the 2016 race. What did we learn in this week's debate about the candidates and the Supreme Court?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: The Supreme Court should represent all of us. That is how I see the court. And the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.TRUMP: The justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life. They will have a conservative bent. They will be protecting the Second Amendment.  They are great scholars in all cases and they are people of tremendous respect. They will interpret the Constitution the way that the founders wanted it interpreted. And I believe that is very, very important.(END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT: That was Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump at the debate this week on what they are looking for in a Supreme Court justice. It's one of the most consequential issues in the 2016 race with the next president likely to shape the nation's highest court the most a generation.We're back with Dan Henninger, Mary Anastasia O'Grady, Bill McGurn and Kim Strassel.So, Bill, try to put in to perspective the difference between the two as you see it?BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST: Well it's the difference between Democrats and Republicans, especially conservative Republicans.GIGOT: On legal issues.MCGURN: On legal issues. Well, on the court. We want judges that -- our primary goal is not the outcome, it's what the law says to interpret the law. The left, they don't care. They just want the outcome. Donald Trump sort of got to this on abortion when he said he wanted pro-life -- that is not quite what we want. So the left --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: Right. You don't want let --(CROSSTALK)MCGURN: You don't want the Supreme Court legislating that. However, he corrected himself by saying, probably if he got the judges he wanted, it would go back to the states where it belongs. So the left --GIGOT: Abortion law, the abortion law would return to the states.MCGURN: Abortion law. I think that is it. I mean, the left has a lot easier time. They are just worried about outcome. Mrs. Clinton put a few litmus tests there. I think under a Clinton presidency, the difference is she'd see the court as one arm of getting what she wants, especially stuff that couldn't get through Congress, and the administrative state as the other.GIGOT: Mary, I want to ask you about the Second Amendment. Donald Trump mentioned it explicitly. Chris Wallace asked him, and it was a fascinating question, the Heller case, the landmark case which said the Second Amendment, you have an individual right to bear arms, not just militia.  The law did allow -- the case did allow for some regulation of, but not a total ban. And she kind of said, I'm for the Second Amendment but I'm against Heller.(LAUGHTER)You can't be both.MARY ANASTASIA O'GRADY, COLUMNIST: You can't square that. And you know, it's been a long-time objective of the Democrats to basically overturn Heller. And I think when she is looking for people in the court, she wants people who don't believe that Americans have that fundamental right to bear arms. That is a major issue in this campaign.GIGOT: Kim, did it have anything to do with toddlers, the D.C.-v-Heller case --(LAUGHTER)-- as secretary Clinton said, toddlers --KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST: No!GIGOT: -- keeping guns out of toddlers' hands?STRASSEL: No, it was a complete canard. I heard someone say, it was like saying ""Fatal Attraction"" was about a woman that didn't like bunny rabbits.(LAUGHTER)It is really not what the case was about. The case was about whether there is an individual right to bear arms as written in the Constitution.  Toddlers had nothing to do with it.(LAUGHTER)She was trying to distract from the fact that she is on record in the past saying that she thought the court decided that case wrong. If she believes that it means she does not believe there's an individual right to bear arms and she doesn't want it to be an issue in the campaign because there's lot of people that vote on the issue.GIGOT: And it was a 5-4, Dan, because that decision did allow for a reasonable regulation -- it was by Justice Scalia -- of guns, you could see a liberal court carve out and make that a hollow shell of a right by approval restriction after restriction after restriction.HENNINGER: No. And then that raises the issue of what kind of justices either one of them would appoint into that contract. And Donald Trump, in his speech at Gettysburg, announced -- I take him at his word -- that Justice Scalia's widow has, this weekend, planted an ""Elect Trump"" sign in her front yard in northern Virginia. So at this point in time, we may assume that Donald Trump will appoint another Justice Scalia.Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton will undoubtedly appoint justices to the left of Sonia Sotomayor. This idea of standing up --GIGOT: To the left of Sonia Sotomayor?(LAUGHTER)HENNINGER: Absolutely.GIGOT: There's not a lot of space there.HENNINGER: She'll find it.(LAUGHTER)GIGOT: What about the First Amendment?Kim, let me go back to you on the First Amendment.Citizens United, you have written a book about the Democratic attempts of restricting free speech. She said she wants to appoint justices, as a litmus test, basically, to overturn Citizens United, which allowed corporations and unions to contribute to political groups. What do you make of her promise to appoint justices that overturn that?STRASSEL: Yeah, she has not only said she'd appoint justices -- and she has already been actively encouraging someone to bring a test case up so that Citizens can be overturned -- she is running on a constitutional amendment to the U.S. Constitution to get rid of Citizens United, which is another way of saying, putting government in charge of who can spend money and therefore speak in elections. It's a big threat to the country. It's clear, she and Bernie Sanders, both, that they would use that to make sure their opponents were barred from taking part in politics.GIGOT: Quickly, Mary, 20 judges that Donald Trump has said are on his list to appoint. There's some people on the right who say, you know what, they don't know if they can trust him to do that, because he has come to the issue late.O'GRADY: Well, I think most of the electorate will say there's more of a chance with Donald Trump and none with Hillary Clinton. So if you're voting on the court, I think you have to take that chance.GIGOT: And if you have a Republican Senate, they would be able to steer -- oppose anybody they didn't like, a nominee.All right, still ahead, Russian President Vladimir Putin taking center stage in the 2016 race. What is he up to, and how should the next president respond? We will ask Paul Wolfowitz, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: From everything that I see, has no respect for this person.CLINTON: Well, that's because he would rather have a puppet as president of the United States.TRUMP: No puppet. No puppet.CLINTON: And it's pretty clearly --TRUMP: You're the puppet.CLINTON: It's pretty clear you won't admit --TRUMP: No, you --CLINTON: -- the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do.(END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT: Russian President Vladimir Putin playing a central role in the 2016 presidential campaign as America's relationship with Moscow continues to deteriorate. And amid Russia's air war in Syria and suspected hacking of the U.S. election, comes yet another provocation. Earlier, this month, the Kremlin deployed nuclear-capable missiles to Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave bordering Poland and Lithuania.Paul Wolfowitz was the deputy secretary of defense under President George W. Bush. He is now a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.Thanks a lot for coming in, Paul.PAUL WOLFOWITZ, VISITING SCHOLAR, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE & FORMER DEPUTY DEFENSE SECRETARY: Good to be with you.GIGOT: You followed Russia and Vladimir Putin for some time. What do you think he is trying to accomplish with this provocations in the Middle East, Eastern Europe and now in cyber space?WOLFOWITZ: I think there are two things to important to understand about this man who sort of aspires to be the new czar of Russia. Number one, his domestic position depends on his ability to flex his muscle.GIGOT: OK.WOLFOWITZ: He became president by butchering the Chechnyans and then won re-election partly by invading Georgia. I think his operation in Ukraine is also part of securing his domestic base, which is not all that secure because Russia's economy is in trouble.I think the second thing is --(CROSSTALK)WOLFOWITZ: Sorry, go on.GIGOT: Go ahead, Paul. Finish your point.WOLFOWITZ: I think the second thing is, someone used to say about the old Soviet Union, he is like a burglar going down a hall way, testing which doors are locked and going into ones that aren't. I think we have given him way too many opportunities to go through open doors.GIGOT:  So, basically, responding to weakness. He will grab whatever opportunities he can, as he tries to expand in a greater Russia, and reassert Russian influence on his border, east and west and in the Middle East.WOLFOWITZ: He also wants to win re-election and remain president of Russia through 2024, which would put him at the age of 72.(LAUGHTER)Pretty ambitious.GIGOT: So, take this issue of hacking of e-mails, which our intelligence community says they believe was taken at the highest levels of Russia, which means Vladimir Putin. And we have not responded yet, although Joe Biden had said we will. Do you think the United States has to respond to that at some, in some way?WOLFOWITZ: I think we have to. I think it's very important. In fact, it's important not just with respect to Russian behavior, but in general, if -- if bad actors, whether they are states or individuals or groups, believe that they can attack us in this flagrant way without suffering any consequences, then we will get more of it. I don't know what we will do in response. We may never know if we have adequately responded, but the people who are doing it need to know they have paid a price, a serious price.GIGOT: To your point there, the people who did it need to know they are paying a price, but if we are trying to send a message around the world, don't do it, the world needs to know we responded in some important way, no?WOLFOWITZ: You are right. Yes, they do. And one way or another, they need to learn.GIGOT: Would you go so far as to suggest, as some have, including James Degredus (ph), who is a formal admiral, suggesting that what we need to do is perhaps consider hacks ourselves, going on offense, and releasing some of the secrets of these Kremlin operators, people who maybe they have foreign bank accounts, for example, or maybe they have e-mails of their own that are embarrassing. Would you go so far as to suggest that as an option?WOLFOWITZ: I think their bank accounts are one of the Achilles heels of their regime. Yes, I do think if we have information about them, especially how money has been stolen from the Russian people, it's important to get it out. That is important to get it out. They deserve it.GIGOT: That's interesting.OK, we will have another president, one or the other, Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. What is your advice to the new president about how to -- how to address Putin? Do we need a -- really a new policy towards it, and what should it be?WOLFOWITZ: Look, I think, you have to start by recognizing that the old policy that they are inheriting is a bad one.GIGOT: Right.WOLFOWITZ: That we have been going down the wrong course, providing opportunities when we should have been closing them off. I think you also have to recognize that you cannot reverse course overnight. It would be like trying to throw a car in reverse, when it's going too fast down the highway.You need to pick your targets and you need to act in a way at the beginning that convinces other people that have to be with you that, in fact, you are serious. So, I think, no question going after the cyberattacks would be one way of showing seriousness. But I think it's important also to show seriousness against the kind of aggression that the Russians have been conducting, whether it's in Syria or Ukraine or, as you pointed out, the deployment of the border of two NATO allies, on the border of Lithuania and Poland.GIGOT: But that means sending a message to the Europeans, for example, that we are going lead so that we don't want them to weaken sanctions. We want to strengthen sanctions. I assume that's got to be on the table.WOLFOWITZ: Yeah, I'm not sure that sanctions make a big difference. But if there's sanctions that can be painful, especially for the plutocrats that run the regime, that would be a good thing. If there are things that we can do by the way of a more positive kind to bolster Ukraine and the Ukraine economy and bolster Ukraine diplomatically, which I believe has finally started to happen a little bit in the Council of Europe, that would be a very important piece of this also. So that Russia doesn't -- I think one of Putin's objectives in the Ukraine is to make sure the country fails.  It's a bad example for his own people. It's a country that got rid of a dictator and then people went through his mansion and discovered how he was stealing from them. That is not something that Putin wants his people to see in Russia.GIGOT: All right.WOLFOWITZ: But I also think an important place to start, frankly, would be in Syria where there's both a humanitarian emergency that the Russians are causing and a strategic disaster that they are causing as well.GIGOT: Thank you, Paul Wolfowitz, for coming in. Appreciate it. Thank you for being here.When we come back, as the battle for control of the Senate goes down to the wire, a look at one of the races that could make or break Democratic hopes of a takeover                               .(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT: Turning to the battle for the Senate and a race that could determine which party is in control next year. In Indiana, former Democratic Senate Evan Bayh and Republican Congressman Todd Young are in a tight race to replace retiring GOP Senator Dan Coates. As the polls have narrowed this fall, the ad wars have heated up. Take a look at the latest exchange.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANNOUNCER: After the economy crashed, Indiana families were struggling.  We turned to the Senator Evan Bayh to protect us from the Washington insiders and Wall Street bankers who got us into that mess. But instead of going to work for us, Evan Bayh went to work for them, making millions as a big-money influence peddler and cashed in with the big banks.SEN. EVAN BAYH, D-IND.: My opponent is attacking me as a lobbyist.  That is a lie. But here is what is true. I've cut taxes. I've helped save 100,000 Indiana auto jobs. I fought for welfare reform, pushed for a balanced budget. I've taken on the extremes of both parties, and I always will to get things done.(END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT: Wall Street Journal editorial writer, Alicia Finley, is just back from Indiana where she's been following the race.Alicia, so Chuck Schumer who wants to be majority leader of the Democrats in the Senate, picked Evan Bayh, who is out of the Senate for six years, thinking this is going to be an easy one. Lots of money in his bank account. Well-known name in Indiana. Hasn't turned out that way. Why?ALICIA FINLEY, EDITORIAL WRITER: Right. So Evan Bayh is the former two- term governor as well as a former two-term Senator. He retired in 2011 soon after voting for Obamacare, and it was likely it couldn't have won re- election.GIGOT: You think he --(CROSSTALK)FINLEY: I think he likely would have lost. A lot of the Democratic incumbents who were the, quote, unquote, ""60th vote,"" 60th votes deciding - - 60th votes for Obamacare also had trouble with standing re-election.GIGOT: But they figured six years later, people forget, the Bayh name is so prominent in Indiana, but Republicans are spending time trying to remind Indiana voters of those votes.FINLEY: Right. It's not just the vote. He's running more against his -- challenges aren't so much Todd Young, the Republican opponent, as his voting record. But it's not just what he did in office. it's all the money he's made since leaving office. You had a lot of stories come out that he's basically in the band in Indiana. He's maintained a small condo in Indianapolis, valued at $53,000, which is about the amount he's paid in property tax on his place in Florida.(LAUGHTER)FINELY: He has multimillion dollar houses in Washington and hasn't spent much time in Indiana. He's basically gone to Washington and lobbied for these big companies that he wants regulated.GIGOT: And he responded to that in that ad.The other thing that struck me about that ad is he's running as a conservative in some respects.FINLEY: Right.GIGOT: Saying I cut taxes, I look out for Indiana interest, nothing on his votes on health care and other things that were the Obama agenda in 2009 and '10.FINLEY: That's right. He's running as a fiscal conservative, Hoosier values. Indiana is a more fiscal year, and more conservative state. You see that in the fact that Trump is leading Hillary there.(CROSSTALK)FINLEY: Which is interesting. This is the one state where you don't have the Hillary surrogates coming out and campaigning for a Senate candidate.GIGOT: They're staying out.FINLEY: They're staying out. You have not seen Tim Kaine or Hillary or Bill. This is the only state that's happened.GIGOT: What is Bayh's answer, explanation for his Obamacare vote? Is he defending it or running away from it?FINLEY: He's not. He's running away from it and he's deflecting it very capably. He said, well, Todd Young wants to send us back to the days when women can get charged more for their health care just because they're women. He wants to allow health insurers not to provide coverage just because you have a pre-existing condition.GIGOT: He's not defending the vote but he's defending some of the results of the good things about Obamacare it seems, focusing on those --(CROSSTALK)FINLEY: That's right. We need to maintain these good parts and improve upon the law.GIGOT: What is Young running on?FINLEY: He's -- Young is running on the, we need to bring a more -- I wouldn't say pro-business, but we need to reign in the bureaucracy. One of his big talking points is the Clean Water Act --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: Regulation.FINLEY: Regulation. I visited a farm down there where the cleaning water rule, which allows the EPA to regulate everything as small as a puddle, is a big onus, and farmers are complaining about that. And he's one supporter of the farmers.GIGOT: All right.Let me go back to Dan.On Indiana, Donald Trump is leading but not by as much as a Republican normally would.HENNINGER: The Real Clear Politics average has him up by five points.  Evan Bayh is up by five points. Mitt Romney carried the state by 11 points and George W. Bush, first, by 15 and then 20. I think Trump should be a lot further ahead than he is if he's going to pull Todd Young across the finish line.GIGOT: What's your call on that?FINLEY: That's exactly right. Trump needs to pull to Todd Young over the finish line and he needs over the working class votes and that is why Bayh's hitting the trade issues really hard.GIGOT: Really hard.Do you think Young can pull it out?FINLEY: I think he could, yes.GIGOT: All right. Thank you, Alicia.We have to take one more break. When we come back, ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT: Time now for ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.Kim, start us off.STRASSEL: So this is a huge miss for the media for its complete lack of professional standards. There is a new report out from the Center for Public Integrity saying in this election cycle members of the media, including reporters and editors, have given almost $400,000 to the Clinton and Trump campaigns, 96 percent of it to Hillary Clinton. Most people in America understand that the media is in the tank for Democrats but we have got to a point where they're openly broadcasting it. And they deserve all the criticism they're getting for being in the tank.GIGOT: All right, Kim, thanks.Bill?MCGURN: This is a miss to President Obama who seems to be in search of the metaphor for the Affordable Aare Act and why it's so unaffordable. It's a starter home. Now he's got this backward. When you get a starter home, you fix it up and a few years into it you sell it and move up. Under Obamacare, your home loses it kitchen --(LAUGHTER)-- and then they tell you, by the way, your mortgage is doubled.(LAUGHTER)Bill Clinton said more for less. Not a good analogy.GIGOT: All right.Mary?O'GRADY: A hit for Senator Richard Burr, Republican, North Carolina, who this week criticized a White House directive that instructs the U.S. director of National Intelligence to cooperate with Cuban intelligence counterparts. And Senator Burr said, I don't think as long as I'm chairman that the committee is going to be sharing intelligence, in any intelligence relationship, with Cuba. That's a good idea since their favored allies are Iran, North Korea and Russia.GIGOT: Dan?HENNINGER: A miss to our good friend the federal government. We heard last week that an NSA contractor has been arrested for amassing 500 million pages of documents from the NSA, some top military secrets.GIGOT: Wow.HENNINGER: He did this over 20 years. You know, in the movies, you've got to be Tom Cruise hanging from a ceiling on a wire to get any of this stuff.  In reality, you can be Edward Snowden putting it on a flash drive or this guy walking out of the building with the crown jewels. Who is protecting us?GIGOT: It's astonishing.Thank you, Dan.Remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us at JERonFNC.That's it for this week's show. Thanks to my panel. Thanks to all of you for watching. I'm Paul Gigot. We hope to see you right here next week.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Journal: Editorial Report,"" March 19, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.PAUL GIGOT, FOX HOST:  Welcome to this special edition of the ""Journal: Editorial Report.""  I'm Paul Gigot.And then there were three.  Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and John Kasich are the last candidates standing in a Republican field that once numbered 17.  Some big wins on Tuesday solidified Donald Trump's status as the clear front- runner, and the billionaire businessman thinks he can close the deal by the Republican convention in July.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE & CEO, TRUMP ORGANIZATION:  I do want to finish this off.  I'm dealing with two smart, tough guys, and I want to make sure I end up winning.  I'd like to get to the finish line. I'm pretty good as getting to finish lines.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT:  But opponents argue his path to the nomination is far from straight, the delegate math far from clear.  And party leaders this week said they're bracing for the possibility that the fight could go all the way to Cleveland.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  There's more likely to become an open convention than we thought before.  So we're getting our minds around the idea this could very well become a reality and, therefore, those of us involved in the convention need to respect that.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT:  Joining the panel this week, Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; Washington columnist, Kim Strassel; assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman; and former Wall Street Journal editorial board member and FOX News contributor, Steve Moore.  So, Kim, start us off by putting this race into context.  How close is Donald Trump to wrapping this up?  KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  Well, look, as we said, and he did have a good night and technically won a number of states, but by losing Ohio, which was a winner-take-all state, to John Kasich, it denied him a crucial number of delegates.  That means, going forward, Donald Trump has to get more than 50 percent of the remaining delegates out there.  That's a tough thing to do.  When you have both Ted Cruz and John Kasich saying they intend to be there to the end, just trying to deny him delegates here and there and trying to get to a contested convention, it doesn't look like he will wrap it up soon.  GIGOT:  Kim, there's no doubt in your mind that John Kasich and Ted Cruz have to start winning more primaries if they're going to head off -- go into the convention themselves with enough delegates?  STRASSEL:  Well, they have to win -- they have to do well in a lot of primaries.  Look, as we go forward again into some of these races, what you have is a systems that award delegates on a hybrid basis or a proportional basis.  What it means is there's more opportunity for them to split the vote with Donald Trump, pull away almost as many delegates as he does, if they do well.  And the math going forward is also a bit different in that we have a lot of states, for instance in the northeast and out in the west that may prove more favorable to guys like Ted Cruz in the West or John Kasich in the northeast, and that might help them, too.  OK.Steve, the thing that's fascinating about Donald Trump's support is he has a loyal base of support, 37 percent of the votes so far, in some states now creeping over 40 percent.  They're very loyal to him.  They seem impervious to criticism and negative advertising.  On the other hand, there's a real resistance to him on the part of a lot of Republican voters.  He hasn't gotten over 50 percent yet.  How does he compare in your mind to previous Republican front-runners?  STEVE MOORE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR & FORMER WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  He's what I call a political black swan event.  We haven't really seen anything like this before, Paul, so it's hard to really liken this too much of anything we've ever seen.I think the closest parallel, I would say, would be Ross Perot back in 1992.  GIGOT:  1992.MOORE:  Right.  In fact, I wrote a column this week saying, you know, if Trump does win -- and I think he's likely to.  I would like to see Cruz make a run at him.  I think he could remake the Republican Party and it will look more like a Perot reform party than the conservative party that Ronald Reagan turned the Republican Party into.  One other point.  Some of you are missing the point about who's got all the delegates.  What's really important I think to the voters is you've got a candidate who has won almost all of the big states.  He won Florida by a huge margin.  He's won Michigan, Illinois, North Carolina.  Likely to win out in Arizona.  Almost certainly will win New York.  And I think regards of whether he gets to a majority of the delegates or not, if he's winning all these big states and goes with --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  OK --MOORE:  -- but a plurality, and then they try to take the nomination away from him through these byzantine rules that nobody knows how they work, I think it could cause a civil war within the party.  GIGOT:  Dan, those rules have been in place since 1860, the fact that you have to have a majority plus one of the delegates.  That's the rule.  They've been the rules.  Lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot.  So it does happen.  It hasn't happened recently, but it has happened.  So do you agree with Steve on the issue -- the idea that a contested convention, open convention, if Trump can't get the majority in the first ballot, that it -- open convention is fair?  DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR:  I think an open convention is fair.  I agree with Steve up to a point, but we have to try to keep in mind that the election doesn't end after someone gets the nomination.  You have to run against your opponent in the other party and win that election.   What we're looking at here are three candidates, all of who have a plurality of support inside the Republican Party.  As you were suggesting earlier, we don't yet have a majority candidate.  You really would prefer a majority candidate going into a campaign against Hillary Clinton, who will have majority support at least within her own party.  GIGOT:  James, you have these -- a big chunk of voters in some of these states who are saying they won't vote for Donald Trump, I think as much as 30 percent in some of these states.  And up to 40 percent saying they might consider a third-party nominee if it's Trump versus Hillary Clinton.  JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR:  The polls are really historic in terms of how bad it is for a front runner here.  And it's not just within the party.  In a recent ""Wall Street Journal""/NBC poll recently 67 percent of Americans cannot see themselves voting for Donald Trump.  His negatives are at 64 percent, strongly negative at 54.  Most people in the country have a strongly negative view of him.  So if there's a Trump nomination, it's very hard to see.  Not impossible, might be figure out a way, but very hard to see how he becomes president.   GIGOT:  All right, we're going to continue this in the next block.Ted Cruz and John Kasich both vowing to fight on despite Donald Trump's delegate lead.  Does either candidate have a realistic path to the nomination?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. JOHN KASICH, R-OHIO, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I don't think anybody's going to have enough delegates.  I think Cruz has to get look 70 percent of the remaining delegates and we're going into where my strength is.  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KASICH:  I want you to know something.  We're going to go -- we are going to go all the way to Cleveland and secure the Republican nomination.  (CHEERING)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Every Republican has a clear choice.  Only two campaigns have a plausible path to the nomination, ours and Donald Trump's.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT:  John Kasich and Ted Cruz both claiming a path forward on Tuesday and promising to stay in the race until the Republican convention in July. Kasich racked up his first and only victory in his home state of Ohio.  And while Cruz failed to win any of the five Republican contests outright, he did add to his delegate total.  Does either candidate have a realistic shot at the nomination?  Before we get to that, Steve, I want you to talk up that question from the last block that Dan and James raised about Donald Trump's enormous negative ratings.  This is the obstacles that some Republicans feel.  He has a negative 39 percent favorable/unfavorable in the latest ""Wall Street Journal"" poll.  Comparing with Hillary Clinton at negative 13, Ted Cruz minus 18.  How does Donald Trump unite the party and then win in November with those ratings?  MOORE:  Look, I agree with some of that.  I think the biggest problem for Trump is this gender gap, which is really huge, and a lot of Republican women are saying they won't vote for Trump.  I think if Trump runs as a general election candidate, I think he actually reshuffles the deck of how politics normally works.  I do think he would lose maybe 20 percent to 25 percent of Republican voters, but he's going to win millions of Independent voters, and I think a lot of Democratic voters. Remember Hillary is not popular among Democratic voters.  I think Trump would have a good chance of working-class Americans coming over to the Republican Party.  This is sort of the argument, Paul that I've made about -- look, I love Ted Cruz and I've worked for John Kasich.  I'm only making the point that the fact that he is attracting so many millions of new voters into the party is a good thing.  And I shudder when I hear people say, well, they're not really conservatives and so on.  I thought Republicans wanted these voters in the party.  GIGOT:  All right, James, let's talk about Ted Cruz.  He says he's the only one who can really compete.  Can he -- can he do this?  FREEMAN:  He can, and he is the only one.  That's just a mathematical fact.   It's either going to be Trump or Cruz --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  Even before the convention?  FREEMAN:  Before or after, any time unless the Republican Party wants to blow up its rules and probably alienate Trump voters.  It's either Trump or Cruz.  This is why I've been arguing Kasich should get out of the race.  I think you want particularly that one-on-one matchup, because we're going to learn about the new Republican Party.  One, you've got Cruz ahead of Trump by double digits nationwide in head-to-head polling.  But also, even if you don't believe he would beat him one on one, you find out how many Republicans would vote for Trump, when it's a contest between the two.  You find out where the ceiling in his support is.  You learn a lot about can he be a candidate?  Should there be a third party for those interested in that.  I don't think they should.  GIGOT:  Here's the problem with Cruz, though.  He's been telling a lot of Republicans for months, I can only do this with conservatives.  I don't need you moderates.  He's doing very poorly, much worse than Trump, among self-described moderate voters, self-described somewhat conservative, and he's not getting the vote so far of Republicans in metropolitan areas.  HENNINGER:  That's the point.  There were some things last Tuesday that I think are troubling to me, at least, in terms of James' argument for Cruz, which is that around Chicago and Cook County -- these are big urban states, Illinois and Ohio.  He did poorly around Cook County in Chicago.  But in Ohio, he did very poorly around Cleveland, Toledo, Columbus, and especially in Cincinnati.  He was down around 10 percent or 11 percent.  Trump tripled his numbers in all of those places.  If you're going into big urban areas like Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New York City, Nassau County, I'm hard put to see how Cruz is going to compete against Donald Trump --(CROSSTALK)  GIGOT:  This is where a lot of the primaries are, in the northeastern and Midwestern states.  FREEMAN:  Why didn't Kasich do better in Michigan or Illinois?  Why has he gotten crushed everywhere, except in the home state?  (CROSSTALK)FREEMAN:  Ted Cruz is not a perfect candidate.(CROSSTALK)  GIGOT:  Nobody is a perfect candidate.  We can stipulate that.  FREEMAN:  But mathematically, unlike Kasich, he can win.  And if your view is to deny delegates to Donald Trump so there can be a fight at the convention --GIGOT:  The question is, if your view is to deny delegates to Donald Trump so that there can be a fight at the convention, you're --(CROSSTALK)FREEMAN:  That's not my view.  My view, if they blow up the rules, they will alienate Trump voters, which is a huge mistake.  You have to bring those people into the tent.  (CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  Kim, respond to James and --(CROSSTALK)FREEMAN:  Look, it's the current rules of the Republican Party --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  What does John Kasich have to do to show he can compete?  STRASSEL:  The fatal flaw in James' argument is he says it's mathematically possible.  In fact, Ted Cruz would have to get about 70 percent of the remaining delegates.  How you do that?  How do you do that when, as you point out, Paul, he cannot seem to attract more than 20 percent or 30 percent of the most diehard conservatives?  That is a stretch.  I think what John Kasich's argument is, now that Marco Rubio is out of the race, it's likely many of Rubio's voters go to him.  They liked the similar optimistic, sunny candidate.  He will go into the proportional and hybrid states, play in particular districts where, as you said, those kind of voters, the more moderate, less conservative, modern, suburbanite, white collar, educated voters are, and claim to be their champion, and try to come out with an amount of delegates going forward as Cruz and Trump, and deny Trump the vote.(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  We've got to go, I'm afraid.  Sorry.  MOORE:  He hasn't done wet with those voters.  GIGOT:  When we come back, he continues to run strong with working-class voters, a block that could serve him well in some upcoming primaries, not to mention a general election matchup with Hillary Clinton.  What's behind Donald Trump's blue collar appeal?  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT:  Donald Trump's victories Tuesday showed, once again, his strength with blue collar voters, a group that could play a key role in some upcoming GOP primaries, not to mention a general election matchup with Hillary Clinton.John Brabender is a Republican political strategist.  He was a top adviser to former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum.  John, welcome back to the program.  JOHN BRABENDER, REPUBLICAN POLITICAL STRATEGIST:  Happy to be here.  GIGOT:  Donald Trump voters, who are they?  And why are they so attracted to Donald Trump?  BRABENDER:  Well, it's interesting.  It's taken me time and I think a lot of people time to understand the whole idea of Donald Trump is really less about Donald Trump and more about his supporters.  They have a tendency to feel very angry, disenfranchised, and very few people know much about their lives from an economic standpoint.  They're very displeased with Washington and they're tired of America getting sand kicked in their face, is their perception, and Donald Trump has rallied them to give them a voice, a megaphone, if you will, to be heard.  GIGOT:  John, is this nationalism, make America great again, that's part of the deal, or is it their economic circumstances, where they feel economically pressured, that they're -- that they're looking for somebody to improve the economy?  Which is it?  Or is it a little bit of both?  BRABENDER:  I think it's multiple things.  First and foremost, they feel like both parties have let them down, left them on the economic playing field or battleground, if you will, and they don't see anybody in either party that resonated with them to give them a voice.  Second of all, they're tired of Washington, and feel like they're not paying attention to them.  But third is, you know, it was interesting, I remember this in the Bush campaign in 2004.  They were monitoring something, where they were asking Americans, are you proud to be American?  GIGOT:  Right.  Right.BRABENDER:  They were seeing a big trend line over many years where many people said no.  I think that trend line has been become worse.  These are people who are tired of not being proud of their country.  GIGOT:  That's the nationalistic, patriotic sentiment that --(CROSSTALK)BRABENDER:  Populism, absolutely.  GIGOT:  Now you, working with Rick Santorum, targeted those voters.  You saw some of this in 2012.  You got some of them, but you couldn't persuade enough of the other Republicans to come along, moderates, not-ideological conservatives necessarily.  What is the difference this time that has allowed Trump to get a bigger coalition than Santorum or Mike Huckabee before him?  BRABENDER:  Well, I think there's probably three big differences.  First of all, is that Donald Trump has a much, much bigger megaphone than Rick Santorum had.  Second of all he's had more money than Rick Santorum.  And third of all, I think this is the biggest point, they're angrier than they were in 2012.  So I think he's tapped into that and galvanized them.  GIGOT:  Trump says he's bringing in millions of new voters.  He's going to appeal to Independents and Democrats.  I've seen a lot of polling that suggested these voters aren't really all that -- there aren't that many Democrats.  These are Republicans who haven't voted before, or if they have voted before, you know, they've been kind of sullen, maybe haven't voted in primaries before.  Which is it?  BRABENDER:  Again, I think it's both.  We saw last time, in 2012, particularly in states like Ohio, where a number of conservatives stayed home, because they could just not relate to Mitt Romney and didn't feel he was their candidate.  However, we're also seeing things like in Pennsylvania this year where there were any registration numbers than came out that showed something like 40,000-some Democrats actually switched over to Republican.  A lot of people believe this is the vote for Donald Trump.   I think the most interesting part is there was no organized effort.  That was totally organic and that's something that's very important about the fall election.  GIGOT:  Does the higher Republican turnout in primaries this year, up from 2008, where the Democrats are somewhat down, does that tell you anything about the fall election, or could that just be a primary phenomenon?  BRABENDER:  No, I think it does, Paul.  I think it tell us two things.  One, it's increased participation by people who haven't been as strong as Republicans.  These are not litmus test Republicans.  These are people who have sat on the sidelines.  Second of all, I think that will be very positive for Republicans all up and down the ballot, frankly, in November if they come along, if they're engaged.  That's why I think how this plays out with a contested convention, all these types of things, they could go back to being off the playing field if we're not careful.  GIGOT:  But the issue also is you still have this resistance in the Republican Party to Trump.  You see it in his negative ratings, in some of the support that still exists for his competitors.  How can he unify the Republican Party with so much traditional Republican resistance?  BRABENDER:  I think that's a fair question.  I think many in the party are going through basically the five stages of grief and they're still in the denial stage.  They never thought that this would truly happen.  I also think there's blame on the Trump campaign, quite frankly.  I think there are things they can do to add more gravitas, add more vision, put a few more people on the stage with him, not just always about Donald Trump, to show some of this unity.  I think he has to do that in both rhetoric and actions, as well as to become more of a visionary candidate, rather than just an argumentative candidate.  GIGOT:  OK.  We'll see if he's up to that.John Brabender, thank you for being with us.  BRABENDER:  Thank you.  GIGOT:  Much more to come in this one-hour edition of the ""Journal: Editorial Report.""  Still ahead, Hillary Clinton's clean sweep in Tuesday's Democratic primaries leaves her looking for a general election and a potential showdown with Donald Trump, but the billionaire businessman might not be her biggest obstacle on the road to the White House.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(FOX NEWS REPORT)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE & FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: Our next president has to bring our country together so we can all share in the promise of America.  We should be breaking down barriers, not building walls.  (CHEERING)CLINTON:  We're not going to succeed by dividing this country between us and them.  (END VIDEO CLIP)PAUL GIGOT, FOX HOST:  Welcome back to this one-hour edition of the ""Journal: Editorial Report."" I'm Paul Gigot.  That was Hillary Clinton on Tuesday sounding very much like a general election candidates after sweeping all five states up for grabs in the Democratic presidential race.  Her campaign is reportedly preparing their Trump battle plan, but does the Democratic front-runner have her own vulnerabilities to overcome first?  We're back with Dan Henninger, James Freeman and Kim Strassel.  So, Kim, Bernie Sanders got whipped out on Tuesday.  Is the end of his challenge to Hillary Clinton?KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  He was always going to be a very hard challenge.  He came up out of nowhere.  And there was some talk since he had the surprise victory in Michigan that perhaps we were going to see resurgence.  In fact, what she did to him on Tuesday was beat him in most every important group and in states that, if he was going to win anywhere, he should have won them.  So it's very difficult, just not in the delegate map, but in the map going forward to see any path for Bernie Sanders to get to the nomination.  GIGOT:  I guess I would say at least there's a silver lining here in a sense of the trade message, the protectionist message in terms of Bernie Sanders, it didn't really resonate as it had in Michigan.  It kind of fell flat in these other states.  JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR:  Yeah.  The other silver lining is Marxism may be losing --(LAUGHTER)The U.S. is not going to nominate a major party candidate who is a Socialist, Democratic Socialist.  But I think, barring an indictment of Hillary Clinton, this is now her nomination.  Not only did she have the sweep on Tuesday, she has the real delegate lead.  The game has also been rigged by the party establishment to give her all these super delegates.  So that's her insurance policy in case he actually did mount a real charge among actual voters.  So I think, barring a real criminal problem, she's got the nomination.  DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR:  True.  GIGOT:  What did we learn about Hillary Clinton as a candidate in this primarily season?  How does she compare now to what she was in 2008?  (LAUGHTER)HENNINGER:  Well, like she said last week, we're going to put coal miners out of the work.  (LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)HENNINGER:  I can't remember anyone ever running for president saying they're going to kill jobs.  (LAUGHTER)But she has other serous vulnerabilities, Paul.  James alluded to one of them, which is some of the Democratic Party now is Democratic Socialist.  Younger voters in their 20s, by and large, I will say are simply Socialist.  This is their moment.  Bernie Sanders was the vessel for that.  This is something that has been building for a while.  The other vulnerability is her support is pretty weak among male voters.  This raise the question about that Steve Moore did earlier about whether some of these Democratic males are going to say, I'm done with this party, Trump or Cruz appeal to me, Kasich, and I'm abandoning the Democrats because of what they have become.  So she's got a lot of her own unification work to do.  GIGOT:  Yeah, Kim, she has untrustworthy issues, too.  Her net rating was minus 13, Trump's is much higher, but she has real credibility problems.  I guess the question is, you always run -- it's one-on-one in the end of November, so I guess it's vulnerability maybe versus vulnerability.  But the other question is, can Hillary Clinton mobilize enough of the Obama coalition to be able to replicate his majority?  STRASSEL:  That gets to her super big problem, Paul, which is that you've got the vulnerables you have just outlined.  We have seen there's not been a lot of enthusiasm for her out there.  She's been -- the turnout numbers have not been very big.  She's been pushed to the left in order to compete with Bernie for all these voters.  And everyone keeps saying maybe she'll pivot back in the general election.  Maybe she will, but can she convince, if she does, that ascendant wing of the Democratic Party, the liberal people, the part of the Obama coalition, to come out and vote for her on the day that it matters?  That's one of her big problems.  GIGOT:  James, you mentioned the FBI.  Is that her biggest obstacle now, the investigation into her e-mail handling/mishandling of classified information on her private server?  FREEMAN:  That would be the biggest obstacle to the nomination.  As we've been discussing, she has big issues trying to get elected, being so unpopular.(CROSSTALK)FREEMAN:  But, yes, the potential legal problem is there.  And Judge Mukasey, former attorney general, has laid out in our pages what appear to be clear violations of law.  I think if this were any other person not named Clinton, you would normally expect charges.  When we have looked at cases previously -- General David Petraeus, comes to mind -- and people would argue he did far less egregious behavior.  There wasn't this systematic, long-term effort to wall off all communication from not only public scrutiny, but also the security measures we rely on.  GIGOT:  But the Democratic Party is coalescing around Hillary Clinton.  It is uniting.  The Republican Party is still a long way from united.  And divided parties usually lose.  Still ahead, President Obama's Supreme Court pick sets up an election-year showdown with Senate Republicans.  A look at the upcoming battle on Capitol Hill, next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It is tempting to make this confirmation process simply an extension of our divided politics, the squabbling that's going on in the news every day, but to go down that path would be wrong.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT:  President Obama Wednesday unveiling his pick to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court.  The nomination of federal appeals court judge, Merrick Garland, sets up an election-year showdown with Senate Republicans, who, again, this week, vowed not to hold confirmation hearings before November.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  It is the president's constitution right to nominate a Supreme Court justice.  It is the Senate's constitutional right to act as a check on a president and withhold its consent.  The Senate will continue to observe the Biden Rule so that the American people have a voice in this momentous decision.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT:  We're back with Dan Henninger.  And Wall Street Journal editorial board member, Colin levy; and ""Best of the Web,"" columnist, James Taranto, joins the panel.So, Colin, what kind of judge is Merrick Garland?  COLIN LEVY, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  Paul, Merrick Garland is the kind of judge specifically chosen by President Obama to put Republicans on the hot seat.  He's not known as a bomb-throwing liberal, but President Obama knows he'll be a reliable fifth vote on the court, and he knows that, because Judge Garland has a long tenure on the D.C. circuit Court of Appeals.  The D.C. circuit Court of Appeals doesn't hear a lot of hot-button political issues, but they do hear a steady diet of federal regulatory appeals.  GIGOT:  Right.LEVY:  And on those kinds of cases, he has shown significant and consistent deference to administrative agency decisions.  That's something important to President Obama, because he knows the next court will be hearing a lot of challenges to his regulatory agenda.  GIGOT:  So the idea is -- people are describing it as a moderate, but the truth is if he gets on the court, on all of these hot-button issues, he's almost certain to vote with the four liberals to create a new liberal majority?  Is that what you're saying?  LEVY:  Yes, there's no question about that.  If you look at what's happened, even within the liberal minority or semi-minority that's currently on the court --  GIGOT:  4-4.  LEVY:  Yeah, 4-4.  You know, the justices that come on, Kagan and Sotomayor, people said they would be moderates, too, but there's been incredible consensus on the left side.  That's something that Ruth Bader Ginsburg has made a point to encourage.  If you look at Justice Kagan, the last term on the court, she disagreed with her colleagues in single digits across the board, 7 percent, 6 percent, 8 percent, with her fellow justice.  So I think there's no questions he would be in the same category.GIGOT:  And, James, one issue I want you take up, guns, Second Amendment jurisprudence.  Merrick Garland seems to be on the left, disagreeing with the majority on the Supreme Court, by implication, from some of his decisions on the right to bear arms for individuals.  JAMES TARANTO, ""BEST OF THE WEB"" COLUMNIST:  It's probably a safe bet that if Obama or Mrs. Clinton puts a justice on the court to replace Justice Scalia, we can kiss the Second Amendment good-bye.  GIGOT:  As an individual right.  TARANTO:  Right.  GIGOT:  They'll say it's still for the right bear arms in militias but just not individually.TARANTO:  And it will be protected in a lot of state constitutions, but still that was an importance try, advancing jurisprudence that would go away.  GIGOT:  So, Republicans, do you agree with the Republican calculation that they should not vote on Garland, even if perhaps they might get somebody more liberal under the next president?  TARANTO:  If the next president is Mrs. Clinton, I think they should go ahead and confirm Garland after the election.But I want to go back to what Senator McConnell said about the Biden Rule.  The Biden Rule is, in 1992, Joe Biden, when Justice Blackman was rumored to be retired, Joe Biden said we shouldn't have any confirmation hearings during an election year.  Now, this was a replacement of the earlier Biden practice, which he did in 1987 and 1991, when, as now, the balance of the court was at stake.  Biden was chairman of the Judiciary Committee.  What the Judiciary Committee did, it held confirmation hearings and just waged vicious campaigns of character assassination against Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.  The Republicans are not doing that now.  They're just not holding any hearings.  And Merrick Garland, by all accounts, is a decent man.  He doesn't deserve that treatment any more than Bork and Thomas did.  GIGOT:  And he's well qualified, no doubt about it.  But if you did have hearings, inevitably, you're saying, there could be a vicious fight politically, whether or not the Senators would want to do it.  It would be outside groups that would come in and do the dirty work?  TARANTO:  The alternative would be the Republicans surrendering, saying you can change the balance of the court anytime you want, but we can't.  GIGOT:  Dan, the politics of this, people in the media saying Republicans will pay a price for this opposition.  Do you agree?  HENNINGER:  I completely disagree with that idea.  I think James is right.  If they were to simply go ahead and say to the Democrats, you want to change the composition of the court, 5-4, that's the way it falls, the Republican Party would implode.  I mean, this is such a voting issue for Republicans.  To the politics, I don't think it's a big voting issue for most Democrats.  It is for the activists.  But out there in the country, the Supreme Court is not the thing foremost in their mind.  Mainly what they're concerned about is federal spending for groups and things like that.  But for the Republicans, the base, the sort of thing that Colin was talking about, is extremely important.  They would say home in the Republicans caved on this.  GIGOT:  Colin, do you agree with James that if the Republicans lose the presidential race, Hillary Clinton becomes the next president, that the Republicans should confirm Garland in the lame-duck session after the election?  LEVY:  Sure, that makes perfect sense.  President Obama says that's who he wants, and Republicans have said, if Hillary Clinton wins, we'll go with what a Democrat wants, and I think that would be a perfect reasonable way to proceed.  GIGOT:  And the politics, do you think it cuts the same way Dan says?  TARANTO:  I think it probably cuts both ways.  But it cuts both ways anyway.  I expect the results of the Republicans not holding hearings is we'll hear about this it for a week or so, then hear little about it until November.  GIGOT:  Yeah.All right, thank you all.  When we come back, so much for the quagmire President Obama predicted.  After just six months, Russia begins pulling its troops out of the Syria. What did Vladimir Putin accomplish?  And what is the next move?  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA:  An attempt by Russia and Iran to prop up Assad and try to pacify the population is just going to get them stuck in a quagmire, and it won't work.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT:  Well, so much for that quagmire.  In a surprise move, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced this week that he's ordered his military to start withdrawing the main part of its forces from Syria, saying that after just six months his troops largely achieved the combat goals.  Wall Street Journal foreign affairs columnist, Bret Stephens, joins us with more.  So, Bret, how do you read this withdrawal from Putin?  Has he achieved what he wanted?  BRET STEPHENS, FOREIGN AFFAIRS COLUMNIST:  It's a master stroke by Putin.  He achieved exactly what he wanted.  When Russian planes and troops went into Syria last summer, it looked like the Assad regime was very close to collapse.  He managed to transform the battlefield equation.  The Assad regime is now basically -- has been shored up.  It doesn't look like it's going to fall any time soon.  The rebels are on the defensive.  Russia has enhanced its military prestige.  Putin has enhanced his political prestige.   And now he's getting out with very few, if any, casualties.  And his reputation burnished all the way from Tehran to Washington.  So he has proved President Obama exactly wrong while showing that military power can change the facts on the ground.  GIGOT:  You were in a meeting with me this week with those of us on the editorial page, with Gary Kasparov, the Russian opposition leader, former chess champion.  And he took a different view of this in saying he thinks his withdrawal is a sign of Putin's weakness, that he wanted to avoid taking casualties, that the intervention in Syria was becoming less popular in Russia, and he wanted to avoid getting further drawn in.  How do you respond to that?  STEPHENS:  I think he's mistaken.  Obviously, Kasparov is someone always to be taken very seriously for his insight and his great intelligence.GIGOT:  Courage.STEPHENS:  And his courage.  But it seems to me that Putin was able to get out with everything pretty much intact.  Also, I think there's no question that Putin did want a time-limited intervention.  The Russian economy is under stress.  This was costing them some amount of money.  And there was always the risk that there could be an incident, like when the Russian planes were shot down by Turkey.  I think there was some fear of what the Turks might do.  But right now, this looks like, from a Russian point of view, a very clean intervention, a very clean exit for a clear goal that he's achieved.  GIGOT:  Now, one of the other goals that I thought Putin was going for is the -- is to get Europe and United States to ease its sanctions for coming into -- for his invasion of Ukraine.  And do you think that maybe by pulling out here he hopes to say, maybe induce President Obama and Angela Merkel of Germany to say, OK, this gesture by Putin makes it easier for us to ease sanctions and have a reset of Russian relations.  Once again, before President Obama leaves office.  STEPHENS:  Right.  That he is -- he gives the impression he's not a rogue leader, but that he's a responsible leader, seeking a kind of global stability, a man who is willing to step into the breach in the Middle East, a man that the West can do business with.  And quite frankly, you see it with John Kerry's visits to meet with President Putin, with Russia's deep involvement in almost every single diplomatic question.  So I think there's almost no doubt that, at some point, the Europeans are going to say, why do we continue to sanction the Russians at some cost to our own economy?  GIGOT:  And the Iran sanctions.  Russia vetoed sanctions against Iran this week after Iran fired ballistic missiles that could carry a nuclear weapon, in violation of the recent nuclear deal.  But there will be no sanctions at the U.N., and the U.S. can't do much about that, can it?  STEPHENS:  No, that's right.  Because of the foolish way in which John Kerry engineered the restrictions on ballistic missiles, putting it in the hands of the United Nations, where Russia wields a veto.  But, look, Moscow now has a new BFF in the Middle East.  That's Tehran.  They're consolidating a relationship.  By the way, Moscow is looking to be selling about $8 billion worth of arms, sophisticated arms to Iran.  And one of the things that this intervention in Syria did is showcase the sophistication of Russian military equipment.  GIGOT:  So briefly, Dan, President Obama visiting Cuba this coming week, historic visit, first since the revolution in 1959.  Has anything changed in Cuba since the president's rapprochement?  HENNINGER:  Yes, it has.  Life has gotten worse for the dissidents there.  The Wall Street Journal had an article about this, this week.  More people are being arrested, and more sent out of Cuba who have opposed the Cuban regime.  GIGOT:  Dan, Brett, thanks very much.  We have to take one more break.  When we come back, ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT:  Time now for our ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.  Kim, start us off.  STRASSEL:  Paul, a miss to attorney general, Loretta Lynch, who last week told the Senate that she had referred a request to the FBI that it look into prosecuting criminally any groups that disagree with the left's agenda on climate science.  This has become a big, fashionable thing for guys like Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, who are unable to convince the public of the science and their cause.  So now it's suggesting it be better to throw his ideological opponents in jail.  My own suggestion to Ms. Lynch is maybe she could devote more of her time into just figuring out what happened with Hillary Clinton's server.  (LAUGHTER)GIGOT:  OK.  James Taranto?  TARANTO:  Paul, this is a story of the sinister side of political correctness.  A miss to the University of New Orleans, where the chief justice of the student government has put out instructions for right-handed people to check their privilege.  Here's what he writes for us North Paws.  Quote, ""Don't try to silence a left-handed person who complains about scissors hurting their hand or how uncomfortable school desks are to sit in or the struggle of having dirty hands from writing in pencil.""  GIGOT:  There's no censorship, I want you to know among upper left-handed people at The Journal.Dan?  HENNINGER:  Heavens no.  (LAUGHTER)My miss is about pigeons flying overhead, so stay alert.  (LAUGHTER)In London, they are attaching tiny little electronic backpacks to the backs of a flock of pigeons, and these pigeons are supposed to fly around London, detecting air pollution levels, nitrogen oxide and so forth.  The idea of using pigeons to detect pollution brings a lot of thoughts to mind.  I think I'm just going to leave it at that.  (LAUGHTER)GIGOT:  James?  FREEMAN:  Well, this is coming through the lens of my North Paw privilege.  (LAUGHTER)But a hit to the Yale Bulldogs.  First win ever in the NCAA basketball tournament this week.  Their first appearance since John F. Kennedy was president.  GIGOT:  Wow.FREEMAN:  So now the school that invented football also having some success on the hardwood is a pretty good week.  GIGOT:  Shameless alma mater plug.  Are they going to win -- beat Duke?  FREEMAN:  Just a few hours away, they tip off.  And former colleague, Kyle Wanefield (ph), is calling it the Insufferability Bowl.  (LAUGHTER)GIGOT:  And remember, if you have your own hit or miss, please tweet it to us on JER on FNC.  That's it for this week's show. Thanks to my panel and to all of you for watching.  I'm Paul Gigot.  Hope to see you right here next week.
