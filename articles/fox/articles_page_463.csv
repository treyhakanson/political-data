One down, the Iowa caucus, and now it's on to New Hampshire. And who doesn't love the political excitement? And last night in Iowa, we had fun here on ""On the Record."" We launched the now very famous -- world famous - ""Greta Drone."" It's an amazing new way to shoot a story because it gives you, the viewer, a big view - and we all understand the story better when we can see more. But as exciting as last night was, even for us with the Greta Drone, I know the last few months have been pretty raw for the American people. Politics is a contact sport, and a rugged one at that. It has no rules. At least Super Bowl quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Cam Newton have some rules to protect them, but not so in politics. It's so rough. Candidates say awful, awful things about each other and even tell lies about each other. And I'm sure that the political process often disgusts you. But do remember this. While how the sausage is made is ugly, what counts is the final product. And in elections we get a president. It may not be your first choice, or even your second choice, or maybe it's somebody you didn't want at all. But at least we get to vote. We're lucky - that's a democracy.And remember what former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill is quoted as having said, ""Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time."" That's my ""Off the Record"" comment tonight."

There is a lot going on right now, especially in politics. But I thought we should all just take a minute, take a deep breath, and remember some very brave men who, 72 years ago today on D-Day, stormed the beaches on western France. The one who described that day best was President Ronald Reagan. Here's the former president, 32 years ago on the 40th anniversary of D-Day:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RONALD REAGAN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the Ranger daggers that were thrust into the top of these cliffs. And before me are the men who put them there. These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war.(END VIDEO CLIP)Now, if you are related to one of those heroes, I'm jealous because I would have love to know any one of them. They saved the world. We're going to be forever grateful to them. That is my ""Off the Record"" comment tonight."
