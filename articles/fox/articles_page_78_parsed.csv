This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: ""Personal Story"" segment tonight, an amazing situation.We all know Ted Turner who founded CNN, very liberal man, force behind the global warming movement.Well, Mr. Turner has a son, 49-year-old Teddy Turner who is running for congress in South Carolina.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE NARRATOR: A graduate of the Citadel, husband and father of three. Today, Turner is an economics teacher in Charleston.Turner will fight for more freedom and less government, so our families will have a secure tomorrow. Conservative Teddy Turner, for Congress.(END VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: What, conservative Teddy Turner? He joins us now from Charleston. Are you kidding me. How did you get to be a conservative with such a liberal father.TEDDY TURNER, SOUTH CAROLINA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: Well, my dad asks me that all the time, Bill. And I tell you, four years of military college at the Citadel, and two years in the Soviet Union, if that doesn't make you a conservative, nothing will.And, of course, watching a little bit of Fox didn't hurt either.O'REILLY: OK. Now, when you were raised, your father, Ted Turner, he wasn't as liberal as he is now, I understand. Correct?TURNER: No, my dad was pretty tough. He did eight of military school. He was in the Coast Guard. We had a -- there was no sleeping in on the weekends.We did white glove inspections. Dad was tough. He made us work hard, learn the value of a dollar, all the things that our dads should be doing today.O'REILLY: Did he discuss politics with you when you were growing up.TURNER: Oh, absolutely. Our dinner conversations were pretty incredible. I mean, he was involved with all kinds of things and he never -- you know, we didn't get much into the baseball or little league, and that kind of stuff. We were always talking about pretty heavy issues.O'REILLY: Was he then a liberal man. Was he -- you know, did he support the liberal side when you were a kid.TURNER: No, he didn't. I mean, he met mother at a Young Republicans convention. So, he was very -- he was a small business guy and -- before he became a big business guy.But he was very conservative. This change in life has been, later on, mainly started within environmentalism.O'REILLY: OK. Now, you talk to him, I assume. You're running for Congress, would he vote for you if he had -- if he lived in your South Carolina district.Would he vote for you because you are billing yourself as a conservative, small government guy. Would he vote for you.TURNER: Well, I'm not billing myself as conservative. I'm extremely conservative. But I think he would. I spent a lot of time with him in the last couple of weeks and talking about issues.And everything we discussed, he agreed with me. So, we are not that far. And it wasn't because he was agreeing because I'm his son. He's agreeing because it's common sense. And he is liberal in certain issues.But, really, he wants a better world like most of us. But we don't agree on a lot of politics.O'REILLY: All right. So, you guys are -- when you talk man-to-man, you don't have a big fissure. But, I'm sure, he voted for Barack Obama, and you're not going to vote for Barack Obama. So, there is, I guess.Now, the global warming is his big deal, the environmental stuff. Do you believe in global warming. Do you think that it's been caused by carbons and we're the responsibility for this.TURNER: Well, when he drives the Prius to the Challenger, you know, you've got to question a little bit. But he -- you know, what I believe in is clean air and clean water and a future for our kids.I don't believe that my Ford F-250 is causing global warming. I might get a lot of flak for that. But, you know, we can't tax ourselves by going in with things like the Kyoto Protocol and that kind of stuff.So, no, I'm not a believer but I want to make sure that we're still doing the right thing going forward. I just don't like scaring kids and telling them we are cooking ourselves.O'REILLY: All right. So, you want clean water and clean air but you're not buying in to the fact that the human population has depleted the ozone and that's why it's getting warmer.But you said something very interesting there. You said your father drives the Prius to the Challenger, which is a private jet.TURNER: Right.O'REILLY: Do you want to expound on that a little bit.TURNER: Well, you know, his take is, he owns a lot of trees so his carbon footprint is pretty minimal. But --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Oh, it sounds like a rationalization to me.(LAUGHTER)TURNER: Well, it may be that.It's like Catholic indulgences are well in mitigation. I think we can say a lot of the things but when it comes right down to it, we need to have clean air and clean water.But we can't restrict our business because that's the only way we are going to get out of this deficit mess.O'REILLY: All right. Your father helping you finance your campaign?TURNER: Well, he has written me the $2,500 check like a lot of other people have. And I think that's probably all I'm going to get.O'REILLY: All right. Well, Mr. Turner, we wish you good luck, very interesting human-interest story. And we appreciate you coming on tonight.Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC.

2	2	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2013/01/22/politics-inauguration-day/	The Politics of Inauguration Day	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" January 21, 2013. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDNET BARACK OBAMA: It is now our generation's task to carry on what those pioneers began, for our journey is not complete until our, wives, our mothers and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts.(APPLAUSE)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law, for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: President Obama today on this, Martin Luther King Day, envoking civil rights leaders, not only women who launched the suffrage movement but also others in the Civil Rights movement, MLK, as well as others who fought for civil rights. And what about this theme through this speech and his mention of this particular paragraph? We are back with our panel. Kirsten, you talked about it briefly, is he trying to elevate this to become some kind of broader civil rights leader in a way?KIRSTEN POWERS, COLUMNIST, NEW YORK POST: I think that this has become the big issue on the left, especially among younger people. Gay rights is the civil right issue of our time, and so I think that it's something that the president is appealing to.As I said earlier, I think it's why the president can give what I consider to be a pretty milquetoast speech that doesn't really talk about any radical, liberal ideas. He wasn't proposing a single payer plan. He wasn't saying he was going to stop his drone war in Pakistan. He wasn't saying he was going to stop pursuing whistleblowers more aggressively than any other president. He wasn't doing any of the things that I think a lot of progressives are really worried about. And he's able to kind of get covered because he takes these positions, which I agree with. I support gay rights and I think it is great he elevated it. But I think he gets a pass in a way. And I think a lot of liberals are saying that this is very liberal because of that.BAIER: Chuck, there was a quote that caught a lot of people's eye from Dan Pfeiffer, the communication director, and it said this -- he said this, ""There is a moment of opportunity now that's important. What's frustrating is that we don't have a political system or an opposition party worthy of the opportunity.""CHARLES LANE, EDITORIAL WRITER, WASHINGTON POST: Well, that was a nasty crack at the American political system I guess I would say. That's what jumped out at me. And obviously the dig at Republicans is in there, but we've heard that before. I think he walked it back a little later on and tried to say, well, that was just this or that. But that was a rather contentious way to sum up the day.I guess just sort of briefly on what we have been talking about the whole civil rights aspect. There was a feeling about the inauguration of sort of the reassembling of the block-by-block Democratic coalition that was built up to re-elect Barack Obama, which consisted of Latinos, gays, single women, et cetera, African-Americans, et cetera, et cetera, all of whom sort of had their representatives in the inaugural festivities. I think that the people who watch PBS were there, James Taylor, you know, the guy they always have on during sweeps week. It had that feeling of sort of an event for that coalition, right, and less a feeling of, sort of, a completely apolitical or un-political event.BAIER: There's all this talk, Steve about Republicans and the demographics shifting on Republicans. Are the demographic shifting for Democrats?STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: I think they could be. You are seeing the president embrace some of these subgroups that Chuck is talking about, I think precisely, because they were such an important part of his coalition, but also to go back to the discussion earlier, because this is who he is ideologically, this is what he believes. And I think what made the speech ideological was not that it had some long, laundry list of preference group issues, or things that are going to excite liberals, but it was a philosophical defense of liberalism. This is what he was talking about. He was praising collective action and talking about how that was responsible for the progress throughout the course of the U.S. history. That's a liberal view and he was arguing it very forcefully.LANE: Yeah, and defining this moment as a moment where right are what's most important to struggle for.BAIER: We have 20 seconds, Charles. Can he get this through, the progressive agenda? We will hear the state of the union in two weeks. Can he get it through?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Only if he re-wins the House in two years, which is one of his objectives. But it was not a partisan speech. I don't think it was a speech that should be critiqued because it was out of that spirit. It was an ideological one.  He's proud of his ideology. It represents a large section of America, perhaps a majority. He has every right to proclaim it, but I think it's odd if you deny it.BAIER: That is it for panel. But stay tuned, no matter your politics, this ending, if you missed it today, well it's worth seeing it again.Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
