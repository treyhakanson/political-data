"This is a rush transcript from ""Journal Editorial Report,"" April 25, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.PAUL GIGOT, HOST: This week on the ""Journal Editorial Report,"" new questions swirl around donations to the Clinton Foundation and Hillary's tenure as secretary of state. Could past deals derail her White House bid?Plus, he's talking tough in New Hampshire and taking on the issue of entitlement reform. So will it help Chris Christie break away from the GOP pack?And an Iranian convoy headed to Yemen changes course, averting a crisis in the Gulf of Aden for now. Did the U.S. show of force change Tehran's mind or are we still sending mixed messages?Welcome to the ""Journal Editorial Report."" I'm Paul Gigot.Hillary Clinton's campaign is shifting into defense mode after numerous reports this week raised new questions about donations to the Clinton Foundation as well as millions in speaking fees paid to former President Bill Clinton during her tenure as secretary of state. Among the allegations, that a Clinton family charity pocketed over $2 million from a donor tied to a business deal that gave the Russian government a big stake in American uranium production, a deal that was approved by a government committee that included Hillary Clinton's State Department. These details and others were first reported in a soon-to-be released book by conservative author, Peter Schweizer. So do they have the potential to derail her presidential bid?Let's ask ""Wall Street Journal"" columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman; and Washington columnist, Kim Strassel.So, Kim, you've followed the Clinton Foundation for your sins over these many years.(LAUGHTER)What is the most damaging revelation that came out this week?KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST: Well, it's probably this one about the uranium company, because what ended up happening here is this puts the focus on this question, this broader question of whether or not Hillary Clinton in her time as secretary of state was trading favors or doing anything unseemly on behalf of people who were donating money to the foundation. And the problem, Paul, is that there are hundreds of donors to the foundation.GIGOT: Right.STRASSEL: And she was at the center of all kinds of power as secretary of state. The conflict of interest here should have been apparent from the start and that is the fascinating question, why the Clintons think that didn't apply to them.GIGOT: But here's the response from the Clinton administration. There's not a shred of evidence. And I think that's a direct quote. And I love the shred part. Not a shred of evidence --(LAUGHTER)-- saying that there is a quid pro quo here at all involved. And they say prove it. So what's your response to that?STRASSEL: Well, the problem here is that -- I mean, even the Obama administration understood that the issue is the appearance of a conflict of interest.GIGOT: Right.STRASSEL: It just looks unseemly. The only people who don't seem to understand this, because they think the rules do not apply to them, are the Clintons. So they plowed ahead anyway. And the problem for Hillary Clinton is, whether or not there's a shred of evidence or not, these stories will continue to multiply because there are lots of them.GIGOT: And Senator Robert Menendez, James, was indicted recently for alleged quid pro quo corruption. His defense is there is also no evidence of an actual quid pro quo. So the appearances that Kim mentions here are serious, particularly when you are talking about America's chief diplomat.JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: In Mr. Menendez's defense, I don't think there's any evidence that he destroyed tens of thousands of e-mails that might include evidence of the quid pro quo. This is --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: As secretary of state.FREEMAN: As former Secretary of State Clinton has. So this is really going back to the '90s Clinton strategy, where if you cannot convict the Clintons of a felony, then really, what are you talking about here, it's not worth mentioning.(LAUGHTER)I think what is worth mentioning is that Mrs. Clinton has failed to meet the ethical standards she set with the Obama administration in 2008 on disclosure on accepting foreign donations. Didn't disclose the donations tied to the uranium mines, did not get disclose, did not get approval on an Algeria donation either. So this was a very low bar they set. A lot of people would say this is completely inappropriate for them to be accepting any foreign government money. Even with that low bar, she failed to meet it.GIGOT: So, Dan, this is the question. Why did the Clintons cash those checks? The Clintons? Why would they do this? You had to know that this would look terrible if she ran for president of the United States. Bill Clinton accepting money, the foundation accepting money from foreign donors, companies while she was secretary of state.DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Or a Moscow investment bank giving him a speaking fee for $500,000.You know, I think the answer goes back to the 1990s. Back between 1992 and 2000, when they were in power, the modus operandi was stonewall, and they got away with it. I think with the Clintons, I truly believe they do not understand the media and information environment has changed dramatically.  Now all these stories that are coming out feed into a system that includes social media, Facebook, Twitter, blogs, talk shows, and they have a kind of self-multiplying life. It exponentially expands. More people find out about it. And I don't think they quite grasp that you have to find a way to not be pushed over the falls by that force. And so they are just stonewalling. And, look, a lot of younger people who have no idea what Whitewater was, this is the only thing they are beginning to understand about the Clintons. I think it's going to have a damaging effect on her campaign.GIGOT: Kim, the Clintons say the Clinton Foundation is a philanthropy, and technically it's true. But you have also described it as essentially, functionally, a super PAC that has acted on behalf of the Clintons' political ambitions. Explain that.STRASSEL: It is a super PAC, Paul, if you look at it. What ended up happening is when Hillary Clinton finished her last bid for the presidency, all those people who worked for her, all of her campaign staffers, that's where they went and parked themselves. And while they were there, basically, operating a ""get ready for the next Hillary campaign,"" in essence.GIGOT: Right.STRASSEL: They were putting together all kinds of donors, the same donors who were giving money to the Clinton Foundation. Look at the list. They are the people that have signed up first for the Clinton super PAC that's supporting her for president. This is just a shadow political operation.  It's very cleverly done because it's not necessarily subject to the same SEC and other IRS rules that every other campaign organization is.GIGOT: James, what about Dan's point that they took the checks because they think they will get away with it, basically, and they think the Democrats and progressives, who usually hate pay-to-play politics, they hate big money in politics, they hate the 1 percent, that they'll just swallow all this, ignore it and give them a pass in the end. What do you think about that?FREEMAN: I think they'll have to if there's no alternative. But it has me wondering why Elizabeth Warren is not running. This is her window. She is the person to exploit all of these ethical problems with the Clintons, with their big money ties to shady donors, influencing --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: But let's say she doesn't run. What happens? Are they going to mute all this and say, you know what, partisan attacks, ignore it all?HENNINGER: Yeah. I think Democratic professionals are asking themselves the same question, what's coming next. But they are just joined at the hip with the Clintons and they are rolling forward, not in control of their own destiny. I think they would be very, very worried.GIGOT: High-risk politics.When we come back, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie takes his tough talk to the Granite State and takes on the issue of entitlement reform. Will it help him break out of the Republican pack as he eyes a presidential run?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, R-N.J.: If anybody comes up on this stage and wants to talk to you about national defense, wants to talk to you about education, research and development, tax cuts or anything else involving the federal government, you should ask them what they're going to do on entitlements, because if they're not going to do something to fix that problem, we're not going to be able to deal with any of the other problems or opportunities that we have in this country.(END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT: Garden State Governor Chris Christie at the Republican Leadership Summit in New Hampshire last week, taking on his fellow GOP hopefuls over entitlement reform. Though his poll numbers in New Jersey have taken a hit in recent weeks, Christie is setting his sights on the Granite State, hosting town hall meetings and unveiling an ambitious plan to change Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.So, James, what do you make of Governor Christie's, I guess you could call it a presidential comeback strategy? Some people have ruled him out.  Clearly, not him.FREEMAN: Well, I think he does have to do something to set himself apart.  He's looking right now like he's in that second tier of candidates. He's not -- he's going to struggle to get the money and the voters that are now going to Jeb Bush. So --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: He's had some big donors step up recently.FREEMAN: He has. And given super PACs, you don't need that many check writers as long as the checks are big enough this time around. But I think even in that competition, it's going to be hard with Jeb there to soak up those dollars.GIGOT: OK, but do you like this strategy of saying, I'm the truth teller, I'm the guy who is not going to fool you, I'm going to go right at this major problem and, like I did in New Jersey, on pensions and property taxes, I'm going to solve that problem and tell you straight. You like that strategy?FREEMAN: I like it to a point. I like that he is the guy who can make this case. He made the case against government employee unions better than anyone. He made the case for reform. I think the second part of it, though, is that it didn't go that far in New Jersey, and there's a question here. This is a start at what he's talking about but, to be clear, what he's saying now, he's talking about raising the retirement age a few years, he's talking about means testing Social Security benefits --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: Which means that well-to-do retirees get fewer benefits.FREEMAN: Right.HENNINGER: In the future.GIGOT: In the future, yeah. Not right now, retirees, but in the future.You, James, not Dan and me, but you.(LAUGHTER)FREEMAN: Theoretically, yes. The point is that this is not going to solve the Social Security problem, never mind the larger entitlement problem. I would like to see him go bolder, especially if he's thinking I'm a long shot, I want to get out there and try and stretch the debate with some big thinking. I would like him to go bigger.GIGOT: I have to disagree with James on this. Nobody else is running on raising the retirement age right now. Nobody else is running so far on means testing.HENNINGER: Yeah.GIGOT: Those things -- and Mike Huckabee, another potential Republican candidate, criticized him, how dare you --HENNINGER: Yeah.GIGOT: -- this contract with the American people. Everybody knows that Social Security has to change. Doesn't he get credit for saying so?HENNINGER: I think so. One of the knocks on him is that he's one of these eastern moderates. This sort of insulates him from the idea that he's a moderate. This is a very radical idea. It also sets him up as the anti- Democrat because they are proposing raising outlays for Social Security.GIGOT: Yeah, that's right.HENNINGER: And the thing you have to remember about Chris Christie is that people forget he's very lawyerly. He assembles his facts. He just doesn't bloviate. He comes in with a set of facts and he can really present it I think in an appealing way. So he's sort of assembling his persona in a way that I think maximizes what potential he has.GIGOT: Kim, when Governor Christie came in probably about a month ago to talk to us, and he -- the thing that I recall was he said that as running the Republican Governors Association last year, their campaign, he said what I learned is it's all about the candidate. You have a good candidate, you have a chance to win. If you have a lousy candidate, you have no chance. The implication was the presidential race is going to be all about the candidate and I'm a good candidate. When I get on that stage with my fellow Republicans, the American public, are going to see somebody who can make the case in a way that these other guys can't. And he thinks that's going to catapult him back to the frontier. What do you make of that?STRASSEL: Yeah. This is why I slightly disagree with James. I think that that is his best shot because, as Dan says, it fits with his persona, the truth telling, the talking. He is about to -- by the way, the entitlement reform bit is just the first step. He has said he will come out with a bold national security policy, with a big education reform, with a big tax reform, and that these are all going to be coming in the following months.  And he is going to be trying to dare all of the rest of the Republicans who are up there on stage to match him on the big-idea platform. That's what a Republican electorate wants right now. And he's also taking moves, too.  He is giving some checks coming in and he has also been assembling -- he's been hiring some veterans of the Bush campaign, trying to make himself a little less New Jersey insular, and run like a presidential operation. So he's taking this seriously.GIGOT: It deflects the -- as Dan said, it deflects the point that he's just a mushy moderate.FREEMAN: Yeah. I'm all for him going bigger on tax and entitlement reform. I think that would be great for the race. And I don't want to sound too negative. Speaking of him coming to visit us, I can't think of a politician who is more entertaining to spend an hour with.(LAUGHTER)So, yes, he is going to be fun to watch onstage, fun to watch in the campaign. And I wouldn't rule out him catching fire. But he does have a problem. He's got to show results.GIGOT: You mean in New Jersey.FREEMAN: Yeah. They are lacking.GIGOT: Yeah. He's working on another pension reform.When we come back, an Iranian convoy heading towards Yemen turns back, avoiding a potential showdown in the Gulf of Aden. Did a show of force by the U.S. change Iran's mind or are we still sending mixed messages?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT: An Iranian convoy believed to be carrying weapons destined for the Houthi rebels in Yemen turned around and headed north late this week, away from the port of Aden. The about-face came after the United States dispatched the aircraft carrier ""USS Theodore Roosevelt"" to the waters off Yemen this week to join other American ships preparing to enforce a blockade, a move that President Obama said Tuesday was a quote, ""very direct message to Tehran.""""Wall Street Journal"" ""Global View"" columnist, Bret Stephens, joins us with more.So, Bret, why do you think the convoy turned around?BRET STEPHENS, GLOBAL VIEW COLUMNIST: I think frankly, it had only partly to do with the arrival of the ""Theodore Roosevelt."" I think it had a lot to do with the resumption of Saudi air strikes on Aden, on other Houthi targets in Yemen, which told the Iranians that even if their ships got through the blockade, which was a possibility, that the Saudis would bomb them when they were unloading in port.GIGOT: OK.So, Dan, why should Americans care about this conflict in Yemen? I think a lot of Americans say, it's far away, long ago, who cares.HENNINGER: You mean the conflict in Yemen --GIGOT: Yeah.HENNINGER: -- connected to the one in Iraq, connected to the one in Syria?  Look, if you designed an experiment to see how badly the Middle East could spin out of control and get the results we're seeing right here, you've got the Saudis trying to initiate these strikes on their own, instead of going through diplomacy with the Yemenis. This is what happens when the United States pulls out, as we did in Iraq when Barack Obama pulled the troop level down there to zero. You get this result. And you get an impossible situation.I think Iran is sitting fat and pretty. Think of what they just did.  Their standing in the region has risen. They got the United States to move an aircraft carrier all the way from the Persian Gulf through the Arabian Sea up into the Gulf of Aden just for them, all right?STEPHENS: Well, look, all of that is right. We have strategic equities in Yemen. We don't want Iran expanding, continuing to expand its influence and starting a proxy war in the Middle East. That's what's happening in part of Yemen because the Houthies are a proxy of the Iranians. We do not want al Qaeda seizing large tracts of territory. Remember those attacks in Paris back in January. At least one of the brothers who had been an attacker had been trained by al Qaeda --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: They had been targeting American targets here. They almost killed people in Times Square, an agent inspired by al Qaeda.STEPHENS: Absolutely. Even Barack Obama had said that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, before ISIS, was the group that most directly threatened us here at home.And also, if you look at a map of Yemen, you will see that it sits astride the straits that divide the Red Sea with the Indian Ocean, so a lot of maritime traffic crosses through it. We don't want that to be within range of Iranian guns.GIGOT: So we are courting Iran on nuclear weapons, right? Yet we're fighting them, we're saying don't meddle in Yemen. We want the Saudis to be our ally against the Islamic State but we're telling them in Yemen, calm it down, slow down that bombing campaign. What's the U.S. strategy here?  I can't detect it. Is there a consistent one, Dan?HENNINGER: No, I don't think there's a consistent strategy at all, other than President Obama's obsession with getting the Iran nuclear deal.  That's the tail wagging the entire dog in the Middle East. So you have -- I think the Saudis have been put in a position where they are attempting to do something that is above their pay grade. They couldn't do this sort of thing without the support of either Egypt or the United States, but the United States pulled out of Yemen, and they are doing it on their own now.GIGOT: Do you detect a strategy here?STEPHENS: This is part of the Obama approach of saying the nuclear deal is separate from Iran's regional ploys, its support for terrorism, its support for --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: -- over here.STEPHENS: You can't do that. Certainly, the Saudis aren't doing it. The Saudis can't separate the fact that Iran may be on the cusp of a nuclear capability with the fact that they are now increasingly surrounding Saudi Arabia. So this is going to draw us in willy-nilly whether we would like to pretend these are separate issues or not.GIGOT: Should we get in more?STEPHENS: I think we have to for a couple reasons. I think we have to show the Saudis that we support them. We have to show the Iranians that we are prepared forcefully to stop the Houthies and we have a vital interest in making sure that southern Yemen does not become what Afghanistan used to be for al Qaeda.GIGOT: A sanctuary.We have to take one more break. When we come back, ""Hits & Misses"" of the week.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT: Time now for ""Hits & Misses"" of the week.Kim, first to you.STRASSEL: Paul, another miss to the IRS, which just clocked one of its worst customer-service periods during tax time ever, a situation it blamed on budget cuts from Congress. We now have a new report from the House Ways and Means Committee saying that, in fact, it was the IRS that decided to cut its own customer service budget and spend its money instead on, for instance, $60 million in bonuses for IRS employees and to allow employees to continue spending loads of work hours working on union activities. So the IRS, the biggest mess it's ever been.GIGOT: All right, Kim, thanks.Bret?STEPHENS: This is a miss for William Jefferson Clinton, our former president. Just this week, the ""Wall Street Journal"" informed us on the front page that North Korea may soon be in a position to double its nuclear arsenal to 40 weapons. This is the result directly of President Clinton's misbegotten framework nuclear deal from 1994. That was an attempt to negotiate, to make sure that a rogue regime didn't get nuclear weapons.  The deal went south, the north got nukes, and we are doing the exact same thing in Iran.GIGOT: Dan?HENNINGER: Paul, a media miss. This week after the drone strike in Pakistan that killed two aid workers, unfortunately, the media went into kind of a weird frenzy of concern about re-looking at the drone program from top to bottom. Look, this drone program is killing homicidal maniacs who want to commit mass murder against Americans and the rest of the world.  I certainly hope Barack Obama does not step back on the drone program.GIGOT: It's a tragedy that those two men were killed but, as you say, they are targeting bad guys. We didn't know they were there.And remember, if you have your own hit or miss, tweet it to us at JERonFNC.That's it for this week's show. Thanks to my panel and to all of you for watching. I'm Paul Gigot. Hope to see you right here next week.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Welcome back to the special edition of ""Hannity,"" How to save America. Now, while the CPAC speeches, they're drumming up a lot of chatter about potential GOP candidates for 2016, who is actually going to make the run for the White House? Joining me now with his take is former Pennsylvania senator, former candidate himself, Rick Santorum. Rick how are you?RICK SANTORUM, R- FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm doing great, Sean. Great to be on your show again.HANNITY: I watched you. I was out on the trail with you. I know what a grind it is. Are you advising people to do it, not do it? It's a tough road.SANTORUM: It is a tough road. But I'll tell you what, there really is no greater experience in politics than getting out there and having that kind of interaction with voters from all across the country. You really learn how diverse this country is, how great this country is. And, you know, I always tell people you know, if you have a desire to do it, there is no reason not to do it, you know. It really is an amazing experience.HANNITY: Do you have a desire to do it again?SANTORUM: I'm certainly looking at it pretty seriously, Sean. I think there are a lot of lessons learned from a couple years ago. And there certainly are a lot problems out there that you detail very well throughout your shows that things are getting worse, not better. And maybe on a little change from the -- from someone who really believes in founding principles of our country is what we need.HANNITY: Who would be your competition? I think Rand is pretty much in. My guess is that you might see a governor or two, Rick Perry might get back into it. I wouldn't be surprised to see Scott Walker, Paul Ryan, maybe Ted Cruz may get in, Marco may get in, maybe Bobby Jindal. What do you think?SANTORUM: I think there is more. I mean, you've got John Kasich in Ohio. There may be other governors, you know. You look at a Rick Scott in Florida to get reelected. There are a lot folks out there that are going to look at this. Mike Pence from Indiana, there's another. There are a lot of really good people out there. That is great. What we found in the last race, and we found in every race, is that the process takes its toll and moves people in and out. And that process is a good one. It really does help get the right candidate in the end.HANNITY: All right, senator, good to see you. We'll see who is going to win tomorrow's CPAC poll. Good to see you, senator. I know you had a great reaction so far.SANTORUM: Thank you, Sean.Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2014 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to ""Hannity."" Coming up tonight, my direct rebuttal to the president and the State of the Union. That's coming up.But first, 10 U.S. Navy sailors were released from Iranian custody earlier today. Now, yesterday, Iran commandeered two U.S. vessels that American sailors were traveling on in the Persian Gulf. Now, Iran was claiming that the vessels entered its territorial waters.And after the sailors were back in U.S. custody, the rogue regime in Tehran released a video of when they were seized showing the sailors kneeling, with their hands behind their heads.But it gets worse. This afternoon, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard put out a video of a U.S. Navy lieutenant apologizing to Iran while he was in captivity.Now, some say this could be a violation of the U.S. military code of conduct. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was a mistake that was our fault, and we apologize for our mistake. The Iranian behavior was fantastic while we were here.  We thank you very much for your hospitality and your assistance.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Clearly coerced.And earlier today, Secretary of State John Kerry even praised Iran for returning the captured sailors. Really? Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE: I also want to thank the Iranian authorities for their cooperation and quick response. I'm appreciative for the quick and appropriate response of the Iranian authorities. All indications suggest or tell us that our sailors were well taken care of, provided with blankets and food and assisted with their return to the fleet earlier today. And I think we can all imagine how a similar situation might have played out three or four years ago.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Here with reaction, State Department spokesman John Kirby is with us. Mr. Kirby, good to see you, sir.JOHN KIRBY, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: Good to be with you. Thanks very much, Sean.HANNITY: Simple question. Do you acknowledge that Iran is a state sponsor of terror?KIRBY: Absolutely.HANNITY: OK. And a state sponsor of terror -- will you acknowledge that they have assisted in fighting proxy wars, including battles against Israel?KIRBY: Absolutely.HANNITY: All right, so they're not really a regime that can be trusted, fair statement?KIRBY: We've never said that we're in a trust relationship with Iran. Far from it. In fact, we've said quite the opposite.HANNITY: Why would John Kerry thank them for releasing sailors they never should have taken?KIRBY: Well, the circumstances of how the sailors fell into Iranian hands is still being investigated, but the reason we thanked them is because they did work quickly on the diplomatic side to secure their release.I mean, Iran's a government, like many others, that not everybody is operating with the same amount of information. But through his connection with the foreign minister and a relationship that's been forged over the course of so many months, he was able to secure their release, and the foreign minister was able to work with the military elements in Iran to get them released.I think that's -- you know, that's what we should really be focused on now...HANNITY: Well, I...KIRBY: ... that they're safe and they're sound and none of them were hurt.HANNITY: I think most Americans are looking at these guys with their hands behind their head, and I understand one woman had to cover her hair in a particular video.KIRBY: Sure.HANNITY: When I look at this Iranian Revolutionary Guard video, did you get the impression that that was coerced? I got that impression.KIRBY: Well, I think the Navy's going to investigate that. It very well might have.HANNITY: What did you think?KIRBY: Well, I mean, I'm not in a position to judge. I mean, I wasn't there, and I don't know this young officer, but I can tell you that the Navy's going to take a look at that. They're debriefing the sailors right now, and I'm sure they'll get as much information as they can.HANNITY: All right...KIRBY: Our focus here at the State Department truly was on trying to work the connection that we had. And before, you know, this Iran deal, we didn't even have that connection. So we wouldn't have been able to secure the release as quickly as possible. I mean, I can almost assure you that had it not been for Secretary Kerry's quick intervention here, those sailors would most likely be in Iranian hands.HANNITY: Let me -- let me move on...KIRBY: Our purpose was on getting them out.HANNITY: Let me move on to this deal which now is apparently going to go into effect. Help me out and my audience out because this is how I see the deal, very one-sided.KIRBY: Sure.HANNITY: I see that the Iranians will get $100 billion to $150 billion of frozen assets. I see the Iranians are still allowed to partner with the Russians and build missile defense, which could hurt our allies, Israel if they feel that they're a clear and present danger to their safety and security.I see that they get to build conventional weapons. I see that they get at least 24 days' notice. In some instance, I've read that they might even have the opportunity to pick the inspectors.What did America get out of this Iranian deal, where they continue to spin their centrifuges? What did we get out of this?KIRBY: Well, what we got was an Iran that signed -- you can read it in first page of the document there, Sean, an Iran that has committed to not pursuing a nuclear weapons program. They will not acquire a nuclear weapons program. And if they try over the life of this deal, we'll be able to know because we now have a very, very strict inspection...HANNITY: But do you believe them? They're a state sponsor of terror.  They fight proxy wars.KIRBY: It's not...HANNITY: You believe them.KIRBY: No, Sean, it's not about belief and this is not about trust, which is why we insisted on a very, very tough inspection regime to be in place...HANNITY: Why not any time, anywhere?KIRBY: ... in Iran because we're not going to build this on trust.HANNITY: Why not any time, anywhere? Why 24 days, and why in some instances, do they pick the inspectors?KIRBY: Oh, I didn't -- I'm not aware of any ability for them to pick the inspectors. The 24 days -- we talked about this before. That's a maximum.  It's not going to be the norm. And what's important here is that the IAEA -- and they're not there yet, by the way, Sean. They haven't got to implementation day. We think it's going to come soon. But they still have steps they need to take. In any event, the IAEA will be the ones to determine whether or not...HANNITY: Do you trust them?KIRBY: ... things need to be looked at -- absolutely, we do.HANNITY: I don't.KIRBY: Sure. Absolutely, we do.HANNITY: All right, let me ask you -- you actually said about Syrian refugees that it is a possibility that ISIS will infiltrate the refugee population. You said that. James Comey has said that.KIRBY: I did.HANNITY: The president's envoy, General John Allen, to defeat ISIS has said that. The assistant FBI director has said that.KIRBY: Sure.HANNITY: And yet the president is still insisting that we take in at least 10,000 Syrian refugees, probably more over time.And my question is, you can't -- how do you possibly ascertain whether or not a refugee has aligned itself (sic) in its heart and mind with ISIS?  Because this is part of their strategy. They've been successful in Europe.  They've been successful, apparently, in Turkey. Why -- how do we possibly ascertain whether or not this is an ISIS sympathizer or not when we take them in?KIRBY: It's going to be very difficult, Sean. And that's why the -- that's why the vetting program in place for refugees, in particular Syrian refugees, is between 18 and 24 months and it requires multiple checks and multiple agencies in the federal government to screen them.HANNITY: But you don't deny...KIRBY: Now, look...HANNITY: ... that they might be able to be trained to break into that population, do you. It's possible they might be able to infiltrate.KIRBY: We are certainly -- we're certainly mindful of that risk, which is why we're taking it so seriously and why it takes so long.HANNITY: And if we get it wrong...KIRBY: And look...HANNITY: If we get it wrong, Americans might die, so we might be gambling with their lives.KIRBY: We don't want to ever do that. We take the safety and security of the American people more seriously than anything else, which is why we have this process in place and why it's so hard for a Syrian refugee over so many months to get into the country. But look, it's -- you know, they only have to be right -- a terrorist only has to be right once. We have to be right 365 days a year...HANNITY: Yes. How about -- why not set up...KIRBY: ... 24 hours a day, and we try.HANNITY: ... a system, like Jordan has set up a safe zone. Why not send food, water, medicine, cots, supplies, baby formula and not take the risk that ISIS will infiltrate, as you acknowledge could happen? Why take that risk?KIRBY: You know, it's funny you should -- it's funny you should ask that because what we're trying to do through the political transition process, the Vienna process on Syria is to make all of Syria a safe zone, to get a government that isn't run by the dictator Bashar al Assad, one that is representative and responsive to the Syrian people. We want all of Syria to be a safe zone. And that's why we're working so hard...HANNITY: All right...KIRBY: ... on the political process.HANNITY: Last question. If you were to take -- if you were communicating with somebody else in the State Department, maybe even John Kerry, and John Kerry said to you to remove the heading and the classification and send it to me, would you do it?KIRBY: Well, look, I'm not going to get into hypotheticals, Sean. And I - - you know, I'm not going to speak to...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: It's not a hypothetical because Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, actually requested that of an employee.KIRBY: I won't get into her past e-mail practices here. That's not our role. Our role is to make those documents public. As you know, Sean, there's some reviews and investigations going on about those practices, and it wouldn't be prudent for me to talk about that or comment.HANNITY: All right. I do appreciate -- you're, like, one of the few people in Obama's administration that will even talk to me. And that wasn't so hard, was it?(CROSSTALK)KIRBY: No, I've always enjoyed...HANNITY: Go ahead.KIRBY: I've always enjoyed coming on your show, Sean.HANNITY: All right, we appreciate it. And maybe you tell the president.  Put in a good a word for us, OK?KIRBY: Yes, sir.HANNITY: All right, thank you.And coming up -- President Obama claimed in the State of the Union that it's strong, but that couldn't be further from the truth. We'll set the record straight with my State of the Union response.Then later, reaction to the president's big speech and Iran releasing 10 U.S. sailors. We'll check in with Lou Dobbs, Frank Luntz and Charlie Hurt.  They're here to weigh in tonight.Plus, the DNC chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, sinks to a new low and claims the Republican Party has a diversity problem because why? They picked Nikki Haley to give the response last night.That and Tavis Smiley tonight on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" So the president made some very bold claims last night in his final State of the Union address, but it's time for a reality check and my comments on the real state of the union.On the economy the president said this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:  Anyone claiming that America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)OBAMA: Now, what is true, and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious, is that the economy has been changing in profound ways.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, reality check. When you look at the numbers, well, Obama is the one peddling fiction about the economy. For example, take a look. During his time in the White House, median household income, when adjusted for inflation, has been completely flat and hasn't actually recovered fully since he's been in office.The labor participation rate is near a 40-year low and has been under 63 percent now for 21 consecutive months. And instead of putting people back to work, under this president, the number of Americans dependent on government is surging. A near record $45 million Americans currently receive food stamps. That is an increase of 42 percent since January 2009.As for poverty, the president talks about helping every American get ahead, but this again has not been the case. Since 2008, the poverty rate has shot up 17 percent. 46 million Americans now live in poverty, and the dream of owning your own home has been made a nightmare under Obama for many Americans. The rate of those who own a home has now dropped several percentage points. Now, we also saw record numbers of foreclosures during his presidency. 2011 was the worst year on record for home sales.And under the president, our national debt has reached very dangerous levels. In January 2009, when he took office, it stood at $10.6 trillion.  Well, it's almost $19 trillion today, a 77 percent increase. By the time he leaves the White House, he will accumulate more debt than every other president before him combined. And because of this massive accumulation of debt, for the first time ever, America's credit rating was downgraded in 2011.And that's not all. Now, last night, when he wasn't misleading you, the public, the president also took shots at the GOP front-runner Donald Trump and his proposed Muslim ban. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: We need to reject any politics, any politics that targets people because of race or religion. When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad or our fellow citizens, when a mosque is vandalized or a kid is called names, that doesn't make us safer. That's not telling it like it is. It's just wrong.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, so as Newt Gingrich pointed out on Twitter last night, quote, ""As President Obama defends Muslims and mosques, he's being watched by two nuns whose religious liberty he threatens. No word about Christian beheadings, either.""And when you look at the data, it's clear that Obama has become the divider-in-chief. A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows that race relations in this country are at a 20-year low. Only 34 percent of you, the American people, think that race relations are good. 64 percent say they're bad.And politically speaking, the president has not ever been a good leader of his own party. We can't forget when he came into office, he had a filibuster-proof 60 seats in the U.S. Senate and 257 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Since winning that election in 2008, get this, the Democrats have lost 11 governorships, 13 U.S. Senate seats, 69 U.S. House seats and over 900 state legislative seats.Plus, according to the latest CBS News/New York Times poll, just 27 percent of Americans say the country's on the right track, compared to 65 percent of us who say it's on the wrong track.And the scary thing is this is just the tip of the iceberg. We can go on for days talking about the president's failures and numerous scandals.  Now, that's the real state of the union.Now, here with reaction to all of this, editor-in-chief of Lifezette.com, FOX news contributor Laura Ingraham. Also Fox News senior correspondent, our friend, Geraldo Rivera.Geraldo, that's my State of the Union.GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: It was quite stirring. I thought you'd be a great leader. You should contemplate running for office.HANNITY: You want my show? Are you going to take over the slot?(LAUGHTER)RIVERA: Yes, that's a good idea. You run for president. I'll take the show.Let me start where I agree, race relations are worse than they have been at any time since the Civil Rights movement. I think that what that portends, though, and the real reason for that is the nation was not ready for a black president. We are absolutely divided. On one side, you have...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: But white America voted for him, Geraldo, in huge numbers!RIVERA: If I had been Barack Obama, I would have taken the mantle, I would have gone with it, I would have been in the neighborhoods, I would have been everywhere, I would have talked about race, rather than trying in an Ivy League way to avoid dealing with the issue.HANNITY: It's more than that. When he did speak out, it was the Cambridge police, it was Trayvon Martin, it was -- it was...RIVERA: In very clumsy fashion. But he should -- if I were him, I would have seized the historic opportunity to try my best to lower racial walls.  He has failed utterly in that regard, but he had plenty of help, and I think that it is distressing to me that the Republicans are appealing, basically, to white Christians. There aren't enough white Christians (INAUDIBLE)HANNITY: I don't agree with that analysis. But let me go to Laura.  Laura, I look at the state of the economy, the president couldn't cite any real success last night -- double the debt, home ownership, people in poverty...LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Sean...HANNITY: ... people...INGRAHAM: Sean, listening to your monologue just now, I was thinking to myself, why didn't you deliver the rebuttal to Obama's State of the Union?  That was awesome! OK, that...HANNITY: Thank you.INGRAHAM: You just -- you just absolutely leveled it in that monologue.  And that's what we need, right? We need clarity.This is not about personality. I think most people have nothing personal against President Obama. I think it's great that we had a first African- American president. I don't think there's anything about race or skin color that impacted the economy.I think what we have is we have a nation that is not working. We have most of the job growth since, frankly, the year 2000 has gone to both legal and illegal immigrants. So they've done actually better, as far as getting jobs, than most native-born people in this country. The CIS (ph) did a great report on that.So we know that. We know, Sean, that as you pointed out, average median income has gone down about $1,052 since January of 2008. Now, it's not at it's all-time low, but that's still a chunk of change that people are missing out of their wallets because this recovery really didn't reach most Americans. I agree with Bernie Sanders on that...HANNITY: You know...INGRAHAM: ... hasn't reached most Americans...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Laura, these are millions of people out of the labor force, millions of people in poverty...INGRAHAM: 94 million.HANNITY: ... more people, millions of Americans on food stamps, more than we had. I didn't even talk about ""Obama care."" I didn't even talk about him ceding Iraq and Syria.(CROSSTALK)INGRAHAM: Just one more thing, Geraldo, then I'll shut up and you can talk. But it was very interesting. You look back at Ronald Reagan, for whom I worked. Job growth among African-Americans during the Reagan era, 2 million net jobs created for black America. Black business receipts up by -- from $12 billion to almost $18.5 billion. Black entrepreneurship thrived. Black middle class income -- 40 percent of black Americans became middle class during the Reagan years, moreso than the lower tier.It was -- it was -- it was much a better era, even though I think a lot of black Americans think, Oh, Ronald Reagan didn't like black people -- free market policies, when properly tethered to good trade policies and better immigration policies...HANNITY: Well said!INGRAHAM: ... works for all people.RIVERA: But how about saying that the United States is the envy of the world right now. We have 5 percent unemployment. Yes, there are too many people out of the labor force...HANNITY: Geraldo...RIVERA: ... but you can't argue with 5 percent unemployment.HANNITY: I can -- no, I can...RIVERA: You can't argue with 292,000...HANNITY: Geraldo...RIVERA: ... jobs added in December.HANNITY: If you use a calculator -- wait a minute! If you use a calculator that doesn't count the chronically or long-term unemployed, I can argue with that and say that those numbers are phony and false and fraudulent and deceptive and lies!RIVERA: I would love to hear your rebuttal to the George W. Bush final State of the Union. I think it's way too partisan. You can't just...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: What did I say that was wrong?RIVERA: Politics is bad for optimism.HANNITY: You're not going to dispute any facts!RIVERA: Politics is bad for optimism.HANNITY: Listen...RIVERA: You spin with the people who are out of the job force.HANNITY: There's no spin!RIVERA: I say 5 percent is almost full employment. I want to know who doesn't have a job that really wants a job?HANNITY: Geraldo, 94.5 million Americans out of the labor force!(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: ... inequality. Why not be in favor of raising...INGRAHAM: But Geraldo...HANNITY: ... the minimum wage?HANNITY: Let me bring Laura back in.(CROSSTALK)INGRAHAM: Yes, I would say, you know, then why does 65 percent of the country think we're going in the wrong direction? Why do people give President Obama such terrible marks on the economy? Geraldo, you're right, they gave George W. Bush terrible marks on the economy in 2007, 2008.  You're right about that. You know, I spoke about it, and I know Sean talked about it extensively.So this really isn't partisan. This is about what policies work and what policies don't work. And that's what the country's grappling with. And there's going to be partisanship, of course...RIVERA: To me, the biggest flaw...INGRAHAM: ... but that's what people are grappling with.RIVERA: The biggest flaw in the president's presentation, which wasn't bad -- it wasn't great, but it wasn't bad -- was his kind of passing over or fluffing over the Syrian situation. We have so many dead people. We have chaos in the region. I think the Arab spring stuff -- I would have, were I him, say, You know, something? I haven't been perfect, and where I've failed the worst maybe is in the Middle East and...HANNITY: Geraldo...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: I could have talked about ""Obama care."" I could have talked about the Web site. I could have talked about the IRS, the bad treatment of vets and the scandal there. I didn't talk about Libya, the red line in the sand with Syria or ceding to ISIS Ramadi, Fallujah, Mosul and Tikrit...INGRAHAM: Open borders!HANNITY: ... you know...INGRAHAM: Open borders.HANNITY: ... open borders or Crimea and Ukraine, all under his watch. It has been a disaster! And I don't know why you're defending it.RIVERA: You defend it because I'm trying to be realistic, Sean. The nation today, economically speaking, is far better than it was at the end of George W. Bush's term.HANNITY: Oh!(CROSSTALK)INGRAHAM: ... wages not going up.RIVERA: ... now we have 5 percent unemployment.HANNITY: He's not listening!INGRAHAM: Wages aren't going up, Geraldo.(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: You can't argue, Laura, about wages not going up and then be opposed to a raise of the minimum wage...HANNITY: Let me get back to Laura.(CROSSTALK)INGRAHAM: That wouldn't solve it. That doesn't solve it. I don't have any -- if we want to raise the minimum wage, if that's what really floats your boat, then let's do that and close down the border so we don't have people flooding the country still lowering wages for the working poor and the middle class...(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: But a lot of it is true. What about what Nikki Haskell (ph) said?HANNITY: Nikki Haley.RIVERA: Haley.(CROSSTALK)INGRAHAM: When she was attacking Trump?(LAUGHTER)RIVERA: Maybe she's not as big a deal as we think she is.HANNITY: I was mad at her, too. I was mad at her!RIVERA: I thought that she was right about some -- when you keep screaming fire in the theater, people at some point are going to say...HANNITY: You know what, Geraldo?(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: You have a nice car. You have a nice house.INGRAHAM: Right. You do well.HANNITY: But there are millions of Americans out of work, millions of Americans in poverty and food stamps, and he put them there! He's done nothing to help them!RIVERA: No, Eddie Haskell put them there.HANNITY: Laura?INGRAHAM: And Gerald- and, Sean, I would just say, you know, Nikki Haley is a lovely person, is a lovely woman, but I mean, we have, like, 50 percent of the Republican voters in her state who are right now supporting Trump or Cruz!HANNITY: Or Cruz, yes.INGRAHAM: I mean, what's the point of, like, attacking those people as loud or they're somehow anti-immigrant? They're good people! They just want the country to work better.HANNITY: You can't ban all people from a certain religion and be...HANNITY: Laura...(CROSSTALK)RIVERA: ... American values.HANNITY: Geraldo is going to vote for Trump. I promise you.INGRAHAM: Oh, totally. Absolutely.HANNITY: He can't help himself. He's going to do it.RIVERA: It's a possibility. We'll see.INGRAHAM: Yes, he loves Trump.HANNITY: All right, guys. Good to see you both. Happy new year.And coming up, reaction to the president's State of the Union address, and of course, Iran releasing those U.S. sailors. I'll check with Lou Dobbs, Frank Luntz and Charlie Hunt. They're next.Plus, DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz in hot water over comments that she made about Governor Nikki Haley and the GOP's, quote, ""diversity problem."" Kirsten Powers, Katie Pavlich are here to weigh in.And the one and only Tavis Smiley is here, and we may actually agree tonight. Straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" So last night, while Iranian forces held 10 U.S. Navy sailors, President Obama made no reference to that outrage during the State of the Union address. Instead, the president praised the Iranian nuclear deal.Here with reaction, from the Fox Business Network, our friend, Lou Dobbs, pollster Frank Luntz, and from The Washington Times, Charles Hurt. Good to see you all.Frank, you were focus-grouping last night. I think it's one of the worst deals I've ever seen in my life. I went over that earlier with John Kirby.  What was the reaction of your focus group?FRANK LUNTZ, GOP POLLSTER: I have to give you credit first. You've been very tough on your guests from time to time, asking them very challenging questions. Sean, I listened to your interview. And you prosecuted this case.You demonstrated Iran's culpability better than anyone that I've seen, and you deserve tremendous credit because you got the State Department finally to admit the truth. It's one of the reasons I've encouraged people to go see ""13 Hours."" They have to see that movie about Benghazi because that tells the truth about what happened.You delivered that in about a five-minute interview better than I've seen anyone do.HANNITY: I appreciate that.LUNTZ: In terms of the...HANNITY: I wish it wasn't going to happen, though. I wish it had more impact, Frank.LUNTZ: But you know what? You've got what, 2 million, 3 million people who watch you every night. You've got 4 million people, 5 million who listen to you every day. You've got more impact than you realize.And that interview should be played as often as possible because it teaches people how to get the truth out of this administration. Our audience laughed when Barack Obama talked about Iran giving up its nuclear weapons.HANNITY: Wow. They laughed last night?LUNTZ: They laughed. Even some Democrats laughed because they simply don't believe this government. And as that speech is being given, of course, these Americans being taken -- I'll use the word ""hostage."" It was against their will. No one holds the administration accountable, and nobody demands the truth.And those two attributes, accountability and the truth, are exactly what the public is looking for. They don't believe they get it from Iran. They don't believe they'll get it from this agreement. And thank you, you just did a tremendous service for the country.HANNITY: Thank you, Frank. You know, Lou, you know the economy better than anybody I know. You and Neil Cavuto are two people I really count on when I want to know information about the economy.I just rolled off in my rebuttal to the State of the Union, you know, labor participation rate, poverty rate, unemployment rate, all of these numbers, all of -- all these millions more Americans suffering under this president -- foreclosures, et cetera. How bad is it, in your view?LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS: It's bad. And you're exactly right. In your response to the State of the Union, you're talking about reality. But whether it's Iran, as you prosecuted the case, as Frank said, so ably, with John Kirby, the former admiral at the State Department as their spokesman - - I mean, there's no answer beyond it's a mess.There are people in pain. And we can talk about a five percent unemployment rate. The reality is that when you take into account the discouraged workers that you mentioned, the people who have detached themselves from the workforce, given up, I mean, we're talking about a double digit unemployment rate. We're talking about wages that haven't grown in this country for the middle class in the last 30 years.We have to get to the reality. And we have a president who is creating a new reality. He calls it a fundamental transformation, but whether it's foreign policy, whether it's domestic policy, whether it's economic policy, whether it's Iran, this is nothing more than fantasy.HANNITY: Let me ask you this. If I'm a CEO, Lou, or CFO of a company, and I decided to do math the way they do in Washington, you don't count the chronically unemployed or the long-term unemployed, why do I think that I would be handcuffed, fingerprinted, perp-walked, and put in jail for a long time? How do they get away with these phony numbers?DOBBS: Because it has become, you if will, the code, the language and the value structure of both political parties over the course of time. We have two political parties right now that are not buying in the open. We are watching a presidential campaign, in my judgment, Sean, that is the most open, the most revelatory, the most engaging in my career. I don't know what Frank would say to this, but I'll tell you, the American people are watching what is happening up close. They are watching our combativeness over issues that matter, whether it's illegal immigration, whether it's free trade, whether it's Russia, whether it is minority unemployment and the quality of life for all Americans.I mean, we are watching candidates who can't seem to -- who before couldn't seem to speak the truth who are now being engaged and I think principally, and I'll say it out loud here, principally because Donald Trump brought it, and he means to have a direct, open dialogue. And the nation, if nor nothing else, owes him for that.HANNITY: And Charles, you've been a support of Mr. Trump, and you cannot deny the numbers. Now it's just a matter of do people show up for him?CHARLES HURT, THE WASHINGTON TIMES: Yes. And you know, watching the State of the Union address last night, and sort of the -- I found my head exploding after nearly every line, especially when he turned on Republicans and began lecturing them about how they need to put away the voices of their base and start, you know, legislating from a more noble high ground.  It was absolutely mind blowing. And this is why so many people are flocking, I think, to Donald Trump.But going back to what you said, Sean, not only would you be frog-marched into prison if you ran a company with accounting practices the way these people do, if you ran a retirement fund for people the way these people run Social Security, you would be shut down, put in jail for running a Ponzi scheme.HANNITY: You're right.HURT: You'd be roommates with Bernie Madoff right now.HANNITY: Lou, I was watching you after the last debate. I ran into in the hall and I said you did a great job both pre and post-debate. We'll be watching tomorrow night. Are you going to be there?DOBBS: I'm going to be there. We'll be kicking it off at 5:00 for the early debate, 6:00 p.m. eastern time. It's going to be a hoot. And 9:00 for the primetime debate, and we'll be in between. We're sort of kind of fielding and finding our way.HANNITY: Thanks for taking my audience. We really appreciate you taking my audience for the night. Thanks a lot.(LAUGHTER)DOBBS: We appreciate the borrowing, and it's very generous of you.HANNITY: No, we're only kidding. You've earned every bit of it. We'll be watching tomorrow night. Thanks, Lou.And don't forget, tomorrow night Republican debate, Fox Business Network, our sister station, Sandra Smith and Trish Regan kick things off at 6:00 p.m. for the first debate. Then at 9:00 it's Maria Bartiromo and my buddy Neil Cavuto tomorrow night, Fox Business Network. And of course Lou will have all the coverage post-debate.DNC Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz under fire for saying the Republican Party has a diversity problem.And later tonight, Tavis Smiley is back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TAVIS SMILEY, PBS HOST: Every leading economic issue, on the major economic issues, black Americans have lost ground in every one of those leading categories. So for the last ten years it's not been good for black folk.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Tavis Smiley holding nothing back on the Obama presidency. He joins us tonight.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Shultz is coming under criticism for saying the GOP has a diversity problem.  Joining us now, author of ""Assault and Flattery, the Truth about the Left and their War on Women,"" Katie Pavlich, and Fox News contributor Kirsten Powers. To say that is so insulting, Kirsten, it's hardly worth mentioning. You wrote the best column I have ever seen. And it's about --KIRSTEN POWERS, COLUMNIST, ""USA TODAY"": Really?HANNITY: -- how times have changed as it relates to Bill Cosby and Bill Clinton. You know, this allegation is not going away, is it?POWERS: No, it's definitely not going away. And the point of my column is that during that time period, and I recounted a lot of the ways that women were talked about by Democrats, no less. The dismissal of Paula Jones as essentially trailer trash and things like that. People just aren't going to tolerate that kind of stuff today. And I think that what Debbie Wasserman Schultz said is falling in a similar category. It's no longer OK, thankfully, to say that a woman only is being called on, a governor of a state, is only being called on to do the response to the State of the Union because she's a woman and she's a minority, right. And hopefully we're getting to a point where this is a line that people are recognizing just shouldn't be crossed.HANNITY: I think Donald Trump has done us all a favor, Katie, by saying you can accuse me of sexism like happens every presidential election? No, I'm putting it right back on you. And it really seems to have silenced the Clintons on this because there's so much vulnerability.KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I certainly appreciate Donald Trump bringing up the Clintons and especially Bill Clinton's misgivings towards women. I don't know if we can't say that he hasn't had his own war of words on women. But when it comes to the situation --HANNITY: But Katie, their words, the allegations against Bill -- I'm not talking about the consensual relations, which were numerous. But these are serious charges of assault.PAVLICH: I am not saying they're equivalent. In fact, I wrote an entire book about this very issue, including an entire chapter on Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton and how Hillary Clinton essential enabled Bill Clinton and allowed him to get away with sexual assault and accusations of rape against women.And the bottom line here is this -- progressives have to come to terms with this idea that Hillary Clinton is running on a platform about being all about empowering women. She's running on a platform of standing up for sexual assault victims. It's very difficult to do that when you were engaged not only in the cover-up of what was going on with these women, but you also helped drag them through the mud. Today you have Debbie Wasserman Schultz in charge of the DNC essentially --HANNITY: Let me ask Kirsten this. Do you agree with Katie on that? Do you agree that Hillary has the big problem in terms of the enabling part?PAVLICH: Well, I think that, yes, maybe it needs to be proven more, and maybe Katie does this in this book, because people say this a lot, but then a lot of it is hearsay. I know Carl Bernstein had reported in his book about Hillary being very integral to working with Betsy Wright with the so- called bimbo eruptions and things like that. So I think there have been a lot of accusations about Hillary doing that.But even if she hasn't done that, frankly, she would still have a problem.  And this is what I wrote about in my column. She's tweeting out the standard feminist line now that all sexual assault victims must be believed. What that means is they must be believed even when they've been discredited.HANNITY: That's a good point. They have a right to be believed.PAVLICH: And so she's put herself out there taking up this mantel in order to panders to certain voters, frankly, and she's going to hold other people accountable to that, then she is going to have to be accountable in the same way.HANNITY: All right, good to see you both. Happy New Year.And up next tonight right here on ""Hannity"" --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SMILEY: On every leading economic issue, on the major economic issues, black Americans have lost ground in every one of those leading categories.  So for the last 10 years it's not been easy for black folk.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Tavis Smiley not mincing words. We might agree tonight. That's straight ahead. He's in studio.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" So race relations under president Obama has been a disaster. As we told you earlier, according to a recent ""Wall Street Journal""/NBC news poll, only 37 percent of Americans believe race relations are fairly good or very good.Here with reaction, author of ""The Covenant with Black American Ten Years Later,"" PBS host Tavis Smiley. Good to see you, my friend.SMILEY: You, too, Sean.HANNITY: We go back, we've been friends for a long time. We started our careers together, literally, on some other network. I have great respect for you. I'm glad you're telling this story, because under Barack Obama black America has not done well, nor has the rest of America. But you specific are talking about black America.SMILEY: First of all, thanks for having me on, as always. First of all, as to the poll, it's unfair to lay race relations worsening at the feet of one guy. No one guy is responsible for race relations.HANNITY: He did say he'd bring us together. He's been very divisive.SMILEY: He has a lot of things he did get done and other things he didn't get done. I just don't want to blame all that on one guy. And in some ways we green-screened Obama thinking he could do anything and everything.HANNITY: Not me.SMILEY: Many Americans did. He ain't Jesus. He don't walk on water. He can't do everything.You brought up the book, though. The book came out originally 10 years ago before Obama ever showed up to run for president and win in 2008. So this is not about him per se, but it is true that 10 years after this book black Americans have lost ground in every major economic category, and that's just unconscionable and unacceptable.HANNITY: Listen, I laid out my response to the State of the Union. It's not good. America's in decline, 94.5 million Americans out of the labor force, 50 million in poverty, 46 million on food stamps, and we're talking about tens of millions more since he became president.I don't know what your life was like growing up. If I didn't have jobs in the summer when I was kid, I'd be in trouble. I don't know about you.  That would be for me. I always had a job. And 50 percent of black teenagers can't get a summer job. That tells me, what are their options?  They're going to be hanging out with their dopey friends like I would have been hanging out with my dopey friends.SMILEY: I couldn't agree more. I had a job every summer myself. I know that feeling. We've been raised the same way.I think the problem is this, that the suffering of black people for too long, even prior to Obama, the suffering of black people has been rendered invisible. Poverty is now threatening our democracy. It's now a matter of national security as far as I'm concerned.HANNITY: I agree with you.SMILEY: And so not enough has been done. I judge this president like I judge any other president. So it's not about Obama bashing. For me I judge you by Kingian standard. King talked about what he called the triple threat tearing our democracy apart. What was the triple threat? Racism, poverty, and militarism. Racism, poverty, and militarism. So I look at the president and give his laundry list of things he thinks we ought to judge his legacy on, and he's got a lot done. Don't get me wrong. A lot of headwind, a lot of obstruction, and he got a lot done. But on racism, poverty, and militarism we lost ground.HANNITY: I tried to sound the call about Obama, because I always thought he was a rigid, radical ideologue, and I think I've been proven correct. I don't believe leftism, socialist, redistribution works either.SMILEY: You believe Obama is an ideologue?HANNITY: Radical ideologue. He's an Alinsky disciple. You don't sit in the church of Reverend Wright, the church of ""GD America"" and say America's chickens have come home to roost after 9/11 and not have radical views.  You don't hang out with Bill Ayers and not have radical views.SMILEY: I think calling President Obama radical is far off. He's anything but. He's anything but.HANNITY: He got everything he wanted passed. We didn't have shovel ready jobs. The stimulus didn't work. Healthcare is a disaster.SMILEY: Did you just say he got everything he wanted passed?HANNITY: Yes. Hang on a second. He got his health care plan passed. He got his stimulus passed. He got a son of stimulus passed. He promised shovel-ready jobs. We have more American out of the labor force than ever before. We have more people in poverty than ever before.SMILEY: I can offer you, as you well know, I won't waste the time because you know it, a list just as long or longer of the things Republicans obstructed him on from doing.HANNITY: When it happens all he does is a rule through executive fiat, executive amnesty.SMILEY: He's done that on a number of things because the Republicans have not wanted to work with him. Mitch McConnell kept his word from day one.  My job, Mr. President is to defeat you. He's kept his word.HANNITY: Listen, I am sad I feel I was so right about Obama. I wish I was wrong, because I think fewer Americans would be suffering. Let me ask this question. Are you open to a Republican president? Is there anybody you see running you could support?SMILEY: I am open to any president who is not pushing an agenda that is antithetical to the best interests of black people. Sadly, not a lot of them are on the Republican side.HANNITY: If black America has done so poorly under Obama then we have to ask if someone can stimulate the economy, maybe we'd have fairer trade laws in the country. If somebody is going to control the borders where so many illegal immigrants are competing for jobs in this country, won't that be good for everybody in America?SMILEY: In theory, yes.HANNITY: In theory? In reality.SMILEY: In reality, it would be as well as long as the persons were reading this book.HANNITY: Read the book? It's going to be good? Read the book.SMILEY: You're being funny. It will be, though, if we take seriously what is in the book. And my point is on health, on education, on the economy, on environmental justice, on reforming the criminal justice system, of the 10 issues in this book there is only one issue that I can see Republicans until now suggesting that they might work with us on, and that is criminal justice reform.HANNITY: Control the borders, less competition for jobs, increases opportunity and wages. How about that? Do we agree on that, control the borders?SMILEY: I'm all for controlling the borders, but an anti-immigrant stance, the one Donald Trump is taking?(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: He said until we can ascertain because ISIS has a plan to infiltrate the refugee population. Until we ascertain who they are, I agree with them.SMILEY: Good spin.HANNITY: No spin, truth. All right, good to see you.SMILEY: Good to see you, Sean.HANNITY: All right, coming up, we need your help with tonight's ""Question of the Day."" It's an important one, straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: It's time for our ""Question of the Day."" So was it actually appropriate for John Kerry, our secretary of state, to thank the Iranians for releasing our U.S. sailors that they never should have taken? You know my place on that, my position on that. Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you think.That is all the time we have left this evening. As always, thank you for being with us. We'll see you back here tomorrow night.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
