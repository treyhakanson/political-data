This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" November 1, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, we are officially just one week away from Election Day. Wow. I know. And tonight new polling suggests this thing could be getting tighter, all the way to Election Day.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everybody. I'm Megyn Kelly. Seven days out a brand-new ABC Washington Post tracking poll shows a virtual dead heat.  Look at this. Donald Trump taking the lead in this poll at 46 percent to Hillary Clinton's 45 percent. Just over a week ago, she had a 12-point lead in this tracking poll. 2016, everybody. 2016. I know. It's like, it's like this. Right? It's like, wait, what? It comes just days after the dramatic news that the Clinton email investigators are back to work on the case. And in the days that followed it would appear that is contrary to many headlines you may have seen yesterday elsewhere, that is having an impact on this race.Take a look. According to the polls, support for both candidates had been climbing in recent weeks, that is until this weekend. While Trump backers stayed steady, team Clinton suffered a drop of eight points when it comes to voter enthusiasm. In a moment we'll take a deep dive into all of the latest numbers with Larry Sabato and Karl Rove.But we begin tonight with our chief political correspondent Carl Cameron reporting tonight from Eau Claire, Wisconsin where Donald Trump just held a rally. Carl?CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Megyn. And I warned you ten days ago that the polls always tighten in the final days and that this one was going to go right down to the wire and it certainly looks that way. Trump today put a perfect illustration on what's become his one two punch on the closing argument. He began today in Pennsylvania, Valley Forge as a matter of fact, and there he gave a speech about his plans to repeal and replace ObamaCare.Not once did he mention the FBI emails. He was trying once again to give voters cause to vote for him. Then he came here to Wisconsin and at this speech, he unleashed on Clinton and the emails. He went through his contract for the American voter -- the various things he's going to do.  But the Trump campaign is preparing to unload on Podesta tomorrow and he gave a little taste tonight. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: John Podesta has been caught saying, we have to dump all of those emails. Can you believe this?  That's WikiLeaks. And he also said to me this made a big statement. John Podesta, I'll tell you what -- if he worked for me I would fire him so fast. He is such a nasty guy. I would fire him, like ""The Apprentice.""  John, you're fired.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)CAMERON: The Trump campaign success in the polls and his discipline on the campaign has a lot of Republicans, a lot more optimistic than they've been in the last few weeks. But tonight he's in Wisconsin. A state where he trails on the polls. This morning he was in Pennsylvania, a state where he trails in the polls. And a lot of GOP members think, you know, Ohio and Florida is really tight.Maybe he ought to be emphasizing more time, money and ground game in those really close battleground states and maybe leave some of these on the edge to themselves for a while. He's trying to expand the battlefield but there's a question about whether his organization and money is going to pull him over the top on his must wins like Ohio in Florida -- Megyn.  KELLY: Wow! Carl, good to see you. Spent a lot of time in Eau Claire, Wisconsin back when I was practicing law. And now what I remember is, the place I stayed, the front desk girl was the same girl who would bring you your room service and she would bring your bag up. Four women worked so hard, that one hotel. It's a small town and -- there's news to discuss.  Okay. So, we have big changes when it comes to the FOX News electoral outlook just seven days out. Our decision desk made four changes, four, four today to its map, two in Donald Trump's favor, two more in Clinton's direction.Trace Gallagher has the latest live from our L.A. Newsroom. Trace?  TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Megyn, this time last week in the Electoral College map, Donald Trump appeared down and out. This week he's still down but far from out. And the big reason is movement in what many consider the grand price battle ground state of Florida, which the FOX News decision team is now moving from lean Democrat to tossup. Hillary Clinton's support in Florida has remained very steady but Donald Trump has now picked up a couple of points.For Trump, Florida is a must win and now at least it looks like he could win. FOX News is also moving Nevada from lean Democrat to tossup. The Decision Desk acknowledges that Democrats have an eight-point lead in early voting in Nevada but Republicans are making up ground. And if the GOP can boost Election Day turnout, the silver state could go red. It's been more than a half century since Alaska voted for a Democratic presidential candidate but the Decision Desk has now moved it from solid red to lean's red.Although our team admits the polling in Alaska is a bit all over the place.  Finally North Carolina now shifts from tossup to lean Democrat. That's based on Clinton leading in 21 of 23 North Carolina polls listed by Real Clear Politics. So, here's the bottom-line. If Clinton wins the states rated solid Democrat along with states leaning Democrat, she's the next president because she only needs 270 to win. If Trump wins the solid Republican states along with the states leaning Republican, he gets 174 Electoral Votes. If he then wins all of the tossup states, that adds another 77, giving him 251. He would still need to flip at least one, likely two states that lean Democrat. Difficult but certainly not out of the question -- Megyn.KELLY: Wow! Trace, thank you. So, with the map in that kind of play, where exactly should these candidates be focused?Joining me now, director of UVA Center for Politics, Dr. Larry Sabato and FOX News political contributor and former deputy chief-of-staff to President George W. Bush, Karl Rove. Great to see you both.So, Karl, if you were advising Donald Trump right now, where would you tell him to go? That is the most valuable asset he has right now, his time?  KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. I call it, seven and seven. He's got seven days and he's got to cover seven states which is a very large number of states to be focus on as you come down the end. He has to win Iowa, Florida and Ohio where he leads in the Real Clear Politics average. So, he's ahead in all of those, the RCP average. But that only gives him 244. He's also got to win North Carolina which Mitt Romney won in which in the RCP average, he's behind. That still gives him only 259.  I'd spend less time in Ohio and Iowa where he's ahead and more time in Florida which is absolutely critical and North Carolina where he's behind.But it's still not enough. So, he's got to pick three of these states, Nevada, New Hampshire, Colorado, Wisconsin, Virginia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, that's roughly the order starting from the one word that he's closest to the one there, he's furthest away. And the Real Clear Politics average, I hope he's got better data. So he may have a different order with these. But he's got to find enough -- he's got to pick three of these states. Any combination of winning two of them will give him the White House as long as he carries these other four.  KELLY: What are the odds of that right now, just as a political prognosticator? What kind of battle is that? What you say, Karl?ROVE: That's uphill. He's still coming from behind. And he's got to be not diverted. Don't worry about Georgia. Count on Arizona either coming home. Don't be diverted by her going there. Don't worry about Utah. It's either going to come home or it's not. He probably going to come home.  Don't spend your time in New Mexico, you don't have a chance of winning there. Focus on the seven states that are absolutely critical to win, four that we know about and three that he's got to make a decision about.He can't get there by simply winning the four that we know about. He's got to figure out where else he is spending his time, think about it this way.  He's got maybe 25 to 28 events that he can have between now and the election and he's got to spread them out in states that get him 270 electoral votes and seven is a big number to be spending your time and in seven days but that's what he faces.  KELLY: And he has to be relentless about going there. Larry, you see this ABC News Washington Post tracking poll and now Trump is up and she was up 12 points about a week ago. I mean it's really stunning. I know that you look at the averages of all polls. You don't look at one poll or the other. But does this tell you anything?LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR, UVA CENTER FOR POLITICS: Well, sure. I mean, frankly, Megyn, I'm pretty upset with you. You didn't send me a white board. I'm at a great disadvantage to Karl.  KELLY: You got a lot of free pillows.  SABATO: I know, I got from free pills but teachers always have to buy their own supplies and it really teases me. But anyway, as far --KELLY: Thank you.SABATO: -- as the Washington Post ABC poll, I would be interested to hear what Karl thinks. But any poll that shifts, I believe it's a total of 15 points or somewhere at 13 points in a week and a half, that's a questionable poll.  KELLY: Oh. Shade at ABC and WaPO --  SABATO: Well, I'm just saying what I really believe which is what I always do. In the polling averages of course it's gotten closer because partisans have been coming home to Trump and that was happening even before Director Comey did what he did last Friday.KELLY: Uh-hm.SABATO: But believe me, his actions have sped that up. And you know, two points is substantial. Let me point out four years ago at this very moment, the RCP polling average had Mitt Romney up eight tenths of one percent.KELLY: Uh-hm.SABATO: Well, a week later he lost by four points. Four points. Five billion votes to President Obama. So, while I use polling averages, I also admit that they can be off too. Nothing is perfect.  KELLY: Uh-hm. Because you're saying 2.2 because that's what she's up in the average of all polls there which is what Larry looks at. What do you make of it Karl. Because I know team Trump feels heartened by this poll, by the IBD poll, by the LA Times poll, you know all of which are showing momentum for Trump and that in fact Trump may be up right now.  ROVE: Yes. Well, first of all, let me set the record straight. Sabato wants a free white board. I bought my own white board, Sabato. I bought my own. They were not given to me. I worked hard for him.(CROSSTALK)I worked hard for him. You know, I love how you free -- you academics living in your Ivory Towers want free this and free that. I earned this by the sweat of my brow. Right here, in fact, I got two white boards, man. I got two of them.  SABATO: We'll send one to me. Bernie Sanders would have given me a free white board.KELLY: Hello. Can we get back to the news?SABATO: Yes. Okay.ROVE: I agree with Dr. Sabato. I'm a little bit dubious about a poll that goes 13 points in ten days. I want to see a little bit more -- look, I don't trust the L.A. Times, USA poll that uses a weird methodology, they're not even willing to step forward in defend. I do think the race has been closing. It closed before last Friday. I think we'll see on Wednesday and Thursday and Friday of this week how much it's closed once we get past the Halloween weekend. But it is closing, no doubt about it.  KELLY: Wow. Great to see you both. Christmas is coming. I think I know what I'm getting these guys.  Well, the polls are not the only problems for team Clinton today. As new headlines on Hillary's emails leave one former FBI leader to compare the Clintons to the mob. Former FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom is next along with former Obama Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton.Plus, calls are growing for a major investigation over at CNN after a high profile contributor is accused of helping Hillary Clinton cheat at two presidential debates. Tonight, we have an exclusive interview with the former CNN Chief Jon Klein. Don't miss this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Where did you get it?DONNA BRAZILE, POLITICAL ANALYST: You know, as a Christian woman I understand persecution but I will not sit here and be persecuted. Because your information is totally false.  KELLY: I'm getting it from Podesta's email.  BRAZILE: Well Podesta's emails were stolen. You're so interested in talking about stolen material --KELLY: So you deny it?(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Seven days from right now, polls will be closed in more than half of the states. We may be close to knowing the next president but there will still be one very big and ugly question out there.Fox News digital politics editor Chris Stirewalt raced it in his column today when he wrote that quote, ""The odds that the next president would serve a full term are probably not as good as you would like. With Hillary Clinton facing multiple investigations and Donald Trump facing a big civil trial and maybe more, things could quickly get dicey for our new president elect.""Joining us on that, former FBI assistant director in charge James Kallstrom along with former President Obama deputy press Secretary Bill Burton.But first Trace Gallagher has more on the issues here. Trace?GALLAGHER: Megyn, if Hillary wins the White House, Republicans are already promising to launch investigations, Utah GOP Congressman Jason Chaffetz who cheers the House Oversight Committee calls it a target rich environment or as Fox News political analyst Chris Stirewalt says, quote, ""The options available to Republicans in Congress for the next potential Clinton impeachment are a ""veritable salad bar of fixin's.""  And I'll tell you what, Wisconsin Republican senator Ron Johnson thinks the email scandal will continue to haunt Hillary. Listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. RON JOHNSON, R-WIS.: You know, you cannot conceal, you can't destroy them. And by the way, that statute is penalized by fines, imprisonment and disqualification from holding any office in the United States.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: And House Speaker Paul Ryan believes there's a mandate to keep investigating Clinton considering that only about a third of voter say, she's honest and trustworthy. If Donald Trump becomes president, there stands to be many trips between the White House and the courthouse. Mr. Trump is still defending himself against charges that his Trump University was nothing more than a real estate course intended to bilk students out of money. Trump has also threatened to file lawsuits against the women who have accused him of sexual assault. And VP nominee Tim Kaine says, Trump's campaign comments are also in the mix. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TIM KAINE, D-VA., VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: When Donald Trump went on the air publicly and said to the Russians, hey, go ahead and hack away, and if you find something that helps me out, let me have it. We impeached a president for that, what he has encouraged Russia to do.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: So far only President Nixon has left office early. Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were both impeach by the House but acquitted in the Senate -- Megyn.KELLY: Trace, thanks.Well, our next guest, not only says folks at the FBI are upset with the way this Clinton investigation was handled, he's comparing the Clinton clan to organize crime.James Kallstrom is the former assistant director in charge of the FBI.  Jim, good to see you.JAMES KALLSTROM, FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IN CHARGE: Hi, how are you?KELLY: So, you say, you know, that actually this blows Watergate away in your view, what the Clintons have done, what Hillary has done. Why? I mean, get specific on this.  KALLSTROM: Well, the pay for play. I mean, the foundation that gives less than six percent of the money to charity, according to reports that I've read. You know, the way they treated the Haitians I think is a classic example. Well, they collected all of this money and very little of it went to Haiti.KELLY: Uh-hm.KALLSTROM: And this goes on and on. I mean, it's just -- and look at WikiLeaks. I mean, look at the emails themselves and the complicity of staff. And it just goes on and on. I mean, the lying is just --KELLY: You have not given Director Comey a pass on this show.  KALLSTROM: No.  KELLY: And certainly, you know, not in July, when he decided not to indict her because you thought he had the goods. But what do you make of what he did this time? Did he do, you know, did he do the right thing?KALLSTROM: Yes. I've been pretty tough on Jim because I think the investigation was not a real investigation. There was no grand jury, no subpoenas, no search warrants. That's not an FBI criminal investigation.  That's not the way they're conducted.  KELLY: Why? Why would he do that?KALLSTROM: I just think he could -- for whatever reason, he didn't stand up to the politics of this thing, for some reason. I can't get in his head.KELLY: Okay.KALLSTROM: I thought he was a great guy. I think he's done the right thing now. I think he had no choice. He's between a rock and a hard place. I mean, for the New York office and other offices to be, you know, giving him this information about what's on Anthony Weiner's computer, it's got to be something very substantial.  KELLY: The code red moment.  KALLSTROM: Yes. It's a code red moment. I mean, they only had the metadata initially. You know, they had the authority to look at certain things about Weiner, you know, in his activities.KELLY: Yes. They see the metadata there and --  KALLSTROM: Yes. They see all of this metadata and they see all of these metadata and they probably look at a few of these things just to get an idea actually what's there, does it involve Weiner, you know, and they see some smoking guns or some big explosions.  KELLY: So, they bring it up, I mean, they bring it up actually to the second in command is what we're told and then some time passes and suddenly Comey is like wait, what? And he comes out. Now, do you believe because, you know, some people say the FBI has gotten a black eye. They got a black eye in July when Comey didn't indict but then came out and said she was a liar basically.KALLSTROM: Yes.KELLY: And then this time around the roles are reversed.  KALLSTROM: Yes. But let me be clear about one thing. The FBI getting a black eye is not the agents. It is not the guys that work there and the girls that work there, and the ladies that work there. You know, it's the people that run the organization for whatever reason did what they did.KELLY: Uh-hm.KALLSTROM: But I think now he had no choice. I mean, you know, he's given this major information. What is he going to do? Talk about it after it leaks out? Talk about it, you know, who knows, you know, who knows what that even is? They haven't been involved --KELLY: They're working hard and their morale is low.  KALLSTROM: Yes. Very low.  KELLY: Because they can't defend themselves.  KALLSTROM: Exactly.  KELLY: You're a Trump supporter. You admit he's made a lot of mistakes.  KALLSTROM: Yes.  KELLY: You're past those mistakes.KALLSTROM: Yes.KELLY: You're still voting for Donald Trump. Explain why.  KALLSTROM: Yes, Megyn. I'm not a politician. I've never come out for any politician. I have a actually very low regard for most of them. And you know, but I consider myself a patriot. I mean, maybe that's a bad word in today's age which is a shame, quite frankly. But I think he would do a better job at keeping the United States what the United States is supposed to be. You know, getting our culture back. Our culture has been demeaned tremendously. Look at our education system. I mean, just look at everything about the country. We're in huge debt. You know, we're not doing things right.We're not dealing with the world right. We're not dealing with our military, our police officers. They're treating them like crap. I mean, we're just not doing the right things and I think he'll do a much better job than Hillary. She's got too much baggage. The Democrats are to blame here because they put someone up to run for president that has a long trail of lying. I mean, she went to Andrews Air Force Base when the bodies came back from Benghazi, one of which was a son of a dear friend of mine and told those families, look, we're going to arrest the guy that made the videotape. You know, he's the person responsible for the death of your sons in those coffins right there.  KELLY: Yes. We've had family members testify to that. She denies it. I mean, one dad has contemporaneous notes, you know, in his record book.KALLSTROM: It's what she did. I mean, how can we elect someone that would do that thing.  KELLY: Great to see you, Jim.  KALLSTROM: Okay. Thank you.KELLY: Joining me now with reaction, former Obama White House Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton. Bill, good to see you. Snazzy with the glasses tonight.BILL BURTON, FORMER OBAMA WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: Get to see you, Megyn.KELLY: I like that look.BURTON: I'm going blind, getting old.  KELLY: You could see, I mean, there's already talk of who's going to get impeached, it's like, who is going to get elected, who's going to get impeached, how soon can the hearings begin?BURTON: Look, you know, after you hear all of the stuff about Republicans and how they want to have hearings on this and hearings on that. How about a hearing on job creation or wage growth or education or something that actually matters in the lives of Americans. After this election, the email issue will have been so litigated that the American people will be really ready to move on to that issues that actually affect them in their lives. And if they see a Washington, if they see a Republican Congress that is continuing to focus on something that doesn't affect their lives, I don't think that it's going to play out well for them.  KELLY: But it's like a character -- it's a character issue, right? I mean in the same way you look at Trump --BURTON: No it's not a character issue.  KELLY: Let me make the point and then you respond. But in the same way you look at Trump and his alleged history with women, you say, all right if he did those things, that reflects on who he is as a person and that's something we need to know. You look at her and if she's lying and misleading and dodging and weaving with the FBI and surrounding herself with people who do the same, it's a character issue for her.  BURTON: Donald Trump joked about sexually assaulting women and then a bunch of women came forward and said that he actually had groped them and been inappropriate with them. Yes, that is a character issue. Hillary Clinton has said that it was a mistake for her to do exactly what Condoleezza Rice, exactly what Colin Powell had done, exactly what the Bush administration had done.  (CROSSTALK)KELLY: If you well know, if the FBI were investigating Barack Obama, when you were working for him, before he was president when he was running, and they say, we need all of your documents, anything he's forwarded you, anything that relates to this private server he's keeping in his Chicago home, this isn't fantasy world, you would have gone, you would have checked your home computer, you would have forked it over, Bill. Why didn't she?  You understand when people say, I don't understand or trust these people or these decisions.BURTON: Right. Look. It's hard to comment on the warring factions inside the FBI who are leaking and counter leaking and saying all sorts of things about who forked over what. We have a small piece of information from Director Comey that he stumbled into the presidential election to release at best. And so I don't know what Huma gave up or what she didn't give up.  But that's not the point. The point is, it's the exact same thing that the Republicans had been doing for years before and the American people are done with it. Like yes, Trump supporters are --KELLY: What Hillary did has --(CROSSTALK)BURTON: Yes, there are folks who don't like Hillary Clinton do not.KELLY: Okay.BURTON: It is exactly the same. It is exactly the same.KELLY: No, what do you mean with Colin Powell? Is that what you're talking about? It's not the same at all and it's been disputed --  BURTON: With Powell and with Bush administration.  KELLY: No.  BURTON: Next time Colin is on, ask him about all of the Republican emails that were destroyed --KELLY: You well know that nobody has a home brew server and did all of their business exclusively on it and then destroyed documents after they received a demand letter from the FBI and FOIA request and so on and so forth. I don't have time to litigate it.  BURTON: Megyn, actually they do the exact same thing. And Karl Rove was under investigation at the time.  KELLY: Okay. Even if that were true, which it isn't, two wrongs don't make it right. Pointing to people's bad behavior to justify other bad behavior never works. But I can see that Hollywood hills are calling. I want you to go enjoy that with his nasty glasses and we're going to see you again before Election Day. Great to see you, Bill.  BURTON: See you, Megyn.KELLY: So, as we get closer to the votes being counted, some folks on the left are going hard on Mrs. Clinton's critics.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BEE: If Hillary is president, what do you think will be the female equivalent of you weren't born in this country.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: We'll show you how the President handle that one with Sheriff David Clark and Democratic strategist Julie Roginsky.Plus, CNN says it had nothing to do with one of its best known contributors sneaking questions to Hillary Clinton ahead of a debate. Tonight in a ""Kelly File"" exclusive, we'll speak with the former president of CNN about what he thinks on how this situation is being handled. Don't go away.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: You got the WikiLeaks release of March 12th Podesta emails showing you messaging the Clinton campaign with the exact wording of a question asked --BRAZILE: Kelly --KELLY: -- at the March 13 CNN TV One town hall debate.BRAZILE: Kelly --KELLY: Where did you get it?  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: From the world headquarters of Fox News, it's ""The Kelly File"" with Megyn Kelly.KELLY: One week out from election. Did we mention that? And president Obama is making his final push for Hillary Clinton. Recently sitting down for an interview with comedian Samantha Bee and suggesting that Mrs. Clinton's critics are driven by sexism. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, ""FULL FRONTAL""/TBS)SAMANTHA BEE, HOST: If and when Hillary is president, what do you think will be the female equivalent of you weren't born in this country?PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I think the equivalent will be she's tired, she's moody, she's being emotional. When men are ambitious, it's just taken for granted, well, of course they should be ambitious. When women are ambitious, why? That theme, I think, will continue throughout her presidency and it's contributed to this notion that somehow she is hiding something.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: It's not the first time President Obama has invoked gender into the race. Last month he told attendees at a Clinton fundraiser, quote, ""There's a reason why we haven't had a woman president. We as a society still grapple with what it means to see powerful women."" Joining me now, Sheriff David Clarke of the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office and Julie Roginsky, Democratic strategist and a Fox News Contributor. Great to see you both.JULIE ROGINSKY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you, Megyn.KELLY: I love when Sheriff wears his hat. Sheriff, your thoughts on the president's comments.DAVID CLARKE, MILWAUKEE COUNTY SHERIFF: Well, you know, Barack Obama for seven-plus years has played the race card that every time somebody criticized him it was because he was black and it scared off a lot of Republicans so, now they're going to switch and try to play the gender card.The problem is the American public is tired of this class warfare. The reason why they don't like Mrs. Bill Clinton is not because she's a woman, it's because she's dishonest and because she is hiding something. She's hiding the truth. She tries to play herself off as a victim like she's little Red Riding Hood, but she's more like the big bad wolf. As soon as you turn your back on, she'll bite you.Now look, this is politics. It's a contact sport. It's not for the faint of heart. My response to what president Obama said is if she can't stand the heat she should get out of the kitchen.KELLY: Julie.ROGINSKY: Well, first and foremost, I think you just proved my point, sheriff. And you know, we're not numbered (ph) last week and I love you but she's not Mrs. Bill Clinton. She happens to be Hillary Rodham Clinton who is her own person and is running as her own individual. She's a former senator. She's the Secretary Of State. She's not Mrs. Bill Clinton and I think you just encapsulated exactly why a lot of women think that she might...CLARKE: It's not my job to give you her bio.ROGINSKY: It's not her bio but it's also not your job to assume that she's just a little woman who's married to...CLARKE: She has run with that name for a long time.ROGINSKY: Well, she's run for that name because she happens to be married to the former president but she's certainly not Mrs. Bill ClintonCLARKE: Right, she should embrace it.ROGINSKY: Well, no, she actually shouldn't embrace it. She should embrace the fact that she's a very accomplished (inaudible) in her own way, a very accomplished woman in her own right, and you just prove your point.KELLY: Let me ask you this, Julie. Let me ask you this. Do you think there's something to the notion that many Americans find the idea of a female president somehow threatening? Do you think there's anything to that?ROGINSKY: You know, unfortunately I do and it's a shame because I think that your polling showing -- poll after poll showing of Anna Greenberg, who's a very prominent pollster saying that her numbers went up when he focused specifically on women's issues whether it's standing by her man when she was first lady after the Monica Lewinsky scandal or working on women's -- traditional women's issues or even working as Secretary of State for Barack Obama who's a man.But her numbers are not so great when she's running for something, when she's working on health care reform, when she's become a principal and taken on roles that are traditionally men's roles. And I think unfortunately, I hate to say this because as a woman who is living in the 21st century, I would hope this is not the case but empirical data shows unfortunately that it is the case.KELLY: You know Sheriff, I remember eight years ago when Sarah Palin was on the Republican ticket, they were doing full articles about how she was going to balance her situation of having, I think, five kids and being vice president. I was just like, basically for lack of a better term, screw you were writing that, right. Because nobody was wondering how Barack Obama was going to balance having two kids.CLARKE: Megyn. Megyn, you took the words...KELLY: So it's still there to some extent.CLARKE: Right. Megyn, you took the words out of my mouth when you mentioned Sarah Palin because the way the Democrats treated Sarah Palin was nothing short of shameful. Also the way they treated Condoleezza Rice when she was the Secretary Of State. They did the same thing. So all of a sudden when it's one of those women who gets close to the White House then it's okay to trash them.But when it's one of their women, then they try to play the victim card. America is tired of that stuff right now. She should stand on her own two feet. Take the heat. Look, this is for the presidency of the United States. Nobody is going to feel sorry for her. Nobody is going to back down. I'm glad Donald Trump is not handling her with kid gloves.KELLY: Right. Julie, that is true that there was -- Sarah Palin endured a lot of sexism when she was running and the women's groups, I mean, the silence was deafening. They were not there for her, you tell me, because she is a Republican.ROGINSKY: No question and I agree with you 100 percent. Sarah Palin got the short tricks (ph) in many ways.KELLY: So you understand why Republicans are like boohoo, we're not listening to your complaints now. Where were you when one of ours are being attacked.ROGINSKY: First and foremost, some of us were there for Sarah Palin, not specifically on her policies...(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Well those don't help women.ROGINSKY: But some of us did feel that Sarah Palin got incredibly short tripped (ph) especially when you said when people were saying how is she going to balance having children, and she had a newborn.KELLY: And put her on the cover, I think it was of ""Newsweek"" in a portrait she did for a biking magazine.ROGINSKY: Yup, but listen, I'm not sure she should have posed for that, necessarily for that picture...KELLY: Oh, come on.ROGINSKY: ...but having said that, look, I mean there is no question that if you went to the Republican Convention as all of us did and you saw some of the buttons being handed out and you saw some of the things that were said about her, she was called ""B"" word. She was called the ""C"" word. She was called all sorts of names that I've never heard a man being called and you can't say that's anything other than sexism, unfortunately.KELLY: All right. I got to leave it at that. Gave you the last word. Great to see you both.ROGINSKY: Good to see you.KELLY: Still ahead, Senator Harry Reid has taken heat in the past for some wild claims about Republican candidates and critics say he's at it again. Marc Thiessen has an update on that. Plus, new questions tonight about CNN's debate questions and exactly who leaked them to Mrs. Clinton ahead of some of the presidential debates. Former CNN chief Jon Kline is here in a ""Kelly File"" exclusive right after this break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Developing tonight, growing calls for an investigation at CNN after a high profile contributor was a accused of leaking debate questions to the Clinton campaign not once but twice as it turns out. The accusations are aimed at Donna Brazile. She's the current acting DNC chair and a former CNN contributor -- former as of about a couple of days ago. CNN argues the fault is Brazile's and Brazile's alone but that's not good enough for some critics who are arguing that the network's very integrity is on the line. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE CONCHA, THE HILL MEDIA REPORTER: So CNN, and I called for this a couple of weeks ago, I'm going to do it again, needs to absolutely conduct an internal investigation by an outside firm to see where this cancer exists. And it wouldn't be hard to do.CNN is a proud organization. It's been around for 36 years. There are a lot of good journalists there. They don't deserve to be painted with this broad brush, but unless they do an internal investigation, integrity is going to be a big problem for that network unless they show they're taking this seriously.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joe Concha of The Hill.Joining us now in a ""Kelly File"" exclusive, Jon Klein, the former president of CNN/US and current CEO of TAPP media. Jon, great to see you.JON KLEIN, CEO, TAPP MEDIA: Nice to be here.KELLY: Thanks for being here. So, what about that, because CNN has not said in any way that it's conducting an investigation. In fact, what they seem to be intimating is we don't need to. We think we know what happened and we're okay with our people's behavior. But the American people may not be okay with the behavior.KLEIN: Well, I think CNN has come to the conclusions they have because they've done an investigation. And they may not want to talk about all of the internal workings, but I can tell you that nothing is taken more seriously within the walls of CNN both when I was there, which is, you know, six years ago and today than issues around the integrity of the place. And they sweat a comma in a report. I mean they have an in-house unit headed by an executive vice president which does nothing but try to anticipate problems or investigate problems...KELLY: If you get a report like this, when we saw the first WikiLeaks disclosure that she said sometimes I get the questions in advance and she forwards the exact, exact -- I mean it's verbatim, the exact question that Roland Martin first proposed asking. He shortened it in the actual debate but what we have on paper is him sending it to CNN saying, here's what I want to ask and it was exactly the same. That's got to be DEFCON 5 at CNN.KLEIN: Oh my God, yeah. I mean, you wouldn't rest until you got to the bottom of that.KELLY: So they clearly think that Roland Martin did that.KLEIN: Yes they do.KELLY: They've made that pretty clear including journalists like Jake Tapper and others who were involved, and the journalists as is their right and what they should do, is to protect their own integrity and defend it. So then another debate comes out with Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon and it happens again. They seem satisfied that nobody at CNN leaked that one to Donna, that maybe one of the questioners at the town hall leaked it. I haven't seen any proof of that.KLEIN: They think that Donna ran into one of these questioners because she spent the day handing out water in Flint and may have run into somebodyKELLY: Well, that's a possibility but how are we supposed to accept that as fact?KLEIN: Well, they are more worked up about the issue than Joe Concha is. I mean, they have much more at stake than anybody in making sure that their reputation is pristine.KELLY: Right.KLEIN: So, I can only presume that they have run this down to the ends of the earth as far as they're concerned and to their satisfaction and I believe Jeff Zucker when he says he finds it disgusting. I don't think it's surprising when you've got a partisan surrogate in your midst as a paid contributor.KELLY: But you're assuming she's an ethical person.KLEIN: You are...KELLY: That's cheating, what she did.KLEIN: At the end of the day, I hope this can be the death now for the surrogates that all of the news networks employ because it's predictable as a viewer now. I've just been a viewer for six years. It's boring. We know what the Punch and Judy puppets are going to say every time...KELLY: Yes, but you also know...KLEIN: ...maybe there can be a fresh start.KELLY: And I know this is the case at CNN too because I (inaudible) a lot of those guys. That debate room is in violet, nobody can get in. Leaks would be unthinkable. And so, the problem is something did happen in this circumstance and you're not anticipating that Donna Brazile is somehow going to get her hands on your question and leak it. So, I don't -- you know, you tell me how -- why CNN should have anticipated that.KLEIN: Oh, I think that...KELLY: That's why we just have to fire the partisans as a result.KLEIN: I think at the end of the day, you know where people's loyalties ultimately lie. And they don't lie ultimately...KELLY: Yeah, but just because they're loyal in this case the Democrats, doesn't make you a cheater. She cheated.KLEIN: I'm sure that under pressure she felt that she had something that could be helpful to the person or the cause that she is most...KELLY: I'm sure she did.KLEIN: By the way, she leaked this to the Hillary camp during the primaries. We don't know that she did not leak things to Sanders. WikiLeaks...KELLY: I think we can intimate (ph)...KLEIN: Only because WikiLeaks has spoon fed us the Hillary stuff. Is there Sanders' stuff, we don't know.KELLY: I haven't heard from the Sanders' people on this, but perhaps they've got some enormous secret that they're keeping. But the other question is how many other questions were leaked? We only have a little snippet, and so -- what if Jo Concha's suggestion and that of others that they need an outside investigator to come in CNN so we can trust CNN so we don't have to worry. So the journalists can say, look, outside investigator said it wasn't us.KLEIN: I think if you're CNN you're saying we've got great internal mechanisms. If this story dies down, we don't need to have long drawn out internal investigation. That's just going to create more headlines and more doubt. We're satisfied. The proof will be are there no more leaks.KELLY: Jon Klein, great to see you.KLEIN: You too.KELLY: Still ahead, Harry Reid, foot in the mouth, again. Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. HARRY REID, D-NEV., MAJORITY LEADER: So, the word is out that he hasn't paid any taxes for 10 years. Let him prove that he has paid taxes because he hasn't.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: That was Senator Harry Reid in 2012 making claims about Mitt Romney which were completely made up. In fact, here's how Senator Reid -- Senator Reid responded when he finally got called out on his dishonesty almost three years later.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: So no regrets about Mitt Romney, about the Koch brothers. Some people have even called it McCarthyite.REID: Well, they can call it whatever they want. Romney didn't win, did he?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: He's a charmer. Now critics say Senator Reid is at it again, this time alleging coordination between Trump and the Russians, suggesting the FBI has explosive information that must be made public. Joining us now, American Enterprise Institute scholar and fox news contributor, Marc Thiessen. Marc, well who in their right mind would doubt the man.MARCH THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Of course, you know, I mean. Look, Harry Reid is an unapologetic liar. He went on national television and was confronted with the fact that he had smeared Mitt Romney incorrectly and he didn't care one iota about the fact that he had lied. He said, well he lost, didn't he. He cares that Romney lost, not that he lied. He will say anything. This is a guy -- he's the perfect spokesman for Hillary Clinton. He actually lies so often, he makes Hillary Clinton look like a pair of (inaudible) honesty.KELLY: I think it's not so much that, you know, first I thought its like, what moron would believe that because he lies, and he admits he lies and he doesn't care. But it's not about some random person hearing it, it's about the media saying there's a good idea to spread and then people not -- and then not playing that earlier clip and people walking away saying, oh, okay, I saw it on the news, Trump and Russia are like this.THIESSEN: Yeah, and of course then CNN comes out and reports that they went and talked to the FBI investigators and there is no evidence of the connection between Trump and Russia. So, you know, what Harry Reid said -- oh my gosh, what Harry Reid said is actually not true, surprise, surprise. And this is a guy -- I mean, this is a pattern with him. This is a guy who in 2014, he got his Super PAC, his leadership PAC got a dozen Pinocchios from the ""Washington Post"" for putting up false ads.KELLY: A dozen?THIESSEN: This is a guy who got -- a dozen, a dozen Pinocchios. It's hard to get a dozen Pinocchios.KELLY: What do they give a triple Pinocchio maximum rating?THIESSEN: For repeated campaign ads, they got four Pinocchios. He also -- he said the Kch brothers were largely responsible for global warming, more Pinocchios. He said that all -- when we were on the air when the Obamacare rollout came out, talking about the stories of people who were losing their health insurance, he went on the senator floor, all lies. I mean he is a serial liar. And so you know, this guys is going to go back to the Senate, and look, he says things like the word is out. What does the word is out mean? I mean, we talked about this when he said that about Mitt Romney. I could say anything. I could say Harry Reid beats his wife, the word is out. I have no proof but hey, you know, let him prove that I'm wrong. Harry Reid is taking money from the mob, word is out. I have no proof but go ahead, you know, prove me wrong Harry Reid. You can say anything about politics when you do that.KELLY: Harry Reid is the illegitimate son of Geppetto, the word is out.THIESSEN: That is true.KELLY: Marc, good to see you.THIESSEN: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: We'll be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: And something exciting to tell you. Two weeks from today, my new book, ""Settle For More"" hits bookstores across the U.S. Yes, this is the first I've held it. The thing has been secret for months and months and months. This is the only copy, Sean. This is it. He wants to know what's in it. Just a little peak.SEAN HANNITY, HOST, ""HANNITY"": Great. I can't wait to read the O'Reilly chapter.KELLY: Stand by. You'll love it because -- The O'Reilly chapter, and you're in there too.HANNITY: Uh oh.KELLY: If you are sick of the cupcake nation we live in, if you're sick of helicopters parents, the safe spaces, and syphoning  of free speech we're seeing in America, you'll love it. And if you would like to hear about how a kid who grew up in upstate New York, the daughter of middle class parents, wound up right here at the Fox News Channel, number one, Fox News...HANNITY: You grew up in Albany, right?KELLY: Yes.HANNITY: That's so awesome.KELLY: Albany and Syracuse with no money and now look at us, Sean, working with such great people like the man on the other side of this camera.HANNITY: Listen, I'm way overpaid.KELLY: OK pipe down, I'm selling my book. It's all in there. I get deeply personal in it about my family, my life, some tough times I had on the way to my current life and I hope -- I hope maybe it will inspire some of you who may be feeling unhappy to think about how you can settle for more too.
