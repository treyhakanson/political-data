They convinced themselves it was the right thing to do, the thing they had to do.""Well, Polish Leaders were not happy about being included in that list. The prime minister called the comments unacceptable.The U.S. ambassador to Poland was summoned to a meeting with Polish leaders who demanded an apology.The ambassador's response was quite clear. Quote -- ""Nazi Germany alone bears responsibility.""The state department doubled down on walking the comments back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARIE HARF, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: Director Comey certainly did not intend to suggest otherwise, did not intend to suggest that Poland was in some way responsible for the Holocaust.(END VIDEO CLIP)Harf would not, however, say if Comey should or would apologize.Con AirAn inspector general's audit of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) prison transfer flights finds the department could save more than $41 million by filling up its planes.ICE-Air transferred almost a million detainees over a three year period.But the report recommends what airlines already know -- fill up the seats, drive down the costs.ICE disagrees with using empty seats being a measure of efficiency.It says delaying the removal of individuals could wind up costing more in the long run.But, the agency says it will try to make sure its resources are effectively used.Final JabFinally, one last political swipe from beyond the grave in a North Carolina man's obituary.Quote -- ""The family respectfully asks that you do not vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: I'm Greg Gutfeld. A huge night for Hillary Clinton, very soon she will officially become her party's nominee. Chief political anchor, Bret Baier, my favorite bear, joins us now to tell us what's about to happen. Bret?BRET BAIER, CHIEF POLITICAL ANCHOR: Hi, Greg, and everybody on ""The Five,"" we are here in the hall and they just started the nominating speeches, and you get a sense from the crowd. There are a lot of Bernie delegates down there. They are going to start the roll call after a short time, but you've been hearing Bernie Sanders' chants and clapping. Right now you had Tulsi Gabbard, who just left, she was the first nominating speech for Bernie Sanders, she remembered as one of the first people in Congress to endorse Sanders. Right now you have Paul Feeney, he is the Bernie 2016 Massachusetts State Director and then one more nominating speech was added for Bernie Sanders, Shyla Nelson, a delegate from Vermont. You'll then have nominating speeches for Hillary Clinton that will include Barbara Mikulski, senator from Maryland and also John Lewis, the long-time representative from Georgia.At that point, the roll call will start. We're told that it will go alphabetically, state, all the states. Vermont will pass. And as of this late hour, it was still being negotiated how it was all going to wrap up. Hillary Clinton needs 2,382 delegates to get over the hump to officially become the nominee. She will get that probably around South Dakota or Tennessee. But in the end, all the states will be counted. And we're told Bernie Sanders may even come down and ask for acclimation, that all of the delegates then go to Hillary Clinton, but we don't know if that's a fact or not. We do know that there's a lot of chanting in this hall for Bernie Sanders and expect that to continue throughout this hour. Back to you guys.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: A well like Max Baer (ph).BAIER: This sort are right (ph).GUTFELD: Thanks, Bret.So last night, Bernie threw his supporters under his very own bus.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This election is about which candidate understands the real problems facing this country and has offered real solutions.Based on her ideas and her leadership, Hillary Clinton must become the next president of the United States.Hillary Clinton will make an outstanding president and I am proud to stand with her tonight.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: And of course, sadness ensued.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SANDERS: Transform America, and that revolution --CROWD: (shouting)SANDERS: Thank you very much.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Poor thing. But she has no reason to be distraught. She got what she wanted. Sure, it's not Bernie, but it's not Hillary either. It's a ""Hernie,"" a fusion of both.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Oh my, God.GUTFELD: Guilty of cultural appropriation, Hernie is Hillary aping Bernie, embracing a progressive platform that's now 90 percent more progressive. It's left-wing Raisin Bran with two extra scoops of socialism. Trashing evil banks, free trade, corporations and small businesses while expanding the size and scope of big government, Hernie has created a road map to success, found on spectacular display right now in Venezuela.So this is not Bill Clinton's Democratic Party. It's not even a Democratic Party. It's now a slab of left-wing populism, democratic socialism and vile identity politics. Sanders endorses it, because he helped build this grim repudiation of the most successful system in history, and Hillary is fine with it, as is sad comic Sarah Silverman who relied on tired old jokes, and I don't mean Al Franken.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SARAH SILVERMAN, COMEDIAN: Hillary heard the passion of the people. The people behind Bernie, and I will proudly vote for her.Just a few years ago, she was a secretary and now she's going to be president. Can I just say to the Bernie or bust people -- you're being ridiculous.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: So she's calling them ridiculous? That's like Big Bird calling someone yellow and feathery.So congratulations to Bernie, to realize his socialist dreams, he didn't have to move to Cuba. He moved Cuba here.All right. So, Juan, you've made this point before. Hillary is moving left to get Bernie's people. But this is an act, right? She's going to move right back.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: I don't know. I mean, it seems to me Bernie promises that this is a movement that it's not a one-time thing, and he has had success. The thing that struck me yesterday, Greg was at the -- his troops managed to change a super delegates' rule. You know everybody is so upset .GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: . about super delegates all going to Hillary. They've changed that now. They had a compromise forced by the Bernie people. But you know, when I was listening to you, I was thinking about how many of the democrats now say they have no problem with socialist.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: I'm a little surprised at it.GUTFELD: Me, too.WILLIAMS: And of course the millennials, or mainly democrats, they are not, they really want government intervention in terms of like lower costs for tuition, healthcare, the minimum wage.GUTFELD: Mommy and daddy as government.WILLIAMS: Well, if that's what you take it to me. That's what, that's who they are.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: That's who this younger generation .GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: . of democrats is at this moment.GUTFELD: Yeah. It's a sad thing, Eric. What did you make of the speech?ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: So, here is what I made of the night.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: It started out on a really, really shaky beginning and it got worse until Michelle Obama spoke. And then she kind of put a calming tone on things. I think it's a terrible start for the, for the DNC. They should have fixed this before they got to this point. I thought it was very important what Bernie said, ""Even though we didn't win, we have enough voice on the platform committee that they got the most .""GUTFELD: Right.BOLLING: "". progressive, socialistic, loving agenda in the history of democrat politics and everyone should be, should be worried about that."" One final note -- and I think this is something the Trump campaign should pick up on. I'm not sure they're even thinking about this yet. Bernie Sanders started speaking at 10:50 last night, I believe.(CROSSTALK)DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Yeah, about that.BOLLING: And he spoke until about 11:23 to 25. The networks were supposed to stop at 11:00. So there are 23 or 25 minutes additional time, and I'm guessing tonight the same things will be going to happen with Bill Clinton, he'll go over time as well. If Trump were smart, he would be doing the math on all this and having people -- you have seven days to apply for equal time and the networks have to make up that equal time to his campaign as well, and they -- he should take that.GUTFELD: Interesting.GUILFOYLE: Hmm.GUTFELD: Hmm. Dana, do you think that Sanders -- I see Sanders getting a role in this administration, as like the head of the DMV.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Because I could see him just getting --PERINO: Because they will make the DMV work so much better?GUTFELD: Yeah, but he could just be --PERINO: But that-- there's not a federal DMV.GUTFELD: I would -- no. It is expanding government create the department of the DMV.PERINO: That's not a good idea.GUTFELD: The department of the department.PERINO: I think that's, you mean, I'll give him a job where he's never seen again?GUTFELD: Exactly.PERINO: I don't think he'll take it.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: I think he does like the spotlight. He earned the spotlight last night. I mean, there are obvious -- that's genuine affection and emotion that they were feeling for him. But I also thought that -- I didn't think the Sarah Silverman thing was ridiculous when she said to them, ""To the Bernie or bust people, you're being ridiculous."" I felt like that helped break the fever, the Bernie people.GUTFELD: But wasn't it already breaking? It was dissipating, I thought, and kind like --BOLLING: By the way, it just came awesome -- Bernie fever.PERINO: I know. That's what I was saying.GUTFELD: Wow.GUILFOYLE: Just cute.BOLLING: Bernie fever.GUTFELD: I got that once in the tropics.GUILFOYLE: Bernie fever.GUTFELD: Oh, it was horrible. All of them, I bet.PERINO: That rash was unbelievable.GUTFELD: Yeah. It was shaped like Texas.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: And it felt like Texas, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Somebody call 911, more ointment for Greg, yeah?GUTFELD: Yes. Did he do the right thing?GUILFOYLE: You know, he did, because I think there was a tremendous amount of pressure for him to bring the party together. And he still is a big winner in all this, like Dana has mentioned, and Bolling, because he still has a platform. He has the leverage. He has a big movement and ground swell behind him. When you see that raw emotion on the faces of his followers, they are all in on him. And those are people that can continue to follow him going forward, that help him to have a larger voice in the party. Now, if you're on the other side and you're republican, pay attention to that, because, also, the fact remains that Bernie Sanders is going to exercise considerable influence. And some of that will be in the form of the platform and what kind of money will be spent on progressive programs and which also goes into whether or not the debt can increase and how we are going to pay for it. And then there's our friend called basic math that has to be taken into consideration.PERINO: Yeah, that's what I'm going to say. It's not -- I don't think it's good. It might have been good for Bernie. I don't think it's necessarily good for the democrats. I don't think the country has moved that far left.GUILFOYLE: Yup.PERINO: And I think that puts the republicans in a position to be able to hold on and maybe even win the presidency this year. It's not good for America that the laws of economics, the theories of economics are not going to change just because there are disaffected young people.GUTFELD: Right. That is true.PERINO: All right.GUTFELD: And I agree with you.WILLIAMS: But I think, you know what, so last week, we were all talking about Ted Cruz.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: So he finished second on the republican side, and what did he do? He didn't endorse. So last night we have Bernie finishing second on the democratic side. His passionate supporters .PERINO: Good point.WILLIAMS: . was crying and carrying on, much like remember Monday night at the republicans where the republicans under Cruz tried to stage their own coup. So last night, I think we had a similar event here, but Bernie handled a little differently. And I would say, I like what Sarah Silverman say.PERINO: I do.WILLIAMS: Basically, I think these people were behaving like juveniles.BOLLING: Yeah.WILLIAMS: They never heard of compromise.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: They saw an election, a primary election taken away from them, stolen from them.WILLIAMS: Oh, come on. They lost --BOLLING: They kind (inaudible).WILLIAMS: Hillary got more votes.BOLLING: So on the left, and you guys made a lot of hay out of the boos that Ted Cruz .WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: . didn't endorse Donald Trump.WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: It's the same thing, all night, remember?WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: That night and going into that the next morning, until some other scandal happened, whatever it was. I can't remember.WILLIAMS: That's right.BOLLING: But tonight, I think you're going to get more boos. I think --GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: As he's nominated, I think you gonna get boos. I think when Vermont votes, you're going to get boos. You're going to get Hillary boos all night. So it may go on a little bit longer than just one event at the RNC .PERINO: Btu I think --BOLLING: ... that you thought was big.WILLIAMS: Oh, I don't. I just don't see the boos coming, that's like -- I think what they are been doing all day is negotiating, because they see, they should.BOLLING: Negotiating the boos?WILLIAMS: No. They're negotiating to have Bernie play a key role in this .PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: . nominating process, so that his folks won't boo.GUTFELD: Do you know who is going to get a lot of boos tonight?BOLLING: You.GUTFELD: Me.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Exactly.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Mini bar, the mini bar like there's nothing in the mini bar.PERINO: It's like -- why do they have a refrigerator with nothing in it?GUILFOYLE: No, it's empty and that was a big debate over whether the bottle of Pinot Noir that you love is free or not. Someone let us know. Did they comp that?GUTFELD: Well, I left something in that fridge. More to come .(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: . to night one of the DNC ahead. Plus, a special guest is going to join us, a man who helped President Obama defeat Hillary Clinton back in 2008 -- David Plouffe. Is that how you say it?PERINO: Plouffe.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: What a Plouffe. We get his thoughts on the convention. I wanted to meet him before and talk to him. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: This is a Fox News alert. We are moments away from the roll call of the states who officially nominate Hillary Clinton for president. Let's go live to Fox News James Rosen on the convention floor. James?JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, guys. For all the fact that is gonna be when Hillary Clinton is nominated for the presidency. This, in some ways is shaping up as Bernie Sanders' convention. He's getting huge applause. We just saw him waving from a VIP box to the crowd and just getting a tremendous reception. But for the Sanders forces, it sort of like they were denied a steak dinner at Morton's and now they are running through the candy store and trying to grab all the Jolly Ranchers and Tootsie Rolls they can. What is that mean? Some kind of a role for him tonight, there's been negotiations all day. And the latest we're hearing is that it may be Senator Sanders, who after Hillary Clinton secures the 2,382 votes she needs in this roll call coming up. Who will be the individual who moves that Hillary Clinton's nomination should be by acclimation? It's unclear whether he will do that from the Vermont, a delegation where he resides. So much is up in the air, but this is a fired-up crowd and it's amazing to watch the Hillary supporters waving their, ""do the most good"" signs. And the Sanders crowd is responding tremendously to their candidate who they see as wronged in this entire process. Back to you guys.GUILFOYLE: All right, thanks James. Now, despite the theme of united together, the Democratic National Convention was torn apart yesterday. The First Lady, Michelle Obama brought a divided audience together for a little while when she took the stage and fired them up against Donald Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHELLE OBAMA, UNITED STATES FIRST LADY: Don't let anyone ever tell you that this country isn't great. That somehow we need to make it great again. I want someone with the proven strength to persevere, someone who understands that the issues the president faces as are not black and white and cannot be boiled down to 140 characters, because when --(APPLAUSE)M. OBAMA: When you have the nuclear codes at your fingertips and the military in your command, you can't make snap decisions. You can't have a thin skin or tendency to lash out.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: OK. Everybody has got something to say about this topic. Greg, I was going to Dana and you started jumping up and down.GUTFELD: Well, OK.GUILFOYLE: What is the urgency?GUTFELD: ""Don't let anyone ever tell you this country isn't great.""She should have added, unless it's me, Michelle Obama, because eight years ago, I said for the first time I'm proud of this country. I'm glad that she said this. That she said the United States is the greatest country on earth, but it took her eight years. But I'm welcome, welcome to the rest of us who love this country.GUILFOYLE: OK, open your shirt again, because you're with her, too.GUTFELD: Yes.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: She would win.GUILFOYLE: This is such a great point. You know, Dana, I was watching this and say, wow. She looks, she sounds presidential. She was beloved by the crowd. She really did deliver a great speech. It was the highlight, as Eric said as well, of yesterday.PERINO: What -- I think, what a remarkable eight years and she is a woman that will play an important role in our history, forever. And you know, when she said what she said on the campaign trail in 2008, you knew that it was Laura Bush, who after eight years -- actually sent a letter to Michelle Obama that said, ""I know you didn't mean that how it came out."" And she gave basically an olive branch to Michelle Obama that said, ""It's going to be OK. You're going to come under a lot of scrutiny."" So I think that last night was, by far and away, one of Michelle Obama's best nights. She's a net plus for the democrats, but certainly, she looks like she's glad that it's coming to an end. She's going to be glad to have her family out of the White House, I think. I think that she has maybe experienced something that she wants to share with the American people, which is that she really love this is country and she wishes maybe that she could have taken those words back.GUILFOYLE: I'm quite certain. But, yes, she has done a dedicated service to this country like first ladies do. Eric, she was a standout. And I imagine at the end of this convention, we will still say the same thing that she was a standout candidate. And I wouldn't be surprised if we saw her running in the future after a bit of time passes.BOLLING: No idea about that, but I will tell you like I said earlier, there were boos throughout the evening every time Hillary Clinton's name was mentioned. The boo crew got involved even when Bernie Sanders spoke. He was actually booed when he mentioned Hillary Clinton. So I think that will, again, happen tonight. Michelle Obama did kind of put an end to that for the evening, which was good. And I agree, I think her speech was fantastic, but -- hey, she did --GUILFOYLE: She looks great, too.BOLLING: She had eight years to .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: . get ready for it. And she delivered it nicely.GUILFOYLE: Well.BOLLING: Again, no mention of ISIS all night, no mention of Islamic terror all night -- maybe, maybe not. No American flags. A lot of people were saying, ""We couldn't see one."" I saw one kind of flying above in one of the, you know, one of the video monitors, but I didn't see one fit --GUTFELD: It might have been a Mexican flag.BOLLING: And there may have been some of that, but there are a lot of references to black lives matter. And for me, this, that was not the time or place to be doing it. And I agree that we have a lot more tonight, so.GUILFOYLE: Juan, how did you see things last night?WILLIAMS: Well, I thought Michelle Obama gave the best speech we heard in 2016, either convention so far. We'll see what comes, but that was a pretty amazing performance. I thought it was well-written. I -- in fact, the same woman who wrote that speech is the one who wrote the 2008 speech that was plagiarized. And she also wrote for Mrs. Clinton, when Mrs. Clinton has that line about, you know, thousand of cracks in the glass ceiling. So, great speech and very well delivered. She did not mention Donald Trump by name, but I think effectively spoke to people about what your children are hearing on TV and what they experience in terms of bullying and, you know, name calling, and we want that as a model for our children. By talking about her children, she went above politics in a very effective way and said it's not about republican and democrat. It's about us as an American people and got through -- got through the .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: . polarizing static that so attended in all our politics today.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: One thing I would add is that the 2016 Senate and House races, the ones that are especially close, and gubernatorial races, I would imagine that Michelle's dance card is really filling up because she will be an effective surrogate for them. Sometimes first ladies don't get involved that much in campaigns, but I have a feeling that she will pick and choose and be very effective in the places that she chooses to go to for fund- raising and for getting out to vote.GUILFOYLE: And she's been very popular. And I will say her detail does like her quite a lot. That's like I heard secret service detail.GUTFELD: One interesting point to make, they don't mention Trump and they don't mention ISIS. So clearly, they think of them in the same boat.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Well, she didn't. Trump was mentioned 83 times last --WILLIAMS: Yeah, a lot.PERINO: But who is counting?BOLLING: Yeah. More, I think more than Hillary Clinton was mentioned at the --GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Yeah, but you know what the biggest surprise was to me at (inaudible)? Not mention of God.GUTFELD: Hmm.BOLLING: Well, God.PERINO: Yup.BOLLING: You know, under God, I think the pledge of allegiance.GUTFELD: You mean Russian (ph).(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: I'm saying, I never heard at a convention was --GUILFOYLE: Does that was --WILLIAMS: About God.GUILFOYLE: All right. Oh, that was a little shout out for us. All right. Ahead, Former Obama Campaign Adviser David Plouffe is going to join us for his very first appearance on ""The Five."" We're looking forward to talking to him about this convention. Stay right there.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: OK, the 2016 democrat roll call is now under way. We're now going to throw it back to Bret, who is at the scene. I believe it's Alaska voting. Go ahead, Bret.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CASEY STEINAU, CHAIR OF THE ALASKA DEMOCRATIC PARTY: . the most diverse national -- I'm sorry, native population in the United States with 229 federally registered -- recognized tribes. Alaska, which makes United States an arctic nation, casts six votes for the next president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and 14 votes for the inspiring progressive Bernie Sanders.(APPLAUSE)STEPHANIE RAWLINGS-BLAKE, BALTIMORE MAYOR: Alaska, you have cast six votes for Secretary Clinton and 14 votes for Senator Sanders.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right, we are watching the roll call vote, it's underway. That was Alaska. And we're going to go back to Bret when he's ready, when we have a second. In the meantime, you see it Kimberly, you've said Jennifer Griffin just told us that there are some flags on stage. Is that right?GUILFOYLE: Yes. So we love him. Jennifer Griffin is, in fact, watching ""The Five.BOLLING: Right.GUILFOYLE: ... and Fox. So she said there are number of American flags on stage and in the backdrop, but we can't see those. We're happy to hear it.BOLLING: That's very good news. Our thoughts on the roll call vote and finally 2016 --PERINO: Well, I think what you just heard as just now, Eric, that there should be, you know, a lot of Bernie supporters still in there and they're kind of being jerks, right? Because he's not going to get it, she will be the nominee and I think Sarah Silverman was right. That they are being ridiculous, but I think that they're embracing their ridiculousness and they are going to keep it going. It's like, who knows a party atmosphere. There's nothing that's going to stop it. Maybe Barack Obama will be able to calm them down tomorrow night.BOLLING: Greg, Dana coined, did she coin the phrase, Bernie fever? --PERINO: I don't know.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: I was curious what the woman -- from anchorage what was going say. And I thought, I don't know. Alaska.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Oh my, God.BOLLING: In the Bernie voice --GUILFOYLE: I know.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Is it Juan, maybe laughing about Greg.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: I like, I like that. I'll ask her. I think that's --GUTFELD: It's the worst joke ever.WILLIAMS: Well, I liked it.GUTFELD: Eric.WILLIAMS: But anyway, you know what strikes me is that, I thought Elizabeth Warren. You guys mentioned maybe Barack Obama tomorrow night, maybe, you know, what Sanders had to say yesterday would have calmed them down, but I thought Elizabeth Warren was going to be a major player, but coming right after Michelle Obama, before Bernie Sanders, I mean like --GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Did she talk? Did she speak? I forget. What did she say? You know.PERINO: Are you kidding me? She talked for a really long time.GUILFOYLE: It wasn't very compelling, though, or charismatic. I think Michelle Obama or not, if you're --PERINO: It was a solidly written speech.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, but it just wasn't delivered with much panache.GUTFELD: You know what? It reminded me of a substitute teacher trying to explain American imperialism to bored fifth graders. I was thinking like just enough already, trying to stay awake.PERINO: Is there gonna there be a test?GUTFELD: Yeah, there would. No, because she'll be gone by the end of the day.WILLIAMS: So what did you think of her principle attack on Trump, which was, here's a guy who says that he knows how to build things, but he doesn't pay his carpenters. He doesn't pay his plumbers, instead he says, ""Go to court if you think you can get your money."" What do you think of that?PERINO: I think that was a preview of what's to come as part of the attacks on Donald Trump from the democrats in the next 90 days.WILLIAMS: I think so.GUTFELD: But he -- did you see what he said today?WILLIAMS: No, tell me.GUTFELD: On the heels of that -- this is what Donald Trump does. You -- there's complaints about Donald Trump in that vain, that he doesn't pay his bills. Today he said, you know what, the air conditioning in the hall at one of his venues wasn't working well enough or he's saying -- suggesting that maybe they shouldn't have paid the bill because it wasn't working. And so he takes whatever you would think would be a negative and turns it around into, I'm embracing this. I'm going to take it one step further.WILLIAMS: Well, here's the other part of it that's coming out today. Whether or not Donald Trump, you know, had some involvement with the Russians, right? And, in fact, George Will is arguing maybe we're not seeing his tax returns because ...BOLLING: Yeah.WILLIAMS: ... business with Russia ...BOLLING: That's actually because -- Assange today said there's absolutely no ties with the Russians as far as he knows with the leaked e-mails that they got and then exposed.WILLIAMS: How about the Chinese then?GUTFELD: Russians are everywhere Eric, they're so old school, it's like they do everything that we wish we could do.BOLLING: You made a very good point yesterday. I'm not sure -- I think it was even at the bar last night that -- Wikileaks -- they're not the hackers. They're just leaking things that hackers give to them.GUILFOYLE: Information acquisition and then they give the documents to them.BOLLING: Stephanie Rawlings-Blake is overseeing, chairing this roll call vote. No pushback on that, no controversy there?WILLIAMS: No. In fact, you know, there was some booing yesterday when you had Marcia Fudge, the congresswoman from Ohio and others trying to get things going. But no, I mean, I know you guys don't like Stephanie Rawlings-Blake because of her role during the rioting.GUILFOYLE: Well and the destruction of public property, the destruction of small businesses and people in that community trying to make a living for their community and trying to serve those around them. I mean it's a real direct economic blow to the prosperity of a community. And there's really never a good time, it's never appropriate to call for lawlessness and physical violence and destruction of property.WILLIAMS: Look, I agree with you. But I'm just saying no backlash yesterday against her here in the Democrat.GUTFELD: There's no state that begins with the letter ""B"", is there?BOLLING: That's unfortunate. But it is interesting that you go right to that big state, California, 551 votes, delegates in California.All right, we're going to go. Right up next, former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe is here. We'll be right back with him.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ... for Bernie Sanders, 221 votes. And for Hillary Clinton, the next president of the United States, 330 votes.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: All right. We're back now on ""The Five"" and the roll call to nominate Hillary Clinton to be the Democratic nominee is underway. And Bret Baier is over in the arena, checking it out for us. Bring us up to speed, Bret. How is it going?BAIER,HOST: All right Dana first of all, can you hear and see me, that's all good?PERINO: Yes.BAIER: Delaware is underway. The roll call vote is now happening, each one of the states making a pitch for their state and then saying exactly how the delegate breakdown happens between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. There is only one thing that the Democrats have to do this week and that is formally nominate a candidate for president.Hillary Clinton will be that candidate once she crosses over the threshold of 2,382 delegates. You can see on the bottom of the screen the tally underway, each state, each territory adding up. But this is a little different. Sometimes they rig it so that the home state can get them over the number. But they're going to go through all of the states alphabetically and we're told that Bernie Sanders is on the move. He has moved from the VIP box to sit down with the Vermont delegates and they are going to pass, we're told.And then at the end of the entire vote, Bernie Sanders is going to make a pitch to have all the delegates by acclimation go to Hillary Clinton in an effort, sign and signal in this contentious first couple of days of unity for Democrats. I will tell you that there have been a lot of cheers and clapping for Bernie Sanders and a lot of signs on the floor here. But they're methodically going through each state and territory. Back to you.PERINO: All right Bret, thank you so much. And we've got a special guest here with us now, David Plouffe, who managed President Obama's successful campaign in 2008, he also lead the effort to reelect the president in 2012 and served as senior adviser to President Obama in the white house.He is currently Chief Policy Adviser to Uber and a member of its directors. David, thank you so much for being here. ""The Five"" has a lot of topics and want to ask you a ton of questions. I'll kick it off and then we'll go around the table and we'll keep you around for another one.On June 29th you tweeted something that I paid attention to, you said this race is not close and it won't be on November 8th. You predicted 350 plus electoral votes for Clinton. You still stand by that?DAVID PLOUFFE, PRESIDENT OBAMA CAMPAIGN MANAGER: I do. Although I thought nobody paid attention any our (ph). I do, for this reason, I mean you see polls. Poll are increasingly flowed. The question is you have to allocate out 100 percent of the vote that you think is going to occur on Election Day, have some sort of what the turnout variance is, and particularly look at the battleground states.So, you know, presidential races tend to be close, we won by seven in '08, four in 2012. This could be a close race but, you know, is Donald Trump going to win Nevada, Florida, Virginia, Ohio? Even if polls show it close right now, on Election Day I have a hard time seeing that's going to happen. A bunch of things would have to happen, historically bad Democratic turnout, historically good Republican turnout and he would have to win the moderate vote which is the path to presidency. And I just don't see that happening.PERINO: And what do you look at that maybe differently to what something that any of us look at? Is there something you pay attention to that we should be looking at?PLOUFFE: Well, the benefit -- I'm not in a campaign right now. I've got a day job. But, campaigns have all the data. You know, you have a sense of how every voter has behaved, is likely to behave. And when you model that out and you look at what a presidential election is likely to look like. Now, the truth is, this was a winnable race for the right Republican candidate. I just don't think Donald Trump is that candidate because my strong suspicion is Hillary Clinton will get a higher percentage of the Democratic vote than Trump gets with the republican vote and I think she's going to moderate vote.Even though moderates right now are not sure if either choice, they ultimately have to make a choice. And so I think, you know, President Obama won the White House largely because he won the moderate vote twice. President Bush did that twice as well.PERINO: All right, let's go down this way. Eric, let's start with you.BOLLING: So, David, you're in a unique position to have spent a lot of time at high levels of politics and also a lot of time or some amount of time at high levels of business. Don't you think Donald Trump's business experience is unique and also will help him be a better president?PLOUFFE: Well, for instance, I think Mitt Romney had a much better claim to being someone who understood the economy. We took issue with many parts of it because it's different running a successful business and being president. No. I mean Trump, maybe he's not a fraud, but this is not someone who has built a traditional business. He is a great marketer. Obviously, whether it's Trump University, some of the other efforts, there's been a lot of reports about how he has treated the people who work for him.So, what I would say from a political standpoint what I thought was very surprising last week, and in the whole Trump campaign, if he's not out there saying here are the five ways I'm going to create jobs and the five ways I'm going create wages, I don't think the Democratic Obama way has been the right way. Actually I don't think the Republican way has been right either.I've got kind of a new approach to the economy. His economic message, I think has been lacking. I do think people would listen to the right economic message from someone like Trump. He just hasn't offered it, to me that malpractice.BOLLING: Has she?PLOUFFE: I think she's offered a stronger one. I think she has to offer a stronger one on Thursday. To me what I want to come out of Thursday as a Democrat is one, people being as passionate as electing her as defeating Donald Trump on the Democratic side, and secondly, cheer as a bell what she's going to do to try and help middle-class families.So no, I think she's got answer to that mail.PERINO: They're squeezing me for time Juan, Kimberly, so we'll do a quick one and then we're going to keep you for one more block. So Juan?WILLIAMS: Well, I just, you know, so it's so unusual for me to have someone else who's not a right-winger on this set, so welcome. But, a lot of contention here on the set about the mothers' movement and the fact that she's going to have the mothers of black men killed by police on the set and the response that I get from my colleagues here is, ""Wait. Why don't we have the mothers of policemen who were slain also here at the convention?""PLOUFFE: Well, listen, I think at the end of the day, you're going to hear a lot about security a little bit different than I think you heard in Cleveland. Which I think it was -- you know, there are elements of it that were strong. But generally a pretty dark view of America. We can argue whether it was the right view of America. I don't think that's how most Americans view it. But I think it's very important for the Democratic Party to lay out how they intend to keep the American people save, at a time when people are worried, obviously.But I think what Trump laid out was basically the darkest view of America we've heard in modern times, and as many challenges as we have. You compare that to President Bush. President Reagan. That is not the Republican Party that we historically have seen. There was very little optimism -- and also a narcissistic exercise.WILLIAMS: Are the Democrats antagonizing people who are strongly pro- police?PLOUFFE: I don't think so. I mean if you look what President Obama said - - secretary, I don't know what she's going to say in her speech Thursday, but I don't.PERINO: Do a quick one K.G.GUILFOYLE: I was just going to say, what would you really recommend to the Clinton campaign to kind of bridge this enthusiasm gap, there seems to be a lot more energy and excitement about Bernie Sanders than Hillary.PLOUFFE: Well I think -- well first of all, that's, you know, there's activists and then there's the electorate at large. And you want both of them engaged. I think we need -- I think last night helped. I thin the first lady's speech was electrifying and unifying.GUILFOYLE: We all agree.PLOUFFE: I think her husband will do that tonight, President Obama. So we have an opportunity, we have four nights, not basically a four-hour television show. You need to put on a good show so that people -- I think we're going to come out unified again. She's going to get 93-94 percent of the Democratic vote. The trick is, how much of it turns out and how many people volunteer and that's what she has to do on ThursdayRight now more Democrats are focused on defeating Trump than electing her, we have to see that script book.PERINO: Another one really quick.GUTFELD: I was just wondering, you were late and I was wondering if it was because Uber?PERINO: We are going to keep him for another block.PLOUFFE: Seamless experience.PERINO: All right, much more to come on the ""The Five."" David stays with us, we'll be right back.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ... votes for the next president of the United States Secretary Hillary Clinton.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: We're taking a look right now. The roll call vote is going on at the convention center on the floor right there. And you can see -- we're going to keep our eye on 2,382 delegates, that's the number needed for Hillary Clinton to officially gain the nomination. In the meantime back here, tens of thousands of Americans are descending on Philadelphia this week for the DNC, and lucky for them and us, the city reached a deal with Uber to help them get around town.The (inaudible) is now allowed to operate in the city through the summer to help mitigate transit nightmares. Now David Plouffe is here, Uber's Chief Policy Adviser. He's still with us. David, here is my problem with Democrats, you've been involved -- you're a Democrat who now Senior Adviser to Uber. Why only this summer? A good idea is a good idea.PLOUFFE: Right. Well, you know, I will tell you that the parking authority here that we've had trouble with is Republican dominated.You know we try to get -- no, no, the mayor? Well no, in this case I've learned a lot about local government and local transportation more than I would ever like to know. You know in Florida we tried to get state wide regulations blocked by Republican state senator president because his lifelong friends were the biggest cab owners. So, we've had issues on both sides, but generally, the trajectory is broad agreement, acceptance, new regulations.Why? It's been a new source of real work for a lot of people. Most of our drivers do this a few hours a week to supplement traditional work, so they have more economic security. And think about the reduction of drunk driving, kids under 25 in urban areas don't even think about driving drunk anymore and there's transportation deserts all over the country. Suburban areas and poor areas, and now you press a button in Compton, you get the same ride as you do in Beverly Hills.BOLLING: And good luck taking that away at the end of the convention. Go ahead Greg.GUTFELD: Yeah, I use the metaphor of the T.V. show ""Taxi,"" which was a classic show. If you remove the worst character, which is Louie De Palma, he was the dispatcher, and once you remove that from the show, all those other employees are free to do whatever they want. They can buy a car, share it with their family. And so when the daughter drives at daytime, the father drives at night. It's amazing.But I've read so many articles in progressive magazines that are critical of this, this revolution. It's a revolution. Is it union backed? Its taxi unions are causing the biggest problem?PLOUFFE: Well it's fascinating. By the way it's sad. When I mention the show ""Taxi,"" with all the young people that work at Uber they look at me like I have horns. They don't know what I'm talking about. So, I would say it was more the taxi companies, most taxi are not unionized, and they want to protect -- you know, no -- listen, no entities ever wants to give up a monopoly. Here's what we're trying to do a better job of, the truth is we're less disruptive and additive.GUTFELD: Right.PLOUFFE: So it's suburban areas, under-served areas, that's the value proposition, right? And so that's been the fight we've been getting. I think as more people understand -- listen, we're a private sector enterprise, we're not a nonprofit or government, but there's a lot of great things happening in cities because of ride sharing. People are saving money, they're saving time, they're getting work, less people dying because of drunk driving.BOLLING: So you're giving us all the reason why it was a great idea but the Democrats in many cities are pushing back.PLOUFFE: Well ...BOLLING: We got time let's go (ph).PLOUFFE: We've had almost 100 new laws passed all around the country. So people are starting to embrace it.GUILFOYLE: Another point being made that was very good, being a former prosecutor, having prosecuted so many drunk driving cases, I can't see how refreshing it is, yes, to see young people knowing they have the opportunity to be able to take an Uber, Mothers Against Drunk Driving also a big proponent of Uber, I'm an Uber VIP customer and I put my son who's nine in an Uber and talk to drivers to be able to get him to some places that he needs to go.I think it's really good. And the families that I talk to, the drivers they say, it's so wonderful for their family to have that independence. They feel like they have their own small business to be able to drive and work as much as they want to, increase their income.PLOUFFE: Well sure and both sides, Democrats and Republicans, this is a place of agreement for decades, its how do you get more flexible work? There's nothing more flexible than having no schedule at all. And you decide when you work and you fit this work around everything else in your life. That has profound impact. You can spend more time with your kids, you get to go to job interviews, you spend time with massive benefits.BOLLING: We want to keep you on, can you stick around a little bit?PLOUFFE: Yeah.BOLLING: Dana and Juan, they got ripped off this block again, in the next block. Next, a look ahead of what's happening tonight at the DNC. David stays with us.Back in a moment.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And with all of that, it is my pleasure to cast ...(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: Hillary Clinton is about to officially be nominated for president. Still with us, former Obama Campaign Adviser, David Plouffe. David, tonight the big ticket, Bill Clinton.But I've got to tell you, Bill Clinton recently on his vegan diet after the heart surgery, he's looked a little fragile, hasn't been as powerful an orator as I'm used to. What should we expect?PLOUFFE: Well as you remember he gave probably the most important speech of the 2012 convention for President Obama. So, he's got the ability to do that. It's fascinating to me. This is going to be challenging, though, he's talking about his wife. So, we'll see.But, he still has enormous credibility with the American people as someone who they trust on the economy, trust on Middle class issues. But I assume it will be a very personal speech. There's no doubt even though Hillary Clinton is well known, she's not known as well as she needs to be. So I think he can fill in some of those gaps.WILLIAMS: Dana?PERINO: I want to ask you about one other thing on Uber. You have 50,000 veterans who are working for Uber now, they're drivers. Can you tell me a little bit about them, are guys -- do you guys try to find them or are veterans finding you?PLOUFFE: No, we are working very hard. We're working with Secretary Gates on this and many former military leaders, because it's a great example. So, most Uber drivers aren't making a career out of this, a lot of them might do it for a few months. You come out of the military. You're not sure what you're going to do next. This is a great way to get back into the community and make some money until you figure out what to do next.PERINO: You never know who you might meet.PLOUFFE: You never know who you might meet, it's a great networking opportunity.PERINO: Right.PLOUFFE: So, and you know, most veterans come home -- the other thing a lot of military spouses are driving as well, when their spouse is deployed. So it's a great way, you know, our goal is to get that up to 100,000 and we're working on it everyday.WILLIAMS: Eric.BOLLING: So can I go back to the White House?PLOUFFE: Yeah.BOLLING: You ever watch ""The Five,"" does the White House watch ""The Five""?PLOUFFE: You know I see clips, I see transcripts.GUILFOYLE: Oh, God.PLOUFFE: I was generally too busy at 5:00 to watch it. But yeah, you see what you guys say, of course.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Would you say to the President, hey, did you see what they said today?PLOUFFE: You know, generally, he's more focused on -- if he doesn't, he would.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: I'm convinced -- if he doesn't he would.WILLIAMS: One last political question ...PLOUFFE: I'm going to let that pass.WILLIAMS: Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York suddenly endorsing Hillary Clinton. Does this mean anything with that middle you're talking about, trying to persuade them to come over?PLOUFFE: Well he does have credibility. So to me -- listen, what this election come down OK? Hillary Clinton has to maximize Democratic turnout. Donald Trump has to maximize Republican turnout. Hillary Clinton is going to try to get some suburban college women Republicans, Donald Trump is going to get some conservative Democrats, and then you got this group in the middle, that's not particularly large but they are moderate voters, they probably view both candidates unfavorably but they're going to vote. So the truth is, that's what the campaign is about.WILLIAMS: And big that group is?PLOUFFE: Well, in this election it's going to be a little bit bigger. It could be 8 to 10 percent. In our race with Romney and McCain it was smaller, it was more like 5 to 6 percent. But this is where Trump not really having a campaign, you do pay a price for that. You can't tweet your way to the presidency, you have to have a sense of who the voters are, what's the best way to go after them and have organization.GUILFOYLE: Yeah organization. Organization is key. I think President Obama will help bring it together with his speech.WILLIAMS: But you think Trump doesn't have the infrastructure, the advertising game even with the super PAC?PLOUFFE: Well the super PACs will fill the advertising void. I think the most important thing that happens in presidential politics is actually grassroots door knocking. So we in both Obama campaigns measured very carefully, we're anal about this. What's the best way to convince someone to vote or to convince a swing voter to vote for you? A human being talking to another human being ...WILLIAMS: I got to go though. A big thank you David, thanks for joining us tonight. We hope you'll come back to ""The Five"" again. That's it for us.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.
