This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to ""Hannity."" Tonight, President Obama lashes out at Christians and the Fox News Channel. Now, audio of an interview that the president did in mid-September has just been released. Now, listen to him as he takes major shots at Christians!(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Here in the United States, sometimes Christian interpretation seems to posit an ""us versus them."" How do you reconcile the idea of faith being really important to you and you caring a lot about taking faith seriously, with the fact that, at least in our democracy and our civic discourse, it seems as if folks who take religion the most seriously sometimes are also those who are suspicious of those not like them?(END AUDIO CLIP)HANNITY: Now, remember, this is a president who goes to great lengths to defend Islam. Remember these things?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: The United States is not and will never be at war with Islam.And I'm also proud to carry with me the good will of the American people and a greeting of peace for Muslim communities in my country.  Asalaam Aleikum.Islam is not part of the problem in combating violent extremism, it is an important part of promoting peace.Our enemies respect no religious freedom. Al Qaeda's cause is not Islam, it's a gross distortion of Islam.The future must not belong to those who slander the Prophet of Islam.ISIL is not Islamic. No religion condones the kill of innocents. And the vast majority of ISIL's victims have been Muslim.We have reaffirmed again and again that the United States is not and never will be at war with Islam. Islam teaches peace.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Sorry, Mr. President, but the Islamic State is radical Islam. And the president loves to lecture Christians about what they should and shouldn't be doing while praising Islam and ignoring the fact that he sat in the pews of Reverend Jeremiah Wright's church for 20 years.And as a reminder, here are some of the vile things that his ex-pastor said in the Church of GD America.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REV. JEREMIAH WRIGHT: We bombed Hiroshima! We bombed Nagasaki! And we nuked far more than the thousands in New York and the Pentagon, and we never batted an eye because the stuff we have done overseas is now brought right back into our own front yards! America's chickens are coming home to roost!No, no, no, not God bless America, God damn America that's in the Bible! We're killing innocent people! God damn America for treating her citizens as less than human!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: And that's not all. During the same interview, President Obama once again attacked the FOX News Channel. Listen to this.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)OBAMA: It's interesting because we're talking in Iowa. People always, I think, were surprised about me connecting with folks in small- town Iowa. And the reason I did was, first of all, I had the benefit that at the time, nobody expected me to win. And so I wasn't viewed through this prism of Fox News and conservative media and making me scary. At the time, I didn't think scary. (INAUDIBLE) having a funny name.(LAUGHTER)OBAMA: I seemed to be young. (ph)(END AUDIO CLIP)HANNITY: Here with reaction, 2016 Republican presidential candidate Senator, Ted Cruz, who, by the way, now has leapt into third place in the latest Fox News poll. He is one of only three candidates now in double digits, as we put it up on the screen.Senator, this is now a growing trend. You have been now increasing your numbers in the polls. You also had an incredible quarter in terms of donations. What is going on? This is obviously now a pattern. Things have changed for the better. Why do you think that's happened?SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, you know, Sean, I'm very encouraged by the momentum we're seeing. You know, historically, in the Republican primary, there have been two main lanes, a moderate lane and a conservative lane. And in past cycles, the moderate lane, there's been a consensus choice early on, and that person has all the money.And on the conservative lane, nobody's had any money and we've fought like cats and dogs and splintered the vote. That's how the moderate wins the nomination, and then goes and loses the general.Well, this cycle, that whole thing has flipped. It's backwards. The moderates -- that lane is crowded as all get-out. They're fighting like crazy. And on the conservative side, what we're seeing is conservatives uniting behind our campaign.You know, you look at the two who dropped out, Scott Walker and Rick Perry, both very good men, good governors. They were competing in the conservative lane. And what we're seeing every day is more and more conservatives uniting, saying, We don't need another establishment candidate to lose the race. We need a strong conservative who will stand up and take on Washington. I think that's why we've got the incredible momentum we've got right now.HANNITY: All right, let me ask about what you just heard from the president. I mean, he sat in the pews of Wright for 20 years, lectures Christians repeatedly now, you know, horrible deeds done in the name of Christ, and bends over backwards on the issue of Islam!How do you interpret this president? Add to that the Iranian deal, which to me is a matter of madness and insanity. What do you make of it?CRUZ: Listen, the far left has always had a strong anti-American streak, and it's always had an antipathy for Christians. That is true of the far left. It's been true from the very beginning. And so you know, you listen to Reverend Wright's sermons, they're stomach turning, but they reflect the views of the hard left.You know, Obama was four years ahead of me at Harvard law school, and I've described Obama as the perfect Harvard law school president because he reflects the views of the elite academy. Now, when Obama and I were both students -- this is not an exaggeration, Sean -- there were fewer presidents -- fewer professors on the Harvard law school faculty who were Republicans than there were communists. More professors, if you asked them, would say, I'm a Marxist. That's the world Obama came from.And if you look at the elite academy, if you look at the far left, they view America's role in the world as fundamentally illegitimate. You listen to what Jeremiah Wright is saying, America's foreign policy, in their view, has been wrong. It is oppression It is hegemony.Now, you and I both know that is utter nonsense. America has been an incredible force for good in this world. No nation in the history of the world has spilled more blood or treasure for freedom. And yet the far left, out of which Barack Obama rose, despises American leadership in the world.If you want to understand where ""leading from behind"" comes from, it is from those fever pitches of the far left that believe America's leadership in the world is wrong, and that's why the world has gotten so dangerous with America no longer leading.HANNITY: Sixty percent of Republicans feel betrayed by Washington Republicans.CRUZ: Yes.HANNITY: You're not included in that list. And those predictions that your filibuster would lead to a disaster in 2014 -- that never materialized. Do those Republicans deserve that label, betrayed? That is a severe term.CRUZ: Well, it is, but the problem is, Republican leadership keeps making promises to the American people, and then they violate those promises. You know, what I have urged leadership in both the House and Senate to do is simply do what we said we would do.We campaigned and say we would fight to stop ""Obama care."" How about we do it? We campaigned saying we would fight to stop President Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty. How about we do it? We said we'd stop taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood. We said we'd stop this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. How about we do it?And every time I stand up and fight against Obama and for the priorities we promised the American people, do you know who's fighting on the other side? It's not even Obama. It's leadership in the Republican Party who are fighting to fund every one of Barack Obama's priorities!HANNITY: It's inexplicable!CRUZ: That's why the American people feel betrayed.HANNITY: It's inexplicable to me! Whey -- why then make the promise if then they're going to -- and then attack the guy that's trying to make - - you know, keep the promises that all of them made? Why -- it's like you've become a pariah among Republicans for just attempting to keep a promise!What has happened there that things...CRUZ: Well, look...HANNITY: ... have gotten so distorted that they have lost touch this way?CRUZ: Well, but it's not about me. It's not about any one person.  It's about the American people. I'm trying to give voice to the frustration of the American people, and leadership looks down on the voters who elected us. That's the divide.And what they don't like is anyone who stands with the American people and says -- it's a very simple message -- Let's do today what we said in September, October, November of the election year we would do.You know, I spent two months at the end of 2014 traveling the country with Senate candidates all over the country. I think I slept in my own bed four or five nights in those last 60 days campaigning to win the Senate.  And I stood next to Senate candidate after Senate candidate who promised, Give us a majority, retire Harry Reid, and we will stand and fight.And here's the problem. Republican leadership -- not only do they not want to fight, but they are fighting to fund Obama's priorities...HANNITY: Do those senators...CRUZ: ... every single one of Obama's priorities!HANNITY: ... want to fight? Do those people that made those promises -- do they stand with you, or have they been coopted already?CRUZ: You know, I -- leadership can be very effective wrapping people in their arms. I sure hope we see more Republicans standing up and just doing what we said we would do.HANNITY: All right, stay right there. We're going to...CRUZ: You know, it's interesting. I'm...HANNITY: Go ahead. No, go ahead.CRUZ: I was saying I'm traveling right now through Iowa. We're doing a barnstorming tour. We do town halls all over the state. And I ask people, I say, We were told in 2010, Give us a Republican majority in the House and things will be different. Millions of us rose up. We won a majority. Very little changed.Then we were told the problem was the Senate. We had to retire Harry Reid. Millions of us rose up. And I ask people in town halls all over Iowa, in 10 months of Republican control of both houses of Congress, what on earth have they accomplished?Now, every town hall I've ever done, the answer is the same. People call out, Absolutely nothing. And you know, sadly, Sean, the answer is worse than nothing. It would have been better if they'd done nothing.What, in fact, they've done, right after the election, Republican leadership came back, joined with Harry Reid, passed a trillion-dollar cromnibus bill filled with pork, filled with corporate welfare. Then they funded ""Obama care."" Then they funded amnesty . Then they funded Planned Parenthood. And then Republican leadership took the lead confirming Loretta Lynch as attorney general!Every bit of that is exactly what Harry Reid and the Democrats would have done. That's why people are so frustrated.HANNITY: We'll have more with Senator Ted Cruz right after this break.Also tonight, right here on ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you can prove me wrong, but I don't think you're a friend to women. How -- what...(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I knew I shouldn't have picked her!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Huge controversy. A Jeb Bush volunteer grills Donald Trump at a town hall event. The two campaigns are now exchanging words over that testy encounter. We'll show you the full video.Plus, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich here to talk about the 2016 campaign and the GOP leadership shake-up. That and more as ""Hannity"" continues.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)HANNITY: And welcome back to ""Hannity."" A war of words has erupted between Republican rivals Donald Trump and Jeb Bush because of this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you can prove me wrong, but I don't think that you're a friend to women. How -- what...(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I knew I shouldn't have picked her. I knew I shouldn't have picked her! I have given women more opportunity than I would say virtually anybody in the construction industry. I have a daughter named Ivanka and a wife named Melania who constantly want me to talk about women's health issues because they know how I feel about it.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So if you become president, will a woman make the same as a man? And do I get to choose what I do with my body?(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: You're going to make the same if you do as good a job.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Now, the woman you just saw question Donald Trump was later discovered to be a Bush campaign volunteer. After that revelation, Donald Trump -- he took to Twitter. He wrote, quote, ""The arrogant woman who questioned me in such a nasty fashion at the No Labels event yesterday was a Jeb staffer. How can he beat Russia and China?""Earlier today, the Bush campaign responded by taking a shot at Donald Trump in a statement that reads, in part, ""Like many in New Hampshire, Lauren is a student who's passionate about and active in politics and attended this event on her own accord. Now, those (sic) question was not sanctioned by the campaign, and we can't help but notice Mr. Trump does seem to be very sensitive about being challenged by women.""So are these feuds among GOP candidates helping or hurting the party?  Responding to that, 2016 GOP hopeful Senator Ted Cruz.Senator, is this good or bad?CRUZ: Oh, listen, I like Donald Trump and I like Jeb Bush. You know, the way -- I'm not going to get in the middle of their shooting back and forth. The way I've been conducting my campaign -- I think the American people could not care less about politicians bickering like children. I think they're interested in real and positive solutions to the problems in this country.It's one of the reasons that the first two debates, you know, the moderators have tried to turn them into food fights. I've stayed out of it, said, Look, I'm not interested in tearing people down and engaging in personal insults. Let's focus on how we bring back jobs and economic growth, how we defend the Constitution and restore America's leadership.  That's what the American people are looking for.HANNITY: Let me ask -- there's a lot of -- the reporters in this country will say there's chaos in the House. I actually think this is an opportunity for the House with John Boehner now out. Paul Ryan's name keeps getting mentioned a lot, but a lot of conservatives don't like his position on immigration. I know you feel passionately about immigration, sanctuary cities.CRUZ: Yes.HANNITY: Tell me about that, but also tell me, who would you like to see as speaker? We have Newt Gingrich coming on next. Would you like to see him as speaker?CRUZ: Well, look, I think very highly of Newt. I think he's brilliant, and is a great strategist. And then Newt is a friend, someone who I visit often.You know, in terms of who the House should select as a speaker, I very deliberately stay out of that. I think that's a decision for the House Republican conference.I have, however, laid out the characteristics that I think the next speaker should have. I think the next speaker should be a strong conservative, and most importantly, the next speaker should be committed to honoring the promises we made to the men and women who elected us.You and I were talking just a few minutes ago about the great gulf (ph) theory is because people make promises on campaign day and they don't follow through. And Sean, let me give an example of that in the presidential context. You know, in the presidential race, every presidential candidate is saying, Vote for me, and I will stand up and fight Washington. Well, the natural next question is, OK, when have you ever fought Washington?And you know, you think back to 2013, when millions of Americans rose up against ""Obama care"" -- I was proud to lead that fight. And of the other 10 people on that debate stage, where were they? None of the other folks there led in any meaningful way.HANNITY: What about...CRUZ: You think about -- yes?HANNITY: But there's an inordinate fear that has rendered them impotent. They seem unwilling to use their constitutional authority even to stop something that they all declared was illegal and unconstitutional, an executive order of amnesty or to defund Planned Parenthood or to defund ""Obama care"" or the aspects that they could defund.All the president -- all the Democrats to say is, Whoops, we're going to blame you for shutting down the government, and they surrender.CRUZ: Right. Well, look...HANNITY: So doesn't the next speaker have to be willing to allow the president to shut down the government if they fund every other aspect of the government but his special priorities?CRUZ: We shouldn't have a shutdown, but the situation is Republican leadership has promised we'll never, ever, ever have a shutdown. And Obama said, A-ha, I have a magic key. All I have to do is whisper the word ""shutdown,"" and Republican leadership will surrender and run for the hills.So on every policy issues, he says, Fund all of ""Obama care"" or I'll shut the government down, and Republican leadership says, Great. He says, Fund amnesty or I'll shut the government down.HANNITY: Well, that's my point...CRUZ: Same thing on Planned Parenthood, same thing on Iran.HANNITY: But when the president...CRUZ: We've got to be willing to stand our ground.HANNITY: When the president will literally defy the law and the laws of Congress -- for example, we have all these sanctuary cities set up across America.CRUZ: Yes.HANNITY: Why did I always think that that was illegal, that the president's executive order is illegal? You've spoken out about these things recently.CRUZ: That's exactly right. The Senate next week is going to vote on legislation that I introduced, along with a number of other senators, including Iowa's own Chuck Grassley, to end sanctuary cities, to strip all federal funding of any city that defies federal the immigration law and to pass Kate's Law, the legislation that I introduced that provides for a mandatory minimum prison sentence of five years for any aggregated felon who enters illegally.You know, it's the legislation named for Kate Steinle, that beautiful young lady murdered by an illegal alien in San Francisco, a sanctuary city.  I'm glad we're voting next week. But you know, Sean, we're going to vote on it and almost surely, there'll be a party-line vote. The Democrats will vote no. We'll get some clarity on that. The Democrats -- it'll be clear where they stand.But you know, I have a question. Just two weeks ago, we passed a continuing resolution. Why wouldn't Republican leadership put sanctuary cities legislation and Kate's Law on a continuing resolution and put it on Obama's desk and force him to decide, does he shut the government down...HANNITY: Well, said.CRUZ: ... in order to maintain sanctuary cities?HANNITY: Well said. Senator, congratulations. You had a big jump in the polls in this latest FOX News poll. You're now in double digits. And see you out on the campaign trail. Thank you for your time.CRUZ: Well, thank you, Sean. And the momentum is incredible. People keep going every day to Tedcruz.org, Tedcruz.org, contributing, volunteering, and I'm really encouraged at how many conservatives are coming together to turn the country around.HANNITY: All right, Senator. We hope so. We need to turn the country around.And coming up, former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich -- he's here to weigh in on the 2016 GOP field and also, the Republican leadership shake-up in Washington.Also later tonight, an explosive new book just released today about Bill and Hillary Clinton exposes how the power couple has treated women while rising to power. Now, the author claims they, quote, ""systematically abused women."" He'll join us next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" And here now to talk about the 2016 race and the GOP shake-up in Washington, author of the brand-new book -- it's called ""Duplicity"" -- former speaker of the House, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich.Mr. Speaker, great to have you in the studio.NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER: Great to be back.HANNITY: Congrats on the new book. We'll talk about it in a second.You're a student of history. We have four outsider insurgent candidates. You have Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, who we just had on. They take over 60 percent of the vote. Sixty percent of Republicans feel Washington Republicans betrayed them!As you look at this through the prism of history, ever seen anything like this?GINGRICH: No. This is historic in the sense of the pre-Civil War period. What you have here is -- and the Gallup people have been giving me data -- 75 percent of the country thinks we have widespread corruption in the government. Fifty percent of the country now is afraid of their own government. You have the average American believes 51 cents out of every federal dollar is wasted.I mean, these numbers are building and people are looking at their lives and going, Why doesn't Washington hear me? And they want somebody -- and the numbers are now clear. They prefer by a big margin somebody who has never been in public office but has a record in the private sector.  And that's what -- I think that's what's driving Trump and Carson and Fiorina.And then Cruz is the most outside insider we've ever seen. I mean, Cruz is not an insider. He's one of the four. And as you point out, between them -- they're pretty even today -- I think those numbers -- they're at about 62 percent nationally.HANNITY: It's crazy. Do you think they sustain it, or maybe do people get cold feet in the end and say, Maybe we need to go with the establishment guy?GINGRICH: Look, I think if it was one person, you could say, Boy, if that person makes a big enough mistake -- but the fact that there are four of them -- I mean, I think about being a conventional candidate because, like you, I've got great friends who are running, who I really think are terrific human beings. I can't figure out how they get past the four of them.So if Trump were to falter -- and so far, there's no sign of that -- the default would go to Carson. If you look at who the second choice is for Trump, they're going to split between Carson and Cruz.HANNITY: The Freedom Caucus pretty much took John Boehner out. It was a no-confidence vote. He would not have been able to sustain his position. Then they came out against Kevin McCarthy. McCarthy's out.Paul Ryan is thinking about running, and all I've been reading is one conservative group after another does not want him speaker for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is his position on immigration. He hasn't taken that bold a conservative stand on any big issue at any important moment. So nobody else seems to want the job!GINGRICH: Well (INAUDIBLE) first of all, Paul Ryan is probably the smartest member of the House party. The work he's done on the budget, the work he's done to try to reform health care, the work he's doing now on taxes -- I mean, Ryan is a very serious guy.HANNITY: And one of the nicest guys you'll meet, I'll say that.GINGRICH: Nice person. Callista has known him since he was an intern. They're both from Wisconsin.But what I'm trying to get people in Washington to understand is it's not about the Freedom Caucus. It's about the country. When 60 percent of your own party is saying to you, I want real change, then the Freedom Caucus -- and George Will said this pretty well on Sunday. He said, look, the House was designed to reflect turmoil in the country by having turmoil in Washington, and the Senate's designed to sort of hide from it.HANNITY: Because they're the closest to the people, the direct representatives.GINGRICH: That's right. And so I think everyone who goes home this week -- with the House out this week, people are home. And I suspect what they're hearing is that people want somebody closer to Trump or Carson or Fiorina or Cruz than they do to a normal establishment figure.HANNITY: So I thought -- I look at your term as speaker, and I think I speak fairly objectively. There's not been a more consequential, successful speakership than yours. You've literally laid out renewing American civilization. That became the foundation for Republicans coming into power for the first time in 40 years. You laid out a contract with America. You fulfilled every one of the promises voted on those items in 100 days. You are the last speaker to balance a budget and give us a surplus. You are the last speaker to get real welfare reform, transformative stuff. Maybe some people only remember the end of your speakership. Now, I know, because I speak to House Freedom Caucus members, that they want you to go speak to them. Will you do that?GINGRICH: Of course. Look, I am very flattered. I would point out that John Kasich played a major part of balancing that budget.HANNITY: Other members did, but you were the leader. You were the architect.GINGRICH: And what I've said both to members of the leadership and to members of both the Freedom Caucuses, I am very happy. Callista and I both love the House, we believe in the House. We're very happy to be advisers, we're happy to sit down with them next week when they get back from this break and to lay out how do we get to a strategy of winning for the country, not just for the Republican Party, but how do we get past Barack Obama and past the Democrats in the Senate and actually get something done.HANNITY: Let me ask an important question. I asked this to Kevin McCarthy when he was on. I think he could have given a better answer.  Republicans said that they would stop executive action on immigration and they would defund it. They ended up funding it. Same thing on Obamacare.  There's this inordinate paranoia, fear for being blamed for a government shutdown. How many times did you shut down the government?GINGRICH: It's very funny. I just wrote a piece two days ago about the catastrophic 2013 shutdown which led, of course, to the Republican landslide of 2014. We had two shutdowns in 95 which led to the first reelection since 1928. There's no question that your numbers go down during a shutdown. But if Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan had worried about their poll numbers week by week, they wouldn't have been Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan.HANNITY: So is defunding Planned Parenthood, stopping executive amnesty, defunding Obamacare, which is the constitutional authority -- the constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress -- would those be three items you'd be willing to shut down the government if you were speaker.GINGRICH: First of all, I wouldn't set it up so that I would shut down the government. I would say the opposite. I would say, is Barack Obama so committed to cutting up babies, which is what they were doing, is he so committed to cutting up babies that he would shut down the entire government?Second, I would want to have a strategy that says we're going to fund, in a separate bill we're going to fund national defense, we're going to fund homeland security, we're going to fund the FBI, everything which relates to your safety. Now, is the president going to veto everything which relates to your safety? Are the Democrats in the Senate going to filibuster? You have to have a strategy, and you have to have a communications plan before you get to the crunch. You can't get to the crunch, and then start talking.HANNITY: So the answer is you would be willing to let the president shut down the government and fund all essential government programs for defense and safety.GINGRICH: Callista and I are currently working on a movie on George Washington, which we think is very important to remind the country who we are.HANNITY: Yes.GINGRICH: We only have the power of the purse to control a president who is imperial. And if the Congress is not willing to exercise the power of the purse, then you're inevitably going to get an imperial president.HANNITY: Tell me about this new book, by the way.GINGRICH: ""Duplicity"" starts with a very intriguing family. You have a Somali American, totally patriotic, running for Congress in Minneapolis, and you have his brother, who has decided he's against this, is the number two leader of al Shabaab in Somalia. So you have this tension between international terrorism and American politics. You have a president, it happens to be a woman, not necessarily Hillary, could be Carly Fiorina.  You have a woman president running for reelection, and she makes a decision that is political about national security, and it blows up and they decide they have to lie about it.HANNITY: All right, you're going to be on a book tour. I'm doing something sneaky, but I'll take the liberty because I've known you now for many years.(LAUGHTER)   GINGRICH: And you've been sneaky since I first --HANNITY: That's true. I haven't changed a bit, have I? I'm going to ask your wife whether she supports the idea, because people like me think you should be the next speaker. So we're going to bring you back later in the show.GINGRICH: All right.HANNITY: All right.And coming up tonight, damning new book alleges the Clintons for years have systematically abused women. The author, Roger Stone, is here with the shocking details.         Also, Newt Gingrich will be back. We'll ask his wife what she thinks about him potentially being speaker, and we'll talk about their brand new book and more, straight ahead.        (COMMERCIAL BREAK)     HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" For years the Clintons have claimed to be champions of women's rights, and Hillary even made it a part of her campaign in 2016. But tonight an explosive new book completely destroys that narrative. Author Roger Stone claims that the Clintons have, quote, ""systematically abused women"" and even alleges that Hillary Clinton helped silence women who were targeted by her husband. Joining us now for the discussion of his brand-new book, you can see it right there, destined to be a bestseller ""The Clintons' War on Women,"" Roger Stone is back with us. Roger, how are you?ROGER STONE, ""THE CLINTONS' WAR ON WOMEN"" AUTHOR: Sean, thanks for having me.HANNITY: I've been reading the book. It is explosive. They claim to have this mantle that they're the champion of women's rights. These are the biggest abusers of women that you're describing in this book. And Hillary's a part of it.STONE: The book is really about hypocrisy. She denigrates you. She trashes you as a bimbo, a slut, trailer trash. And then she hires private detectives, heavy-handed private detectives, Anthony Pellicano, Jack Palladino, Ivan Duda, to threaten you, to harass you into silence lest you get in the way of their quest for power.HANNITY: Isn't this the same woman who recently said that if you're a victim of sexual assault you have a right to be believed? Has she ever come out in defense of the women that you mention in this book?STONE: You have a right to be believed unless you're Eileen Wellstone or Juanita Broaddrick or Carolyn Moffet or Liz Ward Gracen or Becky Brown or Helen Dowdy or Paula Jones or Kathy Ferguson or Christy Zercher, or my friend Kathy Willey, in which case those women are abused and they're psychologically abused. Bill abuses them physically and then Hillary abuses them psychological. So this is really why I wrote the book.HANNITY: We've know a lot about it. I interviewed Juanita Broaddrick. She gave two interviews, me and Lisa Myers right here on this channel, that interview aired. And if you ask me, because I interviewed Willey, I interview Paula Jones, Gennifer Flowers, and others, I believe every one of them. And there is a pattern here.STONE: One of the reasons, of course, is because these women are petrified. They've been threatened, their pets killed, their children threatened, their homes ransacked, their cars vandalized, their tires slashed. So they don't step forward. That's actually part of the plan.HANNITY: This I think needs to be read by anybody that thinks Hillary is a champion of women's rights. Roger Stone, thank you for being with us.  See you soon.STONE: Thanks for having me.HANNITY: Coming up, Newt Gingrich joins us again along with his wife Callista. We'll ask her what she thinks about him potentially being the next speaker of the House, straight ahead.          (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his wife Callista are both accomplished authors. And Newt is the author of a brand new book, ""Duplicity,"" a political thriller set during the time of an American presidential election, how timely. Callista Gingrich has written a new book in her Ellis the Elephant children's book series. It's titled ""Christmas in America"" and explains how the holiday has been celebrated in America. And they're both now here to explain it.  By the way, congratulations. You are doing book signings. I know you were at Huntington earlier tonight. You're going to be at Book Ends in New Jersey tomorrow.CALLISTA GINGRICH, AUTHOR: That's right.HANNITY: And I guess go to your website.GINGRICH: Go to Gingrich Productions. We have five weeks of book signings.HANNITY: Five weeks? This is a very important five weeks. Before I get to the book, what do you think of the idea that I and others have suggested that maybe Newt be the next speaker?CALLISTA GINGRICH: Well, you know, Sean, I worked in the House for many years. I love it as an institution, and both Newt and I are deeply committed citizens. I think it's unlikely that he'll become speaker again, but I do have to say, if push comes to shove, we may have to step forward and help.HANNITY: Don't you think he could help the Republicans? Isn't he a better strategist, tactician, wouldn't a new contract be invigorating for the Republican considering 60 percent of Americans feel betrayed by them?CALLISTA GINGRICH: Yes. I think Newt is brilliant, and I'm biased.  I'm his wife, obviously.   HANNITY: He's pretty smart.     CALLISTA GINGRICH: His records speak for itself.HANNITY: I know both of you personally, so maybe I'm a little biased.  Since he's been speaker, am I accurate in saying he's probably read at least 1,000 books?CALLISTA GINGRICH: At least, but he reads on his iPad now so I never know what he's reading.HANNITY: What are you reading?GINGRICH: Tons of stuff.   HANNITY: OK. You have taken to your faith more. So if Newt Gingrich came back as speaker, and I'm just throwing this you, you're a more faithful person. I mean, meeting the Pope, going to the Pope, you were singing when he was in Washington. This is more important than it's ever been in your life, right? You've changed?GINGRICH: Well, just a week together in Israel. And you can't walk where Christ walked and not have some deep sense of God's rule in your life and being subordinated to this extraordinary experience.HANNITY: Yes. All right, so explain how this works. You guys go on a book tour. You talk politics. You talk children's books. How does that work out when you're addressing these crowds?GINGRICH: Well, the people who have children love her and grandchildren love her, and the people who like politics like me. We draw two different crowds to the same room.HANNITY: At least Ellis is not a donkey. That would not be a good thing.CALLISTA GINGRICH: That's right. I write these books because I love our country and I think it truly is an exceptional nation. And it's more important now than ever that our children understand why this country is so special.HANNITY: What did you think of this news this week where you can no longer celebrate Columbus Day, but it's indigenous people's day?CALLISTA GINGRICH: You know, Sean, that is the environment we live in now. But Christmas in America is such an important holiday. It's really the traditions we celebrate. Some of the best things about America we see at Christmas time. We value faith, family, friends, charity, and these are values we've embodied for over 400 years in this country.HANNITY: The most wonder full time of the year. Congratulations.  Good to see you. I'm really looking forward to you speaking to the Freedom Caucus. But more important, ""Duplicity,"" ""Christmas in America"" at bookstores together. You can see the book signings on your website. Thank you both for being with us. Congratulations.CALLISTA GINGRICH: Thanks, Sean.HANNITY: When we come back, ""Ask Sean"" is up next, plus we need your help with a very important ""Question of the Day."" It might have a little bit to do with the topic that I just raised, straight ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back. Time for tonight's ""Question of the Day."" So is President Obama a hypocrite for attacking Christians after attending the church of Reverend Wright, the church of GD America for over 20 years? I think it's obvious. Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter let us know what you think.   Time now for our ""Ask Sean"" segment.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sean, nearly all Democrats believe that the Planned Parenthood videos are false, misleading, or just a flat out lie.  I'd like to know what evidence they have that makes them believe this, because to me they never seem they can back it up.         (END VIDEO CLIP)        HANNITY: It's a great question. I think it's very transparent to anybody what they were involved in, which is, in my opinion, illegal activity. And remember, the group that unveiled this, they also released the entire video. So it's clear they were selling baby body parts and changing abortion procedures so that they could harvest these organ and then sell them in the hopes of being able to buy a Lamborghini.         But the problem is we live in a political age where there is such hyper partisan people on the left. I'm convinced if you had a video of Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton robbing a bank and shooting a teller, they would say no, they're giving money to the poor, and they'd make some excuse. So you really can't overcome hyper-partisanship like that, sad, but true.        By the way, if you have a question for me, just go over to Twitter, #AskSean, or even better yet, send in a video and you can be a big TV star.  We hope you'll join us for that.         Also, quick programming note. We will be back tonight in, what, one hour, at midnight with live reaction to tonight's snooze fest Democratic debate. We'll see you back here in one hour later tonight.

6	6	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2009/06/10/new-rule-book	 The New Rule Book 	"President Obama says he doesn't want to run auto companies and he doesn't want to run banks.He probably means that, but it doesn't matter: He's now running both and he can't stop now and he'll have plenty of help from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.That's because once the government pumps billions of taxpayer dollars into private enterprises, there is no way the firms can continue to operate by the rules of business. They now operate by the rules of politics.That explains the appointment of a new government overseer to make sure that companies receiving federal dollars don't pay executives at levels that might embarrass Washington. And that explains what happened when General Motors decided to close a warehouse in Norton, Massachusetts.Congressman Barney Frank, who represents the area, got involved on behalf of his constituents. One phone call to the company later, the warehouse was spared.Congressman Frank -- by the way -- said Wednesday that when it comes to pay, he and his fellow congressmen will be ""less intrusive"" toward companies that do not get government money.What a relief.Mr. Frank will of course hold a hearing on the issue. Earlier, car dealers slated for elimination by the auto companies had their hearing in Congress, which was sympathetic.There will be many more such trips to Washington by executives who will soon realize that this is where their real boards of directors now sit.-- Brit Hume is the senior political analyst for FOX News Channel."

7	7	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2009/06/23/turning-point-obama-presidency	 Turning Point for Obama Presidency? 	The president's news conference today may have marked a turning point in his young presidency.A White House Press Corps that had been ridiculed for its allegedly fawning coverage was asking tough questions. And a president noted for his easy self-assurance was defensive and even testy at times. He insisted there was nothing new in his tough, and unmistakably new, language on Iran. He never did answer the question of whether the invitation still stands to Iranian diplomats to come to U.S. embassies around the world to celebrate the 4th of July.These are critical and difficult days for Mr. Obama. His job approval ratings, while still high, have fallen. His support among independents, the crucial swing vote in American politics, has dropped from 60 percent in April to 45 percent now.His health care proposals are in some trouble on Capitol Hill, amid growing public alarm about the staggering amount of deficit spending they will require. The proximate cause of that worry, of course, is the $787 billion spending spree he let Congress embark on in the name of economic stimulus last winter.The unemployment rate that spending was supposed to hold below eight percent has raced past nine percent and is still rising.In the beginning, it seems, charm and style count, but in the end it's the results that count most.-- Brit Hume is the senior political analyst for FOX News Channel.

But in politics, nothing occurs in a vacuum and this trip occurs at a time when the president runs the risk of appearing to go out of his way to pursue a clearly minor objective at the expense of other major objectives.The president says, for example, that he will take the time to get the strategy right before deciding whether to dispatch more troops to Afghanistan. But he announced a strategy back in March and sent General McChrystal to achieve it.Now that the general wants more troops, Obama wants more time. How often has he spoken to the general? Once, in the past 70 days.Initially, the president said he was not going to Denmark because he was too busy pressing for health care reform. The White House says that situation has improved. Really? The latest polls show support for his ideas at an all-time low.And Iran, which has met Obama's overtures of engagement with nose-thumbing and missile tests, now says it won't even discuss its nuclear ambitions with the U.S.-- Brit Hume is the senior political analyst for FOX News Channel.

In a new campaign ad called ""Keep and Bear,"" Skelton does not shoot any firearms the way West Virginia's Joe Manchin does, but Skelton touts his NRA endorsement and talks about the Second Amendment's importance to rural Missouri.Skelton accuses Republican Vicki Hartzler of letting ""the government decide, not gun owners, on the issue of carrying concealed weapons."" Hartzler insists she opposed the referendum on the subject because she felt it should be up to individuals.Cash OutBillionaire financier George Soros says he is sitting out this election cycle preferring to funnel his considerable funds to progressive groups rather than electoral politics. The New York Times asked Soros if it worries him that Republicans could take over one or both Houses of Congress. Soros answered, ""It does, because I think they are pushing the wrong policies. But I'm not in a position to stop it. I don't believe in standing in the way of an avalanche.""Plane FunnyFormer funnyman and current Minnesota Senator Al Franken still has it. The New York Post reports Franken was at Reagan National Airport with fellow Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar talking about which security line he was going to take. Franken said he enjoys the line where they pat you down ""the way my marriage is going these days.""His office insists it was just a joke."	['Hartzler', 'Klobuchar', 'Manchin', 'Franken']	[]
