"This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" May 3, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight, Senator Ted Cruz just ended his campaign for president. And at this moment, we are awaiting remarks from Donald Trump. The presumptive Republican nominee for president.Welcome to ""The Kelly File"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly on a historic evening for America and for the Republican Party. Remember, it was close to 11 months ago New York businessman Donald Trump descended the Trump Tower escalator to announce his candidacy for the highest office in the land. At the time, critics believed his campaign would soon implode. Instead, he took the political world by storm and broke all the rules in the process.  Fast-forward to Indiana, a state largely viewed as a do or die primary.  For Texas Senator Ted Cruz and the Never Trump Movement at large.Instead, that firewall collapsed, as the Indiana voters largely sided with Mr. Trump, putting him less than 200 delegates away now from securing the GOP nomination outright. As for the Democrats, we're still waiting to see what happens there. And what of Ohio Governor John Kasich? Earlier tonight, he promised to fight on. It's wait and see if that still stands, given Senator Cruz's decision, which the Texas senator spoke out about just moments ago. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We gave it everything we have got. But the voters chose another path. And so, with a heavy heart, but with boundless optimism, for the long-term future of our nation, we are suspending our campaign.(CROWD): No!CRUZ: But hear me now, I am not suspending our fight for liberty.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: We have a huge show lined up for you tonight. John Roberts have been following the Cruz campaign. But we begin with our Chief Political Correspondent campaign Carl Cameron reporting tonight from New York City.  Carl?CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: New York City, the home of the presumptive candidate nominee for the Republican nomination.  Hi, Megyn. The sign on the podium says, victory Indiana but in fact for Donald Trump, it is a victory across the country and across the Republican spectrum. The chairman of the Republican National Committee Reince Priebus just moments ago on social media twitted that Donald Trump will be the presumptive nominee. And it's time for the Republican Party to unite around him and prepare for the nominating convention in July at which he'll be unveiling his running-mate if not a few days on sooner.The campaign staff has been jubilant. Hugging occasionally tears and a tremendous amount of self-satisfied overwhelming joy. This team and this candidate has faced more scrutiny and more skepticism than any successful presidential candidate in the Republican Party in decades. And so tonight they feel of vindication and they also recognize tremendous challenges.  They recognize that they have catching up to do in terms of the types of massive organization needed to run a general election campaign. And it's going to be a long one. He's effectively uncontested now with Cruz suspending no matter what Kasich does.And that means he has more time to plan to pick his running mate and they actually began some of those meetings this afternoon and they plan to continue them tomorrow. He'll be back on the campaign trail on Wednesday, excuse me, on Thursday in West Virginia. But Donald Trump now is looking national. It's not one state after the next. There are actually nine more remaining before the voting ends on June 7th. But for him now, it's time to start seriously looking at Hillary Clinton and he can put Ted Cruz and the 16 other rivals he's fought for almost a year in his rear view mirror -- Megyn.  KELLY: Carl, we'll be back to you just as soon as the candidate emerges.  Fox's John Roberts is with the Cruz campaign in Indianapolis, Indiana tonight. John?JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: And Megyn, it was very emotional here tonight as Ted Cruz suspended his campaign. There were many people who were openly crying, couldn't believe that he was actually up there on stage saying the words. But you know, it really wasn't much of a shock when you consider what happened here tonight, when you start to look at the results coming in across all of the counties, on 92 counties here in Indianapolis and noticing that Donald Trump was winning by substantial margins in all but three or four of them.It was pretty difficult for Ted Cruz to make a case that he can go on in this race. I mean, take a look at what he did here in Indiana, first of all he had that pack with John Kasich, with Kasich step aside. Then a couple of days later, he took the unprecedented steps of announcing his running-mate three months earlier. Three months before rather the convention. And then a couple of days after that, he got an endorsement, some say it was lit warm from the governor of Indiana. He couldn't have done much more here in Indiana to try to get the votes and ultimately the voters decided that they wanted to go with Donald Trump and not go with Ted Cruz.His only play and really his only play as of last Tuesday was for a contested convention in July. But when you get handed seven big defeats in a row, the way that Ted Cruz did, starting with New York and then the five primaries on the Acela primaries and then here in Indiana, he just looked forward and said, you know, how do I make the case to the money people in this race, to Americans to say, I've lost all of this, and yet I go forward. What remains to be seen, though, Megyn is, what does he do tomorrow? I don't know if he'll stay here in Indiana or he'll go back to either D.C. or Houston. And then what does he do with his more than 500 delegates that he has collected so far? All questions yet to be answered - - Megyn.KELLY: John Roberts, thank you, sir. So what's next? Monica Crowley is a Fox News contributor and host of the nationally syndicated radio program ""The Monica Crowley Show."" Stuart Stevens is a former Mitt Romney campaign strategist and founding partner at Strategic Partners and Media.Monica, let me start with you. It is a historic moment. It's something the GOP has never seen before. Even the two party system, an outsider, a billionaire, someone who had poked at the sitting president of the United States for months about whether he was in fact born in this country emerges seemingly out of nowhere to capture an incredibly powerful position and now face off with Hillary Clinton one-on-one for the keys to the Oval Office.  MONICA CROWLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It is such an astonishing turn of events, Megyn, just a year ago. If you would have told anybody that this would have been the outcome of the Republican race, nobody would have believed you. But I think this success of Donald Trump points to a number of things that have been going on in the Republican Party, in the conservative movement for a very long time. In the short recent past we saw the growth of the Tea Party in 2009-2010 where conservatives basically revolted against the Republican establishment.I think that has since morphed to include a lot of other people who feel betrayed. Betrayed and that's the word you get time and again in this exit polls, betrayed by not just the Republican establishment but the bipartisan ruling class.KELLY: Uh-hm.CROWLEY: And I think a lot of the calculation, Megyn, is, you know what?  Literally nothing could be worse than this. And we're going to roll the dice and try something completely different.  KELLY: They've said time and time again in the exit polls they don't care about the polls that say Donald Trump might lose to Hillary Clinton. They don't care. They're angry and they want to send a message. And they don't necessarily accept that Trump cannot win, but they tell the country that, even if he cannot, they're trying to be heard. Stuart, this was not the result you wanted. Your thoughts tonight.  STUART STEVENS, STRATEGIC PARTNERS AND MEDIA: Well, I think we have to say congratulations to Donald Trump. It's very difficult to win a nomination.  If that is in fact what he's done. He's done something that few people have done. He deserves congratulations. I'm not going to support Donald Trump. I think he represents the worst of politics, not the best. But, listen, a lot of people obviously disagree and have voted for him and have put their trust in him. I think this idea that you don't care, you just want to send a message, I think that's more of an emotion of the moment.  We'll see how that bears out in what will be a very long campaign.  KELLY: But what will you do now, Stuart? What will you and others like you, you know, honest, committed conservatives and others who had true objections to Trump? Can you get behind him? Can you put those objections to the side? I know you say no, but can you foresee it? Do you think that's just, you know, sort of the anguish of your moment?STEVENS: Well, you know, I didn't have a strong candidate in this race so I don't feel very anguished. I feel disappointed in the party. Listen, I think this is one of these moments in life where everybody is going to have to make their own decision. And I'm not going to do the Donald Trump thing and attack anyone who disagrees with me or disparages me. I respect differences. I respect choices. I respect that I might be wrong. But I know what my choice will be, which is simply I can't in good conscience back someone I feel is uniquely unqualified to be president of the United States.  KELLY: Will you back Hillary Clinton?STEVENS: And that's Donald Trump. I'm not going to go down that road, no.  I don't -- because I'm not backing Donald Trump doesn't mean that I have to back Hillary Clinton. You know, Republicans like to spend a lot of time saying that we helped defeat communism and one of the tenets of communism is you have to do what is best for the party. It would be a richly ironic moment if that was now turned to try force some of us who don't want to support Donald Trump to support Trump. I think it's a very individual choice. Everybody has to make it on their own. And just know that it's something you're going to have to live with for a long time.  KELLY: Uh-hm.STEVENS: Monica, we've spent so many months talking about the controversial things that Donald Trump has done. But does any of that matter now that he has won? And I understand the other argument, which is it's still on his record, right? And he's not done. He hasn't won the presidency. So, the question stands.  CROWLEY: You know, it's interesting, Megyn, because in listening to Stuart, and I know that the Never Trump movement is quite significant, but I think about something that Richard Nixon used to say, which is, when there is a movement to stop ""X,"" bet on ""X."" And that certainly holds true here in the case of Donald Trump. Look, I think it depends, to answer your question, I think it depends on whether or not Trump changes stylistically.  That kind of bombastic personality, some of the more outrageous things he's said, his supporters love that.His supporters have taken to it because they think that the country is in dire straits and that this is the man to solve a very grave problems. And they like that stylistically he's a take no prisoners kind of guy. He has said in the past that should he get the nomination he will be, quote, ""presidential."" He has said that in the past, Megyn, and we've seen that's lasted maybe 24 hours. But in that context, he still had a race to run and he still had two opponents to dispose of. Now that Ted Cruz is out of this race, John Kasich I guess remains, but this is his nomination. And we'll see if he switches gears.  KELLY: Yes.  CROWLEY: And realizes he's not just speaking for himself anymore. He's speaking for the party. The movement and essentially the United States.  KELLY: I want to bring you some breaking news. Fox News is now ready to project that Bernie Sanders has won the state of Indiana this evening, beating Hillary Clinton in a tight race there in a Democratic presidential primary. This is an upset victory against a front-runner that keeps this race alive on the Democratic side down the home stretch. She, Hillary Clinton had led Sanders in pre-election polls but it appears that not enough of her supporters actually turned out to vote for her today. We continue to await Donald Trump. And what a night for him and for his supporters who were told by the political class over and over and over that this would never happen.And lo and behold it has. Think of how happy they must feel, how relieved they must feel. They fought tooth and nail, and they've gotten there.  Earlier at this point than they may have thought they might, given what we had been hearing from Senator Ted Cruz up to just a few hours ago.I want to bring in Chris Stirewalt, who is our Fox News digital politics editor along with Tom Bevan, co-founder and publisher of RealClearPolitics.com.Guys, thank you both so much for being here. So, Stirewalt, let me start with you on what this means. I mean, the enormity of it.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: What it means is we finally have something good to talk about on primary night for a change instead of hashing through these things. Big news. This is a big deal.  And I think your point is overwhelmingly true, which is everybody said -- I remember sitting in this very building on the day that Donald Trump announced, and I said, well, you know, it's a fringe situation, and you know, these people, and it's not going to happen. What happened is he annealed a group of supporters particularly around the issue of immigration.He gathered them together around himself and they stuck with him. And while other candidates rose and other candidates fell, money comes here, money does that. This, that changes, they stayed with him. And that core group of about a third of the Republican Party proved to be enough, it was enough so that Donald trump could prevail in the end, he could outlast the world.  KELLY: Tom, as we watch the candidate come into the room, now the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, your thoughts.  TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER, REALCLEARPOLITICS: I agree with Chris. I mean, this is something -- think about this, Donald Trump did it partly any ground game, he hardly spent any money, he reinvented campaigning in a lot of these states. And so, in the end of Indiana, it was sort of a microcosm of that.  KELLY: Okay.BEVAN: You had --KELLY: Let me stand you by. I apologize but I don't want to miss his remarks. His lovely daughter Ivanka on one side who gave birth to a child, four-and-a-half weeks ago. He looks amazing. And Melania Trump on his other side, two of the closest women to him stands side by side as he makes his remarks on an important, important night for him. Let's listen.DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, thank you very much, everyone. I want to start by, as always, thanking my family, my wife Melania, my kids. They're not kids anymore, but they're kids as far as I'm concerned. They'll always be my kids. And I want to thank my great parents who are looking down right now and my brother looking down on us.  I want to thank my entire family, including Mary Anne, Elizabeth, Robert.  And it's been some unbelievable day and evening and year. And never have been through anything like this, but it's a beautiful thing to watch and a beautiful thing to behold. And we're going to make America great again.  We're going to make America great again.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)So important, so important the people of Indiana have been incredible. I started, as you know, not very long ago, about six weeks ago, and I was told I had a 20-point deficit. And I went there and I worked very hard and I campaigned and I made lots of speeches and met lots of incredible people.  Incredible people. You don't get better. And the crowds got bigger and bigger and toward the end it was like I didn't want to leave. I almost said, maybe I'll just never leave. And it resonated somehow, and we had a tremendous victory tonight. It was a tremendous victory. And I have to thank Bobby Knight. Boy, Bobby Knight was incredible.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)I always say about, you know, people like that, there aren't many, but it's called tough, smart, and they know how to win. And that's what a country needs. We have to win again. We have to know how to win, and we haven't won. We've been losing all the time. We lose with our military. We can't beat ISIS. We lose with trade. We lose with borders. We lose with everything. We're not going to lose. We're going to start winning again and we're going to win bigly, believe me.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)So when I got back tonight and I started watching all of the different networks, I could see immediately that we were doing very well, and it really looks like a massive victory and looks like we win all 57 delegates.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)And I must say in staying in various places in Indiana, we had -- I turned on the television and all I saw was negative ads, negative, one after another after another. And I called my people, and I said, how can we win?  It's just constantly. And it was the same as Florida. You know, there have been 60,000 negative ads. I got it right from you folks. Okay?  Sixty thousand. In fact, two weeks ago it was 55,000. Now it's 60,000 negative ads, most of which are absolutely false and disgusting. And I said, how can anybody endure this? I had one evening two nights ago where literally they had five ads on in between segments of a show that I was watching. And I said, that's just incredible. And the people are so smart. They don't buy it. They get it.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)And tremendous amounts of money were spent. Millions and millions of dollars. And they were comparing -- they think it was probably $8 million was spent against me, and we spent $900,000. So, I mean, to me, that's the way it's supposed to be. That's something that makes me feel really really very good. And now we're going to Nebraska where I have -- I just hear we're doing really wonderfully. I look forward to that very much. And West Virginia, and we're going to get those miners back to work, I'll tell you what.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)We're going to get those miners back to work. We're not going to be Hillary Clinton. And I watched her three or four weeks ago when she was talking about the miners as if they were just numbers and she was talking about she wants the mines closed and she will never let them work again.  Let me tell you, the miners in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, which was so great to me last week, and Ohio and all over are going to start to work again. Believe me.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)You're going to be proud again to be miners. So we'll be going there. I must say this tremendous run that we've had started with New York when we had almost 62 percent. And don't forget that's with three people. So, 62 percent with two people is a massive landslide, but 63 percent almost, just a little over 62, when you have that kind of number with three people, it's actually unheard of. And all throughout it was 17 people, then 15, then 12. And you know, it's tremendous. And we were getting very high numbers.  And some of the numbers in my opinion that I got in the early stages where I'd win a state with 32 percent but there were 14 people.I think that might be actually more and better than getting 62 percent in New York. But we never got credit for that. But now we don't need the credit because we're going after Hillary Clinton.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)She will not be a great president. She will not be a good president. She will be a poor president. She doesn't understand trade. Her husband signed perhaps in the history of the world the single worst trade deal ever done. It's called NAFTA. And I was witness to the carnage over the last six weeks especially. Now, I've known Syracuse and I've known Poughkeepsie and I've known all of the different places that I visited in New York and in Pennsylvania and in Maryland which treated me so great and the people are incredible and all of the different states, Connecticut. And I've witnessed what it's done really firsthand, and it has been indeed carnage.And we're going to change it around. We're not going to let carrier and all of these companies just think that they can move, go to another country, make their product, sell it back to us and we get only one thing.  We get unemployment. Not going to happen anymore, folks. Not going to happen anymore.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)We're going to bring back our jobs and we're going to keep our jobs. We're not going to let companies leave. Now, if they want to go to a different state, good luck. Compete. But when they start going to different countries and in many cases countries that devalue their currency and make it impossible for our companies to compete, that's not going to happen.  Not going to happen. And if they want to do it anyway, there will be consequences and there will be very, very serious consequences.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)I have to tell you that I've competed all my life, competitive person. All my life I've been in competitions, different competitions, whether it's sports or business or now for ten months politics. And I have to tell you that I have met some of the most incredible competitors that I have ever competed against right here on the Republican Party. You know, we started off with that 17 number, and just so you understand Ted Cruz, I don't know if he likes me or if he doesn't like me, but he is one hell of a competitor. He is a tough, smart guy.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)And he has got an amazing future. He's got an amazing future. So I want to congratulate Ted. And I know how tough it is. It's tough. It's tough.  I have had some moments where it was not looking so good, and it's not a great feeling. And so, I understand how Ted feels and Heidi and their whole beautiful family. And I want to just say though that one tough competitor. And I can say that for --(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)I can say that for the others. Chris Christie who endorsed me, incredible guy. Dr. Ben Carson who was right up there, one of the first, he just called me and said, it's a movement you've got going. We've got to do something because I'll tell you what, it's an incredible movement. And Dr. Ben Carson endorsed me. And I want to tell you that is an incredible man.  And we want to keep them totally involved because we're going to win.  We're going to win in November.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)And we're going to win big. And it's going to be America first. You know, I made a speech the other day and I talked about how we're the policemen for the world, how we protect other countries and they don't respect us.  And they don't take care of us. And they don't treat us right in many cases. And that's not going to happen. Now, we can keep things going and we're going to keep things going very nicely. But we owe $21 trillion soon, it's 19 now but with the budget that was recently done, soon it will be $21 trillion. And we're just not in the position that we were in 30 years ago, 40 years ago, 50 years ago when a lot of these things took place and began taking place.So, we're going to have unbelievably good relationships with other countries. But likewise, they have to treat us fairly and they have to understand that what we've been doing over the years has been so wrong and so unfair to the United States and to its people and to its taxpayers. So that will change. And I will tell you they're going to end up liking us better than they do right now. They're going to respect us. In this building right upstairs --(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)In this building right upstairs, I have the largest bank in the world from China, the relationship is fantastic. We have great relationships with many foreign countries. But they have to respect us, and they have to understand where we're coming from. And you know, it is a two-way street.  And the two-way street means that we're going down one side and they're coming up the other. And we're going to meet and we are going to have something that's going to be really fabulous. Now, if that can't happen, if for some reason they want the system to continue the way it's going now, which is unfair and not good where we're spending trillions and trillions of dollars, probably $4 trillion in the Middle East and we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our roads, we have to rebuild our bridges, our airports, our hospitals in this country, we've become close to a third world country.You look at some of our airports. It's third world. And then you go to other countries and you see places like you've never seen. So I have to say that we are going to turn it around. We're going to build up our military, bigger, better stronger than ever before. It's the cheapest thing we can do, and we're going to have to take out ISIS and we're going to have to take them out fast. We can't allow that cancer to continue.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)We cannot allow it to continue. And, you know, one group that's been so incredible to me are the vets, the veterans. And they've been treated so badly, so badly.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)And we're going to get that straightened out. Now, one of the things that just happened which to me is very exciting, just happened now with two or three, but the Rasmussen poll came out yesterday and in that poll, I'm now leading Hillary Clinton. A lot of good things happening. I'm now leading Hillary Clinton by two points.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(CHANTING TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!  TRUMP! TRUMP!)And that's going to continue because they're not going to be able to do it folks. They're not going to be able to make great trade deals. We have such bad it deals. They're not going to be able to do what we can do with the military. They're not going to be able to do what we're going to do on the border, including the wall. We're going to have unbelievably great relationships with the Hispanics. The Hispanics have been so incredible to me. They want jobs. Everybody wants jobs. The African-Americans want jobs. You look at what's going on, they want jobs.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)And we're going to bring back our jobs and we're going to save our jobs and people are going to have great jobs again. And this country which is very, very divided in so many different ways is going to become one beautiful, loving country. And we're going to love each other. We're going to cherish each other. We're going to take care of each other. And we're going to have great economic development. And we're not going to let other countries take it away from us because that's what's been happening for far too many years.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)And we're not going to do it anymore. We're not going to do it anymore. I want to thank and congratulate the Republican National Committee and Reince Priebus who I just spoke to. He's doing a tremendous job. It's not an easy job when he had 17 egos and now I guess he's down to one. I don't know. Is there a second? I don't know. Is there a second? I don't know.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)Going to have to ask you folks to explain the status of that. But he's done an amazing job. And I think we're going to see something really, really fantastic. I also want to thank my staff, Paul, Corey, Hope. I mean, these people, what we've been doing has been incredible. The work --(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)The work has been unreal. And Jared married to my daughter Ivanka, I mean, honestly, you know, Jared -- Jared is a very successful real estate person. But I actually think he likes politics more than he likes real estate. I must say to you. And he's very good at politics.So, again, folks, this has been an amazing evening. I didn't expect this. I didn't expect it. And what Ted did is really a brave thing to do and a great thing to do. Because we want to bring unity to the Republican Party. We have to bring unity. It's so much easier if we have it.(APPLAUSE)And many, many people are calling that you wouldn't even believe. The media. The press. They wouldn't believe, people who have said the worst things about me I've never had things said about me like this.You know, in my businesses I've always been very respected. People didn't talk to me this way. But in politics it's easy. The worst things. And they're calling now and they're calling us all, and they're saying, we'd love to get on the train, the Trump train, they call it. But we'd love to get on the team.  (APPLAUSE)And I actually spoke to one today who was vicious. I mean, this guy was unbelievable. And I said, I love having you, and you know, I think it's terrific. But after what you said about me, how can you possibly join our team? And he said, Mr. Trump, don't even think about it, don't worry about it, there will be no problem. In other words, he's a politician. There's no problem.(APPLAUSE)I would have had a hard time. But we have a lot of people coming, and lots of congressmen. I have to thank Jeff Sessions, Senator Jeff Sessions, one of the most respected...(APPLAUSE)... men or people in Congress. And so many others. I mean, Sarah Palin has been from day one incredible.(APPLAUSE)Jerry Falwell Jr., Liberty University, I mean, he is something. He is really a special person. They've done an incredible job. And everybody goes through Liberty. We all go through Liberty. And somehow he liked to what I was saying and perhaps he liked the way I said it. But he's a special guy, and he really has helped me. And so many pastors and ministers.And tonight, I see that I won with the Evangelicals, the Evangelical vote was for Trump.(APPLAUSE)And there's no greater honor, just no greater honor. We're going to work together for many, many years. We're going to make it so good. We're going to be saying Merry Christmas again. We're going to be saying -- now remember when...(APPLAUSE)... they are going to be saying. And I won with women. I love winning with women.(APPLAUSE)But I won with women. I won with men. We won with Hispanics. We won with African-Americans. We won every virtually every category. So, it's just been an amazing evening.So again, I want to congratulate Ted Cruz. He is a tough, smart competitor. I want to thank my wife and my family. It's an incredible family.(APPLAUSE)I want to thank my staff, both my staff and my thousands and thousands of people that work for the Trump organization.(APPLAUSE)And perhaps in all fairness, more importantly on this evening and for what we're doing currently, my staff where we're running for the presidency. And remember this, our theme is very simple. It's make America great again. We will make America great again.(APPLAUSE)We will start winning again. You will be so proud of this country very, very soon. Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Donald Trump, the presumptive republican nominee for president, at Trump tower where it all began about a year ago.Joining me now, Fox News political analyst, Brit Hume. Brit, what a moment, covering everything from we're going to say Merry Christmas again, how much he loves winning with women, and saying we're going to become one beautiful, loving country again. Your thoughts?BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it was an interesting blend there as he reached a moment many thought that he never would reach, where he is clearly the man and clearly is going to be the nominee, of blending the familiar with what maybe the new, which is the generous remarks he made about Ted Cruz.Lyin' Ted was not mentioned tonight. It was what about -- what a strong and able and smart guy with a great future Ted Cruz is. That was -- that was different from what we had heard. And his generous comments about thanking everybody, which he's done in the past.But the tone of it was clearly different. Sure the themes were there, we're going to bring back America jobs, we've been losing we're going to be winning again and all the rest of it.But what we may now, Megyn, be seeing the long awaited -- for the campaign to something new and different. And we'll see whether he's able to succeed in bringing the party that is clearly not fully behind him together.KELLY: Reince Priebus tweeting out tonight, ""Donald Trump will be presumptive GOP nominee. We all need to unite and focus on defeating Hillary."" At the same time, James Carville sends out a fund-raising e-mail seeking to raise money off of the Trump presumptive victory.Hillary herself just sent out a fund-raising tweet saying Trump is the presumptive GOP nominee, chip in now if you agree we can't let him become president.And so, what is the likely path ahead over the next seven months? I mean, I know it's tough to say with Trump, but what do you anticipate happening here, Brit?HUME: Well, he'll be under severe attack from Hillary Clinton and her democratic allies. They will point to the vagueness of his promises. They will point to the multitude of things that he has said over the years about women and about others.We will hear those repeated over and over again. He is, whether he likes it or not, a target-rich environment. And they will take dead-aim at him. And he will respond however he chooses.But I think, Megyn, the first order of business for him is to try to get to win over the balance of his party. I mean, you know, he's been rolling up majorities in recent races. But overall he is not supported by a majority of the party.Now, most of the -- many -- much of the republican vote will swing behind him, but he needs all of it. You know, Mitt Romney got 93 percent of the republican vote in 2012, and he won the independents by, what, four or five percentage points and lost the election.So, you see what Donald Trump has before him. I mean, when you get down to it, there are simply more democrats in the country than there are republicans. And the republicans have to win nearly all of their potential vote, plus, with independents by a good margin and pull over some democrats. That's the total order. He'll need to unite the party to do that.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: But was Mitt Romney winning democrats in the way that Donald Trump, we presume, might be able to?HUME: Well, we presume that. I have no doubt that a lot of Reagan democrats, so-called, working class democrats many some of these rust belt states in particular will be for him. But will that offset the deficits he now has with minority groups? That's the question.Barack Obama running on with a weak economy and I think one that would not normally lead to reelection won by cobbling together these extraordinary majorities among minority groups, African-Americans in particular, and others.And it is -- I don't think Hillary Clinton will do that as well as he did. Nearly as well. But she still will have the advantage and, you know, because he's so under water with women and all the rest of it.So, he will need to pull the party behind him and then need to find a way to withstand the attacks, which are going to be severe. Mount some of his own and it will be a come-from-behind victory. I don't think there's not much doubt about that.He's, you know, you look at the current poll willing now. He's well behind in all but this single poll he mentioned. By the way, that poll that he cited is one where you had to take away from people the opportunity -- the option of not voting at all in order to get to the majority.So, that poll will need to be confirmed to say the least. But there it is and he's got the chance.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Well, that poll, because Stirewalt says that poll doesn't contact cell phones either so it's, you know, problematic.HUME: Well, we'll see. But there it is. But it is, as I say, it is one of many and all the others say the same thing. They show Hillary leading. So, there you go. Now she's a weak candidate.KELLY: Right. With a very high unfavorable rating.HUME: She's not trusted. A very high unfavorable. It's not as high as his but very high. So, you know, she's got work to do as well.KELLY: I feel like the American people need to put on the steel armor and gird themselves for what's about to come between those two, assuming that, you know, both races work out the way we think they are going to officially. Brit, thanks so much.HUME: It won't be pretty, Megyn. Thank you.KELLY: So, Donald Trump did not get to tonight's win without a lot of resistance from some conservative circles. Remember this dramatic moment last February? National Review editors took their stand against the man who now appears to be the shoo-in.And the never Trump movement is declaring tonight that their fight is far from over. Rich Lowry is National Review editor and a Fox News contributor, Barry Bennett is also with us, he's a Trump campaign senior adviser. Great to see you both.Barry, congratulations to you on the victory of your team tonight. Rich, let me start with you, however. You, you know, famously came out with that National Review edition joined by so many conservatives, you know, two dozen, saying not Trump, no.For many different reasons, very well respected conservatives who just could not understand getting behind him as the nominee. How do you feel now?RICH LOWRY, NATIONAL REVIEW EDITOR: Well, we're disappointed. But look, first of all, I have to tip my hat to what Trump has achieved to be able to win a major party nomination in the modern era basically without having pollsters, without having speechwriters, without having a fund-raising team, with having very little organization and just going out there and doing it on gut instinct and big rallies and media interviews is completely incredible.But we do think this is a mistake for the party. We do think that Reagan- style conservatism is basically going to be in exile now in the Republican Party at least for some period of time.KELLY: So, what do you do, what does Rich Lowry and what do the other people in that never Trump edition of National Review do?LOWRY: Well, some of them are just never Trump and they are not going to vote for him no matter what. We haven't officially said that yet. We want the dust to settle and then, you know, make a very carefully considered statement.But this is going to be a bizarre election. I don't think people have really gotten their heads around it. Besides the government basically won't be an issue in this election between Trump and Hillary.Trump will, when it suits its interest, attack her from the left and attack her from the right. We're going to have a republican presidential nominee attacking Hillary Clinton for her Iraq war vote from the left.You're going to have -- one reason, you know, Bernie Sanders pushed Hillary to the left on the trade and social security, and she's not going to come back in the center in a general election because Trump would attack her from the left on those issues as well.So, this is a completely different republican nominee than we've seen in decades and decades.KELLY: And, Barry, that's not what he said is not wrong, right? I mean, that's the sort of asymmetrical game that Trump plays which can keep his adversaries so off kilter.BARRY BENNETT, TRUMP CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER: Yes, I mean, it's politics 2.0 for sure. You know, but it struck a chord with millions and millions of Americans. It's the right bundling of issues and message, and, you know, I mean, Rich, we want your vote. We want all of your votes. We're happy to sit down with you if it's possible.But, you know, we're going to fight a battle in the fall that unlike any battle we've seen before. But we're going to win because we're up against a 30-year incumbent, and we all believe that Washington needs to be bulldozed and started fresh.KELLY: What do you say, Barry, because I read it on the air earlier. Former McCain adviser coming out and saying, I don' -- I don't care, I'm not going to be supporting him because I think he would be reckless. And speaking to the temperament issue that we've seen with Trump in the past?BENNETT: Yes.KELLY: The very issue that helped propel him to tonight's victory, but there is, you would concede, a question about whether that same -- whether that temperament could do the same for him when he's trying to appeal to more than just republicans?BENNETT: You know, when McCain became our nominee I was one of the people who publicly said, I'll never vote for him. But by the time we got to the fall, you know, I wrote him a check and I voted for him because it was important.And I expect a lot of these people -- I mean, I don't expect it tonight. I don't expect it tomorrow, I don't expect it this month. But as we go through the fall, a lot of these people are going to do everything they can to help us defeat Hillary. And that's all we ask.KELLY: We're taking a look at Donald Trump Jr. there speaking with a reporter who we cannot see and then a cameraman in an enormous green shirt.At first I had no idea what we were seeing. Now it's more clear to me. A very happy night for the Trump family, all of whom have worked so hard on behalf of their dad. And that's one thing you cannot say about Donald Trump, that he hasn't raised a great family. He's got great kids and they speak very well of him.But, Rich, the question is what this means now for republicanism, for the Republican Party and whether this party will ever look the same after tonight.LOWRY: Well, what Trump has exposed is the current pieties in the Republican Party weren't as strong as we thought. Everyone thought you had to go out there, you had to every day talk about Ronald Reagan, talk about his example, talk about his policies, repeat his rhetorical tropes all the time about a shining city on the hill and all the rest of it.Trump did none of that, and he went out and sold a nationalism and populism to republican voters, and republican voters were just angry enough with Washington, just sick enough with the status quo and the establishment that it worked.And you know, one element that became clear over time is that every time he said something outrageous it helped him because it reinforced his brand as something new and different.But, Megyn, you alluded to, you know, a lot of folks have real concerns about his character and temperament. And, Barry, I would ask you, why on a day when he's going to win the Indiana primary very likely and he's very likely going to wrap up the republican nomination, why is he out there talking about Ted Cruz's dad being in on the Kennedy assassination? That's the kind of thing that sort of makes people's head explode and makes them wonder what this guy is thinking.KELLY: Go ahead, Barry.BENNETT: You know, Ted Cruz had a press conference at 11.30 this morning. That was far more vitriolic.KELLY: Yes. But Trump said that on Fox and Friends, which is before 11 o'clock this morning.BENNETT: That's what I'm saying. But Ted Cruz was still doing it at 11.30 today and then he withdrew at 8 o'clock tonight. You know, the campaign is over. The primaries are over.KELLY: You know, but speak to his point because somebody else raised that earlier tonight and Trump hasn't had a defense on that. Why would he do that when he was -- he was polling 10, 15 points ahead in Indiana before we started the day.You know, it was looking very much in his favor. And a lot of folks said, wait a minute, we've been through three weeks now where Trump was behaving more presidentially. Why, you know, could he be depended on to keep that going?BENNETT: You know, I don't think he was going to -- he's not going to let up in a 100-yard dash. He's going to run through the tape. And so, that's what he was doing. And Ted Cruz did the same thing. And I admire them both for it. They both knew the handwriting was on the wall and they both played to the end of the game...(CROSSTALK)LOWRY: But, Barry, I understand -- I understand fighting hard. Obviously there's nothing wrong with that politics is not beanbags. But accusing someone's father of being party in some sense in the Kennedy assassination seems way over the line based on a completely ridiculous report in the National Enquirer.BENNETT: This is over. This is over. You know what, the reason Ronald Reagan -- I worked on the Reagan campaign and I think you did too.(CROSSTALK)LOWRY: So, you're trying to take it back or apologize...KELLY: Hold on, hold on. Barry, make your point. Then, Rich, you can respond.BENNETT: Rich, I think -- I worked on the Reagan campaign and I think you did, too, rich. But, you know, when Ronald...(CROSSTALK)LOWRY: No, I never worked on a political campaign.BENNETT: OK, sorry about that. But Ronald Reagan won because he led people who were hurting. That's exactly what Donald Trump is going to do.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Go ahead, Rich.LOWRY: No, I get that. But wouldn't he if he wants to unite the party, why wouldn't he go back and say, look, there is no evidence Senator Cruz that your father was part of the Kennedy assassination? I should have said that. I apologize.BENNETT: There's no need to. Now the primary is over.KELLY: OK. Let's leave it that. And clearly we don't have party unity yet. But, you know, it's the first night and so you never know. Guys, thank you very much.I want to take a listen here to Donald J. Trump Jr. giving some remarks just a minute ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP JR., DONALD TRUMP'S SON: I was. I was there with him. It was Vanessa, Ivanka, Jared, Eric, Laura, the whole family was just there. Sitting on his bed watching his TV, you know. Saw some hints maybe on social media, and then, and when it happened I think it was just sort of a collective wow.I don't think there were a lot of words spoken. I think we're just incredibly shocked. I mean, it's been a long and brutal process, one that's been very tough and on that, you know, we weren't familiar with.I mean, so it's just incredible to see him step into this game as an outsider and do so well and give the people a voice. It's just been awesome.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And do you think he and Ted Cruz will speak at some point, I assume Donald would speak and see him.TRUMP JR.: I'm sure they will.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And do you think that it's possible for your father to unite this party? It's pretty fractured right now.TRUMP JR.: You know, I think the answer is 100 percent. I mean, I think people get it. You know, obviously there's been a lot of protecting the system with a lot of the old-school establishment. And you know, I understand that.But I think a big part of my father's message is letting the people have a voice, giving them that voice again and letting it be heard. And it's spoken loud and clear. And I think, you know, our politicians on both sides have to start actually listening to the people for a change.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And did you ever think your dad (Inaudible).TRUMP JR.: Listen, I've learned never to second-guess him. I mean, I think we obviously know it was sort of -- you know, it would have to almost be an anomaly. But he's a special guy, and he's an incredible person. He understands these things. He gets it.I think I want somebody to lead this country who has actually signed in front of a paycheck, who's employed tens of thousands of people, whose livelihoods depend on his success. That's like...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you handle this for a month at least.TRUMP JR.: You know, I think we don't have a choice, right? I think we're in it now. So, we're all in.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How will he run the call?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Will you be thinking a bigger role in the campaign going forward?TRUMP JR.: We'll see. If he wants me to, I'm happy to do it. I think, you know, it's the least I could do. I'd love to do it for the country if it helps.(PFF-MIKE)TRUMP JR.: Work. If there's one thing you'll always see with us we'll work with. We're going to make this happen. We're going to push hard and we'll never going to give up. Thank you, guys.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: From your perspective is this the hardest thing your father has ever accomplished?TRUMP JR.: I think if you ask him, he thought real estate and business was a brutal process at times and this is worse. It is incredibly tough, it is incredibly brutal. But again, when you have the people behind you they would have to be...(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: And there you heard it, it would have to be. One of the hardest things that he has ever accomplished and work, indeed, they will have to. Because while this republican nomination contest is effectively over tonight and Donald Trump has secured this nomination all but John Kasich remains.He will have a fight ahead of him. Hillary Clinton will unleash everything she has and is already fundraising off of what we have seen this evening.Joining me now is Katie Pavlich, she is a townhall.com news editor and Fox News contributor, and Scott Brown, who's is a former Massachusetts Senator and Donald Trump supporter.Senator, Katie, great to see you. Senator, congratulations on the victory of your candidate tonight. Let me start with this, which is just come in from John Kasich's chief strategist who says, ""Until someone has 1237 bound delegates there is no presumptive nominee. California, here we come."" Your thoughts?SCOTT BROWN, FORMER MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR: Listen, I like John Kasich. I have a lot of respect for him, but if he thinks he is going to be vice president, if he thinks this is going to help, it's not. I don't think that Donald is going to focus on him at all. Is he going to shift gears to not only raise money but also raise awareness and try to unite the party and focus on Hillary Clinton.You have already seen the barrage from Hillary and her team. You have two people running that have very high negatives. The difference is I think Donald can improve his. I think hers are more in stone.KELLY: Katie, I'm very curious as to what you think. You have you been never Trump. And, you know, you heard him tonight talking about how he won tonight with women. I love winning with women, which was an interesting comment. Your thoughts on whether he -- could he win with this woman right here in the blue?KATIE PAVLICH, TOWNHALL.COM NEWS EDITOR: I think that he has a lot of work to do. Not only with women in the electorate but also with women in his own party. That he has decided to do run for president in that party.There is a lot of people tonight who feel very disappointed. They give credit to Donald Trump for doing something that no one has ever done. However, there is a lot of conservatives who feel they do not share any conservative values with Donald Trump. From everything from healthcare to the way the government functions and what the role of government really is and how our constitutional system works. And so he has a lot of work to do to shore up that conservative vote.KELLY: You know...BROWN: Hey, Megyn?KELLY: Yes. Go ahead, Senator.BROWN: Megyn, and that's a great point. Listen, Ted ran a great race. And now he has to make a decision whether he wants to help in that effort to bring that conservatism into the Trump fold, to be there as a sounding board to help, you know, push him along in that way.It's not all of a sudden he is the president and then no one else does anything. Ted has an opportunity and so do all the conservatives to come in and bring those ideas.KELLY: But what does he do?PAVLICH: That's a lot to ask.KELLY: Go ahead. Sorry, Katie, go ahead.BROWN: Well, listen, so is our losing our country to the four more years of Hillary Clinton with all due respect. Four more years.KELLY: Hold on, let her make a point. Go ahead, Katie.PAVLICH: With all due respect, Senator.BROWN: Yes.PAVLICH: It's a lot to ask when you have a candidate who just this week said that he basically doesn't need the conservative voters who don't -- who didn't cast their vote for him in the primary. It's a lot to ask for conservative voters to vote for someone who is significantly supported nationalized healthcare system. It's a lot to ask for conservatives.(CROSSTALK)BROWN: Look, Katie, listen.PAVLICH: Pease don't interrupt me, Senator.KELLY: Hold on.PAVLICH: Senator, please don't interrupt me, let me finish. Senator, please don't interrupt me.KELLY: Hold on.PAVLICH: Let me make my point.KELLY: Irritating to viewers, it's irritating to the viewers when you talk over each other. Katie, finish your point and then I'll give you the floor, Senator Brown.PAVLICH: Please, don't interrupt me.BROWN: Thank you.PAVLICH: It's a lot to ask when you have just today...BROWN: OK.PAVLICH: ... Donald Trump accusing Ted Cruz's father of essentially being part of the JFK assassination. And then later changing his tune and saying that Ted Cruz is a beautiful family and is he a stand-up guy.So, he has a lot of work to do. And votes are earned. Donald Trump is not entitle to do the votes of conservatives. So, I look forward to seeing what work he is going to do to bring them into his camp.KELLY: Go ahead, sir.BROWN: Great, Katie, great talking points but this is reality. We have a situation right now where it's either going to be Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. And the conservatives have an opportunity...(CROSSTALK)PAVLICH: Who Trump gave money to.BROWN: Well, let me finish now. And we have an opportunity now to actually bring in the conservatives, unite this party, take back the White House, get the cabinet positions, the judicial positions, the ambassadors, having the vice president come in and actually potentially be that deciding vote.That's the choice, period. And I'm hopeful that he will pick a vice president that will make your conservative wing of your party very happy. And that we can unite this party and put that genie back into the bottle. That's the choice, Katie. And I have a lot of respect for you as well, but that's the choice. And we have to make sure that we unite the party.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Can I ask you, Senator. Let me ask to her point. I want to ask you as a Trump defender to her point how does he do it? If you are going to advice Donald Trump...(CROSSTALK)BROWN: I'm a Trump supporter. I'm not a Trump...KELLY: Yes, supporter. But so, if you were going to advise him, OK, now you have got win the women back, right?BROWN: Yes, sure.KELLY: You have got to get more women. You cannot win the presidency with 72 percent of women not supporting you. You've got to win some Hispanics back over. You've got to win some young people back into the tent.BROWN: Sure. Sure.KELLY: How? What is your advice to him?BROWN: Well, first of all, Hillary Clinton is the same thing with men. So you have -- it's almost a wash, but I would advise him to get his surrogates. Get his family, get his female employees, the executives, to fill and prop that helped not only women but Hispanics.Get them out there and have them start advocating as you are starting to see. This process as has said earlier, Rich Lowry has just said. It has been a long and brutal process unlike anything we've ever seen. And you are going to have a lot of hard feelings.We have a chance to actually get back on track and unite behind our nominee and take back the presidency or we can have four to eight more years of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. That's the choice.KELLY: OK.BROWN: So, I know it's an ugly choice for some people, but what's the choice.KELLY: I'm going to -- thank you very much. I appreciate both of you being here.PAVLICH: Thanks, Megyn.BROWN: All right. Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: Despite the back and forth because Senator Cruz and Donald Trump today, here was how Donald Trump spoke about Ted Cruz just moments ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I have to tell you that I've competed all my life, competitive person. All my life I've been in competitions. Different competitions. Whether it's sports or business or now for 10 months, politics.And I have to tell you that I have met some of the most incredible competitors that I have ever competed against right here on the Republican Party. You know, we started off with that 17 number.And just so you understand, Ted Cruz, I don't know if he likes me or if he doesn't like me. But he is he one hell of a competitor. He is a tough, smart guy.(APPLAUSE)I want to thank and congratulate the Republican National Committee and Reince Priebus who I just spoke to. He is doing a tremendous job. It's not an easy job. I think we are going to see something really, really fantastic.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, Dana Loesch, host of ""Dana"" on the Blaze TV and author of ""Hands off My Gun."" Dana, good to see you.DANA LOESCH, BLAZE TV HOST: Thank you.KELLY: Now we are learning that Senator Cruz will go back to Houston tonight to be at home with his family. This was obviously disappointment to you. You were a Ted Cruz supporter.You know, put in perspective, Donald Trump had a very different message by the end of the day about Ted Cruz than he did at the beginning, which to some extent to be expected. They are competitors in the morning, they are not now.Do you think that Ted Cruz needs to push to get those who supported him all those delegates who voted for him and who he corralled through that, you know, effort he put in so many states to get behind Donald Trump?LOESCH: Well, you know, Megyn, politics, I feel like saying Kanye 2020 right now, by the way, just to get that out of my system. I mean, 2020. No, but politics is a weird game. And it's funny that you bring that up.Because just this morning he was spinning this yarn that Rafael Cruz was somehow involved in JFK's assassination. And now the Trump camp is kind of suggesting and some of the people at this camp are saying, well, you know, Ted Cruz, now you have to -- you have to bring unity.It's not Ted Cruz's responsibility to bring unity. It's the republican nominee's responsibility to bring unity. And he needs to really rethink how he is approaching things and so does his supporters.Because it's kind of hard to unify with people who just call you a conservative and all of that stuff. It just doesn't make you feel liek unifying.KELLY: That's an interesting point because it's been such a brutal primary season and a lot of sharp elbows were thrown.LOESCH: Right.KELLY: Let's be honest, more sharp than we've seen in recent history. And many republicans and conservatives were very much alienated by the tactics Trump successfully used to get himself to this point.So, what of that? Do you think Trump needs to do something more than just sort of say we've got to unite? It's going to be beautiful. We have got to beat Hillary?LOESCH: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, my goodness. Yes. I mean, Megyn, this is where I'm coming from. Now I started in all of this getting involved in grassroots back in 2008. And when we were out in the street, protesting the republican establishment, and I have to note he did fund them. And that's not, you know, arguable. It's just what happened.He's got to get over that hurdle because there are a lot of people out there like me that are scratching their heads thinking the establishment is still there. Mitch McConnell, still there. Lindsey Graham, still there.And we feel as though, a lot of conservatives feel as though the ones who are doing the grassroots stuff back in '09, feels as though, like all of a sudden now we're being attacked because we preferred somebody else in the primary.And that belligerent, that belligerent kind of approach...KELLY: Yes.LOESCH: ... maybe it works against other, you know, candidates in a primary. But it doesn't work with conservative activists, Megyn.KELLY: Who he definitely needs working on his behalf or at least to certainly be helpful to him.LOESCH; Right.KELLY: Dana, it's great to see you.LOESCH: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: Thanks for being here. What a night, folks. Love to get your thoughts on the evening. Go to facebook.com/thekellyfile. Follow me on Twitter @megynkelly, tell me what you think. Thanks for watching. I'm Megyn Kelly.

This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" October 7, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone, I'm Eric Bolling along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld, today is a very special day for the Fox News Channel. It's our 20th anniversary and we're going to commemorate that major milestone later in this hour. But first, a Fox News alert. Winds have weaken a little bit down to a Category 2 hurricane, but Hurricane Matthew is still an extremely dangerous -- Category 2 storm whipping up Florida's east coast. The death toll there has now risen to four. Georgia and South Carolina are bracing for impact, the eye of Matthew remains offshore, but there is extreme concern about the winds and the storm surge pushing off against the (inaudible) coastline. St. Augustine has been among the hardest hit. This amateur video shows people trapped at a hotel at the heart of that city.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you called for help? Have you called for help? How many, how many kids are in there?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (inaudible).UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Twenty?(CROSSTALK)(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Hurricane Matthew has killed hundreds in the Caribbean, writers has now reporting the death toll in Haiti has risen to a more than 800, the reporters (inaudible) along Florida's east coast. We're also going to get an update from Rick Reichmuth at the Fox Weather Center, but we're going to begin with Leland Vittert live in Daytona Beach. Leland, tell us about the storm.LELAND VITTERT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Eric, 24 hours ago, a lot has changed and that's when the police chief here said it wasn't a matter of if, but when, someone would die in this storm, in his city, and sadly, that has happened. Woman who went out to feed her animals around noon, right in the height of the storm, died when a tree fell on her, and that is just how dangerous, how random this storm to be. During hurricanes, we talked a lot about the damage, the wind damages in specific. And you look behind me, one of the boardwalks here at Daytona Beach, the tourist shops not really significant damage. Significant if you own one of these stores, not significant, though, overall. You get a sense here as you look down at the ocean. Number one, the power that this storm produced, but number two, also, just how high up the storm came. You see where the concrete trashcan that was lifted up and moved off one of the sidewalks, and then right here, sort of a waterline where the water reached. Given how it was on the other side of this hill, it will stand a reason it had this storm surge even been one of two feet higher. It would about a much bigger affect there, farther inland. That didn't happen. Many folks saying, ""We didn't necessarily dodge a bullet entirely, but certainly at least in fear in Volusia County not nearly as bad as expected."" Flooding is still a problem, but not the sort of overwhelming effect that everyone prepared for, guys.BOLLING: All right, Dana has a question.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Well Leland, I was curious because some of the local officials and state officials have been saying the worst could still be yet to come. Are they not talking about Florida any longer, they're talking about further up north in Georgia and South Carolina?VITTERT: Well Dana, the state officials are saying this for a couple of reason. We're going to walk down. I'll talk about why that is. They keep saying here that they really want people -- number one, not to take anything for granted. So they're getting -- where happening right now, the sort of -- counterclockwise, pardon me, winds that are now coming back around, so it's still fairly dangerous to be out on the street, especially if you don't have the proper gear if you're not really set-up to be in one of this situation. Also, number two, worst is yet to come because of the storm surge, still possible to get more storm surge. We saw that really after the worst winds down in Daytona Beach. We saw storm surge coming in, in flooding. The other issue is, is what happens in north Florida, the contour, the Gold Coast is very different as you go farther north and up in the Atlantic. It's much lower in terms of how the coast is dealt with. And also, the way the island are shaped, a lot of the water from the storm surge can comeback around, and that's really what they're worried about now, North Florida into Georgia to the lowlands of South Carolina -- in those places, Dana.BOLLING: Greg has one.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hey, Leland. I'm just wondering when I'm looking at you, you're out there all alone. I'm just wondering if the only people there right now are reporters.VITTERT: Right, guys. You may be asking me a question. It appears that I've lost your connection. We're doing our best to establish it out here, as you might imagine during the hurricane and during the sort of the aftermath of the hurricane, cell phones that we used to communicate. Back with you guys and be able to hear what you're asking us, tend to be somewhat unreliable and shockingly enough, iPhones don't really love the rain, it's been coming down in the drench pocket. So, with that, we'll it back to you guys and wait to hear -- we'll talk to you a little bit later in the show and show you some of the more damage here in Daytona Beach. Back to you.BOLLING: Very good, Leland. Thank you very much. We'll check back with you a little bit later on the show. Let's go now to our chief meteorologist, Rick Reichmuth, tracking the storm in Fox Weather Center. Rick, where is it headed?RICK REICHMUTH, CHIEF METEOROLOGIST: It's headed to the north now. Winds have come down a little bit that come to a Category 2, the high in Category 2 at a hundred and ten. But that pressure of the 948, meteorological terms, that still really, really, low pressure. So still a very, very strong storm, but it is hard to coastline, we talked of the last number of days, exactly where it goes on that coastline, it's going to have really big impact. The worst of the wind, the worst of it was just offshore, and you saw this couple of little (inaudible) here, this is all about 25 miles offshore, had that been a little bit closer, certainly would have been worst, at least as part of the storm surge and the wind. But we've obvious to seen a lot of damage. We have a long ways to go, storm still pulling a lot of that energy and the storm surge, and so this kind of a concave area here along the coastline that Leland was just talking about. You also noticed the kind of that coastline, that little jugged shape, it's a lot of (inaudible) a lot of kind of swamp and rivers and inlets, and that's why we were gonna continue to see that storm surge pile in here and continue to flood. The center of the storm right now is about the center, about 45 miles from the coast, but the wall that, where we still have the very strong winds is only about 15 to 20 miles off the shore there. Let's see, not sure why that map, just pop up -- let me show you this. Hurricane warnings in effect here now including areas of North Carolina, and the latest track looks like it's going to a little farther off towards the east before it makes the inaudible). And because of that, as it goes north, Charleston, South Carolina potentially, you notice the center of that really flirting there with the coastline. So we go into tomorrow morning, tomorrow afternoon, Sunday afternoon and we still have a lot of impacts, a lot of time with the hurricane right there flirting with the coast. So a lot of areas are going to deal with this before it moves back to the south. Don't worry about this, when it comes back to the south it will be kind of a shadow of its former self. This right here is the storm surge still probably 8 to 12, Savannah up towards Charleston, beautiful area and we're going to be watching a big storm surge that is likely going to cause a lot of flooding. One last thing guys, I want to show you the rainfall amounts are going to be extreme. You seem a lot of rain in Florida, but we will see it become more of a rain event as it starts to interact with the front as it off towards the west as it get into the Carolinas and look at this, we're going to see some spots, 15 inches even now going up into eastern Virginia. Juan, you used to talk -- yesterday asked me about Virginia, but I think eastern Virginia in Norfolk, we're gonna be talking about some pretty significant rain, and that means quite a little bit of flooding.BOLLING: All right, hang on, KG has a question.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Hi, Rick. So, in terms of the expectation level where people were projecting, you know, for this hurricane, where do you think it's basically plays itself out in that sense?REICHMUTH: Like was the forecast accurate? Is that what you mean?GUILFOYLE: Yeah.REICHMUTH: Yeah, I think it's been pretty spot on, we've set all along that little 20 miles, one way or another, we couldn't say, but the overall behavior of it, of it is run just right parallel to the coast and it continues to do so. So I think what we've seen with the damage in Florida, what I think we have yet to see by tomorrow morning of what happens here in Georgia and South Carolina is going to continue to be very extreme and a really dangerous night ahead, again, across the areas of Georgia and into South Carolina and we have a lot of flooding going on right now in Jacksonville, as well. One last thing I got to tell you, we had record breaking flooding across areas of the eastern North Carolina, a couple of weeks ago. That means the ground is incredibly saturated, and if we get those spots that maybe getting that 12 to 10 -- 10 to 12 inches of rain up there by the time we get to Sunday, we're going to have a massive flooding event going on across parts of North Carolina as well.BOLLING: All right, Rick. I think if you think back, you look at Hurricane Katrina took a direct hit .REICHMUTH: Yeah.BOLLING: . towards New Orleans, also Hurricane Sandy came directly westward .REICHMUTH: Yup.BOLLING: . into the, into the coast and that caused a lot of the damage. We're going to leave it right there.REICHMUTH: Yeah.BOLLING: Thank you very much, Rick. We gonna now to Bryan Llenas in Sebastian, Florida. Now Bryan, what's the latest there? You look like -- it looks like it's not too shabby there right now.BRYAN LLENAS, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well let's talk about what Rick was talking about which is that any 20 miles to the west and this storm could have been a lot worse for central and south Florida. Right behind me we have beautiful homes, right? We are on A1A. Well, if we have my cameraman come behind him, you'll see that those homes would have been damaged, had the Category 4 hurricane made the 20 miles to west. But right across the street you see the damage here, this is piers, right? You got the jet skis and cruise from the piers and the broken piers out here, the kayaks and boats that have been lifted from the forest. This is the Indian River. Behind those homes I had shown you, that was the Atlantic Ocean, because that's storm did not hit here in south and central Florida, the way that they believed and how it's really hitting in Daytona and Jacksonville with that kind of severity, well that's why people here in south, in central Florida are right now breathing a sigh of relief. We have about a million people without power and there are plenty people without power here, especially in central Florida right now. But besides that, again, we've had four deaths to the storm and those deaths have come sadly. One, you know, two people that had a generator in the garage, another woman who had a heart attack and emergency services couldn't get to her and another woman who had a fallen tree that hit her, unfortunately, but all in all for central and south Florida, unlike what's happening in Jacksonville and St. Augustine. People expected a really serious, serious storm and right now the damage is minimal with fallen trees and little bit of, you know, puddles and that kind of a thing, thankfully. Eric?BOLLING: All right. Thanks, Bryan. The low lying city of Jacksonville, Florida is bracing for a tremendous amounts of flooding, as Matthew takes into a north. Garrett Tenney is there now and he joins us live. Garrett?GARRETT TENNEY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Eric. We're talking earlier about, about the worst is yet to come. Jacksonville is where they were talking about. Right now you can see we're just starting to feel the full brunt of Hurricane Matthew here and it's going to stay this way for at least the next three hours. The biggest concern, because Jacksonville is such a low lying area, is the storm surge. This is the St. John's River. Right now if this raises up another foot 1/2, that is going to be clear covering this entire boardwalk here along the shore, already a Jacksonville Beach about 15 miles from here. The first 2 1/2, three blocks of that town are entirely flooded. So the worst is yet to come here in Jacksonville where we be keeping a close eye on the developments over the next three hours. Eric?BOLLING: All right, Garrett, thank you very much. We're going to be monitoring Hurricane Matthew throughout the hour, but we turn to the presidential race next. There's only two days left before the next presidential debate, our predictions and our advice for both candidates ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Welcome back. This Sunday is the next presidential debate. Hillary Clinton's off the trail today, but Donald trump took part in a round table this afternoon and a town hall last night. Here's what he said there.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Donald Trump is going to New Hampshire to practice for Sunday. This has nothing to do with Sunday, and it's like -- they make you into a child. And this has --I love the people of New Hampshire. And this was set up a little while ago, they were going to cancel it and I said why do you cancel it? What do you want a debate prep? I said, forget debate prep. I mean, give me a break. Do you really think that Hillary Clinton is debate prepping for three or four days? Hillary Clinton is resting, OK? She's resting --(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: We've got a live show this Sunday, a few hours before the second showdown. So please, make sure to tune in and watch ""The Five"" at 5:00 p.m. More now on what we can expect at this weekend's face off and right off the bat as we were going on near ""The Washington Post,"" posted a story that's about a tape of Donald Trump talking with Billy Bush as they were doing a show and apparently, Donald Trump is in his private van or whatever with, and they're talking about women in the most derogatory of ways, using language that we can't repeat here for you. So, let me ask Eric. What do you think of this as how is this going to affect --BOLLING: We have a live show Sunday?(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: That sound --BOLLING: That will be great. That will be great.GUILFOYLE: That sounded like .WILLIAMS: You don't, you don't want to talk about this.BOLLING: That is so much fun. I look forward to come on Sunday.GUILFOYLE: That sounded like an invitation to a funeral. It was like --BOLLING: So look, yeah. I listened to the tape and look, Donald, obviously heard it. He came out. He apologized immediately, says it was a locker-room banter and made an apology if he's offended. And it's, I guess that's all you can really do and you can -- that's all you can really hope for.WILLIAMS: But now I say in terms of debate, so do you think this - the women's issue is back?BOLLING: Well, I think it she'd -- Hillary will try and you know, remember what she did with miss -- what was it, Machado?PERINO: Alicia Machado.BOLLING: Machado. Yeah. Ms. Machado. She -- that she wasn't even asked that question, but she somehow worked it in. So I'm, I'm guessing, they're figuring out right now how they can take a question that may have something to do, similar, grab it and somehow (inaudible) -- it's going to be tough, though. I, I mean --WILLIAMS: OK.BOLLING: Yeah, it's not, it's not fun listening to that.WILLIAMS: Kimberly?GUILFOYLE: Yeah. I mean, obviously -- it's the women's issue and that discussion has never been off the table. This has remained the constant throughout this campaign and election. I think issuing a statement right away was imperative. So, you know, it's obviously not a positive story, that's for sure. So we're going to have to see where it goes from here.WILLIAMS: Let's talk about the politics in the debate Dana. What do you see?PERINO: Well, I think that -- first of all in his statement he doesn't apologize for saying it, he apologize as if you were offended, which is not the same as apologizing for something that you did.GUTFELD: I've tried that. It doesn't work.PERINO: It's tried all the time.GUILFOYLE: Then Dana had a (inaudible) right? (inaudible), remember?PERINO: And the thing about this is that -- I have, I can understand -- I hear him. He's saying it was a locker-room banter, private conversation. Did not expect that it was on a hot mic, it was within 2005. But culture has moved on. And one of the things you see in this election, repeatedly, and you'll see more tonight when the fresh polls come out is that Donald Trump trails with women by a huge margin. He's not doing as well with men as he needs to be. So there are just -- these are points in the campaign when there's no room for error. And when it comes to the debate prep, I think, that was -- he praised Governor Pence for his debate performance for good reason. And Pence basically shut himself away with Governor Scott Walker and they practiced for that debate for days. It does pay off to debate -- to practice, and I do believe that Hillary Clinton is not resting. I think that she is making her team put her through her paces over and over again to see how she can, at least try to not flail at this debate and to try to seem whatever it is that people want from her likeable (inaudible). The last thing I would say on this statement from him today if you go to ""The Washington Post"" page and you listen to it, is that it goes back to this issue -- it's not just with women, it's the issue of temperament and judgment. And over and over again, the numbers are flipped in terms of temperament and judgment if that's what you care about when you're voting for a president. It's a difficult thing for him, so it has never welcomed. But I do think that, unlike other times in campaign -- in the campaign where they've been -- they had to deal with adversity. Donald Trump's quick reaction to this was better than in the past.WILLIAMS: So, Greg, you and I are so expert at dealing with women. I thought I would ask you. Donald Trump said last time after the first debate that he held back.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: . he didn't bring up Bill Clinton's problems with women because he was in -- he thought it might embarrass Chelsea and Hillary.GUTFELD: Right. I think he still --WILLIAMS: Does he thinks he's gonna bring it up now?GUTFELD: I think he will now. I think because is, this is going to be full board misogyny, accusations against Donald Trump. Hillary will bring this up and its only defense is going to be using Bill Clinton. So look at your husband. That's the only place he can go with this because he's got -- he's up, kind of up against the law when you're on tape. The thing about the town hall thing, you know, it only had Trump supporters. He continues to retreat into comfort zones instead of going out there and putting himself out there for practice. I mean there were more softballs in that town hall than the bushes at your local park. Meanwhile, she's like lined up, I don't know how many Trump impersonators that throw paintballs at her and she's like, she's actually, you know, prepared and it's like he said, he thought Pence did a great job. Why did Pence do a great job?WILLIAMS: Well, so let's go -- let's runt through this for the audience, because they may be interested to know that Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee has been in Donald Trump's sessions and apparently he's throwing questions at Donald Trump. Chris Christie is playing the antagonist. I don't know how Chris Christie plays Hillary Clinton. And they're also trying to talk to Trump, Kellyanne Conway, about body language and how he deals with the fact that the questions are coming from the audience, as well as from the two moderators.GUTFELD: My prediction is it's going to be a war over who's more folksy. Hillary is going to try to out-folks the Trump, because he likes to amble around, so she's gonna amble around like a friendly farmer from up the road.PERINO: Oh. I think she, she should cut any canned line from her performance. The canned lines from Kaine were not good in that earlier debate.GUILFOYLE: Disastrous. Yeah, not good. I mean, look. Obviously, she's preparing because she prepared last time and it worked well for her, but now it's gonna also be about personality, and so in terms of her reliability and people liking her, she's not been able to do well with that. People say, you know, if you know her personally they find her likable but it's not translating, it's not resonating through the screen and in these groups. Perhaps, this will give her an opportunity to try and showcase that if it is there to find it somewhere deep down. Trump, he seems very comfortable, I think in this kind of format, just from the signal, the town hall that he's done, maybe this is gonna be able a little bit of an advantage for him to try and showcase.WILLIAMS: All right.GUTFELD: Problem is it that this is not the same kind of town hall. That was, that was not a dry run. That was a no run, you know, there was no conflict.WILLIAMS: Yeah, those were all Trump supporters .GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: . and the questions were prescreened, so --GUTFELD: Yeah.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: All right, don't forget to watch us Sunday at 5:00 p.m. A quick break now and then we've got a new bomb shell on the Clinton e-mail scandal to tell you about. How the White House tried to help Hillary Clinton contain the scandal. Next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Welcome back to ""The Five."" Hurricane Matthew is turning up the coast of Florida, still an extremely dangerous storm that's weakened slightly to a Category 2 storm. Officials in Georgia and South Carolina are warning its coastal residents to flee now before Matthew makes his way there. We'll have an update for you shortly. There will be live reporters on the ground that we'll talk to. But we turn now to politics again. There's news on the Clinton e-mail controversy, (inaudible) said, this is actually news that just -- the heats keep coming. E-mails obtain by the RNC, through a FOIA request indicate that the White House was working with the State Department and the Clinton campaign to manage and minimize the fallout over the secretary's private server back in early 2015. An administration official issued this statement to Fox News today. ""The administration has always been transparent about the fact that we were in touch with the Clinton campaign about stories related to her time at the State Department."" Which I have to say, given the story, I -- I buy that, when I look at some of these e-mails I see the communications team at the White House and the State Department coordinating as they do. And the reason that the e-mails are public is because the RNC Eric asked for these e-mails based on a freedom of information request. They got them. In one way you could look at it and say looks like they're colluding to try to protect Hillary, even though she had this server, which was -- one of the things President Obama said that there was no wrong doing, but they were early on recognizing that this was going to be a bad story for them.BOLLING: And my issue with is, is that they discuss how they're going to spin it to the media. So the White House is coordinating with the campaign and saying, hey, you see, what are we doing with CBS? Are they OK? Yeah, we're doing good with them. Or what about the other group or Steve Harvey sending the coordination and then -- it's just -- I don't -- if it's not illegal, it certainly should be unethical.WILLIAMS: But it's not illegal and .PERINO: Yeah.WILLIAMS: . there was no campaign. We're talking about .PERINO: That's right.WILLIAMS: . the State Department and the White House. And so you had now -- what's interesting, and I think would --PERINO: I mean they knew she was going to announce her presidency.WILLIAMS: So that your purpose is that you have Jennifer Palmieri .BOLLING: Yeah.WILLIAMS: . who was at the White House at the time and then she goes over later to, work for Hillary Clinton's campaign.BOLLING: Right.WILLIAMS: And you have Jen Psaki who was at the State Department at the time. She later goes to the White House and they're communicating about whether or not they can avoid having the current secretary of state. Hillary Clinton's success of John Kerry ask questions during a CBS interview and it's not clear but it looks like they finally come to a decision that, oh yes, CBS is not going to ask about this which suggests that, gee, that CBS, they will avoid this. Well CBS today, puts out a stamen saying, ""No, we've never bought into saying anything was off the table."" The second part of it is, and maybe the more troubling to me is, you see the State Department assuring a lawyer who worked for Mrs. Clinton that the State Department's not telling Congress that Mrs. Clinton did anything wrong. And I don't know how they can know that with that juncture, but clearly they're in touch with the lawyers early on.PERINO: But not only that, they had told President Obama, Kimberly, -- he went on ""60 Minutes,"" so when he asked about it he said that she had done nothing wrong. I mean it does smell a little --GUILFOYLE: Well, and obviously, he had to be aware that she, in fact .(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: . was, I think inappropriately and how her own private e-mail server and had multiple devices, another lie and, in fact, did send classified information, another lie on her part. And then it shows collusion. It certainly -- to me, it's not very ethically, you can say something not legally punishable or a violation of a specific law. But honestly, this is what undermines people's faith and trust about the credibility and the honesty of government as it stands today and this is the message and the call to arms for change that you were seeing people turnout in record numbers because they don't like this. Exactly what we're witnessing.PERINO: I do wonder, though, if it's Republicans or Democrats. I mean, the White House and the State Department, the campaigns, you -- there is coordination. I don't know if you're going to outlaw it...GUTFELD: Yes, I mean, it goes back to...PERINO: ... or be able to convince people that it was wrong.GUTFELD: But the fact that it's just kind of acceptable. Right? That the media helps a buddy out. It's like the media is a Beavis to the Democrats' Butthead.GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: Or if you're a fan of ""Saved by the Bell,"" the media is Zach, and the Democrats are Screech. Or if you like ""The Gilmore Girls,"" the media is Laine and the Democratic Party is Rory.WILLIAMS: Well, don't stop there.GUTFELD: The media is Ren. The Democrats are Stimpy.GUILFOYLE: Stimpy, oh, I like that. That was a good one. I'll stop there. Stop while you're ahead.BOLLING: So you do interviews with Politico. Some of them may be running or they may not be. And the communications people call you and say, ""Hey, can you ask about this?"" You go, ""Well, you know what? If it works in,"" you say, ""Maybe I can work it in. If it's interesting.""PERINO: Or can you -- they ask you sometimes to not ask questions.BOLLING: But -- or not ask about that, and you go, ""I'm sorry, you can't do that."" If you're good, you say just say, ""No, I'm not going to -- I'm not going to tell you I'm not going to ask that.""PERINO: Can't promise you that.BOLLING: ""Can't promise you that.""But my problem here is just seems like there's much more coordination going on. Yes, we have them. CBS is on board. A wink and a nod, maybe not written in an email but a wink and a nod saying that clearly, there was some sort of coordination between the journalism -- the journalist and the campaign.GUTFELD: It's so funny, because most journalists are uncoordinated.WILLIAMS: You mean there's gambling in this place? Is that what you're saying, Eric? There's gambling here?BOLLING: Not that. I'm talking about...WILLIAMS: But I'm just saying, Dana's point. Look, this goes -- first of all you'd be upset if the White House wasn't talking to the State Department. And secondly, guess what? It happens with Republicans and Democrats. It's just -- it's just politics.GUILFOYLE: Oh, Juan.PERINO: Communications people are always in the story, but they're actually not at fault here.All right. Stay right there, because we've got a big birthday to celebrate ahead. It's our own, the FOX News Channel. Excuse me. I got a little choked up. They turned 20 today. Please join us as we take a nostalgic trip down memory lane, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Welcome back to ""The Five."" And on this day in history, October 7, 1996, a little cable network called the FOX News Channel was born. In almost no time, it became the most powerful name in news.And here we are today, 20 years later, proud to be bringing you the fair and balanced coverage that you deserve day after day.""The Five"" turned five this July, and to celebrate today's big anniversary, we'd like to reflect back on some of our favorite moments since the show began, starting with Eric.BOLLING: I've had so many great times. Actually, the decade I've been here and the five 1/2 years or so that we've been on. Lon Snowden, interviewing politicos, hosting ""The Factor's"" been great. But five 1/2 years ago about this day changed everything for me.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Hello everyone. Five o'clock on the East Coast, and this is ""The Five."" It's our first show.Up first, the issue everyone's talking about: President Obama vowing to get a debt deal done, warning that they'll meet every day until an agreement is made.BOLLING: Thank you our viewers who have come out in droves to support us. Last week we were the highest rated show in all of cable news. Thank you especially, the faithful viewers, because without that there's no reason to put the show on.BOLLING: Four years, four more, I don't know. Forty more. It's been great.GUTFELD: We'll be dead by then.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Thirteen-hundred shows, five plus years it's been a great ride. Wild ride but great ride.GUILFOYLE: Never a dull moment. That's for sure.All right, Dana, what have you got for us?PERINO: Talk about a great ride, remember this in New Hampshire this past year?GUILFOYLE: Oh, boy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: This is going to be the best segment in all of New Hampshire, because the five of us are going to pick the top five candidates. We don't know who we're going to have. And then we're going to slide down this hill.On your mark, get set, go. Oh, no, he's going to win.Congratulations. Donald Trump. You heard it here first.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: And that was a predictive primary win. You won.GUILFOYLE: Trump.PERINO: Won the primary.BOLLING: And I didn't even cheat.PERINO: People all around the company, around the channel were jealous.GUILFOYLE: It was pretty funny. This is the job that we have.PERINO: And you guys were good sports, because I had that idea the night before in the bar. And everyone was like OK, ""OK, fine.""GUILFOYLE: And who got me those pants? Remember, Juan, I ended up with all the ice. I had the whole thing snow down the back. It was crazy, but Juan was helpful.GUTFELD: Helpful in what way? Helpful in what way? Clarify. He's married.GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: Anyway. That was Dana's idea. I think that's what shocked me. Was like Dana wants to go...GUILFOYLE: She was a killer.WILLIAMS: Yes, and did you see her face? I mean, gosh, I think you're a snow bunny.PERINO: I come up with things that I can win.GUILFOYLE: I was like, do we get on our knees or just lay down flat? And I looked up, and Dana was at the end of the mountain. I was like, ""What happened?""GUTFELD: I'll let that line go by.WILLIAMS: Oh, my God.GUILFOYLE: Well, it's true. You have to know how -- the technique to do it. So...PERINO: That was just fun.WILLIAMS: Hats off to the folks at St. Anson's, because that was just fun. That's almost like a childhood fantasy, to go snow sledding.GUILFOYLE: That was fun.PERINO: We'll see what happens in Vegas in a couple weeks.GUTFELD: Yes. Different snow.GUILFOYLE: Juanito.PERINO: Oh!GUTFELD: It's a terrible place. It's a terrible, horrible place. I hate Vegas.GUILFOYLE: Happy anniversary, ""Five"" and our last show.WILLIAMS: So again, sticking with this year, I just had so much fun when we took a bus ride, a bus ride that took us to Cleveland...GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: ... for the Republican National Convention, but we made stops along the way, and one of the stops along the way was at a farm festival.PERINO: Agricultural fair.GUTFELD: It was awesome.WILLIAMS: Agricultural fair. It was so much fun. But the bus was -0- the bus ride was just too much fun. To be with...GUILFOYLE: Where's your video? Where is your video?GUTFELD: Show it. Where's your bus?WILLIAMS: I don't know. They won't show.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: A Democrat in the middle of this crazy country. We have someone from New Florence who votes with her brain. That's right.That's exactly right. That's what I'm thinking.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: And that was great fun because we -- I got to go over to the football hall of fame and throw the ball around with my son and the archivist, who showed me some very valuable football cards.BOLLING: It was fun, but could we never do another road trip bus ride?WILLIAMS: You didn't like it?BOLLING: It was a little rough.GUILFOYLE: You know what? I would love the bus if it didn't move. If we just, like, sat on it and had fun and you did your little rhymes and your crazy talk.GUTFELD: I had the best time. I love buses.GUILFOYLE: And crushed red wine like we did, that was good.PERINO: I had a great time.GUTFELD: I enjoyed it.BOLLING: You were cranking tunes in the back.GUTFELD: Yes. Drinking wine and having conversations.GUILFOYLE: And he was like rapping. He was like Vanilla Ice, rapping...GUTFELD: Please.GUILFOYLE: ... but with pinot noir. And then I was eating salami. And then spilling orange soda on me. It was fun.It was the motion sickness thing that was weird.Greg.GUTFELD: All right. Remember -- it must have been, like, three months ago when a young fellow started scaling the Trump Tower. And Shep, breaking news stepped in. And then I step into Shep.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Shep, do you want me to go get you anything? I can get up here. I can walk over to the coffee place. Do you want some -- you don't want some banana bread or some yogurt?SHEPARD SMITH, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: No. Banana bread or yogurt?GUTFELD: Yes.SMITH: I would probably go for an iced coffee.GUTFELD: I could get you one and bring it over to the studio.SMITH: Look who's arrived. There's no milk in this.GUTFELD: Oh, I'm sorry. But I got the two Equals. And...SMITH: Who let you on this floor?GUTFELD: I still have a security pass, believe it or not.SMITH: That's weird. Thank you so much.GUTFELD: I got this nice white mike.SMITH: It's nice. You're going to make fun of our microphone?GUTFELD: Yes, I am. Why is it white, Shep?(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: We always talk about, you know, because we're on the commentary side about what we do, but...GUILFOYLE: Opinions.GUTFELD: ... we have the best news delivery system in the country, and we have the best news anchor in the world. I think Shep is the fastest, smartest person in the business, and when you look at that news deck, he is our Captain Kirk. He's running that deck.PERINO: You give him three facts, and he can talk for an hour.GUTFELD: I don't even understand how they do it. But they -- like, we can talk about anything, because we're not beholden to facts. It's just opinions. But he's got a stick. He's got -- you give him two words and he will weave it out into a giant sweater of beauty.GUILFOYLE: Wow, that was pretty good.GUTFELD: Thank you very much.GUILFOYLE: What a winning endorsement of Shepard Smith.GUTFELD: I read -- by the way, I read this morning CNN had a piece up there saying that FOX changed the media for the worse by increasing political polarization. And I'm thinking the translation is the liberal media had owned the turf for so long, and they wanted to keep it that way, and then FOX showed up and pants them.GUILFOYLE: So we took back our playground.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: All right.WILLIAMS: Now didn't Shep just once wander through here?GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Yes, he did.PERINO: With the menorah.GUILFOYLE: That was pretty interesting to too.My turn now?GUTFELD: I hope so.PERINO: This is the best one.GUILFOYLE: Well, this is probably the inception of ""Kimberly's Food Court,"" right? So everyone found out about my love affair with food. And here is an example of it. In the Fourth of July with the West Point Band playing and boom, the chicken wing eating contest. Take a look at this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: On your marks, get set, go. These are the chicken wings.GUTFELD: Wow. Oh, my God.PERINO: You have 10 seconds left. And it's 10, 9, 8, 7, 6...GUTFELD: Seven-six.PERINO: ... 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: This is the most amazing -- that is the most amazing footage ever.GUILFOYLE: Winning.BOLLING: You know why? Keep watching. Don't you remember what we had to edit out of the end of that?GUILFOYLE: Because somebody got sick after.BOLLING: The runner up ended up choking...GUILFOYLE: He's a choker. He's a choker.PERINO: You know how sometimes in the packages they'll do speed it up walking.GUTFELD: You don't need it with this.PERINO: That is not sped up. That is Kimberly.GUTFELD: That is real -- real speed.GUILFOYLE: I crushed it. And Dana gave me the best compliment. She goes, ""Any competition I'm in, I want you,"" and I'm a killer. I'm like undefeated.GUTFELD: You looked like you knew what you -- is this something you do?GUILFOYLE: No, I don't go on the circuit. But...GUTFELD: Are you sure?GUILFOYLE: ... I do crush wings.GUTFELD: You could take that -- what's that guy, Joey Chestnut.GUILFOYLE: I've been working on hot dogs, actually.GUTFELD: I'm glad.GUILFOYLE: All right. Anyway...GUTFELD: I mean, I'm glad because I think you could win. Joey Chestnut, watch out. I know Joey.WILLIAMS: Oh, my gosh.PERINO: Want me to help you? We'll be looking forward to the next 20 years and hope you'll still be with us for the ride.GUTFELD: What is with you?BOLLING: Our fault.PERINO: Straight ahead, Matthew is continuing to pummel Florida winds of up to 150 miles per hour. There is immense concern about flooding from storm surges. A live update next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: We want to go back now to Florida where Hurricane Matthew is relentlessly pounding the coast. Leland Vitter is with us again from Daytona Beach. Leland, what is the latest there?LELAND VITTERT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Greg, those counterclockwise winds still coming through here, the last bands of Matthew as it quite literally goes out to sea. You can see the famous Daytona Beach pier still standing. Still, though, very, very heavy surf.And when you look up here, out towards the boardwalk and then down, you do get a sense that there has been some damage and destruction. But it's easy, after a storm like this, when you don't see the decimation, to go, ""It's not really a big deal.""Senator Marco Rubio down here a little earlier, asked him what he thought. He said, ""What you don't see is most important, like this beach erosion."" Not quite as obvious to the untrained eye. He said it will take a lot of time and a lot of money to repair this, which is critical for the infrastructure and for the tourism here in Volusia County in Daytona Beach.So much of their money comes from tourism. And to the point of money, the senator said it's going to take a lot of a time and a lot of money to repair this beach. And you know, Greg, when a senator says it's going to take a lot of time and a lot of money, it's going to take a whole lot of both. Back to you.GUTFELD: Exactly. Be safe, Leland. Talk to you soon.All right. Let's go now to chief meteorologist Rick Reichmuth, tracking the storm in the FOX Weather Center.Hey, Rick.RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS CHIEF METEOROLOGIST: Hey, yes, and we've always been planning that the storm surge is not going to be as bad in Daytona Beach. It's going to be worse once you get up from around Jacksonville to Charleston. And that's what we have going on now, onshore wind piling all that water right there in the cross areas of the coast.The storm has weakened a little bit. Good news. It is still right on that verge between a Cap 2 and Cap 3 hurricane. Winds of 110 miles an hour and the pressure really low. So when you have low pressure, it is still a very, strong storm right there, and it's right off shore. The center of the storm is about 35 miles off the shore. And it's been moving towards the north, but because the way the coast line moves, it's moving towards the north and it's going to start getting closer tonight into tomorrow morning here across parts of Georgia and in towards the Carolinas.Flooding concerns are going to be a big story as we move forward. The worst of the rain is yet to come, and that's going to be in South Carolina and North Carolina. Some spots up to 15 inches -- guys.GUTFELD: Thanks, Rick.REICHMUTH: You bet.GUTFELD: All right. ""One More Thing"" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Time for ""One More Thing."" K.G. kicks it off.GUILFOYLE: All right. Well, this week, as you guys know at home, my little man, Ro-Dog, celebrated his 10th birthday. So we have a big game truck party tomorrow. And these are some photos we got to take with our friend, amazing photographer Kevin Kendrick Photography. You can check his stuff out at KPKPhoto.com. So it was really a fun day. And you can see the big teeth, the big smile there, right, in so many of the photos.Anyway, it was really nice, and they grow up so fast. So give your kids extra hugs and kisses at home and feel so lucky to have them every day in my life. He's really, truly a treasure, little Ro-Dog.Can you believe how big he's gotten?BOLLING: Handsome boy. Handsome boy.GUILFOYLE: And thanks again to Kevin for taking care of us. Very nice. He posted those later -- and there he is with his dad, as well.BOLLING: Very nice. Very nice.GUILFOYLE: All right. Eric.BOLLING: Lots of accusations have been lobbed at Hillary Clinton. You know, taking money from lobbyists, pro-NAFTA, taking money from Wall Street. But they're not from Donald Trump; they're from this guy, her biggest supporter on the campaign trail. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (THEN SENATOR OBAMA): Senator Clinton is the same person who has taken more money from lobbyists than any other candidate, Democratic or Republican. This is the same person who took money from financial folks on Wall Street and then voted for a bankruptcy bill that makes it harder for folks right here in Pennsylvania to get a fair shake.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: He went on and on and on. Again, that's 2008 when he ran against Hillary Clinton. And by the way, RNC, cut that ad. Cut that ""One More Thing,"" make that one of your next ads.PERINO: I think that -- that some of that is one of the reasons why Hillary Clinton has had such a hard time with millennials. The relentless pounding that she took by President Obama when they were running against each other and then you had the Bernie Sanders with the same type of message this year. And you'll in some of this polling, the numbers with millennials are really bad.BOLLING: Those -- they should get out there. They should start using some of those.PERINO: Mine is we're going to celebrate a colleague of ours who's in the Washington, D.C., bureau, and that is James Rosen, who has compiled and edited a beautiful book written by -- well, it's a compilation of work by William F. Buckley Jr. It's called ""A Torch Kept Lit."" And he was on ""FOX & Friends"" this morning, talking about it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAMES ROSEN, AUTHOR, ""A TORCH KEPT LIT"": This is a collection of 50 eulogies that Bill Buckley delivered or wrote over the course of his career for the towering figures of his time. If you love history, politics, art, music, sailing, spy novels, all those things that Bill Buckley loved, you're going to love this book.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: I have to say that the smartest people I know always read the obituaries so they can learn about people, including my husband, and Tucker Carlson.GUILFOYLE: Very nice.PERINO: Reads the obituaries. So, congratulations to James.BOLLING: Tucker reads the obituaries?PERINO: Yes, he says he always does, because that's where you learn about America and great people.GUTFELD: He's just happy he's not there. ""Made it another day.""GUILFOYLE: Tucker sees dead people.PERINO: It's true.BOLLING: Greg, you're up.GUTFELD: All right. My Saturday show, 10 p.m., G.G. Show. You've got Tyrus, he's going to be good. Going to Comic Con, the great pro wrestler. Rob Long, you know him, you love him, great writer. Kat Timpf, Jessica Tarlov, it's going to be great. We're going to have a debate preview.I'm also breaking a big story. Tech billionaires are investing mucho bucks to find out whether or we live in a matrix, i.e. this is all simulated.BOLLING: I believe that.GUILFOYLE: I strongly believe it.GUTFELD: They believe there's a 50-50 chance that it could be true.GUILFOYLE: Somebody trapped me here with you.GUTFELD: Yes. Is this the Secrets to Happiness? I can't remember. Maybe not.But you know what? If you're a polar bear and it's hot out, this is actually a polar bear cub enjoying himself in a pile of ice. A neat fact about this adorable polar bear cub, that when he becomes an adult, he will be able to rip you to shreds. Everything adorable as an animal gets big, and they will try to eat you. It is a fact. Do not forget it for the rest of your life.GUTFELD: See, that's how much I enjoy the hot tub. I can relate to this. If that was a hot tub, forget it, amazing.WILLIAMS: All right.BOLLING: All right, Juan, you're up.WILLIAMS: So I was reading an obituary this week.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.WILLIAMS: It was for a recluse named Rod Temperton. And to my surprise, Mr. Temperton wrote some of my favorite songs and probably some of your favorite song, too. Here are two by the King of Pop, Michael Jackson.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(MUSIC: MICHAEL JACKSON'S ""THRILLER"")(MUSIC: MICHAEL JACKSON'S ""GET ON THE FLOOR"")(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: So that's pretty amazing that Rod Temperton wrote both of those, but he also wrote ""Boogie Nights.""(MUSIC: ""BOOGIE NIGHTS"")GUTFELD: Great song.WILLIAMS: Temperton passed away age of 66 in London last week.GUILFOYLE: Aw. Too young.WILLIAMS: But his songs, his songs are going to be on the radio forever.GUTFELD: Kudos to you, Juan, for giving, you know...GUILFOYLE: Credit.GUTFELD: ... credit to the writer. They never get any credit.WILLIAMS: He deserves it. He was great.BOLLING: We've got to leave it right there.
