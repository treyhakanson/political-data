This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: We begin tonight with a ""Hannity"" cable exclusive. Bob Woodward is the author of a brand-new book that has all of Washington talking, which is usual practice. It's called ""The Price of Politics"" and it takes you, the reader, behind closed doors into the negotiating rooms of the Capitol and the White House, and it exposes how the president tried but ultimately failed to restore the American economy.Now, this book raises some very serious questions about the president's ability to look beyond politics and lead the nation during times of great consequence.And here to talk about that and much more is the man himself, the author of ""The Price of Politics,"" available in bookstores everywhere. Associate editor of The Washington Post, Bob Woodward is back. How are you? Good to see you.BOB WOODWARD, AUTHOR, ""THE PRICE OF POLITICS"": Thank you.HANNITY: I read the book cover to cover. I want every American to read it for this reason -- and it should make everybody angry at the level of dysfunction at a time, you say, the American people have never had any real knowledge of just how severe this was.WOODWARD: I mean, it was the kind of crisis that took the country's economy to the cliff. President Obama, when I interviewed him for the book, said they were days away from having $5 billion in the U.S. Treasury. That's it. Now, that's half a day's federal spending.If you think about it, to let that happen -- not just the pesident, but the Republicans could have sent shockwaves through the country, could have done things to the American economy that Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, said would have been worse than the 1930s depression.HANNITY: I mean, it's so dysfunctional. It's far worse than we ever said. Here's what really bothers me in all of this. You know, we have 25 million un and under-employed Americans right now. One in six Americans in poverty. Forty nine million Americans on food stamps in this country. We are really -- and nearly $6 trillion at the end of Obama's first term in new debt. This is not a game anymore. This is about as serious a crisis as I think we have faced since the great depression and getting worse.WOODWARD: And this was last year. And they fixed it by postponing everything.HANNITY: Yes.WOODWARD: No cuts, no tax increases, no sensible alignment of the federal budget. And so, we are going to in December or January be back in the same mess and the federal government is going to be in the position where there is no Congressional authorization to pay its bills. Now this as you will know, this is a federal government that borrows $1 trillion a year. We have got -- I mean --HANNITY: More.WOODWARD: In the book, as you went through it, it's Tim Geithner, to his credit, who is running around saying, fire! We have got to fix this! We are going to do potentially something that will be indelible and last for generations. It is going to screw up everything. And when you get into the details, you realize that it could have been fixed.HANNITY: Yes.WOODWARD: That quite frankly, I think Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan would have sat down and said, we can't let this happen.HANNITY: Well, you go into detail in the book about that, how Ronald Reagan -- remember, I don't know if you mention Tip O'Neill, but you talk about his liaisons to Congress. And both he and Bill Clinton, on the phone late at night. They had relationships with members of Congress. That's not the case with President Obama.WOODWARD: That's right. And it's not, you know, the White House was saying, oh, this is something -- my conclusion. It's in the book, it's Larry Summers, who was the economic czar for Obama in the White House for the first two years. And Summer says, Obama has no feeling for the game of politics, no sense of the joy of the game. And in fact does not like these people up in Congress. And so, he's cut off. He has not got the sort of phone call relationship, personal relationship where he can call somebody up and say, look, let's -- let's do this. Let's do a deal that's in the larger interest of the whole country.HANNITY: So, on the brink, they were going to have, what? Five billion in the Treasury -- that's a billion not trillion. Five billion. We are basically out of money.WOODWARD: Yes, dry.HANNITY: Yes. Done. Finished. All right. So, they we are right up to the brink here. The president doesn't have a good relationship with Congress. Behind the scenes, you describe him meeting with the speaker of the House John Boehner, the nicorette merlot cigarette summit, whatever.WOODWARD: Yes. Because Boehner said, you know, here Obama is having iced tea and chewing nicorettes and Boehner's having a merlot and a cigarette.HANNITY: All right. So, but they are trying to get this deal together, the two of them.WOODWARD: To their credit. To their credit.HANNITY: I will agree with that.WOODWARD: Yes.HANNITY: To their credit, except, I wouldn't have liked that as a conservative. Because Boehner was agreeing to do something that the Tea Party would have had a fit about, which is raising, what? Eight hundred billion in taxes, and then Obama comes back and wants $400 billion more at the last minute.WOODWARD: Yes, and of course, Boehner's argument is that $800 billion over 10 years in new revenue through tax reform, which of course is what Ronald Reagan did in 1986 and actually lowered the income tax rate down to 28 percent. It's hard. But it's been done. And it was one way to -- to get out of this. But you are absolutely right. It's the President who comes in and says, oh, we need $400 billion more in some form or his position is, he offered it, hey, John --HANNITY: Yes. At the last minute.WOODWARD: Yes. Kind of at the last minute. And when you get into the nitty-gritty details, you wonder, well, why would he do that? He did it because six senators came out with a new plan, and David Plouffe, who was the senior political adviser in the White House, the man who was Obama's 2008 campaign manager says, oh, wait a minute, this is a watershed moment. This will give Boehner more maneuvering room because some Republicans are calling for more revenue. And the Congressional liaison in the White House tells the president, look, if you don't do this, you are going to be seen as the weakest president in all of mankind. And in that kind of environment, the president impulsively goes out, endorses the plan and Boehner is trying to -- go ahead.HANNITY: You know what infuriated me as all of this is going on as you described in the book? The president's fixation on one issue. That this can't come up again before the election. I actually think the one thing that might have helped, if it did come up before the election, because it would be self-serving at that moment that they might have the pressure of getting something done. And I thought, that bothered me that it was -- he was thinking about electoral politics while we are on the brink of bankruptcy.WOODWARD: That's one side of the argument. The other side of the argument is, can you imagine having this kind of a crisis in the middle of a presidential campaign?HANNITY: It might get something done.WOODWARD: Well, but you know what happened last year, getting something done was postponing everything to 2013. They did nothing -- not this painful at the time.HANNITY: That's the story here for the American people. They didn't have the courage, the ability, to navigate through these tough times and they pushed it all up to 2013. And you know what the CBO is projecting, a very bad year next year.WOODWARD: A government created recession.HANNITY: It's the most predictable economic crisis we have ever had.Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC.

They went after those organizations to make sure they didn't participate in the 2012 elections; they went far beyond just doing a routine audit. They did not target liberal groups. This is going to end up in Washington and its going to have a special prosecutor. This is going to end up like Watergate, this is bad stuff. This wasn't just a handful of enemies; this was anyone who put their head up above the parapet.RICK UNGAR: It may be politics at play but where I have to take some exception is saying that it's going to end up in Washington. I'm a little old fashion about this. I think there needs to be evidence before you convict somebody. So far there has been no evidence that even puts it in the lower levels of Washington, let alone the people you might want to see get tagged with this.SABRINA SCHAEFFER: I think we are going to see more evidence coming out. This is not about the rule of law; this is about the Obama administration trying to control the flow of information. I am sensing a pattern here, between the IRS scandals, the media tracking scandal, the NSA spying on average Americans, this is an administration that wants to control the flow of information and it's suddenly coming to a head here with the IRS scandal and I couldn't agree with Steve more about this.MORGAN BRENNAN: This is a political issue for no other issue that you're talking about tax exempt status for organizations that identify themselves politically. Whether this is a one sided witch hunt, just how far back to Washington this goes, I think a lot of that remains to be seen. I think it's unfortunate, the bigger issue here for me is the fact that 501c's have been a super secret area for campaign funding, which is what it's not supposed to be; I think that is getting clouded over.JOHN TAMNY: Of course not this is political; people are realizing that people act in their self-interest. In the private sector, that means businesses give us what we want in terms of products and services. When it comes to the government, an entity that is unaccountable, that is not liked by certain outside groups, they are going to investigate those groups. I think the IRS's actions are scandalous, but what is scandalous to me is the fact that the IRS exists to begin with.BILL BALDWIN: I think these complainers would have saved a lot of grief if they just took the word tea party out of their applications and put in an innocuous name such as coalition for health care outreach if they had called themselves Americans for big government, they would have been fine. The bigger scandal has nothing to do with C4, the bigger scandal is with C3, and these are the ones where you can get a tax deduction for giving them money. The scandal is overtly partisan groups set up semi-autonomous C3s called, foundations, called education and gets these tax deductable donations to do what they are going to do.A new survey shows two-thirds of Americans who don't have health insurance....may not buy insurance offered under the health care lawSTEVE FORBES: If they don't get everyone into this then obviously they are going to have more costs. They have designed it in a way that younger people even with subsidies are paying more than they should in a normal free market. Initially, younger people are going to say, if they catch me, I'll just pay the small fine and not have to pay 5-7,000. If you go on these exchanges and make apples to apples comparisons, California and Oregon, Permanente plans, you will find out you pay more on the exchanges then you do on the free market because the government puts in a lot of stuff that most people don't want.RICK UNGAR: California exchange rates are coming in better than what we expected and people under 25, the mean income was under $25,000 a year which qualifies a large percentage of them for subsidies would be paying less than they do now.JOHN TAMNY: Of course cost is going up because this is not insurance. Insurance is historically cheap because you are buying something for the unthinkable. Politicians with Obamacare want us to have insurance, something to pay for every malady and they also want it to be so that when we show up and get insurance when we are already sick. Because this is not insurance, it is naturally going to be expensive. If you want cheap health insurance, make into insurance again.MORGAN BRENNAN: I think it's safe to say that premiums are going to go up for some people. How much and what it's going to look like and for the people that it will go up, a lot remains to be seen. These exchanges don't even open up until October. I think there is a lot for Americans to focus on and they are focusing on before we even start to look at this. We just had the jobs number come out this week, we still have about 20 percent of young adults without jobs, and they are looking to get those jobs before they think about enrolling on exchanges so I think it still premature. We also have the debt ceiling debate that is going to go on before this even takes place.BILL BALDWIN: I think costs are going to come in less than expected. Anyone with common sense expected costs to triple; instead they are only going to double.SABRINA SCHAEFFER: The big problem is that the government is mandating that people buy something they don't need. The minimum essential coverage is so high that they are ineffectively telling people they need to buy a 5 bedroom house when they really need a 1 bedroom apartment.The TSA finally canceling its plan to allow knives, bats and golf clubs on planesSABRINA SCHAEFFER: I don't think anyone on the panel can say that asking moms to take the little booties off their babies or making me turn over manicure scissors is actually keeping us any safer. It is probably making us less safe because everything is so systematized, so regularized that terrorists or those who want to hurt Americans will know how to navigate the system. We need ways to make the system more efficient and try out new screening techniques.RICK UNGAR: The logic kind of fails here. Even if you were to privatize every airport, you would still have the government deciding whether or not knives can go on a plane or not, you're not going to leave it to every security firm saying yeah you can take them on in Detroit but you can take them on in Los Angeles.STEVE FORBES: Especially when there is a delay and tempers are rising up, you don't want anything in people's hands. Privatized airports are more efficient than those that aren't. San Francisco vs. Los Angeles; San Francisco I 50-70 percent more productive, even though they pay the same wages, go through the same training and operate under the same agency. What this goes to is, privatize, the TSA can set standards as the FAA does but let companies figure out how to do it more efficiently and come up with innovations.JOHN TAMNY: That's why you privatize. If American doesn't protect its passengers, they go out of business. If the TSA doesn't protect it, it gets more taxpayer money to expand its bureaucracy. The profit motive is the path to innovation. Airlines will compete to figure out the best and safest ways to get people through airports. Let the people compete here.MORGAN BRENNAN: I think you keep the TSA minimally there to set the regulations and I think you bring private sector workers in to operate at the airports and we are seeing more and more airports apply to have this scenario at their locations. Sarasota-Bradenton was the latest one this week. Congressman John Mica, the grand daddy of the TSA, is proposing this as well.INFORMER: Graduation stocksMORGAN BRENNAN: Valero Energy Corporation (VLO) 52-WEEK HIGH: $44.733 52-WEEK LOW: $19.283BILL BALDWIN: TOTAL (TOT)52-WEEK HIGH: $55.3552-WEEK LOW: $41.75"
