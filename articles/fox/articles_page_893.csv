This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" September 30, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: I'm Eric Bolling and I'm with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Dana Perino And Greg Gutfeld. It's 5:00 in New York City and this is ""The Five.""Now that Donald Trump is about to take podium at a rally in Michigan to state Hillary Clinton lost to Bernie Sanders in the primaries. We're waiting for that. We'll take some of that. The Republican nominee has been working to counter attacks from all fronts this week. He has a lot of powerful enemies looking to take him down -- the Clintons, the mainstream media, even the U.N. body's official news service actually put out a tweet calling on millions of Americans abroad not to vote for Trump.It was deleted about 20 minutes later and some sort of excuse was being made. Meanwhile, another big newspaper decided to go after trump. This time, USA Today taking a side in a presidential race for the first time in its 34-year history calling trump unfit for the presidency. He, of course, won't be taking that to heart. He never trusted the media anyway.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Oh, is the media dishonest. How dishonest are this people? How dishonest. Unbelievable. Not all, not all, but a big, big fat percentage.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Well, remember how trump took flack in the media for this week -- this week for saying he was given a defective microphone at the debate. Well guess what, four days later, the commission just today admitted it's actually true saying there were issues regarding Donald Trump's audio that affected the sound level in the debate hall. So, a lot to unpack, kg, are you composed.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: what are you laughing about?KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: I can't tell, remember?GUTFELD: Can I talk about it?BOLLING: sure, sure. You're supposed not to. Anyway, so we have USA Today, we have the debate, we have the tweets, what do you want to start with?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Any of them.GUILFOYLE: Whatever you like.BOLLING: All right, let's start with USA Today. USA Today saying for the first time with their 34-year history they're would recommend not voting for somebody.GUILFOYLE: OK. Well, I mean look, that's what this country is founded on, first amendment principles. People being able to give their voice, their opinions to say they want to support a candidate. To say they would not like to support a candidate, you know. So, you're going to see this happen but then of course you see with trump.He is going to hit them back and say ha, ha, and now you're going to lose subscribers. So, this is the way the cycle works. It is a free market and people can choose to buy, to subscribe or not based on their ideology or political persuasion and maybe sometimes those things pass because you may actually miss the paper.BOLLING: Juan, can I stay in there with you for a little bit. I notice that the USA Today is going to publish them, right?WILLIAMS: Yes sir.BOLLING: Same with the Arizona Republic, the one they also said that they'll recommend Hillary? I think they went so far as and said they recommend Hillary for the first time is Democrats. Any links there? Publishing a kind of company that says we're against it.WILLIAMS: No. I think they have an independent editorial. I think the key here is you have people increasingly saying, you know, Trump has a chance to win and we think he's a danger to the country. And so I think people are speaking from principles and you see it now across political lines. People who are conservatives as well as people who are liberals saying this and the news this week has been the number of conservative editorial boards who are willing to stand up and say, you know what, we know that there are folks who are big Trump fans who may cancel on us or whatever, but we are not going to stand by this moment in history and allow the country to fall into the demagogue.Now, what's interesting to me is Trump this morning goes on a twitter storm and he's back into the fat pipe, right, with the Miss Universe. Well, I think in a way again, this is Trump media strategy, you know. He just says, you know what, let's focus on this as oppose to all the scandal with his Foundation that he didn't have a permit to raise money with, with Cuba where he's doing business, where it's illegal and nobody pays any attention.BOLLING: We can talk that stuff in the next 58 minutes. Staying with the media, staying with the newspapers, did you see Chicago Tribune back Gary Johnson?DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Yeah.BOLLING: I mean, the day after...PERINO: There is a few paper -- oh, well, that's...BOLLING: (Inaudible)PERINO: It's like throwing away your endorsement -- it would be one thing of sort of like USA Today which has never endorsed. This is unusual for them. It might be -- if you are going to endorse Johnson, you might as well just, maybe just say we're not going to have anyone to recommend especially after that. But the thing for Trump, it might work in his favor in this regard, and so you mention the media is unpopular, the U.N. is (inaudible) and ridiculous, and then the Clintons are not liked.So, he's not trying to persuade any of those people anyway. He's actually trying to beat them and one of the things we saw in Michigan, a couple of hours ago where Trump is going to be speaking -- we're going to take it to you live when it comes up  -- but people stood in line for hours in the pouring rain in order to see him. So, he's actually -- I would not worry too much about all of these things. Like the U.N. is never going to be for a Republican president.They're always going to be for the Clintons, the media largely, probably on editorial pages not going to be for him. So, it's actually for the most part doing a lot better than it would have if you were just a regular Joe Republican.GUILFOYLE: Dana, also because we're talking about the -- he's the outsider the outsider candidates. So that he's not getting those endorsements by those big papers.PERINO: But it is significant that there is history being made by some of these papers like Arizona Republic and the USA Today making that...BOLLING: All right, Greg, Dana points out the U.N. tweeted -- they're like 8 million, I think 8 million abroad would have affected if they listened to the U.N. but Dana also astutely points out most Republicans don't listen to them.GUTFELD: Well, I have to (inaudible). All right, I haven't talked...BOLLING: I know, that's why, yeah.WILLIAMS: Can we just mention that they said they were hacked.GUTFELD: All right. But I think this would be a perfect fact for a Trump ad, I mean, when the U.N. comes out against you, they don't do the same for genocidal maniacs and misogynist homophobic jihadist. So, you should consider it a feather in your cap when the U.N. -- it's like -- it's like the U.N. insulting you is like David Duke calling you a bigot. It actually works in your favor.By the way, this complaining of the media, Donald Trump got $2 billion of free media in this election. He bragged about having never to get TV ads because he had us. He had cable news. Cable news took care of it and the media loves him. The media wants him to be president because it's good for their ratings.  I mean, it may not be great for the country but boy, you could make a lot of money off his unpredictability.Lastly, the microphone thing is a bunch of baloney because he even said the first 30 minutes of the debate were the best 30 minutes and I agree. He was excellent when there was a malfunction. Maybe the malfunction should have been the entire debate. If the mic was bad, he could have won the debate.BOLLING: You know, I was in that debate hall and it was...(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Right, right, there is no question that it went out equally as the same volume to the TV public, but in there it was endless (ph) of what we can hear. Listen, it could be a bit -- throw you off your game a little bit.GUTFELD: But that was the best part. That was when he's on his game.BOLLING: It was really only about five or seven minutes. I think they...(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: All right, let's see this. As Juan mentioned, Trump fired off a lot of tweets this morning regarding his feud Miss Universe. He's gotten a lot of pushback. This afternoon, he put on another tweet to hit back. He says, ""For those people knocking me for tweeting at three o'clock in the morning, at least you know I'll be there, awake, to answer the call"" and that's a clever response referring to Clinton's missed the 3:00 a.m. call from Benghazi so, Juan.WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know what to say, I mean it's like, wow! Do you think that the guy made a mistake by getting into this -- I think we've all said it -- I think even you, that he fell in into a trap, that she set him up, Hillary Clinton, when she had Miss Universe in the audience.BOLLING: You know Lester Holt set him up.WILLIAM: I don't think Lester Holt have anything...(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: ...just tell me what I said.WILLIAMS: OK. I mean, I thought -- OK, but I mean we agree -- it looked like Hillary Clinton really like put a trap there and said go ahead and step right in the hole, Donald Trump. And he stepped in the hole, then afterwards even as people were debating how he had done during the debate, he went off on this riff about women who are really a difficult group for him as voters anyway and now he continues. I mean to me, I don't understand but it seems like he can't control. Doesn't he sleep, Eric? 3:00 in the morning.GUILFOYLE: Hey, don't hate on people that don't sleep. I like it. It's like you have something to do.BOLLING: Has anyone ever tweeted anything that they were happy about at 3:00 in the morning.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Nothing really happen after midnight.GUTFELD: It's like the Chris Rock line about, if you're going to the ATM at 1:00 a.m. it's for bad things. So there are no good tweets at -- but this goes back to the fact that we mentioned all of his enemies, the media, the U.N., USA Today and all this. His biggest enemy is himself. If he just gets out of the way of himself, you know, Hillary set this thing up. They have the ads ready.They have the conference call. They knew through the psych (ph) ops that they had done that this was -- this is what was going to set him off, and he did. And it's like, I said it before, he has a weight problem. He just can't wait it out. If he just ignored this stuff, it would have been great. But he can't -- Twitter is his safety zone and if you really like Trump, you shouldn't enable him. You know, as big his supporter is should be telling him, lay off.PERINO: Well, they have for quite a while. I don't know maybe last night he was snuck in to wherever there were trying to (inaudible) his backup phone.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: They really should make him put the phones and the laptops in a lock box -- in a box and lock it.PERINO: I like that John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, he said, I'm up enough -- they're the same age -- he said, I'm up enough that time of night but, as well...BOLLING: For other reasons.PERINO: But don't pick up the phone when you have to go.BOLLING: KG?GUILFOYLE: Maybe they ordered one of those Hillary Clinton special Blackberry he got one off of eBay. They were hiding it.BOLLING: All right.GUILFOYLE: Maybe?BOLLING: Very good, perhaps. All right, let's do this. Let's see if Trump is -- he still hasn't approached the podium. If he does...GUTFELD: Rudy.BOLLING: We're going to bring you -- Rudy is still there. Well, look at that, Rudy really is...GUTFELD: Rudy is pulling out some imaginary things.BOLLING: We'll do this and hopefully we'll get back and Mr. Trump will be at the podium and we'll take a listen. Next, Hillary Clinton is actively trying to connect with millennial voters, will it work? And later, it's Facebook Friday. Post your questions for us now in facebook.com/thefivefnc and we'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: The nation's largest generation, nearly 90 million, are now at voting age, but will they turn out on Election Day and for whom. There is concern particularly by Democrats about the millennial vote. Third party candidates, Johnson and Stein are losing ground with the youth as the election nears as you'll learn on the podcast where I have with Chris Stirewalt, to explain that whole thing. And the Clinton team enlisted help from Bernie Sanders this week and put out this new millennial family ad titled, ""Squad Goals.""UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Squad.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I really, really, really want to elect Hillary Clinton.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're going to work out hearts out to make Hillary Clinton the next president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA: I cannot hear you, are you with me?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I see Americans of every party and every background and every faith, men and women, young and old, gay and straight, native-born and immigrant, that's who the hell we are.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Another approach is an interview with R&B star Mary J. Blige.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARY J. BLIGE, R&B STAR: Do you think it's hard for a woman to be both tough and likeable?CLINTON: Yes, I think it's really hard. I think it's rooted in tens of thousands of years of how people's lives have been defined for women to be assuming, leading roles in business or entertainment or politics or whatever it might be. It still is not fully understood because there is no blueprint.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: All right, they just introduced Trump and so we'll going to get back to that in a second. Can I ask you quickly Juan, do you think one of the reasons Hillary is having hard on this millennials is that Bernie Sanders spoke so harshly about her for so many months and was so popular with them, that it's hard for them to turn around on that?WILLIAMS: You know, I thought Bernie didn't speak harshly about it but it was that Bernie Sanders speaking to the issue that really burns these millennials, which is big business, Wall Street, Occupy Wall Street, that kind of theme. And he really pumped into that and into the depth of student debt. Those are issues that drive them. Hillary Clinton's been late to the game on it.PERINO: Did you like that? See, I thought the ad sounded upbeat and kind of fun.GUTFELD: I would love to be in the meeting where all the (inaudible) discuss how to make something look hip, quick text, blast graphics, you know, a good beat and in the middle you have BS, which is Bernie Sanders. The key insult to pandering to young people is you have to expect them to be dumb. You're expecting them prefer hip celebrities over actual issues. So that's why they look for celebrities. And squad goals, that sounds like a painful exercise.PERINO: I didn't like that title. I don't really understand that. I think we're going to have Donald Trump in just a second, but Johnson and Stein, they're numbers had been good. They're dropping, but we do have Donald Trump now so we're going to save that for right after he speaks.(BEGIN LIVE VIDEO)TRUMP: Thank you. It is so great to be back in Michigan.(CROWD CHEERING)A state I've come to know and love during this campaign. You know, we love Michigan and that was a great big fat beautiful victory, you know that, right?(CROWD CHEERING)And I've been talking about Michigan for a long time. We can't let them take your car industry out or your industry out of your state any longer, not going to happen.(CROWD CHEERING)I'm going to fight so hard for all of you and I'm going to bring back the jobs that have been stripped away from you and from our country.(CROWD CHEERING)In 39 days -- 39 days, can you imagine? It started off where we are a long ways away and some people didn't give us a good chance. They said Mr. Trump, the other day one of the biggest people in that business, the very dishonest press business.(CROWD BOOING)They said Mr. Trump, when you started off, you have to tell me the truth, did you really think you'd be here? I said, what the hell do you think I am doing this for, right?(CROWD CHEERING)No, we expected to be here and we're all here together. It's a movement, and believe me, we're all here together, we're going to take our country back.(CROWD CHEERING)We're going to win the state of Michigan. We're going to win the White House and it is going to be an awfully good November 8th. That evening is going to be a celebration.(CROWD CHEERING)We're going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists and the powerful politicians that have stolen your jobs through theft and incompetence. They've stolen your wealth. They've taken your middle class. We're going take on the arrogant, corrupt corporate media that have enabled the global theft of American prosperity. A theft that has left behind crumbling schools, roads, bridges, and a totally depleted military. We have the greatest people in the world and our military -- we're going to rebuild our military. This is what we needed.(CROWD CHEERING)It's time by the way, to rebuild Detroit. We're going to rebuild Detroit.(CROWD CHEERING)It's time to rebuild Michigan and we're not letting them take your jobs out of Michigan any longer. And it's time to rebuild the United States of America. We are going to do it. Our country is going to be greater than ever before. We're going to be the smart country again.(CROWD CHEERING)Hillary Clinton has made a living raking in donations from special interests that have raided our factories and ripped the jobs right out of Michigan and every other state. That's how she gets rich, by taking your jobs and your money away from you and away from your state.UNIDENTIFIED MALE/FEMALE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!TRUMP: That's why Hillary Clinton, if she ever got the chance would 100 percent approved the Trans Pacific Partnership. The deal she lied about the other night when I said she called it the gold standard, she said no. Guess what, she called it the gold standard and Lester Holt did not correct her, I wonder why.(CROWD BOOING)The Trans Pacific Partnership will economically devastate Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and so many other states all across this country. It will be devastating also for Ohio. Hillary Clinton's daughter wants the TPP and their wish will be her command, that's what it is. This special interest pay her for speeches, she's not a good speaker. Not a good speaker. But there are a lot of money. You know, we have thousands of people here today. There are thousands and thousands of people outside trying to get in. Thousands.(CROWD CHEERING)PERINO: We'll you've been listening to Donald Trump, and he's right. People stood in the rain for hours, thousands of them to get in there to see that rally. We're going to bring it back to ""The Five"" right after this break. This election has certainly been intense.We can all use some laughs right around now and of course we start Kimberly Guilfoyle. I listened to that earlier, but next, we're going to have ""Saturday Night Live"" do the trick because tomorrow, and it returns for season 42. It's got a surprise new cast member playing Trump. We're going to tell you who next. And Facebook Friday still to come, don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Trump is the real life inspiration for Iron Man. Who am I? This is Joe Pepperoni. No, I'm not Donald Trump in disguise.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The New York City subway is the best way to get around, and also going fast (ph).  (END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: And now you're laughing. I love it. That's happened to me. ""Saturday Night Live"" knows how to lampoon presidential races and a lot of fans are anxiously awaiting the shows return tomorrow for season 42. The talents of Kate McKinnon will reprise her role as Hillary Clinton.But Trump, guess what, he's not going to be played by Darrell Hammond anymore. That's cancelled. Ready for this? Alec Baldwin will sporting his best Trump impersonation this season. Greg, does this please you? I see a little cat like smile on your face.GUTFELD: Well, I thought that Hammond was great as Trump and I think I am sure Alec Baldwin will be good but Trump is really his best impersonator because he's such an iconic figure that only he could be him. You don't need impersonators. But ""SNL"" will claim to hit both sides and show this. They'll go after Trump and they'll go after Hillary but the content is different.Trump will be seen as some kind of evil diabolical clown and Hillary will be seen as some kind of benign robotic nerd who knows all the facts. So they say there'll be balance but you'll know who -- there's an agenda. This is an agenda driven show.GUILFOYLE: There you go. Dana, what do you think?PERINO: Well, Republicans never fare well in the general election on ""Saturday Night Live."" They just don't. Trump I agree -- he's funniest when he's being himself and he can be a little self-deprecating when he goes like on Fallon's show, it's like it's very funny. I do wonder who is going to play Alicia Machado. That's a skit that they didn't plan to have and it will be highly anticipated, and I think it's fraught with a lot of politically incorrectness.GUILFOYLE: And is it going to make the situation better or worse?PERINO: I don't know. I don't know.GUILFOYLE: We don't know. Bolling, you've been waiting for the moment for them to do ""The Five"" on there.PERINO: Oh my god. Don't ask for that. I would never ask for that.BOLLING: Fallon, can Alec Baldwin do as good of a Trump as Fallon? I think he's probably the best out there. I don't know. Maybe he will.But don't forget something else, though.  Trump goes on ""SNL"" a lot.  He's been host -- he's hosted that show quite a bit over the years, as well.  So maybe they won't.  Maybe they'll be fair.  Maybe they might just take equal shots at both of them.  What was that?PERINO:  My mic wire was showing.  I'm trying to get it...GUILFOYLE:  A robot wire is becoming exposed.  This is a problem.BOLLING:  Is someone talking in your ear, telling you what to say, Dana?GUTFELD:  Were you making -- if you were making hand signals to Juan.  PERINO:  They're like, ""Tuck your mike in.""  I'm like, ""What?""  I'm like, ""What?""  And that's what...BOLLING:  I got you.GUILFOYLE:  OK.  So Juan, what do you think?  Is this a good call?  I think Alec Baldwin, he has no problem kind of getting in people's faces and getting after.  I think it's going to be, like, a cathartic role for him.  WILLIAMS:  So apparently, Tina Fey recommended Alec Baldwin for this role.  And I just don't see it, because I thought Daryl Hammond had the kind of face.  His face, and his gestures.So I'm interested to see what comes of it.  But I must say in terms of the criticism at this table, your favorite place for me.  You know what?  I think that they should be very direct and, I think, lambast Trump.  I think he, in some sense, opens himself to this at every turn.  GUTFELD:  But OK, yes, easy fodder.  But Hillary is -- come on.  PERINO:  Well, the other thing is Alec...GUTFELD:  But no, that's a false equivalency, Greg.PERINO:  The other thing is Alec...WILLIAMS:  What's the equivalence between?  Like newspapers recently have been criticized, because they're now calling Trump outright ""liar.""  They say this, New York Times prints ""liar,"" right?  Lie.  GUTFELD:  Hillary doesn't lie, does she?WILLIAMS:  No.  That's what I was getting to on the equivalency.  I think there are some people on the Republican side, who say, ""Well, you know, they both have their problems.""GUTFELD:  Right.WILLIAMS:  ""You know, Hillary and her email, Juan,"" you know.  And think there is no equivalency.  When PolitiFact weighs their lies, it's like here is Trump and here is Hillary.  PERINO:  I think that's true.  That you could actually make a pretty fun thing, have a James Comey character, like, talking about Hillary's lies on the FBI investigation, the emails.GUTFELD:  But that would make everybody in the audience uncomfortable.  PERINO:  Alec Baldwin knows what it's like to put out a tweet...GUTFELD:  Yes, that's true.PERINO:  ... that gets ridiculed, so in some way he might be a little bit more closer to it than Hammond.  GUILFOYLE:  Guys, should -- is it a good idea, yes or no, for them to go back on as themselves -- have Hillary appear, have Trump -- before the election?  Yes or no?GUTFELD:  Probably not.  Because how much time do you have left?BOLLING:  Weeks.GUILFOYLE:  They could get it done.PERINO:  Thirty-nine days.  GUILFOYLE:  I say yes.  GUTFELD:  Great math.  PERINO:  I'm not even counting.  I would not do it if I were the Republicans.  I think Hillary Clinton would probably be fine, but I just feel like the conservative always ends up with the short end of the stick at this point in the election.  GUILFOYLE:  But Trump did well.GUTFELD:  Which conservative?PERINO:  It's just too risky.  I think it's too risky.  BOLLING:  I would say he should.  I'd say he should.  I think he can -- yes.  Remember when he did hotline bling.GUILFOYLE:  Yes.BOLLING:  He did a nice job with that.  I'd like to see him, especially if they -- I assume Kate McKinnon won't be Hillary on the same show.  PERINO:  Do you remember when he was mad at -- remember when he was -- well, the story goes that he was very frustrated when President Obama was making fun of him at the White House Correspondents Dinner.  And I just feel like, if Trump -- he needs to stay in the game in terms of focusing on Hillary.  Taking time off to prepare to be on ""Saturday Night Life"" and the risk of that when the election is this close, I just wouldn't take that risk if I were those guys.  WILLIAMS:  You now that previous segment got cut short.  We are talking about millennials and her needing to do more with the millennials.  I don't think it's the case that he's going to do better with millennials.  The question is whether they get excited about that.PERINO:  He can keep her numbers down.WILLIAMS:  ""Saturday Night Live"" actually could help her.  GUTFELD:  But Trump has a lot of millennials that were -- that probably don't watch ""Saturday Night Live.""  PERINO:  Nobody watches TV anymore.  GUTFELD:  Yes.  Don't say that, Dana.  This is our life.GUILFOYLE:  I know, Dana.GUTFELD:  I've got a mortgage.  GUILFOYLE:  Geez, ""The Five,"" we are recession-proof.  Stay right there, because ""Facebook Friday,"" hard-hitting news segment, up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(MUSIC: THEME FROM ""THE TWILIGHT ZONE"")GUILFOYLE:  My gosh.GUTFELD:  Yes, ""Facebook Friday,"" we answer your questions.  OK, Kimberly, you're up first.  This is from Sandra S. ""What posters were on your wall when you were 12?""GUILFOYLE:  Oh, 12 years old was probably -- I think I had one KISS poster.  PERINO:  Wow, really?GUILFOYLE:  Edgy.  I'm edgy.  You didn't know that.GUTFELD:  Yes.GUILFOYLE:  And also I had, like, I know, like Shaun Cassidy.  Or...GUTFELD:  Of course.GUILFOYLE:  ... you know, you had to.GUTFELD:  Who didn't?  I have three older sisters.  GUILFOYLE:  Right.GUTFELD:  They had every Cassidy.  GUILFOYLE:  Who else did I like?  Oh, I liked Christian Slater.  GUTFELD:  Well, there you go.  Poor man's Jack Nicholson.Hey, Juan.GUILFOYLE:  You know that he can sing Frank Sinatra.  He sang it to me one time.  GUTFELD:  Good for you.WILLIAMS:  In person?GUILFOYLE:  Yes.  WILLIAMS:  That's pretty amazing.  GUTFELD:  Juan.WILLIAMS:  That's awesome.GUILFOYLE:  Thanks.WILLIAMS:  You know, I don't remember having posters.  Sometimes I would, like, cut silly things out of the paper.GUTFELD:  Right.  WILLIAMS:  Like I saw the other day somebody was celebrating Willie Mays's catch, you know, over his head in the polar grounds (ph).  And I think I had something like that, you know, stowed away on the side there for a while.  But I'm just not that interested.GUTFELD:  You're not a poster guy.  Did you have any pets?WILLIAMS:  No.  I had a turtle at one point.  GUTFELD:  You put that on your wall?WILLIAMS:  No.  I was told later that they're very dangerous.  They have all kinds of diseases.  GUILFOYLE:  Yes, they do, like box turtles get different things.  You have to be very careful.  WILLIAMS:  There you go, see?  You should have been my mom.GUTFELD:  Eric.GUILFOYLE:  And also, I should have been your mom?  What kind of psychological issues have you got going on there?  My goodness.BOLLING:  Probably like most guys, 12 years old, ""Charlie's Angels.""  Farrah Fawcett, the Farrah Fawcett...GUTFELD:  Yes.BOLLING:  ... iconic.GUTFELD:  Right.  PERINO:  Yes.  GUILFOYLE:  I love ""Charlie's Angels.""  BOLLING:  A funny story, though.  I brought it home, put it on my wall and my mom made me put it in the closet.  ""You can have it on your wall, but it's got to go in the closet.""PERINO:  Sweet.WILLIAMS:  Maybe you could be his mom.GUTFELD:  What about you, Dana?PERINO:  Well, I remember, at 12, this might have been a little bit -- I might have been a little bit younger, Shaun Cassidy.GUTFELD:  Of course.PERINO:  And Rick Springfield.  GUTFELD:  Yes.PERINO:  But then I think around 12, do you remember Tiffany.GUTFELD:  Yes.PERINO:  I had a poster of her.  GUILFOYLE:  You're so funny.PERINO:  Do you remember her?GUILFOYLE:  Yes, totally.  We're the same, because I used to love Rick Springfield when he was on ""General Hospital.""  Also, we were both Bluebirds, Campfire Girls, which is also very unique.  We didn't go, like, the Girl Scout.  And also our debate teams stuff and speech.WILLIAMS:  Can you bring me in the circle?  Who's Tiffany?PERINO:  Tiffany?  I'll play it for you later on YouTube.  GUTFELD:  She sang in malls.GUILFOYLE:  ""I Think We're Alone Now.""GUTFELD:  You know what I had when I was 12?  I had a poster of Bill O'Reilly, shirtless, when he was in Menudo.  He was only in there for about eight months.GUILFOYLE:  Did he have a spray tan?GUTFELD:  Yes, he had a spray tan.BOLLING:  Was Geraldo in Menudo, too?GUTFELD:  Yes, they were all in Menudo.  That's how we hired everybody, from Menudo.GUILFOYLE:  No Geraldo -- Geraldo's still in it.GUTFELD:  Hannity was in Menudo.PERINO:  Oh, my God.  He could -- sing.OK, this is it, we'll go this way.  This is from Brook G.: ""If you could go anywhere in the world for a week, but you have to leave tonight, where would you go?""  Dana.PERINO:  I would go to -- oh, what's it called -- Antiqua.  Because my friend, Ingrid, has a house there.  She's invited us a couple of times, and I've never been able to go.  And so I would go there for a week, and I would not take my phone.  GUTFELD:  Wow.  That's cheap.BOLLING:  I would go to Spain.  I was in Spain about 15 years ago.  Amazing country.  I actually adore Spain.  I haven't been back since, and I've been dying to get back.  GUILFOYLE:  I've never been.  I want to go.  BOLLING:  Madrid, Barcelona...PERINO:  Valencia.BOLLING:  I've never been there before.  GUILFOYLE:  ""The Five"" road trip.PERINO:  Me neither.  I'd like to go.GUTFELD:  Never again.  GUILFOYLE:  Oh, my God.BOLLING:  I'll second that.GUTFELD:  Juan.GUILFOYLE:  You were, like, bathing in vin (ph).WILLIAMS:  You know, I just love the beach, so I'd just go to the beach.   I'd go to Jamaica and go to the beach.  GUTFELD:  Yes.WILLIAMS:  But on the other hand...GUILFOYLE:  You like Red Stripe?  WILLIAMS:  No, not particularly.  GUILFOYLE:  Anything else, sir?WILLIAMS:  But -- but I think, you know, I was thinking the other day I'd like to go hang out in Tokyo again.  Because I was having a party; it's party time.So the other day somebody was saying to me there's a place over here that's just a door and a stairway.  And they said if you go there, actually, it's a bunch of Japanese businesses partying hard.GUILFOYLE:  Deja vu?WILLIAMS:  And I was like -- I've never been in there.  But that's the way it is in Tokyo, you can go in a black door in an alley, and it's like whammo.  PERINO:  Juan, you're not supposed to go down there.  GUILFOYLE:  No.  That's called Lace.  WILLIAMS:  Oh my God.  GUTFELD:  K.G., if you could go anywhere in the world?GUILFOYLE:  OK, where would I go?  OK, here's the problem.  Zika got me down.  That's the problem.  Zika got me down.  I got the Zika blues.  Yes, it's a condition.  GUTFELD:  Yes, I know.  No, no.GUILFOYLE:  Health insurance covers it.  Well, I don't actually have Zika.PERINO:  Go to California.  GUILFOYLE:  I'm just worried about it.  GUTFELD:  It's actually -- it is a worry where there are mosquitos.  So you should be worried.  You should make sure that you wear long sleeves wherever you go.  You know where I would go?  And I said this before last time.  I would go to my laundromat and stay there the week.  I want to see if they're actually cleaning my shirts.  Because I -- I think they're just ironing them.PERINO:  You really know how to show your wife a good time.  GUTFELD:  Well, you know what?  This is me.  They didn't say me and the wife.GUILFOYLE:  You know that's a little OCD, right?GUTFELD:  They said me.  GUILFOYLE:  That's a little weird.GUTFELD:  All right.  Brenda -- ooh, this is my favorite question.  We start with you, Eric.  Brenda P.: ""What are your workout routines?  Gym?  Home gym?  Job in the park?""GUILFOYLE:  Kim Kam (ph) Laundry, can't you tell?BOLLING:  It's -- I run a lot.  I just run a super lot.  I run Saturday and Sunday.  I try and run two days during the week in the morning.  I try and get five miles each time.  I haven't really hit the gym very much, but I've lost 15 or 16 pounds.  GUILFOYLE:  I know, but you don't eat.  You're manorexic.  BOLLING:  A little bit.  A little bit.GUTFELD:  You don't eat.GUILFOYLE:  You are, for real life.BOLLING:  I feel good, though.  Feel good.GUTFELD:  What about you, Kimberly?  What do you do?  Any exercise?  You kickbox, don't you?GUILFOYLE:  Yes.  I kickbox and then I had that unfortunate leg situation.GUTFELD:  Right.GUILFOYLE:  Remember that one?PERINO:  I'm not laughing about it, but...GUILFOYLE:  Remember my ruined vacation?  I've seen pictures of my leg, and I had my legs up.  They were like -- I won't do that again.  GUTFELD:  At least you're not -- at least you're not into any kind of combat exercises where someone fights you.  Juan.WILLIAMS:  Does that happen?GUTFELD:  I've heard it happens.GUILFOYLE:  That happens here.WILLIAMS:  Here?GUTFELD:  Not -- not that I'm aware of.  It was a dream, Juan.WILLIAMS:  Is that right?  Is that right?  BOLLING:  Exercise.  GUILFOYLE:  This move like this, and then toss to the ground.  And then, ""Ah, ah.""  Just ""Ah, ah, ah.""GUTFELD:  Juan.WILLIAMS:  We had a reenactment.GUTFELD:  Come on, gym routine.  WILLIAMS:  Oh, I go to the gym all the time.GUTFELD:  Yes.WILLIAMS:  But I like to do different things.  And lately, I've been doing more and more with weights.  And I typically do not...GUILFOYLE:  You have a trainer, too, I heard.  WILLIAMS:  I do occasionally use a trainer, because I like to box a little bit.  So yes.  GUTFELD:  How about you, Dana?PERINO:  Well, I am trying to think of something, like I surf on whatchamacallit.  Something funny.GUTFELD:   Surf on a potato chip or whatever.PERINO:  Yes, something like that.  But I have a personal trainer named Katie.GUTFELD:  Wow, everybody.PERINO:  And then I have a Pilates instructor named Kate.  BOLLING:  Didn't you meet my brother-in-law at Pilates?  GUILFOYLE:  I used to have a trainer.  PERINO:  We were at there around the same time.  That's right.GUTFELD:  ""Pilates"" sounds like some kind of illness you get as a kid.  PERINO:  Really, it's, like, really good for your spine.  GUTFELD:  Yes, I had Pilates, I couldn't leave the bed.You know what I do?  I do resistance.  I call it body resistance training, where you find a partner, instead of using weights, and you just press against each other, usually in the park.  GUILFOYLE:  Oh, you and Lou.GUTFELD:  At 1 or 2 in the morning.  Bryant Park.  Just a lot of pressing.   I like to do it early nights or early work out routines with strangers.  GUILFOYLE:  I thought it was Dobbs.  GUTFELD:  Dobbs.GUILFOYLE:  He's in great shape.GUTFELD:  Ahead, Juan's got some news on his favorite football team.  The Washington -- what are they?WILLIAMS:  No!GUTFELD:  What are they?  WILLIAMS:  I'm not -- I can't.  I can't.GUTFELD:  They have a development that could settle the never-ending -- tease.GUILFOYLE:  You're on the -- you're on the screen with that.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS:  Oh, you guys know it, I'm a big fan of the Washington football team.  But what I'm not a fan of is its official name.  It begins with an ""R,"" you know, Redskins.PERINO:  Whoa!GUILFOYLE:  Whoa!WILLIAMS:  Hey, hey, hey.  But I don't like saying it.  I don't like -- you can say it.  You can say anything you like.  I don't like saying it, because it's a slur, in the dictionary defined as a slur against Native Americans.  So I'd like to see it changed.  I know some others who don't agree -- Mr. Bolling -- but soon, the Supreme Court will settle the issue.  The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case that will decide whether the government can deny a trademark because it's deemed the name involved to be offensive.  It's a case involving an Asian-American rock group called -- and I'm not even comfortable with this one but I'll say it, because you need to know -- The Slants.  So Greg, what do you think?GUTFELD:  You know, look, right or wrong, it's a measure of the true leisure class that we can spend years talk -- quarreling over words.  In other parts of the world, there are people that are terrified because their country's being destroyed, that there are bombs falling on them, not band names.  They're not concerned about band names.  They're concerned about bombs.  So I don't know.  WILLIAMS:  So Dana...GUTFELD:  We're lucky to have these problems is what I'm saying.  WILLIAMS:  I hear you.  But I'm saying, Dana, 1946 law says that the U.S. Patent Commission can reject names that disparage people, living or dead.  Now, that's -- the counterargument is First Amendment says government should not penalize private speech.  PERINO:  One of the reason I pitched this this morning I do think -- I like to think about issues like this.  I don't necessarily know how this will turn out at the Supreme Court.  I do note that in The Washington Post poll that they released in May, nine out of ten Native Americans said they are not offended by the Redskins name.  And so at what point does the court overstep the opinion of the people and those First Amendment rights?  It's an interesting legal case.  GUILFOYLE:  So Eric, the Justice Department has said a trademark is a government benefit, not a limit on private speech.  BOLLING:  All right.  The other camp that says they'd like the free market to dictate whether or not the Redskins decide to be called the Redskins or they change their name because they find it offensive -- some people find it offensive.  And they'll stop watching the games, going to the games, buying the jerseys.  That's the best measure, rather than the Supreme Court telling people what they should or shouldn't be calling themselves.  WILLIAMS:  So Kimberly...GUILFOYLE:  Yes.WILLIAMS:  ... let me just make -- mention another case.  Which is the state of Texas issues license plates for special groups when the sons of the confederate veterans asked for a license plate with the Confederate flag, Texas said no and the Supreme Court upheld Texas' refusal.  GUILFOYLE:  All right.  OK, so there's precedent there that they can try and hang their hat on, Texas style.  But in this case, the band are members of the community that the government is trying to protect; and they are seeking themselves to be able to have this name for their band.  So it's a little bit, you know, different in some aspects of it, I think.  And then also I think that you just have to be able to say what about the comparison to rap music?  What about using offensive language...WILLIAMS:  I agree with you.GUILFOYLE:  ... if you have African-Americans doing rap and saying -- and using the bad words and then to this?  Why can't these people call themselves, you know, whatever name they want?PERINO:  Right.  WILLIAMS:  But wait a second.  These aren't -- these aren't...GUILFOYLE:  What's the difference?WILLIAMS;  This is not a football team made up of Native Americans.   Anyway...GUILFOYLE:  What?PERINO:  That's true.  WILLIAMS:  ""One More Thing"" up next.GUTFELD:  About the...GUILFOYLE:  I'm talking...(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING:  ""One More Thing"" -- Greg.  GUTFELD:  All right.  ""The Greg Gutfeld Show,"" tomorrow 10 p.m., we've got Tyrus the great wrestler.  We've got Alan Dershowitz.  We've got Colonel Alan West.  Oh, man.  PERINO:  Way to go.GUTFELD:  Kat Timp (ph), as well.  That's tomorrow at 10 p.m.  And now this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD:  Greg's Sports Corner(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD:  All right.  We're going to the cat in the bag Olympics.  We've got Furry McPawson.  Come on.  Furry McPawson versus Catnip Johnson.  Catnip Johnson's in the bag, and Furry thinks that, well, she's going to get past Catnip Johnson.  But no.  Wait until you see what happens.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(CAT INSIDE BAG LEAPS OUT AT CAT WALKING BY)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE:  Oh, my gosh.  GUTFELD:  Yes.GUILFOYLE:  What amazing, like, agility.  BOLLING:  Don't even think about it.  GUTFELD:  Yes.GUILFOYLE:  That was -- my gosh.  I love those catlike reflexes.  GUTFELD:  They are literally catlike.  BOLLING:  Let's move on.  All right.  Check out 8 p.m. tonight I'll be hosting ""O'Reilly.""  Mark Cuban -- I taped this earlier -- Mark Cuba came on.  I wanted to ask him about his reaction to Hillary Clinton using his name out on the campaign trail in the aftermath of the debate.  I also asked him why he -- he actually called Donald Trump at one point the best candidate in American politics ever, and now he can't stand him.  So asked him what happened there.  PERINO:  Yes, what happened?BOLLING:  And then this one.  NBA, Juan, as you know, starts pretty soon.  Right?  So if his Dallas Mavericks take a knee during the national anthem, what's he going to do?  He's going to respond to all that.  Also, don't forget the new Fox News polls are out in just a couple of minutes, so we're going to discuss that, as well.  Who's next?  K.G., you're up.  GUILFOYLE:  All right.  OK.  So time for...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE:  Kimberly's Royal News.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE:  Your favorite segment, Greg.  GUTFELD:  It is.GUILFOYLE:  Everybody, Greg especially, royal cuteness alert here.  Because Prince George and Princess Charlotte were delighted by balloons, bubbles and mini horses that Greg could even ride at British Columbia's government house garden party yesterday in Victoria, Canada.  PERINO:  Cute.GUILFOYLE:  How cute is this?  So people are loving this online.  GUTFELD:  What's he doing to the tree?GUILFOYLE:  And they joined -- stop.  They joined 24 other children of Canadian military families to celebrate and enjoy the afternoon.  And the duke and duchess of Cambridge are on a week-long tour of Canada.  BOLLING:  All righty.  GUILFOYLE:  And on ""Hannity"" tonight.  BOLLING:  Dana is up right now.PERINO:  OK.  So we do this podcast.  It's called ""Perino and Stirewalt.""  I'll tell you what, we record them on Wednesday.  So there's a new one, if you haven't listened to it yet.  Here's a little listen from yesterday.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PERINO:  Did Hillary Clinton shore up wobbly Democrats?CHRIS STIREWALT, CO-HOST, ""PERINO & STIREWALT"":  Yes.  She shored up voters across the spectrum, because she was confident; she had energy.  She showed, as Trump would say, stamina.  She showed that she was a presence.   And she was...PERINO:  She was having fun at one point when she did that little dance.  STIREWALT:  Shimmy was not good.  Don't shimmy.PERINO:  No.  Inside shimmy only.  STIREWALT:  Yes, exactly.  Shimmy...PERINO:  Never, ever let them see you shimmy.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE:  I shimmy.  PERINO:  You can shimmy.  Maybe not shimmy on the debate stage.  So we have our Sunday show at 5 p.m. this weekend.  So I hope you'll join us.  We have a great panel, too.BOLLING:  All right.  Juan, you're up.  WILLIAMS:  Well, you know, boys will be boys, and a big bet -- big bet -- at the Ryder Cup practice.  A hundred bucks on the line after a fan heckled Rory McIlroy for consistently missing a putt.  The European team then invited the fan, a guy from North Dakota, an insurance salesman, to see if he could sink the putt, and they put 100 bucks on the ground and said, ""You've got it if you can do it.""  Look at this.  PERINO:  No way.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(MAN SINKING PUTT)(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS:  Yes, baby.  Yes, baby.  Now, that is sweet.  I mean, how can you not celebrate for this guy?  I mean, yes, baby.  Go for it.PERINO:  That's so great for North Dakota.  GUILFOYLE:  What a boss move.  I love it.  BOLLING:  So the moral of the story is heckle professional golfers.  You might win 100 bucks.All right.  We've got to leave it there.  That's it for us.  Have a great weekend, everyone.  ""Special Report"" coming up right now.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MARIA BARTIROMO, HOST: Good morning.The rush is onto make the last pitch to caucus-goers in Iowa.Good morning, everyone. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Welcome to ""Sunday Morning Futures.""Ohio Governor John Kasich and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul joining me life from the campaign trail moments away on the most important issues of the first in the nation caucuses.Plus, where do we stand in the GOP race for president? Will tomorrow's results narrow down the field? And will they be a tale tell sign for the rest of race? We'll start there with our panel.Plus, coming up, what will come of these top secret e-mails from Hillary Clinton's private server? Former House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa on the investigation, as we look ahead this morning on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""(MUSIC)BARTIROMO: When Iowans begin caucusing Monday, Governor John Kasich will be in New Hampshire instead. The presidential hopeful's eyes remaining on the prize in the Granite State, which has been the major focus this past few weeks.Meanwhile, his campaign picking up a big endorsement this weekend from The New York Times editorial board. They write, quote, ""Governor John Kasich of Ohio, though a distinct underdog, is the only plausible choice for Republicans tired of the extremism and inexperience on display in this race."" Mr. Kasich is no moderate.Joining me right now is Ohio Governor John Kasich from Manchester, New Hampshire.Governor, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.GOV. JOHN KASICH, R-OHIO, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My pleasure, Maria.And, by the way, we had good news last night. The Quad City papers in Iowa also endorsed me. It's the third largest newspaper in that state. That was just a wonderful endorsement to receive.And, of course, here in New Hampshire, there have been eight newspaper endorsements. And I've been able to receive seven of them, Maria. I don't know what the heck is going on, because you know me, you know, I ain't that great. But, you know, it's pretty nice to be getting all of this -- it's pretty nice to be getting all this support out there.BARTIROMO: You really are. These newspapers are looking at your experience reiterating what you've done on budget issues among others and talking about that as the reasons why.I wanted to start with ""The New York Times"" --KASICH: I think it's a bigger issue.BARTIROMO: Go ahead.KASICH: I think it's a bigger issue than just experience. If you read them carefully, it's been the ability to get people to work together and with some of them, it's the ability to come up with creative ideas. So, it's not just experience. You know, experience, if you don't do anything with it, what's the point?But it's the ability to solve problems. That's kind of -- that's a big part of it by bringing people together. And that's -- that's really -- it feels terrific to have them say that.BARTIROMO: Absolutely. And you've made this point, the truth is that voters are tired of the back and forth of pointing fingers.KASICH: Yes.BARTIROMO: And want to figure out who it is that has that leadership that can bring the two sides together to actually get things done. How important is an endorsement from the New York Times? I mean, you know, obviously, it's a real positive to get those newspapers in New Hampshire and Iowa, to get behind you. But, of course, the first few states that we're talking about in terms of caucuses aren't exactly New York Times readers necessarily.So, how important is the New York Times editorial endorsement?KASICH: Well, just think about you, Maria. What if the New York Times came out and said you were a tremendous commentator? You would love it.BARTIROMO: I would love it.KASICH: I can tell you really love it. I'll tell you who else would love it? Your mama, your mother would love it, I know that.BARTIROMO: Right.KASICH: Hey, look, they made it clear. They don't agree with me on a number of issues, but they certainly know that I'm a conservative.But I welcome the Gray Lady. I think getting New York Times is fantastic, along with the Boston Globe. And what it really says this is a guy that doesn't travel, you know, in some narrow lane. He has an ability to appeal to many people who may not even agree with him philosophically, and I'm thrilled to hear that.I mean, the idea that I can take my positions but express them in such a way that people who may not even agree with the fundamental, you know, they give you credit. They say, you know, good guy, smart guy, can get things done.So, I'm absolutely thrilled with the ""New York Times"" because that's -- that with the Boston Globe and these newspapers in Iowa, that's something you never forget. It's a wonderful, wonderful tribute.And I'll tell you this -- my wife said she heard one of my daughters scream yesterday. And she ran out and said what is it, Reese? And Reese said, ""Daddy just gotten endorsed by the New York Times.""Now, when your 16-year-old daughter gets excited, you better be excited.BARTIROMO: That's cool. That is really cool there. I'll give you that.How do you differentiate how to campaign in Iowa versus New Hampshire? So much conversation these days about how you have really focused and doubled down on New Hampshire.KASICH: Yes.BARTIROMO: Even you're going to be there tomorrow while they're caucuses in Iowa. How do you differentiate what to do in these different states?KASICH: Well, Maria, the problem with -- I got in in July. And the problem with Iowa, it's so big. I mean, there's five media markets. It's impossible to put the time in there and the time in New Hampshire.So, I still do the same thing in Iowa with town halls. I did a couple. I just did a teletown hall, I guess, last night, if I remember. It's been like a blur.But here, there's 1.3 million people in New Hampshire and they're all sort of condensed. You can stand in the middle of New Hampshire and hit most of the state with a stone. In Iowa, you have to fly all over the place.So, we'd decided to put a lot of emphasis here. But, look, we're prepared to move on. We have a ground game in South Carolina. We've got things going in Nevada. We're very strong in Mississippi with Congressman Greg Harper and former Senator Trent Lott.We are prepared to move all over the country and we've got people who are highly skilled. But we've got to come out of here. I think we will come out of here well. We're running second in almost all the polls. We'll see.BARTIROMO: Yes, just terrific.How important is this election to the economy, Governor? I mean, last week, we got some dreadful numbers. GDP showed growth of 0.7 percent.KASICH: Unbelievable.BARTIROMO: Really not good.KASICH: Well, Maria, look, you know, you've been the money expert for a long time.And here's the three things. You can't have -- you can't over-regulate.  You've got to have common sense. You have to cut taxes for businesses and individuals, and then you have to have a fiscal plan that makes sense and then start working on the issue of workforce.Those -- that's the formula. So, if we elect somebody and they don't know how to do it or they're not tough enough to carry out these issues and get thing things accomplished, because within the first hundred days, I told Paul Ryan, I'm going to have, you know, the balanced budget, the tax cuts, the regulatory reform on your desk, your head's going to spin. And he looked at me and chuckled because he used to be an aide when I was budget chairman.We have to move quickly, Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes.KASICH: I was there when we did it in Washington, and it's happened in Ohio. If we're not tough, we're not focused and we don't know what we're doing, we're going to keep drifting, as you know.BARTIROMO: Yes.KASICH: And it just sends all the wrong signals.BARTIROMO: And it's not good for the average guy and gal out there.KASICH: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: How can they move the needle in their own lives.Governor, we'll be watching. Good to see you, sir. Thanks so much.KASICH: Thank you, Maria. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Talk to you soon. Governor John Kasich.A voting booth is pretty straightforward, right? But how exactly does a caucus work? And how is it different from voting in a primary?FOX News' senior correspondent Eric Shawn with that angle.Eric, good morning to you.ERIC SHAWN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria, and good morning, everyone.You know, it is an election and then again, it is not. The Iowa caucus considered many as our country's greatest demonstration of grassroots democracy at work. You know, they don't walk in on a voting booth.  Instead, starting tomorrow night at 7:00 p.m., caucusgoers will spend several hours at 1,681 caucus sites that can include public schools, fire houses or churches, listening to hours of speeches on behalf of candidates before they make their choice.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a big responsibility for Iowans. And we want to be a part of it and be educated about it as well. So, we're also political creatures, it's fun.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHAWN: The Republicans process is fairly straightforward. They listen to the pitchers for the candidates and then they vote.But the Democrats split up into groups. That's where Patrick Murray, head of the Monmouth University Polling Institute says the night's unique horse trading begins.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PATRICK MURRAY, MONMOUTH UNIVERSITY POLLING INSTITUTE: You walk into there, you hear the speeches. And then the party chair or the caucus chair will say, all right, if you're for Hillary Clinton, go into that corner, if you're for Bernie Sanders go into that corner, O'Malley back here. They'll look around the room and say, O'Malley people, you have not met the 15 percent threshold, you've got to go somewhere else. And then they get swarmed by the Sanders people and the Clinton people saying, come over here, come over here.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHAWN: The winner does not always go onto be the nominee. Witness Rick Santorum, Mike Huckabee, Tom Harkin.Despite all the anticipation, turns out that most people in Iowa do not even take part.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MURRAY: Iowa gets all this attention and they're this engaged electorate, but 85 percent of Iowa voters will be watching ""American Idol"" reruns on Monday night. They're not going out to participate in this caucus.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHAWN: Well, besides Iowa, about a dozen states also use the caucus system, but we really only pay special attention to just one. The state's motto says, ""Our liberties we prize, our rights we will maintain."" And that yet again, we put to the test as it is every four years tomorrow night -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Exciting times. Eric, thank you.Coming up next, nearly two dozen documents on Hillary Clinton's e-mail server now said to contain information too, quote, ""top secret"" to release in any form. Could this latest revelation lead to an indictment? I'll be talking with California Congressman Darrell Issa coming up.Hope you'll follow us on Twitter @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures.Stay with us as we look ahead to Sunday morning on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Twenty-two documents on Hillary Clinton's private server containing information that the State Department calls top secret and actually, too damaging to release.Still, Clinton's campaign says it wants the seven e-mail chains to be made public, even though they're top secret. Well, the FBI has been investigating Clinton's e-mails.My next guest says this could lead to the indictment, or should lead to the indictment of the former secretary of state herself.California Congressman Darrell Issa joining us right now.Congressman, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.REP. DARRELL ISSA, R-CALIF.: Well, thanks for having me on, Maria, and thanks for covering this important issue at such a time in our nation's history.BARTIROMO: Yes, it is important and I know that voters want to hear the details of it. So, I want to ask you about your support for Marco Rubio, but let's start with Hillary Clinton and these 22 e-mails that apparently now, the public will not get to see because the State Department says and the Justice Department says they are too damaging.What do you know about them?ISSA: Well, as you said, they're not 22 independent e-mails. There's some back and forth. What we know is that this is information that when you look at it, you should recognize it goes towards sources and methods and classified operations.And that's where the judgment of Secretary Clinton comes in. She would have you believe that over 1,300 documents that needed to be redacted for sensitive classified information, that as they were going back and forth between Huma and other people, including apparently 18 e-mails that went back and forth to the president, that she never recognized not one of these as material that should be classified, that should not be on her personal server, that should not be removed from the government when she left office.BARTIROMO: Yes. And you know what we see what David Petraeus has gone through over the last two years in terms of a similar situation, releasing information that was not to be released. And yet, you know, I don't know if you saw Hillary Clinton's statement about this, she was doing an interview with NBC and she basically said, look, it's like Benghazi, it's not going to be important.I mean, you are the former oversight committee chairman of that investigation into Benghazi. How do you feel about that response?ISSA: Well, this is where her judgment is in question, where her honesty is in question. Maria, let's understand people are looking at sort of the shiny object of classified, did it say classified, exactly what did it say.Let's go back. What was Secretary Clinton's judgment in setting up this site? What was her judgment in exchanging and having, if you will, e-mail conversations about sensitive information? What was her judgment in not giving a copy of this required by law to the State Department when she left. And what was her judgment quite candidly in this delay process that she went through where she essentially delivered none of it and now says, oh, I want it all made public.The fact is, I don't want it all made public. The information that is sensitive, I'd like the select intelligence committee to see it, but I want to make sure it's not made public because that's exactly what she's got to be held accounted for.When you fill an elected official or an appointed official's head full of highly classified and sensitive information, they're not required to live up to when it says secret or top secret on a document. They're required to keep those secrets for life, not say them on the air, not put them in a book, and candidly, not take them with them when they leave government.BARTIROMO: You think that the FBI Director Jim Comey would like to indict both Hillary and Huma Abedini, her aide?ISSA: Yes. For more than 15 years during my service in government, I've watched the basis on which U.S. attorneys and the attorney general and, of course, the FBI look for cases in which people's judgment, where they've knowingly done things wrong, make for good prosecutions.This, if it were anyone other than Hillary Clinton, would be that case.  You have somebody whose basic wrongdoing led down a road to the communication back and forth and then effectively removed it from government hands, kept it, and even today, you know, a sort of lying in plain sight.You know, there's no one left to lie to in this case about, no, there were no classified documents. Yes, there was classified material. Even the president who said he learned about it on the news seems to not have an answer for why 18 of these communications were back and forth with him.BARTIRONO: Let me switch gears to Senator Rubio, because I think that most people know at this point that that is the sensitive spot when you're talking about borders and Senator Rubio. That took place in our debate, on the FOX Business Network, took place again on the FOX News debate. Because of the bills that he's backed, gang of eight, the immigration innovation, where basically it enabled tens of millions of foreigners to come into this country and be part of our democracy with all the services that go with it.Is this an issue that is not important to you in terms of his past or do you think Marco Rubio has changed his position on this?ISSA: One, he said on television what we all know, which is just wishing the 12 million people would be swept away isn't going to do it.His position has always been any agreement has to secure the borders, stop the flow, remove criminal aliens and then deal with those already here in an appropriate and humane way. Some will leave. Some probably will stay.  The American people know that.And he's not changed a position. What he's done is he's reached out both on our side of the aisle and the other side of the aisle and tried to find a principled solution that would stop illegal immigration, secure our borders and then begin dealing with those who here in violation of our law but in plain sight.You know, I'm strong on immigration reform. I've backed every single one of the attempts to secure our borders, so has Marco Rubio. It's the reason he has so much support is that people want a president who will try to find a solution, but at the same time, they want somebody with the principles that he has which are sometimes misstated by political opponents.But Marco Rubio has always been for securing our borders, stopping the flow of illegals, getting rid of criminal aliens and then dealing with those already here. And you can have a discussion about that last part, but Marco's made it clear. Without the first parts, there will be no deal.BARTIROMO: Yes, really great analysis. Congressman, good to have you on the program. Thanks so much.ISSA: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon, Congressman Darrell Issa.ISSA: Thank you.BARTIROMO: And we will see him tomorrow for more coverage of the Clinton e-mails investigation. Tune in to ""Mornings with Maria"" tomorrow morning on the Fox Business Network. Congressman Issa will join me once again at 7:00 a.m. Eastern tomorrow morning on Fox Business Network.New poll numbers out of Iowa possibly clueing us in on which way caucus- goers are leaning now. We'll break it all down for you as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back. It is game on in the final run-up to the Iowa caucuses, a new poll from The Des Moines Register, it shows Donald Trump leading the GOP field at 28 percent, suggesting his debate no-show could be a nonfactor.I want to bring in our panel right now.Ed Rollins is former principal White House adviser to President Reagan.  He's been a long time strategist to business and political leaders and a FOX News political analyst.Mary Kissel with us this morning, a member of the Wall Street Journal's editorial board. And Hank Sheinkopf is a former Democratic consultant for the Clinton-Gore campaign.Good to see, everybody.ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Thank you.BARTIROMO: I say game time, because here we are at the beginning.What do you think the field looks like going into the important Iowa caucuses, Ed?ROLLINS: On our side, obviously, it's Trump and Cruz. And my sense is, I've been wrong on everything on wrong so far, but I'm going to bet that Cruz is going to take this thing.BARTIROMO: You think Cruz takes Iowa?ROLLINS: I think it's going to be very, very close. But the last poll here, and just left a little bit out, part of the poll was done before the debate. Part of it was done after the debate. Really doesn't have the impact of what occurred.Cruz has 10,000 people working in the field. He has his voters identified.  It's very, very close.The Iowa poll underestimated evangelical vote. Evangelical votes about 59 percent. They had 47 percent. When you put that in, it's a dead even race. I think by strength of an organization, Cruz is going to win this thing.BARTIROMO: So, how important -- do you agree with that, Mary?MARY KISSEL, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD: I do agree with that. I think we're going to find out just how strong Trump's organization really is on the Republican side. And on the Democratic side, can Bernie Sanders get the college kids out to caucus.I also am looking at Marco Rubio just to see how much momentum he builds.  He's playing a long game here. His bet is not just on Iowa or like the other three other candidates, Christie and Bush, and Kasich. He's not betting on New Hampshire. He's playing a very long here.So, he's betting that Cruz is going to be wounded, he's going to build momentum in Iowa and that will give him push him into New Hampshire and give him some momentum when he gets to the southern states.BARTIROMO: And why is Iowa so important? Well, it's because the first --(CROSSTALK)ROLLINS: No offense to those in Iowa. I spend many, many winters in Iowa.  It basically is a barometer. People pay a lot of attention. That's first and that's the key thing.BARTIROMO: Hank, what do you think?HANK SHEINKOPF, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, it's simple. Donald Trump's brilliant strategy of trying to become the evangelical candidate may in fact backfire. Why? He's got to become the evangelical candidate. Now, the question is, because he's been ahead in the polls, people say, well, Trump should have done, if he doesn't do, then he didn't do, and he has a really different set of problems.Very smart strategy that may in fact back-fire. Give it to Trump by an edge. On the Democrat side, it's probably Hillary by a hair as well.KISSEL: I think it's important to see how this field narrows after Iowa.  Will you see Ben Carson drop out? Could you see Carly Fiorina drop out?  Those other unnamed candidates in the undercard debate? Because that's going to help guys like Rubio who will do better I think on a smaller stage.ROLLINS: The most telling in this poll is first and second place, Trump has 28 percent, first, 7 percent second, gives him 35 percent of the base.  That's about what it is anywhere. 50 percent are against him, and somehow you got to break that up to get more people in the game.SHEINKOPF: It's a wise analysis. But Trump again created his own problem.  The expectation game is what makes Iowa so important. What reporters cover in this day determines where your money comes from and where your positioning is.BARTIROMO: And he set expectations.SHEINKOPF: The expectation he set was, look, I'm going to win, he needs to vanquish Cruz, he made himself, tried to make himself the evangelical candidate, he's playing the South Carolina long-term game. It may backfire.If he doesn't best Cruz or if he gets within close shot, people still say, by the way, Donald, we thought you had it. If he doesn't have it, he's got a problem.ROLLINS: To your point, who's going to drop out? The second biggest loser next to Bush who started as the frontrunner here is Mike Huckabee. Mike Huckabee already is planning to endorse Trump on Tuesday in Arkansas which doesn't help anybody anywhere.He's forcing -- in a typical fashion, he's forcing people to come to Arkansas as opposed to New Hampshire, a state he no longer lives in. He lives in Florida. So, I think to a certain extent, we'll see Mike out of the game --BARTIROMO: Wow. OK. So that's why Iowa is also important, because it's actually a narrowing of the field.ROLLINS: Yes, it is.BARTIROMO: Which is quite important.What did you think about this strategy of not showing up to the debate?  Did it help Trump? Did it hurt Trump? Was it a non-factor?KISSEL: We're going to know when people actually go to vote. A lot of people in Iowa don't make up their minds until caucus night. And so, we're really not going to have an answer to that question until we actually see people caucus.BARTIROMO: And real quick on the birth issue, does it matter for Cruz?ROLLINS: It doesn't because Trump keeps hammering, hammering, hammering it and a lot of people are uncertain. But I think at the end of the day, only about 22 percent say it matters at all. What matters equally important, the Goldman Sachs loans that he didn't report properly.I think at the end of the day, he was still front and center whether he was on the debate stage or not. So, I don't -- he's still dominated media which is what he's been from start to finish.BARTIMORO: We got to get into Hillary and Bernie coming up next.But first, despite being pretty far back in the poll, Senator Rand Paul says he will win Iowa. The presidential candidate will join me live in moments to explain why as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures."" Our panel returns after that.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SHAWN: From America's News Headquarters, I'm Eric Shawn.Here are some of the stories making headlines at this hour.The Syrian government says at least 45 people have been killed in three explosions in the suburb in a capital city of Damascus. An ISIS-linked website claiming credit for the attack, which reportedly started with a car bombing at a bus station followed by two suicide bombings. The carnage comes as the United Nations attempts to jump-start the Syrian peace talks in Geneva.Officials in Denver cancelling day two of the Colorado Motorcycle Expo after that fight broke out there yesterday. One person was shot dead, seven others were injured. It is still not clear this morning exactly what prompted that violence. Authorities say they are interviewing a person of interest and they're keeping tight security on the victims who remain at the hospital.For now, I'm Eric Shawn. Back to ""Sunday Morning Futures"" and Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Eric.Donald Trump along with Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have dominated the headlines heading into tomorrow's Iowa caucuses. But another GOP candidate believes he is the dark horse to win this race, despite polls showing him in the single digit territory.Senator Rand Paul says he's confident about his chances tomorrow. He says the polls are discounting the young voters of Iowa and he believes they hold the key to his victory.Presidential candidate and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is joining me now live.Good to see you, Senator. Thanks so much for joining us.SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Good morning. Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: So, what is the strategy to get those young people out and voting for you?PAUL: Well, you know, our goal is 10,000 college students. We've worked very hard on the college campuses. We have Rand Paul chapters at all 20 college campuses here. We have about 100 students in the headquarters for the last several weeks making phone calls. We've made over 1 million phone calls.So, we think we're going to surprise a lot of people. The polls really don't have very many young people in them because they're all on cell phones. We also think we're doing very well with independents.And we think after the last debate, see all these polls are before the last debate. We think we did well to point out differences and really hopefully to stoke our numbers.BARTIROMO: And do you think that your message of small government, libertarian, is resonating with this group? Because I know, Senator, as you know, the criticism about the small government and most GOP voters agree they want small government, not when it comes to the military. Not at this moment in time when we've got terrorists wanting to kill America.PAUL: Well, I think the real question is do we think regime change in the Middle East has made us safer or made us less safe. I would argue that toppling Gadhafi in Libya, which was supported by Rubio and Hillary Clinton didn't make us safer. That it led to chaos. It led to the rise of radical Islam.And this is still a big debate now in Syria. You've got the neo- conservatives that want to bomb both sides. They want bomb ISIS and they want to bomb Assad. My fear is that if you topple Assad, ISIS will become stronger.So, I think there really is a great debate going on in our party on what is the best strategy for moving forward.BARTIROMO: And what does that translate when it comes to money spent on defense? Pentagon, $600 billion budget. What should it be?PAUL: You know, if you look at balancing the budget, we borrow $1 million a minute. Really part of the problem is the right does want more military spending and the left wants more domestic spending. They get together and they raise both, but the taxpayer gets stuck with the bill.And so, really, if you are fiscally conservative, and I think I'm the only one, you do have to look at military spending. We spend $600 billion.  That's equal to Russia, plus China, plus eight more countries.Marco Rubio wants -- and Cruz frankly want $1 trillion more in military spending. That won't make us stronger. I think we can spend what we have and what we're spending currently and just spend it more wisely.BARTIROMO: Let me switch gears and I ask you a little more about economics here. Last week, we got more dreadful news. Durable goods orders for one indicating businesses are not investing in their plants and equipment and business. Durable goods down 5.1 percent. GDP anemic, up 0.7 percent.  What's the motion towards lever you could pull as President Paul in terms of getting growth moving in this country?PAUL: I think the biggest thing that's impeding growth is the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates below the market, so you get boom and then bust. We have the real estate boom caused by the Federal Reserve. Now, we have a stock market boom that I think we're on the edge of it collapsing or changing dramatically.If you want to have a strong country, you have to have strong currency.  But you have to get rid of price controls. Price controls don't work for bread. They don't work for food. They don't work for cars or oil.But price controls on the money don't work as well. They lead to misallocation of resources and ultimately to recession and a bust in the economic cycle.BARTIROMO: So, do away with the Federal Reserve?PAUL: Well, what I would do is I would audit the Fed to begin with. And then I would try to free up interest rates where they're not so directed and not so much under the thumb of the Federal Reserve. Then we can see what happens over time.But I think the Federal Reserve has too much power and a lot of their power has led to income inequality in our country and has led to the boom and bust cycle.BARTIROMO: Senator, real quick, we're going to talk with the panel in a moment about Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. What's your take on this latest e-mail news that 22 e-mail exchanges are deemed top secret, so much so that the public will not actually see that -- those e-mails along with the other e-mails that have been released.PAUL: I don't know how Hillary Clinton escapes indictment. I mean, if you treat her with the same sort of exactitude that they had for General Petraeus, I don't see how she's not indicted and how she doesn't end up with a conviction.I think this is worry some for Democrats in particular because if Hillary Clinton is indicted and becomes a criminal and ineligible for office, they're stuck with a socialist who I think whose ideas are actually indictable because socialism is such a failed economic system, I don't know how you're going to run in America, a country that's been made great by capitalism and say, oh, we want to become Cuba, or we want to become Russia. I just don't know how that message is going to resonate in our country.BARTIROMO: Senator, we'll be watching you trying to convince the younger voters of that very point, who many of whom believe Bernie Sanders is their guy.Good to see you, sir. We'll be watching all the activity tomorrow.PAUL: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Senator Rand Paul joining us.Let's get a look at what's coming up top of the hour, ""MediaBuzz"". Here's Howie Kurtz in Iowa.Good morning, Howie.HOWARD KURTZ, ""MEDIABUZZ"" HOST: Good morning from Des Moines, Maria.Well, we're going to look at the extraordinary amount of coverage over the war of words between Donald Trump and FOX News over him skipping the debate here the other night. We'll talk to Bret Baier and Chris Wallace for get behind-the-scenes look at the surreal situation without knowing until the final minutes whether the frontrunner was going to show up.Also, Ed Henry stops by to talk about this tight Hillary Clinton/Bernie Sanders race, the impact of the e-mail revelations that you just mentioned.  And as well as the press finally starting to scrutinize Senator Sanders who before didn't really think the guy was going to win, and wasn't getting as much media scrutiny -- all coming up here in Iowa.BARTIROMO: We're going to talk about that as well. See you in 20 minutes, Howie. Thanks so much.Remember when Hillary Clinton seemed like the inevitable Democratic nominee? Well, now, it is crutch time in Des Moines. She's in a virtual dead heat with Bernie Sanders. They both are scrambling to nail down voters before they turn out to caucus. The state of the race with one day to go with our panel, as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders barnstorming across the Hawkeye State, scrambling to pick up last-minute supporters and those crucial undecided voters. Check out this latest Des Moines Register poll. The two are virtually neck and neck, 45 percent of voters say Clinton is their pick for the Democratic presidential nomination, 42 percent say it's Sanders.Back with our panel now, Ed Rollins, Mary Kissel, Hank Sheinkopf.Mary, what do you think?(CROSSTALK)KISSEL: I think that Hillary's e-mail whoa woes are hurting her. I think Bernie Sanders comes off as an honest candidate. I think his attacks on her taking Wall Street money have hurt her. And frankly speaking, I think those on the left side of politics, they may be cynical, but they don't like to be lied to.I think the more we learn about this e-mail scandal, the more mendacious Hillary is. And, frankly speaking, Bernie profits from it.BARTIROMO: Hank, I did not realize she was paid $600,000 from Goldman Sachs for a speech. That was wow. Bernie Sanders got all the numbers and he's just campaigning with it.SHEINKOPF: Well, it's smart. He is the Barack Obama candidate of this cycle. He is talking about transformation. She is much more static.And the truth is, this is -- this whole political system is in such turmoil right now that Donald Trump is an insurgent on the right and Bernie Sanders looks fresh.BARTIROMO: Yes.SHEINKOPF: This is very -- something wrong here.BARTIROMO: Do you think this latest e-mail dump is going to hurt Hillary Clinton? I mean, 22 e-mails are top secret, according to the FBI.SHEINKOPF: Somebody started yesterday, there won't be an indictment.  Listen, you don't have to Clarence Darrow to understand that Deutsche, and others, Petraeus and certainly significant government officials and people have been indicted under conditions like this that may not have been as bad. The question here is when, and when does the Justice Department move and under what conditions? Not, is it possible?BARTIROMO: So you think it's when not if that gets indicted?SHEINKOPF: If this continues, if there's more leakage of it -- more of these things leak out. They don't leak out by accident, OK? This kind of discussion is not by accident. If this continues, how does she not receive the same treatment as others received?ROLLINS: There's 150 FBI agents investigating. And the head of the FBI is a very honorable man.BARTIROMO: Jim Comey.ROLLINS: And he was appointed to that because of his honesty.SHEINKOPF: Absolutely.ROLLINS: And he's going to get a recommendation I'm sure to indict her. I don't know whether the Justice Department will do it, and I certainly don't think the White House will do it.So, you're going to have the FBI who investigated thoroughly. This has all been publicly disclose or somewhat public disclose. I think whether she gets indicted or not is going to be not as relevant as the fact that she's been very dishonest in the course of her 30-year career. This will just totally reinforce it and the stories will be out there by 150 sources with these guys investigating it.BARTIROMO: Darrell Issa earlier on the show, Mary, said that the FBI wants to indict Hillary and Huma, her number two.KISSEL: Well, again, there's been a series of lies here. The server was just for personal use. She was only carrying one device. There was no classified information on it.We have four inspector generals reports coming out and saying, actually, no, that's not the case. Look, Jim Comey is an honorable guy. The integrity of the FBI is at stake. It's not a partisan institution.But likewise, the integrity of the Justice Department is going to be at stake if Comey comes out with a very comprehensive report and a recommendation to indict.ROLLINS: Just go back to the beginning. She couldn't find her Whitewater documents that had been subpoenaed. They were hidden in a closet in the White House and they find them three years later.That was a total violation of law and nothing ever happened to her. She's done this her whole life. There's been a pattern. The more that gets pushed in the forefront, the more relevant --SHEINKOPF: Whitewater is not going to be relevant. I don't agree with that. I do agree with Mary and that why --ROLLINS: No, I'm talking about the integrity issue.SHEINKOPF: This is not -- this is much more serious than anything that's come before it. This is about national security. And, by the way, people are going to pay attention to the words national security because we live in a period where people are feeling -- Americans are feeling obviously financially insecure and personally insecure. The terrorist threat is on that screen every day. That's why this has much more intensity.BARTIROMO: Is the party making plan B's or are they all in on Bernie Sanders, if, in fact, we were to see in an indictment? Does Biden, you know --SHEINKOPF: I don't think they know what to do any day. These parties -- let's remember they're really disorganized institutions much more so than in recent history besides.KISSEL: And let's say she doesn't get indicted, they still have a problem because Hillary is trying to run for the third term of Obama. So, her pitch to voters is a tough pitch. Hey, I'm going to do everything the last guy did who gave you 2 percent growth and complete global disorder.  There's nothing joyful by the way about Hillary's campaign. You know, they're sort of gutting it out like the Bataan death march.BARTIROMO: You would think that's the same argument for Biden. I mean, I know Biden is well-liked on both sides, but is that another continuation of Obama's presidency.ROLLINS: There's no youth in the Democratic Party. No one is going to baton ands move it forward. And I think the problem is both Clintons are very tired. She obviously is not moving anything forward other than this crisis that she's facing day in and day out. It's another terrible campaign and another terrible campaign will not be tolerated by a lot of Democrats who want to win again.SHEINKOPF: They're running the '92 campaign. The hope is that, by the way, it won't be so bad, but if she comes in behind Bernie and then she does well in New Hampshire, they can say, look, I'm the comeback candidate.BARTIROMO: Yes.SHEINKOPF: This is a repetition.BARTIROMO: Her answer in the NBC interview about the email scandal was just amazing. She said, ""Oh, it's like Benghazi.""We'll take a short break.The president will be welcoming a pair of top Republican leaders to the White House this week. What's on the agenda? We're looking ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures."" Back with those important meetings the president will have with Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.President Obama will be meeting with the top two Republican leaders of Congress this week. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will be at the White House this Tuesday. The three set to hash out legislative priorities for the election year, the president hoping to build upon the bipartisan budget agreement reached last year.Back with our panel.Ed Rollins, what do you think about this meeting? Anything to come out of it?ROLLINS: I don't think anything is going to come out. Ryan basically is a guy that has a plan. He wants to basically move us forward. McConnell has had a long history with the president, has been particular good. John Boehner thought the president was a liar and broken every deal they've ever dealt with.So, Ryan is coming in with good faith. We'll see whether he can make -- make anything on his agenda. If he can't, then you're going to go back to chaos. I don't think much is going to happen other than a photo-op.KISSEL: I don't think the president has done anything to build a relationship with either one of these gentlemen. Remember when he denounced Paul Ryan in public? He invited him to come in and talk about health care reform and then he publicly embarrassed him? Just as he embarrassed the Supreme Court justices, our conservative Supreme Court justices?So, there's not a lot of trust here and it's not for lack of trying on the Republican side.BARTIROMO: Hank, what do you think?SHEINKOPF: I think Ryan and McConnell have something smart. If the Republicans want to hold on to the Senate, the best way to do that, one of the ways to show they're not combatively stupid. That they're smart.Ryan gets the chance to show he's the youth, the face of the Republican Party, against all the old chaos going on in both party. And Obama gets to do what he really wants to do, which is play with the Republicans and hope that Hillary doesn't get here, but he has no interest of seeing Hillary Clinton being president.BARTIROMO: Well, this is an important meeting, particularly after this budget agreement, right, at the end of last year. Because the fact is, Republicans got mad at Paul Ryan for giving in too much.ROLLINS: They felt that it was Boehner's deal, they gave him a buy on it.  Because it was not something he had negotiated himself. If he negotiates something like this in the foreseeable future, he'll play a very heavy price.KISSEL: Well, look, you have to practice politics and the thing with the Ted Cruzes of the world, they don't want that, they just want to stand up and scream and yell and do nothing.And so, you know, kudos to Paul Ryan, he did get some reform in that budget deal. It wasn't all a bad deal.BARTIROMO: Yes.KISSEL: I think the sad thing about this president is that he came in with a lot of political capital. There were a lot of bipartisan reforms he could have done. Take corporate taxes, both sides of politics agree, it's very destructive that we have the highest corporate tax rate in the world.  Criminal justice reform, free trade, the Tran Pacific Partnership -- there's a lot on the table they could agree on. You just need the president to come to the table and deal.BARTIROMO: We just heard last week another company is moving to Ireland.  Right? Merging Johnson Controls and Tyco moving to Ireland because it's a better tax rate. So, you're right.KISSEL: Yes, yes.SHEINKOPF: That may all be true. But you know what politics and getting re-electing governs all. This is about what it looks, not what it may produce.ROLLINS: I don't think that's going to be much produced. I think tax reform is critical, AS I said in the show before. If Ryan had stayed as chairman, I think we would have it.SHEINKOPF: It's true.ROLLINS: I think today, it's going to be very, very difficult to get in this political year.BARTIROMO: But they all have plans for it. They're all talking about doing tax reform beginning in 2017. So --ROLLINS: We need it now.KISSEL: It's legacy making time for the president. What is his legacy?  Doing deals with Iran, Russia in Syria, Cuba and the Castros. So, he's probably looking at his last year in office and saying, well, how am I going to be remembered? It's a good question.ROLLINS: He wants to travel the world and be the Mandela, be more of an international --  BARTIROMO: Or he wants Hillary to name him to the Supreme Court.SHEINKOPF: Or control the Democratic Party the way the Clintons have done for the last 30 years.ROLLINS: He'll never control the Democratic --SHEINKOPF: I'm just telling you, maybe in his mind.(CROSSTALK)KISSEL: I don't think he'll ever go away. I think we're going to have President Obama pontificating about American politics for many, many decades to come.ROLLINS: In a very negative way.(CROSSTALK)KISSEL: In a negative way.BARTIROMO: Quick break. One thing to watch next. Stay with us on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Back with our panel with what's important next week.Ed, what do you think?ROLLINS: I think the market reaction to the bad quarter. I think that's going to be the important story than the Iowa elections.BARTIROMO: Iowa elections and, of course, we have earnings as well next week, Mary.KISSEL: Yes, that's right, Iowa as well. Not number one or number two but who's coming in number third, who's gaining momentum. And more importantly, who's dropping out of the race and who those votes are going to?BARTIROMO: Hank, real quick?SHEINKOPF: I'm looking at Mike Bloomberg, you know why? Because he may be the answer to independents and others alienated by both parties.BARTIROMO: Wow. Good to see you all.

"This is a rush transcript from ""Journal Editorial Report,"" April 18, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.STUART VARNEY, GUEST HOST: This week on the ""Journal Editorial Report,"" Hillary Clinton is off and running to the left, promising to take up the cause of everyday Americans and taking shots at hedge fund managers and CEOs. Is she a credible champion for the middle class?Plus, Marco Rubio joins what is shaping up to be a crowded Republican field, declaring that yesterday is over. So is he the face of the GOP's future?And the White House pulls its veto threat as an Iran vote moves to the full Senate. Did President Obama blink? Does he have Congress exactly where he wants them?Welcome to the ""Journal Editorial Report."" I'm Stuart Varney, in for Paul Gigot.Hillary Clinton kicked off a second presidential run this week with a move to the left, striking a populist tone as she vowed to work for, quote, ""everyday Americans"" while railing against overpaid hedge fund managers and CEOs.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  If you look across the country, the deck is still stacked in favor of those already at the top. And there's something wrong with that. There's something wrong when CEOs make 300 times more than the typical worker.  There's something wrong when hedge fund managers pay lower tax rates than nurses or the truckers that I saw on I-80 as I was driving here over the last two days.(END VIDEO CLIP)VARNEY: So is she a credible champion of the middle class? Let's ask Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman; and Washington columnist, Kim Strassel.Dan, is she a credible champion of the middle class?DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: The bigger question, is she a credible champion of herself. Hillary has her own believability problems. She's obviously a member of the 1 percent. And what Democrats are worrying about is whether she is going to make these political mistakes as she goes out there. If you want to attack rich people, that's one thing, but then to say that the average CEO makes 300 times more than the average worker when she's giving speeches for $250,000 to $300,000 a crack, that's a political mistake. I think as she goes forward, she's going to have to square the circle between the fact that she's a mega-celebrity, one of the world's most famous and rich people, running around the country claiming that she's the champion of truck drivers.VARNEY: So she's got a tough job positioning herself as the champion of the middle class?HENNINGER: She's not there yet.JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: Yeah. In terms of her pay and those speeches, on an hourly rate, most CEOs would love to get her rate. I think she is not that credible as a champion.Also, remember, when she in some cases was collecting these big checks from universities and when she was making her tour around the country speaking, there were some kids on these campuses saying, wow, that could have gone a long way toward tuition, for example, if Hillary had not been demanding such high speaking fees. So she's got some work to do to convince people she's a champion of the middle class.VARNEY: Kim, same question to you. Can she be a credible champion of the middle class?KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST: I don't even know how she can do this, Stuart. Here's the problem. Hillary Clinton has been out of elected politics for a long time now. She has spent all of those years positioning herself to be the inevitable nominee for the party in 2016. But while she's been out of this and busy doing it, the party has moved along. You now have a liberal wing that has crafted this agenda outside from her and handed it to her. And it was never what she was ever about. So she not only has the problem with her own wealth, this is a politician who has long had, when she's run for office, strong ties. She's going to be funded by private equity managers, hedge fund managers. And having to explain all of that I think is something that she's not necessarily ready to do because she was never prepared to do it.VARNEY: Kim, she's going to raise $2.5 billion. That's an astronomical amount of money. How do you square that with the middle class?STRASSEL: This is -- remember, the Clintons were the people that were actually sent out in this last midterm to go and help the kind of more conservative Democrats out there because that's the part of the party that they always represented. And now with pressure from Elizabeth Warren, the demand is that she run this very populist campaign. I'm not sure she's fluent with the language. And I think she carries a lot of baggage which is going to make it very difficult for her to do.VARNEY: James, she's got some things going for her, hasn't she?FREEMAN: Yeah, money. That's the biggest thing.(LAUGHTER)Yes, it's going to be awkward trying to appear like a regular person with all this money.(CROSSTALK)VARNEY: Hold on a second.FREEMAN: -- and that's the number people are talking about. That's more than Romney and Obama combined raised. It's so much that this week she brought on as CFO of the campaign, a former high-ranking Wall Streeter.  This is -- I don't know what the thinking is exactly but if the amount of money is so large that she's going to raise that you actually need a financial pro to manage the assets that are sitting in the campaign, this is a spending blitz that politicians have barely dreamed of.VARNEY: Look, I'm looking for some support for Hillary here, that she has got some things going forward.HENNINGER: She's got the Democratic organization. This is a huge and powerful --(CROSSTALK)VARNEY: That's a big deal.HENNINGER: Yeah. They're going to get out the vote. They're going to spend money. A lot of these billions will be spent on TV advertising to drive the message. The question is, the disconnect between Hillary Clinton and the message. As Kim has been suggesting, the progressives have decided that Hillary is going to basically be a stand-in for Elizabeth Warren.  It's going to be a left wing Democratic, big-government campaign. Can she push that across?(CROSSTALK)HENNINGER: Is that, in fact, what the middle class wants?VARNEY: Is that how you define the issues here? Big government, all government, all the time, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, versus Republicans, small government, market oriented policies. Is that how the whole debate is shaping up?HENNINGER: The debate is shaping up over an extension of the Obama policies of the last six years, which has created or at least occurred in an economy that has created a lot of middle class anxiety. Is more of the same going to alleviate that anxiety or is an alternative going to do it?VARNEY: Kim, doesn't Hillary Clinton want to get away from the Obama legacy? Are they shrinking middle class?STRASSEL: Well, this is her challenge. Probably, arguably, the smartest thing that she could do is start defining her differences with him because he's not necessarily a very popular president at the moment. The problem she has is she's got to run in a primary and she's got a left wing base that wants her to go even further than he has gone. Those are the tensions against her.Now, by the way, just to talk about, she does have built-in advantages, things like demographics. One thing that always helps people like Hillary Clinton, she's got the women's vote, she's got other factions of the Democratic community that are sitting there waiting for her to get them. Can she enthuse them to come out? That's one of her challenges.VARNEY: To be continued, everyone. Thank you.Still ahead, he launched his own bid for the presidency this week with a promise to reject the leaders and ideas of the past. So is Florida Senator Marco Rubio the candidate to take the GOP into the future?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Just yesterday, a leader from yesterday --(APPLAUSE)(BOOING)RUBIO: -- began a campaign for president by promising to take us back to yesterday.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: Yesterday is over.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)VARNEY: Marco Rubio, Monday, making his own White House run official and taking a swipe at Mrs. Clinton along the way. So is Florida's freshman Senator the new face of the Republican Party and the GOP's answer to Hillary in '16?We're back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel and James Freeman.Kim, to you first. Is he the man of tomorrow?STRASSEL: He has the potential to be. It's interesting that Marco Rubio was talking about yesterday. When he first came into the Senate, he was elected back in 2010, this was a guy who really was on fire, very much the kind of new breed of Republican reformer. He was out there talking about entitlement reform before most of the party would. He came in, he pushed through immigration reform, a smart immigration reform. I think the problem is Washington can warp people. He got enormous blowback after that immigration reform. And he has spent a lot of the last few years trying to make amends with the base and he has not been as bold as he once was. So we'll see which Marco Rubio ultimately comes out in this election.VARNEY: Where do you stand on this one, James?FREEMAN: I think Marco Rubio, if he had come along as a candidate for president in '08, 2012, I think Republicans would probably have eagerly embraced him. His problem now, I think, is this is -- to me, this is the strongest field since 1980 and you have -- you are going to have a bunch of governors with real records. You're going to have some very formidable candidates. He is a young career politician, very charismatic, very effective speaker, but not much -- similar to Ted Cruz, not much in the way of tangible achievements or experience. I think that's going to be a challenge as he gets on a stage with a bunch of the governors.HENNINGER: But, you know, I think Marco Rubio has tapped into something here that hasn't quite been recognized. When he starts talking about yesterday, he's standing there, everyone thinks he looks so young.  Well, half the electorate looks like Marco Rubio, right?VARNEY: That's right.HENNINGER: I think, I talked to a lot of these people, including younger conservatives. They're saying we really would like somebody from that generation and you've got a slate of candidates like Rubio, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, who are that generation, just as Barack Obama was. And Hillary Clinton is the only thing the Democrats have on the other side and, literally, he's right, she is yesterday.VARNEY: There is a battle going on within these candidates, within the Republican Party. The new faces of tomorrow versus some of the older faces of today and yesterday. That's a profound battle indeed, James.FREEMAN: And also, in a way, he's promoting in some ways the politics of yesterday though. His tax plan is not a bold, forward-looking proposal you might expect from someone with more youth and energy, which he obviously has. He's basically saying let's redistribute the credits but in a different way than Democrats. I think he's not talking about how do we grow the economy to the extent he should be.VARNEY: Hold on a second, James.Kim, come into this, please. I saw Rubio's tax plan. I thought it was relatively bold, lower top rate of individual income tax, lower the corporate top rate of tax. Isn't that relatively bold? Isn't that going for growth?STRASSEL: Some of it is. The corporate part of his tax plan is actually fairly bold and it would, for instance, and importantly, zero out taxes on capital gains and dividends. That is all about growth.The individual part is problematic. As James said, he has embraced this sort of branch of the Republican Party that believes that what we ought to be doing to get votes is to redistribute the wealth to people, to the middle class and say, here, here's more money, child tax credits, things like that. The problem that Rubio is going to have is that when that is placed next to, for instance, very simple flat-tax proposals by some of the other candidates, it does potentially look a little bit complicated and old-fashioned and not bold enough.VARNEY: But, Kim, doesn't it look more electable? When you've got Ted Cruz out there saying, put it all on a postage card, that's your tax return, now that is a radical proposal.STRASSEL: Look, behind this, the argument behind Rubio's thing is that we need to make a pitch to middle class voters, they don't really care about income tax cuts on the top rates, but they'll like it if they get more child tax credit money. The problem that Rubio has and the party has in going down that road is you cannot out-pander the Democrats on tax credits. Hillary Clinton is always going to be able to outbid him. Who is more electable then?VARNEY: Kim calls it pandering. I call it moderation because I think most Republicans want to win above all else.HENNINGER: Just think, a general point, Stuart. On the Republican side, you've got these young, attractive, articulate candidates competing with one another, saying interesting things. On the other side, you have one candidate, Hillary Clinton, who has got to keep her act afloat for the next 19 months. I think it gives the Republicans an inherent interest aspect here that is going to raise these candidates as they move forward.  It will be fascinating.VARNEY: As we said in the last block, to be continued.HENNINGER: Yeah.VARNEY: And, yes, we will.Now, when we come back, the White House drops its veto threat as an Iran bill moves to the full Senate for consideration. So is that a setback for the president? And does it really give Congress a say in a final nuclear deal?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)VARNEY: After months of resistance, the Obama administration said this week that the president would sign a bill giving Congress a voice in the proposed nuclear accord with Iran, backing off earlier veto threats after the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted unanimously Tuesday to pass the compromised measure. So is this a setback for the president in his quest to close a deal? Does it give Congress a real say in the outcome?Let's ask Wall Street Journal foreign affairs columnist, Bret Stephens.A broader question to start with, if I may. Is there any doubt in your mind that this deal will be signed by the president and it will go through?BRET STEPHENS, FOREIGN AFFAIRS COLUMNIST: There is, but for this reason. Look, when it comes to the president himself, it reminds me of that movie from the 1980s, ""Say Anything."" With President Obama it's ""sign anything."" He will sign any deal that he can get the Iranians to agree to.VARNEY: I'm sorry, I'm going to jump in. Does that mean that Congress has any real oversight after this arrangement?STEPHENS: Well, Congress will have political oversight. Whether they are going to be able to really stop a deal is a different question all together.But here's an important thing to note. I still hold that the supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini, is going to look for an excuse not to sign a deal for two reasons. One, ideologically, he is opposed to making any sorts of agreements with the Great Satan. It just goes against everything he's believed for 75 years of his life. But the second thing is, if the Ayatollah Khomeini walks away from the deal, Stuart, he knows that this president is so desperate that when they come back to the negotiating table six months from now, the concessions that we've made so far become the starting point, the baseline for the next round of American concessions, and what the ayatollah wants is immediate relief of all sanctions.VARNEY: Kim, what do you say? You're in Washington. You know that city very well. Is the president going to just sign anything?STRASSEL: More importantly, to go to your point, this piece of legislation does not allow Congress, in essence, to do anything to stop this. Look, they are going to pass this unanimously. By the way, it's always bad news when something passes unanimously in Washington. What it says is that Congress gets 30 days to review a deal. But in the end, Stuart, if even 41 Democrats -- the Republicans could say they disapprove of that deal, but if even 41 Democrats vote to block that, block a resolution of disapproval, there is nothing the Republicans can do about it. At the same time, though, this does allow Barack Obama to say, see, Congress got some sort of say in this. So he's getting political cover, which is why he decided that he would go ahead with this legislation in the end. It doesn't restrain him. It helps him.VARNEY: OK.Dan?HENNINGER: I think what's happening here, Stuart, with Congress is that this Iran deal is turning into the Obamacare of foreign policy, which is to say an initiative in which the Democrats are beginning to fall into line behind the president. This is the legacy at the end of his presidency just as Obamacare was at the beginning. And while, yes, they want to have their say, they've gotten enough of a big lead to say we do this kind of contempt vote but then the president does whatever he wants to do with the Iranians and we'll be there to support him at crunch time. It's their deal.(CROSSTALK)STEPHENS: I'm not sure the politics play the same way. ObamaCare was the make-or-break moment of the Obama presidency early in his time in office. This is a president on his way out.To Kim's point, I think it's going to look very bad for 41 Democrats to filibuster even what amounts to a symbolic vote. That's going to be a very, very tricky vote for at least several of those Democrats. Remember, there are only 44 Democrats, 46 if you count a couple of Independents, in the Senate. Several of those are going to be vulnerable, and having them filibuster is going to be bad politics. Chuck Schumer made a remark a few months ago in which he said, look, you know what, ObamaCare wasn't such a great thing for us Democrats looking at the way congressional elections played out. Becoming the president's foot soldiers in this bad agreement that I think a vast majority of Americans will feel very suspicious about is not going to be good for Democrats going into 2016.VARNEY: Look, if real oversight is virtually off the table, what about military sanctions -- not sanctions but a military attack as a last resort? The Russians are going to supply these air defense missiles.  Doesn't that neutralize any attack?STEPHENS: I think the chances that -- look, the United States, Russian missiles or no missiles, the United States has the wherewithal between E2 stealth bombers, Tomahawk cruise missiles, a whole variety of capabilities to take out Iran's nuclear installations. Iran is a third- world country trying to get 70-year-old technology. This is not a country that stands 10 feet tall. The problem is there's no political appetite to do it. There is certainly no appetite in the White House. If anyone is going to do it, it will be Israelis. And the question is, why haven't they done it yet.VARNEY: They're going to get a bomb, aren't they?STEPHENS: It looks like that.VARNEY: All right.We have one more break to take. And when we come back, out ""Hits & Misses"" of the week.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)VARNEY: Favorite time. Time for our ""Hits & Misses"" of the week.Kim, you are first.STRASSEL: A miss, Stuart, to all the liberal activists who have announced that they will engage in a hunger strike until the Senate confirms Obama nominee to attorney general, Loretta Lynch. Theatrics is fun but my advice is if they really want to get something done, they should go talk to their liberal friends in the Senate and advise them to stop filibustering bipartisan legislation. Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said he would be most happy to move the Lynch nomination just as soon as Democrats work with him to get some things done, and she probably has the votes to get through.VARNEY: All right.Up next, Bret Stephens?STEPHENS: This is a hit to Senators Orrin Hatch, Republican, and Ron Wyden, Democrat, along with Paul Ryan in Congress, for putting together a deal which will give the president fast-track authority to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade Agreement. It is one of the largest trade agreements in history. It would bind the United States and 12 countries in the Pacific region to a trade pact, which would involve 40 percent of the world's trade. It's a win for that side of the Pacific but it's mostly a win for our side of the Pacific, for our workers, for our manufacturing sectors, for our economy. We should pass this. It's the one good thing Obama may do in his presidency.VARNEY: It's a hit.All right, Dan, you?HENNINGER: Well, I would like to give a miss to whoever was responsible for stopping this guy in the toy helicopter for landing on the capitol lawn. A, he gave an interview to his hometown newspaper. He sent blast e-mails to the Secret Service. He was streaming it. Even that didn't prevent them from stepping in and stopping this guy before he hit with a potentially dangerous --VARNEY: They didn't see him for 80 miles of flight. Amazing.All right. Thanks, everybody.That's it for this week's show. Our thanks to my panel and to all of you for watching. I'm Stuart Varney. You can catch me weekdays on ""Varney & Co."" on the Fox Business Network.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone, I'm Greg Gutfeld; this is ""The Five.""A horrific scene outside New York City this morning, a commuter train coming in at a high rate of speed crashed upon arrival into a terminal in Hoboken, New Jersey. Killing a woman on the platform and injuring a hundred and eight. The train's operator was critically injured. He's said to be cooperating with the investigation. America's Newsroom Host Bill Hemmer is at the scene with the latest, Bill?BILL HEMMER, ""AMERICA'S NEWSROOM"" HOST: Hey, good afternoon, everybody. I'm live here in Hoboken here. Governor Cuomo earlier today said we don't know what happened and we don't know why, and they're trying to fill in that missing piece as to why now. The engineer listed in critical condition, but apparently he is cooperating. Hoboken is the last stop on a 26-mile commute that starts way up the Hudson River on the Westside in the state of New York, but Hoboken is where 250 commuters had planned to disembark and continue their commute under the Hudson River into Manhattan for a day of work. It has gone like that every day of the week, on schedule, without interruption.But today, something went terribly wrong, four cars being pushed by an engine. It was that force and drive of that last car that engine that pushed those cars into these commuters into the concrete barrier, the terminal in Hoboken that shattered as you saw the concrete and steel and glass literally fall around all commuters who are on board. There was one woman from Hoboken, she was on the platform. She is the only known fatality so far, and we believe that number will stay where it is. Witnesses describe this large sound, like an explosion, and then inside their breaking glass to get out of the cars. And one woman said she didn't feel brakes at all being applied, if that's the case, that was excessive speed coming into this station here. Governor Chris Christie, twice today said, there is no indication of anything, but a tragic accident. NTSB is going to brief in about 30 minutes and we'll have that live when it happens. Back to you guys now in the studio.GUTFELD: Thanks Bill. We'll check back in with you later. Now to the presidential race.It was all over the news: Someone has a weight problem.Trump. He just can't wait to respond.After Hillary hit him on comments about a beauty queen, what's he do? First thing in the morning, rather than meet with his advisers to assess his performance, he grabs the phone. Like a jilted ex, he went to air his side of the story, to people who will listen. Except he did it on air; yakking more about the lady's weight.And so what could have ended Monday night stretches into today. And it proves how vital preparation really is. The lesson: Hillary's camp did their homework and knew what would stick in his mind. They found the beauty queen, lobbed it his way and he swung right at it. Essentially, Hillary dug a hole and said, ""Hey Donald, here's a great hole to fall in!""Now we could list all the stuff we aren't talking about instead of this. It's so easy I could make it rhyme:Economic crisis, The war on ISIS.Decline of jobs, Roving mobs.Expanding automation, Unbridled immigration.Obamacare, The Russian bear.But, who's escaping pillory? Someone named Hillary.Yes, the more they talk about Donald, the less they talk about Hillary. To her credit, she turned Trump into her own best defender.Dana, from a communications standpoint .DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hmm.GUTFELD: Uh-huh. Did he get played?PERINO: Yeah, yeah. I think, well, clearly, I think that she had that ready to go whether it was perceived that she had won or lost the debate, because had she been perceived to have lost the debate, she could have tried to change the subject with this news the next day because we know that she laid a trap because we know that the miss universe, former miss universe had already done a photo spread with Cosmopolitan, she was prepped and ready to go, ready to go on all the shows. But, because she laid the trap in the debate, and he took it, then we are still -- let's see, this is Thursday, so we are still talking about that moment in the debate. And at this point, talking about the debate is not necessarily the best news for the Trump campaign. We'll get off with this fairly soon unless they want to keep it goingGUTFELD: Uh-huh.PERINO: And last night, Newt Gingrich was keeping it going.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: And I understand the desire to respond, but driving each other's negatives down is really the only way for them to seemingly get ahead.GUTFELD: You know Eric, we were talking a couple weeks ago about how Hillary was preparing a psych work-up of Trump and he had the biographer or his ghostwriter there and people wondered, is that really wise? It kind of help, right, to know where the weak spots are.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Can I just take a little issue with that. She laid the trap. I don't think she laid the trap. I don't think she -- what she did was skillfully turned it to her advantage. I think Lester Holt offered the trap when he said, ""Mr. Trump"" -- but remember, awesome these pressing things that you very eloquently outlined, things that are important going on the country, and we're talking about his tax returns, we're talking birth certificates. And then he said at one point, late in the debate, he says, ""Hey, Mr. Trump, what about when you took issue with the way she looks? Does she look presidential?"" I mean, that was the question that Lester Holt offered to Trump where he made a comment, and then she turned and said something like, ""Yeah, we're talking about looks."" Here's what I know about looks. Remember when you said this, so she was skillful turning into getting that talking point out there and then -- I guess he bit on it or whatever, who knows if he did or not. Again, I think that -- it was there is probably no place for that in that debate.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: I didn't see that, the reason to --GUTFELD: He kept going.BOLLING: For that to be one of the things. One of the --GUTFELD: He calls in. You know, he calls in the next morning into, you know people he know will listen to him and not, you know, come after him when he should, you know, maybe just let it, let it die, Kimberly, let it go.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Yeah, let it go, or say we really appreciate and, you know, love the miss universe program and the pageant, we've had some incredible women that have represented the country and other countries so well, and kind of like, leave it at that.PERINO: And then add, you know, the commander -- being the commander-in- chief is very different, Lester, to being the head of the miss universe pageant. I love that opportunity, that was great, but I'm focused on being president of the United States. Boom. Done.GUILFOYLE: No, it's goodbye to the relevant questions.GUTFELD: Juan, I still think Hillary set this whole thing up.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: I don't think there's any question. I think she had the beauty queen in the audience.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: I mean is, I don't think there's any question. She's --GUTFELD: That was a coincidence.WILLIAMS: Oh, was that right? I see. No, no, I don't have -- I don't think there's much doubt about it. And I think that Donald Trump is a guy that can't resist the feud. So it's the Khans, it's Rosie O'Donnell, it's the Mexican -- the judge, Indiana Judge from Mexican heritage. He just loves the fight. He's a schoolyard bully, that's what he likes to do. But to me, this is so amazing. I mean just, I mean, the idea that he would have called her miss housekeeping because she's a Latina heritage? I just, what? What are you doing? And then the whole business about going back after Rosie O'Donnell or as Dana mentioned, Newt Gingrich and Rudy Giuliani getting into this like, ""Oh yeah, you know, we're perfect"" or Trump saying, ""This is no Mother Teresa?"" I mean, really? Is, is Hillary Clinton's camp writing his lines? I mean, it makes you think when you know people come up to me sometimes I say, oh you know, think Trump was put in this by Hillary, so that the democrats -- I'm like, you're kidding, but now I'm like --hmm, maybe.GUTFELD: No, it's as -- if he, if he, he just needs to prepare. He needs to steal a page from her playbook for the next debate. That's what this is about. This is about how do you prepare for the next debate. And the next question is, will he keep, he keeps hinting at bringing up Bill Clinton's sex scandals. Do you think that's fair game?PERINO: Well, I think that from their perspective it would be. I think it's not helpful for the country and the future and like millennials are thinking, ""Wait, what are they talking about? This was 30 years ago."" But she brought it up -- she served up the ball, he'll want to hit it. I don't -- I don't know if it would be smart or not to do that, but she does have some things that she has said in the past about the women that were involved with Bill Clinton, I mean .GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: . to me --GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: Yeah. That's fair game, but the thing is, she has answered those questions a lot, over the years. So she's just kind of practiced at it, whether you agree with the answers or not, she does know how answer them.GUTFELD: But you know, you know Eric, we see these celebrity feminist come out and defend Hillary to the hilt, but you know, they never, they never talk about Juanita Broaddrick .PERINO: Right.GUTFELD: . or anybody else. So, shouldn't they be brought up? If you're going to champion Hillary's feminism, isn't it right to bring up that stuff?BOLLING: And both things happen 20 years ago. I mean, coincidentally, 20 .GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: . whatever, 22 years ago?GUILFOYLE: Uh-huh.BOLLING: . with Hillary --GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: . with Bill Clinton and this -- miss universe thing happened 20 years ago. Look, I've -- here we are day three and we're still talking about it, I guess, I guess speculating on whether he could. Look, if I'm with the Trump camp prepping him, say if they want to bring that stuff up again then, you know, they've been warned.GUTFELD: Uh-huh.GUILFOYLE: Well, it becomes relevant. You can make a turn on it. If she brings it up and discusses how he treats women .GUTFELD: Right.GUILFOYLE: . and then you say, well actually, look at what you've done to women and how you have made excuses for your husband and look at the women who you said horrible things about that made accusation against your husband. So he can turn it on that way and do it while it's still done in a tasteful way, but also kind of pointing out the hypocrisy of her statement of saying that she is on far higher ground than she is on these subject matters, and then it becomes like a race to the end to the finish. But nevertheless, that's where would slightly become relevant as just sort of like, you know, counterattack against her.GUTFELD: Juan, they both have the same similar flaws, don't they? I mean, there is --WILLIAMS: No, no --GUTFELD: No? Now it just --WILLIAMS: I'm just -- I'm very curious that to hear such smart people say, oh yeah, he fell into a trap the first time and then advised him to fall into the trap again.PERINO: I didn't advise him --WILLIAMS: Oh my, God. Because if he brings up this stuff about Bill Clinton's philandering and affairs and even allegations of rape, you know, this stuff is all tested. We know what American women think. You know what American women think -- it's beyond me because I screw up with women all the time, but I'm just telling you --BOLLING: Tell us. Tell us.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Tell us about American women, Juan. Yeah.WILLIAMS: I'm telling you, this is tested. And what it says that people say you know what, Hillary Clinton kept her marriage together and it's not her fault if her husband is a whacky guy who is abusive, whatever; that's his problem. And you shouldn't immediately connect it to her and blame her and make it a political baggage for her.GUILFOYLE: No, you only connect it to her as it relates to her comments and conduct and not his.WILLIAMS: That's fine, people say she's defending her family, she's defending her marriage, and people admire the idea she's been married 40 years .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: . versus a guy who's bringing cameras in to watch miss universe work out to embarrass and shame her because she's put on some weight.PERINO: I do think that if I'm -- so the next presidential debate on October 9th, it's a Sunday, we will have a live show right here, ""The Five,"" we'll be here. If on --GUTFELD: You sound thrilled by this.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: I am. It'll be fun because, what else are we going to do? We would be working at home .GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: . or we'll be working here? But if on October 10th, on October 10th -- 11th then October 12th, we are still talking about infidelity in either of their marriages. I think that that would be considered a failure for both campaigns. Trump's best attacks on her are about that she was an elitist, she's tied to Washington, she had a shady foundation, she did terrible things to the country, that's where he should hope to be able to talk, be talking about. That's the kind of ground he should fight on in those next weeks.GUTFELD: Plus, the media, we're suckers for this stuff. It's just more interesting than policy.PERINO: I love policy, though.GUTFELD: Yeah, but you -- you know --PERINO: I'm --GUTFELD: You like policy. I was going to say something else, but I already called you Elisa Simpson --PERINO: That I'm a ratings downer?GUILFOYLE: No.GUTFELD: No.GUILFOYLE: Policy wonk, because --GUTFELD: Policy wonk, that's what I wanted. But we, we, we go for -- this is catnip, political catnip. All right .GUILFOYLE: It is.GUTFELD: . Trump's got a new catch phrase. I didn't know this, a new catch phrase to attack Clinton. You'll hear it, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Donald Trump has rolling out a new line of attack to commits voters. Hillary Clinton is not fit for the job.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(APPLAUSE)DONALD TRUMP, PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton, sometimes referred to as Crooked Hillary .(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: . can be understood with a simple, but very important phrase, ""follow the money."" The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class, they're donating to Hillary Clinton, follow the money. She put the office of secretary of state up for sale. And if she ever got the chance, she'd put the oval office up for sale too.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: KG, that phrase, it kind of rings a bell.GUILFOYLE: I knew a guy, one time, that had a show called ""Follow the Money"" on FBN. Look at the great phrase, as Greg has told us this is a phrase that's been around for a long time, but you know, it does resonate. When you say that follow the money, follow the trail, we talked about it as it relates to national security, et cetera. When you talk about follow the money trail, how his life suspending itself, OK, how do the Clinton fund themselves? They never met other people's money they didn't like. Look at the Clinton Foundation, and now he's making that tie into say, OK, will they allow influence pedaling as well if she gets back in the White House. It's that type of connection that they're trying to make to say, corruption, undue influence, selling the office of the highest bidder in terms of access, and we saw that when she's secretary of state that 60 people got meetings that, in fact, gave money to the Clinton Foundation.BOLLING: Dana, and there's somewhere a hundred -- if you go to the Clinton foundation website, you can look up names and what on sold (ph) set of range of what they donated. And Trump points out, somewhere around a hundred and million dollars came into the Clinton Foundation from ""Wall Street.""PERINO: Yes, so I think I said on the A-block that on October 9th, 10th and 11th, this should what he should be talking about. I think that -- follow the money is a much better chant phrase for the crowd and at Trump's rallies than lock her up, which is what they were started chanting up a rally today. I think this would be a much better place to -- to a, to -- to try to get Bernie Bros? Remember like, they don't like this kind of thing at all. But I also think the turnabout is fair play and that one of the things that Hillary Clinton can turn around and say, ""You can follow -- we've love to follow the money, but you won't release your taxes.""GUILFOYLE: Tax.PERINO: And you get back on talking on that ground. So, it's a little bit there (inaudible).BOLLING: Greg, you like this little dainty is got going on there?GUTFELD: I think it's, I think it's always good to, to stick to -- get away from the (inaudible) go for this stuff, but he's doing it in front of an audience that already likes it. Like he's got -- it's like he -- it's almost like therapy, you know, he finds a comfort zone and he -- this is something that he should have done really hard on the debate with specifics and done this kind of stuff. This stuff -- he already knows these people like him. He needs to convince voters and not already convince the apostles.BOLLING: Hmm. I will point out that the networks broke away from commercial to take this speech when he unrolled, rolled out, to follow the money, the new name, new line of attack. You like it?WILLIAMS: I like that. I think that the networks love Donald Trump. I mean, he is a ratings grabber. Everybody likes to watch Donald Trump, even if you're not planning to vote for him, he is just so entertaining.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: But do I think that this is going to be a winner? No, I think Dana gave my response, which is that you can imagine Hillary Clinton sitting there and say, ""Oh, so what about your taxes, Mr. Trump? What about the people that you stiffed and never paid? You want to follow some money?""PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: ""Let's talk about these issues."" So the debate was a disaster. I mean, it was just terrible. I mean -- and the polls now that have come out had made it clear, republicans, I know around here, at this network sometimes people don't to want say he lost, but I'm telling you, it's not a question at all.BOLLING: But the polls haven't really moved --WILLIAMS: Oh, the polls?(CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Come on, Eric.BOLLING: There was stood that the L.A Times tracking poll hasn't hired them prior the debate, but that, that's OK. Juan points something out, ""Trump, release your taxes."" Should he do it before the election?GUILFOYLE: Well, he made the call to Hillary called her out and said, ""I'll release my taxes if you release your e-mails. You know, the 33,000 that you deleted and did the entire"" -- no, no.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Al right. Well, there you go.BOLLING: There it goes.GUILFOYLE: Bleach is effective. So --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Then he made that deal, right? But she's not going to do that.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: So then he's going to say he's not unilaterally going to do it because he's already sticking by his story --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: So I wish he would have said .(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: . rather than the 33,000 e-mails. I wish she would have said along the same lines, the mind speaking of following the money --GUILFOYLE: ""Wall Street"" speeches.BOLLING: Well, she -- let me take a transcript of the ""Wall Street"" speeches.GUILFOYLE: Transcript (inaudible).BOLLING: I want to know he told Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citibank, who he loaned hundreds of billions of dollars to bail them out.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: What are you telling them?PERINO: Wow.BOLLING: What are you going to tell them going forward? Anybody? No. All right --GUILFOYLE: I think that's a good one.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: That's what I said, yeah --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: No, but --PERINO: I don't think of the --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: I think the taxes part is an interesting one. I mean it -- just looking to the future of presidents, presidential candidates, I don't think it's a good idea to normalize the concept that you can get out of releasing your taxes because it is an official government document. It is what candidates have done, it informs a lot of Americans, both republicans, democrats, libertarians, Green Party, whoever. I don't think it's a good idea to normalize that behavior and I think he should release his taxes.BOLLING: All right. Are we good?PERINO: Yes.BOLLING: Good to go. Last night, the Gold Star mom confronted President Obama of why he still won't use the term Islamic terrorism, his stunning response, coming up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Tina Houchins son gave his life while fighting radical Islamist terrorism for this country. Last night, the Gold Star mom asked an important question directly to the president. If terrorist link their acts to Islam, why won't he call it Islamic terror? Here was his answer.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: What I have been careful about when I describe these issues is to make sure that we do not lump these murderers into the billion Muslims that exist around the world, including in this country, who are peaceful, who are responsible, who in this country are our fellow troops and police officers and firefighters and teachers and neighbors and friends.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Then, the president took a veiled swipe at Donald Trump for using the language that he won't.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: The dangers where we get loose in this language, particularly when a president or people aspiring to get president -- become president get loose with this language, you can, you can see in some of the language that we use, in talking about Muslim-Americans here and the notion that somehow we'd start having religious tests in, in -- who can come in the country and who's investigated and whether the bill of rights applies to them in the same way. And that's a slippery slope.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Slippery slope. Al right, Greg, what do you make of it?(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: You know what gets me about this? He thinks so little of us as a country that we aren't actually doing the lumping of people. We are actually doing the differentiating. We're saying, radical Islam is part of Islam, we are not doing the lumping, he's actually doing the lumping by not differentiating. And it's also -- it's will, it's a willful blindness that's becoming like legitimately real blindness. If a doctor is treating cancer, he's not going to call it indigestion, you know, you have to know what it is and radical Islam is a cancer within Islam. That is not lumping. That's distinguishing. And he refuses to do that. He's the lumper.GUILFOYLE: He is weakening our immune system.BOLLING: You didn't hear the dog whistle in that?GUTFELD: No.BOLLING: You didn't? Did you hear when he said, ""We can't lump the billion Muslims around the world that are peaceful, whatever, loving Muslims."" There are 1.2 billion Muslims. He's calling 200 million Muslim, not peaceful.GUTFELD: Hmm.BOLLING: Maybe those are the -- Islamist he's talking about. Did you get that?PERINO: No.BOLLING: You didn't get that?PERINO: I mean no, actually I get it.BOLLING: You don't believe it? You're not buying it?PERINO: I'm not buying it.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: So, yeah --GUILFOYLE: It was like, right, dog whistle.PERINO: Nice try, though.GUILFOYLE: Dog whistle. All right. What would Jasper say, dog whistle? OK.PERINO: Well -- sort of feels that -- I don't understand what President Obama is protesting, because at this point it feels like we are angels dancing on the head of the pin. And that the argument seems so false to me, but he was (inaudible) --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: . arguments so much because he wants to be right when -- it feels like we all kind of agree, but we all just keep going around until you won't say radical Islam, just because you say about Islam, that doesn't mean that you think those .(CROSSTALK)PERINO: . people are not peaceful Muslims, but he -- I'm sure that he has been told early on in the administration by the Intelligence community, and probably the State Department, that it would be unhelpful to American interests abroad if the United States was seen to be lumping all Muslims together as terrorists.GUTFELD: But we --PERINO: I'm sure that's what he's thinking.GUTFELD: But we don't. That's the thing.PERINO: I know that -- I agree with your argument, that's why I'm saying I think that, this is a stupid argument.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, I mean it's like -- that was not a good moment for President Obama who generally speaking is an eloquent man. That's - I don't think that's winning him many hearts and minds, Juan.WILLIAMS: Sure, I don't mind. I just thought -- I thought it was quite eloquent. I mean, I mean -- to me, the part that he said that was really impressive was he said listen, when you talk to people who are Muslim, and they hear us, especially the president of the United States using language, talking about radical Islamic terrorism. They feel personally as if you're talking about all of Islam. They show it's not about what we think, Greg.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: It's about how the rest of the world would perceive our president speaking to them as the leader of the free world, engaged in a war against terrorism that requires us to rely on our Muslim allies.GUTFELD: And I think we do. We do rely on our allies, but we shouldn't worry about how the world perceives us.PERINO: And coddle the allies.WILLIAMS: I think it's important that you have to respect your allies. I don't -- why would they cooperate with you if you disrespect them?GUTFELD: Because they don't -- their feelings are hurt?GUILFOYLE: No.GUTFELD: We have people dying.WILLIAMS: No, it's not a matter of feelings if you have a billion Muslims in the world.GUTFELD: I'd respect...WILLIAMS: You know what? You don't want to start a fight with them.GUTFELD: I think they're smart enough to know that we're differentiating.GUILFOYLE: Yes, I think so. And by the way, they are subjected to the same acts of radical Islamic terrorism. And believe me, they know it and they're not afraid to say it. So this is all conjured up in Obama's head.Switching gears to something that's never happened in the history of Obama's presidency, yesterday Congress successfully overrode the president's veto of the 9/11 Bill that allows families to sue Saudi Arabia for any role in the attacks. The president is very disappointed.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think it was a mistake, and I understand why it happened. It's a dangerous precedent, and it's an example of why sometimes you have to do what's hard.And frankly, I wish Congress here had done what's hard. I didn't expect it, because voting -- if you're perceived as voting against 9/11 families right before an election, not surprisingly, that's a hard vote for people to take, but it would have been the right thing to do.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: The bill is now law, and our defense chief warns it could have a devastating impact on our military. So Dana, how do you assess this situation?PERINO: Well, I do think that former attorney -- I think the president is right, and it's hard for me to say that. I have friends, we all have friends that lost loved ones in the attacks, and so it's not easy to say that, but I do think that former attorney general Michael Mukasey makes President Obama's case very effectively...GUILFOYLE: And he did today on the channel.PERINO: Was he on the channel?GUILFOYLE: Yes, he was.PERINO: To have foreign governments conflate what terrorists do to what we do, we know that Spain, Belgium, Italy, they have tried to bring lawsuits against our intelligence community and our military for things that they think we have done that is wrong. And sovereign immunity has protected those Americans.I do think that President Obama and the White House legislative team probably deserves some of the blame here, because they've talked about this way too late. They thought that they would be able to handle it. It got away from them. And now they have this situation on their hands. Not only is it embarrassing to the president, but as the secretary of defense said, it also could be very damaging to the United States.But, I guess we'll see how it goes.GUILFOYLE: Eric, you have friends and people that you were very close to. And you were down there for 9/11. I know it's very personal to you. How do you feel about this?BOLLING: I think it goes beyond that, though. I like the idea of being able to sue, just basis I like more transparency. I want to know what's going on; I want to know what all the facts are, all the evidence, some of the stuff is hidden, the evidence is hidden under the sovereign immunity laws. And I'd like to see it more transparent more open.And I'm trying to -- just tell us what the risk is, like to the military. I honestly, I'm being serious, I don't understand.PERINO: OK. For example -- OK, so for example, after, during the war on terror, let's say there was an interrogation that happened overseas. And it was one that, when it became known to the public that it was happening overseas and that we were having cooperation with governments, just say it's country X, and country X gets embarrassed. And politically, domestically they look like they're in trouble.So what they then tried to do was to interrogate, basically and hold American citizens who were doing the interrogation work, was legal and allowed for them to do, but then they tried to change the law because of sovereign immunity, you're able to get those Americans back onto U.S. soil and to keep them safe from those lawsuits.WILLIAMS: It's our agents. I mean, it's our agents who are over there...GUILFOYLE: The intelligence community.WILLIAMS: Yes. Working for us, if they break a law, all of a sudden, hey, they're subject, our government is subject to lawsuit. If we are using the drones, for example, and some country says, ""Oh, you know what? You destroyed property. You killed some civilians.All of a sudden, they're -- and not only that.GUILFOYLE: They all have different laws.WILLIAMS: The heart of this story really is, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker, all saying. ""Listen, you know, we had to do this, but we know it was wrong."" What?PERINO: I know.WILLIAMS: Holy smokes. Talk about political cowardice in America tonight. That's -- you know, you like conspiracies.BOLLING: But Juan, they're being consistent.WILLIAMS: This is not a conspiracy. This is pure political cowardice.BOLLING: So -- OK, so therefore, where do you stand on the NSA?WILLIAMS: On the -- what do you mean?BOLLING: On the NSA? Do they break the law. Are they breaking -- are they being unconstitutional or were they when they were data mining innocent Americans?WILLIAMS: Of course. What do you mean? We don't like that. We can have a constitutional argument. That's not relevant to this.BOLLING: All right.WILLIAMS: When you have GE, Dow Chemical, the chairman of the joint chiefs, the CIA director saying this harms American interests, there's no way -- all you're doing is saying it's politically popular, because everybody's sympathetic to the families.GUILFOYLE: Right, I know.WILLIAMS: But it's not realistic in terms of our national interests.BOLLING: I still find the consistency in it.GUILFOYLE: Juan, I've got to get Greg in here.GUTFELD: The argument is that they'll risk cooperation, in terms of security, with a military ally. I suspect the first, what, two minutes of the segment just bashing President Obama over his cowardice over using the phrase ""radical Islam."" I think he might have a point here. Especially when 30 senators, after overriding the veto, 30 senators sent a letter to alleviate the consequences of the legislation.So, the people that actually vetoed it are going, there are some serious problems here. So I guess what I'm saying is this is the most complicated issue that we've ever talked about. I think, because you have true suffering from the victims of 9/11. These families are true suffering. And you have this bill that could lead to more suffering abroad. And we have to sit there and you have to think about there's a political answer and there's a moral answer. What the hell do you do?PERINO: Right.GUTFELD: And you're doing it in four minutes on a cable show.GUILFOYLE: Yes, and guess what? And you're potentially compromising the ability for the intel community to be able to gather intelligence to prevent another 9/11.WILLIAMS: Thank you.GUILFOYLE: Complicated. Prepare yourself.BOLLING: It baffles me that you even have this opinion on this issue and the opposite opinion with the other, with the NSA issue. It's just -- it's just -- blows my mind.GUILFOYLE: Commercial break, we're going to go over that.Prepare yourself, because coming up, you are about to bear witness to a presidential campaign in complete self-destruction mode. Gary Johnson unable to answer yet another seemingly simple question on live TV, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: The election now 40 days away, and it's not looking good for Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson. Fresh off his ""What is Aleppo?"" disaster. Johnson drew another on-air blank yesterday. This one, sort of dumbfounded, even more so than the last.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC HOST: Who's your favorite foreign leader?GARY JOHNSON (L), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Who's my favorite...MATTHEWS: Just name anywhere in the country. Any one of the continents, any country. Name foreign leader that you respect and look up to. Anybody.JOHNSON: I guess I'm having an Aleppo moment in the former president of Mexico...MATTHEWS: But I'm giving you the whole world.JOHNSON: I know. I know.MATTHEWS: Anybody in the world you like. Anybody. Pick any leader.JOHNSON: The former president of Mexico.MATTHEWS: Which one?JOHNSON: I'm having a brain -- I'm having a brain freeze.MATTHEWS: Name anybody.JOHNSON: Cedilla.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Oh boy. On another attempt to reverse the damage, Johnson tweeted today -- and here I'm quoting, I'm not making this up: ""It's been almost 24 hours, and I still can't come up with a foreign leader I look up to.""GUILFOYLE: Yes, there are no words.WILLIAMS: Where do we go? OK. I don't know.GUTFELD: There are words.GUILFOYLE: Like when he was here, and I was speechless. When I asked him a few questions about national security and foreign policy, and it was just, I mean, wow. I couldn't even believe it.WILLIAMS: What do you got to say?GUTFELD: I just -- I feel for William Weld. You know, he's like the good cop that's saddled with the crazy partner, you know, or he's the spouse with an obnoxious husband who embarrasses you at parties.And also, Gary cannot say he had an Aleppo moment. That's for other people to say. Because he had the Aleppo moment. You follow me?WILLIAMS: But why did he tweet that tweet? I mean, OK, so when...GUTFELD: Trying to be funny, I guess.WILLIAMS: ... I saw this, at first, I thought, you know, people are just kind of jumping on Gary Johnson, because I mean, OK, not every American's going to know the name of every great foreign leader. Give him a break.But then to tweet again that ""I celebrate my stupidity and ignorance and the error,"" I don't get it, Dana.PERINO: Well, there is no mercy rule in presidential politics, so I think that the Libertarians would want one for this year. I feel bad for Libertarians.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: I thinks like they have a lot of arguments to make.GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: This was a year when they could have really had an impact.GUILFOYLE: What a wasted candidate.PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: Literally?GUILFOYLE: Like I told you earlier, something's not right.PERINO: I like him very much, but he does seem to have this cavalier attitude that he doesn't really care. He's like the honey badger of presidential candidates.GUILFOYLE: Honey badgers are tenacious and ultimately attain their target, despite being flung 1,000 times, and they come back to life, which I kind of admire.PERINO: True.GUILFOYLE: That ain't this guy.WILLIAMS: Yesterday we were talking about millennials being a problem with Hillary Clinton. In fact about a third of people 18 to 34 say they would vote for Gary Johnson.BOLLING: Yes. And that's the problem. The millennials, the protest vote they call it, it's been Johnson and Stein. And as these Aleppo moments. By the way, I think the tweet was supposed to be funny, tongue in cheek. Like, I still don't care finding someone that I can look up to part of it. Even though he was deer in the headlights.PERINO: Hashtag #sarcasm.BOLLING: He was deer in the headlights, clearly.The sad part is look, in 2008, 49 percent of millennials turned out vote. In 2012, 41 percent turned out to vote. Now they're saying these two candidates, Hillary and Donald Trump, are uninspiring. That number could drop below 40, 35 percent. I mean, the millennial as a voting block is becoming less and less important.GUILFOYLE: Couldn't he have picked, like, one of the former leaders or somebody...BOLLING: Anybody.GUILFOYLE: Mexico.BOLLING: He didn't have it. Kimberly, he didn't have it in his pocket. I mean, he's running for president.GUILFOYLE: This is what I'm saying. You guys want to be, like, ""Smoke some marijuana."" Doesn't work out so well, does it? I'm telling you.BOLLING: You can't blame weed for the fact that a guy who's running for president doesn't -- can't name one foreign leader.GUILFOYLE: And where is his campaign? Up in smoke. Up in smoke.GUTFELD: He should have said, ""Two liters of Mountain Dew.""GUILFOYLE: Wow.WILLIAMS: Wow. But in -- wow.GUILFOYLE: Next.WILLIAMS: This is the week of no preparation, fellows, come on.GUILFOYLE: Gary Johnson.WILLIAMS: Next, we return to the scene of today's deadly train crash outside New York City. The latest developments from Bill Hemmer, straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: We to want go back now to the deadly train crash this morning outside New York City. At the height of the morning rush hour at one of the busiest transportation hubs in the northeast.One person was killed, and we are now learning, at least 114 are hurt. The NTSB just announced that the engineer has been released from the hospital.Bill Hemmer has been at the scene all day. He is here with us from Hoboken, New Jersey.Bill, as the day wraps up, any observations about how many people are injured? The number has gone up from 108 to now 114.BILL HEMMER, CNN ANCHOR: I think the best news about all that, Dana, is there were dozens and dozens who were considered walk-ins to the medical center here in Hoboken, and many of them have been released. And they will -- they'll be spending the evening with their family at home tonight.That's quite remarkable when you look at the extent of damage on some of the pictures and images we've been showing you.I think two significant developments just a couple of minutes ago, No. 1 about the engineer. Four hours ago, the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, said he was in critical condition. Cooperating, but in critical condition.And now we learn, confirmation from the NTSB just moments ago, that that engineer has been released from hospital, and he will be set to be interviewed -- at what point, we don't know -- by the NTSB. Wow. What a recovery for him.The other bit of news: there are recording devices on the locomotive. There are recording devices on the front car, as well, where that first car left the track and went airborne. That they will be looking at them very closely to try and find answers. And speed is clearly an issue, why it was going so fast, we don't know...BOLLING: Bill, quickly, any information on the engineer beyond his status right now at the hospital? In other words, do we have his health history, and/or his safety history?HEMMER: We do not, Eric. Great questions on both. That has not been nailed down.Frankly look, we're seven or eight hours into this right now. The NTSB has been a little tight with the information. You can understand that.The mayor here in Hoboken, she first came to office in 2009, so that was right around the time when Sully landed the U.S. air flight just off -- just off the east shore of Hoboken. She said at that point, it took weeks to give the public answers. And already, just a moment ago, the NTSB said they'll be on site for seven to 10 days.As to his history, we don't have it yet. There's some rumors about his name out there, but we haven't nailed that down, Eric.PERINO: All right. Kimberly, one last question.GUILFOYLE: Yes, I've got to follow up real quick on that.
