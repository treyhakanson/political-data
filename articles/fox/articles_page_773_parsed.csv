1	1	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/22/bill-oreilly-hillary-dilemma/	Bill O'Reilly: The Hillary Dilemma	"No matter what kind of controversy engulfs Hillary and Bill Clinton, they have a ready defense -- ""The Clinton haters are at it again."" And there is some validity to that defense as the Clintons are the most controversial couple in America and perhaps in the history of this country.In general, a big mistake the Clintons make is that they don't admit mistakes. For example, Benghazi. All former secretary of state Clinton had to say was that security in Libya was very difficult, that she and her staff didn't pay close enough attention to the threats that were brought to their attention. That's a painful admission, but mistakes do happen.Libya's a backwater. Secretary Clinton was gallivanting all over the place so her admission and deep apology most likely would have been accepted by most fair-minded people. Instead, instead Hillary Clinton and President Obama stone walled, angering millions of Americans.On the e-mail front, there's no excuse. It was a calculated deception -- everybody knows that. The calculation the Clintons are making is that most voters won't care.Now on to the latest brouhaha -- a new book will present circumstantial evidence that Hillary Clinton profited from her position as secretary of state. She did this because her husband made an enormous amount of money on the lecture circuit while she was in office. Also there is evidence that Clinton may have acted favorably to some concerns that donated big money to the Clinton Foundation. While a designated charity, the foundation pays an awful lot of bills for Bill and Hillary as well as for their daughter Chelsea.Talking Points doesn't know if there's overwhelming evidence of donations for favors. Already some are saying Mrs. Clinton should be indicted like Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey. At this point, that's a gross overstatement and one that actually helps the Clinton campaign.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PODESTA: It's a book that's written by a former Bush operative who's a reporter for that august news organization, Breitbart.com, or has been in the past. He's cherry-picked information that's been disclosed and woven a bunch of conspiracy theories about it. The facts -- there's nothing knew about.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: The author of the book Peter Schweizer did help President Bush the Younger write speeches. He is also an editor-at-large at Breitbart News a conservative Web site. But that does not diminish what Mr. Schweitzer is writing.Again, the charges will have to be vetted. And big media such as the ""New York Times"", the ""Washington Post"" as well as Fox News are doing just that.One bad sign for Hillary Clinton is that a character assassin, David Brock, is now being used by her campaign to attack the credibility of the book. There are few Americans lower than Brock, who is a known hater and smear merchant. If the Clinton campaign is going to use people like Brock, major problems will develop.With the Democratic Party fully committed to Hillary Clinton, all of these controversies will get attention, but in the end it comes down to you -- the American voter. We are living in a country that is now largely fed up with politics, and many have turned away from public policy, descending into trivial pursuits mostly in the social media.So it is easier to overcome dubious situations than it used to be. Talking Points will be fair to Hillary Clinton, but right now her profile has been damaged and she needs to address all the controversies with serious media people and soon.And that's ""The Memo"".Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years. He joined the network in 1996 and is based in New York. Click here for more information on Bill O'Reilly. "	['Menendez', 'Clinton', 'Obama']	[]

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: Thanks for staying with us, I'm Bill O'Reilly in the ""Weekdays with Bernie"" segment tonight. Let's get right to the purveyor of BernardGoldberg.com which joins us from Miami.All right. First up, media reaction to the Trump interview. Anything catch your eye?BERNARD GOLDBERG, BERNARDGOLDBERG.COM: Yes. I was absolutely stunned by the amount of coverage given to the interview. I could be wrong about this, but I think there was more coverage of your interview than when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon. I may be a little off on that. It was all over the place. And in very important places. It was on the networks, the ""New York Times,"" ""The Washington Post,"" all over the internet, of course, but there was one thing, one thread that ran through almost all of the stories that I either read or saw. And that is the interview, Bill, was covered as entertainment, as a show. Not as politics.Donald Trump is running for president of the United States but it was covered like fight night on the FOX News Channel or shootout at the O.K. Corral. Listen, I've used this term before and forgive me for using it again. But the United States of entertainment and that's where we live whether we like it or not. In the United States of entertainment. Entertainment is king and that interview was pretty entertaining and that's why it's received the massive amount of coverage that it has.O'REILLY: All right. But there is another reason why it was covered as entertainment was because the liberal newspapers our competition on cable and on broadcast doesn't want you to give FOX News legitimacy. So, they know as I said in the talking points memo that many consider us the most powerful news agency in the world. You don't want to give us more credibility so that if they have to cover us and they did, they are going to cover us in an entertainment or snarky way. Would you disagree with that?GOLDBERG: No. There was some snarkiness. There is no question. And I would offer up this advice. Take a vanilla milk shake. Take a sip of it. And then follow the advice you gave Donald Trump. Turn the other cheek and forgive these people who have been snarky to you.O'REILLY: I didn't make a big deal of it. And I'm glad youGOLDBERG: I know.O'REILLY: Absolutely the best. Now, the reason that I injected the vanilla milk shake into the debate so if people don't know. And there was actually a picture in the daily news, New York Daily news of me sitting at Yankee stadium with Trump and both of us drinking vanilla milk shakes. Now, a lot of people didn't know what I was talking about. But what I was trying to do was use a sense of humor to Trump because I knew he would get it right away to cajole him into being responsible and showing up at the debate so people could take his measure.GOLDBERG: Right.O'REILLY: I don't drink, Trump doesn't drink. So we are at the game, instead of getting beers, we get milk shakes. And inevitably I wind up paying for them. All right. So, that's what -- that was all about.GOLDBERG: But for months you have been saying that one of the reasons Donald Trump is successful is because he doesn't care what anybody thinks. And last night he proved that he doesn't even care what you think. No matter how much you try to guilt him --O'REILLY: Right.GOLDBERG: You tried to guilt him with those vanilla milk shakes. It didn't matter.(INAUDIBLE)O'REILLY: It didn't matter.GOLDBERG: I mean, you talk about his independence and his toughness. He showed the evidence of that last night. The milk shakes didn't matter. The cajoling, the imploring, the beseeching, none of that mattered.O'REILLY: But he didn't have a good --GOLDBERG: For all I know Donald Trump.O'REILLY: There is more to it though.GOLDBERG: Knowing Donald Trump, he may still show up at this thing before it's all over. But --O'REILLY: You know who is the man behind the curtain and here he is, it's what's my line. But what I wanted him to do and what he didn't do and this is what politicians do all the time was say, look, I said you owe it to the country to do this because you are running for president. And a lot of the people don't really know, yet, you know, who you are or what you want. And you owe it to them to be there in these kind of situations even if you think it's tough. He didn't answer that.GOLDBERG: Let me just make a quick observation about that. It didn't come off to me so much as a political interview as a spat between two old buddies and a very, very, very public spat. As far as the journalism is concerned. You and I just disagree on this. I don't think it's a good idea for a journalist, even an opinion journalist, giving advice to anybody running for president of the United States. It just causes problems but we disagree and, you know, reasonable people as they say disagree.O'REILLY: Yes. I mean, look, you can look at it as advice giving but I look at it as looking out for the folks. I want the electorate to elect the next time around the best possible candidate. Therefore, I want all the candidates to get as much exposure as possible. As I said in the talking points memo and I believe firmly, people voted for Barack Obama they had no blanking clue who they were voting for, none. And I don't want it to happen again. So, you can say it's advice giving, but I'm saying, I'm looking out for the folks.GOLDBERG: But you don't think that's an unreasonable interpretation. I mean, I know what you are saying but I'm not --O'REILLY: Yes. Do I think it's unreasonable? No. I don't think it's unreasonable. But do I take it seriously?GOLDBERG: You know, Bill, I hope it goes up your nose that --(LAUGHTER)O'REILLY: Good line, Goldberg. Show them what you are drinking. Show them what you are drinking before the interview, right now.GOLDBERG: Red bull.O'REILLY: Look at that, see? He can't just come on as a normal person. He has got to be stoked. All right.GOLDBERG: Hey, listen, without a red bull, I would fall asleep during the segment.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
