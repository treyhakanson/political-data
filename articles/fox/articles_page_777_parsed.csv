This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to ""Hannity."" And tonight, Donald Trump is pounding the campaign trail, ramping up his rhetoric against Hillary Clinton. Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Did you see over the weekend, Fox, Chris Wallace, where she lied, where she said the FBI director said, like, everything was just perfect? It wasn't exactly -- I mean, she lied! She pure and simple -- she only knows to lie!We have people that don't know what they're doing. Hillary Clinton will be worse. She'll be worse. You know, she wants to play the tough one. She's not tough. She's not tough. I know tough people. She's not tough. I mean, she's -- she's just -- she's doing the -- the handlers, they push her from place to place.And she's going to keep ObamaCare. She's going to let people continue to pour into our country, and we have no idea who the hell they are. She's going to let the Syrian refugees come in, and we don't know if they're ISIS. We have no idea. It's going to be the all-time great Trojan horse.  They come in by the thousands.Therefore, I can't imagine that the people of Loudoun (ph) are going to be voting for crooked Hillary Clinton.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: And also tonight, the liberal mainstream media -- they're now hysterical after Donald Trump said Bernie Sanders made a deal with the devil by supporting Hillary Clinton. Here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: He made a bad deal. He should have not made a deal. He would have gone down as done something really important. Once he made that deal -- and believe me, he has buyer's remorse, you know? This guy has buyer's remorse. He looked at that, and he was so angry when they were talking about him, and his people are angry at him, and they should be.If he would have just not done anything, just go home, go to sleep, relax, he would have been a hero. But he made a deal with the devil. She's the devil! He made a deal with the devil.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Here with reaction, former speaker of the House, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich. Mr. Speaker, good to see you.NEWT GINGRICH, R-FMR. HOUSE SPEAKER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to see you.HANNITY: All right, I'm going to play Hillary lying on ""Fox News Sunday"" later. You just can't miss the opportunity. But playing it or not playing it, even a CNN/ORC poll that came out shows that -- Do you think Hillary Clinton is honest and trustworthy? Here are the numbers -- 64 percent say no, 34 percent say yes! I don't know about the one percent that have no opinion.But how do you get elected president and have two thirds of the American people surveyed think you're a liar?GINGRICH: Well, I think what she's got to do is, with Barack Obama's help, is try to shrink Donald Trump so that he becomes smaller. She can't build herself up. She's not going to convince most of that 64 percent that she's honest.So she has to convince them that Trump is more dangerous than she is, that while she is -- you know, somebody said earlier that he's dangerous because you don't know what he's going to do. And you know she's stable because she's a crook and she's a liar, but at least she's a stable crook and liar.And I think that's sort of their -- their whole game plan is to make Trump unacceptable so people reluctantly vote for Hillary.HANNITY: All right. Now, a war of words has broken out between the president, who I would argue in every measure -- we have the lowest home ownership rate in 51 years. We got one in five American families, not a single member in the family working. We now -- he's now accumulated more debt than every other president before him combined, millions more in poverty, millions more on food stamps.But you know, the former community organizer who went to the church of ""G D America"" and hung out with Ayers and Dohrn, he said Trump's unfit to be president. We'll play that and Trump's response.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I think the Republican nominee is unfit to serve as president. I said so last week, and he keeps on proving it. The fact that he doesn't appear to have basic knowledge around critical issues in Europe, in the Middle East, in Asia means that he's woefully unprepared to do this job.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, Trump responded, and he said the following. He said, ""Obama and Clinton have single-handedly destabilized the Middle East, handed Iraq, Libya, Syria to ISIS and allowed our personnel to be slaughtered at Benghazi."" He further goes on to say that then they put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons. Then they allowed dozens of veterans to die waiting for medical care that never, ever came.And he continues, ""Hillary Clinton put the whole country at risk with her illegal e-mail server, deleted evidence of her crime, and lied repeatedly about her conduct, which endangered all of us.""And then he said, ""They have betrayed our security, our workers, and Hillary Clinton has proven herself unfit to serve in any government office.""Is it a case where it seems that now Obama is more invested than ever, desperate almost to engage Trump? And the one thing he seems to like to do is give speeches and get in political fights.GINGRICH: Well, I think that the left, whether it's the news media, the Clinton campaign, or Obama -- the left thinks they have a chance now to define Trump around this whole Khan issue and make him unacceptable.And this is -- in a sense, you think back to Senate races. This is their Todd Akin moment. If they can define him into a box, then he can't get out of the box and he loses the election no matter how bad Hillary is.The problem for the president is -- and I hope that Trump will take him head-on about this -- this is a president, when he talks about not knowing things -- he didn't know that you couldn't keep your doctor, that he was lying. He didn't know that the red lines in Syria were going to disappear.  He didn't know that the Russians were going to take Crimea. He didn't know that Iraq was going to collapse. He still doesn't know that 3,400 Americans have been killed in his hometown of Chicago since he became president.You go down the list of things that Barack Obama doesn't know, and it is astonishing the arrogance and the demagoguery of this man in just sweeping away others.HANNITY: Yes.GINGRICH: I mean, I think the Obama presidency will be looked back upon as one of the great failures in American history.HANNITY: You know, I love your historical background and the context and texture. You run everything through the prism of the knowledge you've accumulated. In your mind, frame this election and what's at stake. I have the way I frame it, but I'm more interested in how you would frame this entire election.GINGRICH: Well, we're going to end up with two really very different choices. We're going to have an establishment figure who bears all of the corruption, all of the inside dealings, all of the baggage of an establishment that's decaying, and we're going to have an outsider who has all of the challenges and the weaknesses of somebody who's truly outside the system but is the only real hope of shaking up and potentially profoundly changing the current system.Now, that's about as big a choice -- this goes back to Andrew Jackson probably in 1828. In some ways, it goes back to Lincoln versus the old order in 1860, maybe FDR versus Herbert Hoover in 1932. I mean this is a huge -- this is a bigger choice than Reagan versus Carter in 1980.HANNITY: You know, I give the list. I mean, look how profoundly different they are on the issue of Supreme Court justices. Look how profoundly different they are. One wants amnesty and no immigration laws for the most part whatsoever, and one's going to build a wall. One is going to increase refugees 550 percent, and one is going to make sure we can vet them properly so what happened in Belgium and France, Germany and Europe, doesn't happen here.School choice -- send it back to the states. ""Obama care,"" eliminate, health care savings accounts. Radical Islam, even acknowledging it, for crying out loud. There's such a profound difference.I just wonder, you know, where the public is on this. In other words, I heard a lot of cliches and platitudes at the Democratic convention and I heard a lot of reality at the Republican convention.GINGRICH: Well, look, I think what you've got right now -- and you saw a bounce for Trump after his convention, then washed away by a bounce for Hillary after her convention.What you have is an enormous news media bias. Think of it as a headwind against a sailing ship. They're going to do everything they can to stop Trump. They're going to do everything they can to exaggerate every mistake he makes, and they're going to interpret everything in the worst possible light.And they're doing that both to prop up Hillary and to try to slow down Trump because they began to realize this spring this guy could really win.  And if he wins, he really will change their world. It will be very different...HANNITY: Democrats privately...GINGRICH: ... than it has been for the last half century.HANNITY: ... have told me that there's a lot of sweating going on in Democratic ranks. They too believe that Trump could win.I would argue that this whole issue of Mr. Khan is one of those examples where the media takes a side because we could see the coverage the week before the Republican convention, and Pat Smith, she got 70 seconds. The networks gave the whole Khan story nearly an hour's worth of coverage.You know, you can't give that away. You can't buy that amount of coverage.  And similarly, the families and mothers that spoke about their children killed by illegal immigrants because we don't fix our broken system -- they were ignored by the media.This Khan issue -- Donald Trump said, number one, this kid was a hero. He said that he had no issue with the father. He said he was not talking about the Khans when he was talking about vetting refugees. How did it blow up into this?GINGRICH: Well, I think one of the lessons Ronald Reagan learned was you cannot give the elite media an inch or they will exploit it, and they'll reinterpret it in the worst possible light. And Reagan over time became very careful by focusing -- he came back and focused on Jimmy Carter. He came back and focused on the big issues.And Trump is going to have to learn that every time he gives the media a chance, they're going to hit him, and they're going to keep hitting him.HANNITY: Is the answer...GINGRICH: So he needs to go back...HANNITY: I didn't mean to interrupt. Is the answer focus on jobs, economy, immigration, refugees, and issues and protecting the homeland only? Is that the answer?GINGRICH: Well, the answer is, one, to stay with issues. And two, you know, it's OK for him to fight with Obama or with Hillary because they're the same level.HANNITY: Got it.GINGRICH: Don't fight with people other than Obama and Hillary. But I hope he's going to be very tough with Obama because what Obama said today in the White House, standing next to a foreign leader, I thought was pretty despicable for a president of the United States to be that harsh about his potential successor.HANNITY: Well said.GINGRICH: I mean, talk about undermining the United States of America.  Barack Obama potentially did that today.HANNITY: Powerful statement.We'll continue. We'll have more with Newt Gingrich right after this break.And also coming up...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I'm telling you, November 8th, we better because careful because that election's going to be rigged, and I hope the Republicans are watching closely, or it's going to be taken away from us.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump last night right here on this program said that he thinks the Democrats will rig the election in November. I have some evidence he could be right. I'll explain.And also tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUDY GIULIANI, R- FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: My advice to Donald would be very simple. I'll tell you the advice I'd give him. You have one person to attack, Hillary Clinton.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Rudy Giuliani with some advice for the GOP nominee. We have more reaction from Newt Gingrich. Also, Laura Ingraham will be here tonight.  That and more as we continue.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I'm telling you, November 8th, we better be careful because that election's going to be rigged. And I hope the Republicans are going to be watching closely, or it's going to be taken away from us.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, Donald Trump right here on this program talking about how he believes that it's possible the election in November could be rigged for Hillary Clinton.And earlier today on ""Fox & Friends,"" former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani -- he shared some advice for Mr. Trump. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GIULIANI: My advice to Donald would be very simple. I'll tell you the advice I'd give him. You have one person to attack, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama because it's the Obama administration. Let all of us -- myself, Gingrich, Christie, his whole army -- let us attack everybody else. That's always been my rule in politics, which is you're running against one person. Don't run against the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: And we continue with former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.Let's go back to the earlier issue of Trump saying we've got to be careful, that it's rigged. Now, we did learn that the DNC rigged the system with superdelegates and the DNC was fully behind Hillary Clinton the entire way, and the e-mails proved that. Here's an interesting statistic. The Philly Inquirer one week after the 2012 election pointed out that in 59 separate precincts in inner city Philadelphia, that Mitt Romney did not get a single vote, not one! And according to The Cleveland Plain dealer, there were nine precincts in Cleveland alone, again, not a single Romney vote, not one!Now, maybe I'm conspiratorial. Maybe this is a stretch. But 70 districts in two cities, 70-plus districts, not a single vote for Romney? Is that possible?GINGRICH: Sure. Look, my first real presidential election in terms of being involved and paying attention was 1960 between Nixon and Kennedy.  And I don't think any historian doubts that the Democrats stole Illinois and they stole Texas, and that was the margin of the election, just straight-out theft. People in Chicago who had been dead for a long time managed to still miraculously vote. People in parts of Texas where Lyndon Johnson could deliver them voted even if they no longer existed.I think there's a long tradition on the part of Democratic machines of trying to steal elections, and that's why what really matters is for Republicans to recognize that and organize enough Republican attorneys and Republican poll watchers to offset it. I mean, you have to assume the other side -- and this goes back to everything that Trump has been saying about Hillary. I mean, if you assume that she's a crook, as he says, if you assume that she lies, as he says, why would you expect her to have an honest election?But the job, then, is for the Republicans to recruit enough poll watchers and to recruit enough attorneys that you can go nose to nose with them everywhere in the country and not allow that to happen.HANNITY: You know, you have pointed out many times on this program that Trump represents a clear and present danger to modern-day Washington, to the establishment, to the infrastructure, if you will, the incestuous relationship between lobbyists and congressmen and their staffs and the media.And I agree with you. I think you're dead-on right. I've watched, for example, Paul Ryan, Lindsey Graham, even Jeb Bush, who won't endorse Trump, and John McCain. All these people are out there, and they seem more critical of Donald Trump than they've ever been willing to speak out against Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton.Now Donald Trump has said he's not supporting either McCain or Paul Ryan in their primaries. I think they've earned that distinction from him. What are your thoughts on it?GINGRICH: Well, look, I think that Trump's got to figure out sooner or later, as Rudy Giuliani was saying a while ago, how many fights does he want to get into. Paul Ryan is the speaker of the House. He's a very smart, hard-working guy. John McCain...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: He said he's not quite there yet. So it sounds like might.GINGRICH: Yes. I'm just saying I think Trump's either got to be the leader of the party, and shame on those who don't endorse him, or he's got to be a random guy who goes around picking a lot of fights he doesn't need.John McCain has a long record of serving this country in the military, as a POW, in the House and in the Senate. He is a superb chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and he deserves the support of every rational Republican in the country.And Paul Ryan is -- Paul Ryan right now is the heart of the House Republican Party. He has very high approval among Republicans across the whole country, and these are -- you know, I agree totally with Rudy Giuliani. You've got one person to beat. It's Hillary Clinton. You beat Hillary Clinton, you're president. You beat 23 other people and lose to Hillary Clinton, you're not going to be president.HANNITY: Let me ask you -- yes.GINGRICH: So focus on the main fight.HANNITY: Yes. Not bad advice at all. All right, we have a debate commission. One of the co-chairs is a guy by the name of Mike McCurry.  For those...(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: What did I do to make you laugh so hard? What did I do?GINGRICH: You have brought out my favorite current topic.HANNITY: Yes, I know that because I've been talking to you recently. All right, so Mike McCurry, former press secretary for Bill Clinton. So of the three presidential debates, one is up against Sunday Night Football, and the other is up against Monday Night Football. And I'm thinking, OK, that's pretty stupid. Let's see. What am I going to watch, football or Hillary? Probably Hillary versus Trump, but you know, I'm not the -- I love football, but that's a dumb decision.Why did they do this, and what can be done to stop it?GINGRICH: Well, everybody should contact the debate commission and tell them move the two debates. I mean, the fact is -- and I have a personal interest in this because the Falcons are the Sunday night game, and Green Bay is the Monday night game, and I have an interest in both those teams.  So I would like them, you know, to move the debate.But here's the thing that's crazy. We have had Monday night football since 1970. We've had Sunday night football since 1987. The notion that this elite hidden-away group of Washingtonians couldn't figure out those two dates are dumb dates...HANNITY: But doesn't it sound like what Hillary did to Bernie Sanders?  They tried to bury these debates on, like, a Saturday night when everybody's out of town and nobody's watching them? It seems like a strategy to me...(CROSSTALK)GINGRICH: Look, I don't think -- look, it's a bipartisan commission, folks who've been around a long time and who are self-appointed, and they think of themselves as the debate Gods. And I think they made this decision 15 months ago.HANNITY: Yes.GINGRICH: But let's just start out with a simple notion. This is early August. The debates are late September and October. They can change it.  It ain't that big a deal.HANNITY: Good point.GINGRICH: The American people -- one poll I saw, 86 percent of the country wants them to move the debates.HANNITY: Move them.GINGRICH: That's what a populist rebellion is like.HANNITY: Mr. Speaker, good to see you. Thank you.And coming up next tonight right here on ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Here's a woman who is a total thief! I mean, she's a crook! She's a crook, and she lies more than any human being I've ever seen!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump unloading on Hillary Clinton for flat-out lying about her private e-mail server scandal. We'll check in with Laura Ingraham with reaction.That, and also later tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ERIC TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S SON: I think this is something that was honestly blown hugely out of proportion because he first of all said the Khan family looked like amazing people in that interview, which for whatever reason, never wants to get reported.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump's son, Eric Trump -- he slams the liberal media for its biased coverage of Khizr Khan and that story. We'll expose the double standard. It'll shock you.That and more tonight on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Here's a woman who's a total thief! I mean, she's a crook! She's a crook, and she lies more than any human being I've ever seen! And she's got no gravitas. And by the way, she's got a bad temperament! She's got a temperament of a loser!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, that was Donald Trump going after Hillary Clinton earlier today on the campaign trail, calling her a thief and a crook.Joining us now with reaction, editor of Lifezette.com and Fox News contributor Laura Ingraham, also a nationally syndicated radio host.You know, what's amazing to me is all the evidence we have -- and even a CNN poll -- 64 percent in that poll think she's dishonest, untrustworthy, and still it's sort of like if we had Hillary on video shooting somebody, you still would get that 45 percent of Americans voting for her saying, Well, the guy probably deserved it, or he had enough money, we'll give it to the poor.LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, there was an interesting piece today in The Wall Street Journal about why Trump has been successful despite the fact that he has, you know, Hollywood and the establishment in both parties pretty much against him, and academia and all these other people, and media -- because he's always on the offensive, and he's on the offensive against Hillary.Like, they call out Trump today. Obama does this big, Oh, he's unfit for office, and so forth, and Trump keeps staying on the offensive. He has to keep doing that. He shouldn't get sidetracked with all this, you know, side criticism and all the side issues like the Khans. He should focus right on what is happening to the American people today.And the service of our soldiers should be extolled and elevated always, but he has to focus on the American economy and a strong, forward-looking foreign policy.HANNITY: You know...INGRAHAM: He does that, he's going to win this election. If he gets sidetracked, he's not.HANNITY: 97 days to go. I agree with you. I think that if he stays focused on jobs, the economy and protecting the homeland, stay away from all this other stuff -- and by the way, there are surrogates that want him to win. I want him to win. You want him to win. I don't want Hillary to be president.But let me give a visual example of the FBI director -- first, we'll play Hillary from ""FOX News Sunday"" totally mischaracterizing what James Comey, the FBI director, said before Trey Gowdy and his committee. And he just says, lie, lie, lie, and still people are supporting her. Let's play them back-to-back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS WALLACE, HOST, ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY"": FBI director James Comey said none of those things that you told the American public were true.HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Chris, that's not what I heard Director Comey say. Director Comey said that my answers were truthful, and what I've said is consistent with what I have told the American people.REP. TREY GOWDY, R-S.C.: Secretary Clinton said there was nothing marked classified on her e-mails either sent or received. Was that true?JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR: That's not true. There were a small number of portion markings on I think three of the documents.GOWDY: Secretary Clinton said, I did not e-mail any classified material to anyone on my e-mail. There is no classified material. Was that true?COMEY: No, there was classified material e-mailed.GOWDY: Secretary Clinton said all work-related e-mails were returned to the State Department. Was that true?COMEY: No. We found work-related e-mails, thousands, that were not returned.GOWDY: Secretary Clinton said her lawyers read every one of the e-mails and were overly inclusive. Did her lawyers read the e-mail content individually?COMEY: No.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Five separate lies, Laura!INGRAHAM: Yes. I mean -- and that's only -- that's only scraping the surface of Hillary's lies about the e-mail server, of course, the sitting by while the lie about Benghazi was told, lying to the Benghazi mother who I guess the media doesn't consider a legitimate victim of this current environment because I guess she doesn't like Hillary. So she's not a legitimate victim.But Hillary -- this is just the way the Clintons do business, Sean. You and I have been talking about the Clintons since the mid-1990s. But we know what they do. So for all of these people -- Oh, Trump, you know, mischaracterizes his relationship with Putin -- you know, I'll grant you Trump has to be a lot more careful with his language. But he was not secretary of state selling out our national security for her, quote, ""convenience"" with her private server!So, you know, all of this stuff, you have to look at it in context, and also look at the severity and the context, the purpose of the mischaracterization, the misstatement, or the downright lie.HANNITY: I've always said that the number one contributor to Hillary's campaign is going to be the mainstream media. Now we have some evidence.  Pat Smith, she spoke at the Republican National Convention and MRC did a study. In 14 days after a speech, the networks gave her a whopping 70 seconds. Since this guy, Mr. Khan spoke, well he got 55 minutes and 13 seconds. What a disparity. That's a campaign contribution.INGRAHAM: Absolutely, Sean. When you really think about it, who believes that Hillary or Obama are really up at night losing a lot of sleep over our Gold Star families? I think they're losing sleep over one thing, and it's the possibility that Donald Trump is going to expose all of them for what they really are -- corrupt to the core, globalists at heart, and post- American. And that's what really has them nervous.So the big pig pile by the billionaires and they're meeting in Colorado at the Koch brothers conference and they're all laughing at Trump, which means they're laughing at the voters, too. And I think that's what really has these people agitated. So every little comment of Trump, the baby's crying, he's against babies. He's against Muslims. The whole thing is patently ridiculous. The country is going down the tubes. They know they've presided over the decline. They have no defense over the substantive arguments of immigration, trade, refugee policy.HANNITY: It's got to be jobs, the economy, and protecting the homeland.INGRAHAM: Absolutely.HANNITY: Let me ask you this. So we have more resignations over at the DNC. Now, these e-mails revealed a lot -- racial slurs, gay slurs, misogynistic language, and an entire anti-Semitic strategy for Democratic voters in Kentucky and West Virginia. You and I both know if Trump did this --INGRAHAM: Forget it.HANNITY: -- or the RNC did it, it would never end. How does Hillary not only skate on this, but then she hires Wasserman Schultz?INGRAHAM: Exactly. And how is the Anti-Defamation League, which can do some really great work -- I think if Trump were doing something like this, they would be at the front door of the Trump Tower. They'd be demanding resignations, media exposes, further dissociation from the Trump campaign.  But in this media climate when they all are cheering for Hillary, Trump has got to get used to this, Sean. Other than your show and a few others, this is not going to really be covered. This is going to be swept under the rug. They'll get some glancing coverage, but it will not be the sustained drumbeat that they give to issues such as the Khan family or the Russia running the Trump campaign. It's so transparent to most people. I really think in the end people see through most of this stuff. I really do.HANNITY: All right, Laura, always good to see you. Thank you.INGRAHAM: Good to see you, Sean.HANNITY: Coming up next tonight right here on ""Hannity.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ERIC TRUMP: I think this is something that was honestly blown hugely out of proportion because he, first of all, said the Khan family looked like amazing people in that interview, which for whatever reason never wants to get reported.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Donald Trump's son Eric, he's calling out the liberal mainstream media for its obsession with the Khizr Khan story.And later, Chicago is now seeing a massive surge in violence, but liberals and the Black Lives Matter movement, they're completely silent all of a sudden after July represents a 10-year high in violence in Chicago. We have the numbers. Sheriff David Clarke, Geraldo react. That and more tonight right here on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ERIC TRUMP: I think this is something that was honestly blown hugely out of proportion, because he, first of all, said the Khan family looked like amazing people in that interview, which for whatever reason never wants to get reported. He called him a hero at so many different times. And again, he's not -- he wasn't talking -- this isn't a Muslim thing. This is an ISIS thing. And this is also an anti-immigration, anti-Syrian refugee thing coming into the country because he doesn't want to see more Americans dead. My father is a great patriot. He doesn't want to see more Americans dead.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Eric Trump earlier today saying that the feud between his father and the Khan family has been blown completely out of proportion by the liberal media. Joining us now with reaction, Fox News contributor Rick Grenell, and conservative columnist and Trump surrogate A.J. Delgado.  A.J., this is very frustrating to me. He called the son a hero. He was against that war. Hillary was for it. He said once you go to fight the war, you got to finish it, and we know what happened by pulling out early.When you compare Pat Smith's coverage to Khan's coverage, the disparity is nearly an hour to 70 seconds by the mainstream media. So my question is, why are they distorting this, and what does it mean?A.J. DELGADO, CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST: Eric is absolutely right. I think what we're seeing here is the media is not even pretending anymore that they're not in Hillary's camp. Let's see what happened here. We had headlines saying that Donald Trump had attacked Mr. Khan. And the truth is not only did Donald Trump not attack Mr. Khan, he praised him. He said this was a nice man who seems like a nice man.The attacking came from Mr. Khan, who viciously, heinously, for no reason said -- and I quote -- that Donald Trump had sacrificed nothing.  Not only was that an unnecessary, ugly, toxic insult in what could have been a beautiful speech about his son's heroism, but Mr. Khan insulted most Americans when he said that because he was saying someone who is a parent like Mr. Trump, who's had five children, raised five wonderful children, can do that without any sacrifice. What about school teachers? What about firefighters? All of these people sacrifice daily for this nation, and he's saying essentially that unless you've lost a child in war, you have sacrificed nothing. It was really a shameful speech.HANNITY: Rick, our national director of intelligence James Clapper, our FBI director Comey, our CIA director Brennan, our assistant FBI director Steinbeck, our former special envoy to defeat ISIS General John Allen, and, one more, our House Homeland Security Committee Chair McCaul all said, like Belgium, like Germany, like Paris, like Europe in general, that ISIS and radical Islamists will infiltrate the refugee population. That's where his policy is coming from. Until we can vet them and make sure Americans are safe. He wasn't talking about the Khan family. He wasn't talking in any pejorative way about anybody. He's talking about keeping Americans safe.  Why does the media take it to that level?RICHARD GRENELL, FORMER SPOKESMAN FOR U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: These are a bunch of young reporters who are really easily manipulated. And when you look at these reporters who are just re-tweeting and repeating and reposting stuff on Facebook, no one is really taking the time to look at the evidence. They're looking at their colleagues. They're looking at their Twitter followers, and they're just repeating this line. It's a groupthink. And it's a very young reporter thing to do.HANNITY: But it's not just groupthink. It's also CNN and NBC and ABC and CBS. The disproportionate coverage, especially when you compare it to Pat Smith, it's daunting.GRENELL: Yes, it is daunting. Look, we're on the fifth day of this or sixth day, talking about Trump's comments. ""The New York Times"" puts on their front page above the fold how other politicians are reacting to the Donald Trump statement.Meanwhile, what's happening today is the U.S. is bombing is and Libya because Hillary Clinton's failed judgment has brought us to the place where ISIS is growing into another country. I mean, why aren't reporters focusing on what's truly happening today, things that matter, rather than the six-day coverage of the Khan story?HANNITY: And as we just pointed out in the last segment, A.J., and Hillary lying on ""FOX News Sunday"" easily provable in her characterization of James Comey.DELGADO: Right, and this is why this all comes together. We're going to see a fake controversy against Mr. Trump almost daily. Why? Because the media wants to keep the American public focused and distracted on the fact that Hillary Clinton hasn't had a press conference in over 200 days. They want to keep us distracted away from the fact that the Clinton Foundation was basically a pay-for-play organization, and all of these other issues.  So if they can keep manufacturing these fake controversies, they figure the American public won't pay attention to what Hillary Clinton's record is or what she's doing. But we're smarter than that, and we will.HANNITY: Thank you both for being with us. Appreciate it. Great points.Coming up, last month -- get this. Last month 65 people were killed in Chicago. That makes it the deadliest July in Chicago in the past decade.  By the way, do you know any of the names? Why isn't the president, why isn't Hillary talking about it? Where's Black Lives Matter? Are they talking about it? Are they trying to stop this out of control violence?  Sheriff David Clarke, Geraldo Rivera are next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" Now, according to the Chicago police department, last month was the deadliest July in a decade for the residents of the windy city. Now, tragically, 65 people were killed. The city was rocked by over 360 shooting incidents, which led to a staggering 441 victims.So where is Black Lives Matter? Where is the protesting about this violence? What about Secretary Clinton? Where's Barack Obama? Is anyone going to meet with leaders in Chicago and find a solution to all this turmoil? Joining us now, Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, Fox News senior correspondent Geraldo Rivera.Sheriff, before this, over 3,470 people that live in Chicago were killed since Obama was president. OK, so now it's over 3,500. My question to you is really simple. I bet you most Americans don't know the names of one of them. Why does he only weigh in on Freddie Grays, the Michael Browns, the Trayvon Martins, the Cambridge police, and never talk about his own home city where thousands have been killed, thousands more shot? Why?SHERIFF DAVID CLARKE, MILWAUKEE COUNTY: Because this is a political construct, you know that. This Black Lives Matter, a hateful, destructive ideology. It's never been about black life. Look at these new demands that were put out, this manifesto. It reminds me of a nine-year-old kid who sits on the floor and tells his mom he's going to hold his breath until he gets to watch cartoons.Listen to some of the things, just a few of the things they're asking for.  They want climate change addressed. They want an end to deportation of illegal immigrants. They also want reparations for slavery and they want an end to capitalism.This has George Soros written all over it. This, like I said, has always been a political construct to drive up black votes. Blacks have been thrown overboard by this movement and I think it's a shame. They can't look to Chicago and they can't look to all of this black on black crime because they would have to look in the mirror, Sean, and say, you know what, our policies have caused the destruction of the black community, and then they'd have to take responsibility for it. So instead they mask it over with this phony idea that black lives matter to them.HANNITY: And I know, you and I have been friends many years now. And I know how important race issues are to you. Immigration, you and I have battled on immigration and illegal immigration. This isn't a game. When you're talking about 3,500 people dead, we don't know any of those names.  Can you name one person?GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: No. And I think broadly this is the dirty little secret in the Black Lives Matter movement, and it is the reason there is so much friction between me and various activists when I confront them out on the street as I did in Philadelphia. Black lives only matter to these activists when a blue life takes the black life.  It's when black falls to blue. And black is on black, there is zero interest, and that is by far the most profound issue confronting urban America today is the violence perpetrated by young black men and brown men against other young black men and young brown men.The statistics you cite in Chicago, while alarming, pale when compared to St. Louis, Detroit, New Orleans, Baltimore, Newark, and so forth. There is an utter failure of urban society. It is a structural, profound problem.HANNITY: Unless it's a high profile case, as you point out, where a narrative is cops against black or brown people, the president is absent, missing in action. So to me that says, and tell me if I'm out of line here, he's not really caring about lives. He's caring about politics.  He's caring about a political narrative that advances or maybe gins up support for his party. If he cared about lives, his ass would be in Chicago and he'd be trying to quell the violence after the deadliest month.RIVERA: I don't disagree with anything you've said. Look at the cities I've named. What do they have in common? All of them are run by traditional Democratic machine politics, the politics of entitlement. But you have cited districts in the 2012 election where not a single, nary a vote was cast for Mitt Romney or before him, John McCain. Why is that? Of course, the Democrats are here, I'm giving you this, I'm giving you that.  Why don't the Republicans offer an alternative? If I were running for anything on a national -- if I was running the RNC, what I'd be saying is follow the Republican way. For example, charter schools, why don't we push charter schools? Why don't we push a jobs program? Why don't we push and an anti-gang law enforcement initiative to stop all this --HANNITY: And also put the cameras on the cops, which you and I agree on.  All right, sheriff, we'll give you the last word tonight.CLARKE: Look. Here is what is important to the black community. And I'm there all the time. They want safer neighborhoods. They want better schools from their kids. They want their kids unshackled from these failing public schools. And they want meaningful work. They need jobs.  Donald Trump has offered that. He's the law and order candidate. He is for school choice, the voucher programs. And he's made it clear he's going to bring jobs, meaningful jobs back to the United States. The only way out of this situation for black America is to stop voting en masse for the Democrats and give the other party a chance.HANNITY: All right, guys, good to see you, good ideas from everybody.All right, when we come back, a very, very important question about whether or not there is integrity in the American electoral system. We need your help. That is next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: All right, time for our ""Question of the Day."" So in light of Donald Trump's comments last night, do you think the general election could be rigged? Remember, in Philly, 59 separate districts, not one vote for Mitt Romney in 2012. Nine districts just in Cleveland, not one vote for Mitt Romney. Mathematically, it's impossible.Anyway, we want your thoughts. Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you think.Unfortunately, that is all the time we have left for this evening. As always, thank you for being with us. We'll see you back here tomorrow night.  Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

7	7	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/10/21/bill-oreilly-kate-law-donald-trump-and-ben-carson/	Bill O'Reilly: Kate's Law, Donald Trump and Ben Carson	"As we predicted here on The Factor, Democrats in the Senate blocked a vote on Kate's Law today. That is the bill that would impose a mandatory five-year prison sentence on any illegal immigrant convicted of an aggravated felony who is deported and then returns after being deported. Five years mandatory.The reason the Democrats blocked Kate's Law is that it was attached to defunding sanctuary cities which the left does not want to do. Foolishly, instead of simply voting straight up on Kate's Law, the senate put both pieces of legislation together.Everybody knew that would doom the vote. Everybody knew it. Yet the Republican leadership did it anyway. That's what makes Americans furious with the political system in Washington.On Gretchen Carlson's program today Senator Rand Paul actually tried to justify the situation which is just another reason Paul will never be president of the United States. The truth is politicians are playing games with our safety.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV), MINORITY LEADER: Democrats believe (inaudible) and local law enforcement are better judges on what keep their communities safe than Donald Trump or Bill O'Reilly. The safety of our neighborhoods and local communities should not be a pawn for a Republican latest gambit tied to their failure to act on comprehensive immigration reform.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Senator Reid, the poster boy for anarchy, could not care less about the death of Kate Steinle -- could not care less. All he cares about is complete amnesty for undocumented immigrants. That's it.Now, this is why Donald Trump and Ben Carson continue to lead in the Republican polling. Recent CNN poll has it this way: Trump 27, Carson 22, Marco Rubio 8, Jeb Bush 8; everyone else 5 percent or below. NBC/Wall Street Journal: Trump 25 percent, Carson 22 percent, Rubio 13 percent, Ted Cruz 9 percent, Bush 8 percent, Carly Fiorina 7 percent; everybody else below 5 percent.It's obvious many Americans are fed up with politics as usual and want to crush the current system. Both Trump and Carson support Kate's Law and would not play games with it.There comes a point where the American people are going to have to take back their government when a 32-year-old woman can be gunned down by an illegal felon who had been deported five times, and you can't get a strict law punishing illegal alien felons passed? When that happens, you don't have a functioning government.It's hard to believe but the far left in America actively opposes Kate's Law. Recent editorial in the New York Times actually sympathize with the man charged with killing Kate, quote, ""Mr. Lopez Sanchez was a homeless man with drug convictions but no record of violent crime. The bullet he fired was found to have ricocheted off the pier, suggesting that he had not targeted anyone. The suggestion that it was a horrific accident could well be true,"" unquote.Well, here's the truth. Juan Lopez Sanchez Was convicted of seven felonies in the U.S.A. including selling hard drugs. He was deported five times. He came back six times. He broke into a car in San Francisco. He stole a gun. He recklessly fired that gun in a public place. And Kate Steinle died. Yet, he is portrayed as a homeless man who just might have committed an accident.It's unbelievable -- unbelievable is too gentle a word.Finally, I'm not going to give up. Senator Charles Grassley, a hero on Kate's Law, is trying to get a stand alone vote.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R), IOWA: Thanks to many people, including TV's Bill O'Reilly, for keeping this issue constantly before the people of this country. This part of the bill then named by Bill O'Reilly commonly referred to as Kate's Law has become so important to many Americans.(END VIDEO CLIP)O'REILLY: Well, we will see if Grassley's quest will finally lead to justice in the United States Senate. But, if it does not, hear me well, we will confront the villains no matter which party harbors them.And that's ""The Memo"".Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years. He joined the network in 1996 and is based in New York. Click here for more information on Bill O'Reilly. "	['Sanchez', 'Trump', 'Rubio', 'Carson', 'Cruz', 'Paul']	[]
