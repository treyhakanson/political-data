This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: Continuing now with our lead story: an exclusive interview with the parents of Kate Steinle who was murdered in San Francisco by criminal illegal alien. So far about 400,000 of you have signed a petition posted on BillOReilly.com that we will deliver to the Senate and the House asking for Congress to pass Kate's law.That proposed law would mandate, mandate that any illegal alien convicted of a felony in the U.S.A. who comes back to this country after being deported would serve a mandatory five years in federal prison upon apprehension. Second offense 10 years. The key word is ""mandatory"" -- no wiggle room. The debate over whether non-felons who defy deportation should be part of the bill's procedure is underway but the vital part is keeping the felons off the streets of America. We are hoping to get one million Americans to sign a petition on BillOReilly.com which, again, we will deliver to Speaker Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.Re-joining us now from Pleasanton, California Kate's parents, Liz Sullivan and Jim Steinle.So I'm talking to you over the weekend, Mr. Steinle and you indicate you do support Kate's law. Why?JIM STEINLE: Well, I support Kate's law because it would be a legacy in her name and her death would not go unnoticed. For an apolitical family we keep up with politics because we're citizens of the United States. And, you know, we feel the federal, state, and cities -- their laws are here to protect us but we feel that this particular set of circumstances and the people involved, the different agencies let us down.We are just a little tired of the finger pointing and just want to see some action and if Kate's law saves one person, then it is all for good.O'REILLY: And that's very well said, Mr. Steinle.Ms. Sullivan, that's exactly what I was trying to do. If it saves one American -- one American family that does not have to go through Ms. Sullivan what you are going through right now, then Kate's law is worth it. It should be done. It's only fair. And our laws are supposed to protect us not only from foreign felons but from domestic felons.We can do this -- I think it will happen. That is one of the reasons we wanted you to come on tonight. Do you have any thoughts about it, Ms. Sullivan?LIZ SULLIVAN: You just want it to be a good, solid law that won't have holes in it. And I'm sure there will be a lot of posturing back and forth. I had no idea how many people have been killed by illegal aliens. And we've had quite a few people reach out to us and we had no idea it was an issue but something definitely needs to be done.O'REILLY: Yes. The number is in the thousands.JIM STEINLE: Bill, if I may add --O'REILLY: Sure, Mr. Steinle, go ahead.JIM STEINLE: If I may add, the family wants to be involved in the language of the law so we have a sense of Kate within the law. That's very important to us.O'REILLY: Well, I think what we would like to do is bring you both to Washington to talk to the congressmen and the senators who are putting the law together. They go on vacation in August. I think when they come back we will get you both to Washington to talk to them face to face. Maybe to testify in front of some committees there so you can have input and we will report every step of the way.I think you are absolutely right that this law is named after your daughter and you should have input into it. So we are going to make that happen for you. It will be at our expense and we will fly you into Washington and we'll set up the meetings for you. Would that be ok for you guys to do?LIZ SULLIVAN: That would be wonderful.JIM STEINLE: That would be fantastic.O'REILLY: Yes. Because we will make that happen.LIZ SULLIVAN: Kate would be proud. Kate would be proud.O'REILLY: Well, we are doing it for her. We are doing it for you and we're doing it for all Americans.LIZ SULLIVAN: Absolutely.O'REILLY: I have researched your daughter. You know, I'm thinking if my daughter were shot dead, I mean I don't know how you guys can even sit for this interview. I don't think I could do it. I think you have so much courage.And I think that courage and I think your perspective has to be heard in Washington. You know, I will go so far as to say that I would like to get the President of the United States to talk to you as well. We will work on all of that. We will do it in early September when they come back rested from their vacation.In the meantime we want everybody to go to your Web site. And I know millions of people will. I know they will because Americans are a good people and we are concerned on a very, very intimate basis with crime victims and families that are suffering the way you are.So I'm going to each give you a last statement. Ms. Sullivan, you go first.LIZ SULLIVAN: Well, you know, it's just a horrific situation and we find that it has touched so many other people and you just wanted to pay forward. You want to pay it forward and you want to make it so much better for everybody in the United States that this as you say would never happen again.O'REILLY: Mr. Steinle?LIZ SULLIVAN: That's our hope.JIM STEINLE: Well, it just -- again, our faith has kept us strong and the people have kept us strong. But Kate's bright light, you know, the battle of evil and goodness, what happened to Kate was evil personified but her bright light that has shone all over the world, has helped us and this show us and the people of the world, the United States and everywhere with this law that goodness trumps evil any time. And she was a kind person and we're hoping to just keep her legacy alive.O'REILLY: Well, thank you both. I can't tell you how much it means to the country. I would like to say from me and from the vast majority of Factor viewers that our prayers are with you and your family.Thanks again. We will be in touch.LIZ SULLIVAN: Thank you.JIM STEINLE: Thank you.O'REILLY: We will continue this. We're not going to let this go.  Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.PAUL GIGOT, HOST: This week on the ""Journal Editorial Report,"" a look back at the biggest stories of 2015. Spreading global disorder as ISIS makes gains in Iraq and Syria, and Russia steps in to fill the leadership void. Plus, a growing split within the Republican Party claims the House speaker and fuels the rise of a political outsider. All that, and a look at the rising turmoil in America's cities and on college campuses across the country.But first, these headlines.(FOX NEWS REPORT)GIGOT: Welcome to this special edition of the ""Journal Editorial Report"" as we look back at the biggest stories of 2015.We begin with the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and the resulting global disorder as refugees pour across European borders and Russia moves to fill the leadership void in the Middle East.Let's bring in Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; columnist, Bret Stephens; Mary Anastasia O'Grady; and Jason Riley.So, Bret, start with you.You wrote a book predicting the rise of global disorder and we appear to be right on time with all of the chaos emanating from Syria, in particular, but also North Africa, elsewhere. What's happened?BRET STEPHENS, FOREIGN AFFAIRS COLUMNIST: I think the policy choices that President Obama made in his first term and the early years of the second term were -- sort of came to fruition in 2015. We saw the retreat of American power, not only our retreats from Iraq, the draw down in Afghanistan, but clearly the willingness that the -- advertising the fact that we were not going to intervene in places like Syria or we weren't going try to address the spreading chaos in Libya. And the result is people sensed -- the rogues of the world sensed there is an open door they could walk through without consequence. That's what they're doing.GIGOT: Mary, the president's strategy against the Islamic State has been in place for 16 months now. I think he would argue, he has argued, they made a lot of progress. Do you agree?MARY ANASTASIA O'GRADY, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: Well, I think Bret has it right in that the president doesn't build confidence from the American people and this is fundamentally the problem. So he starts out by saying I'm going to get out of Iraq. He gets out of Iraq. He -- first, he says it's been a success. He gets out. Then he blames George Bush that he got out. And now he says we're going back in. And that kind of -- that doesn't gender any confidence.GIGOT: But we're back in but certainly not full like George W. Bush.O'GRADY: The American people don't believe.GIGOT: We have some special operators on the ground. He gradually increased that number and we're doing a bombing campaign. He would say, Jason, we're making progress.JASON RILEY, COLUMNIST: It's not just that there have been setbacks. You expect setbacks in a war against an enemy as dispersed as global terrorism is. It's his denial that there have been these setbacks. His insistence that ISIS is contained, that we are making progress. People see Paris.  They see San Bernardino. And they go, wait a minute, they feel insecure.  Recently, he said in an interview that his only real problem, the only legitimate criticism is his messaging in terms of what the strategy is.(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: That's what every president says.RILEY: We're making progress but it's not a messaging problem. It's a fact that people believe what they see with their own eyes. They see ISIS on ascendant. They see ISIS recruiting people more and more. And they don't see a strategy out there to defeat the enemy.STEPHENS: The president had a narrative. The narrative was the tide of war is receding. Al Qaeda is on a path to defeat. We have turned the page on a decade of war. And it turned out -- these are things he said in his second inaugural address, and it turns out that isn't the world we're actually living in. So it's this disconnect from what the president is telling himself, what his advisors are telling him, and the world we're watching unfold.GIGOT: But in terms of this year, Dan, this -- what Bret describes, I think we made a turn from that politically, at least here from home. I think the American public has changed. The instinct for isolationism on the right has -- I think the rise of Islamic State has killed Rand Paul's presidential campaign, for example, as the American public now puts national security center stage.DAN HENNINGER COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Well, there was a feeling for the longest time, Paul, that the ISIS, Islamic State, was all taking place over there in the Middle East. I think the events of this year changed all that. I mean, first there was the massacre in Paris, this extraordinary event, people driving through the streets of Paris gunning down individuals eating dinner in restaurants, then San Bernardino where it was brought home. This made it clear to the American people that Islamic State is projecting power outside of the Middle East. And it was going to take a much larger, more concentrated effort to contain them, that simply bombing them in Syria was not going to be sufficient. And that, I think, is the kind of leadership that American people are looking for now.GIGOT: Mary, the president I think would also say, look, I actually had a pretty good year in foreign policy. I struck the Iran deal on nuclear -- stopping nuclear weapons. I cut a deal in the Pacific Rim with 10, 12 countries -- I forget the number -- on free trade. And also the global climate deal in December, which 200 nations agreed to reduce carbon emissions. What is wrong with that argument?O'GRADY: Well, I think in Iran he surrendered. I mean, he basically told Iran that they could go ahead and get a nuclear weapon, maybe not immediately but eventually. The Pacific Rim deal is not done. I mean, he says he signed it. Now he has to get Congress to sign off on it. It's --GIGOT: It would be good. It would be generally good if it passed.O'GRADY: It won't. But I don't think he has shown a lot of leadership on trade. And on the climate, it's the same thing. There is no commitment in the climate deal. Everybody got together and signed and came away and said we have a deal. But there is no accountability. It's not clear that he really has anything.GIGOT: Quickly, Bret, is the terror threat going to be worse or improved in 2016?STEPHENS: I think it's going to be much worse. We see ISIS becoming stronger in places like Libya. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula still is undefeated. So we have a whole sort of a metastasizing jihadist problem that isn't being remotely addressed by what we're doing in Syria and Iraq.GIGOT: All right, thank you all.Still ahead, from turmoil around the globe to political turmoil here at home, 2015 saw a growing split in the GOP. We'll look at how it played out in Congress and on the campaign trail next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT: 2015 saw a growing split within the Republican Party. House Speaker John Boehner resigned from Congress this fall, brought down by an increasingly fractious GOP conference. And on the campaign trail, the divide gave rise to the political outsider with billionaire businessman, Donald Trump, consistently leading in the polls since he announced his candidacy this summer.So, Dan, what do you think these divisions are really about within the Republican Party, because they are pretty wide?HENNINGER: They are pretty wide, Paul. I would go so far as to say we're watching two presidential campaigns, one between the Republicans and the Democrats. We can identify the differences, our tax policy, the role of government. Then we have a presidential campaign being waged between Republicans and Republicans. And the issues there, I think, basically have to do with control of the party, power, whose voices speak for the party right now? You have the Freedom Caucus in the House. You have some folks on talk radio. And then something they characterize as the establishment, which I think is a fraudulent label. I think it's essentially a battle for control of the Republican Party, which is the result of the kind of disarray that has resulted over the last seven years of the Obama presidency, when these people feel not much was done to staunch the forward march of Obama's agenda.GIGOT: But there are issues in play here, too, Jason. I mean, I see the fall lines emerging on immigration and certainly on free trade, which used to be a Republican consensus, now a division.RILEY: Right.GIGOT: What else?RILEY: I'd add foreign policy into that mix. The most recent person to leave the race was a long shot, Lindsey Graham, the Senator from South Carolina. But he represents a wing of the GOP that, you know, we don't see a lot of people out there. I call it the Dick Cheney wing, the foreign policy hawk out there. That was what Lindsey Graham was representing. And the party today, you see people like Ted Cruz taking a much more isolationist stance. You don't see that hawkishness that Lindsey Graham represented. Immigration is another issue where you have people who think that the party needs to expand its base, represent a more diverse country, as we've become more diverse demographically. And you think others who think, no, it's still good politics, election politics for the GOP to play to its base.STEPHENS: But I think the fundamental division is a division about a kind of an electoral tactics. Does the Republican Party go to this base or what a lot of the people in the Freedom Caucus believe is the real base.  People, they claim, stayed home for Mitt Romney in 2012.(CROSSTALK)STEPHENS: That's what they claim. I'm not sure that's true. Or do they try to broaden the base by being a more inclusive party, a party of aspiration? I think that's really -- it's a question of is it going to be a party by identify? That's what Donald Trump's candidacy represents, or a party of aspiration? That's I think really the question facing the GOP.GIGOT: Mary, let me ask you about Congress. Do you think the Republican House is better off with Paul Ryan as speaker than John Boehner?O'GRADY: Well, I mean, Paul Ryan is a more popular figure. And John Boehner deserves a lot of credit because he tried to manage --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT: Manage all these factionsO'GRADY: Yeah, the cats, herd the cats. But Paul Ryan, for sure, I think has better skills in terms of bringing people together. And I think what's happening with Republicans, with the Republican constituency is a lot of frustration. I mean, Republicans in general believe in limited government, smaller government. And here you have President Obama, who has done so much to expand the power of the state, and the Republicans seem like they haven't been able to do anything to beat that back. And so this frustration has manifest itself in this very what they call hard right section of the Republican Party. And Paul Ryan has to find a way to bring them along, to give them confidence that longer term he has a strategy that can actually deliver.GIGOT: Some don't like Ryan either because of his immigration -- he's more open to immigration than some of the others on the right.Dan, what about Donald Trump and the presidential race? Stepping back, you pointed your finger before at President Obama and the frustrations about him. But is some of this economic? You have a lot of his -- Trump's supporters seem to be blue collar workers who haven't had a rise in real incomes in years. Is that where Trump is getting his strength?HENNINGER: Oh, yeah. I think that has a lot to do with it, Paul, the fact the economy has grown between zero and 2 percent, a weak economy for seven years. It's created a lot of anxiety out there, especially among blue collar voters. And Trump has brought their anxiety and anger to the surface. The question is, can you drive simple anger all the way into the presidency or at some point you have to offer them a more positive forward- looking vision. I think that's kind of the burden that Donald Trump bears right now and the other Republican candidates in the slip stream behind him.GIGOT: How big a danger is there, Brad? We don't have a lot of time, but how big -- today a real split, a basic divide of the GOP with maybe a third-party candidacy if he gets the nomination in 2016.STEPHENS: I think if he gets the nomination, I think that may be the end of the Republican Party as we have known it since 1856.GIGOT: You can't unify behind him?STEPHENS: Look, I think he's driving a fundamental division in the party.  If he becomes the nominee, not only are we going to a historic defeat, but a lot of people are going to walk away from that party.GIGOT: Thank you all.Still head, protesters return to American cities and American college campuses as we continue our look at the biggest stories of 2015.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT: Well, 2015 saw protests return to cities across America, not to mention, dozens of college campuses. The death of Freddie Gray while in police custody in April spurred two weeks of unrest in downtown Baltimore and reignited a debate over policing in America. And protests over racial intolerance at the University of Missouri led to the resignation of that school's president in November and spurred similar demonstrations at other colleges across the country.So, Jason, the Black Lives Matter movement emerged this year in response to those incidents. It was politically potent enough to be able to say, dictate to the Democratic presidential candidates, all of them, you cannot say ""all lives matter."" You must say Black Lives Matter. How potent is this movement?RILEY: I think it's quite potent. I think it can be with us for some time, Paul. And it's because it's become a political movement. You have political activists funding it, which I think will give it staying power.  Also, to the extent it's linked to black crime rates, and every time we see a black involved in a crime, and the media will hype that, particularly if the law enforcement official is white, this will continue. This will continue endlessly until of course black crime rates fall. And so I think it's something that can be with us for a while. It's very dangerous. It's dangerous because, A, it's based on a lie that Mike Brown in Ferguson, Missouri --(CROSSTALK)RILEY: -- was gunned down while --GIGOT: -- widespread police brutality.RILEY: -- while surrendering, which has proven to be a lie. But also it can lead to less effective policing of poor black communities, which need effective policing the most. To the extent that cops are afraid to engage, to the extent they back off, don't want to get out of their car, can lead to more violence in these neighborhoods.GIGOT: And, Mary, we've seen a revival in some of these cities, not least Baltimore, of crime and murder rates in some of these big cities. I think one of the tragedies of this politically is that you had a movement, bipartisan movement, coming together on criminal justice reform, especially for drug crimes and things like that. This may undercut that.O'GRADY: Yes, I think what's really missing here is some serious leadership in the black community. And, you know, if you look at really the disenfranchisement of the black inner-city community, a lot of it has to do with, as you say, criminal justice reform, but also education. And it's kind of ironic that the same people who are complaining about the fact that inner-city blacks are not successful economically are the same people who are blocking changes in the education system, which really confine a lot of these young black men to lives of, you know, misery in the inner city.STEPHENS: Dan said earlier this is -- we're living in an era of zero percent to 2 percent growth, and I think no group has suffered more than the black community in America. It's young black men who are not getting on the economic ladder of advancement when you raise the minimum wage or -- you're kicking a lot of those young men off of that ladder. So it's not entirely surprising that given grim economic outlooks, you're getting this kind of fervent --(CROSSTALK)RILEY: But I was just going to say, you talk about leadership, though, part of the reason this movement has staying power is because individuals like Barack Obama and Eric Holder have, in a way, sided with these protesters who want to scapegoat law enforcement. When you have backing at that level in American society, it's going to help sustain your movement.  Of course, they're doing it for politically expediency.GIGOT: Dan, I want to get you in here on the college campus question. We saw the protests spill over there. You and I are old enough to remember the 60s. That was in favor of free speech.HENNINGER: Right.GIGOT: Now we have the movement, particularly among students, of an orthodoxy that says, please, we must censor points of view that we disagree with.HENNINGER: Yeah, and it's organized I think, Paul. It's not spontaneous.  This is the left going back to eat their liberal professors who kind of opened the door to this craziness on campuses. I think it's having a political effect, Paul. If we can just push this into the presidential race, both Donald Trump and Ben Carson have spoken constantly about political correctness. I think the people supporting them feel that the sort of tolerance of this kind of behavior on campuses is a manifestation of a whole range of politically correct attitudes that have led to this kind of breakdown.GIGOT: It's deeply embedded on campuses, campuses all across the country.  It's going to be very hard to break that culture of one-sided point of view.We have to take one more break. When we come back, our panel's picks for the winners and losers of 2015.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT: Time now for our ""Hits & Misses."" This week, our panel picks the biggest winner or loser of 2015.Dan, start us off.HENNINGER: My biggest loser, Paul, is Secretary of State John Kerry, who was the handmaiden for that disastrous nuclear deal with Iran. Now, it was expected he was going to win the Nobel Peace Prize for doing that. He did not. John Kerry's long quest for the brass ring continues to fall short.GIGOT: All right.Bret?STEPHENS: The flip side of that, the big winner for me is the Ayatollah Ali Khomeini of Iran. Iran has an economy that is slightly smaller than that of greater Philadelphia. Yet, he was able to out=-negotiate not only the Americans and the Europeans but the Russians and Chinese as well.  Quite an accomplishment for a third-world fanatical dictator.GIGOT: Mary?O'GRADY: Paul, the national average interest rate on savings in this country for the last three years has been .06 percent. That's $6 a year on every $10,000 you have in the bank. A few weeks ago, the Federal Reserve raised the Fed funds rate from zero to a range of .25 to .50. So my winners this year are American savers.GIGOT: Don't spend it all in one place.(LAUGHTER)Jason?RILEY: New York's progressive mayor, Bill de Blasio, inherited a model big city in 2014 in terms of crime, quality of life. Since then, murders are up. Shootings are up. The welfare rolls have expanded. Homelessness is up. It jaw-dropping incompetence. Bill de Blasio is the loser of the year.GIGOT: My winner -- some good news about the culture -- the musical ""Hamilton"" and its writer, lead performer, Lynn Manuel Miranda, wrote it.  It's playing to sold-out audiences on Broadway. It's inventive and instructive. Our culture has degraded in many ways but I recommend you go see this. Bring your teenagers. They might learn something.GIGOT: That's it for this week's show. Thanks to my panel and to all of you for watching. I'm Paul Gigot. Happy New Year.

(FOX NEWS REPORT)GIGOT:  Welcome to this special edition of the ""Journal: Editorial Report"" as we look back at the biggest stories of 2015.  We begin with the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and the resulting global disorder as refugees pour across European borders and Russia moves to fill the leadership void in the Middle East.  Let's bring in Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; columnist, Bret Stephens; Mary Anastasia O'Grady; and Jason Riley.  So, Bret, start with you.  You wrote a book predicting the rise of global disorder and we appear to be right on time with all of the chaos emanating from Syria, in particular, but also North Africa, elsewhere.

O'GRADY:  The American people don't believe.  GIGOT:  We have some special operators on the ground.  He gradually increased that number and we're doing a bombing campaign.  He would say, Jason, we're making progress.  JASON RILEY, COLUMNIST:  It's not just that there have been setbacks.  You expect setbacks in a war against an enemy as dispersed as global terrorism is.  It's his denial that there have been these setbacks.  His insistence that ISIS is contained, that we are making progress.  People see Paris.  They see San Bernardino.

(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  That's what every president says.  RILEY:  We're making progress but it's not a messaging problem.  It's a fact that people believe what they see with their own eyes.  They see ISIS on ascendant.  They see ISIS recruiting people more and more.  And they don't see a strategy out there to defeat the enemy.  STEPHENS:  The president had a narrative.  The narrative was the tide of war is receding.  Al Qaeda is on a path to defeat.  We have turned the page on a decade of war.  And it turned out -- these are things he said in his second inaugural address, and it turns out that isn't the world we're actually living in.  So it's this disconnect from what the president is telling himself, what his advisors are telling him, and the world we're watching unfold.  GIGOT:  But in terms of this year, Dan, this -- what Bret describes, I think we made a turn from that politically, at least here from home.  I think the American public has changed.  The instinct for isolationism on the right has -- I think the rise of Islamic State has killed Rand Paul's presidential campaign, for example, as the American public now puts national security center stage.DAN HENNINGER COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR:  Well, there was a feeling for the longest time, Paul, that the ISIS, Islamic State, was all taking place over there in the Middle East.  I think the events of this year changed all that.  I mean, first there was the massacre in Paris, this extraordinary event, people driving through the streets of Paris gunning down individuals eating dinner in restaurants, then San Bernardino where it was brought home.  This made it clear to the American people that Islamic State is projecting power outside of the Middle East.  And it was going to take a much larger, more concentrated effort to contain them, that simply bombing them in Syria was not going to be sufficient.  And that, I think, is the kind of leadership that American people are looking for now.  GIGOT:  Mary, the president I think would also say, look, I actually had a pretty good year in foreign policy.  I struck the Iran deal on nuclear -- stopping nuclear weapons.  I cut a deal in the Pacific Rim with 10, 12 countries -- I forget the number -- on free trade.  And also the global climate deal in December, which 200 nations agreed to reduce carbon emissions.  What is wrong with that argument?  O'GRADY:  Well, I think in Iran he surrendered.  I mean, he basically told Iran that they could go ahead and get a nuclear weapon, maybe not immediately but eventually.  The Pacific Rim deal is not done.  I mean, he says he signed it.  Now he has to get Congress to sign off on it.  It's --GIGOT:  It would be good.  It would be generally good if it passed.  O'GRADY:  It won't.  But I don't think he has shown a lot of leadership on trade.  And on the climate, it's the same thing.  There is no commitment in the climate deal.  Everybody got together and signed and came away and said we have a deal.  But there is no accountability.  It's not clear that he really has anything.GIGOT:  Quickly, Bret, is the terror threat going to be worse or improved in 2016?STEPHENS:  I think it's going to be much worse.  We see ISIS becoming stronger in places like Libya.  Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula still is undefeated.  So we have a whole sort of a metastasizing jihadist problem that isn't being remotely addressed by what we're doing in Syria and Iraq.  GIGOT:  All right, thank you all.  Still ahead, from turmoil around the globe to political turmoil here at home, 2015 saw a growing split in the GOP.  We'll look at how it played out in Congress and on the campaign trail next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT:  2015 saw a growing split within the Republican Party.  House Speaker John Boehner resigned from Congress this fall, brought down by an increasingly fractious GOP conference.  And on the campaign trail, the divide gave rise to the political outsider with billionaire businessman, Donald Trump, consistently leading in the polls since he announced his candidacy this summer.  So, Dan, what do you think these divisions are really about within the Republican Party, because they are pretty wide?  HENNINGER:  They are pretty wide, Paul.  I would go so far as to say we're watching two presidential campaigns, one between the Republicans and the Democrats.  We can identify the differences, our tax policy, the role of government.  Then we have a presidential campaign being waged between Republicans and Republicans.  And the issues there, I think, basically have to do with control of the party, power, whose voices speak for the party right now?  You have the Freedom Caucus in the House.  You have some folks on talk radio.  And then something they characterize as the establishment, which I think is a fraudulent label.  I think it's essentially a battle for control of the Republican Party, which is the result of the kind of disarray that has resulted over the last seven years of the Obama presidency, when these people feel not much was done to staunch the forward march of Obama's agenda.  GIGOT:  But there are issues in play here, too, Jason.  I mean, I see the fall lines emerging on immigration and certainly on free trade, which used to be a Republican consensus, now a division.  RILEY:  Right.  GIGOT:  What else?  RILEY:  I'd add foreign policy into that mix.  The most recent person to leave the race was a long shot, Lindsey Graham, the Senator from South Carolina.  But he represents a wing of the GOP that, you know, we don't see a lot of people out there.  I call it the Dick Cheney wing, the foreign policy hawk out there.  That was what Lindsey Graham was representing.  And the party today, you see people like Ted Cruz taking a much more isolationist stance.  You don't see that hawkishness that Lindsey Graham represented.  Immigration is another issue where you have people who think that the party needs to expand its base, represent a more diverse country, as we've become more diverse demographically.  And you think others who think, no, it's still good politics, election politics for the GOP to play to its base.  STEPHENS:  But I think the fundamental division is a division about a kind of an electoral tactics.  Does the Republican Party go to this base or what a lot of the people in the Freedom Caucus believe is the real base.  People, they claim, stayed home for Mitt Romney in 2012.  (CROSSTALK)STEPHENS:  That's what they claim.  I'm not sure that's true.  Or do they try to broaden the base by being a more inclusive party, a party of aspiration?  I think that's really -- it's a question of is it going to be a party by identify?  That's what Donald Trump's candidacy represents, or a party of aspiration?  That's I think really the question facing the GOP.  GIGOT:  Mary, let me ask you about Congress.  Do you think the Republican House is better off with Paul Ryan as speaker than John Boehner?  O'GRADY:  Well, I mean, Paul Ryan is a more popular figure.  And John Boehner deserves a lot of credit because he tried to manage --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  Manage all these factionsO'GRADY:  Yeah, the cats, herd the cats.  But Paul Ryan, for sure, I think has better skills in terms of bringing people together.  And I think what's happening with Republicans, with the Republican constituency is a lot of frustration.  I mean, Republicans in general believe in limited government, smaller government.  And here you have President Obama, who has done so much to expand the power of the state, and the Republicans seem like they haven't been able to do anything to beat that back.  And so this frustration has manifest itself in this very what they call hard right section of the Republican Party.  And Paul Ryan has to find a way to bring them along, to give them confidence that longer term he has a strategy that can actually deliver.  GIGOT:  Some don't like Ryan either because of his immigration -- he's more open to immigration than some of the others on the right.  Dan, what about Donald Trump and the presidential race?  Stepping back, you pointed your finger before at President Obama and the frustrations about him.  But is some of this economic?  You have a lot of his -- Trump's supporters seem to be blue collar workers who haven't had a rise in real incomes in years.  Is that where Trump is getting his strength?  HENNINGER:  Oh, yeah.  I think that has a lot to do with it, Paul, the fact the economy has grown between zero and 2 percent, a weak economy for seven years.  It's created a lot of anxiety our there, especially among blue collar voters.  And Trump has brought their anxiety and anger to the surface.  The question is, can you drive simple anger all the way into the presidency or at some point you have to offer them a more positive forward- looking vision.  I think that's kind of the burden that Donald Trump bears right now and the other Republican candidates in the slip stream behind him.  GIGOT:  How big a danger is there, Brad?  We don't have a lot of time, but how big -- today a real split, a basic divide of the GOP with maybe a third-party candidacy if he gets the nomination in 2016.  STEPHENS:  I think if he gets the nomination, I think that may be the end of the Republican Party as we have known it since 1856.  GIGOT:  You can't unify behind him?  STEPHENS:  Look, I think he's driving a fundamental division in the party.  If he becomes the nominee, not only are we going to a historic defeat, but a lot of people are going to walk away from that party.  GIGOT:  Thank you all.  Still head, protesters return to American cities and American college campuses as we continue our look at the biggest stories of 2015.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT:  Well, 2015 saw protests return to cities across America, not to mention, dozens of college campuses.  The death of Freddie Gray while in police custody in April spurred two weeks of unrest in downtown Baltimore and reignited a debate over policing in America.  And protests over racial intolerance at the University of Missouri led to the resignation of that school's president in November and spurred similar demonstrations at other colleges across the country.  So, Jason, the Black Lives Matter movement emerged this year in response to those incidents.  It was politically potent enough to be able to say, dictate to the Democratic presidential candidates, all of them, you cannot say ""all lives matter.""  You must say Black Lives Matter.  How potent is this movement?  RILEY:  I think it's quite potent.  I think it can be with us for some time, Paul.  And it's because it's become a political movement.  You have political activists funding it, which I think will give it staying power.  Also, to the extent it's linked to black crime rates, and every time we see a black involved in a crime, and the media will hype that, particularly if the law enforcement official is white, this will continue.  This will continue endlessly until of course black crime rates fall.  And so I think it's something that can be with us for a while.  It's very dangerous.  It's dangerous because, A, it's based on a lie that Mike Brown in Ferguson, Missouri --(CROSSTALK)RILEY:  -- was gunned down while --GIGOT:  -- widespread police brutality.RILEY:  -- while surrendering, which has proven to be a lie.  But also it can lead to less effective policing of poor black communities, which need effective policing the most.  To the extent that cops are afraid to engage, to the extent they back off, don't want to get out of their car, can lead to more violence in these neighborhoods.  GIGOT:  And, Mary, we've seen a revival in some of these cities, not least Baltimore, of crime and murder rates in some of these big cities.  I think one of the tragedies of this politically is that you had a movement, bipartisan movement, coming together on criminal justice reform, especially for drug crimes and things like that.  This may undercut that.  O'GRADY:  Yes, I think what's really missing here is some serious leadership in the black community.  And, you know, if you look at really the disenfranchisement of the black inner-city community, a lot of it has to do with, as you say, criminal justice reform, but also education.  And it's kind of ironic that the same people who are complaining about the fact that inner-city blacks are not successful economically are the same people who are blocking changes in the education system, which really confine a lot of these young black men to lives of, you know, misery in the inner city.  STEPHENS:  Dan said earlier this is -- we're living in an era of zero percent to 2 percent growth, and I think no group has suffered more than the black community in America.  It's young black men who are not getting on the economic ladder of advancement when you raise the minimum wage or -- you're kicking a lot of those young men off of that ladder.  So it's not entirely surprising that given grim economic outlooks, you're getting this kind of fervent --(CROSSTALK)RILEY:  But I was just going to say, you talk about leadership, though, part of the reason this movement has staying power is because individuals like Barack Obama and Eric Holder have, in a way, sided with these protesters who want to scapegoat law enforcement.  When you have backing at that level in American society, it's going to help sustain your movement.  Of course, they're doing it for politically expediency.  GIGOT:  Dan, I want to get you in here on the college campus question.  We saw the protests spill over there.  You and I are old enough to remember the 60s.  That was in favor of free speech.  HENNINGER:  Right.GIGOT:  Now we have the movement, particularly among students, of an orthodoxy that says, please, we must censor points of view that we disagree with.  HENNINGER:  Yeah, and it's organized I think, Paul.  It's not spontaneous.  This is the left going back to eat their liberal professors who kind of opened the door to this craziness on campuses.  I think it's having a political effect, Paul.  If we can just push this into the presidential race, both Donald Trump and Ben Carson have spoken constantly about political correctness.  I think the people supporting them feel that the sort of tolerance of this kind of behavior on campuses is a manifestation of a whole range of politically correct attitudes that have led to this kind of breakdown.  GIGOT:  It's deeply embedded on campuses, campuses all across the country.  It's going to be very hard to break that culture of one-sided point of view.  We have to take one more break.  When we come back, our panel's picks for the winners and losers of 2015.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT:  Time now for our ""Hits & Misses.""  This week, our panel picks the biggest winner or loser of 2015.Dan, start us off.  HENNINGER:  My biggest loser, Paul, is Secretary of State John Kerry, who was the handmaiden for that disastrous nuclear deal with Iran.  Now, it was expected he was going to win the Nobel Peace Prize for doing that.  He did not.  John Kerry's long quest for the brass ring continues to fall short.  GIGOT:  All right.  Bret?STEPHENS:  The flip side of that, the big winner for me is the Ayatollah Ali Khomeini of Iran.  Iran has an economy that is slightly smaller than that of greater Philadelphia.  Yet, he was able to out=-negotiate not only the Americans and the Europeans but the Russians and Chinese as well.   Quite an accomplishment for a third-world fanatical dictator.  GIGOT:  Mary?  O'GRADY:  Paul, the national average interest rate on savings in this country for the last three years has been .06 percent.  That's $6 a year on every $10,000 you have in the bank.  A few weeks ago, the Federal Reserve raised the Fed funds rate from zero to a range of .25 to .50.  So my winners this year are American savers.  GIGOT:  Don't spend it all in one place.  (LAUGHTER)Jason?  RILEY:  New York's progressive mayor, Bill de Blasio, inherited a model big city in 2014 in terms of crime, quality of life.  Since then, murders are up.  Shootings are up.  The welfare rolls have expanded.  Homelessness is up.  It jaw-dropping incompetence.  Bill de Blasio is the loser of the year.  GIGOT:  My winner -- some good news about the culture -- the musical ""Hamilton"" and its writer, lead performer, Lynn Manuel Miranda, wrote it.  It's playing to sold-out audiences on Broadway.  It's inventive and instructive.  Our culture has degraded in many ways but I recommend you go see this.  Bring your teenagers.  They might learn something.  GIGOT:  That's it for this week's show.  Thanks to my panel and to all of you for watching.  I'm Paul Gigot.  Happy New Year.  We hope to see you right here next week as we look ahead to 2016.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: I'm Dana Perino and this is a Fox News alert. Thank you for you for joining us on this special midnight edition of ""The Five."" It's a big night for Donald Trump as the GOP frontrunner scores primary victories in at least three states, North Carolina, Illinois, and Florida. That's where he knocked out his rival, Marco Rubio, on his home turf, and soon after, the senator from Florida suspended his campaign. But in Ohio, John Kasich came away with a big win in his home state, his first victory and all of Ohio's 66 delegates. Ted Cruz has yet to win tonight but shows no sign of slowing down in his campaign. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton has so far beaten Bernie Sanders in Ohio, Florida, and North Carolina. Many Republicans are still undecided about Donald Trump but tonight, Trump once again vowed to bring the party together.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The fact is, we have to bring our party together. We have to bring it together. We have something happening that actually makes the Republican Party probably the biggest political story anywhere in the world. Everybody's writing about it all over Europe, all over the world they're talking about it. Millions of people are coming in to vote. This was an example of it today, and it's just a different thing. We have a great opportunity and the people that are voting, Democrats are coming in, independents are coming in, and very, very importantly, people that never voted before. It's an incredible thing.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Well Kimberly, this is what you were talking about last week. This was dubbed Titanic Tuesday, and so you have three of the five states going to Donald Trump.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Yes, so Leo DiCaprio had a big night, right? Titanic Tuesday. Look, I thought this was a very big night for Donald Trump. I don't think anybody can take it away from him. He did very well. Ted Cruz, it would have been great for him to at least have won one of these contests tonight, we still have one to call, correct. So we'll see what happens there. Marco Rubio, a lot of people thought that perhaps he was going to have to step down and suspend if he did not take his home state. In fact, he did. So I think that benefits Ted Cruz and there seems to be somewhat of an episode of ""Survivor"" strategic alliance that has emerged there, and then John Kasich, of course, really encouraged by the fact that he had Ohio, which he needed to do.PERINO: Right, and so the homes state advantage really working against Marco Rubio, Eric, but in Ohio, for Kasich, who came in late, sort of late July is when he entered into the race. He said that he was going to win Ohio and that if he did not win Ohio, he was going to get out of the race. Having won tonight, I think that he'll stick it out.ERIC BOLLING, CO- HOST: He did. He had a very nice speech. His victory speech was very sweet. He's a nice guy. He's a really nice guy. He still has 136 delegates total. Trump put down, so far, about 200 delegates. There's still about another 107 left to be divvied up based on the proportionality. We still haven't heard about Missouri, yet. Illinois, we haven't broken down Illinois, North Carolina, some of the other states, so we're still waiting to find out the numbers, but again, I'll do the numbers later, but this was a very resounding win for Donald Trump and you heard it in his victory speech. His speech was different. It wasn't as cocky as it used to be. It seemed like he said, let's be united, let's unite the party together. It's going to be me, this is Trump saying, it's going to be me, so let's get it together now rather than fight this out. I don't know that John Kasich staying in is -- it might even actually help Donald Trump at this point. Now that Marco Rubio is out, now you have, you would have had one alternative to Donald Trump, Ted Cruz. Now you have two so you're actually going to split the alternative to Donald Trump vote between two, and it may actually create a path for Donald Trump better. With both of them still in, the establishment types, it was a different story, because then you could suck delegates from both. I don't know, they may want to rethink this or figure out how they want to take this going forward.PERINO: Well, since we've mentioned him a couple of times, and since this was really big news tonight, let's go to Marco Rubio who announced that it was the end of his campaign. Let's take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: After tonight, it is clear that while we are on the right side, this year, we will not be on the winning side.While this may not have been the year for a hopeful and optimistic message about our future, I still remain hopeful and optimistic about America.While it is not God's plan that I be president in 2016, or maybe ever, and while today my campaign is suspended, the fact that I've even come this far is evidence of how special America truly is.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Rubio also issued a warning against the so-called politics of resentment which he says is damaging the GOP and the nation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUBIO: The politics of resentment against other people will not just leave us a fractured party, they're going to leave us a fractured nation.While this may not have been the year for a hopeful and optimistic message about our future, I still remain hopeful and optimistic about America.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: All right, Greg, let's get your thoughts on the big development tonight. Trump winning the three states, Kasich winning Ohio, and you had Marco Rubio decide to suspend his campaign.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Well probably the most sensible assessment of Rubio's downfall probably comes from Mickey Kaus, who said that you look at somebody like Rubio who has all of these positives, and he seemed to be performing best against Hillary, however there was one thing that brought him down, and it was immigration. And when Trump made it that issue, there was no way Rubio could ever get back up and reach a stature on that level because that was the thing that was bringing him down. Trump, I think, people talk about the insider versus outsider -- I don't think it's about that. I think it's about immunity. Where Obama, and I said this before, had the historical first immunity, the first black candidate, that allowed him a measure of immunity about his history, a lot of people, he didn't have all the, he didn't have a long resume of achievement, it didn't matter. Trump had an immunity bubble and has it today as being an entertainer. And this is a first for the Republican Party. In order to be able to stay whatever you want and not have people come after you, that is a new thing, and I think that's what is refreshing and what is changing the Republican Party. People aren't used to this sort of thing. Republican Party is always being used to being attacked for being sexist or being mean, and basically, what Trump is saying is, I don't care. And it seems to be working. In fact, it's working now more than ever.GUILFOYLE: I was going to say, I like the point that you made about that because it's very interesting and also true. One of the first things that resonated with Trump was the fact that he said, we're going to build a wall, we're going to make Mexico pay for it. I was like, wow, this is such a big, bold statement, and then there was the juxtaposition that was really laid out that I think was like the albatross around Marco Rubio's neck, which was the gang of eight, and they kept throwing that kind of phrase at him that he was associated, and it sort of elevated Ted Cruz who wasn't, and Donald Trump who had a specific grandiose plan to build a wall and to be hard on immigration and that's kind of what started Trump off and ultimately what kind of did Marco in.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well there's no indication in the polling tonight, among Republicans, that immigration was a critical issue. Zero.PERINO: It's been the fourth most important issue in every Republican exit poll since we've started --WILLIAMS: And when you say fourth, you're talking about single digits, maybe like 12, 15 percent. So that's just not the reason. I am curious, because I'm very curious about why Rubio fell off the table and I think I go back to the idea that it was when he started to go mano a mano with Trump, and people said, you know, I like the optimistic, sweet Marco Rubio. I'm not so crazy about Marco Rubio talking about hand size and --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't think that's it, either.WILLIAMS: But I think something had to happen. The other thing is, when you talk about Marco Rubio, you got to say, well what was the message? What was the message of his campaign, and I think people worry about --PERINO: Before Trump attacked Marco Rubio, the Right to Rise PAC spent $30 million attacking him for being not ready. Not ready was the description, and then when Trump came in with the little Marco, as in, you're not ready and you're too young --WILLIAMS: Don't forget Chris Christie.PERINO: -- even though he's the same age as --WILLIAMS: Chris Christie went after Marco Rubio in New Hampshire --BOLLING: And Jeb --WILLIAMS: Jeb spent a ton, in his home state.BOLLING: Jeb spent a lot of money.GUTFELD: There's another thing, too. We talked about this when this started. There were 17 candidates. And when you had 17 people and one of them is Donald Trump, Donald Trump appears much different and apart from them because they were all senators and governors and what not, a doctor. But Trump stood out. And one of the reasons why he stood out was his use of social networks before anybody else. It's like when you go to airline counter, your flight's cancelled, you can't get anything done. You go on Twitter and you tweet about Virgin Air or you tweet about United Airlines. Trump did the same thing with the media. He took his Twitter feed and turned it into a channel of expression and nobody had done that before --PERINO: And it cost nothing.GUTFELD: And it cost nothing. And then all of a sudden, that builds and that builds and he got the, I don't know, what is it, a billion in free advertising through media when you put it all together.WILLIAMS: See, now to me, what happened tonight was, Trump had a fantastic night, I think. I think he really has now control of the narrative. He's still got do a tremendous amount. I think he's still got to win more than 50 percent of the remaining delegates. But the thing is that right now, all the momentum, all the talk, all the media is going to be, hail the new king of the Republican party, the new standard bearer for the party. The problem with this is, he's now calling for unity, but I don't know if so many of the Republicans who voted tonight who did not vote for Trump are willing to play ball. According to what Fox was able to report, it's like 60 percent of non-Trump voters say they would consider a third party candidate and that they won't vote for Trump.GUTFELD: You have to identify those voters as people who, what you would call in the old days, as hard to get, right? It's like, if you want to bring the party together, it doesn't work with peer pressure. You don't go, it's like saying, everybody else is doing it so you should do it too. You have to go beyond that and appeal to them and understand, why are they hard to get? And then you start there and you work on it.BOLLING: And also, Juan, as you know, as it gets whittled down to whether, let's say it's Trump who gets the nomination, those people say they would never vote for Donald Trump, when it's down to Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, you know a good percentage of them are going to say, you know, I didn't think I could ever do it but I don't want two more terms of Barack Obama. I'm going to vote for Donald Trump. Hold my nose, here's the guy I'd rather have than Hillary.WILLIAMS: Here's the way I'm hearing this from political insiders is, right now, if you nominated, let's say Rubio -- he's gone, so let's just use Rubio as a stand-in, and it's Rubio versus Hillary Clinton, the entire focus would be on, you know, Hillary Clinton, I don't know about her trustworthiness. Remember that Benghazi? Lots of lines of attack. But with Donald Trump, the whole focus is going to be on Donald Trump and all the things he said, all the things he's done, all the people he --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't know if that affected him, though.WILLIAMS: What?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All the negatives that we, that everyone --WILLIAMS: Why do you think that 60 percent of Republicans who didn't vote for him don't want to vote for him?BOLLING: But when it's time to pull a lever or drop the ballot in the box, they end up voting for him at 47 percent. 47 percent.WILLIAMS: Granted, that's among a very limited universe. He says he brings in new voters, and the question is -- my point to you is, going into a general election, if you're talking about independents and Democrats, he's going to have a hard time.BOLLING: You don't think he's going to bring Democrats over? Of course he's going to bring Democrats over.GUTFELD: This points to the other things that --BOLLING: He's doing it now.PERINO: Guys, we have to wrap up but we have another block. Can you make a last point?GUTFELD: Yes. What we're talking about is the behavioral change that Donald Trump has been alluding to that we saw a piece of at the speech tonight that he's going to be a kinder, gentler Trump. This is going to be the most eagerly anticipated transition since Bruce became Caitlyn.PERINO: All right. We're going to keep going. Don't go away. We'll have more analysis on tonight's primaries and up next, we're going to hear from Texas senator, Ted Cruz, and Governor John Kasich. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Welcome back. Fox News now projects Hillary Clinton will narrowly defeat Bernie Sanders in the Illinois Democratic primary. Meanwhile, on the GOP side, Missouri is still up for grabs, but other than that, Ted Cruz failed to win any state tonight. Despite that, he says he's still the only candidate that can beat Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Only two campaigns have a plausible path to the nomination; ours and Donald Trump's. Nobody else has any mathematical possibility whatsoever. Only one campaign has beaten Donald Trump over and over and over again. Not once, not twice, not three times, but nine times, all across the country.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: OK, and as we mentioned, so Ted Cruz so far has failed to win state. Tonight, Missouri still up for grabs and we'll bring that to you as soon as we have it. Eric, let's go over the math because he said that, himself, and then also, Donald Trump are the only people that have a path, statistic probability, to secure the nomination.BOLLING: Well he's right because Kasich would now need more than 112 percent going forward which is statistically impossible, so he's done, he's mathematically out. Ted Cruz could do it, but he'd have to win an insane, some 80 percent of the final delegates. That's likely not going to happen. So you end up with Donald Trump, who does have a statistical probability of still getting it. I'm going to do it on the whiteboard in the next block, but --GUTFELD: Why do you keep doing that? (laughter)BOLLING: Because I love the whiteboard. And by the way, the whiteboard has been right straight through. If you think about it, we go back 3 or 4 times, it's predicted this. But look, Ted Cruz has a rough -- the states coming up, it doesn't look good for him going forward. The states coming, well, Arizona, but then we get into the Northeast. New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, tough for him. So, I love the fact that -- by the way, Cruz bots who are going to like blast my Twitter tonight, I love the fact that they're in it and I love the fact that there's two GOP potential candidates going at it, it's great, it's great for the party, but at some point you've got to say OK, this is going to be his. You just have to.GUILFOYLE: Well the interesting part is, Dana, if you look at the past in terms of the states and the caucuses that Ted Cruz was able to secure, and then you try to look forward to the type of appeal that he has with evangelicals and some other people, but Donald Trump has done quite well with them as well, what could be potentially his path going forward versus Kasich?PERINO: Well, evangelicals split tonight, as they had in other places, although I think that Ted Cruz had closed a little bit of that gap from before in the states that voted today. Also, I don't think any this is a foregone conclusion and I think it's a disservice to say so. Rubio's people today said, well one of his policy guys said, it's time for anyone who supported Marco Rubio to harness that disappointment and to support Ted Cruz. So mathematically, it only really matters if you get to 1,237 or not. And if you don't, basically it goes to a contested convention where all sorts of different things could happen. So I would look at that. On the Cruz campaign, I have to say that it has one of the best organizations I've ever seen, in terms of its ground game is excellent and they're quiet about it. They don't brag. They spend little money. They've actually been extremely well managed and that's a credit to the candidate.GUILFOYLE: And then of course Kasich securing Ohio tonight, but a lot of people saying it should just come down to Trump and come down to Cruz. But Kasich's not getting out anytime soon, Eric. I'm beginning to think in terms of what you brought up about the math, but it actually, I think, hurts Cruz that Kasich stays in. Greg --GUTFELD: Well, I don't know. I'd go back to my only question, who could beat Hillary? And I know that right now, it's between Cruz and Trump, and I look at Cruz, and he is a conservative that Democrats could really hate. You know what I'm saying? He's ideologically pure, he's strident, and I think that people say they'll be happy to run against Trump, they might be happier to run against Cruz.GUILFOYLE: Yes, and I think you're right. Because a lot of the Hillary insiders that I know, they're more worried about Donald Trump because nobody expected him to get this far. He also has that crossover populous appeal to be able to get to moderates or to independents and peel off some Democrats from her because Cruz is a much more polarizing, because like you said, of this pure ideological conservatism.WILLIAMS: Well I think that is kind of a hopeful vision, because what we know is, if you look at head to head matchups, Hillary Clinton beats him. So, people talk about, is there a road for Ted Cruz? And I think for Ted Cruz, if I was Republican, I would say, he's a Republican. I know he's a Republican. I know he's a conservative. And I think you're going to hear this from Ted Cruz in the days to come. And I think he will hit hard on the idea of, who is a real conservative in this race. And the second thing I would say --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They need to get Kasich out.WILLIAMS: Well he's not getting out. (CROSSTALK) We talked about the Northeast and I think Kasich could do well in the Northeast. I don't see Cruz -- once we go west, oh boy, I think that opens lots of doors for Ted Cruz potentially, and remember, the scenario is not for them, for Cruz or Kasich to get to 1,237. It's to block Donald Trump from getting to that number so they can force it into a convention --BOLLING: You don't feel like it's starting to get beyond that now? After tonight, it just feels like the tone is changing to like, look, if he's going to walk away with 60 or 70 percent of the state's delegates and 45, 47 percent of the votes --WILLIAMS: Don't be fooled by the passions and the celebration tonight. The reality is that if you are Ted Cruz, if you are John Kasich, you're saying to yourself, we can win at a convention.GUILFOYLE: All right, well speaking of John Kasich, after his big win in his home state of Ohio tonight, John Kasich vows to keep pushing forward with his campaign.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. JOHN KASICH, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I want you to know the campaign goes on and I also want you to know that it's been my intention to make you proud. It's been my intention to have young people all across this country watch somebody enter into politics, even though I labored in obscurity for so long, people counting me out -- well guess what? Tomorrow, I'm going to Philadelphia.And then I'm going, I don't know, all over the country, OK?We're going to go all the way to Cleveland and secure the Republican nomination.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Big night and nice speech from John Kasich, Dana. He was obviously very enthused and his supporters really came out. That was kind of his like long game that he was planning on was to take Ohio.PERINO: And an 80 percent approval rating in Ohio as a second term governor. Most second term governors do not have anywhere near that kind of an approval. When he ran for reelection he won all but two counties, 88 counties. It's a starkly different choice. He has a long term strategy and it is starkly different. The key to remember is, a Republican must win Ohio, and that Hillary Clinton won Ohio tonight is a good sign for her. If Bernie Sanders had won Ohio, I think the Hillary campaign would have been sufficiently worried that they wouldn't be able to pull off a general election victory.WILLIAMS: I think people are going to worry a little bit that John Kasich didn't win New Hampshire if you think back. And he sat in New Hampshire, remember? He put all his eggs in -- and he thought he could win and he didn't do it, and now he comes and he wins his home state. Well, does that mean he's going to really -- I come back to Eric's point. Why are you there? Except that you think you can block Trump.BOLLING: Yes. And that's the only path to a nomination is getting to Cleveland and then somehow going -- which looks like it's going to be a third place finish and somehow, the powers that be decide you're the president --WILLIAMS: So let me ask you, does anybody at the table think that Kasich might get together with Cruz?PERINO: And do what?GUILFOYLE: For a debate next week.GUTFELD: The one thing that Kasich said, and it's worth bringing up, is that he would not take the low road to the highest office. This was a time where that doesn't matter. We are in a new era where there is no such thing as a low road.GUILFOYLE: And there were so many people in this campaign, I mean, this, you know, the debates and running against each other to begin with. A lot, 17.PERINO: I was just going to say, for the 40 percent of Republicans that voted today that said they would not support Trump in a general election, that did matter to them. So how would you unite in that scenario, I don't know. I'm waiting to see it.GUILFOYLE: Well, there has been lots of surprises and I'm sure there will be quite a few more and some more midnight (inaudible) but the question is, will John Kasich's win in Ohio lead the GOP towards a contested convention? That's coming up next right here on ""The Five"", we're live, stay with us. More election analysis.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Welcome back to a special midnight edition of ""The Five."" Despite Trump winning the majority of delegates tonight, there's still talks of a contested convention. Earlier in the evening Newt Gingrich warned against that.(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER: I think it's insane. You live in an age of television and social media, millions and millions of people will have voted. You have - you have two really strong personalities. I mean, Trump and Cruz are not exactly, you know, shrinking violets.The idea somebody is going to magically appear and push those two guys aside? My hunch is that they would probably join forces to block any third person from emerging just out of sheer anger. I mean, these are both antiestablishment, fundamental reform, disrupt the system candidates. They're not going to turn this over to somebody who represents the establishment.(END VIDEOCLIP)GUTFELD: You know, it really does highlight -- it really highlights how bifurcated the GOP is right now, whether they can pull it back together or not, a brokered convention, as Newt points out, when you have Donald Trump and Ted Cruz getting the vast majority of votes.GUILFOYLE: Yes, I mean, nobody likes to be cheated out of wins or to have the votes of people, you know, disenfranchised and not counting. I mean, I don't think that's going to be good for the Republican party.There was a lot of people that were, you know, are gunning for the 17 candidates, going after it, a lot of incredible debates, many of them on this network. We learned a lot about it. So, people were able to make informed choices, those choices, those voices should be heard.I hope that this works in the way that it should, that we actually have, you know, a nominee and someone is able to secure those delegates, you know, fair and square. And I think what Newt said is actually a point well taken, why would they give it up to John Kasich if the point is to be somebody who's outside of Washington, outside of the D.C. power play, you know, corruption business as usual to do something new and fresh, to bring in new voters, new voices to the party. I don't think they're going to, like, take a knee any time soon for John Kasich.BOLLING: And then the other side of that coin is because that's the rule.PERINO: Well, yes. I mean, just imagine if it were the other way around. Let's say that Donald Trump was in the position of Kasich right now or that his strategy had to be to try to block somebody from getting 1,237. Do you really think the people would be complaining about the rules at that point? I doubt it.So, the rules are the rules and it doesn't mean that if you go to - I think what Newt was talking about, I believe, was a brokered convention.GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: And a contested convention, that is what - that had been the norm up until the last, I guess, six elections. That had been how it had worked, that you would get to the convention, and delegates vote, and you - - It doesn't mean that Donald Trump or that Ted Cruz wouldn't emerge as the nominee...GUILFOYLE: From that.PERINO: ... out of that.GUILFOYLE: Right, so --BOLLING: What are your thought - where - where are you on this?GUTFELD: Well, I -- I'm always interested in why are people resistant right now to Trump over this. And I think that there's something - as a conservative that you have a - you have a deep resistance to autocracy, the autocrat.We talk about this being a outsider versus insider, but it's - it's less about him being antiestablishment for some people than it is that he approximates the strong man personality of a Chavez or a -- you know, it's the idea that people like him because he's a authoritarian figure. And I think that is what makes people suspicious. So, when you hear about him changing, you hope, well, is he going to be less of an authoritarian? That's where I think people are most worried about.It's not about outsider or insider, it's about whether this person is pure emotion and authoritarian ego, or is he actually, you know, is he a real conservative?WILLIAMS: So, here's - here's the way I'm thinking about this. Look, it's been a lot of TV here. I mean, he is just a tremendous entertainer. Even tonight when he was trying not to intervene...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.WILLIAMS: ... everybody is watching, everybody is anticipating what's he going to say. The fact...PERINO: He was funny about the ad.WILLIAMS: Yes. Cory Londata (ph)...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (inaudible)WILLIAMS: Yes, everybody is, oh, you know, don't forget about the conflict he had and he has him standing behind him. He didn't have the stakes in the water, but, I mean, he still - there's still drama attached to Trump no matter what he does.GUILFOYLE: But he was very nice about Rubio tonight.WILLIAMS: Right.GUILFOYLE: Right, I thought that was very good.WILLIAMS: But if you're an insider in terms of GOP politics, you're not paying attention to the personality. You know what you care about? Do I keep the Senate? Do I keep control in terms of the majority in the House of Representatives? How are we going to do in state houses? How are we going to do in city halls?And you know what? If you're in Washington and you're in a Republican leadership right now, if you're Mitch McConnell, Senate majority leader, you're thinking, oh, my god, I -- this could be a disaster, this could be real trouble. So you're worried about it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If he loses.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, that's right.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If he doesn't lose, then they're in good shape.BOLLING: We'll do this very quickly, okay? All right, the white board. Here it is. Here are the totals as of show time right now. The delegates, 619, 394, 167, 136. As a percentage, Trump has 47 percent of the delegates right now, 30 percent to Cruz. You can see the other numbers. Trump has won 19 of the 30 contests so far, that's 63 percent, Cruz 7 and 23 percent. If you apply the 63 percent to the numbers going forward, because winner take all and winner take most, that helps the person who wins the most the most. It's - it's a wash, he gets there easily.If you do it the hard way and say he's only winning 47 percent of all the delegates right now and apply it to that number right there, 1,300 and 16, that number, 47 percent of 1, 316 is 618 delegates. Do the math. I swear to god, you can't make this stuff up. 618 plus 619, which he already has right here.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He clears the threshold.BOLLING: Guess what it is? He hits it, 1,237 to the number, to the number. It's incredible. And that's on the - the tougher route.WILLIAMS: You know, even it - you know, just assuming all you say is right, that's why people think they can stop him, because if they can - and that's still a hell of a challenge.BOLLING: Okay, we'll leave it there. (inaudible) said his head is going to explode after the numbes.Big night for Hillary tonight. She gave quite a speech, you're going to hear from her later. Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: Hillary Clinton having a big night, winning four states. Missouri is still too close to call. Isn't that like Missouri? She's likely to be the Democratic nominee. Here's what she thinks the next president needs to be ready for.(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I saw President Obama wrestle with the decision to send Navy S.E.A.L.s after Osama bin Laden, the decision to rescue the auto industry, to fight for the Affordable Care Act, and so many more. Our next president has to be ready to face three big tasks. First, can you make positive differences in peoples' lives? Second, can you keep us safe? Third, can you bring our country together again?(END VIDEOCLIP)GUTFELD: I could listen to her voice all night. In fact, I think I just did. All right, this is -- that - that's - that collection of sound drives me crazy. Because - just what we -PERINO: What was she saying?GUTFELD: Okay, so what she said was she praised President Obama, and then when she's done praising him, she says we need to bring our country back together again. She just contradicted herself.PERINO: I mean, it's difficult when you are trying to win a third term of the White House as a party because every election is about hope and change, or should be.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: So she's trying to straddle this fence. The thing I thought was strange is that when I hear her speech tonight, if I had read it, I would have thought inspiring, decent speech. But then I hear it and I'm thinking, why is she - why is there no joy?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.PERINO: Why isn't she happy? She should be - she just won. Then I read some people from the left looking -- listening to her speech and they loved it. So, there is -- 40 percent of the people in America are probably settled on her as the one they want. Another 40 percent, the one they will never vote for, so it's just a very small margin of error and people that she could persuade to vote for her.GUILFOYLE: I mean, my gosh.GUTFELD: You're going to explode, aren't you?GUILFOYLE: I really can't take it actually because I just don't think she's going to be that hard to beat. I think she's unbelievably horrible candidate. We are almost, like, disfigured at the table every time we hear her voice. Everyone is making faces. Well, that's the truth.GUTFELD: No, that's just how I look, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: She's not a good candidate. Well, okay, thanks. Yes, even in make up. This is what people think, like, wait a second, this is somebody who is going to be the other side of, like, the Franklin commemorative plate of Barack Obama. Is that what you want? No, you don't.So, how could someone not beat Hillary Clinton? She's not the candidate that Barack Obama, or her husband, was. So, I think that she's very easy to beat.WILLIAMS: I'm having a flash back.GUILFOYLE: And...(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I'm having a flashback.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I put something in your drink.WILLIAMS: I think so, it's late, but I will say, I think I've heard this rap from Republicans and it went like, oh, Mitt Romney can't lose, oh, Mitt Romney can't lose after 2010 and the Affordable Care Act. Let me tell you, Hillary Clinton, not only did she have a great night, but I think that right now she had to give a speech with that kind of punch because she's trying to stir the base. Donald Trump was really quiet and reserved tonight, didn't have the press conference (ph), because his based is stirred. He's talking about unifying the party. When Hillary talks about unifying the country, I don't think she's talking in response to Barack Obama, she's talking in response to Donald Trump.BOLLING: Just very quickly, I love all kinds of music, pop, classical, classic rock, jazz, blues.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Country.BOLLING: I just - I can't get into - I can't -- something in my brain will not allow me to like country music. Hillary Clinton is singing country music to country music lovers. They're all just -- no matter what she says...UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So true.BOLLING: ... they're buying into it, and they're not - they're not hearing what the -- they're just loving it.GUILFOYLE: She could be like, let's not make America too great again, and they'll be like, yes, Hillary, great speech.BOLLING: And whatever the worst genre of music that you can't stand, that's like - that's what I feel when I listen to her.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: You have book tour coming up, you better change your tune.BOLLING: I know. No, I'll try.WILLIAMS: By the way, so somebody said to me yesterday, said they watched the show yesterday, they said to me, so what do you and Eric really disagree about? And I said, well, I think he likes rap music.BOLLING: I do.WILLIAMS: And I'm not crazy about it.BOLLING: I do.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MAKE: ... loves rap music.WILLIAMS: He likes that -- that violent, go-get-'em --BOLLING: Well, I like all of that --WILLIAMS: Kendrick Lamar, right?(CROSSTALK) Well --BOLLING: But he's not really a violent go-getter.PERINO: I think there's something to remember about Democrats versus Republicans and progressives. Progressives very much want to retain power and they care a lot more about policy than they care about the personality or the principles. And that is one of the reasons that if you look at the electoral math, it does work in her favor with about 246 of the 270 votes already locked up.GUTFELD: Hm. All right. Well, still unknown. Will Ted Cruz or Donald Trump win Missouri? That's a state. The results could come at any minute. Stay with ""The Five.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: At this moment we're still watching the results out of Missouri. Both races too close to call with 99 percent of the precincts reporting. We'll bring you the breaking results as soon as they come in.In the meanwhile, our final thoughts. Let me say, I thought Bernie Sanders was going to have a better night tonight. He didn't. After Michigan last week, I thought he was going -- had the potential for an upset in Ohio. Just didn't happen. He may still win Missouri. We don't know.I thought Marco Rubio was going to do better than he actually did. He underperformed in my estimation. Donald Trump overperformed in the state of Florida. And I think Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, big nights.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: What did you say (ph)? They had a Titanic night.WILLIAMS: Because I was picking up on your language, Titanic.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Tuesday -- we were calling it that -- yeah. I think Donald Trump had a huge night, despite all the negative advertising going after him. He still was able to have a huge night. He still may also pull off Missouri and so might Hillary Clinton. So huge nights for the two of them. John Kasich obviously did well in Ohio. He was expected to. Hugely popular governor there. So you would expect that he would do well. Ted Cruz, I do not think had a good night, obviously, at all, because he didn't manage to win any of these states thus far. We'll see what happens in Missouri.WILLIAMS: Dr. Bolling.BOLLING: You know who had a huge night?WILLIAMS: Who is that?BOLLING: Fox had a huge night. Amazing coverage. Megyn and Bret did a great job. You guys were wonderful all night. But I'll tell you, I'm want to give a big shout out to the people on the 12th floor, the polling people, the people who are analyzing.WILLIAMS: They did a good job.BOLLING: Crunching all the numbers. Those are my kind of people. I was hanging out with them for like three hours today. They are awesome and they're nailing the numbers. So -- and by the way, they said they are going to watch. I'm going to test you tomorrow, so you got to watch.WILLIAMS: Dana Perino, final thoughts?PERINO: I'm trying to think of one because it's been a long day. I'm looking at my notes and there -- I think I have said all I need to say. I do think that this never Trump campaign, it's not going away. And it's not going to magically disappear. Maybe 50 percent -- let's just say even at 50 percent of it went away, that's still a big gap for Republicans as a party to try to pull together, no matter what the party is going to look like at the end of this. If it's going in a populist direction or a conservative direction, you are going to have people that -- 40 percent of them said they would not support Donald Trump in a general election. That's not including the 60 percent that said that they would vote for a third party. So I think -- I don't know how it's going to turn out. But brace yourself because it's not going to be easy.WILLIAMS: But I -- At the end of this very long night --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: I feel bad. Because then they're going to let Hillary Clinton pick the next two to three Supreme Court nominees. Try and sleep well at night with that.WILLIAMS: All right. To sum up this wonderful night, this Titanic Tuesday, I turn to Dr. Gutfeld.GUTFELD: I would say that people see both political parties as drive through restaurants. They get up to that little speaker and they put in their order and by the time they get to the window, the order is always wrong. So I think --GUILFOYLE: That's Joe Pesci.GUTFELD: Yeah -- you -- so then you have Sanders and you have Trump opening up restaurants across the road offering some very exciting alternatives.PERINO: McDowell.WILLIAMS: There we go.GUTFELD: Yeah, McDowell.WILLIAMS: ""One More Thing"" up next on this late night.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: It's time now for ""One More Thing."" Eric's kicking us off.BOLLING: Okay. This is one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time. This is Mr. Owl Man on Reddit and YouTube. He put this compilation together. Check it out. Roll it. Remember that? Remember that? There's Bernie -- Bernie -- scaring Donald Trump.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Clearly, we don't want to make fun of a serious situation. But that was kind of funny.PERINO: We shouldn't laugh at that. But it is funny.GUILFOYLE: It looked like Donald was going to kick him like --BOLLING: Of course you can laugh.WILLIAMS: You know, Fox wanted to have them in a debate. I thought that would have been a great idea.PERINO: (Inaudible) next.WILLIAMS: All right. So some big news slipping by the media these days. An NFL official acknowledging the link between brain disease and football. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you think there is a link between football and degenerative brain disorders like CTE?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well certainly, Dr. McKee's research shows that a number of retired NFL players were diagnosed with CTE. So the answer to that question is certainly yes. But there's also a number of questions that come with that.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: That was the NFL's senior vice president for health and safety and that's a big admission. I don't know how the papers aren't covering it.PERINO: Hmm. Maybe they will now.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: (Inaudible) at 1:00 a.m. Eastern.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Juan a.m.WILLIAMS: Thank you.BOLLING: Juan.PERINO: All right. I got this --GUILFOYLE: For Juan more thing.PERINO: I've got this veteran race horse named Morstead (ph) -- my ""One More Thing."" He modeled the first tweed suit designed specifically for a horse before the horses started racing at England's Cheltenham -- festival today. It's a three-piece suit. He -- the designer, Emma Sandham-King, said it was -- that he was a pleasure to work with. Can you imagine? And also it took four weeks to complete, used 10 times as much fabric as the equivalent of a human suit.GUTFELD: You know, if somebody was watching this and fell asleep, they would swear that they dreamt that they saw a horse wearing a suit. I had the craziest dream. A horse was wearing a suit.PERINO: It was tweed.GUTFELD: And it was tweed.BOLLING: On Fox.GUTFELD: On Fox.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)PERINO: And then I saw Kimberly and then I woke up.GUTFELD: You know what, really quick, this is a very disturbing trend. We're seeing a rise in drunk giraffes. These are giraffes that go to bars, they get wasted. Take a look at this guy. He has no idea where he is right now. He's just trashed. By the way, that is how giraffes run. When you have legs like that, which I don't, that's how you run. Yeah. There you go.WILLIAMS: He's having fun.GUTFELD: He certainly is, Juan. He certainly is.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: Okay. Kimberly, we have a minute and a half. Take your time.GUILFOYLE: Oh, Fox News would like to call -- No, just kidding. Me, personally, on my own nonsponsored Guilfoyle -- Yeah, I'm going to call Guam and yeah -- I'd like to call a lot of things. But yeah. All right. So this is so cute, because I was never a cat person, but it just shows that people can change.GUTFELD: That's true.GUILFOYLE: And this one video made me rethink things. And this is the tiniest, cutest little cat. Very nice, perfect posture. Clapping, clapping, clapping for her dehydrated fish snack. Tell me that's not the cutest thing you've ever seen.GUTFELD: That's actually me in my pajamas.PERINO: That is -- Do you know how bad your hands would smell if you were hand-feeding a cat that fish snack?GUILFOYLE: I know. But it looks like the little picture you sent me, Greg, of you in your shorty robe.GUTFELD: Yeah, it's true.GUILFOYLE: But you really did send me (inaudible) on my phone.GUTFELD: It is on your phone. You can look at it later.PERINO: Can you show it to us? Because we have a little extra time. Anybody else?GUILFOYLE: I would like to make a prediction.GUTFELD: Yes, what?GUILFOYLE: A Guilfoyle news alert prediction to call -- I'm sorry -- for Hillary Clinton and I think Trump is going to squeak it out.PERINO: All right. That's it for us tonight. But don't change the channel. Keep watching Fox News throughout the night for live Super Tuesday election analysis. That's it for us. Good night.BOLLING: Yay. I'm going home and going to sleep.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 Roll Call, Inc.
