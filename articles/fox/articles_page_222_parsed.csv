 Pegging Roberts' Politics 
"	"This is a partial transcript of ""Special Report With Brit Hume,"" August 5, 2005, that has been edited for clarity.Watch ""Special Report With Brit Hume"" weeknights at 6 p.m. ETJIM ANGLE, GUEST HOST: The debate over the next Supreme Court justice grinds on, as people try to divine where he stands on the key issues. People across the spectrum point to one case or another as proof positive of what John Roberts believes and how he would rule.But the evidence is all over the map. And to help us find our way is David Leitch, former deputy White House counsel who worked with Roberts, both at firm of Hogan & Hartson and at the Justice Department in the early 1990s. He joins us from Detroit.David, thanks for joining us.DAVID LEITCH, FORMER WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY COUNSEL: Glad to be here.ANGLE: Let me ask you first, Roberts' career is filled with interesting work on a broad range of cases. Some people will look at one case or another and say, ""That is a clear indication of what he believes."" Why shouldn't that be the case?LEITCH: Well, throughout John Roberts' career, like most lawyers, he represented clients. And clients brought him cases that were all over the map politically and in terms of the jurisprudence that they presented. And John was engaged in the practice of law and representing clients' interests.So it's a little difficult to tell from cases that one has in private practice what one's personal beliefs are. In fact, if you look at the cases that Judge Roberts handled in private practice, they would be hard -- you would be hard-pressed to draw a conclusion from them, because they were, on various sides of many issues, as his client's interests demanded.ANGLE: Now, most of the criticism has been from those who fear that he might be too conservative. But there is some information, some evidence that goes the other way. And there, there's a lot of talk now about a case from Colorado involving gay discrimination.What was that case? And what was John Roberts' role in it?LEITCH: Well, the case involved a statute that Colorado had passed that some viewed as discriminating against gays, and it was challenged and ultimately struck down by the Supreme Court.Judge Roberts' role, when he was in private practice, was a role that he had played hundreds of times in other cases, and that was namely to engage very briefly, in a moot court exercise, to help the advocate who was going to be standing in front of the Supreme Court argue a case...ANGLE: Now, this was pro bono work, right? This was work he was doing for free just to help out?LEITCH: Yes. And I think he spent about 6 1/2 hours on this particular case. And in private practice, in a law firm, it's in the best tradition of the bar; it's in the best tradition of being a law partner, to assist those who are arguing cases in the Supreme Court, if you're an expert in that.And John was asked to do that hundreds of time and he never said no. He always was willing to help. And it also really was a service to the Supreme Court, because it increased the quality of advocacy before the court.And everyone who has practiced in the court has seen cases that could use that kind of help. And it's been an important development over the years that attorneys in the practice before the Supreme Court have come to help others.John assisted the National Association of Attorneys General and other groups who wanted to increase the quality of advocacy in the court. And so this was just part of that kind of effort. I think it's in the best interests of the bar, and I think he should be commended for having spent so much of his time on these types of efforts.ANGLE: Now, that gay discrimination case is causing a little bit of angst on the right. Why shouldn't people have some doubts about his involvement in that case, if this is a big issue for them?LEITCH: Well, I think, because Judge Roberts made it a practice to help all comers and really to help them in the quality of their advocacy, and it was not a choice that he made in the sense that he was out there crusading for one case or another.ANGLE: OK.LEITCH: He was a professional who was trying to assist people in their professional activity in front of the court. And as I said, he did this hundreds of time and I don't think ever said no to anyone who came and asked them for this kind of brief assistance. He spent about 6 1/2 hours on the case and really ought to be commended for it.ANGLE: Now, on the other side, abortion rights organizations are pretty sure they know where he stands on abortion, though others say it's not at all clear. They point to a case dealing with Operation Rescue, which tries to prevent people from going into abortion clinics, on behalf of the first Bush administration that he filed an amicus, or friend of the court brief on that. Let's hear what one of the groups has to say about that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NANCY KEENAN, NARAL PRESIDENT: He wrote an amicus in Bray that defended Operation Rescue. And we find that of grave concern when you have somebody that didn't have to file that amicus, but did in defending Operation Rescue, which really are domestic terrorists.(END VIDEO CLIP)ANGLE: OK, so the view there is that he sided with domestic terrorists when he didn't have to. What's your view of that case?LEITCH: Well, again, that was a case in which Judge Roberts had a client. His client was the United States. And the position of the United States through the Bush administration was the one that was stated in the brief. He was working on behalf of the Bush administration.And I think it's a little much to say he was siding with domestic terrorists. There were significant legal issues in the case that was near the line of First Amendment activity. And it was very important that that be clarified. The Bush administration took a position that John helped articulate, along with other lawyers in the Justice Department.ANGLE: The question was how you regulate First Amendment rights without infringing on them, I gather?LEITCH: That's right. And you may recall that this was quite an unsettled question at the time that Operation Rescue and others were engaged in some activities that seemed to be over the line, but some activities that were closer to the line that judges had prevented them from doing.And, you know, we all want to protect First Amendment rights without having them become too extreme. And that was a case that helped to define the territory there. And again, Judge Roberts was representing the interests of the client, the United States, and the position of the Bush administration. I'm sure he did so admirably.ANGLE: OK, David Leitch, thanks so much for joining us. We appreciate it.LEITCH: Thank you.Content and Programming Copyright 2005 Fox News Network, L.L.C.

Obama's Playing 'Dumb Politics,' His Whole Act Has Worn a Little Thin	"This is a rush transcript from ""On the Record,"" September 29, 2011. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: All right, tonight: Better hold on because there are more twists, turns and upside-downs than a roller-coaster! Now it's Mr. Herman Cain. Two weeks ago, he was almost a asterisk in the GOP nomination race, and right now, Governor Perry and Governor Romney, you better look out because Herman Cain is surging and could put both of you in his rearview mirror! But of course, even that can change. Politics are so full of surprises.Former adviser to President Bush Karl Rove is here to go ""On the Record.""Good evening, Karl. And boy, what a difference this week. Herman Cain is surging, a lot of enthusiasm. Why?KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR/FORMER BUSH SENIOR ADVISER: He had a good debate performance and he won the Florida straw poll, and it gave him some attention and notoriety. We should be very careful about reading too much into these polls. There's are two stories in the Fox poll. One is Herman Cain has moved up. The other story is Rick Perry has moved down. And we shouldn't be reading too much into either one of them.This race is going to go back and forth and up and down until people get ready to vote. People are looking at this contest in a different way. They're judging it almost like they would, you know, an Olympic diving contest, rather than the normal presidential contest, where they pick somebody, stay with them and if they make a mistake, they give them an excuse. And you know, in this race, it's being treated a lot differently.VAN SUSTEREN: Well, but it certainly does seem that he's getting a lot of enthusiasm, Herman Cain. I don't think he's going to necessarily be the nominee. I don't know what his numbers are going to be tomorrow. But I certainly have got enough of a sense reading newspapers across the country and talking to people that he has connected, at least for the moment.Meanwhile, you mentioned Governor Rick Perry. He has two huge problems. He had that horrible comment to many Republicans about having heart with illegal immigration. Plus he has the -- the opt out part of the vaccine. So that was -- gave him some trouble. So he certainly has hit, you know, some rough spots.ROVE: Yes. I frankly think, almost more than any specific thing that he said, was the way that the third debate, the expectations were -- you know, the first debate was OK. Second debate, the expectations were that he should improve, and he didn't. The expectations on the third debate was that he needed to improve, and he got much worse. He had two or three very dreadful answers.So rather than even a specific comment -- and I do think the immigration comment hurt him -- I think it was actually the sort of the tone and how well he handled questions. And again, that's the bad news.There's also some good news in this. Again, I go back to the analogy of, this is like an Olympic diving trial, and we all are watching these things in a different way than we normally watch them. And we flip up the scorecards at the end of each debate and rate each one of one. And it is possible that -- entirely possible for governor Perry to come back.He will need to have a very good set of debate performances in October. He can't have a so-so debate and a good debate. He's got to have two really good debates. And he also has to show a good fund-raising number here on October 15th.And look, he comes from a big state. He's raised a lot of money for his governor's races, a lot of money for the Republican Governors Association. He'll probably be able to post a pretty good number.VAN SUSTEREN: But isn't it significant -- I mean, in spite of the fact that I realize how different each day can be in this political season -- is it not significant that Mr. Herman Cain, who doesn't have the huge money, doesn't have the huge machine, and has -- and he won the Florida straw poll, and he's getting a lot of the attention by people, and at least for the moment, he seems to connect with the voters and at least some people might -- some people might appreciate his 9-9-9 as being a very sort of simplified way of looking at taxes, which is something that really rubs a lot of Republicans the wrong way.ROVE: Yes. Look, this -- you touched on the good points. Again, though, I would make the point that until we start seeing him moving in these early states, like Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and we see some durability for this -- remember, we went -- we've been through this exercise a couple of times already this season. We had the -- Michele Bachmann won the Iowa straw poll and jumped in the polls, and now has dwindled away. We had Governor Perry come in and jump to a commanding lead, and now in the FOX poll, he's fallen back into second place.I suspect we're likely to see the same thing for Herman Cain because he had a really good debate performance, won the Florida straw polls, and then it'll be three weeks until the next -- between the Florida straw poll and the next debate. And during that time, we'll turn our attention to two different things. One is what everybody reports in terms of money. That's going to be a measure of how well they're doing.And second of all, whether or not anybody gives a substantive policy speech between now and the next debate that draws attention. Otherwise, it's going to be the humdrum, the back-and-forth of the day to day, and the only way that Herman Cain can affect his numbers there is to make a mistake, which I'm sure he's not going to make.VAN SUSTEREN: All right, so meanwhile, while the attention is on what some people say is the bad performance by Governor Perry and the surge by Mr. Herman Cain, there's the -- it seems like one of the people that sort of has avoided some of the noise is Governor Romney. But then today, Jay Carney, White House press secretary, sort of embraced him on this whole idea of the mandate, and he was quoted -- he says that he was even quoting Governor Romney as saying the mandate was a, quote, ""conservative"" idea. At what point, if at any point, does this health care in Massachusetts, or his statements about it being a conservative idea, this mandate -- do those statements ever come back to haunt him in the primary season?ROVE: Well, look, the president has already said this any number of times. In fact, as recently as the bus trip last month, the president was saying, All we did in Washington is what they did in Massachusetts.Look, Governor Romney has a choice. He gets to either have a debate with President Obama about how his plan is different than President Obama's, or he gets to have a debate with fellow Republicans over the issue. If I were him, I'd be having the debate with President Obama.Now, he started to say -- to have that debate earlier month when he was on with South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint. And he said a little bit, I think, in the third debate, where he started to describe some of the differences between Massachusetts and Washington. But it's a debate that is better for him to have sooner, rather than later. And it's better for him to have the debate with President Obama than it is to have a debate with eight Republicans on a stage in some debate somewhere.VAN SUSTEREN: All right, you raised President Obama's name. And today in your op-ed piece, it looks like you gave him a little advice on how he can run and -- or how he can win reelection. One of them is to offer a positive, uplifting vision. That was the strategy of 2008, according to your op-ed. The other choice was to feed the Democratic base red meat. Do you want explain that?ROVE: Well, first of all, I'm not giving him advice. If I was giving him advice, he wouldn't be listening to it anyway. I'm just describing...VAN SUSTEREN: I was teasing.ROVE: ... for people who are interested in watching the contest -- yes, I got that. But I want to be clear because otherwise, I'll get some e-mails, as I've already gotten, from people who say, Why are you giving President Obama advice? Well, I'm just commenting on the options available to him.I think the wiser course for him would have been to say, What is it that I need to lay out in the way of a positive agenda that allows me both to stoke the enthusiasm of Democrats, and more importantly, reach out to the swing voters who are upset with me and are up for grabs in this election?President Obama is playing dumb politics. He has made the -- he's made the assumption, he's operating on the assumption, that his principal problem is with Democrats. Uh-uh! His principal problem is with people like young voters, whose approval rating has dropped 30 points with him. It's with independent and college-educated voters. It's with women. It's with Latinos.Those five groups have moved away from the president by big margins since the time that he got inaugurated, and they were all -- all critical to his election in 2008. And the kind of things that he's doing now with class warfare and attacks on the Republicans, and these ridiculous strawman arguments, like when he said the Republicans, all they want to do is close down the government, return everybody's money, end the regulation, and tell everybody they're on their own, and that's not the way of America. I haven't heard a single Republican say that, but the president goes out there and says it!In San Jose, he went out and said, Well, the Republicans would cripple America. That kind of rhetoric turns off the independents and the college- educated voters and young people and Latinos and women who are so critical to his election victory. And he's doing this because he thinks he's got a deep, enduring problem with Democrats. He really doesn't.Take a look at this. In a matchup with Governor Romney, today Barack Obama carries 88 percent of Democrats -- 85 percent of Democrats. And against Governor Perry, 88 percent of Democrats. Now, he can do better, but not a whole heck of a lot better. Those are pretty good numbers for where we find ourselves at this point in the race.And if I were him, I wouldn't be worried about those people. He can get them back easily. I'd be worried about the swing voters. And instead, he's adopting language and tactics and an approach that are going to turn them off!VAN SUSTEREN: Well, then, why in your op-ed does it say he should feed the Democratic base? Because I would think he would just do the opposite. Sounds like they're locked in. If -- if I were...ROVE: No, no. No.VAN SUSTEREN: ... President Obama, I would -- go ahead.ROVE: Yes, no, I didn't say he should feed them. I said he's got two strategies. One is a positive and optimistic vision which would have the effect of reenergizing the Democrats and allowing him to go after the swing voters, or the other strategy, which he's adopted, which is feed the red meat to the Democratic donors and the Moveon.org kind of people, and that kind stuff -- he'll -- he'll marginally reenergize them, but he will do so by leaving an impression about, you know, being class warfare and maybe over the top and angry rhetoric and divisive and not a uniter that will linger among the swing voters and will hurt him in his ability to bring them into his camp.It's like he's sort of like acting like, Look, I can say these outrageous things and it makes the left-wingers really happy, but all of the people who are up for grabs in the election who really voted for Republicans in '10 after voting for Democrats in '06 and '08, they aren't listening at all. They will never hear this stuff.Baloney! They're hearing it! They're listening to it, and they'll remember it and it will make it that much more difficult for the president to pivot and somehow one day say, Oh, I'm a different guy than I've been for the last six or seven or eight months.Remember we had this with Al Gore. He was, like, angry Al Gore and then he was populist Al Gore and then he was conciliator Al Gore. People - - it damaged his credibility. The president is running the risk of doing the that here, and I think has actually done himself a grave risk by the pattern of the last six to eight weeks.VAN SUSTEREN: All right, any idea how big this swing voter group is, number one? And number two, what is their main issue?ROVE: Well, look, it depends on how you define it, but I think that the -- what we're talking about here is we are talking about potentially as much as a fifth or a quarter of the electorate, which is a big chunk, particularly when you talk about independent voters.And look, their issues are -- the interesting thing, if you look inside the data, their attitude -- what's concerning them is the economy, deficits, debt, spending, and the Affordable Care Act, and the tone in Washington. And in each of these -- each of the four policy instances, they look more like Republicans than they do Democrats.And the tone, they hold the president responsible. He's the president who led them to believe he would not be the president of red states or blue states, but of the United States. And this angry class warfare tone is much at odds with what he was doing in 2008.VAN SUSTEREN: All right. In light of where the voters stand and the different policies of the different Republican candidates and the president -- the president has an enormous amount of money. It's expected he's going to have a lot of money going into this -- into the general campaign. Can you -- can you win with a big fat war chest? It can be so destructive to your opponent and so positive towards yourself that that money becomes so much more important than message?ROVE: Money allows you to convey message. And yes, that does matter. Look, for example, in North Carolina in 2008, President Obama outspent John McCain I think it was like a -- you know, better than 2 to 1. In Indiana, I think it was, like, 7 to 1. Virginia, better than 2 to 1. And as a result, he was able to carry these traditionally Republican states.The last time Indiana and Virginia voted for a Democrat for president, 1964. Last time North Carolina did so, 1976. And yet Obama had this huge cash advantage in the fall of 2008 that allowed him to just overwhelm the defenses of -- of John McCain.Now, money itself doesn't help -- doesn't do it all. You have to have a strong, good message, and he had a strong message then, which was, I'm going to be a different kind of candidate who's going to bring the country together, change the tone in Washington. I'm upset with the deficits of the Bush years. I'm going to cut taxes for everybody who makes less than $250,000 a year.And interestingly enough, the second most widely displayed ad of the Obama campaign in battleground states in the fall of 2008 was an ad that said, Government-run health care? Extreme -- exclamation point, close quote. He developed a different tone as a centrist than he has governed -- since he's governed from the far left.VAN SUSTEREN: All right, Governor Christie -- I actually believe he's not going run. He said no so many times. But it doesn't seem like the drama stops. Every newspaper -- every day you pick a newspaper and there'll be someone who says, Well, he still hasn't made up his mind. Do you want to get into this voodoo game? Is he going to run or not? And should he or shouldn't he?ROVE: Well, look, first of all, I don't know whether he's going to run or not because on the one hand, he said last night, Go look at Politico, they've got 1:53 of me saying I will never run. And then when he got that very heartfelt question from the woman, he said, you know, in essence, you know, You'd have to be insane not to be moved by that.So I mean, if he was going to say -- if he was going to definitively say, I'm not running, he could have said so easily. In fact, he had sounded like he did so with his Politico answer, Look at Politico, see what the -- see the tape of what I've said. So I think he's still thinking about it, but whether or not he runs, I don't know.He's got a very limited timeframe to jump in. Now, should he jump in? Look, that's up to him. If he does jump in, I think it jiggles the contest in interesting ways. And whether he wins or not, I think it ends up making the Republican candidates stronger. Ironically enough, the better -- the better the field at the top, the better the nominee becomes because he or she has to engage in a strong campaign over a sustained period of time. And you know, it's sort of like, you know, good things roll out. The right -- you know, the strongest person will rise to the top.But you know, I don't know whether he's going to run or not, but I think we'll know the answer pretty darn quick.VAN SUSTEREN: Well, I can't help but notice it's sort of mirror image of President Obama in terms of experience on issues like jobs. Neither one has had a history of creating jobs. And both of them are quite -- you know, they're inspiring to listen to them speak or -- and -- so I'm not -- I'm not so sure that they're so profoundly -- they have different politics, but in terms of what they present to the voters, there's an awful a lot of similarities.ROVE: Oh, I think there's a big difference in the way that they speak. Chris Christie speaks from the heart, not from the teleprompter, and he's a straight shooter. I mean, there's no artifice with this guy, which is why we're all...VAN SUSTEREN: I think I'm talking about the effect that's created...ROVE: ... confused because normally...VAN SUSTEREN: I think -- I think the effect that's created -- I mean, Republicans are dazzled by Governor Christie and Democrats are dazzled by President Obama.ROVE: Well, I think it was Democrats were dazzled by President Obama. I'm not certain -- I think that whole act has worn a little thin. But you're right, Republicans have seen him. He's become a folk hero. I mean, the Internet has made this -- and social media have made this in part possible because you can go to the YouTube and catch any one of the town hall meetings where he is confronted by union protesters or state government employees and he -- and he speaks, you know, passionately and straightforward from his heart about the taxpayers of New Jersey and what they deserve to have as part of the policy debate.So you know, I think you're right that he is -- Christie's style has won him a lot -- won him a lot of admiration.VAN SUSTEREN: Karl, nice to see you. Thank you, sir.ROVE: You bet, Greta. Thank you."	['Obama', 'Perry', 'Romney', 'Christie', 'McCain']	[]

The pope's America tour continued today, Pope Francis addressing a joint meeting of Congress and got very political. He talked about climate change, immigration, the refugee crisis, arms trading and much more.Joining me now with reaction, Fox news contributors Dr. Robert Jeffress and Father Jonathan Morris.FATHER JONATHAN MORRIS, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, Sean.HANNITY: OK, I was raised Catholic, went to a seminary. I was an altar boy. You didn't know that, did you.MORRIS: No.HANNITY: No. See? All right...MORRIS: I knew you went to high school seminary.HANNITY: He's liberal on immigration. He's liberal on the refugee crisis. He's liberal on climate change. He's liberal, and I would argue in a very kind, gentle way, naive on arms trading and nuclear weapons. And this whole economic justice thing that he buys into -- I just see him as so wrong on those issues!MORRIS: Sean, what good lefty do you know who says, I promise you, I'm not a lefty? Usually, they're very proud of it. On the plane from Cuba to the United States, he said, I assure you, I'm not a lefty. Maybe in Spanish...HANNITY: Well, on abortion?MORRIS: Exactly.HANNITY: He's -- he's...MORRIS: In other words, he might be a -- if he's a liberal, as you suggest -- and I can understand where you're coming from -- he would be a very bad one. He is pro-life. In Cuba, Sean, he told the women there gathered around him, Take your hands and put them on your stomach and protect the unborn!HANNITY: Why didn't he tell Castro...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: ... go after him for being a murderer and releasing political prisoners?MORRIS: Well, first of all, 3,000 prisoners by the force and the diplomacy of the Vatican were released before he even arrived onto Cuban soil. Then he spent 45 minutes with Fidel. My guess is he got an earful, as well as Raul.HANNITY: You think so?MORRIS: Yes. He also talked about what family life is...HANNITY: How does he not understand...MORRIS: ... in the United States of America and what it should be.HANNITY: How does he not understand? We lost well over 100 million human souls in the last century, but it was American arms that stopped Nazism, communism, fascism! We paid that price!MORRIS: Sean, what was the first phrase he said today to Congress?HANNITY: About freedom and...MORRIS: No, he said...HANNITY: ""The land of the free and home of the brave.""MORRIS: He said -- he said, ""The land of the free, the home of the brave."" I think he's learning -- he's never been to the United States. I think he is coming to appreciate and to love what the United States of America is!HANNITY: But does he not understand when he talks about the refugee crisis or immigration, we have 94 million Americans not working, 50 million in poverty! We don't have room for all the world's immigrants that want to come in here! And on the refugees -- we have an intelligence community telling us that -- that ISIS will infiltrate the refugee community, and that puts us at risk!MORRIS: I get it. Sean, he walks the walk, and that's why people love him. In fact, in reference to the immigration, Sean...HANNITY: All right, I sound like a big critic. I'm not.MORRIS: But what did he say -- you are, and that's OK. You don't have to like the pope to be a good Catholic, to be a good Christian! You know, some...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: I agree more with your politics!MORRIS: Sean, he walks the walk in terms of these refugees. He told every church and convent and monastery in Europe -- not the United States, in Europe -- to take in a family. That's complicated!HANNITY: Take in a family of Syrian Muslims...MORRIS: Yes.HANNITY: ... that may be terrorists that infiltrated the refugee community?MORRIS: Yes. He invited people...HANNITY: Well, let him invite them into the Vatican!MORRIS: He invited people...HANNITY: Set up tents in Vatican Square!MORRIS: He already did! He already did!HANNITY: Oh, good grief.MORRIS: He said every single parish, run the risk of inviting in these families because they are desperate.HANNITY: Oh! I want to help them. We -- I -- Geraldo, of all people, Dr. Jeffress, had a great idea, and he said -- and I don't mean that against my friend, Geraldo, but he had a great idea. Have a Syrian refugee safe zone in Syria! And we can provide humanitarian assistance.What is your reaction, as an evangelical, to the pope's positions on immigration, the refugees, climate change, economic justice and arms trading?ROBERT JEFFRESS, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: Look, let me say very clearly I have great respect for Pope Francis. He's a humble Christ follower. We all can learn from him.And I think, Sean, whenever the pope is standing up and he's speaking about the right to life and the sanctity of marriage and religious freedom, all evangelicals are applauding because he's speaking from the authority of God's word.I do think when he starts talking about arms control and climate change, many say he's moving maybe more into the realm of personal opinion. But something I heard him say today I felt was key, and that's the word ""balance.""And I think, for example, we have to balance our concern for immigrants with the biblical role of government to protect its citizens.HANNITY: Yes, and by the way...JEFFRESS: We have to balance our belief for the sanctity of life with the very real belief that capital punishment is right! And this is key, Sean. We need to balance a concern for the environment, which is a biblical value, with the truth!HANNITY: We should be good stewards of God's gifts. And by the way...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: ... with a weapon, a slingshot and a rock that...MORRIS: Oh, come on, Sean. Sean, are you kidding me?HANNITY: Father...MORRIS: You're going to make a comparison between a rock and a nuclear arm?HANNITY: It was a good thing that David killed Goliath.MORRIS: Dr. Jeffress, help me!HANNITY: It was a good thing that David killed Goliath! That's right. I believe that. All right, let me ask you this...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Hang on. I want to get to another topic. We're running out of time. So OK, all right, 11 of the 12 Apostles were married, OK?MORRIS: We don't know that.HANNITY: OK, but anyway...MORRIS: We know St. Peter was. Yes, Peter was. Yes.HANNITY: Eleven of the twelve is my understanding.MORRIS: All right.HANNITY: We know that for the first thousand years...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: The first thousand years of the human (ph) church, priests were allowed to marry. So this wasn't a Jesus rule, this is a church rule. And I would argue...MORRIS: That's right. You're right. Absolutely.HANNITY: ... it was rooted in money. And my question is, with all the talk about, you know, the concern and narcissism and evils of money and social justice, don't you think the pool of candidates for priests would be so much better if the church would allow priests to marry?MORRIS: I agree.HANNITY: You agree with me.MORRIS: I agree that the pool of candidates would be much larger and there would be a -- many, many, many...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: ... a church rule.MORRIS: It is a church rule. It doesn't mean that the church rule is therefore unimportant or has no value. As Dr. Jeffress knows very well, as soon as you say, OK, your clergy can get married, it doesn't mean all of a sudden, you have no problems, OK? It doesn't mean -- it's...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: But isn't that a money decision because the church wanted to hang onto their money?MORRIS: You know what? I think there is a partly economic -- the fact that they -- the church, my parish, only has to pay me $25,000 a year, about, it's easier for the parish...HANNITY: I'll buy you...(CROSSTALK)MORRIS: ... in the Bronx. But there's also an imitation of Jesus himself, Jesus himself who chose not to get married. There's a value there.HANNITY: But we're not Jesus. Listen, I'm -- all have sinned and fallen short. Start with me. I'm guiltier than anybody. But...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Let me go to Robert Jeffress...MORRIS: What did St. Paul say? Dr. Jeffress can explain what St. Paul said.HANNITY: He said it's better to get married than to burn, something to that effect.MORRIS: But he also said -- he...JEFFRESS: That's right.HANNITY: Go ahead, Doctor.JEFFRESS: And Sean -- Sean, and of course, in Timothy 1:3, the Bible says that the pastor is to be the husband of one wife. So marriage is something to be celebrated.HANNITY: Amen.JEFFRESS: And I've got to say -- I've got to say this, and that is, with the differences we might have with Pope Francis on some of these secondary issues, I'm not going to quibble about that because here's the fact. As this world becomes increasingly darker, I find myself having much more in common with my Catholic friends than I even do with liberal Baptists because the fact is, we are fighting together...HANNITY: Well, you know what?JEFFRESS: ... against a common enemy, the kingdom of darkness!HANNITY: I just wish he would appeal to people's greater spiritual needs and stay out of the political realm. But I've got to run. Father, I guess I'm going to have to go to confession after this.MORRIS: No! It's OK to disagree with the pope!HANNITY: All right. I agree. But I don't know why, my Catholic guilt is kicking in.MORRIS: Oh, come on!HANNITY: All right, thank you.And coming up, a new Fox News poll reveals that a majority of you, the American people, think Hillary Clinton lied about her personal e-mail server. Is it possible she goes to jail? Ainsley Earhardt is here with a full report. We get reaction tonight from Governor Chris Christie.Also, Governor Mike Huckabee calls out President Obama on his faith of Christianity. He'll explain tonight. That and more as we continue.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)HANNITY: All right, that is Bruce Springsteen, of course, for Governor Christie, who's going to join us in a minute.Welcome back to ""Hannity."" Now, the scandal surrounding Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail server is now taking a very serious toll on the campaign as American voters now appear to have real concerns about the trustworthiness of the former secretary of state.Joining me now with a full report, at the ""Hannity"" big board...AINSLEY EARHARDT, CO-HOST, ""FOX & FRIENDS FIRST"": Hey, Sean!HANNITY: ... ""Fox & Friends First"" co-host -- needs no introduction - - Ainsley Earhardt. Hi.EARHARDT: You're sweet! Thank you, Sean. Great. Good to see you this morning, or tonight, I should say.There is more bad news for Hillary Clinton. A majority of the American people now believe the 2016 Democratic front-runner is not telling the truth about her personal server, this according to a brand-new Fox News poll, which shows 58 percent of Americans think that Clinton is lying about how her e-mails were handled during her time as secretary of state.These new numbers should come as no surprise, but most accounts -- by most accounts, Clinton's handling of this scandal over the past several months has been muddled and sometimes just downright contradictory. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: The laws and regulations in effect when I was secretary of state allowed me to use my e-mail for work. That is undisputed.It clearly wasn't the best choice. And I take responsibility for that decision.I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal e-mails instead of two.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: IPhone or Android?(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: IPhone. OK, in full disclosure...UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Blackberry.CLINTON: ... and a blackberry.I have a -- you know, an iPad, a mini-iPad, an iPhone and a Blackberry.I believe I have met all of my responsibilities, and the server will remain private.In order to be as cooperative as possible, we have turned over the server. They can do whatever they want to with the server to figure out what's there and what's not there.(END VIDEO CLIP)EARHARDT: And Sean, there could be even more bad news for Hillary. As you reported yesterday, the FBI has allegedly recovered many of the deleted e-mails from her private server.Back to you, Sean.HANNITY: All right, Ainsley, thank you so much.Joining me now, more reaction, 2016 Republican presidential candidate -- he's taken a jump up in the polls -- Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey. Governor, good to see you. How are you?GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, R-N.J., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Good to be back, Sean.HANNITY: If 58 percent of the American people think you're a liar, can you win? Can you be president?CHRISTIE: That's very difficult, very difficult. And you know, the problem for her now is that that's going to be the least of her problems. She's going to be looking back on bad polls as the good old days. You know, I think she's going to have some real serious issues regarding prosecution potential here.HANNITY: All right, let me go through some of this. There are three laws, including two felonies, that Hillary may have broken with regard to the personal server. We'll put them up there -- 18 USC 1924, knowingly removing materials containing classified information of the United States with the intent to retain, so on, and so forth. 18 USC 793, which is the transmitting or losing defense information, disclosure or classified information, 18 USC 798, and potential federal records keeping violations. You know, we have those laws, too.Rudy Giuliani has identified 13 statutes that she should be investigated for. You're a former prosecutor.CHRISTIE: Yes.HANNITY: What do you think?CHRISTIE: Well, listen, I think she's got big problems. You didn't mention obstruction of justice up there, which is also another potential problem and charge for her.And so the FBI's got a little work to do, and I hope they're getting to it because the American people have a right to know this beforehand.And what you showed in that video and Ainsley showed on the video is - - is just awful because she doesn't tell the truth. She's not transparent. She doesn't answer questions. She thinks she's above it all.You know, old (ph) Ed Henry asked her three questions one day. She said he was only entitled to get one. I'm sorry, your highness, there are actually rules and laws that apply to everybody in this country, including Queen Clinton!HANNITY: Yes, exactly. But when Ed Henry did ask that series of questions, he said, Did you wipe your server clean? You mean like with a cloth? I mean -- really?CHRISTIE: She's got obviously a juvenile joke writer who's writing her some jokes that they want to hope will make people forget.But what people understand about this problem is they want her to answer a few simple questions, Sean, right? First, why did you have a private e-mail server in your basement at all? Second, why were you using it for official business? Third, why would you ever have classified information running through it when the Russians, the Chinese or just two 18 year-olds off in a tube (ph) can hack into it? And why aren't you willing to answer these questions?HANNITY: In the bathroom of a mom and pop shop. Now, the FBI says they recovered a substantial number that -- she deleted 33,000 e-mails. Then she supposedly, in her mind, thought the server was wiped clean. That's what they told us.Now. of those 33,000, if they're not about yoga, Chelsea's wedding, her mother's funeral or e-mailing Bill, who doesn't e-mail...CHRISTIE: Right.HANNITY: ... is it going to be about Benghazi, the Clinton Foundation? Is it going to be classified information?CHRISTIE: It could be all of those things and more because we know she was conducting all of her business over that server.HANNITY: That means she would have obstructed justice, violate the Espionage Act, violate all these codes that I put up before. Is there a potential she gets indicted here?CHRISTIE: Well, sure. I mean, David Petraeus got charged.HANNITY: And this is far more severe and much...CHRISTIE: And she held a much higher position in our nation -- she held the number one cabinet position a president can give to anyone, secretary of state, handling the most sensitive information for diplomatic reasons.And the other part of the problem is the president knew about this!HANNITY: You...CHRISTIE: And why is he -- here's what I wonder, Sean. Why hasn't the president of the United States stood up?HANNITY: Ed Klein will be here on Monday. He wrote a book. He has an account where Hillary walked into the Oval Office, had a big fight with Barack Obama and said, Call your dogs off, Barack. And he said no. He said, I'm not going to do it. So -- but we'll get into that Monday.CHRISTIE: Yes.HANNITY: Let me ask you -- Hillary said it's not an emergency as it relates to entitlements. You have distinguished yourself as the one candidate that says we got to touch the third rail -- Social Security, entitlement spending, raise the eligibility age and means testing, which, by the way, I interpret as stealing my retirement money that I paid into since I was 12 years old, but that's a different issue. Is it an emergency?CHRISTIE: It is an emergency. You know, most recent private sector study says in seven to eight years, Social Security will be insolvent. If that's not an emergency for middle class families in this country -- and this is the problem with Mrs. Clinton...HANNITY: They stole the money already, is your argument back to me.CHRISTIE: Of course. Of course they stole the money. They lied to us and stole from us. They said it was in a trust fund. It was never in a trust fund. They're taking our payroll taxes today and spending it on other things and giving us IOUs in return.There's nothing in the lockbox, Sean, except a pile of IOUs from the federal government.HANNITY: They stole my money.CHRISTIE: They stole your money already. Mrs. Clinton -- you know what she wants to do? She wants to raise your taxes more so they can steal more of it!HANNITY: Let me ask you -- the Republicans have been weak and timid. And I'm not talking about the governors, I'm talking about congressional Republicans. They said they would repeal and replace ""Obama care,"" they wouldn't use the power of the purse. They ran in 2014. They said they'd stop executive amnesty. Now they've got the issue of Planned Parenthood.Now, should they fund the government completely, maybe even transfer the money that goes to Planned Parenthood, the $500 million, half a billion a year, to other women's health issues and pass that budget, and if the Democrats don't take it up in the Senate or president vetoes it, what should they do?CHRISTIE: Listen, they should -- we've done this, as you -- as we've talked about before. We've done this on the state level. We haven't funded Planned Parenthood for six years.They should send the bill to the president's desk and make him veto it, you know? And...HANNITY: If he vetoes it and they fund the rest of the government, what would you advise them to do then?CHRISTIE: Listen, I would take that money, one good idea, and you just mentioned, is take that money and put it on other women's health issues. If this is really a women's health issue, well, then, let's spend the money on women's health.HANNITY: (INAUDIBLE)CHRISTIE: And by the way, you know, we know that Planned Parenthood...HANNITY: But they need to take a stand. Don't they need to...CHRISTIE: Of course they do.HANNITY: Because they surrender every time!CHRISTIE: We are tired of -- listen, we're tired of the shell game, OK? They told us in 2010, Give us a Republican House, we'll really make noise. Then they say, Well, no, no, no, we need -- 2014, we need to have the Senate. Then we give them the Senate. Now they're saying, No, we really need 60 votes!HANNITY: Frustrating.CHRISTIE: The American people are tired of it!HANNITY: Last question. Does Hillary go to jail?CHRISTIE: Listen, I think she stands a real chance of being prosecuted. And then it's anybody's ball game. Nobody likes to be on the wrong side of the V...HANNITY: No way.CHRISTIE: ... as they say...HANNITY: Yes, true.CHRISTIE: ... with the United States of America on the right side of the V (ph). And she's got problems that David Petraeus had to confront and Sandy Berger had to confront. She's not above the law!HANNITY: Sandy Berger, you mean when he was sloppy and stuck the documents in his pants?CHRISTIE: That's exactly what I was talking about!HANNITY: In his underpants?CHRISTIE: Yes! Yes!(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: It was sloppy, but it also got him in trouble with the law.HANNITY: It's also called stealing...(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: And she's not above the law!HANNITY: Yes.CHRISTIE: And the fact is, she thinks she can -- she doesn't have to answer questions. She's not accountable to the American people. Anybody wants to be president of the United States, you better be accountable to the American people!HANNITY: All right, Governor Christie, good to see you. Thank you.CHRISTIE: Nice to be back.HANNITY: Coming up next tonight right here on ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE HUCKABEE, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If a person says I'm a Christian but you invite the pope into your home, and then you invite a whole bunch of people who are at odds with the Catholic church policy, I think there's something very unseemly about that.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Governor Mike Huckabee questions -- calls into question the president's Christianity. He will explain next.Also, as refugees continue to pour out of the Middle East, can anything be done to stop them from coming to our shores, especially since our intelligence community says that ISIS will infiltrate the refugee community? One Republican congressman wants to know how much this will cost us and how dangerous it is. We also get reaction from Senator Rand Paul.Also tonight, actor Tim Allen is here. We'll find out his political favorite candidate straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)HUCKABEE: I'm less concerned about what faith a person has. I'm more concerned about the authenticity of their faith and how that plays out in their policies.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I also...HUCKABEE: I'm also concerned about a guy that believe he's a Christian and pretends to be and says he is, but then does things that makes it very difficult for people to practice their Christian faith.I'm disappointed if a person says, I'm a Christian but you invite the pope into your home and then you invite a whole bunch of people who are at odds with the Catholic church policy -- I think there's something very unseemly about that.(END AUDIO CLIP)HANNITY: All right, that was Governor Mike Huckabee earlier this week calling out President Obama. He joins us now, 2016 presidential candidate, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee.Governor, when you say, I'm more concerned about the6 authenticity of their faith and how it plays out in their policies and that he pretends to be, you know, a guy than believes he's a Christian and pretends and says he is but does things that make it difficult for people to practice their Christian faith -- explain that in more detail. You say he's pretending to be a Christian?HUCKABEE: Well, what I mean by that, Sean, is here's a person who says he's a Christian. All right, let's take him at face value. Let's just say that that's correct. But what kind of Christian? What kind of Christian goes after the Little Sisters of the Poor? What kind of Christian goes after a wonderful evangelical family like the Green family at Hobby Lobby, who provide very generous salary and benefits for their employees, but they don't want to provide abortifacient drugs?And what kind of administration won't stand up for an elected county clerk like Kim Davis, but will also at the same time make concessions for Nidal Hasan, the Ft. Hood shooter, or for the detainees at Gitmo? I just wonder, when is this president going to show some love...HANNITY: Well, I have another question. If you don't mind, I'll add to your list. Who sits in the pews of Jeremiah ""GD America"" and ""America's chickens have come home to roost"" after 9/11? Is that a Christian church to you? He says he's a Christian. It's...HUCKABEE: I'll tell you this, Sean...HANNITY: I wouldn't go -- I'm a Christian. I wouldn't go to Reverend Wright's church.HUCKABEE: You know, I sit in church every Sunday. If my pastor said stuff like that, I'd go to a different church because it's not something that I find as part of the Christian message to condemn a country that has done more to provide really a platform of generosity across the world.This country has always been the country that responded in the most Christian of ways by being the epitome of kindness and relief.I remember after the great earthquakes in Pakistan, I was there, and there were thousands and thousands of people who were left homeless. You know who I saw feeding them, clothing them, providing shelter for them? I saw Americans there. I didn't see many Europeans. I didn't see many Asians. Not anything against them, but I'm telling you it's the Americans who show up after the tsunamis and after the floods.And every now and then, I think it'd be nice just to hear the president affirm Americans and specifically Christians in America who go across the world helping the helpless.HANNITY: All right, let me play some comments because the president has made a lot of comments about Islam and some comments about Christianity. Let me play some of the highlights, and I want you to interpret this for us.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Remember that during the Crusades, the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ. Slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ.On Easter, I do reflect on the fact that as a Christian, I am supposed to love. And I have to say that sometimes, when I listen to less than loving expressions by Christians, I get concerned.The United States is not and will never be at war with Islam.Islam is not part of the problem in combating violent extremism. It is an important part of promoting peace.Our enemies respect no religious freedom. Al Qaeda's cause is not Islam.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: What is your reaction? He seems to bend over backwards. He won't even mention the words ""radical Islam,"" but then he talks about the terrible deeds committed in the name of Christ or slavery and Jim Crow all too often justified in the name of Christ? That's not my reading of history.Maybe some extremist groups, but I know many Christians were part of the movement to free the slaves and part of the Underground Railroad movement in this country, Governor!HUCKABEE: Well, and let's remember that the Civil Rights movement was rooted in the church.HANNITY: That's, too. That's right.HUCKABEE: If it were not for the preachers in the South, Martin Luther King and the many pastors who in many cases put their lives on the line -- the whole Civil Rights movement came right out of the churches.Were there some people who stood in the way and that were church people? Of course there was. But go across this land. Look at the great universities. They were started as Christian institutions, including schools like Harvard and Yale. They were started to train ministers and the preaching of the gospel. Take a look at the hospitals, Catholic hospitals, Presbyterian hospitals, Baptist hospitals.HANNITY: But how do you interpret...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: ... his comments about Islam versus his comments about Christianity. He bends over backwards to praise Islam, never say ""radical Islam,"" then he seems to bend over backwards to talk about the terrible deeds in the name of Christ and talk about the Crusades, which he clearly knows nothing about, but that's a side issue.HUCKABEE: Well, and one of the clips that you played, where he said that we're not at war with Islam -- we may not be at war with Islam, we are at war with radical Islamic terrorists...HANNITY: They're at war with us.HUCKABEE: ... and they are fighting in the name of Islam. And to deny that, Sean, is to deny reality. And I just don't think you can defeat an enemy if you're not willing to call the enemy out for who he is and why he's doing what he's doing.The people are doing it because they want to establish a religious caliphate.HANNITY: Yes.HUCKABEE: They're not doing this just because they want a piece of real estate or like the color of their flag better. They are doing it because they believe that the God that they serve wants them to kill us. Now that's being done in the name of their religion. Like it or not, President Obama, that's why they're doing it.HANNITY: All right, Governor, well said. Appreciate you being with us. Thank you.And coming up, one Republican lawmaker is calling for the U.S. to put a hold on accepting refugees until we find out how much it's going to cost you, the American people. Also, how dangerous is it knowing that ISIS will infiltrate the refugee population? He's here along with Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.Also later tonight, comedian, actor Tim Allen is here to talk about the brand new season of his hit TV show ""Last Man Standing."" And, by the way, who does he support for 2016? Straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" So with refugees from the Middle East pouring into Europe, many politicians are now calling on America to help by allowing an increased number of migrants right here into the U.S. But amid security concerns, one U.S. Congressman has introduced legislation that would halt the intake of new refugees until America's migrant resettlement program is fully audited and the security risks have been assessed.Here now to discuss his new legislation, Texas Congressman Brian Babin is with us. Well, James Clapper, the head -- the national intelligence head and our state department have both said the same thing, that ISIS and Al Qaeda will both infiltrate the refugee population. So doesn't that mean that the risk is there and we can't ascertain whether they are a genuine refugee or an ISIS fighter?REP. BRIAN BABIN, R-TEXAS: That's exactly right, Sean. There's no way to vet or screen these people coming out of the Middle East. And all we have to do is look at western Europe and the failures of their refugee program. Then looking at ours, we've already taken 500,000 refugees in the last six years of President Obama's administration. And less than five percent of those have been the most persecuted group of all, and that's Christians.And so I think it's high time that we look at this with an $18.6 trillion national debt, what this is going to cost us. And 90 percent of these refugees are going to be on federal welfare programs. And then we look at see exactly what is happening from a national security standpoint, it's a disaster. We've going to invite the problems and turmoil of the Middle East inside the United States. And this is just an open door for ISIS to establish bases of operation at taxpayer expense and legally.HANNITY: Can you stop it? Can you stop it?BABIN: Well, I'm working as hard as I can, Sean, to make sure that this Bill does come to the floor, get voted on. I can't predict what the president will or will not do. All I know is I have a sworn duty. My oath of office was to protect the citizens of the United States and our national security. And that's what I intend to do.HANNITY: All right, good for you, congressman. We'll follow the issue closely. I don't think we should take one. If they are a risk to American security and our homeland security, we shouldn't take one of them. Thank you, sir.BABIN: I'm with you. Thank you, Sean.HANNITY: Joining us now with more is 2016 presidential candidate Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. Senator, we know in Germany, German officials said at least 25 percent of the refugees flooding Germany are lying about even being from Syria. We know in Hungary migrants were rioting throwing rocks at police shouting ""Allahu Akbar."" And we know in Croatia Muslim refugees set up camp at a Christian cemetery and they trashed the place. James Clapper says it is almost a certainty ISIS will infiltrate. Why should we take one of these people?RAND PAUL, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know, this is one of the reasons I opposed Rubio's bill originally on immigration, because I didn't think there is enough scrutiny for those who might come and attack us. In the little town I live in this Kentucky, two refugees came from Iraq, and they tried to buy stinger missiles to attack us with. So, yes, the refugee program has needed more scrutiny for a long time. So does the student visa program.That doesn't mean I'm completely against it, but, for goodness sakes, we need to know who's coming. One of the refugees that was flooding into Europe the other day, they had only his name and that he was from Afghanistan. And, my goodness, what are the odds that he might be somebody who is going to attack the west? You need to know more about someone than just their name. He had no passport and he was 19 years old. So yes, absolutely we need more scrutiny.HANNITY: The prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, met with Vladimir Putin and they agreed to cooperate in terms of airstrikes against some of the militants and ISIS fighters in Syria, which I think is a good idea. Believe it or not, Geraldo Rivera had an even better idea. Why not the United States and Russia and all the other countries that are helping set up a safe zone area within Syria that they would defend the refugee population? And then we could offer humanitarian assistance, et cetera.PAUL: I've got a better idea. Why don't we set it up in Saudi Arabia? It annoys me to death the Saudi Arabians that were primarily responsible for 9/11, they're not doing anything. They keep pouring arms into the Syrian civil war. It is like throwing gasoline on a fire. And then the Saudi Arabians do nothing to clean up the mess. They've always played both sides.HANNITY: Why hasn't Egypt, Jordan, and the Saudis absorbed the Palestinian population over the years? The real answer is they don't want them. Isn't that true?PAUL: Frankly, Iran, why doesn't Iran step up? The president seems to have a conversation with Iran. Why doesn't he ask Iran to take the Shiite Muslims that are fleeing? Why doesn't Saudi Arabia take the Sunni Muslims that are fleeing? Because, frankly, they're part of a problem but they never step up to be part of the solution.HANNITY: But also isn't it true they don't want them because they view this as a problem for their countries, so --PAUL: Yes. But the next time Saudi Arabia comes asking for weapons, this needs to be the question. If Saudi Arabia's not going to be -- you saw what Saudi Arabia offered to do. They offered to build more mosques in Germany. I don't think that's necessarily the solution. Saudi Arabia gave hundreds of tons of weapons indiscriminately into the Syrian civil war. Many of the weapons that ISIS has now came from Saudi Arabia. So I do think Saudi Arabia is part of the problem and someone needs to talk about it. And before we have refugees coming to America, I want to know why Saudi Arabia who you ostensibly is our ally, why they aren't willing to take any refugees. That question should be directly asked of Saudi Arabia.HANNITY: All right, well said, good idea. Thank you, senator, appreciate it.Coming up, actor Tim Allen here to talk about his upcoming season of ""The Last Man Standing."" Plus we'll ask him to weigh in on the 2016 presidential race and more as we continue tonight here on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" Tim Allen is one of Hollywood's biggest stars, and his hit show ""Last Man Standing"" returns for now its fifth season on ABC tomorrow night. Allen's character Mike Baxter is a self-described man's man. He's not afraid to tell it like it is on everything, including politics. Here's a clip of Allen's character doing a video blog.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Human beings are blessed with reason, but it's harder to use it when the media bombards you with terrifying images - tsunamis, plane crashes, the new Colonel Sanders. That's why I'm declaring Outdoor Man a fear-free zone, because we don't sell fear. We sell courage. We sell engagement between man and nature in the form of kayaks, climbing gear, and on sale this month, casting rods. You see, the world is kind of the opposite of Hillary Clinton. It actually gets less scary the better you know it.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Here now with more, actor Tim Allen. How are you, sir?TIM ALLEN, ACTOR ""LAST MAN STANDING"": You know, Sean, I'm good. I got a question really quick for you. Who are you throwing that football to, and what's your football team?HANNITY: My football team, Jets and Giants in that order. And I'm throwing it to whoever is available on any given day and night, usually my assistant. Like last night our stage manager's daughter was here so we threw it to Wendy who is a rock star. And she's seven years old. She caught every ball, didn't miss one.ALLEN: That's what I watched.HANNITY: So I've seen the show. I look at the character, Mike Baxter. He's a conservative dad. He's got a conservative blog, a web blog. He just trashed Hillary Clinton a little bit, took a nice shot at her in that clip. I'm thinking how real is -- how close to Tim Allen is Mike Baxter?ALLEN: Well, I'm what they call fiscal conservative. I like problem solving. Problem solving usually originates for my family, there's nine kids, and my single mom for a while. And a lot of it was about how are we going to pay for this? My family's all about that. How you going to pay for it, any idea?In my neighborhood in north Hollywood, we wanted to get trees put in. Here in communist California it is difficult because there are so many regulations. But you can get stuff done, we planted trees, got our street cleaned up. And our councilman, he was the guy that did it. And we worked with him, figured out how to work with Paul Krekorian. Paul Krekorian is our councilman, and I worked with this guy. And when you work -- Tim Allen tends to be a problem solver. I said I like problem solving, period, whoever it works with.But if you don't know -- I don't know who said it, we went to a fundraiser, took my mom to see a fundraiser. She wanted to see a fundraiser, happened to be a Democratic fundraiser. Because I'm a comedian I get invited to these things. Somebody at the fundraiser, I won't name names, said there is a way we can spend our way out of debt.HANNITY: Think about that. Spend our way out of debt. OK. If that's the case we'd be the richest country and we'd have no debt at all now. We're spending a lot of money.It's funny -- go ahead.ALLEN: I'm not a version of that. I work Las Vegas at the Mirage. Las Vegas is the only place that uses that to their advantage. You can spend your way out of debt, that's what they count on. One thing Vegas does is they make a promise, they keep a promise. If they owe you money, they owe you money. This government every now and then, as you well know, says, we really didn't expect to you need that money. And that's where -- I think you came up with this penny rule or this dollar rule? You take a dollar off every program?HANNITY: The penny plan. You take a penny out of every dollar. It's really simple. I don't understand why one candidate doesn't adopt this. You stop baseline budgeting, which is the built increases of eight percent a year which is growing government to the point we have $20 trillion in debt, 120 in unfunded liabilities. You take one penny out of every dollar every year for six years, you balance your budget. Simple, right?ALLEN: It makes so much sense. Mike Baxter's character is a lot of me. What is genius about ""Last Man Standing"" is we have a liberal bent group that writes this, and no one makes fun of liberals better than liberals when they're on their game. And they're not many conservatives in this group that write. But what we like to do is have fun with it. This is a graduate from the University of Michigan, yes, yes. And he has an intelligence, so we designed him like a very smart Archie Bunker. I want to say provocative things, but it's a family. And I have all daughters. In one episode I was a very machismo guy, I don't want women playing on softball teams, I don't want women doing this, but don't tell my daughters they can't do it. So the guy has this conflicted background.HANNITY: Can you imagine if we had a real Archie Bunker on TV? ""All in the Family"" was a great show. We're so nauseatingly politically correct now we couldn't have an Archie Bunker today. People would flip and lose their minds.ALLEN: You're singing to the choir. For a while I get notes that Mike Baxter, he would get mad he would call Obama a communist. We got Facebook both sides of that. And eventually they said that you have to calm that down. You can't call the president a communist. You know, we deal with -- China is a brother in economic growth and they are a communist country. It doesn't mean what it used to mean. That being said, I do push the button a little bit too hard sometimes.HANNITY: No. Listen, I always thought you're funny. I love all these Hollywood people I've met over the years. They whisper to me, don't tell anyone. I'm a conservative. I agree with you. I'm like, why are you afraid to mention that? I don't want to hurt my career. I'm thinking wow, that's pretty sad. Tim Allen, good to see you.ALLEN: Thanks, my friend.HANNITY: All right, my friend, thank you.Coming up, ""Ask Sean"" is next. Plus we need your help, a very important ""Question of the Day"" straight head.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Welcome back to HANNITY. Time for the ""Question of the Day."" Do you think priests should be able to marry? Tough question. Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter and let us know what you think.Now, it's time for our ""Ask Sean"" segment. If you send it in via Facebook or Twitter, you might be on TV. Here is tonight's question.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hey, Sean. My name is Sabrina. So Bernie Sanders identifies as a socialist. I thought as soon as he says that, his numbers would drop. But he's obviously only been gaining in popularity. I am just wondering if that is because Americans don't know that he is a socialist, or if they actually think that socialism might work in America?(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Sabrina, first of all, that is a great, a brilliant question and a great observation. There was a time when the Democratic Party had a more conservative bench, the Scoop Jacksons, the Zell Millers, et cetera. That is part of the party that doesn't exist anymore. Obama is a socialist. And I would even argue in many ways with the high taxation we have that America is a socialist economy. When you have 46 million Americans on food stamps and 50 million in poverty and 100 million getting some government check in some way, shape, matter, or form, we kind of have that.I think we have to go back to limited government, greater freedom, and more responsibility. That's a great question. Thank you very much.If you have a question for me go to Twitter, Ask Sean Hannity is the hash-tag. Even better, send in a video and we might put your beautiful face on TV like Sabrina's.But that's all the time we have left this evening. Before we go, quick programming note. Tune in tomorrow night, 10:00 eastern, for a special edition, Fox News reporting, ""Losing Faith in America,"" anchored by my good friend Bill Hemmer.
