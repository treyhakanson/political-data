READERS OF ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.IN FOCUS: New reports of even more IRS targeting conservative groupsSTEVE FORBES: What he is guilty of is anti-democracy arrogance. There is always negotiation around raising the debt limit and budget issues. He ran through Congress a healthcare bill that no one likes, it's more unpopular today than it was 3 years ago when it was passed. It's becoming increasingly unworkable until the American people say 'enough'. He says that's arrogance, I have another word for it.MORGAN BRENNAN: I think it's a loaded word and I see why he is using it when you look at the definition. The bigger point is that this is poor politics, even worse for business. You even have republican leaning chamber of congress saying quit tying these two together and let's get some legislation through. When you look at the history of economic fiscal policy face-offs, the American economy is always the thing that takes the hit, and that's without throwing Obama-care in the mix. Look at 2011 when the last debt-ceiling face-off happened we saw stock market's plunge and a rating downgrade.SABRINA SCHAEFFER: Extortion is criminal. This president is grasping for straws because 53 percent of Americans realize that Obamacare is going to drive their healthcare costs up. Republicans are doing the right thing. This is risky business but they realize that Obamacare isn't ready for its big debut. It will drive up costs, cut jobs; we have a lot of work that needs to be done in order to implement this properly.RICK UNGAR: The moral of the story is be careful what you say in the senate because you may be in the white house one day. Obamacare didn't exist when he was a senator. I'd like to know when in our history when a piece of signature legislation for any president was held like this. If he didn't do away with his own signature legislation they were going to close the government.JOHN TAMNY: This is why republicans should be obstructionists. Obamacare is bad for our health; big government is bad for the economy. In my view, if Republicans aren't defunding one and shutting down another, what's the point in electing republicans? We hear about the bad politics and the republicans acting as obstructionists in this way but I think much worse politics for republicans would be to get to 2014 and say Obamacare is in full flower and the government is much larger, why did we put them in power to begin with?MIKE OZANIAN: The person that is guilty of extortion is president Obama, when you look at the last 3 years. His record level of spending, his record level of borrowing which has been coupled with all the bond- buying by the fed. It was totally destabilized the value of the US dollar and it's a form of extortion that has been particularly cruel to the poor and elderly who rely on fixed income. The president is the one who has committed extortion here by hurting the poor and elderly the most.President Obama claims Republicans are using 'extortion' with debt debateSTEVE FORBES: In terms of money, this is chump change by Washington's standards. This is all about politics and the proof is when this scandal first revealed itself, the IRS agents lied about it. They said it was a few rogue agents but if it wasn't a crime, why did they lie about it?RICK UNGAR: There probably aren't too many websites that are liberal with anti- Obama rhetoric. It should shock nobody that the IRS would look at websites to see if their violating 501c4's. If they are unfairly targeting one side, that's wrong. You have to show me that they are looking at both sides of this to see where there are violations in 501c4's; you should want them to be doing this. If people are getting improper tax exemptions, that's hurting both you and be no matter what side of the aisle they come on.ELIZABETH MACDONALD: I think the Tea Party was unfairly targeted based on the evidence that has been presented. The problem is that the IRS is abiding by a circus mirror of a tax code that is subjective. It doesn't have bright lines. What these groups were doing is called social welfare. They are trying to educate the people. The IRS was also using media reports for their leads. Washington Post columns that were against the tea party and that's really bad. Having a subjective tax code, here's the problem; it's like asking a herd of cats to herd themselves into a group. They can't do it without the bright lines.MIKE OZANIAN: We had the Lois Lerner email that was discovered, 2.5 years ago long before the statements were made about Cincinnati where Lerner was clearly concerned and wanted this to go up to the higher levels of the IRS. Maybe you can give the Obama administration the benefit of the doubt if he hadn't had the fast and furious, the AP situation, and the lies about Benghazi. This is pattern, they lie about everything.SABRINA SCHAEFFER: I'm glad this report came out; just add it to the pile of evidence. Remember last June when the Treasury department inspector went in and said look, if they were investigating progressive groups it was far less common, far less intrusive, and far less obstructive. The fact is that this is clearly political it has something to do with the complications of our tax code. This is a government that wants to muzzle its political opponents, it's not a conservative issue, and it's an issue about liberty.JOHN TAMNY: It's not coincidental and it's always going to be the case that entities like this will be politicized. The bigger scandal is that we live in a country where we have to prove our income to the federal government. The bigger scandal than that is that we are guilty until proven innocent in the eyes of the IRS. Reform? I think that's naive. The only way to fix this is to abolish this in favor of a national sales tax or we aren't proving what we earn on an annual basis.T. Boone Pickens falls off Forbes' richest Americans list due to bad wind farm investmentsELIZABETH MACDONALD: Let me give you quote of Al Gore's investment shop, John Doerr he runs Kleiner Perkins, he said green investing doesn't depend on government investing it's about supply and demand. We are seeing venture capitalists bringing back their investment in green tech back to 2009 levels. A recent survey said two thirds are saying they are going to invest less this year than in 2012 because they are seeing that the returns in their investment are just not coming in.MORGAN BRENNAN: I'm not a fan of wind energy. I'm not surprised that T. Boone Pickens would lose money on wind energy because I don't think it's financially viable like other technologies. For every bankrupt Fisker, you have a Tesla which is a success story. That electric car company, also a Forbes 400 billionaire, Elon Musk. That company actually paid back its half billion government loan this year, 9 years early. We have seen that stock surge more than 400 percent in the past 12 months.JOHN TAMNY: This is a reminder that when you get in bed with government it comes back to haunt you. We see that in the airline industry created by government in constant bankruptcies and now we are seen in this 12th century concept called green energy. When you pair up with the government on such a horrifying idea that would never be funded in the private sector, you will lose. Hopefully other investors have figured this out.RICK UNGAR: Since Lehman brothers went broke 5 years ago this week, and the government gave a lot of money to investment banks that means we should never invest in investment banks because an energy company didn't do well that the government invested in.STEVE FORBES: The government shouldn't be an investment capital business because it doesn't have the talent for it. Let private investors see what works and what doesn't work. Why is the government in capital investment business anyway? Whether it's green energy, housing and anything else. Let people make the decisions, not bureaucrats taking money from us and giving it to their political friends.INFORMER: Stocks inspired by Forbes' richest people in America listELIZABETH MACDONALD: Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG)INSPIRED BY WARREN BUFFETTMORGAN BRENNAN: Equity LifeStyle Properties, Inc.

5	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/08/29/kaepernick-protest-trump-tweet-draw-criticism/	Kaepernick's protest, Trump's tweet draw criticism	"This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" August 29, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: I think I know what you're doing. All right. I'm Greg Gutfeld with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Eboni Williams, Jesse Watters, and Melissa Francis -- ""The Five.""One took his seat, another chose to tweet. First, a backup quarterback for the 49ers sits for the national anthem. Now, you figure a guy who has been riding a bench all season would want to stand just for the exercise. But he was protesting oppression, linking it to patriotism. I wonder if he'll continue to sit?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)COLIN KAEPERNICK, AMERICAN FOOTBALL QUARTERBACK: I'll continue to sit. I'm going to continue to stand with the people that are being oppressed. To me, this is something that has to change. And when there's significant change and I feel like that flag represents what it's supposed to represent and this country is representing people the way that it's supposed to, I'll stand.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: So, is he right? Is our country more or less oppressive than others? If America oppresses, why do so many people risk their lives coming here to be oppressed? We do know this: Our flag represents a country where you don't have to stand up. That is the opposite of oppression, you dope. People die so you have that right to sit and mope. And in return, we can choose to mock or ignore the pampered athlete who seeks such attention.Meanwhile, Donald Trump keeps tweeting. This one after another shooting death in Chicago, he tweets: ""Dwyane Wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I've been saying, African-Americans will vote Trump."" So after a mom's shot dead your first instinct is to shout, I told you so? Is it our fault to expect more from a candidate, please?Bottom-line: Both acts of expression do nothing to unify this country. Instead, they overshadow one fact -- that it took a star athlete's relative to die in Chicago for that violence to once again matter. Trump's tweets are infantile. And the cute QB was selfish. But they didn't kill anyone, nor will their actions save anyone either.There's a theory conspiracy going around, Jesse.JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: I'm the right man to ask about that.GUTFELD: Yes, Erica's out, so you're our conspiracy guy.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: He's pursuing it.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: Obama did it.GUTFELD: Yes, there you go. Kaepernick, did he do this -- Kaepernick, did he do this to avoid getting cut because if he gets cut, then it looks political.WATTERS: I don't think he's smart enough to do that. I actually think he does believe this is an oppressive nation and this is his way to fight it. But you don't fight injustice with disrespect. And what he did was very disrespectful. I don't know if I would link this totally to Trump. I think the tactics are the same, but I think they're playing a different game. This guy is supposed to move the ball up and down the field. He's not supposed to be some crusader for social justice. Trump is using news events to leverage for votes. I think that's OK. It wasn't smooth on Twitter, but at least he's talking about it, Hillary Clinton isn't. You can get away with this in an individual sport like tennis or golf, but football's a team game. And this guy's a huge distraction. It's selfish. He better get used to sitting down on the bench because he's going to get cut. No one's going to put up with this anymore. He's a huge headache. And you know, talk about oppression, people come to this country not to be oppressed but to make a lot of money.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: A lot of people died fighting oppression, Nazis, communists, a lot of people would love to be able stand up, but they're in wheelchairs. So this guy is a joke. I don't think he will ever play again. And you know, he can do whatever he wants, though, because this is a great country.GUTFELD: Yeah, that's true. Kimberly, we're both 49er fans.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: Because we're from the Bay Area. This guy lost a lot of weight, three surgeries, no longer the double threat that he once was. Do you think this has to do with his relevance as a player decreasing and now he's looking for more relevance? He's looking beyond the sport?GUILFOYLE: You want me to dip my toe into the world of cynical. OK. So, yes, perhaps, you know, maybe because he believes he'll make a big splash for himself and he might pick up some supporters that way. But I mean, he's done as a 49er. That was my hometown. I was first lady of that team. I'm just very disappointed. I'm disappointed because he had the ability to be here, right, in this country, with a great family, with tremendous opportunities and he could do so much with his voice and his background to be able to bring people together, to be a uniter, a positive force for change. Instead, he's coming off like a spoiled, ungrateful brat. Other people have fought their lives and given it up and those families don't have their sons or daughters to come home to them at the holidays because they fought and left it on the battlefield, so people like this, you know what, could go and refuse to like stand up for the flag. Sick of him, sick of it.GUTFELD: Eboni, there are issues going on in San Francisco between the police and civilians, so he -- maybe he's somehow channeling that?EBONI WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Yeah. Those issues aren't new to the Bay Area. You know. I actually don't like Colin Kaepernick. I'm a Panthers fan. And he kind of talked some trash about my quarterbacks. I didn't like that. I love our country not because it's perfect but because she's imperfect and constantly evolving. And part of that imperfection, and I respect the right to constructively criticize.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: We get to say if we don't like the president, we get to say if we don't like what's going on with government. And I actually don't see it very dissimilar to what Colin Kaepernick is doing here. And I also respect the fact that Tim Tebow gets to kneel on that field and show his faith and honor his God and I love it. And I actually love what Colin Kaepernick did in the same way.GUTFELD: OK. That's fair point.MELISSA FRANCIS, CO-HOST: Yeah, I don't know. I don't care what he has to say about anything except quarterbacking.(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: He kind of reminds me when Mischa Barton was out there on a yacht and tweeted this sad photo of herself feeling heartbroken about -- it was one of the police shootings, she was very upset about it. It was the same kind of thing where she was saying Black Lives Matter while she was out there on a yacht looking very sad. As for Trump, I mean, just to bring it back to that, you know, the Huffington Post said that he was peddling dangerous stereotype. The dangerous stereotype that he's pointing out is this idea that Democratic policies in the inner city help people who are poor. This is really a problem of economics.GUTFELD: You thought that tweet was well done?FRANCIS: I did not say that.(LAUGHTER)FRANCIS: I did not say it. I think he needs to -- once again, Melania should take away his Twitter.GUTFELD: I agree.FRANCIS: That would make a lot of sense. But I do think he did have a point, it was just not terribly tactful or eloquently put at all.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: It is not as bad as Anthony Weiner.GUILFOYLE: You know what, you can't release policy statements on Twitter.(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: I've tried.GUILFOYLE: They have those pesky word limits. And Newt Gingrich once said this about Donald Trump. He'll say in like two or three words which he should say something in like four or five sentences because otherwise, it comes off like this.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: I get what he's trying to say, that he's trying to reach out in an earnest way to African-American communities, to Latino communities, and saying, look, these cities and these officials have failed you. Give me a chance.WILLIAMS: That was a little better, though.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: I'm available.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: His tweet didn't do that.WILLIAMS: No, you're not.GUTFELD: His tweet didn't say that's why you're going to vote for me.WILLIAMS: And that was the problem, the first two sentences of Trump's tweet were actually pretty good. They look like the tweet sent out by Dwyane Wade himself. This is horrible, this is senseless, look at the senseless crime going on in Chicago, but the third sentence of the tweet.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: . that African-Americans will vote Trump. You're reaching this conclusion.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: You're forgetting about the great follow-up tweet that he did an hour later.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: That he probably didn't write.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: Perfect timing.GUTFELD: But the tone was so different. There are definitely two writers there. Let's talk about this crime. Nykea Aldridge was hit by bullets that were supposed to be aimed at a driver. Two brothers, the suspects, they were members of the Gangster Disciples. And they just got out two weeks ago.GUILFOYLE: On parole. As in state prison, not county jail for smoking weed.GUTFELD: This is not about oppression.WATTERS: Right.GUTFELD: This is about a problem where people who should be kept behind bars are not.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: They were behind bars.GUILFOYLE: This is a huge problem. Let me tell you something. They've talked about this in Chicago but no one is listening and not Rahm Emanuel. Let me tell you something because they are letting people out that are habitual criminals, that are recidivists, that are guilty of gun violence crimes, like these guys were. They let them back out because they weren't doing the right amount of time. And the previous head of Chicago, like the captain or whatever, the superintendent said this is a problem. I'm telling you this. No one is listening to me. You know, it's not doing anyone any favors by releasing the violent criminals early, so they can reoffend and murder young mothers.WILLIAMS: You have to wonder what that process looks like, KG, because normally, you go before a parole board and you have to have an offering of proof, that you are rehabilitated and you no longer a threat to violence. These guys had nasty rap sheets, some six convictions. It really just makes no sense and it gives the whole criminal justice system a very bad name.WATTERS: I think the Democrats are just running interference for Rahm. This is their guy. They're not going to rip him in public because it makes him look bad and he's where the bodies are buried. And all these cities are controlled by Democratic mayors.WILLIAMS: Right.WATTERS: And they're all out of control. Crimes are up, poverties up. And they have to stop pointing fingers at the white man because if you look in the mirror, it is caused on their home turf. And if Trump will make an appeal like what he is going to do on Saturday and get into these black precincts and say, what have they done for you lately? If they can peel off 5 percent of that black vote, that's trouble in a swing state like a Pennsylvania or a Florida.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: But can Trump do that with this kind of tweet? That's the point here.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Speaking -- by the way, I have a new nickname for Rahm, CD-Rahm.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Eddie Johnson, superintendent of Chicago Police Department, this is responding to Donald Trump's tweet.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)EDDIE JOHNSON, SUPERINTENDENT OF CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT: As far as what Mr. Trump said, I don't have a whole lot of comment on that. If you have a magic bullet to stop the violence anywhere, not just in Chicago but in America, then please share it with us. We'll be glad to take that information and stop this violence.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Not the best metaphor.GUILFOYLE: No.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: But the fact is Donald keeps saying he's going to fix this and fix this, but how is he going to do it?GUILFOYLE: I know how. I know how. Yeah. Build a wall. You know what the problem is? Because we have open borders. I know as a prosecutor that had prosecuted narcotic cases as well, and I'm talking about high level of drugs coming in, pouring through the borders, like guess what, the gangs then sell and distribute and will kill 15 people to protect 4 square inches of space on a street corner where they sell. It's a huge problem. It keeps gangs in business, and it is a part of it. You have to cut it off right where it's feeding. That's the supply.FRANCIS: I think the other half of that, I mean, you're talking about money from drugs and the other half is economic opportunity. I mean, this is a hard thing to change but one of the things that Trump really understands. If you have nothing, you have nothing to lose. And that's when you see people tearing apart their own part of the city because they have no investment in it, no personal investment. They have no hope for the future. The educational system has failed them. There has to be a way to get people back to work, get them invested in the future, instead of feeling so hopeless and behaving this way.GUTFELD: What about the demand? You're talking about supply. The demand, if we decriminalize, then there won't be illegal activity anymore because remember, you can still get drugs into prisons and prisons are surrounded by walls.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: The wall isn't going to stop the heroin going in.WATTERS: You know about drugs in prison.GUTFELD: Yes, yes.WATTERS: You know where to get the good stuff.GUTFELD: Exactly. Where, by the way?(LAUGHTER)WATTERS: I'll tell you later.FRANCIS: We didn't know where you were going with that, by the way.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: A brief stint in San Quentin. We don't talk about it.GUTFELD: The point is none of these -- whether a presidential candidate or a media athlete, celebrity, addressed this problem, which is people are killing each other.GUILFOYLE: But you've been talking about this for how long? We've been talking about it, about the failed policies, the lack of school choice, the lack of quality education, the lack of business and economic infrastructure for jobs, for people to get back into the workforce. These are not new problems, but guess what, they're highly prevalent in liberal and Democratic controlled cities. Where is the outrage about that? That's the point, right? I mean, why aren't they demanding something be done? Instead you have the NAACP saying (ph) now, we're not for school choice or vouchers or charter schools.FRANCIS: That's exactly it. It's about schools, it's about opportunity. We saw the same thing in New York. And I know everybody keeps belaboring the example of Rudy Giuliani, but the city was so hopeless in the '90s under Dinkins and Giuliani came in and really turned it around, a lot of areas that people thought were hopelessly lost to crimes, that wasn't the case.WILLIAMS: I'm going to say this though, I think you ladies and Jesse and Greg, you're talking about really excellent points.WATTERS: Thank you.WILLIAMS: But the messenger also matters.GUTFELD: Right, right.WILLIAMS: That's really important.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: No one will listen to me. That's a good point.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: No, you're right.WILLIAMS: Because you talk about school choice and all of these, but if the credibility is not there with the messenger, the sincerity.WATTERS: Trump doesn't have street credit?(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: Hillary's been in Chappaqua too much.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: A former teacher and a former prosecutor, so I have seen that.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: If you look at the police chief in Dallas, I mean, he got people to apply to become police officers.GUILFOYLE: God bless him.GUTFELD: I'm not going to change anybody's mind. And I'm sorry, Jesse, you don't have the street credit either.(LAUGHTER)WATTERS: Real men wear pink.GUTFELD: All right. We've got to move on. Donald Trump now is preparing to address the controversy over his toned down approach to illegal immigration. His team says his position on the issue hasn't changed. Will voters buy it? Probably.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: A lot of talk on the Sunday shows this weekend on Trump's so- called softening of his position on illegal immigration. The GOP nominee is planning a big speech Wednesday in Arizona that should clear up any confusion about where he stands on the issue now. Trump's team insists the candidate has been consistent and isn't changing his immigration platform.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLYANNE CONWAY, CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR DONALD TRUMP: The signature piece of his legislation in his campaign has always been build a wall. That has not changed. Build a wall. No amnesty. No citizenship. No more sanctuary city. He wants to find a fair and humane way, and if you enforce the law and you deal with those agencies that already exist to enforce the law, then we'll see what we've got. I mean, nobody bothers to enforce the law.CHRIS CHRISTIE, NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR: The way we look at it is this is a guy that's been very consistent on no amnesty, no legalization for folks who have been coming to the country illegally. And that's always been the underpinning of his policy along with the building of the wall.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: All right. So what do we make of this issue here? Everybody says, is he changing, is he diverting, pivoting, is this about the general election or is he being consistent? Say you, Jesse, in the picture.WATTERS: I think he's being consistentish.(LAUGHTER)WATTERS: But I want to preface that by saying a few things.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: He's given three major policy addresses in the last month, and this is going to be the fourth. He's even had time to go help Louisiana flood victims. Hillary Clinton has taken off every other day in the first two weeks of August. And now, looking at her schedule no public events Thursday, no public events Friday, no public events Saturday. Are these sick days?FRANCIS: She's raking in money.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: Something fishy is going on. OK.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: I will investigate. With that said, the cornerstone of the policy was always build a wall, the wall still will be built. It's to end sanctuary cities and to deport criminal illegal aliens. He took a harsh tough tone in the primary to go to the right.FRANCIS: That's the left.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: Shifting more realistically, Obama did the same thing, remember? I'm going to lower the sea levels in the primary. I'm going to rid the world of nuclear weapons in the primary, then you kind of move to the center and do something more realistic.GUTFELD: I would use a different Obama comparison. I'm against gay marriage, wink. And I think that's what Trump is doing. He said you know, he's not going to deport 11 million people. We know that. But what we saw was he saw the emotional response he got from the start when he talked about the wall and he talked about the sanctuary cities. Sanctuary city is an incredibly valid, important issue.WATTERS: It is.GUILFOYLE: Finally.GUTFELD: And what happened is he saw the response he got and kept going. And now he's got -- he's not going to deport. He's going to try to get the criminals back, but he knows he can't do it. So now he's got to somehow pull it back. It is too late, though? Can he win back people who are -- they don't buy it. They don't believe him.FRANCIS: I think one really interesting thing though is that Democrats come out and they point out that everything he's talking about doing is already the law. He's saying he's going to create a deportation force. We already have ICE. He says he'll build a wall, we were supposed to do that for years. All they keep pointing out is that we're not following our own laws, we're not enforcing our own laws, we're not doing anything we say we're going to do. And it really just brings back his point that he's saying he's going to be the law and order president, and finally enforce some of these things. I mean, I don't know that it's a strong argument that we're already supposed to be doing these new things and Trump isn't hitting any new ground. It seems like that hurts the Democrats.WILLIAMS: I think it is a fair argument. And I think look, Trump himself talks about how Barack Obama has actually deported quite a bit of people. And look, I think the ambiguities that been a friend a foe to Donald Trump in this campaign cycle. I was actually surprised and thought he did a nice job of kind of spinning that he's evolving narrative on his head. And I think Kellyanne was really smart in how she came out and talked about all the things that are consistent. You're so smart with this, Greg.GUILFOYLE: Oh.WILLIAMS: He always talks about this with a place of negotiation, totally true. And this is playing out, most people right, they campaign in the primary on the far left and the far right and they have to govern from the center. That's the way things go in this country.GUILFOYLE: She's bringing up a good point here and using kind of the economy and how you would conduct deals and do negotiations. You give a little here, you give a little there. You are supposed to be someone who is going to listen and understand and evolve. That's part of the learning and growing process. When you're confronted with numbers and numbers then also change over time, you make adjustments. You make adjustments.GUTFELD: You think he's going to adjust on the wall?FRANCIS: No.WILLIAMS: No.WATTERS: No.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: The wall just got 10 feet taller, Greg.GUTFELD: Is it going to be a digital wall or a virtual wall or a high-tech wall?WATTERS: No.FRANCIS: No.GUTFELD: The wall could be a metaphor.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: The wall will be built and it will be a beautiful, luxurious wall.FRANCIS: With a nice door in the middle.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: Why wasn't Hillary Clinton asked about her border policy, why isn't Hillary asked about sanctuary cities, why isn't she asked about her flip-flop on drivers for illegal aliens?(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: She's never asked, but Trump, every time he puts forth a policy, how are you going to pay for it? It's so mean. Let's ask this Republican.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: They never ask the left how they pay for their programs.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: They don't care. Her surrogates are the first to say she has a huge thing on her website that explains how she feels about the wall and immigration, and it's all there. And she's just as tough as he is. There you go.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: Yeah, tough Hillary is down there wrapping up the illegals.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: She hasn't even been to the border, has she?GUTFELD: She's been to borders.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Just not any press conferences, too risky.All right, next. More Clinton State Department e-mails show top aides of the secretary did special favors for donors to her family's foundation, but one top Democratic official says it's no big deal. The latest revelations on that scandal, ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)FRANCIS: Hillary Clinton insists there is all smoke but no fire when it comes to the scandal surrounding her family's charity, but some more fire has just been found. When the crown prince of Bahrain wanted face time with Secretary Clinton, her top aide Huma Abedin worked with the Clinton Foundation to make it happen. And now, we're learning from newly released e-mails that Huma also discussed getting other big Clinton donors seats to an official lunch with Chinese President Hu Jintao. The interim chairman of the DNC doesn't seem to understand what the issue is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONA BRAZILE, INTERIM DNC CHAIRWOMAN: The way I look at it, I've been a government official. So you know, this notion that somehow or another, someone who is a supporter, someone who is a donor, somebody who is an activist saying I want access, I want to come into a room and I want to meet people, we often criminalize behavior that is normal. I don't see what the smoke is.(END VIDEO CLIP)FRANCIS: Greg, she doesn't see the issue. So somebody wants -- a donor wants access, so they ask for access and give money, she doesn't see that as a problem. That's business as usual. You pay and you get access. That seems fair.GUTFELD: Hillary and Huma turned the White House into Studio 54. You have the velvet rope, you got the bouncer, you got to grease the palms to get in there.GUILFOYLE: That's pretty funny. And true.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Huma, it's time. This is a big deal. You got rid of the husband, finally, good for you. They got to start looking at this whole thing. Because it's not just him, right? It's not just him. There's some weird stuff going on over there. They're mishandling classified e-mail, he was sexting females. I'm not sure.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: I'm not sure because -- I guess my point is this, the Anthony Weiner stuff is more titillating and more interesting, but this stuff is potentially more dangerous.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Obviously, yes.GUTFELD: And yet, the press chases that shiny ball.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: If this was Trump that did this, are you kidding me? Disqualified, canceled, et cetera. And why when the Democrats knew they had this huge problem with the Clinton Foundation and the e-mails and all the above, would they let her have a full pass, a full ride to the presidency essentially and to the nomination? It's really unbelievable.FRANCIS: Eboni, there are so many examples here that, to me, go over the line. You look at the example of UBS. That was one of the people that was included in this. The CEO of UBS wanted access to Hu Jintao. He wanted a lot of different things. He gave money to the foundation. Hillary Clinton stepped in with the Swiss and negotiated a sweetheart deal. They were tax evaders that UBS were -- was hiding. She acted on behalf of them. After they gave money, they gave even more money afterwards. What more would you need? Bread crumbs?WILLIAMS: Well, they say follow the money. I mean -- and that's really kind of the guiding principle with so much corruption. And, you know, Hillary Clinton is right. They don't have a smoking gun for say yet. But all the smoke is there.FRANCIS: Oh no?WILLIAMNS: Well, in terms of legally. You know, because if they did, she actually would have a robotic (ph).FRANCIS: What does that look like?WILLIAMS: It looks like a mess.FRANCIS: Like if you gave them the money.WILLIAMS: No, no, that's the point, right?FRANCIS: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Because the appearance of impropriety.FRANCIS: Yeah.WILLIAMS: . is critical here. And it's really bad, especially when you've been in the public life for this long. So, one has to wonder. This isn't a case of you didn't know better. No, you knew the risks and you chose to ignore them or you decide that whatever you were gaining from, it was so worth it that this makes sense.And then, look, I really have so much tremendous respect for Donna Brazile. But her saying that she doesn't find her to be a lot of smoke doesn't mean anything to me. Her objectivity is clearly questionable here because she has a long standing relationship with the Clintons. She's been an adviser for Bill Clinton on both campaign cycles. So again, her interest in finding the hypocrisy and the scandal here speaks for herself.FRANCIS: Jesse, in 2008, the President knew exactly what this is going to look like and what was going to happen. It wasn't his first dance with the Clintons. He knew how they raise money. And so he said that there had to be an arm's length distance between the foundation and between the State Department. They signed the documents saying they would do that, head to the Armed Services then Senator Kerry said, ""Please, you guys have to avoid even the appearance of impropriety."" They said they would, they did nothing like that.WATTERS: The Clinton's live in the world of impropriety and the appearance of it. FRANCIS: And they love it.WATTERS: And they love it. And Hillary Clinton is literally for sale. And she should have a bar code on her pantsuit.GUILFOYLE: So now, White House will be. That's the problem.WATTERS: And if you can listen closely, you can hear Bernie Sanders screaming all the way from Vermont because this is what this guy ran against. And I love Donna Brazile changing the defense. First it was, OK, so someone gives you money and then you do them a favor. You can't prove a quid pro quo. Now, it's, OK that's how politics works. And I remember the left was so outraged ...GUILFOYLE: Right.WATTERS: ... when Halliburton was getting contracts after Cheney was CEO and he was V.P. She literally is still in charge of the foundation and taking a lot of money.I just can't believe that people are paying money to sit next to Joe Biden.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WATTERS: That shocks me. I mean I take mine to seat away from Biden. FRANCIS: He's very nice.WATTERS: Very handy. Maybe that's what they're paying for. WILLIAMS: Oh.FRANCIS: Oh, wow. WATTERS: You know, Joe. It's only Joe. He means nothing.FRANCIS: Oh my goodness. But you know what? It looks she's moved on after that.Ahead, President Obama's former campaign manager is now playing doctor along with politics. David Plouffe gave Donald Trump a diagnosis yesterday. Oh, boy, we've got some thoughts about that one. Coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Hillary Clinton and her supporters are ramping up the personal attacks on Donald Trump to convince voters he isn't fit to be president.The latest insult came from President Obama's former campaign manager, David Plouffe.(BEING VIDEO CLIP)DAVID PLOUFFE, FORMER OBAMA CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Basically, we have a psychopath running for president. I mean he meets the clinical definition, OK?CHUCK TODD, NBC NEWS ANCHOR: Do you really think diagnosing people on air -- I assume you don't have a degree in psychology. Is that fair?PLOUFFE: The grandiose notion of self-worth, pathological lying, lack of empathy and remorse. So my point -- so here's -- I think he does.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Trump's campaign manager is calling out both the Clinton camp and those in the mainstream media for all of the name-calling.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLYANE CONWAY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Do you see what Donald Trump is called by nearly everybody in Clinton world including many of her supporters in the media before he gets out of bed in the morning? I mean this man has been called everything in the book. Insults routinely hurled at him. People think it's funny. They put it on their Twitter feeds even though they're supposed to be objective journalists.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Does Conway have a point? At least Chuck Todd pushed back on Plouffe's psychopath accusation.MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski went on air this morning and accused Trump of needing help.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKA BRZEZINSKI, NBC NEWS ANCHOR: I actually think it's time to hear from somebody in the mental health community to look at this person who has been on television for months, and to give us a sense of what we have going on here. And I'm sorry. Let's just not -- let's stop pretending. We're dealing with someone who we can completely understand.(END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Greg, I like Mika. I think she's a nice person. It's funny that when someone in our industry, the media, accuses someone else of having a big ego and not telling the truth.GUTFELD: Yeah. It's ironic. Also remember, it was a few weeks ago that the right was doing this to Hillary. Remember? Talking about Hillary, ""What's wrong with her? She had ...WATTERS: Right.GUTFELD: ... there's something wrong with her head. I don't think she's going to be able to make it as president."" It was nonstop. And it was all done as a conspiracy. And everybody on the left we're going, ""This is awful. This is bad ...FRANCIS: Trying to diagnose people.GUTFELD: ... this is dirty."" And then all of a sudden, it reverses it and we're going, ""Oh, this is terrible, this is bad."" And they're going, ""You know, you should really look at this."" So we are all hypocrites in this game ...FRANCIS: No.GUFIELD: ... and all deserve to be booed.WATTERS: This is to play devil's advocate, though.FRANCIS: Boo.GUTFELD: Thank you.WATTERS: I mean George Bush was called illiterate.FRANCIS: You're welcome.WATTERS: Palin was called a pig. I think Romney was accused of giving someone cancer. And then Trump is a key ...GUFIELD: And a bully.WATTERS: He's a racist psychopath. So, if you say Hillary coughs a lot, I don't know if that completely stacks up.FRANCIS: I don't know.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: You know what they were saying.FRANCIS: I'm not sure that calling him crazy -- I mean, what sane person would run for President of the United States anyway? I think they're all crazy. It looks terrible. I mean you're out there 24/7. Everyone's hurling everything in the world about you. And the job that you give at the end looks like an absolute nightmare. You would have to be insane to run for president. I think they all are.GUTFELD: Don't you want a psychopath as president?GUILFOYLE: No.WATTERS: I mean, someone that's going to like blackmail our enemies and like play head games.(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: With the killers?GUILFOYLE: I like that.GUTFELD: Don't you want a psychopath?WATTERS: I don't want a normal dad. It's like, ""Oh, well.""GUILFOYLE: OK. That's it. OK. But how about maybe somebody wants to actually do something good for the country, and do something for the military, and do something for the economy, and do something for families and for children for quality education because, yes, it is a thankless job. But I know somebody who really needs the job, really wants the job because they want to sell the White House, HRC?WATTERS: And it's also funny, Eboni, that--GUILFOYLE: And stay out of a jail, right?WATTERS: Plouffe, right. David Plouffe read the clinical definition of being a psychopath. And I have it here, ""The Grandiose notion of self- worth."" I remember someone gave a speech in front of Greek columns, pathological lying. If you like your health care, you can keep it. And lack of empathy. Who went golfing after an American was beheaded? So I think his old boss actually fits the definition much more so than Donald Trump.WILLIAMS: Look, I think that Donald Trump is a grown man and I think that -- look, he's absolutely been called everything in the book. For sure that's right.GUTFELD: But he's called people names.WILLIAMS: And he because he's pretty much godfather of political name- calling, from line (ph) to the crooked Hillary. This is what Trump does. And I just think, of course ...WATTERS: He can take it.WILLIAMS: ... we have to be -- of course. He's a big boy. He's a grown man. If he can dish it, of course he can take it. Yeah.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: She is crooked.WATTERS: She is crooked. And these names do stick. You think psychopath Trump is going to stick?WILLIAMS: No, it's too long.WATTERS: It's too long. That's right. That's not branded well enough.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Demented Donald?WATTERS: Ooh.GUTFELD: Demented Donald? Don't tell that to Hillary.GUILFOYLE: Don't do that.WATTERS: Do you think all of these name-calling, they did with this Ronald Reagan? Remember, he was this reckless dumb cowboy that was going to put everyone's life at risk. Do you think this is going to work with Donald Trump?FRANCIS: I don't know. I mean -- you can't really turn his own game around on him and have it stick. I don't think that doesn't necessarily works. He's pretty good at tripping himself up, so it's not like he needs a lot of help.WATTERS: You're saying don't get in the mud with Trump?FRANCIS: But I do think -- yeah, I'm like yeah, because whether they say you don't wrestle in the mud, because some people likes it, you know, I mean like.WATTERS: You know I mean you get dirty.FRANCIS: . they would get the best of you. You get dirty. Yeah, I have to stick to the place (ph) very well.GURFIELD: It's great for the skin, though.FRANCIS: It is good for the skin.GUTFELD: Yeah.FRANCIS: No. Yeah -- I mean it's ridiculous. I do think there's something to this idea of people going on television, and watching very closely, and then giving medical diagnoses. That's where the commonality was with Hillary Clinton. They were saying it's ridiculous.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: You know, on conservative blogs, they had arrows pointing at pillows. And saying we're not -- we're just -- and then the whole thing is, ""We're just raising questions.""GUILFOYLE: We're just worried.GUTFELD: Well, you know what? Now, he's raising questions. And we can't complain. I don't --I think it would be hypocritical.WATTERS: I want to get to the bottom of that pillow, though. That was a very suspicious pillow. What was she doing there?WILLIAMS: Oh my God.WATTERS: Or why does she need a pillow?GUTFELD: You are just raising questions.WATTERS: I'm just raising questions. Yeah. So, the country is in horrible shape. We're in massive amounts of debt and we're losing wars and we're talking name-calling. Basically --GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. Our military is being depleted and there's people also running who don't want to do anything to help children being killed by ISIS. They were on our set the other day.WATTERS: That's right. Well, I wasn't there so I have no idea what you're talking about.What happens when you give Kanye West four minutes of free air time to spew whatever he wants on national T.V.? We'll show you next. Plus, our folks on last night's VMA awards featuring Beyonce, Britney, Rihanna and more coming up on ""The Five"".(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: It was a big night for Beyonce at the VMA awards last night. She performed nearly half the songs from her hit album ""Lemonade"". Rihanna also dominated the night with four performances. And Britney Spears made a comeback. We'll get into all of that in just a minute, but first, Kanye. Four minutes was granted for Kanye West to do, well, whatever he wanted. And as you might expect, Kanye was Kanye, but it wasn't completely off the rails.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KANYE WEST, RECORDING ARTIST: Later tonight, ""Famous"" might lose to Beyonce, but I can't be mad. I'm always wishing for Beyonce to win, so.You know like people come up to me, like, ""Man, that's right, take Taylor."" Bro, like, I love all you all. That's why I called her.My role models are artist, merchants, Truman, Ford, Hughes, Disney, Jobs, West.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Wow. OK. Having a little bit of a discussion here like was Truman intentional? I think it was. You have to remember Kanye's mom was Dr. Donda West. She was a professor. I mean like he's really like into the history and all that jazz. So, I think he meant all of that. Narcissism?GUILFOYLE: Then he included himself.WILLIAMS: And then of course he included himself (inaudible) because he's the greatest philosopher of all time.GUILFOYLE: Oh, he's rapping like a lyrical poet. All right. What do you want me to tell you?WILLIAMS: I don't. Like seriously.FRANCIS: Here. I'll jump in. So it's glad that we've cut this up because I watched it in realtime. And I fell asleep three times. I mean there was all this empty space in here where he's trying to think of what he's going to say next.(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: He just proves that when you try to stop him from talking, he has a million things to say, but when they gave him the floor. He's sort of stammering. He's trying to remember what he's going to say. I mean, he was boring.GUTFELD: He is going to be our next president in 2020. Trump is paving the way for Kanye. And that's a fact. He will be running.But trying to find something intellectually gratifying at the VMA is like trying to find tofu at a barbecue. That's on you. That's not your fault. This is -- this whole entire show is devoted to kids. If the mindset is for a 15-year-old girl, if you look at everybody there -- and so if you're 27 and you're watching this, you should feel old.WATTERS: You were watching it last night.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: I was.WATTERS: I think, I was going through Twitter and I'm seeing Greg comment, ""Live on the VMA.""GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.WATTERS: What are you doing?GUTFELD: I have the mentality of the 15-year-old girl. It's true.GUILFOYLE: No, no, 15-year-old boy.WILLIAMS: No, say boy.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS: I know it's Greg. Yeah.FRANCIS: Exactly. There you go.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: I watched you instead, Melissa.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Kanye is constantly talking about Beyonce and how is 50th (ph). Like do you think Jay-Z is bothered by them?WATTERS: Then he gave a shoutout to this Amber Rose chick, who he fooled around with, while Kim was right in the audience. Damn, that's a bold move.WILLIAMS: Yeah.WATTERS: Can you believe that?WILLIAMS: Well, I can believe it, but I just think that that's so weird. OK. So let me go through ...GUILFOYLE: What kind of show is this again?WILLIAMS: I grew up with Britney Spears. She made her big comeback. She hadn't performed since 2007.GUTFELD: She's listening.WILLIAMS: Yeah, she looks pink. Let's call for Britney. Let's see if what Britney is bringing.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, to see what happened.WILLIAMS: OK. Maybe we don't have that. Here we go.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(Music)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Nobody's for Kanye anymore (ph).(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Kanye might have been rooting for Beyonce, but I was rooting for Britney. And I really wanted her to do something incredible and amazing and this was so disappointing. And so, she's got a live show in Vegas right now. If this is any representation, Greg, I can't go there. Yeah, she's now in Vegas.GUILFOYLE: Why don't we do a five field trip when we're going to have the show live?GUTFELD: Well, I was going to be there for the debate.GUILFOYLE: For the debate.GUTFELD: So I got to be there for the debate. So, we might (inaudible). Who is Britney for? Because if you grew up with Britney, you're no longer with Britney.WILLAIMS: No, we're not.GUTFELD: Who is for Britney?WILLIAMS: I'm not with here.FRANCIS: OK. So I would .(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: . circus concert. It was my birthday. My husband bought one of the seats on one of those velvet couches up front.WILLIAMS: Wow. You did?(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: Well, here's the thing, she didn't sing then, she doesn't sing. Now, I mean, why did you get a thing? Nobody at this show was singing. They all came out. They've sort of dance around, maybe a little bit ...WATTERS: Because you know what?(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: No one sings. No one sings.WATTERS: And everyone is talking about the Britney comeback.WILLIAMS: Not at all.WATTERS: And she's been on top as far as I'm concerned. Well, I mean, she never fell off.GUILFOYLE: She's the world's favorite.WATTERS: Yeah, she's always on the top of the list.WILLIAMS: You're so optimistic, Jesse. That's really nice.OK. So, there was also Fallon who did a Ryan Lochte impression because no one (inaudible) of talking about Ryan Lochte. Let's call for that. It is Ryan Lochte, people.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)JIMMY FALLON, COMEDIAN: Anyway, who has the best video of the year? I can't tell you that. They're all so great and so talented, I could never choose. I couldn't tell you, even if there was a gun to my head.(END VIDEO TAPE)WILLIAMS: Greg, I think he wanted an excuse to bleach his hair.GUTFELD: Yeah, because that was not impersonation. It was Jimmy Fallon in a wig.WATTERS: When you would steal the show by impersonating Ryan Lochte, it's not a very good show.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: I think on that note, ""One More Thing"" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: Time for ""One More Thing"". Let's go to you, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Thank you, Greg. Well, big congratulations to the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves celebrating their 100th anniversary today. It was established on this day, August 29th, 1916 by President Woodrow Wilson.From World War I to the war on terror, the Marine Corps Reserve has played an essential role in the Marine Corps total force by augmenting and reinforcing the active component across a full range of military operations. There are approximately 38,188 reserve marines and 184 reserve training centers located throughout the United States of America. Marines and veterans gathered earlier this morning in Times Square to celebrate. We are so very proud of their service. God bless you and God bless this country.GUTFELD: Excellent. Well done.All right, time for something less.FRANCIS: Patriotic poll (ph)?GUTFELD: . important. Greg's happily ever after. You know, after I said that the Red Hot Chili Peppers were the worst band on the planet, I then apologized and I said they were the worst band in the universe.Flea, the bass player responded, and he said that he didn't mind. He said that it was great. He thought our show was funny and he said it was OK to have your own opinion and he was very happy.And I thought this was a really great example of how differences can be solved so easily, by simply agreeing with me.FRANCIS: By complimenting you.WATTERS: Yes.FRANCIS: Yes, by complimenting you.(OFF-MIC)GUTFELD: No, no, no. He agreed that his band is terrible.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: I thought that was so sweet.GUILFOYLE: I love the Red Hot Chili Pepper.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, I love them.(CROSSTALK)FRANCIS: The ladies love them. Don't worry.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: Yeah, you know, nobody could say. I heard that it's funny. I don't care. They're welcome to hate us. God bless them.FRANCIS: Right.GUTFELD: God bless you, Flea.GUILFOYLE: Don't worry about that little peak over there, Flea.WATTERS: OK. OK. Hot off the presses just in time for back-to-school. The top 10 ranked party schools in America. Here we go. Number 10, Colgate, Tulane, Syracuse University, University of Mississippi, Iowa, there's nothing else, nothing to do there. Bucknell .GUTFELD: Next topic.WATTERS: Sorry. Lehigh Patriot League, and full force University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, West Virginia at number two, and the number one .WILLIAMS: Harvard, Harvard, Harvard.WATTERS: . party school, University of Wisconsin.FRANCIS: Wow.GUTFELD: All right.WATTERS: The problem is, well, now they're going to crackdown at the University of Wisconsin. So I think West Virginia is right where they need to be.GUTFELD: All right.FRANCIS: There you go.WILLIAMS: Feature ""Watters World"" ...WATTERS: Don't give it away.FRANCIS: Endwell, New York appropriately made one at the Little League World Series. Look at this video of these guys celebrating. It's very cute. Ended their season 24 in zero. They were 2-0. They were totally undefeated. There is a huge parade in their hometown. Look at the kids, so happy, something positive, something to celebrate. There they are. No one checked their birth certificates or I.D.s. I'm sure they all were great.GUTFELD: Excellent.FRANCIS: But New York hasn't won it since 1964 or something like that.WILLIAMS: But I'm sure you're right. I'm sure you're right.So we lost a great one today, guys. Gene Wilder passed away today at 83 years old, of course, made famous from ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", the producers of ""Blazing Saddles"", who is actually nominated for three Academy Awards, the ""Young Frankenstein"". Shoutout to all your favorite Gene movies. And nephews said he passed away from complications of Alzheimer's disease. But, you know, he brought us so much laughter. So whimsical, you know, you know, just so creative and fantastic.GUTFELD: One of the best. One of the best. Willy Wonka, everybody remembers that movie.GUILFOYLE: The most terrifying movie of all time.WATTER: I do love that.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: I love that. Everybody there was height.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Set your DVR so you never miss an episode of ""The Five"". That's it for us.
