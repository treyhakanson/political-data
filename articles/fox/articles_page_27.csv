This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: This is an important step in putting the lid on Iran's nuclear program, but we have to treat this as an ongoing enforcement effort, which I certainly strongly support and as president would be absolutely devoted to ensuring that the agreement is --(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Hillary Clinton on Capitol Hill meeting with Democrats supporting this Iran deal wholeheartedly. We're back with the panel. Mara, interesting, behind the scenes Democrats said she was even more cheering this deal. What does that mean politically?MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: I think it means that the Democrats own this deal, I think even though there will be Democrats who vote against it. But I think it is already a campaign issue and it will continue to be one, and the Republicans can say I would have made a better deal or I wouldn't have made my deal at all and we would have tightened sanctions. That's a hypothetical. We don't know if that would have really happened. But the Democrats will own this. And if Iran does start being more aggressive in the short-term, that's going to be a problem during the campaign.BAIER: And so while we're in this part where Congress is doing head counting, going through the details, you think this means something?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: No. I think the whole Congress debate, which we're not going to jump into feet first, be consumed by, is irrelevant, because we are now going to go to the U.N. And the resolutions that had prohibited the Iranian program are going to be abolished within days. They are going to accept is the agreement, which means the 10 years of constructing international sanctions, the Europeans, the Russians and the Chinese, is over. All we will be debating here is American sanctions, which means, assuming the agreement is rejected we are going to be left isolated with our sanctions. The rest of the world is going to be dealing with Iran. Its economy he is going to expand, and it will have is won everything because we're going to have a deal that's no deal and the sanctions will be lost.That was the original sin of the negotiation which Obama either understood and was deliberate about it or simply misguided in not understanding it.BAIER: Gillian, it's important to point out that we don't know the success or failure of this deal until well after President Obama is gone, left office, really, when you talk about imposing the sanctions. So, what about this in this debate that we're going to see?GILLIAN TURNER, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL STAFFER: Well, you know, in some regards, this is really a spectacular case of government doing what it does best, which is kicking the can down the road. In as little as just a couple of years the Iranians are potentially going to have the ability to buy and sell arms on the international market. Eight years they will be able to resume research into advanced nuclear materials, and in 15 years produce as much nuclear fuel as they would like. So there is a lot to worry about there.BAIER: Steve, a lot of people are saying Russia is the big winner tonight.STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Russia is certainly going to be the winner financially given its arms investments in Iran and ones that are to come.I want to go back to the Hillary Clinton statement for a second. I think it's worth pausing on that for a minute. She embraces the deal and says in effect we're going to approve this deal and we're going to deal with Iran and their bad behavior later. Think about that. This is a deal that cedes vast power to the Iranian regime, flush with money after this deal. And now we are going to after having formalized them as the regional hegemon, now we are going to try to deal with their behavior? This is exactly backwards. If I were advising Republican presidential candidates, I would tell them to make that famous.BAIER: And a lot of them did. We could have run a lot of sound bites the entire panel, every Republican against this deal. It will be an issue on that debate stage in Cleveland, too.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: A lot of money is being thrown around during the 2016 elections, but Senator Bernie Sanders supporters were literally throwing money in Los Angeles. Supporters tossing 1,000 one dollar bills at Secretary Clinton's motorcade as she arrived at Hollywood actor George Clooney's home for $33,400 per person fundraiser.And even Clooney is admitting it's the ridiculous to have this kind of money in politics.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE CLOONEY, ACTOR/ACTIVIST: I think we had protesters last night when we pulled up in San Francisco. And they're right to protest. They are absolutely right, it is an obscene amount of money. The Sanders campaign when they talk about it is absolutely right. It's ridiculous that we should have this kind of money in politics. I agree completely.The overwhelming amount of money that we are raising, and it is a lot, but the overwhelming amount of the money that we are raising is not going to Hillary to run for president. It's going to the down ticket. It's going to the congressman and senators to try to take back Congress.(END VIDEO CLIP)VAN SUSTEREN: Radio talk show host and star and editor-in-chief of LifeZette, Laura Ingraham, is here.Laura, George Clooney, who hosted this fundraiser said it's an obscene amount of money.LAURA INGRAHAM, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Oh, brother, where art thou. Common sense.I was trying to think of some Clooney movie you make a pun with there. He's raised millions and millions and millions of dollars over the years for Democrat causes, including, of course, the Clintons, and $15 million I believe just over the weekend, that fundraiser. I believe there's another. And he goes on television, like, oh, this is terrible, this is awful.Well, if it's really a distortion of democracy, then don't raise the money.VAN SUSTEREN: But this is sort of self-defense, is he thinking that the other guy is doing it. I'm not in favor of that. I mean, everybody says the money is terrible but everybody does it.INGRAHAM: What gets -- I mean, I was thinking about it. The money they spend on, what, putting on these insipid award shows? I mean, how many award shows do we have for Hollywood?VAN SUSTEREN: Actually, there's something like one every night.INGRAHAM: I think -- there's like every channel has award show. Think of the money they spend on that. Think on the money they spend just on the swag bags that they give the presenters for the award.So, I guess he is trying to play to both sides. I think Bernie Sanders is playing this smart though because they're sending out appeals for $2.70.VAN SUSTEREN: Bernie Sanders says new fundraising letter that went out to everyone says this, ""There is something I need to share with you, and it's probably going to anger you. It should probably anger everyone. Here it is, our opponent,"" meaning Secretary Clinton, ""is bending campaign finance through breaking points so Wall Street fat cats so people like Wal-Mart's Alice Walton can get away with giving hundreds of thousands of dollars in a single contribution to benefit the Clinton campaign.""INGRAHAM: Think about Sanders has raised $45 million through very small contributions. That's pretty impressive. And that goes with his whole deal. I mean, power to the people. This is the people's campaign. Hillary's campaign, it's the fat cats in Hollywood like Clooney, despite protestations to the contrary, and Goldman Sachs, Wall Street, all those guys.This is great meme for Sanders to go to town on. And I think he's doing, he's up for the right things. Same time, I mean, they do have to raise money. And they're going to have to compete against whoever the Republican nominee is, and there's a report, though, that Hillary is not sending as much money down ticket as Mr. Clooney might believe.VAN SUSTEREN: That means the DNC, they pay for the different senators and --INGRAHAM: You know, Hillary, all these feminists, Greta were complaining, well, you are throwing dollar bills at Hillary's motorcade, that's like you are treating her like a stripper. Hillary should have said, look, at least throw 20's or like 50's or 100s at me. These guys are so rich they could throw hundreds of dollar bills to people, but they just threw -- they didn't throw those old coins, dollar coins that could have hurt.VAN SUSTEREN: Indeed. Anyway, Laura, thank you.INGRAHAM: Good to see you."
