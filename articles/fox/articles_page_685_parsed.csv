1	1	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/06/27/greta-its-time-attorney-general-eric-holder-go/	Greta: It's time for Attorney General Eric Holder to go	" By Greta Van SusterenIt's time for Attorney General Eric Holder to go - either resign or President Obama should fire him.The attorney general's job is to protect the American people, and that includes protecting them from bad government officials and renegade government agencies. Holder is not doing his job. And since he won't do it, he should at least have the decency to appoint someone who will, a special prosecutor. But he won't do that, either.I don't get Holder. He actually was a really fair, good judge. Now he seems to play partisan politics and at the American taxpayers' citizen's expense. That's wrong. By now, he should be finished with an investigation of Lois Lerner and the IRS. It's been 14 months. He has tens of thousands of prosecutors working for him. Investigation doesn't mean conviction. It simply means getting to the bottom of suspicious behavior. And there is plenty of that, from Lerner taking the Fifth or her email to the FEC sharing confidential taxpayer information to last night's really big bombshell that Lerner was targeting a Republican U.S. Senator with a bogus accusation, so bogus that her IRS colleague had to pull her off the ceiling.The American people deserve a full and fair investigation, no matter where the facts lead. We sure don't deserve or need an attorney general who won't do his job. Holder has to go. Mr. President, if you're listening -- and I do think you watch FOX -- fire that attorney general. That's my ""Off the Record"" comment tonight."	['Obama']	[]
