This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.TRISH REGAN, GUEST HOST: Breaking tonight, a remarkable week between Donald Trump and the media. He's being accused of inciting violence against Hillary Clinton and of believing that Mrs. Clinton and the President were the founders of ISIS.Trump today insisting he's simply misunderstood and he is misrepresented by the media. Is he? And if so, how might the media influence the outcome of this election? At what point does this start to become a self-fulfilling prophecy?Welcome, everyone, to THE KELLY FILE, a special Trump versus the Media. I am Trish Regan in for Megyn Kelly tonight. So let me walk you through it. Quite a week. On Wednesday, Trump was declaring that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the founders of the terror group known as ISIS. This remark coming just 24 hours after his comments about Second Amendment supporters, comments which some interpret as a call for violence against the Democratic nominee. He insists it is not. Meanwhile, he told a conservative radio host this about the President and Clinton's role in creating ISIS. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HUGH HEWITT, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Last night, you said the President was the founder of ISIS. I know what you meant. You meant that he created the vacuum. He lost the peace.DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: No. I meant he's the founder of ISIS. I do. He was the most valuable player. I give him the most valuable player award. I give her too by the way.HEWITT: But he's not sympathetic to them. He hates them. He's trying to kill them.TRUMP: I don't care. He was the founder.(END VIDEO CLIP)REGAN: You know, but today he took to Twitter and he said, nah, I was just kidding on that, writing that, quote, ""The media needs a serious lesson in sarcasm."" And not only did Trump suggest he was kidding, he said this at his Pennsylvania rally today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: So I said, Obama is the founder of ISIS. The founder. And these dishonest media people, the most dishonest people, they said, oh, did he mean that? Obviously I'm being sarcastic. Then, then -- but not that sarcastic to be honest with you.(END VIDEO CLIP)REGAN: Maybe this is why people show up at these rallies. A little bit of humor there. Trump campaign national spokesperson Katrina Pierson joins us in moments. But first, we have more from chief political correspondent Carl Cameron, who has more from Pennsylvania tonight. Carl.CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Trish. Trump here in Altoona, Pennsylvania, this evening went back to the well when it comes to Barack Obama being the quote, ""founder of ISIS."" And as you just showed earlier today, he continues to debate himself on this issue. And so, tonight he renewed that. Listen to the new version.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I have been for numerous days sarcastically saying that he is the founder of ISIS. Don't forget when he took over, I think they were in eight countries, seven countries. Now I understand they're in 28 countries. They're rampant all over the world. So I've been saying and I'll keep saying because it's true, but somewhat sarcastically, I've been saying he's the founder of ISIS, and I say she's a close second. If it weren't for them, you probably wouldn't even have ISIS.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAMERON: Self-contradictory statements like that explain why so many Republicans have doubts about Trump's ability to beat Hillary Clinton come Election Day, and there are a number of polls in battleground states that suggest that Clinton has been surging and Trump has been fairly flat in the polls since his convention. New Marist polls in Florida say that Trump has slipped to five points behind Clinton, 44-39. In North Carolina, she's ahead nine points, 48 to 39.In Virginia, Clinton's up 13 points, 46 to 33. And in Colorado, she now trails by 14 points behind Hillary Clinton. Here in Pennsylvania, polls this week suggest that Hillary Clinton has pushed out to a lead, and today Trump said the only way he's going to lose Pennsylvania is if there's voter fraud. Cheating is the word he used, and he urged his voters, when they go to the polls in November, to watch for any of it. And if they see any irregularities, to call the sheriff or the cops -- Trish.REGAN: All right. Thank you very much, Carl.Joining us right now to respond to the week that was and what's coming up, Katrina Pierson, Trump campaign national spokesperson. So, Katrina, the media can't take a joke?KATRINA PIERSON, DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTER: Well, they can, but not when a Republican tells a joke. I mean the sarcasm is definitely one-sided. I don't recall a four-day fallout or even follow-up questioning when Hillary Clinton said she wiped her server clean with a cloth. No one asked if it was a terry cloth, if it was microfiber because they knew she was kidding. And this is the exact same thing.And when Trump says it was sarcasm but not really, of course he's being sarcastic about Obama being the literal founder of ISIS. Of course Obama didn't file any paperwork of incorporation, but he's very serious because it was the Obama/Clinton failed foreign policies that gave birth to ISIS because we know for a fact they ignored the intelligence coming from the Middle East.REGAN: Hugh Hewitt gave him the opportunity to basically say that, and he said, no, no, he's the founder. I mean, she's the founder. Is that in part because he's trying to drill this message in to people that, in fact, it is the failed policies of the Obama administration that have led to the rise of ISIS?PIERSON: Oh, absolutely. And even further in that Hugh Hewitt interview, he talks about the policies and how horrible that they were, the way they went into Iraq and exited, and basically put all of their positions out there for all the public to see. But this goes further than that because I've heard specifically over at CNN saying, well, Donald Trump said he would have followed the same timeline. You cannot compare a private citizen that does not have access to intelligence information like the August 2012 DIA report, which told Obama and Secretary Clinton that if you go in and arm the rebels in Syria, if you do X, Y, and Z, this is what will happen.They told them in that report in 2012 that there would be a vacuum created and also told them that ISIS itself would form, the Islamic State. And General Flynn came out and reported blatantly that this wasn't just a blind eye the President and Hillary Clinton turned. It was willfully ignored intelligence, and now we have global terrorism.REGAN: You know, let me ask you, Katrina. Do you think in some ways, he's -- he's hurt by the fact that he is willing to go out there and speak so candidly at these rallies, not on teleprompter. I mean Hillary Clinton it's been 250-plus days since she's had a legitimate press conference. In fact, I think the last one was the one where that server joke came up. So, he's out there talking all the time. Is this what's getting him in trouble?PIERSON: Well, I think it's only getting him in trouble with those who have an agenda. The American people see right through this. There's no question about that. Hillary Clinton can turn out 150 people to her events. Donald Trump is turning out 15,000. Donald Trump is speaking past the mainstream media, past the pundits, and speaking directly to the folks, and that's what's important. And I wouldn't even look at these polls coming out right now. We saw the last couple of weeks NBC, and ABC, those guys were all weighting their polls differently to show Hillary Clinton above.I have no doubt this is exact same thing that's happening because they see that crowd as well. Remember, Trish, we were told for a year Donald Trump didn't have a campaign. It was awful. He didn't have staff. There was no ground game, and he broke the record in turnout. So the Trump campaign, we're just fine. We're moving forward and heading into November.REGAN: All right. We'll be watching. Thank you so much, Katrina Pierson. So, you know, Katrina talked about the polls. We're going to get to those in just a little bit, but she also mentioned whether or not these controversies matter in the minds of voters. She says they don't.Here to debate it, Ben Domenech, publisher of The Federalist. And Marcy Stech, vice president of communications at Emily's List. Ben, what do you think the takeaway is for your average voter out there that's watching this media circus --BEN DOMENECH, PUBLISHER, THE FEDERALIST: Well, I have to say this -- I'm not typically on this program defending something from Donald Trump. But this week the pearl clutching that I saw from the media over these comments, it was just silly. It was gas lighting. This reaction as if he was suggesting that Obama had actually organized and founded ISIS and some sort of real serious way, it was just ridiculous. I mean, were they asking these questions when Hillary Clinton was saying that Donald Trump was the lead recruiter for ISIS.Were they asking these questions when Elizabeth Warren was saying that Republicans wanted to sell guns to ISIS. The simple fact is this. This is a foreign policy critique he's making. It's a typical Trump exaggeration because he knows if you say something like created a vacuum, that's what led to the rise of ISIS --REGAN: Yes.DOMENECH: That is not something that's going to get reported about. This comment does.REGAN: Yet the other side is doing it. We heard both President Obama and Mrs. Clinton refer to this exact same thing in their own style, in their own way. Marcy, I'm going to play this for you, and I'd like your reaction.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRES. BARACK OBAMA (D), UNITED STATES: I think the kinds of rhetoric that we've heard too often from Mr. Trump and others is ultimately helping do ISIL's work.HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: He is becoming ISIS' best recruiter. They are going to people, showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.(END VIDEO CLIP)REGAN: Whoa. All right. So where was the media then, Marcy?MARCY STECH, VP OF COMMUNICATIONS, EMILY'S LIST: Look, I have to tell you this week watching Donald Trump do what he has been doing, defending himself, defending sexual harassment in the workplace, talking about --REGAN: No, no, no. Marcy, forgive me, but I did play that clip for you. I want to get your reaction. What do you think of those on the left saying stuff like that and not being held accountable for that?STECH: There is absolutely some merit to the questions that Donald Trump is being asked every single day about his credibility on the issues and the ability to keeping the American people safe. Look, I think that we saw this week Donald Trump incited violence against Hillary Clinton.REGAN: Okay. Again, you didn't respond to what I showed you. I mean, look, I'll let you have a shot at it, Ben. I mean, those folks, both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama essentially said the same thing. I mean maybe they've got a better tone, more stylized tone, but the exact same stuff.DOMENECH: I certainly wish that Donald Trump would talk less and smile more, but I think this is a situation where unfortunately for the media, the fact is that in January, Donald Trump said that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were the inventors of ISIS, the creators of ISIS, and the founders of ISIS. He said it three different times in January. Here's the difference. In January, he was beating up on other conservative candidates, and the media didn't care about it. Now he's beating up on Hillary Clinton, and they do.STECH: So, in January, he wasn't the Republican nominee for president of the United States.DOMENECH: So the media changes the way they approach somebody --STECH: You know what? Everything he says is on the table, and you know what, the media's job is to ask questions and dig deeper.REGAN: Well, I got one more for you because he was under a lot of criticism as well this week for what many said was inciting violence, that Second Amendment supporters were somehow going to go out and there would be this call to arms for potentially the assassination -- a horrible thing to talk about -- of Hillary Clinton. He said, no, that's not what I meant at all. But here you go. How do you like this? Back in 2008, Hillary Clinton is being asked why don't you get out of this race? Because you know why? The media wanted Obama to take it. And here's what she said. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: My husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the California primary somewhere in the middle of June, right? We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California. I, you know, regret that if my referencing that moment of trauma for our entire nation and particularly for the Kennedy family was in any way offensive.(END VIDEO CLIP)REGAN: Offensive? I mean here you've got the first African-American candidate who has actually got a shot at winning the nomination, and she's talking about Bobby Kennedy and assassination? I mean so, again, you know, two wrongs don't make a right. But I would hesitate to say that Donald Trump was going as far, Marcy, as she actually went there.STECH: Well, I have to tell you that these conversations that we're having right now about things she said years ago are not actually what voters are thinking about and talking about on a regular basis. Right now they want to talk about the issues.REGAN: I mean that's where the media seems to be falling short because nobody remembered what she said in --STECH: What we are experiencing right now is not Mitt Romney versus Barack Obama. Look, I am a Democrat. In 2012, when Mitt Romney won that election, if he would have won that election, I would have been upset, but you know what? I wouldn't have been concerned about the safety of the American people.REGAN: Yes. And we heard that though back then as well. Didn't we hear, right? That, you know, Mitt Romney was going to be a disaster for the country?DOMENECH: ""The New York Times"" called him unfit. They said that he was someone who you couldn't trust in this office. Look, this is the situation. The voters care about the fact that under President Obama and that under Hillary Clinton, we saw mistakes made in Syria and Libya across the Middle East that led to the rise of ISIS. The question of who's going to deal with it going forward is now before them and they have to decide who they're going to trust.REGAN: All right. Lots of good stuff to talk about in the coming days. Thank you so much to both of you. Ben and Marcy.DOMENECH: Thank you.REGAN: New calls, everyone, to investigate Hillary Clinton's charity as we get reports that the Justice Department may have shielded the Clinton Foundation from the FBI. Attorney David Wohl and Alan Colmes are here on that, on whether we can expect answers from the Clintons anytime soon, anytime at all.Plus, Donald Trump is slamming the media for what he's calling an obvious bias, a bias in favor of Hillary Clinton. Dr. Ben Carson says the media is focusing on Trump for one simple reason. He's next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The biggest rigger of the system is the media. The media is rigged. It's rigged. It's crooked as hell.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: There is absolutely no connection between anything that I did as secretary of state and the Clinton Foundation.(END VIDEO CLIP)REGAN: That was former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY"" with Chris Wallace, insisting that she kept official government business separate from the work of her multibillion-dollar family charity, the Clinton Foundation. But tonight there are new reports being added to a growing list of allegations that those lines were blurred between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation. And investigators and lawmakers are taking this very seriously.FOX News correspondent Rich Edson is live in Washington with the latest for us. Rich?RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Trish. And a top Senate Republican is urging the Department of Justice to investigate the connection between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department. In a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn writes, ""Representatives of the foundation repeatedly sought special treatment for its donors and associates from senior officials at the State Department. This kind of conduct is unacceptable and reflects the worst concerns harbored by the public about the abuse of government office to benefit the powerful.""Critics have charged the Clinton Foundation allowed donors to buy influence with the State Department, Clinton and her campaign deny that. In January, FOX News reported the FBI was investigating the possible intersection of the State Department and the Clinton Foundation. Senior Justice Department communication officials maintain that they know of no current investigation into Hillary Clinton or the Clinton Foundation. However, these same officials say if there were an investigation by other offices, they may not know about it.The Clinton campaign is also defending a trip by then Secretary Clinton's chief of staff, Cheryl Mills. She traveled to New York to conduct business for the Clinton Foundation. A Clinton campaign spokesman says, quote, ""Cheryl volunteered her personal time to a charitable organization, as she has to other charities. Cheryl paid for her travel to New York City personally, and it was crystal clear to all involved that this had nothing to do with her official duties. The idea that this poses a conflict of interest is absurd."" A State Department spokesperson adds, government employees can work on other projects on their own time, as long as they follow federal ethics rules -- Trish.REGAN: All right. Rich Edson, thank you so much. As we await responses to these new and lingering questions over the Clinton Foundation, there are now growing concerns tonight over whether Hillary Clinton will ever give the American people any answers at all. Because the last time Mrs. Clinton held a traditional news conference -- how do you like this? December 4th, 2015. That was 252 days ago. One reporter going so far as to say, you know, she is the least accessible presidential nominee in modern times.David Wohl is an attorney and Trump supporter, and Alan Colmes is host of ""The Alan Colmes Show."" David, what's she so afraid of?DAVID WOHL, ATTORNEY: Well, I mean, Trish, granted she doesn't speak too well off teleprompter and she doesn't tend to ad-lib too well. But she has issues that transcends politics. She has serious Fifth Amendment issues. I mean, it's been scandal after scandal. First the e-mail server scandal, then the perjuring herself at Benghazi scandal. Now these 44 e-mails indicate that her chief of staff -- and don't tell me it wasn't at her direction -- engaged in beneficial activities for fat cat donors to the Clinton Foundation, basically in total violation of ethical standards.And in my estimation, this could be public corruption criminal charges. So if I'm advising Hillary Clinton, I'm going to tell her, you know what, you're not going to do any press conferences because if you give the wrong answer to one of these questions that are no doubt forthcoming, you could be handcuffed the next day.WOHL: Yes, I mean --COLMES: It's that serious.WOHL: Yes, I mean, not to mention she's not, as you said earlier, the most natural in those situations with those press conferences. Alan, you know, I got to say, this stuff just doesn't look good. The appearance of it sure doesn't feel good. Your thoughts.ALAN COLMES, HOST, ""THE ALAN COLMES SHOW"": It may not feel good to you.REGAN: It can't feel good to anyone. I mean, I don't want a member of my government, you know, taking payouts.COLMES: Well, there's no evidence of that. That's not been proven.REGAN: Let me jump in, and you'll get a chance. But one thing that really I have found issue with -- and again I come from a financial background -- UBS United Bank of Switzerland.COLMES: Uh-hmm.REGAN: They tried to get a bunch of their clients off the hook because the IRS was looking into whether or not the people who were committing some kind of tax evasion. About 55,000 clients. And so, they went to Hillary Clinton and the State Department, and guess what? She got them off the hook. It turned out only 4,500 of them had to be investigated by the IRS. So, that was a good deal.And then the biggest speaking fee of Bill Clinton's year, $1.5 million in speaking fees he collected from the United Bank of Switzerland after this whole thing goes through. Alan, I just look at that, and I say, you know, couldn't she have said, hey, hon, you know, maybe sit this one out. You're making enough money already. I'm doing a deal with them on the side. Again, it speaks to this inherent conflict of interest that seemed to be happening --COLMES: Again, there's no evidence that there's any quid pro quo here. Cheryl Mills who was just mentioned, who was on her own time. That's already been proven. David --WOHL: Please, Alan.COLMES: If I could please finish a thought. David, you just accused Hillary Clinton of perjury. She's not been indicted. She's not been convicted. You're putting out false information.WOHL: Jim Comey came out of his press conference and said, yes, she did lie about the e-mail information at the Benghazi hearing. He said she didn't --COLMES: No, no, no -- she was not convicted of perjury. She was not indicted. You're making a false claim. You're making a false claim.WOHL: He said, no, no, no. He said, I need a referral and I'll investigate it. But he said, yes, she did lie.COLMES: Why wasn't she indicted, then?WOHL: Because he didn't have a referral to investigate.REGAN: Alan, David is right. Effectively he said she was not fully truthful.COLMES: Then she should have been indicted but she wasn't. There was no - -WOHL: She should have been --REGAN: Alan, I don't know how she gets indicted when the President would effectively be indicting his own administration. I mean, he had a little bit of a self-interest in making sure the DOJ did not do that.COLMES: You had a Republican FBI head saying that there was no precedents to indict. There was no reason and there was no intent. That's the reason why.REGAN: Hey, Alan, let me ask you --COLMES: Alan, Alan, Loretta Lynch --REGAN: Hang on one second, David. There's more news coming forward that I want to get to because we just have a short amount of time.COLMES: Okay.REGAN: But we are hearing reports that the FBI did want an investigation into perceived conflicts the Clinton Foundation and the State Department and that DOJ shut them down. Alan, you know, I realize that, you know, you're more on the left, and you're advocating her side.COLMES: Proudly. Proudly.REGAN: However, however -- isn't there a part of you that just says, you know, maybe it's work checking out because it sure doesn't seem right?COLMES: I would question that you have John Cornyn, who you mentioned in the introduction, who wants to have her investigated in the middle of an election season. Gee, I wonder what the agenda here. I question the timing of all of this on the behalf --(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)By the way, David, you're supporting a candidate who is going to be on the fraud, he is up for fraud in November. He's going to be on trial for Trump University. You should worry about that a little more --WOHL: A civil suit, Alan? A civil suit. I'm not worried about a civil suit.COLMES: You should worry about that.WOHL: And by the way, we both agree that Loretta Lynch won't do anything as far as prosecuting Hillary Clinton. Could it possibly be that her boss has formally endorsed Hillary Clinton?COLMES: I don't know. Maybe it's a conflict there.REGAN: Maybe. All right. Guys, good to see you.COLMES: She's not acting because the FBI said there was no reason to indict. That's all.REGAN: Thank you, Alan. Thank you, David.Coming up, next, everyone, it's not just Trump. The media has it out for conservatives as a whole. Marc Thiessen and Rich Lowry are going to join us on that.Plus ""Time"" magazine and others proclaiming it's meltdown time for Donald Trump with several outlets reporting on a, quote, ""Come to Jesus meeting with the Republican National Committee."" Has the media gotten ahead of itself here? We have Howie Kurtz here tonight.Along with Dr. Ben Carson, Trump campaign insider. That's next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID GREGORY, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: You know, I've run out of words to express, you know, my shock and how completely beyond the pale that Donald Trump is.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)REGAN: Fresh reaction tonight to research suggesting newspapers are even more off kilter than television when it comes to balancing coverage of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The Media Research Center points to multiple headlines they deem double standards. ""The New York Times,"" Wednesday, in all caps blares, ""Trump's suggests gun owners act against Clinton. Alarm at his remarks.""From ""The Washington Post,"" ""Trump decries for gun remarks. Critics see his comments on Second Amendment as a threat against Clinton."" And from ""USA Today,"" ""Second Amendment people, his secret weapon, Trump hints.""Howie Kurtz has more live from our Washington Bureau. Howie.HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS MEDIA BUZZ SHOW HOST: Trish, if one image could capture the recent coverage of Donald Trump, it would be this ""Time"" magazine cover, ""Meltdown."" The media's more hostile approach began with Trump's speech at the republican convention.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What Donald Trump did tonight is a disgrace.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Republican Party that I worked for, for two decades died in this room tonight. We are now represented as a party by a man who believes in protectionism, isolationism, and nativism.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: The press also ripped Trump during the Democratic convention for what seemed a sarcastic invitation to Russian hackers to dig up Hillary Clinton's 33,000 deleted e-mails.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, I've run out of words to express, you know, my shock and how completely beyond the pale that Donald Trump is as a potential leader of the free world and commander-in-chief of our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Then came the media backlash when Trump criticized a Gold Star family after the Muslim father, Khizr Khan, denounced him at the Philadelphia convention. Some pundits even questioned his sanity. ""Washington Post"" columnist Gene Robinson calling Trump flat out crazy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It seems like a lot of people around him, even in his managerial inner circle, if that isn't a contradiction in terms, are wondering if not about his sanity, about his ability to control himself.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: There was another media uproar when the Republican nominee said Clinton, as president, would essentially abolish gun rights but that second amendment people might be able to do something.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Donald Trump spoke off the cuff and took his campaign off the rails, again.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let me say this to my Republican Party. You are -- you are letting Donald Trump destroy the party, and you've done it from the beginning.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: You don't say stuff like that. It can be seen otherwise, and it's not the press. It's not the Democrats. This is a self-inflicted wound.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: And Trump has been stepping up his own rhetorical assault on those who cover him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICEN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I would actually say that the media is almost as crooked as crooked Hillary Clinton. I mean that. I mean that.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: The question now, does Trump deserve the tidal wave of negative headlines or is there almost like of a bias against him? Trish.REGAN: I guess one of the worthwhile questions in all these Howie is at what point does it become a self-fulfilling prophecy. In other words, if there is a huge pile on effect and everyone is running headlines like you've seen in the ""Time"" cover that you referenced, then did that really sealed his fate?KURTZ: At some point, the sheer volume of all this Trump coverage -- not all of it negative, but a lot of it negative as you see, whether Donald Trump's invited some of it or not with some of his language -- becomes an imbalance in the way that he is covered versus Hillary Clinton.REGAN: All right, Howie, we're going to see you a little bit later on in the show. Thank you so much. Our next guest says all the controversies playing out right now around Donald Trump are due to the fact that the media has a bull's-eye on Mr. Trump's back.Dr. Ben Carson is joining me now. Dr. Carson, if the media indeed has set their targets on Trump, then might he want to maybe not do so many live rallies, so many unscripted events? I mean, should he be backing off this impromptu stuff?BEN CARSON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Not necessarily because, you know, this is really a battle between the establishment, the political establishment and Donald Trump, who is seen as an insurgent. And some of the political establishment is on the Republican side, too. They're not all on the Democrat side, but most of them are. And they've been working for a very long time to get to this point, and he threatens them.They need just one more term so they can get two to four Supreme Court picks and stack the federal court system, and then it really doesn't matter who is the president after that. They know that. And he is a huge threat to that. So they're going to pick apart everything that he has to say.And as long as they can talk about him all the time, they don't have to talk about Hillary because, my goodness, her negatives are through the roof. But if you never get to talk about them, then the people don't know about them.REGAN: You know, you see so many on the conservative side, the conservative elites that are also very critical of Donald Trump. Have they effectively sealed his fate as well? In other words, if they had embraced him earlier in this process more fully, might we be looking at a different situation in terms of some of the poll data we see?CARSON: Well, the fact of the matter is if the Republicans, the Conservatives, the people with common sense start working together, there is just no way the progressives can overcome them. The progressives know that, so they have to spend a lot of time and energy convincing the conservative group that there's a real problem here and that you can't really get behind this person, and then they're going to go home and laugh their heads off.You know, Conservatives and Republicans always seem to find a way to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. We cannot let it happen this time because we're talking about our children and our grandchildren. We're talking about the future of this nation. People have to get over their little things and look at the big picture here. This is huge.REGAN: You know, Dr. Carson, we're going to talk a little bit later in the show about how the media has treated conservatives all along, including Mitt Romney, but one of the common themes that you hear over and over again is that this person is unfit. They said Mitt Romney was unfit. They say Donald Trump is unfit. It seems to be a big talking point from the left. But as I look at this campaign, it has ratcheted up to a level that I don't think we've necessarily seen previously. Is that a fair assessment?CARSON: I think it's a fair assessment, but it's going to get a lot worse. If the polls begin to tighten or Donald Trump gets in front, you will see things that you've never seen before. They will pull out all the stops because like I said, there's a lot at stake for them, and they know that.Now, the media unfortunately has become complicit with the progressive movement, and my hope is that some of the young journalists will shake themselves free of the influence of those who are leading them astray and stand up with courage and say, you know.There's a reason that the press is protected by the constitution and we are going to stand with the people, and we're going to be objective. I don't care what's going on. We're going to ask the hard questions no matter who it is. I hope to see that.REGAN: Look, Dr. Carson, you're absolutely right. There needs to be more objectivity and so for the media to completely write him off this early in the game frankly just isn't following through on their obligations to be actual journalists in this whole process. Dr. Carson, thank you so much. Good to have you here.Donald Trump taking on the media again today. We will investigate his claims and analyze whether or not his battle with the press is helping or hurting his campaign.Plus we go back in time to dig up some of the media's worst attacks against GOP figures. Mark Thiessen and Rich Lowry are going to join me on that next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MITT ROMNEY, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You have the transcripts.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He did in fact sir so, let me -- let me call it an act of terror.ROMNEY: Can you say that a little louder, Candy.(END OF VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)REGAN: We're taking a closer look at Donald Trump's often cynical portrayal in the media over these past 14 months. But it's worth noting that Mr. Trump is in some ways just the latest in a long line of Republican president or nominees who have faced a somewhat hostile press. George w. Bush was called murderous and a fascist.John McCain was called intellectually shallow, and Mitt Romney was called unfit -- we've heard that one -- for office. Joining me right now with more Mark Thiessen, former chief speechwriter for President George W. Bush and resident fellow at American Enterprise Institute and Rich Lowry, editor of National Review, good to see you guys.MARK THIESSEN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE FELLOW: Hi, there.REGAN: You know, Mr. Thiessen, I want to start with you because you had to have confronted some of this head-on there as you were working for President Bush. What was your experience?THIESSEN: Oh, absolutely, we did. And look, I mean media bias is a fact of life for Republicans that we just have to live with. It's just like in the Olympics when the American athletes always knew that the Soviet judge was going to rule against them every time they could. It was just the rare fact of life. And you can recall just in the Bush administration how much press coverage there was of unfounded and now disputed -- and now proven wrong accusations that the Bush administration doctored intelligence on Iraq.Well, just this week, we have a report from Congress proving that the Obama -- under the Obama administration, Centcom doctored the intelligence on Iraq. There's almost no coverage of it or if you look at the 2012 campaign, Mitt Romney was made fun of for saying that Russia was our number one strategic enemy. They had all this fun with Obama saying the 1980s called, they want their foreign policy back. Now the media is beating up Donald Trump up for saying the opposite. So, they can't even be consistent in their bias.REGAN: I have a question for you Rich and you've experienced this obviously as the editor at National Review for many years as well. Why is it that so many people in the media are not objective, are actually that far to the left that I think many now feel as though it's their duty to influence the story in a way that hurts conservatives?RICH LOWRY, NATIONAL REVIEW EDITOR: Yeah, I think Trish it's even worse than that. There's an ingrained liberal culture in the media that's self- reinforcing and is so pervasive, a lot of journalists are biased without even realizing it because they swim in this ocean of liberalism. And, you know, everything that Mark said is correct. I think the most stark example though, was John McCain.He was beloved by the media his entire career. He would joke about how the media was actually his political base. And then as soon as he won the Republican nomination, the media viciously turned on him. So, this is not an unusual phenomenon that the press is so hostile to Donald Trump. But that doesn't mean that he should be reckless about it and constantly give them material, and I think the question you're asking Ben Carson a little earlier was very sound. Control your message at the rallies more. Do fewer interviews.REGAN: Don't give them the opportunity, right?LOWRY: This week should have been about two things, his economic speech and about those devastating Judicial Watch e-mails. Everything else is a loss for Donald Trump. But instead, we've had this nonsense conversation about various gaffes and controversies all week.REGAN: You talk about the institutional bias and I think that's very interesting, but I also, like Dr. Carson, question if that can change. I mean, he made the point that there are younger journalists that are coming into this field every day, and how is it that they're getting so entrenched, Mark, with what everyone else in the organization is telling them to do?THIESSEN: I think Rich is exactly right, that they swim in this pool of liberal bias and they don't even realize it. But the difference between then and now is that at least in the past, they used to feign objectivity. They used to pretend they were not biased. Today they've given up all pretense of not being biased. We just had front page story in ""The New York Times"" this weekend, by the media report of ""The New York Times"" who said, and I quote, ""Let's face it, balance has been on vacation since Trump stepped into his golden Trump Tower escalator last year to announce his candidacy,"" and he defended it.He said many reporters think that Donald Trump will be dangerous for the country and so therefore, if you think Donald Trump is dangerous you have to -- that has to affect your coverage. So, they're not even pretending to be objective anymore.REGAN: And he said coming clean.LOWRY: They're patting themselves on the back for being biased.REGAN: Wow, that's how crazy it has gotten, right?THIESSEN: Exactly, on the front page of ""The New York Times.""REGAN: You guys, it's so good to see you. Thank you so much.THIESSAEN: Thanks, Trish.REGAN: All right. Plus, a new narrative emerging from today's headlines. Donald Trump is continuing to look as those he is highly challenged in this race. We have many polls out saying that it's going to be an uphill battle and you have seen a number of media organizations really reflect a bias and that they are saying it is over. Is it really over? It ain't over till it's over, right? As we always say. Howie Kurtz is going to shine a spotlight on these allegations of media bias. That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)REGAN: On the campaign trail today, Donald Trump rehashing his fight with the media. Mr. Trump's allegations of unfair coverage, they started almost immediately after he announced his bid for the White House back in June 2015. And since then, the billionaire businessman has called many in the media, quote, """"dishonest and part of a rigged system that is working against him and his supporters."" Fox News host of ""Media Buzz,"" Howie Kurtz investigated these claims and he joins us right now with his report, Howie.KURTZ: Trish, from the moment Donald Trump got into the presidential race, much of the media mocked or minimized his chances. A loud-mouth New York billionaire beating all those Senators and governors? Really? New York's ""Daily News"" depicted Trump as a clown. ""The Huffington Post"" relegated all Trump stories to its entertainment section. And most pundits dismissed him as a summer fling.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think this is Donald Trump's biggest day, and he will be ignored from henceforth.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And we better be ready for the fact that he might be leading the Republican ticket.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I know you don't believe that, but I want to go on.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: But the laughter faded as Trump all but clinched the nomination. ""New York Times"" columnist David Brooks says he was surprised by Trump's success because he spent too much time with affluent professionals like himself.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID BROOKS, NEW YORK TIMES COLUMNIST: I didn't think -- not only did I not think he would win. Now, I didn't think he was really running for president. I thought he was trying to drum up some kind of publicity for himself.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Now, with Trump slipping in the polls, much of the media is again suggesting or flat out predicting that he can't beat Hillary Clinton. The Republican nominee meanwhile practically made press bashing part of his platform. He skipped a Fox News debate while feuding with Megyn Kelly. He yanked the press credentials of such media outlets as the ""Washington Post"" and ""Politico"" and now refuses to appear on CNN and MSNBC.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We're going to punch through the media. We have to. ""The New York Times"" is totally dishonest, totally dishonest. And CNN, boy does CNN -- it's like all Trump, all the time -- all Trump, all the time. You walk out of an interview, you said, that was a good interview, and then you get killed for the rest of the weekend.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: That kind of tough talk fired up his base during the primaries. But in the general election it's not clear whether Trump is being damaged by the constant warfare with the media, Trish.REGAN: Well, you know, the one question I'd have Howie is why the heck is the media not spending more time on the actual policy that would actually be meaningful to our country? I mean, here we are talking about the horse race all the time, all the things that Donald Trump does. But nobody out there -- aside, I would point out, from us, because we do dive into this policy -- but they're not out there talking about his economic platform. It's almost as though they're afraid to.KURTZ: Well, the press is addicted to polls and flap of the day and insults and all of that. But what's happened now is that day by day, hour by hour really, you have all of these controversies swirling around Trump. Some of them media-generated and some of them self-generated and very little devoted to Hillary Clinton, who I think is deliberately trying to make little news and let the media and Trump box it out in the ring.KURTZ: I mean, it's been 252 days since she had a press conference, so she is certainly is trying to stay out of the headlines and perhaps let him grab the spotlight for attention that she doesn't want. Howie, stay with me. Joining our conversation with Howie Kurt, we have Nely Galan. She is the former president of entertainment for Telemundo and the author of the New York Times bestselling book, ""Self Made."" Nely, good to have you here and forgive me, it's Galan.I do want to ask you, you know, it's been remarkable and that we've seen a tremendous shift, I think, in how politics is done, the politicking if you would, of this campaign in that Donald Trump's out there tweeting. He's out there, you know, on various media channels talking to his supporters and getting his base excited. Does this mean that going forward, there is going to be a real shift in accessibility of politicians?NELY GALAN, TELEMUNDO FORMER PRESIDENT FOR ENTERTAINMENT: Well, I think so. I mean, look, he is a TV person. I mean, I was on ""Celebrity Apprentice"" with him. He's someone who knows how to be scandalous and we have -- the public love scandal and love arguing and everything we're talking about today in the media, I mean it's all changed because he is the first real TV personality president.REGAL: Yes, but its one thing, right. It's one thing to have scandal on a reality TV show. It's another thing to have scandal when you're running for president.GALAN: That's right. And I think, you know, as someone who just wrote a book about women and Latinas being the emerging market and the fastest growing entrepreneurs, I feel like he's missed the boat on talking about women like me, and he's not talking to us. So, we're sitting here, going, oh, my gosh. All this scandal and you're right, we're not talking about the facts. We're not talking about the public that's out there that really wants real things talked about.REGAL: We need to spend time on that policy because there's a lot of meaty stuff for us to all chew into. Thank you so much. Good to have you here Nely and Howie. We're going to be right back with more ""Kelly File"" after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)REGAL: Love to hear from you. Go to facebook.com/thekellyfile and tell me what you thought of tonight show. Thank you so much for watching. I am Trish Regan in for Megyn Kelly tonight. This is ""The Kelly File."" I will see you on the Fox Business Network at 2:00 p.m., ""The Intelligence Report"" where I am every day. I'll see you there on Monday and back here on Monday night. Have a greet weekend.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I don't care how beautiful the wall is.  It's a big -- it's a beautiful wall.  We will build it the wall across -- the wall looks fabulous.  It will have a door in the middle of it.  And the door will open and close.  And the good people will go in and the bad people come out.  And it will be a beautiful wall and have my name on it.  Everybody will love it.  It will be a great wall.  (LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)NEIL CAVUTO, ANCHOR:  All right, who knew that Christie could do such a dead- on Donald Trump impression, if you think that's a dead-on Donald Trump impression?Welcome back, everybody.Joined right now by another billionaire who is not in the race, at least not yet, but Mark Cuban, who has zinged his fellow billionaire, but, anyway, a lot to get into with Mark.Mark, good to have you.MARK CUBAN, CO-FOUNDER, HDNET:  Thanks for having me, Neil.  I'm excited about this.  CAVUTO:  All right, when you were asked about who you like in this race, I think you had said ABC, you know, anyone but Cruz.  You're referring to Ted Cruz. So, does that mean you were open on Donald Trump?CUBAN:  Yes, I think Donald is softening up some.  I have talked to him on the phone a couple of times, and like everybody you have had on, when you know Donald, he has kind of a different personality than what he plays on TV.  And it's kind of don't hate the player, hate the game type situation.  But I haven't made a decision yet.  But I will consider anybody but Ted Cruz.  CAVUTO:  What do you think is going on here with his popularity, Donald Trump's popularity?  Everyone waiting for him to stumble.  We just had a guest on very big in the evangelical community who thinks he will stumble.   He hasn't yet.  What do you think is going on here?  CUBAN:  I think people are sick of Washington.  People are sick of the way things work in Washington.And from all of the candidates, we have really not seen any leadership, whether it's what they have done in their governorships or as senators, what their stated plans are as candidates.  And the thing about Trump is, whether you like him or not, he comes across as being strong, he comes across as being a leader.  And there's something to be said that someone who gets buildings with his name built, someone who has been successful in business is able to accomplish things.And so when you look at a list of candidates on both sides the aisle and you say, have any of them really accomplished anything, the answer is no.   And so when you look at Donald, you say, you know what?  I may not agree with his policies.  And I have said this directly to him.  I said, Donald, I don't agree with a lot of what you're saying, but at least you're the one person that has been able to go out there and get something done and show some accomplishment in their life, and other than this bill or that bill passed or stopped.So, I think people recognize that he has accomplished things and they're rallying behind that.  CAVUTO:  You know, there's always talk about his passionate followers, those who show up for events, but others say they're like curiosity- seekers.  They're not going to do what they have to do in a caucus state like this, Mark, where, A, you have to know the precinct you have to go to, and then agree to stick around there for a while.And if up to the half of the voters are first-timers doing this, they're not going to like that, and his friends or fans might not stick around.   What do you make of that?CUBAN:  I think it's very true.  And I think it's a real possibility.  But let me add to that.  In the NBA, we have this whole long preseason, we have the whole summer to add players, free agents, and that's very analogous to what is going on right now.CAVUTO:  Right.  CUBAN:  And then you play the first game of the season and it seems like it's almost a championship game because everybody has been so excited.  And there's so much buildup.But it's the same -- it's analogous to what is going on in Iowa.  Iowa doesn't really determine who is going to win.  Iowa just really determines what the playbook's going to be for media and maybe strategically how some of the plans are going to play out for some of the candidates.So while I agree with you that there's a real risk in a caucus environment that they turn into curious-seekers or celebrity followers and they don't follow through and give Donald a win, I don't think it matters.  I think, if anything, it will really motivate him to be stronger elsewhere.   And then from there, it just comes down to, can he execute on his business plan, on his ground game?  CAVUTO:  I think one thing that people miss in covering this whole thing is, they make it a right or left thing within the Republican Party, Mark, that who is more right than the other, more conservative than the other, when, in fact, given the sentiment I'm seeing out of evangelical voters, for example, I think it's an angry thing.  I think it's a get something done thing.  CUBAN:  Absolutely.  CAVUTO:  I don't think it's really defined by, is this candidate conservative than the other?  I think we have got this -- one thing I told my staff is, we have this big old inbox in our country that is filled with stuff that is not getting done.People want that stuff out of that inbox and getting worked on and done.   And I don't think they're paying as much attention to the politics of the person as much as the ability to clear out that inbox and get stuff done.  CUBAN:  Yes, I think you're exactly right.  People are tired of labels.  That's one of the reasons I don't like Ted Cruz.  Everything he says is defined by some sort of label, whereas, with Donald, agree or disagree -- I said it right from the day he came out.  You may not like what he says, but the way he says it is forceful and powerful and will get people's attention.  And I agree with you.CAVUTO:  But is it that simple?  The rap against him, Mark, is that he makes it seem almost too simple.  We had a bite of Chris Christie parroting, I'm going to build a wall, the Mexicans are going to pay for it, I'm going to make this country great again without spelling out exactly how he does so.Now, he hasn't been penalized in the polls for those generalities.   Eventually, he would have to be, or at least spell them out.  Right?   CUBAN:  Well, yes, you're right, but let's put it in context, right?Is there anything that any candidate has said on either side that is realistic?  Tax cut plans, all nonsense, right?  Hillary is going to -- or Bernie Sanders going to pay for everybody's college.  Can't happen.  Right?  When you look at the list of things that everybody has proposed, none of them are realistic. So, if none of them are realistic, and people don't trust the labels, then the person who is the most forceful and really the person who can come across the best way and simplify things has the best chance.  It is the old KISS concept, keep it simple, stupid.  And I think Donald is really dialed in on that and understands it.  And he will admit it.CAVUTO:  Let me add then to that point.  You're a pretty successful businessman, a pretty good read of markets, et cetera.  You have seen how volatile they have been this year, whether they're presaging or coming attractions for a slowdown, an outright recession.What would it take to goose things?  Republicans, by and large, propose lower taxes.  Democrats, by and large, propose more spending.  What do you think?  CUBAN:  I think what is missing across the board and why I haven't chosen who I'm going to vote for is that we need somebody who has leadership skills and has the ability to define what they can do.  So, for instance, no one talks about the specifics about anything related to the economy right now.  Now, I get that it's very difficult for a president to have influence and really have a great impact on the economy, but at least come up with something.  And Donald has not really talked about his business side at all, but either has anybody else.  And simply saying that we're going to cut taxes, that's not enough.  That's the old pabulum that everybody on the Republican side has been throwing out for years.You have got to be more specific.  Are you going to change patent laws?   Are you going to go in and increase the number of IPOs by changing the SEC?   Are you going to go back to Glass-Steagall?  Are you going to go and make it easier to create businesses so there is less paperwork and we see an increase in entrepreneurship?There's a thousand things that people -- that are specific that candidates could talk about them -- that candidates could talk about, but none of them do.  And I think that's part of the problem.  CAVUTO:  You know, the singer Adele apparently got annoyed at Governor Mike Huckabee and later Donald Trump for using her songs, in the case of Huckabee, in an ad, and in the case of Trump, at any one of his rallies.  Trump has still been playing her various songs, despite the Adele folks saying cease and desist.  What do you think of that, when an entertainer does that?  I don't know how it works at a basketball game.(CROSSTALK)CUBAN:  Yes.  The only word is ironic, and here's why.  Because there's a rapper named Mac Miller who happens to be from Pittsburgh, where I grew up.  And he did a song called ""Donald Trump,"" and Donald went nuts.  Sued him for including his name.  So, look, Adele has the right to control her own songs.  She owns the copyright.  It's her deal.  So I don't have a problem with it, but I just enjoy the irony of Donald fighting back, when he fought Mac Miller.  CAVUTO:  All right.  Well, still, Adele hasn't gotten back to me.  We wanted to get her view on this.We know you're connected with that community.  Can you please have her call me to get to her?(LAUGHTER)CUBAN:  I will call her.  I will call her.  CAVUTO:  Because I don't understand what is going on.  All you have to do is pick up the phone and say hello.CUBAN:  But I will say this one thing, though.The parodies -- the parodies that have come out, Neil, there's nothing that she can do about those.  So, if Donald were to do a parody, like Mike Huckabee did a parody, that's all within the copyright laws.  She cannot say or do anything at all.CAVUTO:  I would think so, too, but Huckabee stopped it.  He stopped it.   He didn't want to deal with it.(CROSSTALK)CUBAN:  He didn't have to.  Yes, he didn't have to.  CAVUTO:  Yes.  OK.  Mark, thank you very much for joining us.  Best of luck.  CUBAN:  It's always fun, Neil.  I appreciate it.  And enjoy Iowa.  CAVUTO:  All right, I will.  It's a beautiful state, Mark Cuban.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.CHRIS WALLACE, HOST:  I'm Chris Wallace.  Police officers targeted as anti-cop rhetoric reaches new lows.  What can ease the tensions?  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BLACK LIVES MATTER DEMONSTRATORS:  Pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon.  Pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We've heard black lives matter.  All lives matter.  Well, cops' lives matter, too.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  At some point in time, you got to the stop yelling and screaming, and start listening and discussing WALLACE:  We'll discuss the deadly attacks on police as well as rising murder rates in major American cities with two top cops.  Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, and Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn.  Then, President Obama gets enough votes in Congress to ensure his nuclear deal with Iran will take effect.  We'll talk with former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz about that and an Obama foreign policy they say has dangerously weakened America.  And we'll ask our Sunday panel about Donald Trump's change of mind.  DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party. WALLACE:  All, right now, on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  And hello again from Fox News in Washington.  Like a lot of people, we noticed a deeply disturbing trend this week.  A policeman gunned down north of Chicago became the 24th law enforcement officer murdered in the line of duty this year.  Since Ferguson last August, 44 officers have been shot and killed.  And this comes at a time of growing anti-police rhetoric and a spike in murders in some of our biggest cities.  We're joined today by two leaders in law enforcement.  Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey and Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn.  Chief Flynn, you said recently, every cop in America is looking over his shoulder and they don't feel that America has their back.  Is that contributing to this rash of police shootings?  EDWARD FLYNN, MILWAUKEE POLICE CHIEF:  I think we have to look at a broader context.  I certainly think it's an element.  A number of things have happened.  I'm wondering as we look at both the police shooting phenomenon and the increase in homicides in our major cities, you can't disaggregate these two phenomenon.  And I think there's a number of variables at work that we might be able to discuss later that have to do with us being at some sort of tipping point.We're not sure if we've got a spike or a real tipping point and a change phenomenon.  But there are some concerning issues.  And one of them is the relentless propaganda war being waged against American police officers by our network television stations.  It's been most distressing to watch them try to link six or eight questionable video recordings of police misconduct and turn that into a national narrative of what the state of police community relations are.  It's a false construct, but it is a dangerous one.  WALLACE:  OK, we'll get into that in a moment.  Commissioner Ramsey, let's talk about the problem you faced firsthand this week.  You were trying to talk about police/community relations in Philadelphia, and you in effect were shouted down by protesters of the Black Lives Matter movement.  Here's a clip.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BLACK LIVES MATTER DEMONSTRATORS:  No racist!  Police!  No racist!  Police!  No racist!  Police!  What do you want?  Justice.  When do you want it?  Now.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Commissioner, when you see that and those protesters in Minneapolis chanting ""pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon,"" does that contribute to this sense that it's open season on cops?  CHARLES RAMSEY, PHILADELPHIA POLICE COMMISSIONER:  Well, it certainly doesn't help.  I think it's ignorant to do things like that.  I also think that you know, the people that are serious in this movement are missing an opportunity to really make a difference.  If all you want to do is get up during a meeting and yell and scream and shout and then walk out, then you're not going to get too far because there's no opportunity for dialogue.  I mean, there are a lot of issues that are driving crime in our neighborhoods.  It's not just about policing and how policing is conducted.  You've got very, very serious issues taking place that's driving crime.  I mean, that's why police are there to begin with.  If they want to really deal with the issue of black lives and the number of homicides that take place, then you have to look at the crime that takes place on the streets of our city -- black on black crime.  If you don't address that, if you don't address the drivers of crime, then this is going just not result in anything at all positive.  WALLACE:  But there clearly has been something of a breakdown or at least a worsening of the situation between police and the communities that they're trying to protect.  Chief Flynn, you were in a situation last November.  You were at a hearing about a police officer who had shot and killed a disturbed man.  And some of the protesters there criticized you for looking at your phone during the hearing, and you made some comments that went viral.  Here they are.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FLYNN:  I was following developments with a 5-year-old little girl sitting on her dad's lap who just got shot in the head by a drive-by shooting.  And if some of the people here gave a good goddamn about the victimization of people in this community by crime, I'd take some of their invective more seriously.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Chief, does that embody a breakdown in trust between the police and the people in the inner cities?  FLYNN:  I think one of the great myths is there is some dramatic breakdown in trust between the people at the grassroots level and the police.  It's a canard.  You know, every time there's a critical incident involving the police, some self-styled activist that I've never met before or ever seen at a community meeting is suddenly all over the TV running their mouth off against racist oppression in the police department.  If you can get 40 people at the demonstration, I can guarantee you four TV cameras and a news helicopter.  But the reality is, day after day after day, our coppers are in those neighborhoods not just literally protecting people with their lives, but in the meetings, organizing communities, listening to problems and providing the services they want.  What we have is the historical challenge of the neighborhoods and communities that need quality policing.  Most for historic reasons have been harboring some level of distrust.  At the grass-roots level, those relationships are much, much healthier than any national network would have you believe.  WALLACE:  OK.  You have talked about this and let's address it head-on this question of whether or not it's the media and maybe some politicians who are exploiting a few isolated incidents.  Chief Ramsey, there certainly have been a series of incidents over the last year.  You can say it's not a lot but they have been dramatic.  A lot of them recorded on body cams, showing police acting recklessly or their original stories didn't match-up to what actually happened.  You have a case like that in Philadelphia.  Don't police actions add to some of the mistrust?  RAMSEY:  Sure there's no question about that.  But the problem is when that becomes the only thing shown, and there are hundreds of thousands of interactions that occur between police and community every single day that you don't know about because they absolutely went well.We've taken 2,000 guns off the streets of Philadelphia without a shot being fired by a police officer.  Now, these are illegal guns being carried by a person.  Those arrests are made.  No one is injured.  I mean, nobody talks about that sort of thing.So, I think that it really does distort the view of what's going on in policing.  We've got some issues that we've got to address.  We've got police officers that engage in misconduct.  But when the only thing that gets shown is that shooting that is bad, I had an officer that was murdered on March 5th of this year.  There's video of that which we will not show because we don't want to expose the family or anybody else to it.  Those are the dangers that police officers face every day that gets overshadowed by the few incidents of misconduct.  WALLACE:  There it is and we alluded to it at the very beginning, another side to this story, Chief Flynn.  In major cities across the country, the murder rate and take a look at, it has risen dramatically from what it was at the same type last year.  In your city of Milwaukee, murders are up 76 percent.  Chief, how do you explain it?  FLYNN:  The question we have to look at is what are the variables right now?  You know, when you think of the concept of a tipping point, you're thinking of the environment, you're think of the few people that make maximum impact and what are the changes that have brought on this phenomenon because you end up with a sudden increase, not a gradual increase.  And what we've seen right now I think is the same percentage of the criminal population, which is 6 percent to 9 percent, is again driving this crime rate but a number of us have suffered from recently weakened gun laws that have made it much, much easier for our criminals to gain access to firearms.  When the major cities mate a few weeks ago here in D.C., all of us noticed the phenomena a lot more rounds are being fired at each shooting and overwhelmingly, our homicides are being driven by people with criminal records shooting people with criminal records.  And that's the slice that's really driving our homicide rates. WALLACE:  There is another theory, commissioner.  And that is the so-called Ferguson effect.  And that's the argument that with police feeling they're being targeted either in the media or out on street and with emboldened criminals that police are not going into neighborhoods as aggressively as they used to.  And one of the case examples people cite rightly or wrongly is Baltimore, where six police officers were indicted after the death of Freddie Gray.  Do you think there is a Ferguson effect?  RAMSEY:  Well, I mean, Baltimore's kind of a unique situation with what took place there.  I haven't seen it in Philadelphia.  Now, that's not to say we don't have some officers that perhaps are not as aggressive as they were before.  But it certainly -- when you look at our numbers, it certainly is no indication that's the case.  We have a slight bump in homicides, 5 percent.  But we stay on top of it. And I think it's also important to keep this in context.  We've had historically low numbers in terms of homicides and shootings for several years now.  And so, our numbers are being compared to that and we're starting to have an upward trend which is something to be very, very concerned about, we don't want to go in that direction.  But I also think it's important to remember just exactly what we're being compared to.  There is a problem out there.  No question about it.  Certainly, Ferguson has had an impact on us in policing.  To what extent, I don't know.  WALLACE:  Like everything else, this has become political, as well.  Critics note, Chief Flynn, that President Obama seems to speak out more emotionally and more vocally when young black men are shot down like Trayvon Martin or Michael Brown than when policemen are shot.  Do cops notice that?  FLYNN:  Oh, I think the president is missing a historic opportunity and which is to bridge the gap between the two parallel conversations going on right now.  On the one hand, we have the conversation about the holocaust of homicidal violence that's afflicting poor neighborhoods of color.  You know, in my city, the homicide rate for an African-American is 185 per 100,000 compared to 50 for a white person, OK?  It's a dramatic difference true in city after city after city.  At the same time -- WALLACE:  This is black on black crime.  FLYNN:  That's correct.  WALLACE:  This isn't policeman --  FLYNN:  No.WALLACE:  This isn't white people going on, this is black on black.FLYNN:  And the challenge is that these neighborhoods are afflicted by high rates of homicidal violence and nonfatal shootings and other crimes, and the police are trying to do something about it with them.  On the other hand, you have disparities in the criminal justice system and the parallel conversation that has to be bridges is you can't talk disparities in the system unless you talk about disparities of victimization.  One person could bridge that gap most effectively.  So far, he's only talked about half the equation and I would like to see a change in it.  WALLACE:  Chief Flynn, Commissioner Ramsey, thank you both.  Thanks for coming in.  We will, of course, stay on top of the story.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Up next, a Kentucky county clerk chooses to go to jail rather than bend on same-sex marriage.  Our Sunday group weighs in on that and the race for the White House.  Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the Hillary Clinton aide who says he will take the Fifth over setting up her private e-mail server?  Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and we may use your question on the air.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Under whose authority are you not issuing licenses?  KIM DAVIS, KENTUCKY COUNTY CLERK:  Under God's authority.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Did God tell you to do this?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Did God tell you to threat us like this?  DAVIS:  I've asked you all to leave.  You are interrupting my business.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Well, someone finally took the spotlight from the Donald Trump this week.  Kim Davis, a county clerk in Kentucky, defied a court order to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and went to jail.  Time to bring in our Sunday group: syndicated columnist George Will, Susan Page, Washington bureau chief of ""USA Today"", Robert Costa from ""The Washington Post"", and ""New York Times"" bestselling author Richard North Patterson has written thrillers on a range of topics, including politics and the Supreme Court.  Well, that clerk Kim Davis says that God's law outweighs man's law.  The Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage and a number of Republican presidential candidates including Ted Cruz and Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee jumped on her bandwagon.  George, your thoughts about the principle and politics of the rule of law and also, what about Barack Obama who seems to sometimes pick and choose which laws he's going to enforce?  GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST:  Well, there's no question that the president's selective interpretation of the constitutional provision that the executive shall see that the laws are faithfully executed, his selective approach to that perhaps has encouraged a kind of lawlessness down the ballot.  People are saying, ""Well, I can do whatever I wish.""But surely it is a wholesome rule that executives should obey legitimate court orders.  That's true whether your name is Orval Faubus, the Democratic governor of Arkansas in the 1950s, or George Wallace, the Democratic governor of Alabama in the '60s, or Kim Davis, the Democratic county clerk in Kentucky.  She made a choice.  She -- unquestionably, her faith is important to her.  Evidently, her paycheck is also because she did not resign her office.  We've been here before, Chris.  In 1892, a Massachusetts policeman claimed that his constitutional rights of speech and association had been violated by rules governing and restricting political activity by police.  The supreme judicial court of Massachusetts head against him in an opinion written by a Massachusetts judge named Oliver Wendell Holmes, he ruled, he said the policeman has a constitutional right to engage in politics, the policeman does not have a constitutional right to be a policeman.  She has that same problem.  WALLACE:  Rick, as we've been following the story, I keep thinking that Kim Davis could be a character in one of your novels -- sworn to uphold the law but arguing that there's a higher law.  RICHARD NORTH PATTERSON, NYT BEST-SELLING AUTHOR:  Well, I think the problem here is that -- George is exactly right.  This is no different than her turning down an interracial couple on religious grounds.  It's a public official.  Somebody doesn't have the right to do it. The real problem I think is a manner of parochial politics.  This one revivifies the controversy which the Supreme Court protects the GOP from by ruling in favor of gay rights.  Now, Kim Davis has thrown them back in the briar patch.  It separates the people willing to be grown-ups from the folks seeking is out parochial, political advantaging in Iowa among evangelicals.  The problem is that's not where the American people are so the GOP should hope this goes away as quickly as possible.  WALLACE:  Well, let's talk about the GOP and let's turn to Donald Trump who this week finally signed a loyalty oath pledging he'll support the Republican nominee and not run as an independent candidate.  Here's a clip.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  I will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  But there's a question, Robert.  Did the Republicans win or lose by in a sense with the RNC chairman Reince Priebus flying up to New York, going to the Trump Tower, seeming to formally take Donald Trump into the GOP?  ROBERT COSTA, THE WASHINGTON POST:  It's a political chess game.  On one side, the RNC is trying to bring him into the tent to make sure she's not a threat for a third party run.  At the same time, I've spoken to Trump and his campaign manager about this.  They believe long-term they can get other Republicans to commit to him to be botched in as much as he is botched in with this pledge should he be the no knee.  He thinks he needs to start making a move in case he actually does win the nomination, people stick with him.  WALLACE:  But there's another aspect of it, Bob, and that is that to a certain degree, he was the outsider.  He was, you know, the maverick.  But now with his signing the pledge and having the laying on off of hands of Priebus, does the GOP own his statements more than they did in?COSTA:  They do own Trump more because Priebus went up to New York and associated with Trump.  Previously, he didn't appear with Trump at the press conference.  At the same time, the RNC is trying to get a hold of the situation, this phenomenon.  When you see Carson's rise, Trump's rise, Carly Fiorina, all these outsider voices are becoming a major part of the party and the institutional GOP is grappling with exactly what to do.They don't have many tools.  This is one of them.  It's just a political document.  WALLACE:  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton's e-mail problems continue.  She refuse this week to say she was sorry for what had happened, refused to apologize, but she did say this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  There was so much work to be done.  We had so many problems around the world.  I didn't really stop and think what kind of e-mail system will there be.  I am sorry that this has been confusing to people and has raised a lot of questions.  (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  And we got a lot of questions from you about the decision of a State Department staffer whom Hillary Clinton paid to help set up her e-mail server or private e-mail server in Chappaqua, New York.  His decision, his announcement that he is going to take the Fifth Amendment in all investigations of this.And you can see -- here's one of the questions, Phil Mayfield sent us on Facebook, ""If the panel offers immunity to that staffer, can the aide be compelled to testify or risk being charged with contempt of congress?  SUSAN PAGE, USA TODAY:  Absolutely.  If they offer him immunity, he doesn't have a Fifth Amendment right not to testify, he will be forced to testify.  I assume he would testify as opposed to going to jail and, Richard, you talked about being thrown back into the briar patch when it comes to gay marriage.  Hillary Clinton cannot get out of the briar patch that is this e-mail controversy.  One thing unpersuasive about her answering the clip that you just showed was if she had not time to think through her e-mail system, wouldn't she have used the State Department system that was in place?  This is a controversy that is not going away.  It's going to be here for months and it is costing her dearly in two ways -- in her reputation as an honest and trustworthy person, but also in her ability to talk about some other issue.  WALLACE:  And what do you think about the fact that this fellow, Bryan Pagliano, says that he's going to take the Fifth?  Hillary Clinton saying there's not wrong, there's nothing unethical, there's nothing improper, certainly nothing illegal.  And here's a guy who's taking the Fifth against self-incrimination.  PAGE:  We discovered just yesterday I think with The Washington Post story he was being paid personally by the Clintons to maintain this e-mail server.  It's something that we didn't know before.  Now, maybe there's nothing wrong with that, but it's an example of exactly the opposite of what you're supposed to do when you face a political problem like this.Rule one: get the whole story out there.  Deal with it.  Say you're sorry.  Maybe you apologize and move on.  And Hillary has failed do those very basic, kind of political 101 steps on this controversy.  WALLACE:  George, we seem to sort of give a temperature here every week.  Is Hillary Clinton in better or worse shape on the email scandal at the end of this week?  WILL:  Worse, because they're paying this person, absent-mindedly?  She was saying, well, I was so caught up in fixing relations with Russia that I absent-mindedly set up an alternative e-mail system?  It doesn't pass the laugh test.  COSTA:  If she's so crippled by this, I wonder where is Vice President Biden?  He's still on the sidelines.  You have a lot of Democrats, Senator Sanders, Governor O'Malley, resisting to take negative shots at Secretary Clinton.  You still have a Democratic Party, for all her struggles, is pretty much behind her and people are reluctant to get in and really make that a battle.  WALLACE: So, I mean, are you -- what are you saying then, I mean, in terms of press --  (CROSSTALK)COSTA:  I'm saying this is an issue perhaps -- when I talk to Republican campaigns, they say this is going to be an issue in the general election.  We feel like we're seeing on this more.  I think with the Benghazi hearings, it will do even more.  But with the Democrats, when you're on the trail and you're in Iowa and New Hampshire, Democrats are still not really thinking this is a big issue for her.  WALLACE:  Rick, we're friends from Martha's Vineyard, that bastion of liberalism.  What are your friends saying about Hillary Clinton and this e-mail thing?  Is it just a vast right wing conspiracy?  PATTERSON:  Well, I think what Robert says is right.  I think it's a general election problem.  She's very solid in the Democratic base -- among women, among labor, among minorities, everyone but white progressives.  And as Gene McCarthy and George McGovern learned, white progressives aren't enough.So, I think Robert is correct.  This is a general election problem.  Whatever else, it plays in the problem of perception like Dan Quayle not being able to be spell potato, this is plays into troupe of her opponents that she's entitled and untrustworthy and that's a difficulty.  WALLACE:  And then there's also the FBI investigation, which might take on a whole lift on its own.All right.  We have to take a break.  We'll see you all a little bit later.  Up next, President Obama secures enough support to get his nuclear Iran deal through Congress.  We'll sit down with former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz who say it's another example of Mr. Obama's disastrous foreign policy. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: A look outside the beltway at Independence Hall in Philadelphia.  Meanwhile, here in Washington, President Obama got the votes he'll need to ensure Congress won't be able to block his controversial nuclear deal with Iran.  That victory for the White House is bad news for two of the president's toughest foreign policy critics, former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz, a former assistant secretary of state.  They have the written a new book, ""Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America."" And welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday.""  DICK CHENEY, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT:  It's good to be back, Chris.  LIZ CHENEY, FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE:  Mr. Vice President, in your book, you compare Obama's deal to Neville Chamberlain, appeasing Hitler in Munich in 1938.  Really?  D. CHENEY:  Yes.  No, I -- if you look at what happened with respect to the Iranian deal, the only winner are the Iranians.  They got everything they asked for.  The losers are the United States, are the friends and allies of the United States, and the region, Israelis, the Saudis and others.  The overall outcome I think will be to shift significantly the balance of power in that part of the world to the Iranians.  I think they'll end up dominating partly not because of the nuclear deal, but also because of the lifting of the embargo on ballistic missiles and on conventional weapons.So, I think it's a big deal, a major, major defeat in my mind in terms of our position in the region.  WALLACE:  But Secretary of State Kerry says if the U.S. backs out now, that our European allies and the U.N. will lift their sanctions and we'll be all alone.  Here's a clip.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE:  It is clear that if we reject this plan, the multilateral sanctions regime will start to unravel, the pressure on Iran will lessen, and our negotiating leverage will diminish, if not disappear.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Liz, Kerry says that there's no chance for negotiating a better deal.  L. CHENEY:  Well, you know, Secretary Kerry may not have been able to negotiate a better deal.  But in fact, what they're saying now is totally disingenuous.  We know the sanctions were working.  We know they were starting to bite.  When we were -- my dad and I were in the Middle East about a year ago, we had leaders there saying specifically, the sanctions are working.  Why are you relieving pressure now?  So, now you have a situation where having conceded the most important things including the right for the Iranians to enrich, the Obama administration is saying if you don't vote for this deal, we'll have war.  The reality is, because of the pathway to a nuclear arsenal the deal provides, because of the other concessions with respect to conventional weapons and missiles and funding, this deal makes more likely, not less likely.  WALLACE:  Mr. Vice President, you say that President Obama never put a serious nuclear option on the table, but you and President Bush, the Bush/Cheney administration dealt with Iran for eight years.  And I think it's fair to say that there was never any real serious military threat.  And during your time, let's put these numbers up on the screen, Iran went from zero known centrifuges in operation to more than 5,000.  So in fairness, didn't you leave the Bush Cheney administration leave President Obama with a mess? D. CHENEY:  Well, I don't think of it that way.  In fact, there was military action that had an impact on the Iranians, when we took down Saddam Hussein.  There was a period of time when they stopped their program because they were afraid of what we did to Saddam we were going to do to them next.  We also, when we took down Saddam, Moammar Gadhafi surrendered up his nuclear program.  When we got that, then went and got his suppler, Mr. A.Q. Khan.  We did a lot to limit nuclear proliferation in the region while we were there.WALLACE:  But the centrifuges went from zero to 5,000.  D. CHENEY:  Well, and they well have gone, but that happened on Obama's watch, not on our watch.  WALLACE:  No, no, by 2009, they were at 5,000. D. CHENEY:  Right.  But I think we did a lot to deal with the arms control problem in the Middle East.  We signed on with the -- our international friends and allies and the Europeans and started the negotiations process.  So what we did not do is what Obama did.  He never had a military option on the table.  He talked about it repeatedly, but nobody believed him especially after he waffled on the Syrian deal.  There never was a military option that the Iranians had to worry about.  So, the situation also involved he was paying cash to the Iranians to get them just to come to the table.  He was making -- lifting sanctions just to get them to come to the table.  He always dealt from a position of weakness which I don't think we would have done.L. CHENEY:  Also, programs under way which have been reported in the press about which people can't speak that had an impact covertly on the Iranian program according to press reports during the Bush administration.  Which were leaked during the Obama administration.  WALLACE:  You talk -- well, you can't talk about it, but I mean I assume you're talking about cyberwarfare, (INAUDIBLE)] ...(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  ... things like that.  Some of that also happened in the Obama administration, as well.  Let's talk -- let's move to Iraq and the rise of ISIS.  Liz, you blame President Obama for pulling all U.S. troops out of Iraq in 2011, but the fact is the original status of forces agreement that called for the withdrawal of all troops was negotiated by President Bush and critics would argue that the rise of al Qaeda and other terrorists in Iraq started after the invasion of Iraq in 2003 by the Bush/Cheney administration.  L. CHENEY:  Well, the reality is that there was always an intention that there would be stay behind forces and that once the combat operations were over, there would be an agreement and another sofa agreement negotiated to allow forces to stay behind.  That is what the Obama administration refused to do.  Eventually ending up with agreeing to such a small number of U.S. Forces that it would not have been effective in terms of providing security in Iraq.  The other thing that is indisputable, is that when Barack Obama took the Oath of Office in January 20th, 2009, the situation in Iraq because of the surge ordered under the Bush Cheney administration was stable.  Al Qaeda and Iraq had been defeated.  The Shia militias had largely been defeated.  Even President Obama and Vice President Biden claim that Iraq was a success at that point.What you see now, and I would say, not just in Iraq, but what you see in terms of the refugee crisis, all across Europe today is a tragedy there, is a direct consequence of Barack Obama's Middle East policies.  A direct consequence of walking away from the Middle East and creating chaos, creating a vacuum that ISIS, that Iran that America's enemies are now feeling WALLACE:  Let me pick up, because this is obviously a huge story right now, Mr. Vice president.  The migrant crisis.  D. CHENEY:  Right.  WALLACE:  Do you hold the President Obama and his policies responsible for what's happening across Europe now? D. CHENEY:  I think what's happened is, he's created a huge vacuum.  He's made it very clear, he's not going to use military force to any extent.  The vacuum that was created once the caliphate was formed and so forth, and enormous violence that's gone forward in Syria has contributed directly to the refugee crisis.  I think when the U.S. played a major role in the region when we were there on a significant basis, it would have been much easier to manage this kind of situation.  Today what you have is a crisis of major proportions in Syria supported primarily by the Iranians and that's driven hundreds of thousands of people to look for refuge someplace else.  They've all headed for Europe.  And it's a terrible tragedy.  WALLACE:  Mr. Vice President, what do you think of Donald Trump?D. CHENEY:  I have -- I don't know the man.  I've never met him personally.  I have refrained from judging any of our candidates positive or negatively because we've been concerned primarily about the book and getting the whole question of national security front and center in the debate this year.  At some point, we may endorse, but I haven't yet.  WALLACE:  Do you think he is -- I mean I know you.  You're an avid news follower.  Reader, watcher.  Do you think he's prepared fit to be president? D. CHENEY:  I'm not going to judge any of the candidates till we get farther down the road.L. CHENEY:  On our side.D. CHENEY:  On our side.  I'll be happy to talk about the Democrats.  WALLACE:  We're going to talk about Hillary Clinton in a moment.  But here's what Trump has said about your administration, sir.  In 2008, he said President Bush should be impeached for getting us into Iraq.  He said that ""would have been a wonderful thing.  He got us into the war with lies.""  And in 2011, here's what Trump said about you.  ""Here's a guy that did a rotten job as vice president.  Nobody liked him.  Tremendous divisiveness.""  President Trump? D. CHENEY:  Well, some people said worst things than that about me.  Again, Chris, I don't want to get into the business of judging candidates now.  It's early.  I want to see how they respond and react to this basic question of whether or not national security is the foremost issue in this campaign and what they proposed to do about it.  That's what their books ...WALLACE:  Well, do you think those are responsible comments on national security? D. CHENEY:  I'm not going to get into the business of getting into a dustup with any of the candidates.  Or support or oppose any of the candidates at this stage.  You've got to ask, but that's the answer.  WALLACE:  That's kind of what I figured you would say.(LAUGHTER)WALLACE:  But I got to ask.  L. CHENEY:  Right.  WALLACE:  Finally Hillary Clinton's e-mails.  Liz, and I expect you to be equally closed mouth on this, she says that she never sent or received any e-mails that were marked classified.  Is that a defense? L. CHENEY:  No, it marked classified is the sort of you know thing that the Clintons have come up with now backing off of what she said originally, which was that she never sent or received anything classified.  It is absolutely baffling, it is beyond comprehension that a secretary of state would think that she could conduct all of her business on a personal server.  We know now as well as the fact that she had this server set up, that she paid a state department employee separately to maintain it, that it was wiped clean when those e-mails were under subpoena.  She's got a big problem.  I think it gets worse for her every day that she's not able to explain what happened.  But her inability to be able to handle classified information according to the policies and potentially the laws of the nation obviously call into question her fitness to be commander in chief.  WALLACE:  Mr. Vice President, how do you right Hillary Clinton's time as Secretary of State, both on the emails and more importantly on her foreign policy initiatives? D. CHENEY:  I think she's as responsible as anybody in the Obama administration other than the president for what happened.  She carried out his policy for four years.  The Russian reset was one of her initiatives.  That didn't work out very well.  She traveled a lot of miles, but it's hard to find anything that she actually did.  I think they kept her on a very short leash at the White House.  I think this White House operated very much out of the National Security Council, state, defense, the generals, the diplomats I don't thinking had much impact on policy.  I think she was there basically supported everything Barack Obama did and bears responsibility for it.  WALLACE:  And you agree with your daughter, your wise daughter that she's unfit for presidency because of the way she handled her e-mails? D. CHENEY:  I think it raises very serious questions about how she operated.  And when you operate in that kind of environment, you are consciously aware all the time of the sensitivity of the material you deal with.  It's just part of -- You go to a National Security Council meeting and the situation room in the West Wing basement, there's a basket there, and everybody has got to put their electronics in the basket before you can even go in and participate in the conversation.  That happens every day.  WALLACE:  Vice President Cheney, Liz, thank you both, thanks for coming in.  It's always good to talk with you.  L. CHENEY:  Thank you, Chris.  WALLACE:  Up next, a spiraling migrant crisis in Europe.  Hundreds of thousands of people fleeing ISIS, war and poverty.  Now this tragic image has finally brought worldwide attention to the chaos.  We'll bring back the panel to discuss what Europe is doing about it. Plus, what do you think?  How should the world handle the refugee crisis?  Let me know on Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and use the #fns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  Here is the latest on the flood of migrants overwhelming Europe.  Thousands of refugees traveling by train and bus have now reached safe havens in Germany overnight.  Thousands more are expected today.  But neighboring Hungary which has struggled to manage the mass flow of people warns the human tide from the Middle East and Africa is still on the rise.  Senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot has more.  GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, this weekend, Europe is grappling with the biggest refugee crisis it has faced since World War II.  They have broken out of refugee camps, they have fought with police and in the thousands they've taken to roads and highways in their struggle for survival.  It's estimated that some 340,000 refugees and migrants have come to Europe so far this year fleeing war in Syria and Afghanistan, poverty in Africa and Asia.  There is no end in sight.  ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES:  Business as usual or incremental improvements of mechanisms in place will not be able to address what it is today a massive refuge and migration crisis in Europe.  PALKOT:  Many of these desperate people want to go to Germany for good reason.  It has the strongest economy and the most liberal asylum laws.  But other European countries like Hungary don't want to host these migrants.  They don't even want them passing through.  VIKTOR ORBAN, HUNGARIAN PRIME MINISTER:  But the moral human thing is to make clear, please don't come.  Why you have to go from Turkey to Europe?  Turkey is a safe country.  Stay there.  PALKOT:  Still bringing people together around the world this past week, the image of a three-year-old toddler on a Turkish beach.  He, his brother and mother drowned trying to make their way from Syria to Europe.  TIMA KURDI, CHILD'S AUNT:  They were going for a better life.  (END VIDEOTAPE)PALKOT:  For its part, the U.S. has taken in just over 1,000 Syrian refugees in the past year.  More to be done all around.  Chris?WALLACE:   Greg Palkot reporting from London.  Greg, thanks.  And we're back now with the panel.  Rick, you know the power of images and that image which we've seen repeatedly today and over the past week of 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi up on the beach like a piece of driftwood.  Really seemed to bring this problem into focus.  PATTERSON:  It's amazing how most Americans were sleeping until we saw that one little boy and that humanized things.  The pictures of the camp.  And this is a perfect storm of humanitarian disasters, where there are all sorts of contributors.  But one thing which I think has not been noted, this is also a national security problem of the first order.  We stand to lose a generation of refugee kids who are not properly educated, or employed.  And this is where our fear of terrorism redoubles on itself.  On the one hand, we don't want these folks coming in because we worry about potential terrorism.  On the other hand, this international failing of the first order is creating a whole generation of dislocated people which could really be problematic in the very ways we fear most.  WALLACE:  With this flood of refugees, Robert, you're seeing a very troubling split inside the European Union.  Some of the richer countries, like Germany, have been very generous in accepting and sheltering refugees, but some of the countries that don't have that kind of money have been -- and Hungary may be the prime example -- one, have been much more reluctant to bring in refugees and are opposed to the EU's idea of setting quotas on how many migrants each country is going to take.  COSTA:  You're seeing countries, especially those that are having economic problems, they're not trying to bring in all of these migrants.  At the same time, this issue is becoming more of one even in American politics.  I would check in with the campaign and say how are you handling this?  The first reaction is, it's a Barack Obama problem, it's President Obama's policy with Syria.  But they expect at the second debate, they have to have a policy idea ready if Europe is not ready to handle this situation, what is the United States' role.  WALLACE:  Well, and that's a very interesting question, Susan, because as Greg Palkot pointed out, so far the U.S. has accepted so far between 1,000 and 1,800 refugees from Syria in the last year.  So the question is, do we accept more? And Rick talked about a national security aspect, there is also the national security aspect if you start bringing in thousands of refugees, might some of them be terrorists? PAGE:  I suppose it's possible.  Although we recognize our obligation if people have a well founded fear of persecution in their homeland, that they get some international rights and some humanitarian treatment.  You could hardly argue that the people of Syria do not face a well founded fear of persecution in their homeland.  The United States has an obligation there.  And if we expect countries in Europe to step up to the plate with this, surely the United States will be forced to step up in a more serious way than taking 1,000 or 1,500 Syrian refugees.  There are what, 4 million Syrian refugees? Much greater numbers are going to come here.  I would also say that the United States has been well served by previous waves of refugees that we've accepted.  By the Vietnamese refugees that we accepted after the Vietnam War, who have become a great part of our nation.  So we worry about terrorism.  You can't look at these biblical pictures of people walking down miles and miles seeking just humanitarian treatment, and not be touched.  WALLACE:  George? WILL:  First, yes, shortly after we took in a million refugees from Vietnam after Vietnam fell, about 10, 15 years later, there were a whole bunch of high school valedictorians named Nguyen all over California.  So we benefited from immigrants there.  One of the questions here is, is this our fault because of what happened in Syria? I don't think we started the Syrian war, civil war.  I don't think we have a recipe for ending it.  The real problem is Syria -- is Libya.  A lot of refugees from Syria come overland into Europe or in a much safer trip, by water to Greece.  The really dangerous trip is across the Mediterranean to Italy from Libya.  In August 22nd, 27th rather, two boats carrying 500 people from Libya sank.  In April, 800 people drowned trying to get from Libya.  Now, what happened to Libya? That is our fault.  We went in, in a country that posed no conceivable threat to the United States, and in an eight-month protracted assassination attempt, decapitated their government, creating the failed state that today is producing all this.  And some presidential candidates, both the former secretary of state and some Republicans who were enthusiasts for the Libyan intervention, are going to have to answer for this.  One further point, some estimates are that as many as half a million refugees are now besieging Europe in the first eight months of this year.  That's 1/20th, actually less than 1/20th, than the number of human beings that Donald Trump proposes to deport.  (LAUGHTER)WALLACE:  I have to wrap my mind around that for a minute.  Are you saying you think the U.S. should be more proactive in bringing in refugees to this country, that we did it in the case of Vietnam and we can do it here? WILL:  Vietnam, we clearly had a particularly intense obligation, because we had fought a war, sought allies, and lost.  But it is part of our national heritage to do our duty.  COSTA:  I'm not sure there's a political appetite for that.  I was just in Mobile, Alabama with Trump, covering Trump in Iowa.  The people who are supporting the Republican front-runner don't seem to be in that mind-set.  So it's going to be hard for a lot of these Republican contenders, even if they see the human condition here, but they also have to -- they are trying to win a primary.  I don't see the voters pushing for this in the GOP.  PATTERSON:  The president needs to step up.  He's in office right now.  He needs to talk about what he can do in terms of letting in migrants, of international aid, of even using the sixth fleet to stem this tragedy at sea that we have going on.  We also need the Arab Gulf states to come in, we need a coordinated response from Europe, led by Germany.  You know, this is something which can't wait on politics.  People need to step up now.  PAGE:  You want to fuel terrorism, don't do anything about this refugee crisis.  If you're worried about terrorists, just let the situation continue to fester.  WALLACE:  There's another aspect to that, and that is, and George alluded to it, in addition to talking about Libya, which is Syria.  Syria is a failed state, and it is bleeding its problems all across Europe.  And we now hear the Russians may be coming into Syria.  That the slaughter of one ethnic religious group of another continues.  So as long as that continues, isn't there going to be just a never-ending supply of these migrants around Europe and conceivably the United States, George? WILL:  Yes, there will.  And if we had any way to stop the fighting in Syria, we should do it.  But I don't think we do.  Remember, at the end of the second world war, there were about 15 million displaced people in Europe.  Ten years later, there were essentially none.  We've handled crises like this before.  Now, this is different.  The Europeans were displaced, Europeans in Europe.  And Europe doesn't have our tradition of assimilation of people from around the world.  Europeans may have to learn a lesson from their transatlantic cousins -- us -- about how you do this.  WALLACE:  And there's another aspect of this, Susan, because to the degree -- I'm not saying that the U.S. and Europe should shut the door -- but to the degree that the U.S. and Europe open the door, doesn't that simply ensure that more refugees, more migrants, will leave Syria, will leave Turkey, which is a country that they go to right across the border, and will follow in their footsteps? PAGE:  We don't have a moral obligation to take everybody who wants to come to the United States.  We do have a moral obligation to take people who are facing this kind of situation.  WALLACE:  Thank you, panel.  See you next Sunday.  Up next, our power player of the week.  The head of the National Institutes of Health.  A man of science and faith.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  He rides a Harley and plays a mean guitar.  Which as we told you in April, makes what he does even more interesting.  Here is our power player of the week.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)DR. FRANCIS COLLINS, NIH DIRECTOR:  NIH probably has a bigger effect on your daily life than almost any other government agency.  WALLACE:  Dr. Francis Collins is director of the National Institutes of Health, the biggest supporter of biomedical research in the world.  On a campus outside Washington, 17,000 scientists work in 27 different institutes, coming up with breakthrough cures and treatments for disease.  COLLINS:  We are the house of hope.  This is where people come to when everything else has sort of stopped working.  WALLACE:  Collins is talking about the NIH Clinical Center, the world's largest research hospital.  COLLINS:  Now, at least for some patients, we have a Lazarus opportunity for people who are in terrible shape to be able to recover.  WALLACE:  What is a Lazarus opportunity? COLLINS:  They get into a clinical trial to try a brand-new therapeutic that is still very much under study, and they have this dramatic response, and they go home and go back to work.  WALLACE:  And all that is the tip of the iceberg for NIH, which gives out 90 percent of its funds in research grants to outside programs, which brings us to money.  The NIH budget this year is $31 billion, which, after spending cuts and sequestration, is where NIH was 12 years ago.  What does that mean for research grants? COLLINS:  Traditionally, we could fund about a third of those.  Now we're down to funding about a sixth of those, and so that means about half of the science is left on the table, at a time of such great promise.  WALLACE:  Collins knows about scientific breakthroughs.  He led the human genome project that in 2003 announced it had mapped the full sequence of human DNA.  COLLINS:  Inside each cell of your body is this instruction book made up of 3 billion letters of the DNA code.  If you know the reference genome for that person and you look at their cancer, you can see what happened.  Oh, that T should have been a C.  Now that gene is overactive.WALLACE:  Francis Collins is not your typical scientist.  He plays a guitar, adorned with a DNA helix.  He rides Harleys and he has written his book about his belief in God.  WALLACE:  How controversial was that in the scientific community? COLLINS:  It stirred things up a bit.  There are some questions science is poorly designed to deal with, like why are we here.  That's where for me, faith comes in, and understanding that science limits the questions you can ask, so let's find another way.  WALLACE:  While he's asking those questions, he'll keep working in the most powerful job in American science.  COLLINS:  I'm a physician.  I got into medicine hoping that I could help people.  We have 7,000 diseases for which we know the molecular cause.  We only have treatments for 500 of them.  To be able to stand at the helm of this amazing place and steer that forward is a dream come true.  (END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE:  And this summer, NIH awarded more than $30 million in grants to help tie information about the sequence of DNA into electronic medical records.  And that's it for today.  Have a great week.  And we'll see you next ""Fox News Sunday.""Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
