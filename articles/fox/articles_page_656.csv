MEGYN KELLY, HOST, ""THE KELLY FILE"":  Breaking tonight, five days until the final debate and Donald Trump trading fire with his accusers after two more women come forward with bombshell allegations.  Welcome to THE KELLY FILE, everyone.  I'm Megyn Kelly.  Kristin Anderson and Summer Zervos are the latest to join a growing chorus of women.  Each of the two told her story today with Anderson talking to the Washington Post about an experience she claimed she had with Mr. Trump at a popular nightclub in the early 90s.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KRISTIN ANDERSON, CLAIMS TRUMP GROPED HER IN MANHATTAN NIGHTCLUB:  The person on my right who unbeknownst to me at that time was Donald Trump. Put his hands up my skirt.  He did touch my vagina through my underwear. Absolutely.  And I pushed the hand away and I've got up and I turned around.  And I see these eyebrows.  Very distinct eyebrows of Donald Trump.  And I got up and I moved and I continued to talk with my friends.  And they said, oh, that's Donald Trump, I was like, eww, he's gross.  He just put his hand up my skirt. That's not okay.  And we all sort of brushed it off and moved on.       (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  The story from Summer Servos which came out today is more recent. It involves an alleged 2007 meet-up with Mr. Trump.  She described it as length during a press conference alongside Attorney Gloria Allred earlier today.  Here is some of what she said.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SUMMER ZERVOS, FORMER APPRENTICE CONTESTANT:  I met Mr. Trump when I was a candidate on the ""The Apprentice"" in Season Five.  I had the utmost admiration for Mr. Trump that even after I was fired I continued to see him as a possible mentor and a potential employer.  In 2007 I was going to be in New York for social obligations.  I contacted Mr. Trump's office to see if he was available for lunch.  I was informed that he could not have lunch, but that he would like to meet me in his office.  When I arrived he kissed me on the lips.  When I arrived, he kissed me on the lips.  I was surprised but felt that perhaps it was just his form of greeting.  We sat and spoke.  He was extremely complimentary.  He said he would love to have me work for him.  Mr. Trump said he would be coming to Los Angeles soon and he would contact me.  He then called again days later to let me know he was coming to Los Angeles.  He again called me after he had just landed in Los Angeles.  He asked me to meet him that evening at the Beverly Hills Hotel and asked me where I would like to have dinner.  When I arrived his security guards greeted me at the hotel.  He walked with me to greet Mr. Trump.  I assumed we were going to a restaurant in the hotel.  Instead I was taken to a bungalow.  The security guard opened the door and I went in.  I was standing in the entryway.  To my left was a bedroom and I saw Mr. Trump's clothes on the bed.  I did not see him but he greeted me with hello in a sing song voice that sounded like he-loo.  I waited for about 15 minutes until Mr. Trump emerged.  He had his suit on.  I stood up, and he came to me and started kissing me open mouth as he was pulling me towards him.  I walked away and I sat down in a chair.  He was on the left seat across from me and I made an attempt to conversation.  He then asked me to sit next to him.  I complied.  He then grabbed my shoulder and began kissing me again very aggressively and placed his hand on my breast.  I pulled back and walked to another part of the room.  He then walked up, grabbed my hand and walked me into the bedroom.  I walked out.  He then turned me around and said, let's lay down and watch some tele-tele.  He put me in an embrace and I tried to push him away.  I pushed his chest to put space between us and I said come on, man, get real.  He repeated my words back to me.  Get real, as he began thrusting his genitals.  He tried to kiss me again with my hands on his chest and I said, dude you're tripping right now.  Attempting to make it clear I was not interested.  He said, what do you want?  And I said, I came to have dinner.  He said, okay.  We'll have dinner.  He paced around the room, he acted like he was bit angry.  Dinner was delivered to the bungalow.  When dinner arrived he asked me to wait in a small room.  I felt that he did not want the waiter to see me.  After the table was set, he beckoned me to come out.  We shared a club sandwich.  The conversation then focused on the fact that I had a mortgage on my home which I told him was in good standing.  He then abruptly said he was tired and that he needed to go to bed and ended the conversation.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Well, this makes eight women now who claim that Donald Trump harassed them.  Seven of them coming forward since Trump defended his behavior at the presidential debate just five days ago claiming he never has groped women.  Now for the second day in a row, the presidential candidate is offering an emphatic denial of the charges.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  As you have seen, right now I am being viciously attacked with lies and smears.  It's a phony deal.  I have no idea who these women are.  These are lies being pushed by the media and the Clinton campaign to try and keep their grip on our country.  They are all false.  They're totally invented.  Fiction.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Joining me now, David Wohl, attorney and Donald Trump supporter and Julie Roginsky, Democratic strategist and Fox News contributor.  Good to see you both.  JULIE ROGINSKY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to see you, Megyn.DAVID WOHL, DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTER:  Hi, Megyn.  KELLY:  David, you and I are both lawyers.  You still practice law.  I don't.  WOHL:  But you still know your stuff, Megyn.   KELLY:  The problem is, we don't know whether this is true and Donald Trump is being accused and tried in the court of public opinion.  And we can't really get -- we can't know what the truth is.  There's not going to be a judge or a jury to resolve this before November 8th.  But if what these women say is true, then we're not just dealing with a flawed presidential candidate, we're dealing with a sexual predator.  So, how are the American people to make sense of that in the next three and a half weeks?   WOHL:  Well I would never stipulate that what they're saying is true, Megyn.  Ms. Anderson, for example, this happened she says 24 years ago. She said it may have been at the China club.  She's not sure exactly if it was there or somewhere else.  This is the full interview.  She says she doesn't remember who she was with.  There were no witnesses.  Something that traumatic which she describes, Megyn, is a felony digital penetration --  KELLY:  She didn't say penetration.   WOHL:  Exactly.  Well, she said, OK, touching, this is close enough.  I mean, it's a sexual battery.  It's a felony.  And she won't remember who she's with.  She won't remember which club she's at.   KELLY:  You don't know that.   WOHL:  Megyn, second, Ms. Zervos, by the way, she was reading directly from a script.  It looks like she was reading a book.  Hard to imagine there's a lot of credibility when she reads directly from the script.  KELLY:  Come on, David.  WOHL:  Because Megyn, why don't she just speak from the -- why can't she just tell the story like she is in a witness stand?KELLY:  Because she was nervous and she wanted to get it right.  Because she was nervous and she wanted to get it right.  The stakes are very high.   WOHL:  Well, Megyn, couple that.  Couple that with the WikiLeaks released today of communications between the Democratic National Committee -- Megyn.   KELLY:  We're going to get to that.   WOHL:  Several operatives.  That's fine.  Okay.  It's just hard to imagine much credibility, Megyn.  I've represented people for 27 years who have been charged falsely with allegations like this.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.WOHL:  You would be stunned at the frequency of which people are charged with embellishments, with completely false allegations, with half-truths, cases are dismissed, cased are never filed.  It is shocking.   KELLY:  That is true.  Julie, what he just said is true.  I mean, women do make false claims.  And we've seen that over and over again.  We look at the Duke rape case.  Right?  And the thing, what happened at UVA.  I mean, they can go a lot further than these women have gone in the claims.  But Donald Trump was the one who first told us he does this to women, grab them by -- right?  ROGINSKY:  Yes.KELLY:  Like he's the one who said it.  And just kiss them without even asking.  And now one by one these women have come forward from decades ago, I mean, every decade is covered of his adulthood saying me too, me too, me too in great detail.  And if this is an orchestrated smear, it's one hell of an orchestrated smear.   ROGINSKY:  Well, yes.  And let's put aside the fact that this smear may not be true and Donald Trump deserves the presumption of innocence.  What was most startling to me is not, this women are coming out now, because let us even assume that the system orchestrated smear which is hard to believe but let's -- that it is.  What was interesting me to me is Donald Trump's reaction today, to these allegations, essentially he was saying, some of these women are not hot enough.  KELLY:  We have that sound.  Let's play it for the audience so they know what we're talking about.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Take a look.  You take a look.  Look at her, look at her words. You tell me what you think.  I don't think so.  When you look at that horrible woman last night, you said, I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I was sitting with him on an airplane and he went after me on the plane. Yes, I'm going to go after you.  Believe me.  She would not be my first choice, that I can tell you.   (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Go ahead, Julie.   ROGINSKY:  As I said, let's put aside these allegations and let's just take him at his words.  Do you have to be a super model to be sexually harassed or assaulted?  Is that where we are that Donald Trump is basically saying that unless you're Claudia Shiver or somebody of that level that women would never get assaulted by anybody because they're simply not hot enough to be assaulted.  I mean, you know, you know, that is where I think women have trouble relating to anything that he's saying.  Because again, even if you'd give him the presumption of innocence, his words are so damning.  They're so offensive.  They're so viscerally insulting that there's not much else to say about these allegations other than he dug his own hole deeper and deeper today by making the comments that he made.  KELLY:  Why is he talking about the looks of the women involved, David?WOHL:  Well, when you hit Mr. Trump with a lie, with a slanderous libelous allegation like this woman did and that's his position, then he's going to hit back twice as hard, Megyn and he doesn't hold back.  KELLY:  By calling you ugly.  That's the way he's going to handle it.  WOHL:  Well, you know what?  Compare what she said about what he did to what he said to her.  There's no real comparison.  Yes, it was kind of a teenage remark.  I'd say, I wouldn't counsel him to talk like that.  But that is who he is.  He will hit you back twice as hard when you hit him with a non-truth, of an untruthful allegation.  Which that is his position. And so, all bets are off.   KELLY:  Does it give you any pause.  I mean, because as I said at the top, we don't know which is true.  One of these two things is true.  Either he has been very unfairly accused or he is a predator.  Does it concern you at all that option two is still in play?WOHL:  No because I've met him.  I know this man.  I've talked to him. I've seen him interact with children.  KELLY:  You wouldn't know the strain of him.  WOHL:  He's a wonderful good man, Megyn.  I wouldn't know the strain, you know everybody can have skeletons in their closet, Megyn.  KELLY:  Generally the sexual predators don't do to their guy friends.WOHL:  I'm not finding it.  I'm not finding it.  I know his character.  And the character of someone who does this is not Donald Trump's character.   ROGINSKY:  May I say something about this?  I grew up in the 1980s with Dr. Cliff Huxtable, the beloved dad of all of America.  And look at where Bill Cosby is today with his allegations.  So, you knowing somebody and leading them man to man is not exactly experience, we should note.  (CROSSTALK)ROGINSKY:  Secondly, let me just make another point.  KELLY:  Go ahead, quickly.ROGINSKY:  The other point I want to make is, listen, insulting a woman's looks, we're not 12 years old.  You know, I've been insulted, Megyn, I'm sure you've been insulted.  Insulting our looks is not something that's not going to make us curl up in a ball and make us cry.  That is where he's coming back and hitting twice as hard.  That is a damn bad defense I have to say.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.ROGINSKY:  I mean, what is that other than a schoolyard taunt that doesn't work on adult women.  KELLY:  Okay.ROGINSKY:  That's ridiculous.   KELLY:  Listen, having said all that, listen, you have to keep in mind that he has no time to defend himself.  He's out there trying to run a presidential campaign and he has been placed in an impossible situation.   Who placed him there?  Was it him and his own behavior or somebody else?   WOHL:  Megyn, the good news is on Wednesday, Chris Wallace is going to be a legitimate debate moderator.  I can't wait.   KELLY:  Yes.  We're looking forward to that.  Thank you both.  ROGINSKY:  Thanks.WOHL:  Thank you, Megyn.  KELLY:  A couple of days ago in a fiery column on FOXNews.com, a young woman by the name of Ying Ma defended Donald Trump declaring herself an unabashed fan of the Republican nominee.  She wrote, quote, ""Strangers and friends alike have wondered how a highly educated Chinese American woman could possibly support a man widely condemned as racist, sexist, misogynistic, xenophobic and Islamaphobic.  It is not that complicated, really.  I like the candidate and what he stands for.  And I reject the character propagated by the mainstream media and his opponents.""  With me now, Ying Ma who is also a deputy director of the Committee for American Sovereignty, a pro-Trump Super Pac.  Ying, good to see you.  Thank you for being here tonight.   YING MA, COMMITTEE FOR AMERICAN SOVEREIGNTY:  Megyn, great to be with you as well.   KELLY:  Let's start there, right?  Because I think a lot of women out there are saying, how could any woman support him at this point when you see the number women coming forward and accusing him?  And we'll just start there and ask you that.   MA:  Sure.  Well, Megyn, I think the allegations of sexual assault are very serious, they're very disturbing at this point.  I know as much as you know, which is what we hear and see in the press.  And Mr. Trump obviously has denied all charges categorically.  So, we simply don't know exactly what went on.  Obviously I don't deny that they are very disturbing allegations, but I support Donald Trump.  And when I wrote that column I listed all the reasons why I support him.  There are very serious issues that this country faces, we've got a lot of challenges and I believe he is the man who would be --  KELLY:  Explain that.  Yes.  Because you wrote this sort of before the sexual assault allegations were coming out.   MA:  Indeed.  Indeed.   KELLY:  But, but there was still a lot of controversial stuff that he had done and said prior to that, and you still said, this is not a deal breaker for me.  Explain why.   MA:  Sure.  Well, let me start with all of the controversial stuff that he's said and done.  I think that from my point of view just because, just because somebody said controversial things doesn't disqualify him.  Though, the left has sort of suffocated our public debate and our private discourse for a very long time.  That, you know, you're allowed to say certain things about women, about minorities, about religious groups and nobody can even have an honest conversation any more.  And I think one of the reasons why Donald Trump has resonated with so many Americans is that he's considered to be an authentic person who is willing to tell the truth.  A lot of times he says things that are very different from what other politicians would say but the American people understand that he's speaking from the heart.  And that's actually one of the reasons why he has tremendous appeal.  And so one of the main reasons I like him is he is politically incorrect.  Just because I'm a woman, just because I am a minority, just because I'm an immigrant, does not mean that I need the left to coddle me the way that it preaches.   KELLY:  Ying, let me ask you.  You know, if ten more women came forward between now and November 8, would it change your view of him?   MA:  I think these are very serious allegations, Megyn.  I don't deny that at all.  But let me also say that -- let me also say that even though the media has covered this so much, wall-to-wall coverage in the last few days. I don't remember CNN, NBC, ABC, ever interviewing any of the victims who alleged that Bill Clinton assaulted them.  KELLY:  Uh-hm.MA:  I don't remember ABC interviewing Juanita Broaddrick.  KELLY:  Some have said today, I will say this, some have said that they asked and were refused right here on this program.  We interviewed Kathleen Willey, and we have that.  But Ying, what is the name of your book? Because it sounded very interesting?  MA:  The name of the book is ""Chinese Girl in the Ghetto"" and it talks about my family's journey from communist China to inner-city Oakland, California.  KELLY:  And pulling yourself up and relying on yourself --   (CROSSTALK)MA:  Yes.  KELLY:  It's the message that resonates with everybody.  I have to run. Because we have a tight show tonight but it's great to see you.  MA:  Thank you so much.   KELLY:  So, we also have a new bombshell from WikiLeaks tonight involving the Clinton campaign and its connection to some very ugly questions about President Obama, his faith and his drug use.  Have you heard about this?Plus, new revelations in an alleged leak of debate questions.  We'll dig into exactly how a copy of the question asked by Roland Martin ended up in the hands of Donna Brazile who was advising the Democrats.  Plus, Donald Trump today called out a Mexican billionaire accusing him of orchestrating the media attacks against him.  Chris Stirewalt and Howie Kurtz are next on that.  Don't go away.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Reporters at ""The New York Times"" they're not journalists.  They're corporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim and for Hillary Clinton.  We are not going to let it happen where they decide the outcome of our elections.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Breaking tonight, new reaction as Donald Trump takes criticism of the media to a whole new level claiming to be the victim of a conspiracy involving a Mexican billionaire, Hillary Clinton and ""The New York Times."" Watch.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  No paper is more corrupt than the failing The New York Times. The largest shareholder in the Times is Carlos Slim.  Now, Carlos Slim as you know comes from Mexico.  He's given many millions of dollars to the Clintons and their initiatives.  Reporters at The New York Times, they're not journalists.  They are corporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim and for Hillary Clinton.  We are not going to let it happen where they decide the outcome of our elections.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  And it's not just ""The New York Times"" feeling the heat.  The crowd at some Trump rallies have begun yelling at reporters, even more so than normal.  In fact, police in one city had to monitor the press motorcade after hearing chants like this.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  They are so dishonest --   (CROWD CHANTING ""CNN SUCKS"")   (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  They're chanting ""CNN sucks.""  Here now, Chris Stirewalt, co-host of ""Perino & Stirewalt.""  And Howie Kurtz, host of ""MediaBuzz.""  I mean, listen, they've been coming after the media, you know from team Trump for months now.  It does seem to be reaching a fever pitch, though -- Chris.   CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS CO-HOST, ""PERINO AND STIREWALT"":  And now there's a Mexican, too.  So you've got it all.  I don't know why you would need -- if there was a conspiracy, let's say there was a conspiracy that as Trump says, bankers, and a global elite, and this Mexican billionaire and Hillary Clinton are all part of this -- to defeat Donald Trump.  Why is he helping them so much?  Why does he help them every day?  Why does he go on the campaign trail and say that the women that accuse him of sexual assault were too ugly.  Why does he go on the campaign trail and make, in an aside when he's defending himself on sexual assault, does he stop and say, by the way, I don't think that Hillary Clinton is attractive.  It doesn't take a conspiracy to defeat somebody who is defeating himself every day.  I do not understand it.   KELLY:  Uh-hm.  Uh-hm.  By the way, do we have that sound bite on Hillary? We had that cued up just a bit ago.  Do you guys have that?  Okay.  We're going to get it.  Howie, it's to the points now where there is swastika signs showing up about the press at the Trump rallies.  The committee to protect journalists has condemned Trump now, saying, like this is too far. There is -- I get it, the media we're easy to hate but there is a First Amendment and what we do actually is important.   HOWIE KURTZ, FOX NEWS HOST, ""MEDIABUZZ"":  Yes.  And clearly Trump is whipping up a lot of sentiment among his base against the media.  Look, it is fair for Donald Trump to question whether this is media overkill.  There is virtually no other campaign story right now.  But there is zero evidence that Carlos Slim because he owns a bunch of stock has anything to do with the editorial decisions of The New York Times. There is zero evidence of coordination among the different news organization --  KELLY:  Doesn't seem to matter anymore.   KURTZ:  Excuse me?KELLY:  That doesn't seem to matter anymore.  Right?  I mean, this is the year you can say anything.   KURTZ:  Well, yes.  But I'm trying to provide a reality check here.  And the fact is, these women, we don't know whether they're telling the truth or not.  As you said earlier.  But they're going on the record, they're risking their reputations.  And for Trump to be denouncing this media as part of a smear campaign, what it does is it really pleases his base but I don't know where it's adding any more votes to his column.   KELLY:  Uh-hm.  Here's the sound bite that we were referencing earlier. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  I'm standing at my podium and she walks in front of me, right?  She walks in front of me.  You know?  And when she walked in front of me, believe me, I wasn't impressed.   (END VIDEO CLIP)STIREWALT:  Don't do it.   KELLY:  I mean, constantly, constantly.  He called Carly Fiorina unattractive and then he tried to fix it by saying she's beautiful.  Which is like, just stop commenting on her looks.  STIREWALT:  Well, and the other thing is, it's not inexplicable how -- whether you think the allegations are true,  whether you think they're false, whether you think the media overdoes it, quit helping -- if you think the press is rigged, quit helping the rigged press.  If that's really what you believe that it's a conspiracy against you, stop helping.   KELLY:  I mean, CNN is going wall to wall on the Trump allegations.  I mean, they are going wall to wall.  I mean, every single person is getting half an hour, you know, uninterrupted.  And it's a little discomforting. These women deserve to have their say and this is a real story.  I mean, this is a real story.  But fact-checking it in, you know, 12 hours-time has posed some challenges.  Let's move on.  Howie, I defended Donna Brazile, I defended CNN saying, I cannot imagine CNN ever sharing a debate question, a town hall question with the candidate prior to a debate.  It certainly looks like that did happen now though because now we've seen an e-mail that shows the exact question that Roland Martin asked Hillary Clinton at this town hall.  The exact one was shared with Donna Brazile before he asked it.  KURTZ:  You know, Donna Brazile told me she was flabbergasted by these allegations but she couldn't explain why in her own e-mail to the Clinton campaign, she said I sometimes get the questions in advance.  CNN didn't give her the questions it turns out.  Roland Martin was partnering in this town hall.  Obviously did give this to CNN.  Even CNN isn't defending this anymore.  CNN anchor Jake Tapper says that this is horrifying and unethical and looks bad for everyone and it really underscores the risk of having one of your premier contributors.  Somebody was also the number two official in the Democratic Party.  So, to do that and give the questions in advance I think clearly is a stain on CNN which, you know, would never want this to happen.   KELLY:  Well, and here's Jake Tapper to your point.  Listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR:  My understanding is, there has been -- that the e-mail to Donna came from either Roland Martin or someone around Roland Martin.  So, it's horrifying to have us partner with that person and then they do something completely unethical and share it with Donna Brazile who then shares it with the Clinton campaign.  I condemn it in no uncertain terms.  It's awful.   (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Chris, I'll give you the last word.   STIREWALT:  I have no idea how Chris Wallace is going to vote in the election.  I have no idea.  I've known you for years, I have no idea how you're going to vote in the election.  I don't know how Bret Baier votes in the election.  That's why it's good to have journalists and not partisans running debates and acting as you the interlocutors when you these events.   KELLY:  Uh-hm.  And think about that, even on the Republican side this year, the RNC tried to force news organizations to allow Republican pundit to join the debate teams, Fox News said, no.  And we were one of the only news organizations to refuse.  It's fraught with peril.  The situations fraught with perils as this proves.  Good to see you both.   STIREWALT:  You bet.   KURTZ:  Good to see you.KELLY:  So, what happens if Donald Trump shows up to the final debate with kind of fire we have seen on the trail in the past two days?  Mark McKinnon and Larry Sabato have some thoughts on that, next.   Plus, WikiLeaks has now released hacked e-mails about the Clinton campaign and its connection to some very ugly questions about Barack Obama, his faith and his drug use, next.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Well it beats me because there's not one shred of truth in what you've just read.     (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: From the World Headquarters of Fox News, it's the ""The Kelly File"" with Megyn Kelly.MEGYN KELLY, THE KELLY FILE HOST: Five days to the final debate and the Clinton campaign has now had to deal with more on a week of embarrassing daily revelations. Thanks to WikiLeaks. Today, we saw several more including a 2008 e-mail about possible ways to attack then Senator Barack Obama, including Senator Obama's past drug use and his late father's Muslim faith.Here's the exact wording of some of the topics, including quote ""Obama's note the emphasis on pronunciation,"" father was a Muslim and Obama grew group up among Muslims in the world's most populous Islamic country. Here they're considering whether he would be hit on this. And quote, ""Obama described his former use of cocaine as using a little blow.""After today, learning that the Clinton camp was floating these ideas eight years ago, we went back to see what happened. What happened when Mrs. Clinton was asked about those nasty rumors about President Obama or then Senator Obama's faith. Here she is on ""Meet the Press"".(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TIMOTHY JOHN RUSSERT, NBC NEWS' WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF AND THE MODERATOR OF MEET THE PRESS: We've seen Clinton surrogates trying to implant the false idea that Mr. Obama might be a Muslim and perhaps a drug dealer to boot. What is this all about?HILLARY CLINTON, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, beats me, because there's not one shred of truth in what you've just read, and I regret that because obviously a lot of people have been, you know, given information or an impression that is absolutely false.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Wherever could they have gotten that impression from? Joining me now, Carl Higbie, a former Navy SEAL and spokesman for the Great America PAC and Richard Fowler, a Fox News contributor and senior fellow with the New Leaders Council. Wow. Can - where, Carl .(CROSSTALK)CARL HIGBIE, FORMER NAVY SEAL AND SPOKESMAN FOR THE GREAT AMERICA PAC: Surprised, we're live (ph).KELLY:  . where could they have gotten the impression that he -- me might be a Muslim.(LAUGHTER). or might be a drug dealer? Oh, wait .HIGBIE: Yeah.KELLY: . Paul Begala (ph) is already testing it.HIGBIE: Yeah. Well, I mean, this is -- this is an increased narrative that we're seeing come out of the Hillary Clinton campaign. You've seen needy Latinos, you've seen, you know, Muslim faith, the Persia (ph), Catholic faith. They're attacking Donald Trump for being a racist and a bigot. But now, you see the inner workings of the Clinton campaigns for these releases, and surprise, surprise, not only is Hillary Clinton going back on herself and flip-flopping once again, but we're seeing -- we're seeing the same stuff that she's criticizing others for.KELLY: You know, Richard, some say about Donald Trump, his biggest flaw is he shows you all of his flaws. He's open about his flaws. I mean, that may be true and she may be just as lot (ph) he is, but she hides it better. These WikiLeaks are showing us a different kind of character in the people she surrounds herself with. They are talking about testing how -- where -- how it's going to play that his dad was Muslim, and he was raised in a Muslim country, and then she's out there like, ""It's horrible.""RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND SENIOR FELLOW WITH THE NEW LEADERS COUNCIL: Well, here's -- here's the thing, Megyn. Politics is a blood sport. So, in any tough primary, you're going to have opposition research. I've done opposition research binders (ph) before. I have had friends who do them. You do these binders, you test messaging just in case you need to go there. There's a break in case of emergency. Sometimes candidates break it. Sometimes they don't. When they don't break it, we don't talk about it. When they do break it, we talk about it, case in point.In 2012, Newt Gingrich ran all of these crazy ads against Mitt Romney. A lot of the stuff was true. That came from an oppo (ph) research file where they tested the messaging, and they tested it out and they actually broke it and they used it.  So, this happens all of the time in campaigns. Does it speak--KELLY: OK. So, what happens--(CROSSTALK)FOWLER: --to Hillary Clinton's integrity?KELLY: --but then -- but the sound bite .FOWLER: No.KELLY: We just played puts the lie to her behavior. And what we've seen in this WikiLeaks mails is, she admits she has to say one thing publicly and another thing privately, not that she has to, but that she chooses to, and what she has said privately is to dismiss Democratic supporters as needy Latinos and her campaign team has vicious attacks on Catholics, and we all know that they considered going after Bernie Sanders for his faith at the DNC level during this primary, now she's thinking about going after Barack Obama for his faith in 2008.I mean, Carl, you could pardon the American public for not giving her the high ground.HIGBIE: Absolutely, and this is indicative. She is criticizing Trump for far less and now you see this and it's like -- it's like--FOWLER: Thinking (ph) about that--HIGBIE: --what point does the American public say, Hillary Clinton is a liar and I don't want to vote for her. This is what people are voting against. They're tired of people flip-flopping, doing one thing behind closed doors, one thing publicly and then accomplishing nothing once they get elected.  This is why people are voting for Donald Trump.KELLY: I will say this is what -- this is what Paul Begala says who is on the e-mail. He's now a CNN contributor but he -- he -- I think he's affiliated with the Super PAC that helps Democrats.  He writes every campaign and every PAC, tests political negatives, potential negatives against the candidate they support. That's all this was. He says, this is all about what was going to happen in the general election. In other words, they are trying to put it on, ""Oh, whoever ran against Obama was going to have to hit Obama, so we, the Democrat, need to figure out what the vulnerabilities were."" Richard.FOWLER: That -- that's absolutely it, Megan. I want to add one of the point, and I think--KELLY: Yeah.FOWLER: --let's be very clear. What Hillary Clinton is doing was that every campaign does. What Donald Trump is doing is what I would call unconventional and straight out weird. He's attacked women, he's attacked African-Americans, he's attacked Latinos openly, publicly, unapologetically, not for political poll testing just because he thinks it's a good idea, and that's why these two things are different. Hillary Clinton did it for political--(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Well, she -- she had attacked.FOWLER: --and I'm not saying she's right. I'm saying.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: She -- her people have attacked--FOWLER: She did it for political motives.KELLY: Latinos, the needy ones and Muslims.FOWLER: Yeah, but that's not Hillary Clinton.KELLY: But then she's done it privately. It's like -- that's it. Give it to all the people. She's around -- this is our campaign chairman on this e- mail.FOWLER: This is -- but that was -- what she's campaigning on. Donald Trump being so bad about, but she's doing it herself. Yes, because he's doing it openly--KELLY: It's not her.FOWLER: --in public with veil.KELLY: But it's her tough people. All right.HIGBIE: Oh, that resource (ph) is public.KELLY: I got to go. Good to see you both.FOWLER: Thanks, Megyn.HIGBIE: Good to see you, Megyn.KELLY: Well, five days to the first ever Fox News moderated presidential debate. There are growing suggestions it could be the most dramatic showdown of the entire year. I mean, what is going to happen at this thing? Mark McKinnon has seen a lot of these, so is Larry Sabato. They are here next live.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK MCKINNON, POLITICAL ADVISOR, REFORM ADVOCATE, MEDIA COLUMNIST, AND TELEVISION PRODUCER: That means double down and he stayed on offense the whole night. He wants to show he's still in the ring, and he's to get -- and he can still swing.JOHN HEILEMANN, CO-MANAGING EDITOR OF BLOOMBERG POLITICS, AN AMERICAN JOURNALIST FOR NEW YORK MAGAZINE: You know, I think he survives. I think he survives. But he can't win the presidency with 40 or 41 percent of the country. But people love him would have loved this debate for purpose (ph).MCKINNON: Right.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Tonight, a sneak peek of what to expect from Wednesday's first ever Fox News Presidential Debate. If last Sunday's debate is any indication, our own Chris Wallace will be moderating two candidates on fire, of Clinton and Trump, ready to give it everything they've got at their final meeting before Election Day. Wow.We checked in with our friends at Showtime's ""The Circus"" for an inside look at what the debates look like after the candidates have left the stage, and here's what ""The Circus"" found in the spin room last week. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MCKINNON: Katrina, your take on tonight.KATRINA PIERSON, SPOKESWOMAN, TRUMP CAMPAIGN: It was different from last time because that first debate, he really was getting a feet wet and he made a promise to go after her record this time and he did.JOEL BENENSON, SENIOR STRATEGIST, CLINTON CAMPAIGN: He came to be attacker. He tried to not promote (ph) his game and he failed.COREY LEWANDOWSKI, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  I think there was [BEEP] lock down tonight. This is from quintessential Trump. He was excellent at the moment.SEAN HANNITY, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FOX NEWS: Not now. Not even close.MCKINNON: Yes.HANNITY: He came out strong, quite hard, why -- and was fair and strong and resolute. He's getting on substance (ph). He's great on everything. Probably too nice of this side and you know what, she took the gloves off, came for the gloves off, and it's backfired in the last two debates.BRIAN FALLON, PRESS SECRETARY, CLINTON CAMPAIGN: I think it was aggressive in a way that he's trying to motivate his floor supporters there and probably Trump in the last 48 hours.MARK HALPERIN, CO-MANAGING EDITOR OF BLOOMBERG POLITICS AND A SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST FOR MSNBC: So, if the Clinton doesn't out on Friday and Trump could come in prepared like that, good moments, much more preparation, I think he would have left here with some momentum. But the tape is still out there. Still an issue, he didn't really--(CROSSTALK)MCKINNON: Well, look, I mean, he's doubled down and he's stayed on offense, the whole night. He wants to show he's still in the ring and he's to get - he can still swing.HEILEMANN: I think he survives. I think he survives but you can't win the presidency with 40 or 41 percent of the country, but people love him, would have loved this debate performance--MCKINNON: Right.HEILEMANN: --but is it a gain in a single vote?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, the creator and host of that show, ""The Circus"" Mark McKinnon. He served as chief media advisor to President George W. Bush, and the director of UVA Center for Politics, Dr. Larry Sabato. Great to see you both. So, Mark, if -- who is so riveting to see those clips? I mean, do you think the tape just wiped out everything we saw at that debate?MCKINNON: Oh, it secured everything and unfortunately, for Trump, it secured a lot of the bad news that was breaking on Hillary Clinton at the same time. All those e-mails, the paid speeches. So, I mean, this I was a great opportunity for him on offense and the tape to have obscured -- it just blocked out the sun, it's blocked out--KELLY: Yes.MCKINNON: --everything for.KELLY: Larry, does the polling support that?LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR OF UVA CENTER FOR POLITICS: Yeah, essentially. You know, real events make a difference in these polls. You know, most people have made up their mind, but basically you either enthuse your party base or you depress it. I think it's obvious who is depressed.KELLY: Yes. Mark, you actually have been on these presidential campaigns. What would you say at this point if you were on the Trump campaign? What would you be telling the candidate?MCKINNON: Well, I would have told him a different strategy in the last debate, but now that he's gone this direction, it's a -- the clear strategy that he's imploring right now is to burn the boats, just like the Vikings when they go and invade, they burn the boats so you can't retreat. His whole approach now is we're doubling down, tripling down all in and to just kind of blow up everything in -- inside and hope that he survives somehow.KELLY: Yes.MCKINNON: So, I think--KELLY: Part?MCKINNON:  --I think -- I think, he's like--KELLY: Or do you feel like he just had no other options.(CROSSTALK)MCKINNON: But I think in the next debate their plan is that if she goes low, we go lower.KELLY: Right.MCKINNON: Now, she's just got to paddle very carefully--KELLY: Yes.MCKINNON: --and not .KELLY: She's trying to stay above of it that's sure.MCKINNON: Yeah, now. The -- here's what I would counsel both of them is the third debate is the last chance. This has been so negative. I remember like Ohio in 2004. It was so negative. This is an opportunity for either one of them to go real high, to go -- I mean, to really--KELLY: Yes.MCKINNON: --just brush this all away and really purport (ph) a positive powerful Reagan-like message.KELLY: You're so cute. You thought 2004 was negative.MCKINNON: Oh, come on.KELLY: Isn't he adorable? He's -- he's adorable.(LAUGHTER)MCKINNON: At point (ph).(LAUGHTER)KELLY: Larry, the polling shows that whatever -- whoever Trump appealed to it, that last debate, it was not that core group of women to whom he needs to appeal if he wants to improve his numbers before November 8. The women are just not with him.SABATO: Women aren't with him. A surprising number of suburban Republicans are holding out. Millennials, he' dead last really when you look at Clinton and Gary Johnson. He's got a lot of work to do just about everywhere and every time I look at the polling averages, Clinton is moving up a fraction of a point. And it adds up over time with 24 days to go.KELLY: But what do you make of all of the -- I mean, the Trump crowd sizes are amazing. They are huge and she's got like four people at hers.SABATO: Well, if you're asking me about crowd sizes.KELLY: Yeah.SABATO: I can give you plenty of anecdotes of losing candidates who told me they were going to win because despite the polls, they have enormous crowds. That includes everybody from George McGovern in 1972 to Mitt Romney in 2012.KELLY: Yes.SABATO: Crowds are great, you know. They are -- they are full of people who help you and go out and volunteer and all of the rest of it. But we're talking about an electorate of 135 million, Megyn, 135 million.KELLY: Yes.SABATO: Suddenly, those crowds don't seem very large, do they?KELLY: I remember seeing it with Mitt Romney, too. It was amazing.MCKINNON: Well. What she lacks in enthusiasm, she's got a big ground game investing a lot in the state turnout operations. And last report FTC (ph) report, Donald Trump had spent $400,000 in statewide turnout operations and $1.8 million on hats. So, we're going to test the hats right here.KELLY: Wow, wow. Great to see you, Mark. You, too, Larry. Thank you.SABATO: Thanks, Megyn.KELLY: Up next, if you'll permit me, a personal moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Well, my Nana Antoinette Francis Holzworth was a feisty little girl who came into this world on October 1, 1915. Last night at 101 years old Nana's journey here ended and a new one began. Nan grew up poor, the daughter of loving and hardworking parents. Her dad shoveled coal to support his family. She remembered the day they fist got electricity. Nan sitting in the living room as a small child flipping the light switch on and off, on and off, marveling at it.Nana went on to marry a firearm, my Pop Pop, an Italian immigrant, who thought the sun rose and set around her. They had two kids, my mom and my uncle and then there were two spit firewomen in the family. Nana lived through two World Wars, the Great Depression, the Lindbergh kidnapping and the assassination of a U.S. President. She came into the world when women couldn't vote and went out as the country considers electing its first female president.She was from a different time. One time, Pop Pop hurt himself fighting a fire. They could have sued but they didn't. And they wouldn't. Who would do that? Nana wondered many times. Things were different then. The greatest generation. Nan helped raise us, and while she gave us free range (ph), she was always watching. Even these days at 9:00 p.m., she would turn on ""The Kelly File"" and from her lady boy recliner, she would be watching.""I can't understand a damn word you're saying,"" she would tell me, but I like to make sure you're OK. There's something deeply (ph) special about the love of a grandparent and their grandchildren. It's deeply unconditional. In Nana's eyes, we could do no wrong nor could our children, her treasures as she called them. We knew at her age that there wasn't much time left but that doesn't stop the pain or the loss we feel on saying good-bye.To our viewers who have always been so kind with well wishes for Nana, U wanted to say a heartfelt thank you. And to leave you with this bit of a poem which for 31 years, since the day Pop Pop died, Nana kept on her bedside table.Should you go first and I remain, one thing I'd had you do, walk slowly down that long lone path for soon I'll follow you. I'll want to know each step you take, that I may walk the same. For some day, down that lonely road, you'll hear me call your name.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: And we are very excited about the debate next week. We hope you'll keep it tuned right her to the Fox News Channel to watch that. We'll be live, ""The Kelly File"" from the West Coast beginning on Monday straight to the -- to the big event on Wednesday and look forward to sharing that with you.You know, during the break just checked the Twitter feed and check Facebook feed, and so often we complain about the nasty messages on there and you've heard many anchors read about the mean tweets. It's not all bad. Nana, I thank you for all of the lovely messages that you're firing my way. They really are uplifting, and it's nights like this that you feel the love and the support of the viewers who I don't always see you but I see you on the streets and I know that we connect when we share the news whether it's dark or not, night after night, not just you and me but the people in my control room and the people in this room and the people in your living room at home. And we're glad you trust us in these moments and times like this.Good night, everybody.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

IT IS FOX NEWS' POLICY THAT CONTRIBUTORS DISCLOSE POSITIONS THEY HOLD IN STOCKS THEY DISCUSS, THOUGH POSITIONS MAY CHANGE. READERS OF ""Cost of Freedom Recap"" MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN INVESTMENT DECISIONS.ANTI-TRUMP PROTESTS SPARK DEBATE OVER FREEDOM TO PROTEST VS. FREEDOM OF SPEECHSteve Forbes:  What's happening is a form of political intimidation. It's political pollution, David. The First Amendment guarantees you free speech even if you're a candidate. It's one thing to protest outside a rally, but to disrupt a rally, that Nazi Germany Fascist Italy. It has no place in America. What Trump should say at these rallies, if somebody starts to get disruptive, politely have that person removed. It's not right. Free speech trumps everything.Bruce Japsen: Well, full disclosure here; I was actually invited by a real estate developer friend of mine, who said he had an extra ticket to the Chicago rally. Because I reserved the right to jeer, I did not want to get hit in the head with a beer bottle, so I did not go.  If law enforcement knows, and honestly it's a diverse neighborhood where this protest was at, I didn't want to go, because I thought something would go wrong, and I think law enforcement should shut these things down, because the rhetoric is so high.  If they hear things are going to happen, they should contain them so people don't get hurt.  His rhetoric is so inflammatory.  Rich Karlgaard: Yeah, they do. They learned this in our university system, where free speech has gone out the window, where you can shut down commencement speakers, get them disinvited, and these protesters think this is par for the course.Elizabeth Macdonald: I think Trump is using menacing language, I think he is missing a golden opportunity to look presidential.  I wish he would take that up.  But you know, you don't shut it down.  I think it's wrong. We see that with the Black Lives Matter movement, going after Bernie Sanders and trying to shut downs his speeches there.  I'll tell you something that could back fire and here is how it back fired in the '60s when if you agreed or not, I agreed with the Vietnam War protesters, I was against that war. But you know, the silent majority didn't like the mayhem. They didn't like the shutting down of speech and they voted in Nixon. So that can backfire on people who may not want people elected into office.Sabrina Schaeffer: Sure, absolutely, David.  Politics isn't polite and I don't believe that there's ever been this golden era of political civility, but I do think that people are saying hey the political rancor has become so intense, so deafening that we simply can't have political discourse, we can't have a free exchange of ideas. That's really the cornerstone of our democracy.  If those protesters are preventing us from having any kind of meaningful discussion about the issues that we all care about, then I think they need to be removed.  John Tamny: It's interesting here. They only like free speech if they agree with it, but they've got this idea that we have a right against being offended in the United States, and that is wholly opposite what we're about.  Presidential candidates whom we may not like should be allowed to speak freely.  So should obnoxious college students and I would add so should rich people like the Kochs and big corporations have every right to speak freely.  If not, we're not the United States.   CLINTON WALKS BACK COMMENTS ON PUTTING COAL MINERS OUT OF WORK AMID BACKLASHJohn Tamny: Basically she wants to impose 13th century energy ideas on a modern economy. Anytime a politician meddles in this way in the natural workings of the economy, it's going to be a capital repellant and lead to job destruction. I would just say let's not leave it at coal, let's face it, the size and scope of government itself is a huge company and job deterrent.  We need to shrink these guys.  Bruce Japsen: Well I think what she means is the coal states in these areas, they need to diversify.  It's not a passing fad that people are going to be using less fossil fuels and climate change is real, so I think the whole diversification is what these areas of the country that have coal manufacturing  plants need to do.Elizabeth Macdonald: And that really hurts. We're talking about blue collar workers also, and with the moves against fracking as well.  I'm telling you the Democrats have no more sense than a flock of geese. These are the blue collar voters that are going for Trump right now, so, you don't wipe out entire industries, you fix them. That's what the industries were doing to reduce their carbon emissions. I'll tell you something this is the Walter Mondale ""I'm going to raise your taxes"" moment for Hillary Clinton. I'm going to get rid of jobs, really?  Bill Baldwin: Maybe not and I have some doubts about the wisdom of having green energy displace fossil fuels overnight. Not because of any job counts.  Rich Karlgaard is going to tell you that he's skeptical about solar panels because they're made with robots. What are you going to do about that, Rich? Should we outlaw robots? Should we ban ATMs?Rich Karlgaard: No, I don't know what Bill is talking about here.  All I'm saying is you can love green energy, but it isn't going to produce as many jobs because of robotics, because you don't need much labor involved in a windmill once it's been built, and this experiment has already been proven in Spain where all this green energy led to a net loss of jobs.   Steve Forbes: The behavior of Hillary Clinton and these democrats and these environmental extremists are like a religious cult on steroids.  It's not based on science. They don't like coal, they don't like oil. They don't like natural gas. They don't like anything that makes life better.  And so John is right we don't need 13th century technology unless we want to go back to the 13th century. People in free markets, free     people choose what kind of energy they want. They want energy that is cheap, work and clean. Natural gas and others are like that. Coal has been around forever, still vitally important. Get the politics out of it.   NEW CALLS TO LOWER CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATES IN US TO BOOST JOBS AND ECONOMYRich Karlgaard: My gosh, we really need to do that. That needs to be a big priority right now.  The irony here is that companies like apple and google are able to get their tax rates way down by using loopholes. Other companies move offshore, and who is left holding the bag are smaller companies that don't have the legal resources. That's not fair.   Bruce Japsen: Certainly we can look at closing some of the tax loopholes.  Some of these companies do these things; it's an excuse when their profits are getting hit for other reasons.  Walgreens talked about this a couple of years ago, and then we found out that their former CFO made a huge error.  I don't know if it's necessarily these companies are doing it necessarily because of the corporate tax rates.Steve Forbes: It is very simple, and also it means companies can be more prosperous, when they don't have to hand over more of their resources to the government and can invest those resources profitably.    The 12.5 percent Rate in Ireland, juicy though it is, goes down to 6.25 percent if you move certain patents and electrical property to Ireland.  So Ireland gets it, Britain gets it. That's why Avon is moving there.  In the next couple of years Britain is going to reduce their rate from 20 percent down to 17 percent.  This is a case where less is more.  You'll collect more, have a more prosperous economy by not having businesses have to go through contortions to avoid the extortionist rate we have in the U.S.Elizabeth Macdonald: The thing is the GOP and they've said this themselves, they have to make this case and not sound like wonky bookkeepers. Even the rock band U2's, Bono said look at what we're doing in Ireland, and then you have high tax in California, the governor there Jerry Brown saying well now apple is an Irish company.  He just joked about that.    Sabrina Schaeffer: And Lizzie hit the nail on the head.  The real problem, the real disconnect is that 64 percent of Americans believe that corporations aren't paying their fair share. This is a serious challenge in the court of public opinion.  So, if they want to bring corporations back, republicans need to make the very personal case to Americans that they're going to bring jobs back that they're going to bring opportunities back because that's what voters care about.Bill Baldwin: We should lower the rates and close the loopholes.  Apple should be paying U.S. corporate taxes on its worldwide  income, a portion the U.S., on the basis of jobs and sales, and that way apple could no longer be saying, well, all of our profits are being made by our patents, and the patents they just so happen to be located in a satellite.REFUND PICKSElizabeth Macdonald: Syngenta (SYT)Bill Baldwin: Devon (DVN)"

This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" October 13, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Breaking tonight with the sexual abuse accusations against him mounting, an angry Donald Trump is fighting back tonight with some explosive allegations of his own, making charges that are riling up his supporters and starting to scare some of his critics.Welcome to ""The Kelly File,"" everyone. I'm Megyn Kelly. With less than a week to go until the next and last presidential debate, Mr. Trump confronting serious new allegations head on. Over the last few days, more women are coming forward formally accusing him of sexual assault. The claims range from alleged groping incident on an airplane 30 years ago to multiple episodes inside Trump's Florida home over the last decade. Hours ago at a campaign rally in Florida, Donald Trump responding, not only denying the allegations but turning on his critics, and accusing the media, Washington and the Clinton campaign of working together to bring him down.  Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The claims are preposterous, ludicrous and defy truth, common sense and logic. The corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism. They're a political special interest, the Clinton machine is at the center of this power stretch. Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends and her donors.(CROWD CHANTING ""LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP!"")TRUMP: Honestly, she should be locked up.(CROWD CHEERING)She should be.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: We have a huge lineup for you tonight and a lot of ground to cover.  In moments, we'll be joined by JD Heyman, the deputy editor of People. One of his reporters is now accusing Donald Trump on the record of forcibly kissing her more than a decade ago.Next, we'll speak to Marc Thiessen and former Clinton campaign travelling Press Secretary Mo Elleithee on what we're seeing in the polls tonight.Plus, Katrina Pierson, the Trump campaign national spokesperson is here and then Charles Krauthammer takes a step back on how presidential campaign unlike any other could be changing this country. But first we begin with new reaction to Donald Trump's remarks today, which some in the media criticize as hateful, contemptuous and even dangerous.David Wohl is an attorney. Ben Shapiro is an editor-in-chief of DailyWire.com. Great to see you both.DAVID WOHL, ATTORNEY: Hi, Megyn.And Ben is the author of the new book, ""True Allegiance."" Ben, let me start with you because the anti-defamation league is coming out, speaking about Donald Trump's language in part of that that sound bite you just heard there saying, we really need to avoid rhetoric and troops that have been historically used against Jews and spur anti-Semitism. Keep hate out of this campaign. Your thoughts on Mr. Trump's tone and rhetoric today.  BEN SHAPIRO, DAILYWIRE.COM EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: I mean, I'm more concerned about the fact that Donald Trump is constantly talking in terms of conspiracies that are going to overwhelm the American voter, and actually is a tactic of the left to talk about how the American people are being victimized by some shadowy forces beyond their control. And what you really need to do is just hand power to a very powerful gentleman to fix all of that. That's what troubles me more. As far as the illusion to international bankers, I assume he's talking about Goldman Sachs. But again, this sort of large conspiracies, these conspiracies at large don't speak well of his campaign and they don't speak well of the people who are buying into them.  KELLY: Before I get to David, Ben, you used to work for Breitbart and the head of Breitbart, the former head, the CEO, Steve Bannon is now running the Trump campaign or CEO of the campaign. The critics say that that speech today was straight out of the, quote, ""alt-right play book,"" that messaging that we're hearing which has been criticized as, you know, having racist undertones, having anti-Semitic undertones. Did you hear that or is that not fair?SHAPIRO: Well, I'm always hesitant to cite anti-Semitism as the rational for rhetoric like that. I will say that Donald Trump's campaign and what he has been doing since he hired Steve Bannon has been sort of a burn it down mentality. This is no longer about winning an election. This is now about rallying a certain group of supporters in order to believe that Donald Trump is really being destroyed by some evil conspiracy that stabbed him in the back. He's creating a stab in the back myth before he loses so that he can go back to those people and then mark it off of them or declare victory even if he gets destroyed at the polls.  KELLY: What do you make of it David because, you know, he's obviously feeling angry and feeling conspired against and one gets the impression he can feel it slipping away right now. But that, you know, query whether that kind of a speech is going to help him win voters. What are your thoughts?  WOHL: Well, Megyn, I mean, honestly if you look at the media and the WikiLeaks releases. The substance of the WikiLeaks releases. If this was against Donald Trump and he had done all the WikiLeaks exposing, the media would be talking about nothing else, the idea that they're talking about the women, for example, the women who were obviously collaborated and coordinated to make these simultaneous statements about events that happened ten, 30 years ago, you know, the idea that they're giving that all of the attention instead of the extraordinary weight that the WikiLeaks statements and release of the e-mails have, it's ridiculous.I mean, the Clinton campaign operatives dirty fingerprints are all over these women's statements, their interviews. There's no question about it.  This is all about trying to destroy Donald Trump. And if these were credible, Megyn, why weren't there any criminal complaints filed? Why weren't there any civil suits? Why weren't there complaints to the Trump organization?KELLY: David, you know very well, you know very well the reason for that.  You know the fact that a woman doesn't come forward when she's been sexually grope doesn't mean it didn't happen. Most women --WOHL: But on an airplane?KELLY: -- suddenly moved past it, with an understanding that they likely will be attacked brutally if they come forward especially against a powerful man.  WOHL: Okay. But Megyn, they release -- okay, but that's one thing. But to release a statements 30 days from the election when the WikiLeaks stuff is coming down on Hillary Clinton like a comet out of the sky --KELLY: Uh-hm.WOHL: I'm sorry, I've got a big problem with that.  KELLY: Ben, you know, here on this program, we've covered WikiLeaks. That was our lead last night. We covered the Trump's stuff too. But we did two blocks on WikiLeaks before we even got to Trump. There is a point, that the WikiLeaks news has been largely ignored by many media outlets.  SHAPIRO: I mean, I agree that the WikiLeaks things has been under-covered by the media. There is no question. But the idea that the media was never going to be against the Republican nominee. They weren't going to try and launch them sort of an October surprise on the Republican nominee. They weren't going to try and launch them sort of October surprise on the Republican nominee. I'm not sure what world we're living in anymore. I mean, yes, Donald Trump has been attacked by the media.But the person who is mainly responsible for stabbing Donald Trump is Donald Trump who continues to stab himself in the chest with his own libido. You know you do that for 20 years and then you're surprised when somebody brings it up a month before the election. The problem for Trump here is that it's not a he said/she said. It's a he said and she confirmed. I mean, if there's no tape last Friday, and then he's not pressed by Anderson Cooper and to denying that any of this activity took place last Sunday. I mean, I predicted that night that the media was going to drop every woman who he'd ever kissed forcibly on him this week.I mean, it was obvious where this was going. Trump should have known it was going this way. And to claim that it's some sort of victimization campaign with Trump at the center, I mean, welcome to politics.  KELLY: But, you know, David, what we do know about these women --WOHL: Well, welcome to dirty politics.  KELLY: One of the women who spoke out to the New York Times said, she called them. And, you know, she saw Trump's denial in the debate and she decided she would call them. The People magazine said she had the same reaction.WOHL: Yes.KELLY: So, there isn't evidence of collusion. You just suspect it but there's no evidence of it.  WOHL: For them to all come out simultaneously in big media --KELLY: Right after he denied it at the debate.  WOHL: But Megyn, 30 years ago. I mean, there has to be some level of assessment of this. She has no credibility. She said she was on first class on an airliner when Trump sexually assaulted, groped her, and nothing ever happened, no one ever saw it, there were no witnesses, absolute garbage -- Megyn.  KELLY: You know, David, can I just ask you? Let me just ask you, was there a witness to Juanita Broaddrick?WOHL: Megyn, I don't know but there's a lot more attention --KELLY: The Trump supporters are very willing to belief her. So, you can't have it both ways.WOHL: No, no, no, no. Did Bill Clinton ever deny Juanita Broaddrick? I don't recall him ever denying Juanita Broaddrick or any of the other women.  I just remember his silence. The great thing though Megyn --KELLY: Okay. So, you have to complain, you have to make a record of it when it happens otherwise it didn't happen. Good to know.WOHL: Bingo. Thank you.KELLY: I know as a lawyer, I know you know that's not true. I know you know that's not true. We're going to have more on that with another panel but it's good to see you both.WOHL: Well, but that's an issue of credibility if you don't. That's all.  KELLY: We also have brand new Fox News poll out tonight showing a big change in this race. In a four-way contest, Hillary Clinton is now leading Trump nationally by seven points. She had only a two-point lead just last week and that enthusiasm gap that is plagued Mrs. Clinton this entire race is apparently gone.Marc Thiessen is a Fox News contributor, and American Enterprise Institute scholar. Mo Elleithee is a former traveling press secretary for Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. Also founding director, executive director of Georgetown Universities. And that's too long.(LAUGHTER)Let's talk about the polls. Let's just start with the enthusiasm gap there Marc that we just talked about. That was the thing -- there it is right there. That was the thing he really had over her. He used to have, look at that, 13-point advantage over her, just October 3rd. And now she has a three-point advantage over him on enthusiasm. Your thoughts.MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it's hard to be enthusiastic about your candidate when he's constantly imploding in front of you. I mean, if you just look at what's happened in the last few weeks, Donald Trump, just the last few weeks, Donald Trump had a terrible debate, first debate with Hillary Clinton where he constantly interrupted her, then he spent days attacking Miss Universe tweeting out 3:00 a.m. about her sex tapes.Then a video emerges about him bragging about groping women, then he spends days attacking Republicans who distance themselves from him because of his bragging about groping women and the result is, he's going down in the polls, he's going down 12 points among women age 45 and older, ten points among suburban women, seven points among white women, the college degrees, down six points with GOP women.The only thing that's shocking is that it hasn't gone down further. So, you know, you've got a situation where you have Hillary Clinton is the second most unpopular person ever in the history to run for president but she's got the luck of being running against the most unpopular person ever to run for president of the United States.  KELLY: Uh-hm. Mo, you tell me. Because you've actually run these presidential campaigns and others like them. What are we seeing now? I mean, do you anticipate that Trump is seeing some internal numbers that are even worse than these and that's causing him to lash out like we're hearing? We just got numbers today from Bloomberg on Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania which has been neck in neck just a couple of weeks ago is now Clinton 51, Trump 52. That is almost a 20-point gap in her favor when it comes to women. They're tied when it comes to men. He's got a one-point advantage of her with men. So, I mean, the numbers -- and by way among women, 69 percent of Pennsylvanians say they were bothered a lot by that ""Access Hollywood"" tape.  MO ELLEITHEE, FORMER CLINTON TRAVELING PRESS SECRETARY: Yes. I don't know if he's seeing numbers that are worse. It's hard to believe that he could be. I mean, these numbers are absolutely brutal. And you're right, Megyn.  It's not just the national numbers. We're seeing it in the states. The one battleground state that in the last couple of weeks the Trump people could sort of hang their hat on was Ohio.And the latest poll that came out of Ohio shows that his lead there has evaporated and it's now a dead even. I think he's got a one-point lead there. No Republican has ever lost college educated women, right? That is sort of a bedrock of the Republican coalition and he's losing them badly.  As Marc just pointed out, a double digit drop in the last week.  KELLY: But now, Marc, the Republicans who think that somehow they're going to make a point by voting Democrat up and down the ticket could possibly give Hillary Clinton the House and Senate, your thoughts on that.  STIREWALT: It's an absolute disaster. I mean, you know, if you think about what will happen if Hillary Clinton is elected, and especially if she gets a Republican Senate and Republican House, she's immediately going to replace Justice Antonin Scalia and shift the court in a liberal direction for a generation and she may -- you think about it, Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer and Justice Kennedy are all, you know, in their 80s. They could retire at any time.She could potentially nominate four Supreme Court judges. So, this implosion that Trump is having is horrific. And you look at this race, you know, the FOX News poll shows that almost 50 percent of Republicans wish somebody else was their nominee. And they're right. If Scott Walker was running right now, if Marco Rubio was running right now, George Pataki was running right now. He would be crushing Hillary Clinton. But Donald Trump is the only person who seems to be able to save us, save Hillary Clinton from herself and she --  KELLY: I got to go. But Mo, quickly, do you think there's any chance that the Democrats take the Senate and or the House?ELLEITHEE: I sense sort of a balance in Democrats stop over the past week.  There are a number of Senate races and House races that weren't not necessarily top tier on everyone's radar that suddenly Democrats are starting to invest money in. I don't know that they'll get there. But it's certainly looking doable.  KELLY: Good to see you both.STIREWALT: Thanks, Megyn.ELLEITHEE: Thanks.KELLY: One of the most explosive new charges against Trump comes from a People magazine reporter who says, Trump grabbed her moments after his very pregnant wife Melania left the room, as this reporter was there documenting their one year wedding anniversary at Mar-A-Lago. The deputy editor for People Magazine is here tonight to talk about what's happened since that reporter came forward.  Before the Trump's national spokesperson Katrina Pierson weighs in for the campaign.Plus, you heard Mr. Trump making charges about the media today. Is he right? We'll check the record in moments. Don't go away.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Let's be clear on one thing. The corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight. Just hours after the New York Times reported on two women who claimed they were touch inappropriately by Donald Trump, we also learned of another woman who says she too was assaulted. In 2005, People Magazine writer Natasha Stoynoff was sent to Trump's Florida estate to profile his first year of marriage with wife Melania. It was their anniversary and Melania was very pregnant. During the interview, Stoynoff was briefly left alone with the real-estate mogul while Melania went upstairs to change her wardrobe.That's when the reporter now claims Trump abruptly pinned the reporter against the wall and started kissing her. Stoynoff writes, quote, ""I wasn't in a locker room when he pushed me against the wall. I was in his home as a professional and his beautiful pregnant wife was just upstairs.""  Those accusations are now being addressed by Trump who adamantly denies the charges.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Why didn't they make it part of the story. I was one of the biggest stars on television with ""The Apprentice"" and it would have been one of the biggest stories of the year. And by the way, the area was a public area. People all over the place. These people are horrible people.  They're horrible, horrible liars. And interestingly, it happens to appear 26 days before our very important election. Isn't that amazing?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Joining me now, People Magazine deputy editor JD Heyman. JD, thanks for being here. So, Natasha Stoynoff writes the story now coming out with her story. And first, let me ask you, did you know about this prior to her writing it?JD HEYMAN, DEPUTY EDITOR, PEOPLE: Only very recently. I hadn't known it at the time. We didn't work together at the time. This is something she kept very private for many years.  KELLY: What made her want to write it now?HEYMAN: Well as you said at the top of the hour very clearly, the release of the tapes, the Bush tapes, the ""Access Hollywood"" conversation and what crystalize it for her was when Donald Trump responded to a question at the presidential debate and said that he had never touched or kissed a woman without her consent.KELLY: Uh-hm.HEYMAN: And I think that made her very determined to tell her tale.KELLY: What about earlier in the campaign, JD? You know, his treatment of women has been an issue for a long time. Why didn't she come forward earlier?HEYMAN: Yes. Well, I think the reasons are, the reasons why any woman doesn't come forward. I mean, she has felt a great deal of shame, fear.  She was not a public person in that way. She's not a political person. It bothered her. It increasingly did bother her. But until he actually said those words that we all heard on the tape, she thought that, you know, she might have been an isolated case. She doubted herself. Hearing that articulation of what he said was his behavior confirmed for her that this was what he says, his modus operandi with women.KELLY: Uh-hm.HEYMAN: And that was I think bizarrely a relief for her. And then when she heard him say no, I've never done this. That was I think in a way, a call for her to speak her truth.  KELLY: She writes about it in the piece saying, like many women, I was ashamed and blamed myself for his transgression. I minimized it. It's not like he raped me. I doubted my recollection and my reaction. I was afraid that a famous powerful wealthy man, could and would discredit and destroy me, especially if I got his coveted people feature killed. Today, we heard from Trump on Natasha Stoynoff who she knew fairly well. She had been covering him, she says, for quite a bit --HEYMAN: Yes.KELLY: -- when this happened and this is what he said about her. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Take a look. You take a look. Look at her, look at her words.  You tell me what you think. I don't think so. I don't think so.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Do you think that's a reference to her appearance?HEYMAN: I think it's hard to mistake what that's a reference to. And I would say to your guest at the top of the hour as to why women don't come forward, I think that's a pretty good illustration of why she felt she couldn't come forward.  KELLY: Do you think she's going to come out and speak publicly on camera?HEYMAN: Listen, you know, I don't really know. I think this has been a very difficult journey for her. I think that she, you know, she is a journalist, she is a professional. She works very hard at her job. She had something happen to her that was very upsetting and this is a new role for her. I don't think that she feels quite comfortable being exposed. I think if you asked anybody in that kind of position what that exposure feels like, it's not easy. And, you know, I just want to underscore because this had been discussed earlier within, she had no awareness, we had no awareness of other women's stories. There's no coordination with anyone. This is a person we worked with.KELLY: No one reached out to you from the Clinton campaign?HEYMAN: No. Absolutely not. Absolutely not. We're not a political magazine. We don't have an ideology.KELLY: Yes. People Magazine. You want to sell magazines. You don't want to pick a side in a presidential election. I understand that.  HEYMAN: Well, no, absolutely. And by way, Mr. Trump has been covered pretty glowingly by big media for many, many years. So, I think that's a strange thing to say. This was one person's story, and it was a story we thought was important to tell.  KELLY: Thank you for being here.HEYMAN: Thank you for having me.KELLY: Joining me now, Katrina Pierson, Trump campaign national spokesperson. Katrina, I mean, you tell me, why would this woman, at great harm to herself, come out 11 years later and make an accusation like this and make it up by the whole --KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP CAMPAIGN NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: Well, Megyn, I'm not going to sit here and to pretend to know anyone's motive for doing anything that they do. But what I will say the question is, 26 days before an election. And they all have the exact same answer. And oh, it was the debate. And I'm just not buying that. Mr. Trump has denied this. The witness that she herself has named that come out and denied this publicly.  Said that that never happened, Mr. Trump has never treated a woman that way in his presence --  KELLY: The butler?PIERSON: It would never put him in that position to even deal with anything like this. Absolutely.  KELLY: Yes. But she doesn't say the butler saw Trump in her words trying to shove his tongue down her throat. And she goes on to talk about how then they went back they said, Trump looked at her and said, have you ever been at Peter Luger for steaks, I'll take you. We're going to have an affair, I'm telling you. He referenced the infamous cover of ""The New York Post"" during his affair with Marla Maples and said you remember, best sex I ever had. It's very detailed. I mean I'm not saying it is true. I don't know whether it's true or not true. But it's certainly is very detailed, is it not?PIERSON: Well, I mean, just like within the last hour, Megyn, one of the other women has already changed her story. So no it's definitely not true or true. Mr. Trump has denied this. I take him at his word for this.  KELLY: Why don't you take him at his word on the bus where he says he does do this?  PIERSON: Because that was on a ""Hollywood Access"" bus, he was with another guy in private doing what guys do in a machismo way whether you like it or not, that's how that happens.  KELLY: Yes. But the fact that they were having a private conversation leads many to believe what he said was true. This is guy to guy and Trump saying --(CROSSTALK)PIERSON: No, Megyn.KELLY: I just kissed them without even asking.PIERSON: But two guys that are talking about girls one upping each other, making each other laugh, that's a little bit different. It's not like they were sitting there, plotting on how to actually go about doing it. That's completely different.KELLY: Listen. Let me ask you this.PIERSON: But in this case Mr. Trump has denied these allegations.  KELLY: He's denied them all. And I want to say this. We don't know whether they're true. We don't have time to adjudicate these matters one by one before Election Day.  PIERSON: But that's my point. But that's exactly my point, Megyn --  KELLY: And Trump, no, I'm giving you that. And Trump finds himself in an impossible position because all he can do is say it's not true and we're not going to have an adjudication.  PIERSON: Except the American people, they are a little smarter than that.  Simply because this did happen on the exact same day WikiLeaks has come out. We have found out so much of the corruption and the lies and collusion between the Clinton campaign and media as well as the banks, that they don't want to talk about this. The media doesn't want to talk about this. Megyn, tonight I'm here in North Carolina. Remember the hurricane that came through? Twenty three people died.The Trump women's tour has left the campaign this week because people are hungry here. Food banks are trying to feed 600 families this week and the rivers still haven't receded. So, we have a problem in the United States and our countrymen don't even know that the people of North Carolina need help because they're so focused on what Hillary Clinton wants to allege about Donald Trump. It's disgusting.  KELLY: Katrina, it's good to see you. Thanks for being here.  PIERSON: Great to be here, Megyn. Thank you.KELLY: So, the string of accusations being made against Trump are raising new legal questions about some of these cases. Could actually be considered criminal, sexual assault.Joining me now, Jonathan Turley, professor at the George Washington University School of Law. Good to see you, Professor. So, let's just start with that and then I want to get into Trump's defamation threats, his defamation case he's threatening against the times. Would this be, you know, if he grabbed this People Magazine reporter and kissed her against her will, is that a sexual assault?JONATHAN TURLEY, LAW PROFESSOR, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY: Well, it's certainly can be assault. Usually state laws refer to touching intimate parts, it can be breasts or buttocks. But it can be the level of sexual assault is relatively low. What was described on the plane by Ms. Leeds, it would very likely satisfy that definition. She said that he reached under her skirt and fondled and groped her. That type of thing would satisfy the definition for sexual assault.KELLY: But that happened 30 years ago and would be outside the statute of limitations.  TURLEY: Well, it would be under -- the interesting thing is it's outside the statute of limitations for a civil suit by Leeds. It's actually is not outside of the statute of limitations under the criminal side. Because it occurred on an airplane and federal law doesn't have a statute of limitations I know off for that particular offense.KELLY: No.TURLEY: Now, it wouldn't make a very good case to prosecute because there weren't any witnesses, contemporary objections.KELLY: Right.TURLEY: This is not something that will likely occur. But he's going to be very, very careful. You know, he can tweet himself into litigation.  You know, these women certainly do have seen the statute of limitations expire. But if he attacks these women, they can allege defamation of their own --KELLY: Uh-hm.TURLEY: -- and he could find himself as a defendant in these cases.  KELLY: So, let's talk about that. Because he's coming out. Trump is a litigious man. And, you know, he says, that is protecting his business, people are afraid to come after him because they're going to get sued, and indeed they might. The ""New York Times"" might get sued but that moved by Trump. And he sent a threatening letter to the ""Times"" which first broke the news of these two women, one who says a 22-year-old secretary says, he grabbed her and kissed her in the lobby of Trump Tower and one who say, he groped her 30 years ago on a plane. That case would be fraught with peril for Trump. Explain.  TURLEY: Well, first of all, there is a point where litigious becomes frivolous. And when you file frivolous lawsuits you can be hit by sanctions. I don't see the basis for suing ""The New York Times.""  Ironically, it was ""The New York Times"" that was the plaintiff in ""The New York Times"" versus Sullivan.KELLY: Right.TURLEY: Which set the standard for defamation.KELLY: Which basically means you cannot sue a public figure, a public figure cannot sue for defamation unless you can prove that the person was out to get them and consciously, you know, printed something that was false. But the thing is the times could turn around and seek so much discovery against him because they can defend themselves with the defense that this was true. So, it's going to try to prove that this was true.  TURLEY: Well, it would be a field day for ""The New York Times."" ""The New York Times"" is reporting correctly that women had accused a presidential candidate of sexual assault. Now that's news on any level. I mean you can't argue that that's not news.KELLY: Uh-hm.TURLEY: Now, they weren't saying that these were true. They were reporting something that's very significant. Now, Mr. Trump has every right to say that didn't happen.KELLY: Right.TURLEY: These things happened 30 years ago. But to say that ""The New York Times"" shouldn't report that is a bit odd. Now, you can question the timing. I can see that. But to suggest that a newspaper should be sued for reporting something of that kind is very disturbing.  KELLY: Uh-hm. The ""Times"" is welcoming it. They want him to sue and here we are 26 days out.TURLEY: Yes, they are.KELLY: Great to see you, Professor Turley.  TURLEY: Thanks, Megyn.  KELLY: As we've mentioned, we've seen already some troubling things in this White House race. It's going to a much darker place for both sides in just the last few weeks.Charles Krauthammer is here on how this race may be changing this country.  Stay tuned.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)ANNOUNCER: From the world headquarter of Fox News, it's ""The Kelly File"" with Megyn Kelly.KELLY: New reaction tonight how the media is handling the latest sexual misconduct accusations against Donald Trump. Trump supporters are slamming the allegations and their timing and defending the nominee.Joining me now to discuss it, Monica Crowley, Fox News contributor and former foreign policy assistant to President Nixon, Kat Timpf, National Review reporter and a contributor to The Greg Gutfeld Show on Saturday at 10 p.m., and Krystal Ball, a Clinton supporter and senior fellow at the New Leaders Council. Great to see you all.Monica, you've been a defender of Trump all along and yet also a defender of women. And so I'm very curious as to your take on this. I mean, you have at least six women now coming forward on the record. Do you think it was all coordinated? Is that -- do you believe that?MONICA CROWLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER FOREIGN POLICY ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT NIXON: Well presidential campaigns have always involved some October surprises to try to derail other candidates. I mean, that's just the way the game is played, whether you like it or not. But when you look at the pattern here, Megyn, what you see is that three days before the first debate the ""The New York Times"" publishes the tax return story.And then two days before the second debate you have the Access Hollywood tape leaked even though NBC News had it since August. And now a couple of days before the third debate, you have the ""The New York Times"" publishing these allegations from these women. So it does look like a coordinated attack.And given the WikiLeaks disclosures of the very scandalous collusion between the media and the Hillary Clinton campaign, I think it does raise a lot of issues. This is not a coincidence. But every presidential campaign and candidate have to deal with things that are thrown at them. The question is not what they're hit with. The question is how they respond.KELLY: Kat, you went on a tweet storm last night that got a lot of attention because you -- you were taking real issue with the attempt to discredit all of these accusers by just saying why did they wait so long, why did they wait so long, why did they wait so long.KAT TIMPF, NATIONAL REVIEW REPORTER AND CONTRIBUTOR TO THE GREG GUTFELD SHOW: Yeah, a coordinated attack. That's really taking it pretty far. It's typical for women in this situation to wait so long. The whole reason that powerful women -- powerful men go after less powerful women is because they don't have power and they can't say anything.Of course when that guy is about to become the president and when they have an audio tape of him bragging about what he did to them, that might spur them. And yes, when one comes forward, it does make it easier for others to come forward. I think that you should at least consider it's possible that maybe a 22-year-old didn't at the time feel comfortable taking on a billionaire with a lot of influence and power when she was a secretary.And at least consider that and think about it before making accusations like saying it's a coordinated attack. These women aren't having fun. Look at my twitter mentions for even just saying that, a party you want to be a part of.KELLY: By the same token, Krystal, the same thing is true of Juanita Broaddrick and Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey. They're getting attacked too, and their stories completely dismissed.KRYSTAL BALL, CLINTON SUPPORTER, SENIOR FELLOW AT NEW LEADERS COUNCIL: That's absolutely the case, Megyn, and here is the saying. I'm not here to defend Bill Clinton and I'm not voting for Bill Clinton this November. I mean, right now, what we have is a presidential candidate who brags about sexually assaulting women and now we've had woman after woman come out and confirm exactly what he himself confessed.I mean, in terms of timing, imagine that you're an ordinary citizen living a private life. Can you imagine how scary it would be to inject yourself in the middle of this campaign and be scrutinized, having your public information, private contact details released and everybody decides whether you're enough for King Donald? I can understand a lot of these women.KELLY: Monica, I'll give you the last word, but especially when you've already seen, some very prominent women, come under attack relentlessly, who, you know, he never let up on for months and months and months. And I'm not just referring to yours truly. You tell me how, you know, this 22-year- old secretary was probably feeling about coming forward and accusing him.CROWLEY: Yeah, look, I don't know and none of us know the truth about any of this. We weren't in the room so we don't know. We are in a he said, she said situation. I just think from a political standpoint, it is a question of how Donald Trump is going to handle this going forward. There could be something of a backlash effect if voters start to perceive that this is a pile on and it could actually perform the impossible.TIMPF: More evidence against somebody -- you're saying more evidence against somebody is going to make people think he's not guilty? What planet.(CROSSTALK)CROWLEY: Remember that the backlash actually worked in Bill Clinton's favor.KELLY: Go ahead.TIMPF: I saying more evidence, more evidence, more people accusing him, you think it's going to make him look more sympathetic?CROWLEY: That's what happened with Bill Clinton.KELLY: Okay.TIMPF: No.CROWLEY: It had a backlash effect.KELLY: We're going to leave that. Thank you, ladies. Up next, Charles Krauthammer on 2016 and America.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: As we've been discussing tonight over the past couple of weeks, we've already seen a troubling White House race go to a much darker place on both sides. While the critics have had a field day with Trump supporters and his treatment of women, the Clinton campaign has some serious issues of its own, including questions about her honesty, her foundation, and how her team views people of faith.Joining me now, syndicated columnist and Fox News contributor, Charles Krauthammer. Charles, good to see you. If there's one thing I hear from people more than anything else on the streets these days is that they just feel disgusted that they can't wait for this thing to end and they feel, they feel low, they feel grossed out by the state of our electoral politics. Do you think it's particularly bad this time this year?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well it is particularly bad. This is the, I would say, lowest least honorable political campaign I've seen in 35 years. But the good news is that it is reflected in the fact that these are the two most unpopular candidates in American history. There is a sense in the country that this is particularly bad. It would be worse if that weren't true.And I think what you have also is on two sides the worst of our politics. With the Clintons and what we're seeing in the e-mails is mostly insider baseball. But it shows the utter rank cynicism of Hillary Clinton and that's one of the reasons her ratings are so low. On the Trump side, it's now gone way beyond cynicism into squaller. That's really where we are.And he's insisting on bringing down the house upon him like Solomon, meaning bringing her down, her husband down, the republican party down. This is an all-out fight of a man with his back against the wall. And you are right, after a day or two of this people feel they want to take a shower. But I would tell you this does not -- there are going to be people who are going to draw historical lessons from this. I think not.This is an example of what can happen in a celebrity-soaked culture, in a place where reality television has such a great influence, and we are seeing a kind of monstrous soap opera on the political stage. I suspect future candidates are not going to want to repeat either of their performances.KELLY: How did we get to this point, right? We were just talking about the race in 2012 when it was like being capital and, you know, whether Barack Obama was running an empirical presidency, right? How did we fall so far so fast?KRAUTHAMMER: Well because on one side you have a very cynical politician in Hillary Clinton who doesn't have a message because, as we see in her own e- mails, they're not even sure why she's running with, what she stands for, et cetera. It's all contrive, all thought out. On the other side, we have a reality television star who has no qualities that would make him fit for the office, is without a doubt the least qualified and the least tempered mentally fit for office that we've seen in a long time.You put them together and you have a campaign with no substance. It might have started out with substance, you know, and essentially you could say immigration or trade. Essentially what is happening to some parts of the white electorate, also nonwhite who are being left behind, that's fine. But we are not even near discussing that now.We are now at the bottom of the barrel. That's how we got here. It's the choice of the candidates. And it is quite remarkable that the parties have elected the weakest possible candidates for their side and the only one who would have a chance of winning because the other side is nominated is a weaker candidate.KELLY: Now with 26 days to go, you can feel the populous bracing itself, Charles, bracing itself for what's next at the debate or is there another October surprise, or how low can they go. Have we hit rock bottom or are we going even deeper?KRAUTHAMMER: No. There is no -- in this campaign there is no visible bottom. We'll only hit bottom on election day because there will be no time to go any lower. But the trajectory is only one way. And Trump is ready to bring down the house. Bring down almost literally the house around him. He's bringing out, you know, parading around with accusers of Clinton, fine.But then when other people accuse him of similar behavior, he calls them liars and promises to bring evidence. Why doesn't he bring it now? Isn't this time to bring it? Look, this has sunk so low that I agree with you, I don't know of anybody who doesn't want to see this end as quickly as possible.But again, I don't believe in apocalyptic thinking. This is not something people are going to draw great statements about our politics. Yes, it is expressing a lot of this sort of the celebrity madness, the fact that Trump won the nomination in the first place. But I think Americans -- Churchill once said, Americans always end up doing the right thing after they've tried everything else first.KELLY: Right.KRAUTHAMMER: Well this is trying everything else first. We are right in the middle of it and it is ugly.KELLY: Perhaps the right thing is coming our way, when and in what form remains to be seen. Charles, great to see you.KRAUTHAMMER: My pleasure.KELLY: Imperial presidency, not empirical. Imperial, like a king. Up next, speaking of kings, Brian Kilmeade is here on the sudden downfall, downfall of the once beloved Ken Bone. Say it ain't so. That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(START VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One more question from Ken Bone about energy policy. Ken?KEN BONE, BREAKOUT FIGURE OF SECOND PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: With that one question, Ken Bone went went from audience member at last week's debate to instant media star. But in a tale as old as time, it wasn't long before the hero became the villain. Brian Kilmeade, co-host of ""Fox and Friends"" is here on the rise and fall of Ken Bone. Brian?BRIAN KILMEADE, CO-HOST, ""FOX & FRIENDS"": This isn't an easy story for me to do but someone has to do it. All right. Let's start with the back story, cue the music. Ken Bone gets the word that he's need for the audience. Yes, he's an undecided voter. He is one of 40 to make the cut, 67 million people will be watching. Ken knows exactly what he's going to wear. He's going to be the olive green suit.The problem, he has gained 75 pounds since that picture. He rips the seat of the pants of that suit. Ken needs his second best outfit. There is only one stop to go, one place to go, Kohl's, where he gets a sweater that almost fits him. It's a red sweater and he pulls it over and quickly put himself to the studio, where in that red sweater, he sits for one hour.For one hour, he sits there and waits for his moment. And then suddenly, it happens, cue the different music. He would take the energy topic and suddenly America would fall in love with the man, with the square-like, boxy-figure figure and a unique look. He would have the instant fame of a Kardashian.He would do interview after interview. And suddenly, he had sponsorship deal. How do I know? When asked if Ken had decided who to vote for, he said, yeah, Uber, Uber Select. That's why Uber Select is his choice. He suddenly has sponsorship deal. And he has a Halloween costume, it's a female costume.KELLY: No.KILMEADE: And before it could hit the shelves, it flew off the shelves. There is. Exactly like Ken Bone. Much better abs than Ken Bone, I might add. Cue the third selection of music. Disaster strikes. A headline hit. The New York Daily News decide that Ken Bone is not just undecided, he's an ignorant bone head.KELLY: Oh, come on.KILMEADE: . because he asked a bad question. His sweater didn't fit. And his question could have been answered by looking at the website. He's got all the clicks in the world and it shows that the media that created Trump created Ken Bone. Therefore, we are saying his star has dimmed, sooner it will be destroyed. Welcome to America in 2016. Good-bye, Ken Bone. We barely knew you.KELLY: Nicely done, Brian Kilmeade. Come on, don't be shy. Brian Kilmeade is here today watching. I can see this is going to be the basis for your next novel. Ken Bone is going to be a star yet. Thank you, sir.KILMEADE: I got to go.KELLY: We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: So to hear a surprising story about Brian Kilmeade, yours truly, and Donald Trump, you need to pre-order my book ""Settle for More"" right now at barnesandnoble.com or amazon.com.
