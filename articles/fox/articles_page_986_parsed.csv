This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MARTHA MACCALLUM, GUEST HOST: Breaking tonight, is the momentum changing as the murder of a U.S. journalist may lead America into a larger war against the world's most brutal terror group? Welcome to ""The Kelly File"" tonight everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum in for Megyn Kelly.So over the past 72 hours we have seen a serious shift in the tone of the Obama administration after the terror army known as ISIS beheads an American journalist in a gruesome video.On Wednesday, James Foley was memorialized by President Obama, but the president's remarks seemed to suggest that the U.S. would simply stay the course to fight Foley's killers.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Governments and peoples across the Middle East, there has to be a common effort to extract this cancer so that it does not spread. Friends and allies around the world, we share a common security and a common set of values that are rooted in the opposite of what we saw yesterday. And we will continue to confront this hateful terrorism and replace it with a sense of hope and civility.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Well, then yesterday just 24 hours after the president made those remarks we heard some of the most strong language that this administration has used on this issue. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel suggested that ISIS is unlike anything that we have ever seen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHUCK HAGEL, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: ISIL is a sophisticated and well-funded as any group that we have seen. They're beyond just a terrorist group. They marry ideology, a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess. They are tremendously well funded. This is beyond anything that we've seen. So, we must prepare for everything.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: We must prepare for everything. What does that mean from Chuck Hagel? The media instantly seized on those remarks. But it seems that the White House was listening as well. They began to scramble together a last-minute press briefing earlier today to admit that Jim Foley's death was not only an act of terror but that ISIS does present such a serious threat that we need to be, as Chuck Hagel said, ready for anything even a September 11th-style attack.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BEN RHODES, DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: When you see somebody killed in such a horrific way, that represents a terrorist attack.UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Could they pull off a 9/11-size attack? Are they capable of that?RHODES: Look, to-date we have not seen them focus on that type of planning. But that doesn't mean we're not going to be very mindful that they could quickly aim to pivot to attacks against western targets outside of the region. And so, again, this is something we're going to monitor very closely because we certainly take seriously the fact that this is an organization that has a cadre of fighters who were clearly willing to do horrific things as we saw on that video and as we seen as a massacre in civilians in Iraq. They have significant stream of funding that they've acquired over the last year or two. And, again, if they show the intent or they show plotting against the United States, we'll be prepared to deal with that if necessary.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Chris Stirewalt and Colonel Oliver North are here to tackle the political and military implications here tonight as the scene has changed dramatically in the last 24 to 48 hours. Let's get started with Chris Stirewalt tonight, our Fox News digital politics editor. Chris, you know, we have heard from Ben Rhodes, as you just saw, we have heard from Chuck Hagel on this. We have not so far heard from the president in these new starker terms. When do you expect we will?CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, look, Colonel North may say something that I don't know because that's his area of expertise, but as far as I can tell nothing has changed here except for the politics. The situation on the ground seems materially the same. The political situation is getting worse for the administration as fissures erupt as you start to see a split between the Pentagon and the White House in terms of the military brass pushing and saying, look, Mr. President, we're all sorry when bad things happen to good people. But we have a real problem on the ground.And we have a real need to start getting involved. When you see that kind of pushback inside the administration, when you see people going in public, Cabinet secretaries going in public, and basically a rebuttal from the Pentagon to Eric Holder who talked about this in law enforcement terms, when you see pushback from the Pentagon, you can tell that the real dysfunction of a second term presidency has set in badly at this White House.MACCALLUM: Yes. And we have heard that there was disgruntlement at the Pentagon. That they felt that they were given a mission but they were not given a strategy. I mean, basically the last thing that we've heard from the president on this is protect Erbil and protect the Yazidis. And then we were going to protect everybody on the mountain top and then we decided that the mountain top was OK. And then the next thing you know we have this horrific beheading of this journalist of James Foley.And to watch his parents today talking about the experience that they have been going through and to listen to their son -- to them talk about their son, Chris, is just so incredibly heartbreaking. But, you know, you wonder why the White House appears to be once again about 24 to 48 hours behind everybody else on what's actually going on?STIREWALT: I don't know that there has ever been an administration this reactive. They seem to live on about 48-hour news cycles gasping from one thing to the next. Can we get through this, oh, did the president play golf, oh, how did it look, oh, did he wear a tie. And they seem to be always careening from this problem to that problem and trying to answer the critics without looking like they're answering the critics. What ends up happening for this president most often and we saw it in Afghanistan, we saw it in Libya is he gets dragged into conflicts by political pressure, foreign and domestic as the military, as public sentiment as is in the case here and his European allies. Push, push, push. But if you get in that way, it's unlikely you're going to build the political will at home necessary to carry out whatever that mission is.MACCALLUM: Yes. You have to have that political will yourself before you can sell it to the American people. And that is what we don't know at this point. Chris, thank you very much.STIREWALT: You bet.MACCALLUM: Joining me for more on this now, Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, host of ""War Stories"" and author of ""Counterfeit Lies."" Colonel North, welcome, good to have you here tonight.LT. COL. OLIVER NORTH, HOST, ""WAR STORIES"": Martha, I'm going to be less charitable than Chris. I think you've got an administration that is looking through bifurcated lens at what's going on. Our military objectives in Iraq are limited to protecting U.S. personnel installations and supporting humanitarian ops is what been also said this afternoon when he was giving that briefing. So the White House is not changed. What's happened is the Pentagon -- Secretary Hagel and General Dempsey had just come from a briefing, the likes of which the president gets every single day.It's called a presidential daily brief, if he bothers to read it or take the brief. All this information has been there for months. It's exacerbated now by the terrible murder. And it's not an execution. It's a murder of Jim Foley. The bottom-line is they have not changed their mind at the White House one bit as to what's happening. Unfortunately they're totally out of touch with reality, Martha.MACCALLUM: You know, you hear discussion about coalition building and talking to our partners. And there was so much criticism of the president for on the same day that this news broke about James Foley, to speak about it and then go straight to the golf course. And, you know, but you wonder, it's fine to play golf on your vacation, but when is the work actually happening? When are the phone calls being made to Angela Merkel, to the other people who need to be involved in this discussion, to our allies in the Middle East as well? I mean, this is by everyone's estimation except perhaps the White House, this is an emergency situation that needs to be attacked immediately, is it not?NORTH: Absolutely. And that's exactly the briefing that General Dempsey and Secretary Hagel got just before they walked into that briefing. The ISIL terror army, that's what it is, more than 20,000 strong, is bigger, better funded, better armed and deadlier than any adversary we've faced literally since the last war called Vietnam. There are 3,000-plus ISIL terrorist who is carry U.S. and European passports. The Pentagon says, we may put more security personnel in. They're going to have to put more. Here's what they ought to be doing real quickly.MACCALLUM: Yes.NORTH: Number one, order a carrier strike group to the Mediterranean and a marine expeditionary brigade to back them up in the Mediterranean. Number two, no safe havens. They have to attack ISIL's high-value targets, logistic sites and command control in communications nodes in Iraq and in Syria. Does anybody remember Anwar Awlaki, we took out an American citizen in Yemen, at the direction of this president with a hell fire missile, then we damn well ought to be able to find al Baghdadi and do the same thing to him.MACCALLUM: Yes.NORTH: Provide the Peshmerga with the heavy weapons and ammo and mobility that they're not getting through Baghdad. I saw, again, today the National Security briefing they're talking about shipping more supplies to the Peshmerga through Baghdad. It doesn't get there. Put joint tactical air controllers and forward air controllers on the ground with the Peshmerga forces and start now at rebuilding the secular Sunni tribes in Anbar. The ones that were there with us during their wakening.MACCALLUM: Colonel North, I mean, we heard a very different tune today from the Defense Secretary Hagel and also from Dempsey. So we'll see if the cart can, you know, pull the wagon so to speak in all of this. Colonel North, thank you very much. Good to have you here tonight.NORTH: Before it gets here. Right.MACCALLUM: Yes.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.HOWARD KURTZ, HOST: We are live in Philadelphia, at the Democratic Convention, where Hillary Clinton and her new running mate Tim Kaine will be ready to counter the Republicans' week in Cleveland in the face of new and embarrassing e-mails hack of the DNC that's already shattering the facade of party unity.Clinton's announcement followed a GOP convention that most of the media portrayed as a badly managed mess and Trump's lengthy prime time speech which were mostly negative reviews from the press and the pundits.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper.VAN JONES, CNN: What Donald Trump did tonight was a disgrace. He was describing some ""Mad Max"" America.MATT LAUER, NBC: This wasn't the ""Shining City on the Hill, this wasn't ""Morning in America."" He sounded like a wartime president last night.CHUCK TODD, NBC NEWS: It was just very dark.NICOLLE WALLACE, NBC NEWS: The Republican Party that I worked for, for two decades, died in this room tonight. We are now represented as a party by a man who believes in protectionism, isolationism, and nativism.BRIAN KILMEADE: That was as impassioned as I've seen him period and as focus. I think if he had a message it got across.TODD: Did you think it was a little dark?TRUMP: No, I thought it was very optimistic. To me, it was an optimistic speech because...TODD: What makes it optimistic?TRUMP: Because we're going to solve the problems.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: The big story today, WikiLeaks has dumped nearly 20,000 hacked e- mails from the DNC. They show party officials trying to spin journalists but also how some treated Bernie Sanders with utter disdain. CFO Brad Marshall writing in May talking about Bernie Sanders, ""Can we get someone to ask his belief? Does he believe in a God? He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist.""Joining us now to analyze the convention coverage here in Philadelphia is Tucker Carlson, co-host of ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" and editor of The Daily Caller; Kirsten Powers, a Fox News analyst and columnist for USA Today and James Rosen, Fox News chief Washington correspondent.  I will also look at the big story involving Fox News events surrounding the resignation of Chairman Roger Ailes in just a few moments. Tucker, why is the press not going utterly haywire over these leaked e-mails that show that what Sanders and his people said all along was true, that Debbie Wasserman Schultz and her DNC were trashing him and helping Hillary?TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS: It's a great story. It confirms what the Bernie people have said for months was the real reason. I can only go on intuition, but the question I've been asking myself the last years, when did the press see it as their role to protect the prerogative of the powerful? Actually I think that's part of it.They identify with Hillary Clinton. They're from the same class, from the same world. They disdain (ph) assumptions. Bernie Sanders is this kind of weird, elderly guy with nose hair, they don't relate to him at all, and in the end their gut instincts have kicked in and they're on her team. That's my personal view. Can't prove it.KURTZ: DNC official Brad Marshall has apologized for writing this e-mail about Sanders. And Debbie Wasserman Schultz as we've just announced recently is not going to speak at this convention because she is such a divisive symbol. So, I don't see this on the front page of the New York Times and Washington Post. I searched the New York Times homepage and finally found it at the bottom of some menu. Should this be a bigger story?KIRSTEN POWERS, FOX NEWS ANALYST: It should be a bigger story. I suspect it will become a bigger story because they're going to be pressured into covering it. What is the explanation for it? It's a huge story. When you have -- you had the Bernie Sanders people making this accusation for the entire election season demanding that she step down, saying that Hillary, you know, should basically get rid of her.And now they have it in black and white. I mean, it's incontrovertible. I think incontrovertible before frankly, that the DNC was carrying water for Hillary, but now, there's no getting around it.KURTZ: It really was kind of obvious in the debate schedules and everything else, but the way -- the disparaging way which they talk about Bernie Sanders in these e-mails. And by the way, I'm not a fan of hacked e-mails and I think it's terrible and it goes to any organization to find embarrassing e-mails, but is this -- I guess the question is we - the press has kind of describing Democratic Party as being together now, unity, it's going to be a great four days in Philadelphia. Does this really crack that?JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS: Well, I was covering the DNC Rules Committee session yesterday where we (ph) had this big fight over the role of superdelegates in the Democratic Party, and the Sanders wanted them eliminated or their power constrained and the Clinton folks were fighting all of that.And it was clear to me just being in the room that these WikiLeaks e-mails had cast a sinister poll (ph) over the entire thing and early attempts to broker a deal between Robbie Mook, the head of the Clinton campaign and Jeff Weaver, the head of the Sanders campaign, I was told to have gone south precisely because of these WikiLeaks e-mails.KURTZ: There are also journalists in these e-mails. So, Politico's Ken Vogel had sent to DNC a copy before publication of a story by Hillary and campaign finance with his note ""per agreement, let me know if you have anything to push back on"" and then the DNC official said, ""he shared this ahead of time, let me know."" He's like talking to somebody else at the DNC. ""Let me know if you see anything missing and I'll push back."" You see any problem with that?ROSEN: There are circumstances under which reporters will see fit to share their copy with a source prior to even submitting it to their editors. They want to make sure they're getting it right. I know Ken Vogel. I think he's an exceptional reporter. He has a specialty in the role of money and politics.The broader point here -- the broader takeaway is Andy Warhol said famously said that, ""In the future, everyone will be famous for 15 minutes."" My addendum to that is yes, and in the 16th minute everyone becomes Richard Nixon. You have all of your tapes, your texts, your e-mails and everything, just (inaudible) in to public view, and you're crucified on that basis, welcome Ken Vogel.KURTZ: Well, a political executive told me that Ken made an agreement to share the story to confirm facts and figures in a complex story about campaign finance. Politico doesn't typically do this the official told me, nor does Ken but in this circumstance he did to make sure we had it -- actually we had it right. You're laughing. You're in one of those e-mails.CARLSON: Because they -- I am, where they're attacking me, I'm proud to say. You know, I mean because -- I'm not attacking Ken Vogel. I can do this and make a pretty good report. My playbook (ph) carries water for Hillary every day. You've read Politico? It's unbelievable. I've been there like flat out rooting for Hillary Clinton so, I mean, you know maybe this was legitimate and their coverage is not.POWERS: I don't think -- I think that sometimes reporters do this just to make sure they're getting things right.KURTZ: And it's part of their gimmick (ph).POWERS: It is complex.KURTZ: Yeah.POWERS: I mean, I write a column and I've on occasion, done this. If it's something that involves really complex legal arguments or something and you just want to make sure, and I will -- but I will say I'm not changing anything for opinion, but if you have a substantive issue...KURTZ: Like a factual...POWERS: ...factual, and 99 percent of the time no one has anything to say, but you know, so on occasion this happens so I don't think in itself its...KURTZ: Also fascinating is Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic Chairman, complaining to NBC's Chuck Todd about all the criticism from Mika Brzezinski, the liberal on the MSNBC morning show, ""this must stop."" And Chuck tried to broker a phone call, it didn't happen. It just shows you that they don't like the criticism from the press on the Democratic side anyone than the Republican.Let's move to Donald Trump. I mean, let's start with the speech. The media pretty much savaged that speech -- it was too dark, it was too scary, it was fear mongering, and you think that reflected an honest assessment of -- it wasn't the usual speech, it was or anti-Trump sentiment?CARLSON: Obviously the latter. It was a great speech in this way, Trump explained what he thinks. So you don't have to agree with any of it but how nice was it to hear a candidate lay out his views. Trump is terrible at explaining what he thinks. He's always often on some tangent attacking some irrelevant person. Finally, you have 90 minutes of Trump laying out Trump's philosophy.I was so struck in the -- nobody assessed that. Nobody assessed it was all on the aesthetics then, whoa! He makes -- I live in a rich neighborhood and everything is fine. What the hell is he talking about? So out of touch, but also so childish in their analysis, like, is what he said true or not? They didn't even address it.KURTZ: Some of the liberal commentators didn't really expect it to praise the speech. Really harsh, (inaudible) called the Trump un-American speech and Fox News contributor Tamara Holder likened it to a speech by Hitler in 1931. He should...POWERS: Yeah, well, whenever you bring Hitler up you're kind of lost argument. But I do think that -- I think it's appropriate for people who are opinion people to say the kinds of things that a lot of reporters were saying. I did feel that some of the reporters were getting a little too -- it was a little biased. I think that you need to do the best that you can to try to, like Tucker said, analyze it on the face of it instead of sort of casting it in this really uniformly.I mean, everybody kind of said the same thing, and it was just sort of interesting that everybody was saying exactly what all the liberal commentators thought of his speech. Personally, I agreed with them but I do think that there's another perspective on it and there are a lot of people in the country who do feel that what he was describing is true. I'm not one of them, but there are a lot of people certainly in our halls who agree with them.KURTS: James?ROSEN: I think Trump delivered a very tough speech and I think that's what he intended to do. And I think there is -- throughout this campaign, we're seeing it more and more now especially with the influence of some consultants in his corner, a distinct effort to try to conjure Richard Nixon 1968. I am the law and order candidate. I am appealing to the silent majority and but...KURTZ: If that presses a red button for journalists who thinks of Richard Nixon as 1973 Watergate scandal breaking the law.ROSEN: Sure. I mean, look, almost whatever Trump said and did on that stage, on that night, was going to be criticized by the preponderance of the media which skews left. I would say that it was a missed opportunity for Trump in one respect and similar to the missed opportunity that for Ted Cruz at the convention, which is there is a place in these appearances for humor. Humor can go a long way. I happen to think if Ted Cruz had said I was reminiscing with my dad about his role in the Kennedy assassination...KURTZ:  He didn't do it at all.ROSEN: We were looking at the family album, the National Enquirer. He could have done a lot of good for himself and I think Trump should have used some of his more trademark humor in that speech.KURTZ: The media's shorthand on this, I think it was midnight in America, play on the old Ronald Reagan (ph) and is it going to go on until midnight because it was a lengthy speech. Since you mentioned Ted Cruz, what an enormous explosion of coverage when he gave that fiery speech, got booed off the stage, didn't endorse Donald Trump, said vote your conscience. Here is just a brief taste with some of the commentators have to say.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC: What was really out of line tonight I think politically and historically was for Ted Cruz to basically snub the candidate for president.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, last night, what Cruz delivered was the longest suicide note in American political history.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Ted Cruz got what he wanted here, seeing (ph) which was a lot of coverings and the next morning he had a press conference and all the cable news network took it live. So, from his point of view, he ceased the spotlight.POWERS: Yeah, but I think there's always something dangerous in trying to get the short term payoff and I think he thinks that he was doing a long- term payoff, but I don't think he's going to get a long-term payoff. I think he got a short term payoff and I hope he enjoyed it as long as it lasted.KURTZ: And actually some of the Trump people loved it. I mean, usually they say, oh, you're making too much of this and that, you win (ph) in the media, like yeah! Keep covering it, because they thought the speech, the booing and everything cast Trump almost in a sympathetic light for allowing Cruz to speak even though he was kind of like the guest at the dinner party and he drinks all the wine and then...CARLSON: He still overshadowed Trump's son and running mate.KURTZ: What?!CARLSON: I don't think viewers at home understand -- when you watch all the different networks and everyone's saying exactly the same thing, the reason is they're all on Twitter. You sit and go to visit a set. Every anchor is on Twitter, every commentator is on Twitter, except Charles (inaudible) -- no, no. Everybody else, and that's why they all sound the same.KURTZ: Are you suggesting a certain group think?CARLSON: It's exacerbated by social media. My number would -- if I were giving advice to a young person who wanted to be a pundit, I would say stop and refuse the evident (ph). People insist they want to do it. Don't go on social media because you sound like a robot. You sound like every other dumb person on cable (ph).KURTZ: Well...ROSEN: The advice I would give is to first of all make your parents send you to pundit camp early on, and then do inter-pundit internships during college years.CARLSON: I would say become an HVAC repairman.KURTZ: Before we steer us on the wrong direction, the (inaudible) special view (ph). So, they were a lot of stories in advance of the Cleveland convention. Politico had GOP operatives dredged from the convention, the New York Times said GOP officials brace for chaos in Cleveland.Did that set a certain narrative which then when the convention actually happened and there were things that went wrong, there were mistakes and mishaps in timing, there was the minority trying to get a vote to change the rules, which they shouted (ph) down, did that narrative, would it become a self-fulfilling prophecy in sight (ph)?ROSEN: Look, this was a very contentious primary season and so it was natural to expect that it would be a very contentious convention. One has to say they put this whole thing together in about four weeks. It's never been done in anything under five and they did a fairly good job and it came off very well in most respects.But I do think that there was some dread and we did see it play out on that floor fight (ph) which was extraordinary. I was told as a reporter you will never cover an exciting convention in your life and guess what? We had one.KURTZ: Yeah. The media sometimes forget that Trump ran against the Republican establishment, that's why many members still don't like him. We saw that in Cleveland. Back in Philadelphia in a couple of moments. You can e-mail us, mediabuzz@foxnews.com or @howardkurtz on Twitter. Hillary Clinton and her new running mate, what kind of coverage is Tim Kaine getting from the press?  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Donald Trump drew largely negative coverage for the roll out of his V.P. pick Mike Pence. Here's how the media are covering Hillary Clinton's choice yesterday of Tim Kaine.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TIM KAINE, PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Hillary Clinton is the direct opposite of Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)ANDREA MITCHELL, NBC NEWS: The pick was absolutely as far as the Clinton campaign is concerned a home run.DAN HENNINGER, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Tim Kaine just knocked it out of the park in front of a progressive audience.HUGH HEWITT, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: You couldn't get closer to Goldman Sachs if you were building furniture than Tim Kaine.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Hugh Hewitt didn't like the choice. Kirsten Powers, the press really love Elizabeth Warren, but I seemed to get excited about Tim Kaine, who's you know, very experienced senator, former governor of Virginia, but not exactly exciting, in fact he pleads guilty to being boring.POWERS: Well, he does but I think that's part of it, you know, sort of under promising and then he ends up coming out and doing this really great speech and I think really did impress a lot of particularly progressives, but I think even people in the media. So, we have very low expectations and you come out and you do something that's more than what people were expecting. I think you end up getting really good coverage.KURTZ: I happen to think that both Tim Kaine and Mike Pence are serious and solid choices...POWERS: Yes.KURTZ: ...for their running mates, but it seemed like the coverage of Mike Pence focused much more on finding differences between him and Donald Trump, and the craziness of the whole veepstakes process. So do you see a difference in tone or do you think...CARLSON: Well, Mike Pence is the evangelical and there's nothing more repulsive and terrifying in our world than an evangelical, that's the first thing...KURTZ: Why, because the press doesn't like evangelicals?CARLSON: They hate them. But this race has been framed (inaudible) getting by Republicans initially who hated Trump as a moral contest. It's not just we disagree. It's you're evil and I'm virtuous. That tone has been adopted by the press. If you read ""the Washington Post,"" my hometown paper, six stories in a row yesterday in top news stories attacking Trump. They have taken on as their moral mission to destroy this guy and prevent him from becoming president. They go on to a force (ph), a lot of them. I mean that.KURTZ: Well, what struck me also was the relentless and hyperactive coverage of Trump's selection process, which went through a lot of twists and turns. It was Newt, it was going to be Christie, no it's Pence and always having second thought about that. Tim Kaine was always seen as Hillary Clinton's top choice, that didn't change, it didn't leak, just sent it out by text and then he gave a pretty good speech.ROSEN: No, it did leak. I mean, and that's why he was seen as the top choice. That's how you knew that.KURTZ: All we want s by choice.ROSEN: OK, but look, I think...KURTZ: There were no dramas.ROSEN: The media are invested in the V.P. pick as a quadrennial exercise that is lucrative and fun, but we all in the back of our minds know that it is not dispositive toward electoral success in any way. So, that's the kind of dishonesty that we all engage in like...KURTZ: Who's it going to be?ROSEN: By the way, it doesn't matter.KURTZ: But who is it going to be?ROSEN: And so, we play these games. I just want to say to you that when you have Tim Kaine and Mike Pence, the sizzle there, I wonder if Las Vegas would even be willing to take bets on who'll win that debate because it will be such a snooze fest it will make Cheney/Lieberman look like the Ultimate Fighting Champion event.KURTZ: We'll have you provide the color commentator James Rosen.ROSEN: You got it.KURTZ: All right, now -- but if you wanted to focus, do an investigative reporting, it's not hard to find out that as governor and lieutenant governor, Tim Kaine accepted $160,000 in gifts, perfectly legal but, you know, lots of money for a Caribbean vacation and clothing.You could also focus on the fact that because the press loves to write about abortion and Republicans, that while he supports pro choice policies. He says, he's personally as a Catholic opposed to abortion, and yet, I see little of that or it's played down. Also, he's against the death penalty.POWERS: Well, because I actually don't think Democrats care if you're Pro Life as long as you don't actually want to stop abortion.KURTZ: And is the press the same way? Could that say (ph) safe...(CROSSTALK)POWERS: I mean, well, the press is supposed to cover what -- I mean, it's not about what they think about it. It's supposed to be, is this an issue for the people are going to be voting for? Or is there hypocrisy there because the Democrats, you know, don't like pro-life people. But the truth is, if you support Roe v. Wade, then you're not going to do anything to challenge Roe v. Wade. People leave you alone. That's just the way it works.KURTZ: But Kaine also -- Kaine also had...POWERS: I mean -- I mean, you know, Harry Reid is Pro Life, I mean... KURTZ: Kaine also had supported free trade as is Hillary Clinton. Now, he slipped and he's against the Trans-Pacific Partnership. What I'm saying is if we wanted to make an issue out of these things, there's plenty of stuff to dig there.CARLSON: Right. Nobody in the press knows what the Trans-Pacific Partnership is, so that's why it's too complicated.KURTZ: Tucker you're taking the fun out of it.CARLSON: As for abortion...(CROSSTALK)CARLSON: You can say whatever you want, if you have 100 percent rating from (inaudible) the abortion lobby -- you're for abortion. If I work for Harrah's, I can't say I'm anti-gambling, can't I?KURTZ: No. All right, and on that note, Tucker Carlson, Kirsten Powers, James Rosen, thanks very much for joining us here in Philadelphia. Coming up, we take a look at the other big story this week. It involves Fox News and change at the top of this company, and my report on Roger Aelis' resignation in a moment.   (COMMERCIAL BREK)KURTZ: Fox News is drawing an enormous amount of media attention for an abrupt change at the top of this network. Enormous because Roger Ailes, who resigned this week as chairman of FNC and Fox Business Network has been such a high profile figure in politics and in television.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)LESTER HOLT, NBC NEWS: Now official, Roger Ailes, a giant figure behind the scenes in television and the GOP has been ousted.SCOTT PELLEY, CBS NEWS: Today, the man who created conservative-leaning Fox News two decades ago was forced out over allegations of sexual harassment.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: Rupert Murdoch is taking over as chairman of FNC and Fox Business and assuming the role of acting CEO. Ailes will be available for now as a consultant to Murdoch. Now, the announcement by the network's current company, 21st Century Fox, fought a sexual harassment suit filed this month by Gretchen Carlson after her contract as a daytime Fox host was not renewed.Ailes has strongly denied the allegations in that suit. 21st Century Fox hired a law firm to conduct an internal inquiry and that was followed by leaks to the press. I can confirm reports that a number of female Fox employees who were interviewed for the internal review made allegations of inappropriate conduct.Megyn Kelly, who was also cooperating with the inquiry, has not discussed reports that she alleged improper conduct taking place about a decade ago. Ailes has denied her allegations saying, ""He spent much of the last ten years helping her achieve the stardom she earned."" Meanwhile, Murdoch placed Ailes in a statement for having made ""a remarkable contribution to our company and our country.""There are also words of praise for Ailes from Murdoch's sons, James and Lachland Murdoch, top executives at 21st Century Fox and widely reported to have been at odds with Ailes. Without directly referring to the harassment inquiry, they said that, ""We continue our commitment to maintaining a work environment based on trust and respect."" Many, many observers were struck by how quickly Ailes' departure was arranged.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARGARET SULLIVAN, WASHINGTON POST: It is surprising in some ways because some of these allegations have been around for a very long time, some of them for decades or you know, many decades. So, the fact that it all came together within two weeks is rather stunning.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Some high profile anchors at Fox defended Ailes in an interview saying they could not imagine him engaging in inappropriate conduct. Fox News contributor Kirsten Powers told the New York Times, ""I was disappointed that so many senior members of Fox's on-air team rushed to defend Roger in a way that seemed to prejudge an investigation into sexual harassment."" Nearly everyone regardless of their views agreed that Ailes' impact was hard to overstate.(BEGINN VIDEO CLIPS)STEVE HAYES, WEEKLY STANDARD: I mean, when people talk about ""the conservative media,"" when you think about the media environment that we live in, particularly political media, it is largely the creation in some ways of Roger Ailes.JIM RUTENBERG, THE NEW YORK TIMES: The Fox News has been such a part of our dialogue and that's the Fox News that Roger Ailes created. Without Roger Ailes, Fox News changes, and I think our political dialogue changes somewhat.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: That remains to be seen. Murdoch has left Ailes' top executive team in place. Still, let me be blunt: This has been a painful and embarrassing period for the network but the news operation of the 76-year-old Ailes built remains in place.Coming up next, they were with me in Cleveland. They're here in Philadelphia, Bill Hemmer and Martha McCallum, on a tale of two conventions in a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: To continue our look ahead of the Hillary Clinton convention here in Philadelphia and the coverage of Donald Trump's convention after our week in Cleveland. Joining me now are Bill Hemmer and Martha MacCallum, the anchors of ""America's Newsroom."" They're over in our sky box looking very cool.So, we spent a week together in Ohio and here we are in Pennsylvania. It's no secret Bill Hemmer that Donald Trump and his convention got very critical scrutiny from the media, but how much of the Hillary and the Democrats up until now seems to lack the same intensity? Your thoughts?BILL HEMMER, FOX NEWS: I think that will change, Howie, but I do believe this, as long as we're in the prediction business.MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS:  Right.HEMMER: There will be half an eye on this convention hall for the next four days and will be half an eye on Donald Trump. You don't know what he will do in terms of communication or appearances or tweets. He's very unpredictable, and just like we saw at the tail end of the Ted Cruz speech in Cleveland, Ohio, his appearance inside the arena took the carpet right underneath of Ted Cruz.What will he do? That's one thing that you need to watch. The other thing are the protesters. This place blew up 16 years ago when the Republicans came here for their convention and they will be out in force much more significant than we saw in Cleveland, Ohio. And my third hunch is that by Wednesday all this matter about Bernie Sanders will be behind the DNC and Hillary Clinton.MACCALLUM: Yeah, I think you're right about that.(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: When you look at the sort of -- go ahead -- sorry, Howie, we got a little bit of a delay and we're just getting the kinks out here. I think we just sat down on this set brand new just a few minutes. But basically I think you're going to see the Democratic National Committee try to sort of shift to a lighter more optimistic tone here. They're definitely hinging upon the idea and the theme that it was a very dark convention for the RNC and that they're going to try to be lighter and more optimistic.But they also going to have to play that off of Hillary Clinton's record, and really the true state of how things are in the world right now -- even the president chimed in and said, you know, it was a dark convention and that it portrayed sort of dangerous world, and what we found in Cleveland is that a lot of people do feel that they live in a dangerous world, so they're going to try to counter balance that message here in Philadelphia.KURTZ: But Martha, pick up for a second on Bill's point about we're likely to have almost a split screen experience this week with Donald Trump still making news while the Democrats gather here in Philadelphia. During the Cleveland convention, there really wasn't much Hillary.She came back into the news obviously on Saturday with her pick of Tim Kaine. What does that tell us about the news business? Doesn't Donald Trump frankly still drive ratings and clicks even when it's not his week to have a convention?MACCALLUM: Yes. It's kind of one of the benefits of going first in a way because you've already laid down your markers and set your theme. So, they're going to try to reinforce that theme over and over. The RNC has been sending out, you know, e-mail last week. It was interesting because the DNC was sending out a lot of stuff.In one point they sent out a list of the speakers for the RNC and then they had everything crossed off except, you know, some of the people that we've saw to sort of send the message that they hadn't been successful in lining up the speakers that they wanted to at the RNC.So, there's always that awful effort that's going on, but at least Donald Trump sort of already has his in the bag and he can react to what's going on here in Philadelphia, and no doubt he'll do that -- he did this morning with his tweets and social media that we always see from him.KURTZ: And Bill, what about the story that's really kind of starting to bubble up this weekend about this 20,000 hacked DNC e-mails including some embarrassing and trash talking -- embarrassing comments and trash talking about Bernie Sanders leading to the point that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the party chair is now not going to speak at her own Democratic convention. Is that going to scramble the storyline for the press compared to what we all thought it would be 48 hours ago?HEMMER: I don't think there's an aggression (ph). It will Howie and I don't think it's good at all for DNC. I don't think it's good at all for Debbie Wassermann Schultz. Bernie Sanders has been breathing down her neck for months right now, you know, he wants her out. I'm not suggesting she will be out, but we understand she won't be speaking.There were some reports already this morning that the position she has to preside over this convention will no longer last. If that's the case, just like the Republicans perhaps had a few distractions on Monday and a few more on Tuesday, I would expect the same for the DNC. This will not start smoothly. We know that already, Howie.KURTZ: And Martha, the way in which the press largely covered Donald Trump's speech -- dark, some called him a demagogue, a lot of fear, there weren't a lot of light moments. Does it seem to you that journalists and some pundits talk about Donald Trump differently than any other presidential candidate in the past? Obviously there are many differences including his outsider status.MACCALLUM: Well, I think they do. I mean, I think in a way he opens himself up to that because of the nature of his tweets and how brash he is in his talks. The fact that the whole country sort of already knows him in that reality TV show since from ""The Apprentice"" and all of that, but yeah, the gloves have been off for a long time between the press and Donald Trump and it does feel as if there's -- that it's okay, you know, to jump on him.It's okay to put him in a framework that, you know, is definitely more sort of belligerent in an open way by many in the press. So, it's a challenge, you know, to cover all of this in a very fair way, and to listen to what each candidate is saying, and to hold them accountable for what they're promising in these speeches and kind of let that bigger picture fall to the wayside and stick to the facts of what each party is presenting. And you know, when I was driving in here there's a big billboard that said, ""Hillary We Have Your Back,"" you know, love the media, as if it was a post- it note to her as she came in to Philadelphia.KURTZ: Probably from the RNC.MACCALLUM: Yeas, exactly.HEMMER: I would just add to that, Howie, I think the RNC -- I think Republican voters care a lot about that. I don't think Donald Trump cares about it. You know, when he sent his tweet out last week talking about Melania's speech, and he said, ""If you believe all press is good press,"" and I think that's what he lives by. As long as people are talking about him, he feels that he's winning the day.KURTZ: That tweet nailed it and naturally you two did as well. I should mention that you'll be anchoring a two-hour coverage from Philadelphia at the top of the hour, and since you've been so nice to me, I might wander over there and join you. Bill and Martha, thanks.HEMMER: Please do.MACCALLUM: We look forward to it. Thanks, Howie.HEMMER: See you Howie.KURTZ: All right, one of the biggest stories in Cleveland was Melania Trump and the whole plagiarism controversy. Did we overplay that? Back in a moment from Philly.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: We're back from Philly. The media reviews for the Melania Trump speech were very good until hours later when journalists playing over and over again passages that seemed plagiarized from the current First Lady's convention address eight years ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA: Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values.MELANIA TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S WIFE: From my young age my parents impressed on me the values.OBAMA: You work hard for what you want in life.M. TRUMP: That you work hard for what you want in life.M. OBAMA: That your word is your bond, that you do what you say you're going to do.M. TRUMP: That your work is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise.(END VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: But in a series of TV interviews, campaign chairman Paul Manafort refused to admit that the words and phrases you just saw had been taken from Michelle Obama's speech fueling a media uproar.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)CHRIS CUOMO, CNN: What happens when you're running the government of the United States and you don't want to deal with what happens then?PAUL MANAFORT, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Well, Chris, I guess it's all in the eye of the beholder because the pattern that I see is a pattern of the media not being prepared to look at what's really going on in America, look at what's really happening in the Trump campaign.CUOMO: I can't move on because you keep lying about it so I can't move on from it because I have to talk about what is true.MANAFORT: Chris, I'm not lying about anything.CUOMO: Did the language -- did a portion of the language of that speech come from Michelle Obama's speech? Yes or no?MANAFORT: As far as we're concerned there are similar words that were used.JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC: They are making the candidate's wife take the fall, even leaking to the New York Times that this was Melania.(END OF VIDEO CLIPS)KURTZ: Finally a Trump speechwriter said she had mistakenly added the quotes after Melania read her some passages she liked from Michelle Obama's speech over the phone. And Donald Trump declined the staffers offer to resign. Joining us now herein Philadelphia, Lisa Boothe, columnist for The Washington Examiner and a Republican strategist and Julie Roginsky, a Democratic strategist and Fox News contributor. Lisa, Chris Cuomo wouldn't move on CNN but Paul Manafort wouldn't acknowledge the obvious and how much of that fuel the story?LISA BOOTHE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Well, I don't think they sounded anything like, just kidding. No, I'm joking.JULIE ROGINSKY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: ...about to fall off his chair.KURTZ: Let's check your talking points here.(CROSSTLK)BOOTHE: No, I mean, OK. Look, clearly there are similarities there, and they should have just admitted it and moved on especially considering the fact they eventually did admit it. Plus the coverage was obsessive and you go back to 1987, Joe Biden had to drop out of a presidential race because of a plagiarism scandal. You go back to 2008 and President Obama lifted things from Governor Duvall's speeches as well. So I mean, look, this kind of stuff happens in campaigns. I think...KURTZ: From Governor Deval Patrick?BOOTHE: Yes. And you know what, I think it would be a lot more impactful if it was Donald Trump himself as opposed to the candidate's wife, but the coverage was excessive and sort of on the borderline ridiculous in my opinion.KURTZ: Well, you may want to push back on that and maybe you know, my view was that it was a small to medium deal. It wasn't huge. What made it huge - - what made the story go on for three days was that the campaign (inaudible) it just didn't happened. It's so it's like, oh, well, let's play the tape again and again.ROGINSKY: No question, but this is the problem, the reason you have this obsessed media coverage and you're so right about that is because the campaign mishandled it tremendously. If you make a mistake especially with the press, the first rule of any good campaign is don't lie to the press because the press has, you know, you could be ink by the barrel now. We got 24 hours a day of cable news television to fill. People are going to talk about it. What they should have done is admitted there was a mistake, fired whoever they needed to fire to have scalp (ph) and just moved on.And then we would have moved on, everybody would have moved on. But by extending the story, of her saying Melania had written it herself, which I thought was a huge disservice to her, and then by saying well, there are no similarities. Well, of course there were similarities and then continuing to go on and on for a few days and only then having some woman who worked for the Trump organization not the campaign come out and say, yeah, by the way I'm the one that's responsible for this. It became a three or four-day story where it really should have been a one-day story.KURTZ: We'll we're going to move on. My verdict is the media probably overreacted but the campaign made sure this did not go away until Wednesday of last week. All right, so it's no secret the convention in Cleveland was largely panned by the mainstream media as being too dark, as being disorganized, the Ted Cruz problem. Was this an honest assessment of a bumpy convention or do you think there was a fair degree of anti-Trump bias?BOOTHE: Well look, I mean, I was watching other networks and also reading a lot of this -- the headlines and all of it was negative. There really wasn't a whole lot of positive news that stemmed from it. And what's ironic too was CNN actually had a poll from viewers that said 75 percent of viewers view Donald Trump's speech in a positive manner but that certainly wasn't the coverage that they drove. So now I do think...KURTZ: Well, more Republicans may have watched the speech than Democrats when you do that kind of poll.BOOTHE: Well, I mean, I don't know. How do you think the poll would be relatively objective if those were done in real time after the speech? But I mean, I'd certainly wouldn't -- see the perception that you would get watching other networks and or reading various newspapers.KURTZ: (Inaudible) the media verdict was the speech was so, you know, on the verge of a disaster, but on the other hand there's been polling since that shows that maybe he's flipped up a few points, you know, it's ephemeral. But it certainly didn't seem to hurt him.Contrast to whatever you saw as the Cleveland coverage, with the coverage that we here in Philadelphia leading up to the Hillary Clinton convention, because up until these leaked e-mails, I was not really saying the same intense level of media interest in this democratic convention.ROGINSKY: No, because I think Hillary Clinton is a cautious candidate and she's not a show woman. And Donald Trump, whatever you might think of him puts on a good show. We all went to Cleveland, all of us who were there. I think all three of us were -- went there knowing that whatever was going to happen it was going to be new breed. This is candidate that puts on the greatest show on Earth. He's P.T. Barnum.BOOTHE: He's not.KURTZ: So you're saying boring candidate, borin convention and the media will...(CROSSTALK)BOOTHE: Can I just point out a couple of things that are a little bit ridiculous?(CROSSTALK)BOOTHE: But you0`ve got the media that obviously drove this narrative of disunity in the Republican Party. You have the own DNC chairwoman that is not going have a presence at the convention this week because of the WikiLeaks document. Also, you have Michael Brown's mother, a man who was shown to have robbed a bank and reached for an officer's gun speaking this week and I have not seen any coverage on that. That should be ridiculous.ROGINSKY: I've seen this timeless coverage of Debbie Wasserman Schultz.BOOTHE: Published (ph) survey.ROGINSKY: No, no, from a...(CROSSTALK)BOOTHE: I thought you were mentioning the other.ROGINSKY: No question, I mean, there is tons of coverage on Debbie Wassermann Schultz in every network, in every newspaper, everything I've seen today.KURTZ: So you're thinking in 20 seconds, do you think that that is going to change the coloration of what might have been a scripted, boring convention and the media coverage will be looking for signs of disunity as they were in Cleveland?ROGINSKY: If Bernie Sanders has any signs of disunity, which I don't expect him to have, but if he pulls a Ted Cruz, it's going to be covered the way it was covered in Cleveland. Obviously, I don't see that he's doing that. But look, (inaudible) they took it away from Debbie Wassermann Schultz, they put this to rest. They should have done this with Melania and they didn't, and that's what's going on.KURTZ: It's called damage control.ROGINSKY: Exactly right.KURTZ: All right, Lisa Boothe and Julie Roginsky, thanks very much.BOOTHE: Thank you, Howie.KURTZ: And when we come back, we talk to somebody who's been at a work at a number of conventions. Joe Trippi, coming up her in Philly in just a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: If it seems a little damp in here, we're essentially in a giant air- conditioning pen here in Philadelphia and it's pretty hot under the lights. You know what we need now? We need a Democratic strategist who's, been through many of these conventions. Joining us now is Joe Trippi, Fox News contributor and former campaign manager for Howard Dean and a lot of other people in your party.So, true or false, the media love conflict, they love excitement, they love when people are butting heads and they're going off script. So, the Democratic Convention compared to the Republican Convention in Cleveland is going to be a relative snooze for the press.JOE TRIPPI, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: True about that's what the press loves. And I'm not sure, I think Monday night is a show -- I think we have a little conflict. I think there will be -- I think differently than the Republican Convention, the Democrats will try to get it all out of the way in one day.KURTZ: Get their fighting out of the way?TRIPPI: If there's going to be a rules vote or something like that, if you're going to put Cruz on, you put him on Monday, not on -- so Bernie will speak on Monday. I don't expect to have the same kind of conflicts that happened at the Republican Convention in Cleveland, but if it happened, we're going to try to get them all out of the way on Monday, and then try to turn...KURTZ: Except that Hillary Clinton and the Democrats have this nice choreographed convention plan. And along comes WikiLeaks, and I hate hacked e-mails, but you know, 20,000 e-mails are out there, and the disparaging things that Wasserman Schultz and others working for her said about Sanders, kind of proving Bernie's complaint that they were tiling to Hillary Clinton, and now as a result, Debbie Wassermann Schultz is not going to speak at her own party's convention so, detecting media temperature index going up as far as what's going to happen here in Philly.TRIPPI: Well, appropriately said. I mean, Bernie people who are out -- I mean it's not Bernie himself but a lot of his supporters, his delegates were furious already and this enflames it. The one thing I would say, look, if the party operatives weren't out to get you, you wouldn't be an insurgent and I've experienced that myself in the Dean campaign that I ran --KURTZ: Dean was a democrat, but he was an outsider.TRIPPI: Yeah, but we were announcing (ph)...KURTZ: But how about this. When Hillary Clinton picks Tim Kaine, I would say that got very restrained coverage, very positive coverage. But compared to the GOP, I mean, you didn't go through this whole like, is it going to be Kaine or Tom Vilsack. It all just kind of rolled out nothing like the Trump frenzy, why?TRIPPI: Well, I think two things. One is they had pretty much telegraphed it was going to be Kaine for a long time.KURTZ: You think that was deliberate?TRIPPI: Yeah, I think so.KURTZ: Draining the drama out of it?TRIPPPI: And, you know, to soften the blow to any Sanders, to some of the pull back they got from progressives (ph) but also, again, they're better at choreographing these things. I mean they, you know, they didn't change their strategy, they went through with the -- they went with the text message to announce him and then showing up in Miami the next day.KURTZ: Here, Senator Kaine is more favorable toward banking industry than is Hillary Clinton. He had been for free trade, he's now modified his position. He's personally opposed to abortion, although he follows the Pro- Choice position. So, why not media focus on the differences between the two of them, which is what we saw when the press picked on Mike Pence and what he had said there was an opposition to Donald Trump.TRIPPI: Well, I think -- it seems like the press is going easy on Kaine. Well, one, I think Kaine really is respected on both sides. I mean you can't -- it is like this Jeff Flake's -- Senator Flake said, you couldn't come up with something bad to say about him. So, I do think there are differences. And look, I think the other part of this is its not unusual for vice presidents and presidential nominees to have to fix their different views for the first, you know, wrap (ph) or so.KURTZ: Right. So, this is a more typical rollout, where everything about the Trump campaign is sort of exciting all opposed to...TRIPPI: Also, look, I was really interested on who Trump was going to pick or what he was going to do? That's part of what he creates, for the media is this, you know, this whole question of what's he going to do now.KURTZ: Even Joe Trippi is breathlessly following Donald Trump. All right, Joe Trippi, thanks very much for stopping by. Some final thoughts from here in Philadelphia, when we come back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: When it comes to covering conventions, stuff happens. And the media love the stuff, the unscripted stuff, as we rather dramatically saw in Cleveland. Sometimes we make too much of these facts and missteps creating an endless loop.Sometimes campaign mistakes such as the Trump folks refusing to admit the plagiarism involving Melania's speech, keeps the story alive. Sometimes a moment is so dramatic, Ted Cruz sticking it to Trump and getting booed big- time.But the narrative is irresistible, but it drowns out other important moments like Mike Pence's speech as the V.P. nominee. What concern me going into Cleveland, where all the media stories predicting chaos and journalist accustomed to the drama surrounding Trump may have played that up because it's good for ratings perhaps, because, well, it's Trump.Will they apply the same standards to Hillary's convention here, especially now that those leaked DNC e-mails have re-opened old wounds between the Hillary and Bernie forces?We'll be carefully watching the media coverage and so, I bet, will you.

5	5	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/05/21/is-sanders-better-bet-for-democrats-against-trump/	Is Sanders the better bet for Democrats against Trump?	"This is a rush transcript from ""Journal: Editorial Report,"" May 21, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.PAUL GIGOT, FOX NEWS HOST:  This week on the ""Journal: Editorial Report,"" panic on the left as Bernie Sanders vows to push on to California, then to the convention.  So why can't Hillary Clinton close the deal?Plus, she's promising to put Bill in charge of kick-starting the economy, but it's not her husband's Democratic Party anymore.And, Donald Trump tees up his list of Supreme Court nominees as the remaining eight justices weigh in on Obama's birth control mandate.But first, these headlines.(FOX NEWS REPORT)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT., DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I should tell you that there are a lot of people out there, many of the pundits and politicians, they say Bernie Sanders should drop out.(BOOING)SANDERS:  Let me be as clear as I can be.  I agree with you.  We are in until the last ballot is past.(CHEERING)(END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT:  Welcome to the ""Journal: Editorial Report."" I'm Paul Gigot.A defiant Bernie Sanders vowing to say in the Democratic presidential race until the bitter end, despite a growing chorus on the left urging him to pack it in.  A new Fox News poll is the latest to show Sanders running stronger against Donald Trump in a general election matchup than Hillary Clinton.  So could he be the better bet for Democrats come November?  Let's ask Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; editorial board member, Dorothy Rabinowitz; and ""Best of the Web Today"" columnist, James Taranto.  So, James, the Democratic establishment, including all of the columnists who love his Socialist ideas, are now turning on Bernie Sanders.  Why are they falling out of love?  JAMES TARANTO, BEST OF THE WEB TODAY COLUMNIST:  Well, I think Sanders is reminding them of the party's real problem, which is Mrs. Clinton.  They don't really want to think about how difficult it's going to be to run with her as their candidate in the fall, and Sanders is reminding them of her weakness.  She was supposed to have a coronation.  He was supposed to be a minor protest candidate.  The reason that he's done as well as he has is because of Hillary Clinton.  GIGOT:  They want him to get out so that -- right away she can focus on Trump.  TARANTO:  Right.  And so that they don't have to worry about her as much for at least a couple months.  GIGOT:  So, Dorothy, what about the argument that Sanders people are making that somehow he's being treated unfairly, that he's not getting the love that he deserves because of how well he's done.  DOROTHY RABINOWITZ, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  Well, Sanders people are filled with Bernie-ingested martyrdom.  They all walk around perceiving a world full of ""the system is rigged.""  This is the fuel on which --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  But is it fair?  Is it a fair point?  RABINOWITZ:  No, it's not fair.  This is an election contest.  But this is exactly what happens when you're imbued with revolutionary ardor.  Bernie Sanders is not terribly different from Donald Trump in this one regard with his followers that they will question nothing and he will question none of their behavior, as you can see.  GIGOT:  He has won, Dorothy three of the last four major states.  And the one he lost, Kentucky, was very close.  Is this a case of Democrats having some buyer's remorse at the end of the campaign about Hillary Clinton, even though she's likely to be the nominee?  RABINOWITZ:  I don't think so.  I really don't.  This is the standard. People hang on to the bitter end.  I don't see a great difference here. The intense dislike of Hillary Clinton has fed into this story that he's the real victor, going to be, but obviously she has the nomination as she keeps saying, and as she keeps being censored for saying and noticing.  GIGOT:  But the polls, Dan, show that Sanders does better against Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton does.  Could he be the better general election candidate?  DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR:  I think he could.  Those head to heads that have had Sanders beating Trump by double digits have been there for months, Paul.  They've always been sitting there without much comment at all.  I think that -- I think what it represents is a generic candidate, Democratic candidate, against Trump.  Hillary is the one that barely beats him.  If that candidate were Joe Biden or John Kerry, I think in a head to head, they also would be 10 percent ahead of Trump.  GIGOT:  I would even suggest that maybe Hillary Clinton is the only Democrat who could lose to Donald Trump.  How does Hillary Clinton get Bernie Sanders and especially his supporters onboard, James?  TARANTO:  That's a very good question.  I agree with Dorothy that Sanders is not being cheated out of the nomination.  I think that's a ridiculous claim.  However, if his supporters feel that he's being cheated out of the nomination that's a political problem for the Democrats anyway.  GIGOT:  Right.TARANTO:  Our colleague, Peggy Noonan, proposes in our paper this weekend that Mrs. Clinton should consider making Sanders her running mate to keep the party together and bring his supporters onboard.  (CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  A 70-year-old ticket to try to drive the --(CROSSTALK)TARANTO:  Yeah, 144 years between them.  (LAUGHTER)I first thought that was a ridiculous idea.  But reading Peggy's column, I kind of felt like the logic was surprisingly compelling.  GIGOT:  I know you don't agree with that.  (LAUGHTER)RABINOWITZ:  Wait until the American people get a full, steady blast of Bernie Sanders, a man of the left, to put it mildly, for whom the entire American system has been poisoned his entire life, and there's no concealing it.  This is what is there in Bernie Sanders.  When you listen to him, why are you bothering me about the violence of my followers fighting for a better world?  (LAUGHTER)It's the 1960s all over.  We're bombing campuses.  (CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  So you don't think Sanders would help Hillary Clinton?  RABINOWITZ:  I think he would be an endless battle.  GIGOT:  So How does she get his supporters?  A speaking spot at the convention?  Sure, you'll give him a big spot on the platform.  He has already influenced her agenda in a major way on trade, taxes and health care, so many things.  How else does she mobilize those voters to keep them so they come out instead of staying home?  HENNINGER:  She could go up in front of cameras and say I'm a socialist.  (LAUGHTER)Really.  This is the problem --GIGOT:  That's not going to help.  (CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  For the swing vote, that's not going to help.HENNINGER:  That's exactly right.  That's why all these pundits are upset about Bernie because he's moved the party so far to the left, he's locking Hillary in to progressive positions that will make it impossible to pivot towards the center in the general election.  GIGOT:  Very quickly.  TARANTO:  She's moved to the left.  One thing he has that she doesn't have, even if she declares herself a socialist, is sincerity.  (LAUGHTER)GIGOT:  OK.RABINOWITZ:  Sincerely, yes.GIGOT:  Still ahead, Hillary Clinton promising to bring in Bill to shake up the sluggish economy.  But it's not her husband's Democratic party anymore. A look at Hill-onomics versus Bill-onomics, when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE & FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: My husband, who I'm going to put in charge of revitalizing the economy, because he knows how to do it and --(CHEERING)CLINTON:  -- especially in places like coal country and inner cities and other parts of our country that have really been left out.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GIGOT:  Two for the price of one.  That was Hillary Clinton in Kentucky last weekend promising to put her husband in charge of kick-starting the economy.  But it's not Bill Clinton's Democratic Party anymore.  We're back with Dan Henninger, Wall Street Journal columnist, Mary Anastasia O'Grady; and editorial board member, Joe Rago.  So, Dan, putting Dollar Bill in charge of the economy.  Smart move?  HENNINGER:  We saw the revision.  She says now he's going to be in charge of inner cities and coal country, so it's mission impossible for Bill.(LAUGHTER)  GIGOT:  What's been happening the last seven years?  HENNINGER:  Yeah, well, I think it was an expression of panic on her part. She thought that she needed more than what was working for her.  The big thing to look at here is her unfavorables.  Her untrustworthy polling numbers are at 55.  They're actually rising towards 60.  So she needed something and she thought she was bringing in the Democratic Party's most popular Democrat, but keep in mind, this is a guy they call Slick Willie. So if your untrustworthy numbers are high, how does this help?  GIGOT:  Well, she's saying -- she's trying to generate -- she's going to say, forget the last seven years, OK, now that she's pivoting to the general election.  Let's go back to the '90s, because, Mary, those were years of good, solid growth.  We can do it again, put Clintons in charge.  MARY ANASTASIA O'GRADY, COLUMNIST:  She's not only saying forget the last seven years, she's saying forget the last five months.  (LAUGHTER)She's been really far to the left, competing with Bernie Sanders, banging the drum about inequality, saying she's going to soak the rich.  And now she's looking ahead to the general and she's thinking, OK, I have to move to the center a little bit, and Bill Clinton, because he oversaw a strong economy, after, I remind you, after the Republicans won the House in 1996 --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  1994.  O'GRADY:  Sorry, in 1994.  She feels like that's a safe cover for her so that she can get to the center.  GIGOT:  The policies -- Mary's point is the policies are so different from what Hillary Clinton is proposing now versus what Bill Clinton pursued in the 1990s.  Give us some examples, Joe.  JOE RAGO, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  Right.  The point is that the Obama-era Democratic Party has repudiated the Clinton-era centrist economic agenda. If you look at trade, for example, Bill Clinton finalized NAFTA.  He put China into the World Trade Organization.  Now you have Hillary running against the Pacific trade deal that she helped negotiate as secretary of state.  If you look at taxes, Bill Clinton cut the capital gains tax rate. Hillary Clinton is proposing the largest increase in American history.   There's really a contradiction there between rhetoric and reality.  O'GRADY:  Yeah.  And her narrative is that wages are low and people are struggling because the rich are too rich.GIGOT:  Right.O'GRADY:  That's her narrative.  That's not what Bill Clinton used to manage the economy in the '90s.  GIGOT:  I would go even further than -- I mean, Joe mentioned two most prominent ones.  But you've got entitlements.  Bill Clinton talked about reforming them.  Hillary Clinton wants to expand them.  You have welfare reform and labor policy.  Bill Clinton wanted to have work requirements and welfare to get more people onto the ladder of opportunity.  Hillary Clinton wants to expand all of these mandates and government assistance.  She doesn't want to reform welfare.  HENNINGER:  She doesn't want to reform welfare and she doesn't want to reform the regulatory state.  I mean, He did that.  She wants to expand Dodd/Frank and extend it to nonbanks.  She is in another one of these dilemmas where she cannot separate herself explicitly from Barack Obama, but she is trying always to signal people in the center that I am not going to continue the policies of the past.  GIGOT:  OK, so you would think, Mary, that it's an advantage to Donald Trump on the economy, and some of the polls show that.  How does Hillary Clinton fight back on the economy?  I guess, go after the rich?  O'GRADY:  Well, yeah, that's what she thinks will work.  And I don't think that's necessarily a bad strategy just because there's a wave of populism here, right, that we believe that marginal tax rates matter.GIGOT:  Right.O'GRADY:  That if you tax the rich, they don't do as much as they normally would to stimulate the economy.  But I think she's counting on the idea that there's this populist wave and that she's going to tell these people, who have had very depressed wages during the Obama years, that she's going to make them better off this way.  GIGOT:  Joe, is the economy an advantage for Trump as an issue?  RAGO:  It should be an advantage.  Is he going to have the wit to point out some of the contradictions we've been talking about?  He's not a policy guy.  It's really incumbent on him to learn his briefing book and be able to point out some of these differences between what she's saying and what she'll do as president.  GIGOT:  Any chances of that happening, Joe?  RAGO:  Who knows?  (LAUGHTER)GIGOT:  When we come back, a big week for Supreme Court watchers with a narrow win for the Little Sisters of the Poor over Obamacare's birth control mandate.  And a list of potential nominees from Donald Trump.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT:  The Supreme Court once again taking center stage in the 2016 campaign as likely Republican nominee, Donald Trump, releases a list of 11 potential nominees, and the remaining eight justices issue a decision in one of the most closely watched cases of the term.  We're back with Dan Henninger, James Taranto and Joe Rago.  So, Joe, the Little Sisters of the Poor case, a religious liberty case, a lot of people are saying this is a victory actually for the Little Sisters. You agree?  RAGO:  I do.  I don't think it's a narrow victory.  I think it's a pretty broad victory decided on narrow grounds.  What they were saying was, we want some kind of accommodation that actually accommodates our religious beliefs.  GIGOT:  So we don't have to follow the mandate on contraception and abortion as part of Obamacare law.  RAGO:  That's right.  And what the Supreme Court did was they said, after oral arguments, go back, is there a way to accommodate them and still achieve all the goals of this mandate, and the Obama administration admitted, yes, there was.  So what the court said was, all right, go back, figure out some kind of compromise that respects the tradition of religious pluralism in America and we will see if it happens.  GIGOT:  They vacated the lower court judgments against the Little Sisters of the Poor and said, you cannot in this decision punish the Little Sisters in the interim while this is being negotiated.  But the lower courts could come back if the Obama administration, James, does not agree to the accommodation that Joe suggests and rule against them and go against them again.  TARANTO:  Well, the big question is who replaces Justice Scalia.  If it's a Democratic appointee, either Merrick Garland or an appointee of Mrs. Clinton, then the case probably eventually works its way out and a majority of the court says the government can force the Little Sisters of the Poor to violate their religion conscience.  GIGOT:  What chance do you think, Joe, is there that the administration will actually accommodate the Little Sisters?  RAGO:  There's a modest chance --(LAUGHTER)-- that they might do so.  This is really about militant cultural liberalism.  It's about coercion, forcing private institutions to accommodate the state, basically.  So they have been given a chance for a do-over.  We'll see if they take the invitation.  GIGOT:  James, what do you think of the court, how it's doing generally in the 4-4 split?  TARANTO:  It's very interesting the way it's been handling it.  The way they handled the Little Sisters case, basically ordering the parties of the case to work it out themselves, is something I haven't seen them do before.  There have been a couple cases where they issued one-sentence orders saying the decision of the lower court is upheld by a divided court.  That means they make no new law and the appeals court makes the decision.  So another thing I think we might see them do is issue very narrow unanimous decisions that just restate current law.  GIGOT:  All right, Dan, let's turn to Donald Trump's nominees, 11 names out there.  What do you think of them and was this a smart move?  HENNINGER:  It was a smart move.  Most people think they, by and large, are impressive, conservative jurists.  There's not too much dissent from that. The question is whether he would follow through on it.  He has a credibility problem.  I think, Paul, it would be very difficult for him, as president, to flip and just appoint a crony, because he's doing this to get the support of the conservative movement.  We are talking about a lot of voters.  If Trump were president and went back on this, his approval rating would drop to 40 percent within a month of his presidency.  GIGOT:  But here's the thing.HENNINGER:  Nobody would want to do that.  GIGOT:  But here's the thing.  We still have a campaign.  The reason most nominees don't float these names beforehand is they can become targets. You are already seeing the left say, ah ha, this decision on abortion, this decision on religious liberty, this decision on contraception, and targeting those --(CROSSTALK)HENNINGER:  All reasons conservatives would support these people.  The left is making the case for us.  GIGOT:  So the advantage is to Trump to say, see, they are attacking my nominees, conservatives come on board.  Is that --(CROSSTALK)TARANTO:  That's exactly right.  The liberals are helping Trump solidify the conservative base, which is a problem for him because conservatives don't trust him.  GIGOT:  So you like the idea as well that he floated these names?  What do you think of them?  TARANTO:  Well, I had not heard of most of the names, and I follow this stuff very closely.  But I will give you an example.  I got an e-mail yesterday from a reader from Colorado who has been very skeptical of Trump. He said, if there's any chance that Allison Eid could end up on the Supreme Court, I'll hang a long sign.(LAUGHTER)Allison Eid is a justice on the Colorado Supreme Court.  So here's a conservative in a swing state who is warming to Trump as a result of it.  GIGOT:  There are a couple names, Joe, that were left off that I would like to have seen them on, Brent Cavanaugh of the D.C. circuit, Jeff Sutton, of the 6th circuit.  They are both very high-powered intellects of the kind that the court lost, conservative intellects, with Antonin Scalia.  So that's too bad.  You like the list?  RAGO:  Luckily, Trump says he may expand it if he needs to.  I think this was kind of born of necessity.  Supreme Court politics are so intense, Trump needed to convince Republicans that he would fight on behalf of principles that he's shown he maybe doesn't care all that much about.  GIGOT:  Do you agree with Dan that this boxes him in somewhat?  He would pay a political price if he went off this list?  RAGO:  Yeah, I think if he tries to appoint his butler or a relative or whatever, I think this makes it much harder.  He will face a lot more resistance.  GIGOT:  All right.  Thank you all.  We have to take one more break.  When we come back, ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)GIGOT:  Time now for our ""Hits and Misses"" of the week.  Mary?O'GRADY:  Paul, this is a miss for the Obama administration, which this week demonstrated its incurable ignorance about economics with a new wage regulation that doubles the salary level below which employees have to be paid overtime after 40 hours of work.  This demonstrates that President Obama thinks the only thing necessary to raise wages is that he can simply wave his arm and mandate it.  I'm predicting that companies will, in fact, make other adjustments so that their compensation costs don't go up.  GIGOT:  I think a fair bet.  Dorothy?  RABINOWITZ:  Paul, this is a hit to HBO's magnificent production of ""All the Way"" about LJB's successful passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Bill in a time of enormous rancor between left and right, conservative and Democrat. Yet, they crossed the aisle, left and right, and produced this move for justice.  It would be nice to think that our political parties could one day have that character.  GIGOT:  All right.  Dan?  HENNINGER:  A future miss to Google, which held a big presentation on artificial intelligence products this week, products that do your thinking for you.  One of the examples cited was, so if someone sends a photo of a grandchild to a grandparent, your cell phone will automatically reply, ""Man, she's really cute.  Thanks.""  You don't have to do anything.  (LAUGHTER)HENNINGER:  This is --(CROSSTALK)GIGOT:  Do you like that, Dan?  HENNINGER:  I like that.  Some day, I will be able to go, ""Siri, what should I think of Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominees?""  (LAUGHTER)""They're all beautiful.""  (LAUGHTER)GIGOT:  All right.And remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us at JER on FNC.  That's it for this week's show.  Thanks to my panel and to all of you for watching.  I'm Paul Gigot.  Hope to see you right here next week.  ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

6	6	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/05/28/who-more-serious-candidate-clinton-or-fiorina/	Who's the more serious candidate: Clinton or Fiorina?	"This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" May 28, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle along with Juan Williams, Eric Bolling, Dana Perino and Tom Shillue. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""Two women running for president may dual appearances in South Carolina yesterday. Which one is the more serious candidate? Here was Carly Fiorina.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARLY FIORINA, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think when 82 percent of the American people now believe that there is a professional political class, more interested in preserving its own power and privilege than it is this serving the American people, people expect basic questions to be asked of anyone running for president. What have you done? Are you trustworthy? Are you transparent? Will you answer questions?(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: And here was Hillary. Notice her new accent.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Right here in South Carolina. I just came from Kiki's Chicken and Waffles, which I highly recommend.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Oh, I may like the chicken and waffles, not the accent. Fiorina pointed out serious issues about Clinton's record.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FIORINA: But a secretary of state, she took women's right and human rights off the table for discussion with China. She called Bashar al-Assad a positive reformer. She said that Iraq was a free stable sovereign nation. She said that she could reset our Russia -- our relationship with Russia. I think all of those things I just named go fundamentally to what is her track record.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Hillary pointed out her hair color.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Now, let me tell you, I'm aware I may not be the youngest candidate in this race, but I have one big advantage. I've been coloring my hair for years.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You're not gonna see me turn white in the White House.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: OK. Good job qualification, Dana? I mean, the accent --DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: It was kind of funny. I think it favors well with the crowd. The accent -- if you go back to 2008, remember all those clips depended on where she went in the country, she would adapt to that accent. President Obama is the same. A lot of candidates do that. It is -- (inaudible) and I think to see that way -- the dyed hair comment, pretty funny, right? I mean for the crowd, they went crazy for it. So she can maybe made fun it for it. Talk about Carly Fiorina for a second, I love the gumption and the PR tactic to figure out a way, the she wants to get her name ID up. She took the argument to Hillary Clinton's campaign and even draws out NBC's Andrea Mitchell to ask her questions because she's willing to answer questions from the media. I thought that was really, really smart.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. I mean it looks like, Eric, she's come into play. She's like, listen, take me seriously. I'm a credible candidate. I will not shy away from questions.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Hillary you mean.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, right -- Carly.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Passionate, focused.BOLLING: Right. Well, she has to.GUILFOYLE: And she just went right in the Hillary's house. It was like, check me out.BOLLING: Yeah, and she has to, and she did a really fine job doing it. Now that's something we've been talking about for a long time, who was, who was it gonna be. Do you want more of the same policies and Hillary would probably bring a lot of the same things that the Democrats and President Obama has brought? Or do you want someone who's actually led something? Carly Fiorina led a group, led an organization, a global organization. You like that. I'm not saying she has a chance. She's a great -- I love what she says. Look at what Hillary is doing, though. She finally gets and she starts talking and she gets in front of people and what is she talk about? She talks about hair color. She talks about the chicken and the waffles. She's brilliant. She's winning. She has scandal upon scandal, upon scandal, it's not affecting her polling, she still beating everyone including Rand Paul, who gives her the highest --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: But why are you contributing brilliance to her? --BOLLING: No, because she's just --GUILFOYLE: I just think she's just sort of like --BOLLING: It's brilliant campaign.GUILFOYLE: The lucky C-club, the lucky Clinton club.BOLLING: K.G., if you're winning, if you're winning -- football, you're winning. You're up by 30 points and there is only five minutes left. You're not going to take chances and throw the ball in the end zone. Run the ball, get a first down, don't take any chances, she's playing prevent -- she's playing prevent offense and it's working.TOM SHILLUE, GUEST CO-HOST: That's her slogan. Hillary, take a knee.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Wait, look. No, no. How is this? Hillary is winning. I'm right? Look, if she starts to falter, then you'll gonna see her starting looking to the end zone, looking for the wide receiver, trying to --GUILFOYLE: Looking for the Hail Mary pass. We can do this all day, Bolling. I go started (ph) with you --PERINO: Do you think she wants it for a safety?(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: I think she's winning and aiming smart politics.GUILFOYLE: How many points is that, Dana?PERINO: Two.SHILLUE: I'm gonna defend her on the (inaudible) --GUILFOYLE: The intelligence on this show.SHILLUE: I do that. When I travel around the country, I can't help it. You know, you go into a waffle house, you know, yeah, I just love -- I just love what you're doing here. Can I get some grapes you know? I go home to Boston one day, I'm like, everybody stop talking, I got to park my car. I mean it's like --GUILFOYLE: Because you're a comedian --SHILLUE: I know, but --GUILFOYLE: And an actor.SHILLUE: It work slip with. That's it. I think as a performer, I go around and try to relate to audiences. So it does slip in.PERINO: There are all kind of -- yeah, that's what I'm saying, they're kind a performance.SHILLUE: They're the same, yes.GUILFOYLE: OK. But do you want a president that trying to earn a SAG card or be commander in chief, right? Because you can put on your little resume, it was like a dialect. Southern, southern charm, business warm, greets on the side. I mean, come on.SHILLUE: People love it, though, right?GUILFOYLE: Let's talk about some real qualifications to people.SHILLUE: Isn't that what works in politics, though we know it's -- who people relate to.GUILFOYLE: I get it.SHILLUE: It's like a thing of who want a beer with. I mean, you can't change people's minds. That's the way they think, right?GUILFOYLE: I'm offered --JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Can we talk politics for just a second?GUILFOYLE: Yeah, let's do it. Yeah.WILLIAMS: Because I think there is something really interesting going on here in two levels. One is --GUILFOYLE: What is?WILLIAMS: Carly Fiorina wants to get on the Fox Debate stage, Guilfoyle.GUILFOYLE: She does. She wants to get her numbers up, she was --WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: To play with the big boys and she deserves --WILLIAMS: Right.GUILFOYLE: A spot there, I think.WILLIAMS: Well, I -- you know because she'd be the only woman. I think it's so important for the Republicans to do --GUILFOYLE: No, not because she's the only woman.WILLIAMS: Oh, I think it is. I think that it's important for the party --PERINO: What? You can't say that.GUILFOYLE: That is just -- that is just really -- its (inaudible).PERINO: That's not the only reason to have her at the debate.GUILFOYLE: I would want to be on the stage, its gratuitous (ph).PERINO: Because she's like earned her spot at the debate.GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: Yes. But I think that for the Republican Party to show --PERINO: I don't know.WILLIAMS: That there is a woman in the mix is a good thing for the party. And much away, and you gonna, you can smack me down again, but I think it's good to have Ben Carson, a person of color up there again representing a different --GUILFOYLE: Whoa, whoa, whoa.WILLIAMS: For the Republican Party.GUILFOYLE: Flag on the play.WILLIAMS: OK.GUILFOYLE: This is not affirmative action policy.WILLIAMS: I didn't say it was. I don't --GUILFOYLE: Because the president of the United States of America.WILLIAMS: Fine. What do you -- you know I throw it back at you. So you think only white men deserve to be on the stage for the Republican Party?PERINO: I can't believe you're saying a white woman on the democratic stage.GUILFOYLE: I think it's you --WILLIAMS: All right. No, no --PERINO: I can't believe that's how you --WILLIAMS: That's one person. Anyway, my larger point is that there was a poll today that showed -- there were five Republicans, right now, tied for the lead, right? So you imagine those five on the stage, right Kimberly? So who are the other five? Right now sixth is Paul, seven is Cruz, eight is your friend, Mr. Trump, nine is Christie from New Jersey, and then it's a tie between John Kasich, the governor of Ohio and Carly Fiorina. So she needs to do things done by following Hillary and start mocking Hillary.GUILFOYLE: Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something about Carly Fiorina. She wouldn't want to be on the stage because they said let's check the gender box.WILLIAMS: Oh, gosh.GUILFOYLE: She wants to be on the stage because she earned it and she got the numbers and she qualified to be in the game.WILLIAMS: What she got earned it?GUILFOYLE: I don't want them to just put me on, even if I thought I was better than all those guys, I would - whoops and you know what, I would say, let me get out there, let me get in front of people. I would for sure go to all of Hillary's events that she wasn't taking questions. It's like kind of the equivalent of a photo bomb in politics and go there. And like you said, try and draw out somebody like Andrea Mitchell and engaged. Get the dialogues going and I bet you it will resonate.PERINO: And she was very smart. When the debate rules were announced, instead of complaining like, well, this isn't fair --GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: And you really need to have a woman up there, she said, ""I look forward to working hard and seeing you on the stage."" That's why she -- that's how --GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: Yeah.PERINO: Somebody who actually has her heart in it and wants to win because she thinks she's the best person for the job.GUILFOYLE: And by the way, she's acting like --WILLIAMS: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: Bolling, how would like her? You're a pro ballplayer. Why - would you like to say, hey, Bolling, we'll give you a spot, you know --WILLIAMS: No. You misinterpret this.GUILFOYLE: On the team because you're representing -- you know, Chicago?BOLLING: So -- no, you wouldn't want it. And I'm thinking -- I'm pretty sure the RNC would never put Carly Fiorina or Ben Carson up because he was black and she was a female, if they didn't deserve it.WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: If Fox says 10 people, it's gonna be the top 10 --WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: That's gonna probably be the way they will go with it. I do think people are voting for the first female president.PERINO: Yeah.BOLLING: I think there are a lot that are -- maybe in the middle who are not necessarily Republican or Democrat who say I want to see my -- the first female.GUILFOYLE: Yup.BOLLING: As they did the first black president. I can't wait for a day when we're done with all firsts and we finally get back to let's --GUILFOYLE: Qualifications.BOLLING: Let's have the best president for the United States.GUILFOYLE: That's what I'm saying.WILLIAMS: You know --GUILFOYLE: So when you said brilliant, that's why I was taking issue with it because I think what is -- so brilliant about what Hillary has done except this --BOLLING: When you're winning.GUILFOYLE: You zip it.BOLLING: When you -- when you don't take chances, right? You don't --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Well, I understand that. What so, was sometimes you say don't run up the score, right? And for it's like you're winning. You sit on it, you take a knee. You don't go ahead and throw the ball recklessly down field -- whatever. Unless, you got somebody amazing as like we see.PERINO: Right.GUILFOYLE: Like we had in 49ers Dwight Clark. But other than that, I hear what you're saying.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Well --GUILFOYLE: I know because you were --BOLLING: (inaudible)GUILFOYLE: You were saying -- OK. Well, he is not very well behave, so I'm not gonna say now.BOLLING: Jerry Rice.GUILFOYLE: Jerry Rice, I like him.WILLIAMS: Let's talk about --GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: Republican women for a second. Because right now you've got in the Senate, Joni Ernst, right? And I think Joni Ernst had a veteran -- he really, I think he's coming on as a strong presence for Republican women in this country. You've got Susana Martinez down in New Mexico. I think you got people -- I'm thinking of Nikki Haley in South Carolina.PERINO: Because anything gonna mention by Hillary Clinton yesterday, as the first Republican woman --WILLIAMS: Yes.PERINO: To win in South Carolina. Hillary goes there, it's just like for like one magnanimous gestures wants to be able to say, right here in South Carolina, it's proven a woman can win. And she was the first governor. Like - there was like, there's no willingness to engage at all --BOLLING: That, that would have been actually good idea for --PERINO: It's like smart.GUILFOYLE: It would have been brilliant.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Then could you could call her brilliant.PERINO: It's not in her nature to do it. It wasn't like --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: It wasn't a national idea.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: It's a hard ball politics, you know.BOLLING: That's the risk.WILLIAMS: Because I know --SHILLUE: They don't come --GUILFOYLE: Well, it is --WILLIAMS: What?GUILFOYLE: It's --SHILLUE: They don't --GUILFOYLE: They compliment across the partisan line.SHILLUE: Republican women, they don't count to Democrats. They don't count as real women.PERINO: That's right.SHILLUE: Because they --PERINO: It's the last thing you're allowed to be in America.SHILLUE: Yes. And that's why I can't -- I think Carly Fiorina is going to rise in the polls and she probably will be in that debate because she's the best communicator out of all the Republicans.PERINO: Yes.SHILLUE: The best.BOLLING: So which one is the --PERINO: She's relentlessly on message.BOLLING: What's wrong with (inaudible)GUILFOYLE: Yes. She's --BOLLING: I mean, you're talking about some --SHILLUE: She looks --PERINO: Whoever it is.SHILLUE: I know.GUILFOYLE: Who cares, it's about that. It's about who doesn't make the numbers.BOLLING: You lose, do you lose Kasich? Do you lose --WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: Carson --WILLIAMS: I don't know.BOLLING: That's -- tall order.SHILLUE: You know what the problem is? The Nexus Press is the problem.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. But Bolling --SHILLUE: Carly Fiorina can't get in the news, unless she attacks Hillary. When she talks about anything else, they ignore her.WILLIAMS: Oh, no. See, I think, I disagree. Why -- she never talks about the other Republicans and she better start talking about those other Republicans. That's who she's running against right now.PERINO: No, I disagree. I think --GUILFOYLE: I disagree with him too.PERINO: That right now, her strategy -- Carly strategy -- I agree Hillary's strategy is winning for her. Carly Fiorina's strategy to focus on her is smart because Republicans with at large are looking at a field of possibly 20 candidates. What they really want is somebody who can win. OK? So they want someone who is willing to throw a punch.GUILFOYLE: Open up the (inaudible).PERINO: You know what Carly Fiorina now -- she actually is willing to do it. She'll take it right to the fight, so the right into the middle of it.BOLLING: Can she, can she proceed if she doesn't make that top 10? And hit the --PERINO: Maybe. I don't think that's the end all be all. I don't -- I really don't think that --WILLIAMS: Well, not for her because she can --PERINO: If you don't --WILLIAMS: She can sell finances because she's rich.PERINO: It doesn't matter, like if any, if of them don't make that top 10 - -GUILFOYLE: It's not that.PERINO: It doesn't mean their candidates --WILLIAMS: Well, I think it's tough, Dana.PERINO: Candidacies are over. It's tougher --WILLIAMS: It's toughing.PERINO: But it's not over.WILLIAMS: No. But let's just say this, she does. You guys are talking about Hillary one liners, I think she's had some very good one liners coming to the point of she's a good communicator. Her line about Hillary -- you know all that travel as secretary of state, that's not an accomplishment, that's not to be right, and then her one liner about men being impacted by their hormones as even in the oval office. I think these are memorable lines for Carly Fiorina.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: Oh, you like that Tom.GUILFOYLE: Well, you like her. So listen --SHILLUE: Yes. I was impacted by hormones.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: I like her energy and her enthusiasm. To me, she is showing and I think she really wants to be president of the United States and she wants people to like, wake up, take notice. She wants to be in the game. I love that kind of enthusiasm.PERINO: It's an interesting thing, though, about the media. So -- you guys see that New Yorker cover from earlier this week? So the New Yorker does illustrated covers, they have all these different guys running for president on the cover and it's -- in a locker room, and it's all -- you know, the usual suspects, people you might see on the top five. But Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina don't even get -- they don't even get drawn in, it's not even like a little pencil sketch in the back. And I think that it will be hard for her to be able to make a presence -- her presence known unless she does things like she did yesterday. I thought that was very smart. And I know she has very good people surrounding her.GUILFOYLE: Well, guess what? We're talking about her right now in the A- block of the show and the point is what she's doing is she's making some good political noise with some facts and specifics to back it up. So I think her strategy is brilliant.BOLLING: Can I just add something in that --(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: And Hillary has been low key and she's -- like, you know slow balling it, run the ball. But Saturday, Martin O'Malley is gonna announce. So maybe she starts hitting some of the issues a little bit harder, some of the important issues. Who's maybe --PERINO: I doubt it.BOLLING: But maybe -- if it -- remember, you do all these polls and his -- and Hillary is beating Rand Paul. Hillary is beating Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, if you put -- if you introduce Martin O'Malley in the mix, does that skew the -- you know all of a sudden do Republicans start giving her --WILLIAMS: You know what is interesting about that poll?BOLLING: Just the step the game of.WILLIAMS: You know I was curious about this. In fact, the number two now on the democratic side is Bernie Sanders.BOLLING: But it's only that one.PERINO: Well, that's the only other one.WILLIAMS: No, no, they put everybody in there. So it was Bernie Sanders and then Vice President Biden. O'Malley didn't even really register.BOLLING: It was next week.WILLIAMS: Do you think so?BOLLING: Yeah. I think Saturday is gonna be interesting.WILLIAMS: Let me add this. You know who Martin O'Malley was before we started?GUILFOYLE: I did.BOLLING: I did. But I did --PERINO: That was a weird to it now --GUILFOYLE: I did.BOLLING: But I also like what he is.WILLIAMS: What?BOLLING: I actually like Martin O'Malley.WILLIAMS: OK --BOLLING: I do. I -- I just think he's (inaudible). He has that likability factor --GUILFOYLE: And he's got some good ideas.BOLLING: You pointed out.GUILFOYLE: He's actually been well liked by Democrats for a long time.PERINO: I would, I would think -- I'm so surprised by that. You can't possibly like his economic policies in Maryland.BOLLING: No. no, his likability.SHILLUE: Yeah.BOLLING: His personal likeability.SHILLUE: For someone who doesn't know about politics, they look at the guy and they're gonna think he's kind -- and he seems like a guy's guy.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: But he does know about politics.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: And he's a rock and roller, Tom.(CROSSTALK)SHILLUE: Yeah. He's a rock roller.WILLIAMS: He's a rock and roller. You bet.GUILFOYLE: Best part of Hillary's comment was that shout out for Kiki's, right? Waffles?SHILLUE: Oh, yes.GUILFOYLE: Chickens.WILLIAMS: Chicken and waffles.GUILFOYLE: I want, I want to go there.SHILLUE: I think I've been there.GUILFOYLE: All right, coming up, the soccer shocker. Eric has the latest on the FIFA corruption scandal including reaction to the arrest from Vladimir Putin. Guess what, he isn't happy with America, next on The Five.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Shame and humiliation as fallen on world cup soccer. The United States Department of Justice has charged nine FIFA officials with 47 counts of racketeering, fraud, bribery and money laundering of up to $150 million. That's huge. Sepp Blatter, the president of FIFA earlier today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEPP BLATTER, FIFA PRESIDENT: Many people hold me ultimately responsible toward the actions and reputation of the global football community. I cannot monitor everyone all of the time. We will cooperate with all the authorities to make sure anyone involved in wrongdoing from top to bottom is discovered and punished.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Well, he's not falling on sword after all he's up for re-election tomorrow. And this happened today, too. Vladimir Putin declared the U.S. to be, quote, ""meddling in FIFA business"" well that's rich considering Russia is hosting the world cup in 2018. But what's got me up at night is this. Now granting (ph), good for the DOJ for taking down the Clinton's involve with FIFA but, isn't it time for our justice department to look into what some might call, similar accusations of bribery and greed levied against the Clinton Foundation? Now I'll go to Juan, my liberal and my soccer fan.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Some of the same types of accusations --WILLIAMS: Well, in fact, two, two leads --BOLLING: Influence --WILLIAMS: Yeah, in fact --BOLLING: And bribery.WILLIAMS: But from FIFA to the Clinton Foundation --BOLLING: As well.WILLIAMS: And from people who are getting contributions. You know, making contributions are the same people that were selling bribes to FIFA in order to get --BOLLING: Qatar.WILLIAMS: Yeah, Qatar in specific, in order to get the world cup. I think Qatar gets it in 2022 right after the Russians.BOLLING: Who and it's about 110 degrees in the shade in Qatar in August when they are playing soccer. When it's not --WILLIAMS: When (inaudible) are not.BOLLING: Crazy, right?WILLIAMS: Unless you're getting paid, they make some kind of crazy. Who would pay soccer in the crazy heat? I don't.BOLLING: He gave us a lot of facts now, the question was, should the DOJ open an investigation into the Clinton Foundation, given the --WILLIAMS: Well, you got to find -- you got to have proof of something illegal. That's the hang-up there. I mean, it's like saying the FBI, O'Reilly says, ""Send the FBI in."" FBI says if you give us something that -- actually, you can't just go picking around and say, I don't like these people, they're political.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: OK, legal or illegal?GUILFOYLE: I don't know.BOLLING: Do we need something --GUILFOYLE: Here we go. Here we go again, Juan. Here we go. The problem is - - you just, he wants proof. That you always want like the body with the knife this it or like the gun in the hand with like the full confession, all the package, you don't get -- you don't have that. But you have to do is do an investigation. Do an investigation to find conclusive proof, and then you present it in the case and then you let them decide. You don't just sit there and go -- give me all of it, like Clinton. Come in right now. Listen to me, (inaudible). I know you do a (inaudible) --WILLIAMS: I don't --GUILFOYLE: You're not going to do it.WILLIAMS: Like (inaudible) --BOLLING: So --GUILFOYLE: They will do a southern accent and say, hey (inaudible).BOLLING: So, Dana. Is it strange to you that the DOJ is investigating -- FIFA is I believe in Zurich, it's that where they domicile. In Zurich, they will open up this big investigation, four year investigation, I understand, yet Clinton some of the same accusations, nothing with the Clinton Foundation, as far as we know.PERINO: Well -- or the other is that, let's just say -- there could be at the justice department right now, there could an investigation that is under way. And it's quiet and it's sealed. And we won't know until she's in the White House.BOLLING: Right.PERINO: That they actually had an investigation open. So that it is possible and it's a fair point. I do think it's interesting that the first thing that Putin did was come out and defend Blatter, and -- you know this is -- it's such a political situation. The other thing I'm glad about, that I hope this does is --GUILFOYLE: Hope it does.PERINO: Palestinians were attempting to get Israel kicked out of the world cup. I hope that these will hopefully, to slow that train down and get it off -- maybe even get it off the tracks completely.BOLLING: Tommy, Qatar has never qualified for a world cup tournament, yet they will gonna host it in '22.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: Russia, as Dana point out, in 2018, they're gonna host the World Cup. Remember what happened in Sochi Olympics? Remember the disaster there?GUILFOYLE: Remember the toilets?BOLLING: The toilets -- the yellow water, the cockroaches.SHILLUE: Well I remember --GUILFOYLE: No toilet paper.SHILLUE: The rumor was Clinton was so angry that, we didn't get the world cup that he --PERINO: Yeah.SHILLUE: Threw a glass or something happened.PERINO: Yeah. She broke a mirror.SHILLUE: Yeah, and that's when -- that's right. He punched a mirror or something like that. That was the rumor. But -- are we surprised that FIFA has some connection to the Clinton Foundation? We should start with a list of people who haven't given money to the Clinton Foundation. It's only like four people so far. But --(LAUGHTER)PERINO: I'm in.GUILFOYLE: They're at this table. Yeah.SHILLUE: I've mean, he's got Blatter. He's gonna get reelected.GUILFOYLE: Juan did.PERINO: Yes.SHILLUE: And he's the closest thing we have to a Bond villain. Have you seen, he's always -- we got to get him like --(CROSSTALK)SHILLUE: A nice Persian cat. Look at him, his --GUILFOYLE: Dr. Evil.SHILLUE: He is Dr. Evil.BOLLING: So shouldn't he step down, should he -- I mean, clearly he's gonna run tomorrow. I mean, he's --PERINO: I would (inaudible)BOLLING: At least nine officials who are -- or arrest public perp walk, handcuffs, we would allow it, didn't we?GUILFOYLE: I mean, I love it and I love his name, right. Like Sepp --WILLIAMS: Blatter.PERINO: What is like a disease? GUILFOYLE: It's like Septic Blatter.SHILLUE: Yeah. No I accept on matter for that, it clear, clear right up.(LAUGHTER)SHILLUE: But they, they didn't get to Sepp, though. They got his lieutenants, the vice president -- the guys just under him. So he's gonna come up (inaudible) free.PERINO: So what kind of bad things like, I have no idea what my organization is doing?SHILLUE: (inaudible) that's what they did in Enron. The top guy, they never, they never catch him but it's all --GUILFOYLE: You know -- you know you're really guilty when like Vladimir cat -- Vladimir Putin is like, vouching for you and he's your character witness. I mean, I would fall over laughing in the courtroom -- people call.WILLIAMS: You know, at just to --GUILFOYLE: Vladimir Putin.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: You know that the United States is the one that is doing this.BOLLING: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Because the Europeans are crazy for soccer, not us.PERINO: But that was I was actually --GUILFOYLE: No, we're getting (inaudible).PERINO: I was actually interested because -- you love this story and you knew it immediately that it was a huge story, but you hate soccer.BOLLING: I don't hate soccer. I prefer other sports. I can't watch a full soccer game.GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: I can watch any football game on the planet.PERINO: I have three members sitting here during the world cup and you hated it.BOLLING: Well because -- for 20 years at least --GUILFOYLE: I love it.BOLLING: You've been hearing the accusations of FIFA --WILLIAMS: Oh, yeah.BOLLING: Just giving --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: For 20 years, finally someone did it. The really interesting point of this whole thing is Europeans have said, good job, U.S.A, good job going after them. We've known it for a long time.WILLIAMS: Yeah because --BOLLING: Where are they, though?WILLIAMS: It's yeah -- and where are they and you know they've said, oh Blatter should step down"" and he said, oh, no I can't be there right now because we have an election tomorrow. How incredible. They are so weak and ineffectual, and that's the biggest for - I mean, imagine if this was the NFL?BOLLING: Yeah.WILLIAMS: I mean -- there would be riots in the streets.BOLLING: Yup. Would Goodell step down?WILLIAMS: No.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: All right. Up next, Baltimore is breaking records for violent crime after the Freddie Gray riots. How does the mayor explain the surge in violence? We will invite (ph) her, that's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: Now to Baltimore's crime crisis. It's he been the deadliest month for the city this century, 38 people have been murdered so far, the highest monthly total since 1996. Arrest to plummeted, since the rioting and crimes gotten so bad, some residents say, they are afraid to go outside. Noting police aren't patrolling like they used to before the Freddie Gray riots. Leland Vittert asked Baltimore's Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake about the spike in violence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LELAND VITERT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: How this is the deadliest month in 15 years. How is that anything other than a failure of your policies?STEPHANIE RAWLINGS-BLAKE, BALTIMORE MAYOR: There are a lot of reasons why that we -- that we're having a surge in violence and other cities have experienced police officers who have been accused or indicted for crimes. And there is a lot of distrust and, you know, the community breakdown. The result is routinely increased violence.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Does that mean the police are doing less? Arrests are down 50 percent.RAWLINGS-BLAKE: I'm not 100 percent sure what you're doing.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Craziness.WILLIAMS: Well, let me suggest that what he's doing is pointing out that, you know what? This murder thing is out of control, and it's black people killing black people. And it's mostly young black people, the very people involved in the riots. So I guess he's holding you to account. Eric, am I off?BOLLING: No, you're 100 percent right. And we've said it before. I've said it before. What did you expect was going to happen when you point the finger at law enforcement. Think of anything, think of a sports team. Think of a business, a position of military or law enforcement. Put them together.In a sports team, if the quarterback goes back and is about to throw the football, and he looks over and the coach is going ""no"" or ""stop"" every time, you're going to lose the game. In a business, if the boss says every time you think something, you're about to say something, and they say, don't say that, you're going to lose the ratings; you're going to lose the product.But in military and law enforcement, when the boss, the mayor, the police chief starts pointing the finger at the cops, you're going to -- you're going to question what you do. It's going to be demoralizing, and it's a matter of life and death.WILLIAMS: I think you and I disagree on this, because I think you can't have abusive police. Nobody is saying bad police is good and you're just making excuses and let it go away.BOLLING: Did I say that?WILLIAMS: No. But I just want to make that point. Because it's critical.But I do think at the same time, you know who needs police the most? The poor minority neighborhoods that otherwise become the wild, wild west. That's why you need police, and that's why you need confidence in the police.BOLLING: Or black police is what you need.WILLIAMS: Well, I think you need cops of any kind. But otherwise -- I mean, look, let me just say personally, who do you think is a bigger threat to me: the police in New York or Washington, D.C., or some kid who's doing a drive-by and stops in front of my house? Answer, B.SHILLUE: So why is it, Juan, a right-wing thing. Why is it that we have this kind of, like, the left in the country is always coming down on the police.And we have these demonstrations -- the demonstrators, we know that policy -- aggressive policing or, you know, the way that Rudy Giuliani, who was no friend of the black community, even though he was saving black lives because of his policies, right? Why is it that we can't have that logic?The idea that most of the protesters -- or maybe not -- that many of the protesters, they're alive because of the police. When you don't have aggressive police, people die.WILLIAMS: Well, again, you don't want to be a situation where you feel as if the police are an oppressive force in your community every time you show up just because you're black they know you're a bad guy. People don't like that.SHILLUE: So how did we get into that...GUILFOYLE: I think you mean proactive. You mean aggressive, like, working outside of their bounds. Like proactive...SHILLUE: Of course. I mean, aggressive to me is a good word. When I say it, I think I'm saying proactive policing. And that's what -- it never -- never rubbed off on Rudy Giuliani. The -- his relations with the inner- city communities got worse while there were fewer deaths. It always amazed me.WILLIAMS: Yes. Because people felt that they were being ignored and abused. I mean, it's just like stop and frisk here in New York. You could say stop and frisk has some positive impact, but it also means that if you're young and black in the city, you feel like every time a cop -- you see a cop he's going to harass you for no reason.GUILFOYLE: You want to be alive or do you want to have...WILLIAMS: No, you can't -- who wants to live in that kind of society?GUILFOYLE: But the point is it's legal. The United States of America, stop and frisk is legal. Just ask the Supreme Court. So this whole thing we're like worried about somebody's one part might be hurt feelings? There's always room for improvement, but don't take away the tools of what you enforcement otherwise you will see the aftermath and the result of these PC, foolish, reckless policies. And it's body bags now in Baltimore, thanks to that.WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know that it's all thanks to that.GUILFOYLE: Yes, it is.WILLIAMS: But I will say this: that you're right when you say that there's less aggressive, not abusive, but aggressive policing. What they're reporting is that, if a cop stops somebody now in Baltimore, a crowd gathers. They've got the video cameras out. The police feel absolutely like ""If I make a mistake, if I say the wrong thing, if I come upon the scene and somebody else is -- I'm going to get indicted here. So the police feel as if they are hand strung in simply try doing their jobs.About the line, now the cops are the ones with the cuffs on. They have the hands behind the back, they can't do the stop and frisk and then she just bucketed, you know, Mosby did, six cops. So do you think the rest of them want to put it on the line, lose their job, lose their family without any resources?Be like, ""I'm going to throttle back and sit this out a bit. I'll do what I need to, but I'm not going to get after it every day and go hunt it down. I'm going to respond if I need to, to calls.""WILLIAMS: What kind of language is that, ""hunt it down""? I don't know about that -- Dana.GUILFOYLE: Hunt it down as in go after it, try and go after leads. Do proactive policing, do the whole...WILLIAMS: No, we've got -- we should do...PERINO: I have a quick comment. That the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness actually requires structure, order and police. So when she is asked this question -- she's going to be asked more, if she does press conferences -- instead of saying, going back over cause and effect, which seems to not have any answer, I would recommend that they start focusing on ""Here's what we're doing about it."" OK. So rather than wallowing in that -- you know, she, when she ran, she said her goal was to get 10,000 more families to move into Baltimore. That is not going to happen.WILLIAMS: No, in fact they're talking about all the empty houses. Who -- let me ask you: Would you live there?BOLLING: And the exact same thing, that the people aren't moving in, moving out, same thing happened in Ferguson. The same. All these numbers, these crime rates, violent crime rates going up, where cops have said, ""Wow, you're going to point the finger at me for being proactive in my policing. Well, I've got to scale it back.""GUILFOYLE: That's what I just said. He's...WILLIAMS: All right. Unions helped fight for a minimum-wage hike in Los Angeles. But guess what? Now they're hoping they don't have to ante up. Ms. Perino explains when ""The Five"" returns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Last week, the Los Angeles City Council voted to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020. Union leaders helped lobby for the hike, throwing their full support behind it. But what's good for the goose is apparently not good for the gander.This week the unions are asking for an exemption. Rusty Hicks, head of the Federation of Labor in L.A. County, argues that companies with unionized workforces should have leeway to negotiate a wage lower than the one mandated.Eric, I want to ask you about this. This is like saying, ""Mr. Business Owner, I know that you don't want to unionize, but if you do, then you'll be exempt from this requirement and can pay your lowest skilled workers less; and we get more union members.""BOLLING: It's insane the hypocrisy of this. The unions, who paid people to protest to get their $15 wage law pushed -- pushed through city council in L.A., left a loophole in the -- whoever wrote the law left a loophole for unionized businesses to not have to abide by the union -- abide by the law that they pushed themselves.Only has -- this is exceeded by Obamacare. Remember that one?PERINO: Yes.BOLLING: Unions pushed -- SEIU paid people to protest. They made sure that Obamacare got pushed through. And then they asked -- union after union, there were hundreds of unions who asked for Obamacare waivers once the law was pushed through. Hypocrisy.PERINO: If it weren't so serious, it would be funny, right?SHILLUE: Yes. You know what? It is -- at first you look at it and you can't even believe it. But it is a crafty move by labor. Because they're saying, ""Hey, you know, you don't want to pay the $13"" -- what is it, $15?PERINO: Fifteen.SHILLUE: ""You don't want to pay the 15? Maybe we can make a deal."" So that's what they want to do. You don't have to...GUILFOYLE: That was an accent.SHILLUE: Exactly.WILLIAMS: He was doing a Hillary.SHILLUE: But they -- it's crafty, because they go to businesses and they say, ""We'll give you a break on the wage if you unionize, if you join us."" And then, once they're unionized, then they can -- you know, obviously, then they have a lot of power.But it's a great back door of getting unions in there. It's a good trick.PERINO: So cynical. They're telling these low-wage workers, ""We want to help you, so you pay us a fee to help you,"" and then they undercut the workers.GUILFOYLE: Yes. They're like, ""Do that. Come with us, and then we're going to have you get an exemption or exception, and you're going to work for less, but you're going to also pay us dues and it's going to be amazing."" Yes.WILLIAMS: Well, no. But it's totally self-serving and, you know, it just pains me to say, it's just totally hypocritical. I mean, and it's not just L.A. This is also true in Oakland. It's true in San Francisco. It's true in Chicago. I just don't understand how people can think we're just going to do this and no one's going to notice. Because it's an outrage. It's all about getting more union members.Now this extends, not so much in my mind to Obamacare but what's going on now with the whole deal about trade, the trade deal that President Obama is trying to do. The unions and the Democrats, they were opposed to it.When you look at it, you say, wait a second. This actually improves America's economic chances in the future. Overwhelming support from the American people, but somehow it's now politically required for Democrats to oppose it. I don't get it.BOLLING: But it's a tactic. It's a tactic to get unions, have more unions.PERINO: It's about more union memberships, not helping poor people.BOLLING: More union membership. It's a shakedown. It's a pure and simple shakedown of the businesses in L.A.GUILFOYLE: It's about reversing the decline of unions and their influence in this country. And they will do anything to still stay in the game and use people and make them work for less and promise them more. But it's just not true. There's no real good bargain there.WILLIAMS: But doesn't that undermine...GUILFOYLE: And by the way, the courts will overturn this, because the unions will be having an unfair advantage legally.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: But OK. So just for a second, just look at it from my perspective. Doesn't this undermine the authority, the credibility of unions when they do things that are just so patently hypocritical?BOLLING: Further undermine?GUILFOYLE: Correct.BOLLING: So why would they do that?PERINO: But it also, the other thing that it does is it gives unions a lot more money to play with so that they can get involved in elections.WILLIAMS: It worked.PERINO: And gives the Clintons cash.PERINO: ... Democrats. Voters, beware.OK. She spends her Saturday nights mocking a certain presidential candidate on ""SNL."" Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KATE MCKINNON, CAST MEMBER, NBC'S ""SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"": What a relatable laugh.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: But Kate McKinnon reveals her true feelings about Hillary Clinton ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SHILLUE: ""SNL's"" Kate McKinnon does a pretty spot-on impersonation of Hillary Clinton.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VANESSA BAYER, CAST MEMBER, NBC'S ""SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"": You're finally going to announce that you're running for president.MCKINNON: Oh, my gosh, I don't know if I have it in me. I'm scared. I'm kidding. Let's do this.BAYER: That's much better.Want to do some vocal warm-ups? And then we'll get started.MCKINNON: OK. Love to. Hillary is a granny with a twinkle in her eye. Hillary is a granny and she makes an apple pie. First female president. First female president. Mi-mi-mi mi-mi-mi-mi.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHILLUE: And it turns out she is a supporter, as well, and as a result, feels pressure to get the candidate's character just right.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MCKINNON: I do feel immense pressure. I'm rooting for her, obviously.I just wanted to play on the inherent contrast between a woman who is so driven and so hardened by her experiences and needs this; and the country needs this. And also a little sweetie granny from the Midwest.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHILLUE: ""Obviously, I'm a supporter."" Obviously. Kimberly, you were shaking your head. But shouldn't she be honest? We all know everyone over there at ""SNL"" is a Democrat, so why not they just come out and say it? Stop hiding.GUILFOYLE: I mean, it is so obvious. I hate when people are just like, ""Oh, well, you know."" It's like come on, we all know. Just, like, come out with it.But when I see stuff like this, I just feel like I'm going to have to get used to seeing a lot of it. A lot.SHILLUE: I say if we know how they feel...GUILFOYLE: No, I'm saying it looks like -- this whole thing seems like she's going to be president, doesn't it?SHILLUE: Well, I mean, exactly. They think it's a foregone conclusion. But they're all excited. I mean, that was a women's round table in comedy.Dana, why are women taking off in comedy? Is this the year of the woman comedian? We've got Amy Schumer, Amy Poehler, Tina Fey, Lena Dunham...PERINO: Finally getting their due.SHILLUE: They really are. They're taking -- what happened? White males, we used to run this thing.PERINO: You're going to need reverse affirmative action in the comedy world.SHILLUE: We do. I'm not kidding. It's like they're all...PERINO: It's just that it used to be -- I think that being professional and being coy and saying, ""Look, I couldn't tell you who I support. I'm a comedian."" Just like leaving it there. That was the way to advance your career. But now the way to advance your career is to say you're for Hillary.SHILLUE: Well, of course. I mean, everyone out there. Who do we got, Bolling? We've got Vince Vaughn? Is there anyone else in comedy, besides Shillue over here?BOLLING: Gutfeld.SHILLUE: OK, Gutfeld.BOLLING: Also Louis C.K. Can I do a conspiracy theory?PERINO: Sure.BOLLING: I see this coming. I see what this is all about. They've got a Hillary character up there; they have fun. They have some fun; she does a good job. They're all Democrats. Anyway, they're setting this up for right in the middle of the campaign, when it's counting the most, Hillary Clinton is going to show up and host ""SNL.""PERINO: Of course she is.BOLLING: Them both side by side.GUILFOYLE: It's not even a conspiracy. That's just a strategy.BOLLING: How -- she will get so much upside. And she's just going to take the joke. She's not going to be offended by it.PERINO: And you know what?SHILLUE: Why not?PERINO: If a Republican goes and does it and hits the ball out of the park, that would be huge.SHILLUE: Well, I mean, Sarah Palin showed up and she did fine on there, right? She took the joke.One, the narrative of the last election or the one before that was the -- was that Palin was destroyed by Tina Fey. But did that -- was that really true?WILLIAMS: I don't think so at all.PERINO: Tom. Yes.SHILLUE: You do?PERINO: If you are a candidate for president or vice president, and you have an entire primetime special devoted to making fun of your intellect, yes, that's a problem.SHILLUE: But they -- the people who didn't like Sarah Palin laughed at it, but the people who did, they thought it was fun.PERINO: It reinforced stereotypes and myths about her, absolutely.WILLIAMS: I don't think so. I think it made her more of a star than ever. But I can tell you're sensitive on this point. I will say...PERINO: Excuse me?WILLIAMS: You're being sensitive.GUILFOYLE: Ay, yi, yi.WILLIAMS: But I must say, I'm amused by the fact that Kid Rock for the Republicans...GUILFOYLE: Look at the face.WILLIAMS: ... he's a celebrity. He's backing Ben Carson. And what about Mike Huckabee?BOLLING: OK.WILLIAMS: He's in trouble, because we've got the Duggars backing Mike Huckabee.GUILFOYLE: What are you doing? Relaxing over there?SHILLUE: Well, they're after me. OK.GUILFOYLE: Is that a filibuster or something that happened?SHILLUE: They say we've got to go. ""One More Thing"" is up next.GUILFOYLE: What is this?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: It's time now for ""One More Thing."" Eric, what do you have?BOLLING: OK. So if you're squeamish, please look away. You know, cops making traffic stops, sometimes it gets a little testy and it gets a little -- you know, the people who are being stopped get a little -- just watch. This one was caught on tape. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KENNY BOWMAN, POLICE OFFICER (TALKING TO TWO KIDS IN A PLAY CAR): You guys know why I pulled you over today?RYLEE BOWMAN, DAUGHTER: Because we're too cute.K. BOWMAN: What, are you a bunch of wise guys? Why aren't you all buckled up?R. BOWMAN: Mind your business.K. BOWMAN: Let me see you all's driver's license.R. BOWMAN: He has no backup, floor it.K. BOWMAN: Hey!(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: That's very cute. I liked that.BOLLING: That's Officer Kenny Bowman of the Roanoke, Virginia, Police Department and his two kids.SHILLUE: Escalates very quickly.GUILFOYLE: Super cute.BOLLING: Very quickly.GUILFOYLE: Super cute.Tom, hi.SHILLUE: Oh, my ""One More Thing."" OK. 1984, I had to cancel barbershop quartet rehearsals so I could go see The Police...GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.SHILLUE: ... at Boston Garden. Cut to Friday night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARBERSHOP QUARTET (singing): You don't have to put on that red, red light.STING, MUSICIAN (singing): Roxanne, you don't have to put on the red lights.BARBERSHOP QUARTET (singing): Put on the red lights. Don't put on the red lights. Don't put on the red lights. Don't put on that red, red light.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHILLUE: Yes, in case you didn't recognize him with the beard, that is Sting. He grew it for his Broadway show. But it was amazing to be able to sing -- I mean, I never would have thought I would be singing barbershop with Sting.BOLLING: I watched that live. That was fantastic. And I think Fallon said he wants to bring Sting back to do more -- more Police songs.SHILLUE: Yes. We're ready to go.BOLLING: Oh, that's great.GUILFOYLE: Dana. Dana.PERINO: I'm next. OK, because Greg's not here, I'm going to steal this next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Greg's Sports Corner!(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: OK. You wouldn't expect this from me. But I know something is happening in the hockey world. OK. This is the first time since 2000 that both NHL conference final series will be decided in a game seven.The New York Rangers are playing the Tampa Bay Lightning. That's Friday night. And then Chicago Blackhawks and the Anaheim Ducks. That's what they're called?WILLIAMS: Yes.PERINO: OK. So I want to thank @jtm1964. He was my Twitter follower who gave me that suggestion today when I was in a ""One More Thing"" drought.SHILLUE: Oh, my God.GUILFOYLE: Pretty good, though.PERINO: That's pretty impressive.GUILFOYLE: And I want to do a special congratulations from your buddies here at ""The Five"" to FOX News's Greta Van Susteren. Fantastic. Once again, Greta is making the ""Forbes"" 12th annual 100 most powerful women's list. We are very proud of her. It's pretty incredible. She's in the company of Angela Merkel, Hillary Clinton, Melinda Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Sheryl Sandberg, and Michelle Obama.PERINO: And Taylor Swift.GUILFOYLE: Well, I left that out. Greta, you go!WILLIAMS: All right. Well, you know what? It's getting hot out there, so get your grill smoking, because it's National Hamburger Day. Yes, that's right. And the big news today is McDonald's. This is unbelievable to me. McDonald's is changing the way it makes hamburgers. They want to make the buns hotter, so they're going to heat them up for five more seconds. They're also going to do something different with the meat so it's juicier.I don't know. This could be New Coke.GUILFOYLE: Is that it? Are you going to eat it?WILLIAMS: This is McDonald's, buddy. I'm telling you.GUILFOYLE: Are you going to eat it?WILLIAMS: No, I don't -- you know.GUILFOYLE: Come on.WILLIAMS: She took my -- Mom, she took my burger. Oh, Mom.
