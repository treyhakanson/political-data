This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't really understand the Ben Carson thing. I will tell that Ben Carson does not have the aptitude to bring jobs back, does not have the aptitude to deal with China, Japan, Mexico, and any other country you can name. Just doesn't have it, it's not his.CECILY STRONG, 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE': Because of equal time rules for television, Mr. Trump can only speak for four seconds in this promo.TRUMP: So let me just say this -- Ben Carson is a complete and total loser.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: OK, Donald Trump in New Hampshire and in the ""Saturday Night Live"" promo, one of many he's done. We have some new FOX News polls as reported at the beginning of the program. And take a look -- Donald Trump up two points since October, now leading, obviously within the margin of error, over Dr. Ben Carson. But you see Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio also moving up, Jeb Bush dropping down. And you see the rest of the field.If you add the second choice, there you see an interesting list. Ben Carson, first and second choice combined leads, Trump still up there, Rubio next. Take a look at two other polls before I bring in the panel. Most qualified to handle the question, look at this poll, 42 percent, Donald Trump. GOP candidate most qualified to be commander-in-chief, Donald Trump, 19 percent, Ben Carson, 17. And you see the rest.With that, let's bring in the panel: Jason Riley, columnist with The Wall Street Journal, A.B. Stoddard, associate editor of The Hill, and Robert Costa, national political reporter for The Washington Post. Bob, welcome. You look at that and you look at what's happening on the trail, what do you think about Donald Trump and Ben Carson? They seem to be up above the rest.ROBERT COSTA, THE WASHINGTON POST: The outsider wave that's been surging all year shows no signs of receding. Trump and Carson continue to lead nationally. You have seen some strong momentum coming out of the last debate for Senator Cruz and Senator Rubio, and I think many in the Republican establishment are looking especially at Rubio as someone who can come around the corner and be their contender.BAIER: A.B., I'm sure in the next few days we're going to hear this poll cited -- qualified to handle the economy, 42 percent say Donald Trump. This is 1,230 voters, this is Republican primary voters, there is a margin of error, 4.5 percent, but this is such a huge lead.A.B. STODDARD, THE HILL: I think that he's going to remind the kindly doctor that he beats him by 33 points on handling the economy. The doctor is behind Cruz. And also he beats him on 19 points on who can best beat Hillary Clinton in a general election.And the commander-in-chief numbers are only two points apart. And in polling, the general poll they're very tight. I think those numbers are going to be bragging rights for Donald Trump. And, again, he's, he he's behind him in national polls, but this is a good poll for Donald Trump.BAIER: Top issue, let's go to that. Fox News poll four, and facing the country. Deficit government spending at 36 percent, jobs, unemployment, there you see it, and not much of a change from September, but on that issue of the economy, obviously it drives the day.JASON RILEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, it does drive the day. And you'd expect that. That's been the big story of the Obama administration, where are the jobs. A lot of people and of course the employment rate doesn't really reflect, who's not looking for work anymore, or who's looking for work part time but would rather be working full time.So I'm a little surprised that Trump has decided to set aside Ben Carson right now because one of the things this poll shows is Carson's likeability versus Trump. And there Donald Trump is getting creamed by Carson. So that's a little -- I'm not sure that -- that seems very short sighted for him to go there.I think the other thing that struck me about the poll, Bret, is that Jeb Bush has fallen off the cliff here. He is no longer a top tier contender. And it will be interesting to see if the mainstream media coverage reflects that going forward, because the people at the top of that poll whether we're talking about Carson or Trump or Cruz are people that the mainstream media typically likes to condescend to. It will be interesting to see if they treat them as top-tier candidates as they are right now in this race.BAIER: I'll tell you, Bob, you look at the Jeb Bush campaign, they're in their third iteration of a restart. And there are more and more questions about are you getting out. He's obviously pushing back hard against that. But you look at these falling poll numbers. What is your sense of where the Bush is right now?COSTA: I've called around Bush's allies. And they say remember, he's a Bush. He has presidential politics in his blood. So this idea that he's going to quit, they say that doesn't really ring true.But Bush has a difficult proposition ahead of him. How does he win New Hampshire? It's crowded right now up there in the granite state. You have Senator Rubio, Senator Cruz, Governor Kasich, Governor Christie. If you want to be a center-right candidate who gets a bounce out of New Hampshire, that's what Bush wants. For now the field is very crowded.BAIER: I want to look at Fox poll 11, this is honest and trustworthy. It has all of the candidates, Democrat and Republican and how they stack up against each other. Leading in honest and trustworthy, Ben Carson, plus 34. There you see yes and no. You can see all of the other candidates. Sanders is second in the plus column, and there you see Clinton in the bottom in the honest and trustworthy, kind of upside down, right behind Donald Trump. What do you think of that poll?STODDARD: Well, this affirms what was found in the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll out earlier this week. Clinton's numbers, even after her Benghazi testimony on honest and trustworthy are terrible. They're 36-60, the worst of any candidate. And those aren't getting better. She's a known quantity. It will be very hard for her to earn credibility and high marks on character and trustworthiness when she's so known and she remains under FBI investigation. Trump continues to succeed in these polls despite the fact that his numbers are pretty bad as well.BAIER: I do want to play one more sound bit from Donald Trump talking about Marco Rubio and then Rubio's response and how that plays.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)TRUMP: Marco Rubio has a disaster on his finances. He has a disaster on his credit cards. When you check his credit cards, take a look at what he's done with the Republican Party when he had access, what he had to put back in, and whether or not something should have happened. You'll understand it. Marco Rubio has a basic disaster on finance. So let's see what you find. Let's see what kind of a reporter you are. OK? Good luck.(APPLAUSE)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't know what he's talking about. I don't have any debt in the world except my mortgage on our home. He always gets weird whenever his poll numbers go down. He goes off a little bit. So I guess that's what's happening.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BAIER: What about that tactic?RILEY: I think he's taking shots at these other guys. But I think the campaign is most concerned about Ted Cruz.BAIER: The Trump campaign.RILEY: The Trump campaign. I think that long-term is the person who could hurt him most. Carson's numbers have come up, but they haven't come up at Trump's expense. Trump has really maintained pretty level over, you know, throughout the summer. He's still pretty much where he's been in the mid 20s.I think, and what I think is happening in the campaign is you're going to see the other voters, the other side is consolidating around an anti- establishment candidate. And if Trump isn't their guy, the most likely person it could be is Ted Cruz. So then the others will coalesce around an established candidate.BAIER: Bob, last thing. A lot of people get mad that we focus this much on polls this early. It is the marker by which we kind of measure where things are. Organization on the ground, you've been out there. Who is best organized?COSTA: In terms of grassroots fervor and organization on the ground, you have to look to Trump and Carson. I've seen their operations in Iowa. Trump has Rick Santorum's former strategist working on his side in the Hawkeye state. And you see Carson, the enthusiasm for him is letting him have this network grow almost organically. Bush has a great operation in South Carolina, Rubio as well down there. It's pretty competitive all-around.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Eric Bolling and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five."" We hope you all had a great holiday weekend. It's good to be back. And it's the Labor Day weekend and in a presidential year, a traditionally marks the start of the final sprint to Election Day, now exactly nine weeks away. The nominees made their way to two battleground states today; Trump was in Virginia and Clinton in Florida. Trump has taken the lead in a new national poll for the first time since the GOP convention. He tops Clinton by two points in the CNN/ORC survey. The latest Fox News polls shows Clinton ahead by two points so, folks, we've got ourselves a tight race right now. Over the long weekend, you might have noticed that Hillary got a bigger plane, that's because she's now allowing press to travel with her. But on day one, they certainly didn't impress her very hard.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do you think?HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I think it's pretty cool. Don't you?(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: I am so happy to have all of you with me.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Have you missed us?CLINTON: I mean, I just waiting for this moment.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How was your Labor Day weekend?CLINTON: It was good.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you ready?CLINTON: I'm ready. I'm more than ready. Are you ready, Ruth (ph)?(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: Has Ruth (ph) that taking good care of you?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.(CROSSTALK)(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: So they've been waiting for a chance to ask her questions and they got a few that they wanted. Kimberly, you're a competitor. You got your sneakers laced up for the final sprint?KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Exactly.PERINO: On the way to Election Day, just nine weeks away. And we -- and we've said on the show that we think that the polls would tighten in September as they usually do, and they certainly have.GUILFOYLE: Indeed they have. So, you know, never a dull moment. We're still waiting for the October surprise with bated breath for the next three weeks. But, you know, it's good to see Hillary Clinton out and about. Let's see. So now she has the captive audience right on the plane and we'll see if we get some more questions answered. Obviously, a lot happening now with the, you know, e-mails, the FBI release, the -- while you were gone Dana .PERINO: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: . the documents up on Friday. So a lot still to talk about and to go (inaudible), obviously some cause for concern within her camp and her circle regarding the numbers and the tightening, which you did predict.PERINO: The -- well, not just me, but that's just typically what happens in September. And so Trump, Eric, has been doing better. Hillary has been doing worse. And I guess what we found out is that -- remember when Bernie Sanders said to her in that first debate, ""nobody cares about your damn e- mails"" and it was seen as like, OK now she's going to be able to get over the hump, he gave her the pass. But the truth is people are caring about the e-mails, mostly because her trustworthy numbers are so far down in the dumps.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Yeah, but -- actually her numbers aren't going that far down. I think she only dipped in the CNN/ORC poll, she only dipped a little bit and this Trump whose numbers are going higher, which is helping, helping, you know --PERINO: Close that gap.BOLLING: Yeah. Nor he actually flipped it in the last four --PERINO: In that --BOLLING: . national polls. But he's doing it through the independents, 20 percent on that CNN poll, 20 percent lead in the independents over Hillary Clinton. That's huge. Trump versus Clinton has the lead or plus 6 percent Trump. On the same weekend, the ISIS claims they have thousands of jihadists are in Europe right now, waiting to strike Trump wins on fighting terror up 6 percent, in that as well. So, my point here is that he has the enthusiasm, he has the engagement. He has the 88 military advisers, admirals and generals who signed on to his campaign today and he also has now also what seems to be a flip in the polls. I mean, it looks very good. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton has been ducking the media, fund-raising in the Hamptons and nagging the persistent cough. So, it doesn't surprise me that he's flipped the script on her.PERINO: I guess we're going to get to talk about the so-called cough controversy in the next block, so you can stay tuned for that. Greg, Eric mentioned enthusiasm. And in that poll, one of the things that show is that for democratic voters that are committed to voting for Hillary that compared to previous years they're not as enthusiastic about voting as they were for Obama, but Trump committed voters are very enthusiastic by that same comparison. So, maybe he's .GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: I think the --PERINO: . locked them up.GUTFELD: I think the enthusiasm Trump is directly related to the hatred for Hillary. Whenever you talk to somebody about Trump, it's the first thing that comes out of their mouth is how much they hate Hillary. When you see what's going on with, on that plane is, what you see is this kind of arrogance of familiarity that she's been around so long that she somehow exempt from serious questions. It's that is like, it's like asking Mario Andretti how to change oil. You know she's the kind of guy, you know asking Stephen Hawking the square root of 36. For her, this is also beneath her. So like all those questions it's like, or the assumption that, you know, you're not supposed to really challenge me.PERINO: Though, it's not all roses for Donald Trump. In some of the battleground states, Juan, you see that she continues to have a pretty good lead in some of those places. However, I would say, we saw today the National Democratic Senatorial Committee is going to pull out of Ohio, which looks like the republican Rob Portman is going to be able to win that state, which might be good for Trump, too.JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Right. So the former governor, the democrat, just doesn't seem to have it. And by the fact that they are pulling out Dana, I think it's clarification (ph) that he think that he's going to win, that Portman is going to win. But I'm surprised that it's still a race in so many other states for republicans. Pennsylvania. I thought Pat Toomey would pull away. That's not the case right now. You look at New Hampshire, Kelly Ayotte versus the Governor Maggie Hassan. And again, you just think, whoa, how much is Trump hurting down ballot republicans, because the Republican National Committee is supporting Donald Trump. And I mean, if they, if Trump's team has ground gained anywhere, it's because the Republican National Committee has helped him. He has not built an infrastructure for a campaign. So part of the talk right now is, yeah, look at the polls, but also consider the electoral college and look at those swing states. Swing states often having senate races in them. And boy, those swing states right now look at favor Clinton.PERINO: Yeah, Hillary Clinton was asked about these poll numbers, when they're not good for you. This is what she had to say about them.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Well, I really pay no attention to polls. When they're good for me and there have been a lot of them that have been good for me recently, I don't pay attention. When they're, you know, not so good, I don't pay attention. We, we are on a course that we are sticking with. We feel very good about where we are. But we're not taking anything for granted. And we're going to work every single minute.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: I did think that, Kimberly, today that the democrats might have been getting a little complacent in August, when I saw the poll numbers with the wider gap. Now that they're narrowing, it might kick them in the rear end.GUILFOYLE: Sure. A little bit of cause for concern. And then all of a sudden, you know, Hillary hasn't materialized. So let's see. I mean, I think she's gonna has to really put in some face time, answer some questions, be present, because there's a lot of, you know, doubt in terms of credibility, honesty, integrity, you know, in light of the e-mail scandal and how this has developed and the rollout on that, and on the Clinton Foundation. So she cannot be a candidate in hiding, for whatever reason you might attribute the tightening, you know, in the polls. And I think there are a variety of factors both for and against her that would suggest some why some of this has tightened up. She's got to do something. This isn't going to be easy. You know, (inaudible). This is race is much closer than they would have thought already at this point.PERINO: And Eric, she spent a ton of money on ads already and --GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: It seems like traditional television ads are not having the same effect as they have in the past.BOLLING: Yes, I wonder if the strategy is flawed. And so she stayed below the radar for August. She raised $145 million doing a lot of high-profile fund-raisers, a lot of celebrity fund-raisers raise a lot of money, and if they're not working -- she has had some pretty -- what would seem to be effective ads recently so the last couple, but they're not, but it's not resonating, I guess with the polling. Can I take a little bit of issue with what Juan said? I don't think Donald Trump is affecting at least in that senate down ballot, whatsoever. I mean, look at Portman, McCain, Rubio, Toomey, even Ayotte and maybe one or two others. There all the republicans are at least ahead or -- actually, ahead. Yeah, that's all.WILLIAMS: No, that's not ahead.BOLLING: She -- but she got --WILLIAMS: But you look at -- look at to say.BOLLING: But she`s very, very close. All of those --WILLIAMS: Here's the --BOLLING: As opposed to what establishment and leftists said, well, if you elect Donald Trump and he doesn't win the presidency, you're going to lose the Senate. It certainly not playing out that way, as of right now.WILLIAMS: Well, the odds still are right now. Democrats capture the Senate. But I was going to point here --BOLLING: By whom?WILLIAMS: ""New York Times"" just said it was 56 percent.BOLLING: ""New York Times"" said it?WILLIAMS: No, I mean everybody --BOLLING: Because I'm looking at these individual races and that's not the case --WILLIAMS: What is the case?(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Let me just speak for a second. I was going to say to you that actually, one place where Trump has many gains that really surprised me was Wisconsin. I think he has gained like 10 points. But you look at a state like Wisconsin and look at Ron Johnson, Johnson, right now running against former Senator Russ Feingold. Johnson is nowhere near, not in the race. And people including Ayotte, Johnson, Toomey -- what are they doing Eric? They're staying away from Trump. They don't endorse Trump. They say, oh, I got nothing to say about it, and it becomes fodder for the democrats.BOLLING: But given the use of Senate races, they don't flip the Senate.WILLIAMS: Oh yes, they --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: No, I'm just telling you --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: . right now, right now it looks like they flip the Senate. This is part of a larger thing. What we're talking today .BOLLING: Based on what?WILLIAMS: . about --BOLLING: On ""New York Times"" assessment of 56 percent chance of it?WILLIAMS: No, no, I'm just saying you look at -- well, you look at the people who do the statistical analysis of the odds.BOLLING: Fifty six or 54?WILLIAMS: But I must say, 54-56 is not what it was before, so your points well-taken.PERINO: Yeah, it's very close. And so no matter what, it's got probably going to be -- whoever has the majority will be, it will be like 51-49 at the end of the day, whether it's republicans or democrats --WILLIAMS: But what's strike s me Dana, is that -- (inaudible) in the ""Washington Post"" I think, ""Washington Post"" in a 50-state survey. Biggest surprise in the poll, Texas is even. Who would have thought? It's possible? That's what because of Trump.PERINO: It's do you think that -- but do you think that's politics or demographics?WILLIAMS: You look at what ""The Dallas Morning News"" this morning, had an endorsement, or not an endorsement --PERINO: Well, ""The Dallas Morning News"" -- yes.WILLIAMS: Go ahead. You want to --PERINO: Well, ""The Dallas Morning News"" today did an editorial and it -- for the first time since 1964, they have decided not to endorse and they're closing line was that Donald Trump does not deserve your vote. But I don't know if that -- I don't how the state by state polling, that the ""Washington Post"" did, I just don't know how much stock to put in that. I think that Texas -- if it's not close this time around in 2016, it will be closer by 2020. We know that because of demographics.WILLIAMS: Well, you look at places like Georgia. You look at Arizona. You see, that's the flip side of this is people are looking at Electoral College.PERINO: But if Trump is able to get Wisconsin?BOLLING: Yeah.WILLIAMS: I don't think --PERINO: Right?WILLIAMS: He's going to have to get all of the swing states.BOLLING: Yeah, but Juan, you look at --WILLIAMS: It is such a monumental set.BOLLING: You said was --WILLIAMS: I don't mind.BOLLING: How about Pennsylvania? Pennsylvania hasn't gone, hasn't gone red in .WILLIAMS: he is close right now in Pennsylvania.BOLLING: Eight presidential cycles.WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: How about, you know, Ohio. They didn't win Ohio --WILLIAMS: He's ahead.BOLLING: For the last time.WILLIAMS: I'll say he's a little bit ahead.BOLLING: And he's ahead in (inaudible) too.PERINO: And so the good news is, Greg, that we have a race.GUTFELD: I'm sorry, I tuned out.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: I think it. I could see it. Even Kimberly and I are like that, totally lost you.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: And I've only got back for eight minutes.GUTFELD: Yeah, I mean, we're entering like the third act of the movie, you know, the scene where in Jaws where it's just them and the shark and the boat. This is where -- we are, we got like, it's the homestretch. And I think what will really move the polls are two things; the world, 2016 is the year that the universe screwed everything. I mean, there was bad news every time, and that affects the polls. It may not have anything to do with Trump or Hillary. It's like I do think that people have made up their minds about who they hate. And it's pretty equal on both sides. So I think the -- what happens to the environment, in the world will have an effect, and perhaps the debates. And I think the debates will also you'll, you have two people to compare and which one you like more. I don't know but --PERINO: And I read today, Kimberly .GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: . there's only five to six percent undecided. So that between -- in the next 63 days, both Trump and Hillary will be trying to convince 5 to 6 percent of the electorate to vote for them.GUILFOYLE: Like trying to like grab the last three cocktail olives on the table. Yeah, and it's like Greg divide them up, trying to split it. But that's the point, they should be focus on exactly who that is, the undecided, and who they can like shave points off, because a lot of these days it's very close, of course, nationally as well.PERINO: Juan?GUTFELD: You know I think for most people when they listen to this non -- these talk about polling and they listen to the polls tightening, and they listen to the battleground. It's like when 2:00 am radio stations overlap. And there -- but you're hearing two different songs.GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: But they may not be wrong. But they just happen to be at the same time and it's like, she's got him beat on the battleground, but he's closing the gap.GUILFOYLE: On the national --GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: So that's why it's so interesting and why they chose this block for us to do today.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: Ahead -- I'm sorry. I apologize to Kimberly and Eric -- and Greg.GUILFOYLE: What about Juan?WILLIAMS: What?PERINO: Well, I think Juan was engaged. Juan was engaged.WILLIAMS: Oh.PERINO: He was loving it. And Eric was rallying. That's true.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: All right, ahead, trying to make a big deal out of Hillary's health. Greg's take on the latest coughing controversy -- that's next.(coughing).(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: It was a hack even Julian Assange couldn't match.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: (coughing).(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: (coughing) I've been talking so --(coughing)CLINTON: Every time I think about Trump, I get allergic.(LAUGHTER)(coughing)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: At least she cough (ph) loud.GUTFELD: It's like she smoked a pack of camels and not the cigarettes, the actual animals. She coughed so hard, butterflies in China died. Now maybe she had a frog in her throat and perhaps she's a shape-shifting space lizard trying to communicate with her overlords. Either way, such fits feed into the rumor, which is why she can now just laugh it off. Because the more you cry conspiracy, the harder it is to make a case when it's real.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you concerned about conspiracy theories about your health and whether that will affect the election, and are you concerned separately about the tightening polls to Donald Trump?CLINTON: I'm not concerned about the conspiracy theories. There are so many of them, I've lost track of them. And so I pay no attention to them.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: But her health should matter. And so should Trump's. Together they're 140 years old or one Larry King. So we care about her cough than we should care about Trump's doctor note, too, scribbled mad lib that wouldn't get you out of fifth-grade gym class. And remember, Donald himself said Hillary's health should be off limits, which is odd. And why we need transparency from both of them. It's absurd that we rely on their people and not an objective, agreeable third party to run thorough physicals. Keep the private stuff private, but tell us what matters. And I don't want to know about embarrassing birth marks. Lord knows I have a few, a mole that looks like Lou Dobbs. But the heart and the brain, this stuff matters. Make it fair game for both candidates. No notes and no conspiracies, just the facts. Of course, this means I could never run for president. You would have to handle my specimen collections with oven mitts.GUILFOYLE: Gosh.GUTFELD: Sorry, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Oh.GUTFELD: Why didn't anybody give her a cough drop? I think she got one later --GUILFOYLE: Well, that's the thing. I have them in my pants pocket, right? It's just like --GUTFELD: Remember that (inaudible)?GUILFOYLE: I know.GUTFELD: You used to have, like 30 cough drops.GUILFOYLE: In case of emergency. They were always here on the table .GUTFELD: On the table.GUILFOYLE: . and it's like pop one. Yeah, that's what happens. But also why didn't he go up? Why did he can't go up and, you know -- I don't know. He should have gone been told one of Dana's -- corny jokes?(CROSSTALK)PERINO: All she finishes is --GUILFOYLE: Right? Anything. Why did the chicken cross the street? Something to kind of just divert away for a moment, and also which .(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: . and help her out. Right, give --GUTFELD: Yeah, we just showed -- I mean, we could -- we would have had a seven-minute segment to show the whole thing. So we can only show.GUILFOYLE: You had to cut it?GUTFELD: We had to cut it .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: . for time, for space. Juan, was it just a cough or could it be something more sinister?(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: Yeah, like a vast right -wing conspiracy? I think that could be the problem. I think you got that, she definitely. Whatever virus it is, she's caught it. I mean, it's -- to me, it's intriguing that, you know, her opponents. But even Trump, Rudy Giuliani, they keep saying, oh, go, check on her health. I just don't get it. You know the fact-checkers, the doctors, it's just no comparison. And y comparison, when you look at that note on Donald Trump's health, he would be the healthiest president ever signed by a guy named -- it was the doctor (inaudible). And what he did was he said, oh I just slipped this off in five minutes while the car was waiting, and Trump -- you think well, that's a joke. But again, it's the low bar Trump's health to versus anything Hillary does, call out the five alarms.GUTFELD: But why can't they just have an objective person like -- I mean that, they both candidates go, and I mean, that would solve everything.WILLIAMS: Sure. I think right. Yeah.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: I think Dana, they were questioned that months ago, they should both submit to an independent physician to do a full up and down exam. But here is why it's not so much a conspiracy theory. As recently as Friday we learned that 40 times during the FBI interview she said ""I can't remember."" Something -- if you've never been interviewed by the FBI, you kind of remember what they want to hear, 40 times in the span of a couple of hours, she couldn't remember something. She also had head trauma. Remember she was supposed to testify on Benghazi but she had, she had the fall. And she had head trauma and she had delayed the testimony. When she finally did testify, she had to come back with -- remember one of her, one of the lenses in her glasses was darkly shaded. Rand Paul, who is a surgeon, said that's likely due to some sort of head trauma that she took to the brain.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: The shell of the covering of the brain underneath the .(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: . underneath skull, so there may be some trauma. So call it what you want, call it right vast right-wing conspiracy .(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: . but when things happen where you're electing the next most powerful human being on the planet, you want to make sure that everything is OK. I'm not suggesting it's not, but let's make sure. Yeah.GUTFELD: You know, I agree. I think that's should the same for Hillary, the same for Trump. The note is the thing that freaks me out just the way her cough -- I mean the cough was a little bit alarming. But I don't know how a cough goes with a concussion.PERINO: I don't see how -- I just don't see how it's alarming. I mean, I -- the concussion thing, I grant you, like that would -- you would want to check that out --GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: She can't remember all these things in an FBI interview and she has said she was perfectly fine. But then she's blaming the concussion .GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: . in the FBI interview. I think that's suspects, but I don't see how a cough and concussion are related. And it does scream like -- they can't say she was born in Nigeria or like suggest that.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: So like now the suggestion is, oh, OK, well maybe she's going to .(CROSSTALK)PERINO: . die. You know, it is, it does seem a little bit absurd. But the health issues in presidents are always absurd. Do you guys remember when President Bush was watching the football game and ate a pretzel, it went down the wrong way and it was like international news for five days because ...GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: . he choked on a pretzel.GUTFELD: Remember the older -- it was the elder Bush threw up in Japan?PERINO: Yes, and there were all the conspiracies about that.GUTFELD: That's why I could never be president.GUILFOYLE: But the point is you should check out the house and make sure anybody who is running for president just has a clean bill of health --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: By the standard, she met the standard. She gave a note from her long-term doctor. He --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: . independent.WILLIAMS: No.GUTFELD: I don't think she did.WILLIAMS: Wait, wait. All I'm saying is this thing standard is your doctor sends a fully vetted note. You see, I've examined this person. Here is their state of health. Donald Trump sends something from a gastro internist.GUILFOYLE: Gastroenterologist.WILLIAMS: I mean the guy says, oh, I'm (inaudible) and uses the craziest language, everything is positive. You said positive from a doctor.GUTFELD: You don't want to hear positive from a doctor.WILLIAMS: You don't want to hear that. I mean it is, but I love --GUTFELD: I know.WILLIAMS: I love the conspiracy stuff about, oh, the secret service agent is really carrying some kind of pen in case she has a seizure, oh, that bulk on the back her. Dana, you must have heard this one. The bulk on the back of her, that's the (inaudible) in case she has --PERINO: Oh, I hadn't heard that.WILLIAMS: Just like extremes. It's nutty.GUTFELD: All right. We got to move on. We got so much more. Clinton and Trump go to war over who is more fit to be commander-in-chief. Stay tuned for that.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: One of many important questions voters should ask themselves this election cycle, who is more fit to be our next commander-in-chief? Clinton and Trump will take part of commander-in-chief forum tomorrow where they'll address national security and military issues. Today, Clinton released a harsh attack ad trying to paint Trump as bad for our veterans.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I know more about ISIS than the generals do. John McCain, a war hero. He is not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured, OK?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Donald Trump compared his sacrifices to the sacrifices of two parents who lost their son in war.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: How would you answer that father? What sacrifices have you made for your country?TRUMP: I think I've made a lot of sacrifices, built great structures. I've had tremendous success. I think I've done a lot.STEPHANOPOULOS: Those are sacrifices?(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Meanwhile, Trump earned the endorsement of 88 vets today, all retired generals and admirals. They find an open letter urging voters to elect the republican nominee. Both candidates addressed this today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We really appreciate all of those generals and admirals that today endorsed me. These are our fighters. These are our fighting generals and they're actually a lot more to come.CLINTON: I now have more endorsements from retired like officers than any democrat other than an incumbent president has ever had. Compare where Trump is with where both Romney and McCain were. They had between 300 and 500. I'm doing better than any democrat. He's doing worse than recent republicans.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: OK. So, Dana, she has her talking points ready there and the numbers. Do you think that this helps Trump? Is her statement against him showing to the contrary people?PERINO: I think the numbers get a little lost for people. Like, you won't necessarily -- when you go to the polls, you won't necessarily remember, ""Oh, yes, 500. She has 200, 300, whatever."" I mean, that gets a little bit lost.I do think that the ad was effective, if you are targeting people who are on the fence, and if you're in the military. The military has actually been pretty strong for Trump. But not all. So, I think that her ad was effective, mostly because I just like the tactics, whether you're Trump or Hillary, of using their words to make your point; and I think that she did that pretty well.GUILFOYLE: OK, what did you think about the ad? Did she use it effectively, Dana said, to make her case? She has the support, but she's pointing out not just on past Democratic candidates but also beating out numbers from former Republican candidates.BOLLING: Well, I'm not sure that -- I think that I agree with Dana on that, the numbers get kind of lost. What did she say more flight officers?PERINO: Flag officers.So Romney had 500 and Trump has 88. But I think that that's a pretty good organization from the Trump campaign.BOLLING: And there's time still. It's not like this is it.But, again, these -- the -- ISIS claiming that they have thousands of jihadists in Europe ready to go, you need one of these strikes; and clearly, the American people, through polls, have spoken and said, as far as fighting terror, Trump is the one you want as your president for fighting terror. So you have that on one side.I think the ad is effective. I think the ad when she used children watching Donald Trump using his own words...PERINO: His own words.BOLLING: Those are effective. But remember, that ad has been running up until -- it's still running. I saw it today. And the numbers aren't working for her. So these ads are moments in time. I'm not sure they're really affecting, you know, long-term numbers.GUILFOYLE: Yes. In terms of the battleground states and what he wants to do to get more independents, or get women, what do you think the impact is?WILLIAMS: Well, I think it's a good ad. And, you know, I think the children's ad is a good ad. What we're talking about with the polls is the direction -- I think that's what I would notice, by the way, Eric, is the direction has been toward Trump.But I think that, overall, as we get into this post-Labor Day session, what you're looking for are things that begin to move. Now Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are going to do some kind of national security forum on NBC Wednesday night. So they're going to get real questions.Again, for people who are interested, for people who haven't made up their minds -- there are not many of them left. If they watch, they're going to see who is -- which person here is better prepared.And that's what, when people like Michael Hayden and John Negroponte -- Hayden's the former CIA director; Negroponte, former director of national intelligence -- backed Hillary Clinton, they said Trump just doesn't know anything about foreign policy, doesn't know, doesn't have the experience.Now, Eric says, ""Oh, but the voters say they like Trump better."" I think voters who are angry or fearful say, ""We respond to Trump."" But over the course of this year, I've been watching those numbers, Eric. And it's interesting. They go back and forth.BOLLING: That was a CNN poll out today.WILLIAMS: Yes, I'm saying they go back and forth. I thought it was going to be always Trump, but it's not always Trump. Sometimes Hillary is trusted more than Trump on national security.GUILFOYLE: To Gregory.GUTFELD: The -- well, the advantage that Trump has is that he doesn't have Hillary's past. I mean, you say that Trump is inexperienced, but then you compare that to somebody whose experience is awful.I mean, and so she is tied to a previous administration. So he had -- he - - there are two variables that were mentioned, strength and stability. Trump is heavy on strength, but you don't know about the stability. With her, you think maybe she's stable, but is she strong? We don't know.Then you have this visceral relationship that people have with these candidates that is almost like a personal relationship. They feel strongly about these people. Candidate endorsement, change your mind. If you were considering dating somebody that you knew, and that somebody -- that person got an endorsement of 50 people, it's not going to change your mind. You're still going to hate that person. I really do think people have strong reactions towards Hillary, strong reactions towards Trump.And I'm not sure. It's not like you're comparing two SUVs from ""Consumer Reports,"" you know, and you're going, like, this one has little black circles, and this one has little red circles. No, this is like you're already coming at this from a fairly strong perspective. And I don't know if this stuff is going to help at this point.GUILFOYLE: All right. Excellent.Next, the FBI drops a bombshell on Friday. A big one. And it's a report on the investigation of Hillary Clinton. They tried to bury the news right before the holiday weekend. But, uh-uh, we've got a lot more to say about it. So, stick around.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: So, a lot of people are making hay about the FBI's release of its report on Hillary Clinton, right before the Labor Day weekend, last Friday. That's when most people might not be paying attention to the report. Mark Halperin is one of them with tough criticism for FBI director Jim Comey.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK HALPERIN, MSNBC SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: He released this on Friday as if he's an arm of the Clinton campaign. If he really cared about transparency, you would say to yourself, is the best time to release this, to get a full public hearing, on Friday before Labor Day?I really believe that he has called his own impartiality into question by what he's done. The number of new legitimate questions raised by this material is -- it's too many. It doesn't mean she should have been indicted, necessarily, but it does mean -- necessarily. But it does mean there are a lot of questions that the FBI didn't follow up on.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Now, this is really interesting to me, because from my perspective, Kimberly...GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: ... Jim Comey -- remember, he went on and on about what he found and her reckless behavior before he finally said he wasn't going to indict her. Right? And a lot of people thought, ""Well, gee.""And then Republicans call for him to release this report. But now it's Republicans who are saying why did you release it on the Friday before Labor Day?GUILFOYLE: Well, because that's like the oldest political move in the book, especially before Labor Day or a holiday weekend. You dump on a Friday to try and bury it so it doesn't, like, carry the news cycle for multiple days. I mean, smart.But from the FBI, I mean, that's something her campaign would do or anybody else, you know, running for office, if there's something you had to give up or release, et cetera, tax records or something like that, or unfavorable medical records, you would expect that. That's how the game is played in the house of cards. But this, from Comey, is bad.WILLIAMS: An attack on the FBI?BOLLING: I think -- by whom?WILLIAMS: By people who are saying, ""You look like you're an arm of the Clinton camp.""BOLLING: So there was no reason to wait until, I think it was, 1 p.m. or 2 p.m. on Friday when they said there probably was something coming out. I think on Tuesday they said probably by the end of the week something will come out. They had plenty of time. I'm sure they weren't finishing up the report. I mean, it wasn't a report. They were just handing over these notes. I mean, that's something that's probably been there for a long time.Don't forget: Comey went through that long list that you reminded us about but then recommended no indictment.WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: Which went a step further than I think he should have gone.It's also -- to dump this and with this much information that we didn't know about the 13 devices, not one or two like she claimed, that they disposed of them with a hammer, which is insane. Forty times she said she didn't recall. And in this one, ""C,"" she didn't know ""C"" was ""confidential."" Well, where's the follow-up question? If ""C"" didn't know it was confidential, were you worried about what ""A"" and ""B"" were? There was no question, if ""C"" wasn't -- if that was alphabetical, where were the rest of them, the alphabet? It didn't make sense. I think -- I think there's a legitimate case that Comey has removed himself as impartial.WILLIAMS: Really? Wow. OK.PERINO: I think the FBI looks bad.WILLIAMS: Yes.PERINO: If it had been the White House in its purview to do it on a Friday, you could kind of think, well, that's politics. But it is the FBI. They're supposed to be independent. I do think that's different.I ultimately point people to the column by Bill McGurn in The Wall Street Journal today, because all those questions that Eric raised were -- or said were raised by the FBI report are true.But there's also another troubling thing, which is that you realize, in all these reports, that the civil servants at the State Department, which is supposed to -- they work for us; they work for the taxpayers. They did nothing. And it took a hacker not a whistleblower to blow -- to blow this up.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: And so the civil service was in on it.WILLIAMS: I got it.PERINO: The civil service, your government employees, were in on it; and they didn't do anything about it. That's bad.WILLIAMS: They didn't say...PERINO: Because she said, ""Everybody knew I was using e-mail.""WILLIAMS: They didn't say to her, ""Hey, you know what? We have a policy here, and you're in violation of it by using a private server.""GUTFELD: What does -- what does this document dump tell you about what they think about you?PERINO: Right.GUTFELD: They think that your attention span can't outlast a weekend. They're -- they think that Americans are so stupid that, if we dump something on a Friday, by Monday we'll already forget.Imagine if you tried to do this in real life on a spouse. Like you waited until the day before Labor Day to tell your wife that you blew all your savings on online poker. Do you think by Monday she's going to actually go, ""Oh, hey, how is everything going?"" No, because spouses never forget anything you do.But somehow, they think that, like, ""Oh, we just dump something, we just move on. The news cycle will carry it away."" Pearl Harbor -- Pearl Harbor happened on Friday.WILLIAMS: There's a high bar for Hillary Clinton. I mean, you look at the foundation. Trump's not -- talking about her.BOLLING: Again, this is the FBI, right? I mean, this isn't the campaign.GUILFOYLE: That's the problem. That's what we're saying.WILLIAMS: I've got to -- I've got to serve my higher masters, who want me to cut you guys off.Stay right there, because ""The Fastest 7"" with Dr. Bolling up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Welcome back. Time for...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GRAPHIC: Fastest 7(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: ... ""The Fastest Few Minutes on Television."" Three significant stories, seven swift minutes, one sagacious host.First off, Donald Trump's opponent likes to hit him on his temperament. She did it again yesterday, but it's one of his best qualities, according to the GOP nominee.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: She says things about me that are horrible. As an example, the single greatest asset I have, according to those who know me, is my temperament. But she came up with this Madison Avenue line, let's talk about his temperament. It's the single greatest asset I have is my temperament.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Now, Greg, would you agree?GUTFELD: No, I wouldn't. But I mean, if that's his best quality, what does that make his other qualities?I happen to think that his -- maybe his temperament is really good in private, among people. But when he's out in front of an audience, he really gets into the impulsive nature of a crowd reaction, and that changes his temperament. But in private, you don't have that. So you end up becoming more -- you don't have a cheering squad.BOLLING: Temperament, tell me about it.GUILFOYLE: Yes. I mean, I don't know. I've known him for over ten years, and he's very pleasant. The whole family really nice, the kids. Melania, super nice. So I would -- I would vote for her as best asset, along with his children.But he's been, I think, pretty measured and pretty controlled in terms of he's been on prompter. He's been on message, focused and has given some really great powerful speeches. And I think you've seen that in terms of the tightening of the polls. So it seems to be working very well for him.BOLLING: Dana, is it possible that sometimes these Twitter wars to change your actual real temperament?PERINO: Or exposes your real temperament?BOLLING: Or in Trump's case...PERINO: Yes, I guess that's possible. I think that -- remember, the exit polls, one of the things that Republican voters liked about him the most is that he was a guy that would tell it like it is. So yes, those voters like his temperament. And those are the people that he knows. So he can't keep trying to win those 40 million people over and over again.The reason Hillary Clinton says that, I imagine, is that, in their focus group testing -- because you know they test every single thing -- they know that saying that he has a bad temperament works for them with the key audiences that they need to energize, like college-educated white women.GUILFOYLE: A trigger word.BOLLING: Bring us home, Juan.WILLIAMS: Well, I think it's the tweets, don't you? I mean, in the middle of the night he says horrible things. On the debate stage when we saw him with the Republicans, gosh, you know, he would just go off with people and say incredible things. I just think that's the problem. And you see this also in terms of the praise for Putin and dictators. And you think, so that's who he admires?BOLLING: All right. Let's do this one. In 2003, the Black-Eyes Peas released the song ""Where is the Love"" in response to the 9/11 attacks. Thirteen years later, they've come out with a remake that spotlights the refugee crisis and the Black Lives Matter movement.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(BLACK-EYED PEAS, ""WHERE IS THE LOVE REMAKE"")(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: What do you say, Juan?WILLIAMS: You know, I love that song. I didn't realize, by the way, that they haven't had a song in so long. Did they -- did they stop making music until now?BOLLING: I didn't know that. Does anyone know that? Greg?GUTFELD: No, I -- I try to avoid their music at all costs.WILLIAMS: Why? You didn't like that song?GUTFELD: I find them highly irritating.GUILFOYLE: No, it's because she was out doing a solo career and making some albums, and now this is -- they're back together.WILLIAMS: Oh.BOLLING: You like it?GUILFOYLE: Sure, I like them. I've seen them perform.BOLLING: Dana.PERINO: I would just make a political point, which is that on the refugee issue, on the Syrian refugee issue, I appreciate Hollywood or music industry wanting to get involved and help. Here's how you can show the love.Support a policy that would allow for us to actually do something there. So don't -- don't scream if there's going to be action on the ground.GUTFELD: I mean, it's the first time I've heard it. And the lyrics was ""distracted by drama."" Who's distracted by drama? Not us. And they -- there's also this kind of message like how we don't understand the issue. Who are they talking about? Who are they talking about?BOLLING: Well, maybe a lot of the audience -- their own audience.GUTFELD: Yes, that could be it.BOLLING: Finally, this one: 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick still won't stand for the national anthem, and many Americans are outraged but not President Obama.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He's exercising his constitutional right to make a statement. And I don't doubt his sincerity, based on what I've heard. I think he cares about some real, legitimate issues that have to be talked about. And, you know, if nothing else, what he's done is he's generated, you know, more conversation around some topics that need to be talked about.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right, K.G., your thoughts?GUILFOYLE: He played it safe, right? I mean, he's not going to say he doesn't have the right to do it, because he's president of the United States that fought to have these freedoms and liberties and First Amendment rights that people like Colin Kaepernick and the Black-Eyed Peas enjoy every day.So he has the right tone that he needed to. He certainly wasn't going to say anything disparaging about him or question, you know, his decision, because it's a personal one for Colin Kaepernick to make. Doesn't mean that, you know, any one at this table would make the same.BOLLING: Juan, did you hear that he converted to Islam a couple of months ago? Did you hear this? I had heard this. I don't know if this is true, but you want to talk about an oppressive place...GUILFOYLE: You mean Colin not...BOLLING: Colin. Not president -- yes. No, Colin Kaepernick, K.G..BOLLING: Did you not hear this? When we were talking about this, I mean, I say essentially what Obama said. He has the right. NFL said he has the right to do it. But what strikes me is that it's spreading. It's not receding, even though I think it's wrong as a way to reach out and persuade people.And now you have a white female soccer star saying the criticism is from people who want a black man to be put in his place. I think that seems to be spreading.PERINO: The president had days to come up with that answer. He didn't answer it until he was in China. But that's about it. And I do think he was right. He has the right to do it. But I also think that President Obama could have said, ""I've been president of this amazing country for eight years. I've traveled the world. Here I am, and I will tell you that America is the best country for all of us to be living in and everyone in the world should aspire to be like us. And yes, we can do better, and we will do better. But standing for the national anthem, that should be a minimum requirement for citizenship.GUILFOYLE: Not going to do it.GUTFELD: Again, when the leader of a country you claim is oppressed applauds your dissent, the country is not oppressed. You aren't speaking truth to power when the power has your back.BOLLING: All right. We've got to leave it right there.GUILFOYLE: Nice!BOLLING: ""One More Thing"" next.GUILFOYLE: The power's got your back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Welcome back to ""The Five."" It's time for ""One More Thing."" Kimberly, kick us off.GUILFOYLE: Thank you, Dana.Well, after 14 years here at the FOX News Channel, we bid a farewell to my friend, Greta Van Susteren. Today, it was announced that Greta is leaving the channel and will be embarking on a new chapter. I'm personally excited to see what the future has in store for her. And we will miss the great work that she did here.And in particular, since Greta didn't get to sign off, I know that she would want to thank her staff, which is absolutely incredible, the job they've done on ""On the Record,"" and I can attest to that personally, having been in for her on many occasions.Now, Brit Hume is going to take over as host of ""On the Record"" through the election day. This is a great choice for this exciting presidential race. And we wish him and the staff all the best, and to Greta, as well.PERINO: Indeed. All right, Greg.GUTFELD: Last week, remember we talked about how Florida State receiver Travis Rudolph sat with a young autistic boy, it was in the Tallahassee middle school. Well, he surprised Beau (ph) and his mother again and showed up and gave him a football jersey.And it always makes me think, there should be a program where athletes go and just -- you match athletes with kids who could use a bodyguard or two.PERINO: Really nice.All right, Eric.BOLLING: Not only that, massive comeback last week. All right. Let's go, very quickly. Eric Chase, one of the schools he was looking at, Ohio State University. What would happen in his organic chem class? The teacher offered anyone who could sink this shot gets an ""A"" on the quiz the whole class. Go.PERINO: The whole class?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(CHEERING)(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: The whole class.PERINO: That's pretty fun.GUTFELD: Isn't that wrong, though?BOLLING: It is wrong.PERINO: Juan, we have 40 seconds.WILLIAMS: Very quickly, Eric, you know my buddy here, loves to do nothing but talk about the good deeds of police officers, as if of course, they do nothing but good things.Today I want to join Eric, though, in saluting one cop who has done an astounding job for her community, Cathy Lanier, police chief of D.C., retiring after nine years as police chief. Twenty-six years since she became a beat cop. Under her tenure, violence is down, and the city can brag about good relations between the police and community. Here you see here at the Nationals game yesterday with some of the people she helped out, including a young man who was shot in the head.PERINO: All right.WILLIAMS: She's the kind of officer who uses her smile more than a gun.PERINO: All right. ""Special Report"" is next. Thanks for joining us. We'll see you tomorrow.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN HOLDREN, WHITE HOUSE SCIENCE ADVISER: The single most important bottom line that shines through all these hundreds of pages is that climate change is not a distant threat. It is something that is happening now. It is affecting the American people now in important ways.MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: The president also knows that much of the pain of imposing such regulations would be borne by our own middle class. That's why this discussion has become so cynical, and it's part of the reasons the president's own party couldn't even pass a national energy tax when it had complete control of Washington's Congress back in 2009 and 2010. The American people weren't willing to go along with considerable domestic pain for negligible global gain back then. It's foolish to think they'd assent to a bad idea now.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: An 800-page report released by the White House today. The president talking to local and national weather forecasters to stress the urgency of dealing with climate change. And there you see the pushback from the Senate Minority Leader on the floor.Let's bring in our panel, syndicated columnist George Will, Mara Liasson, National Political Correspondent of National Public Radio, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: What they tell you is that you should be scared about what's happening today. Of course, if it's very cold in the winter, they blame it, here in the northeast, they blame it on global warming, and the report says that global warming makes summers hotter and winters are generally shorter and warmer. Any scientific theory that explains everything explains nothing, and no matters what happens in climate is unpleasant, the word for that is weather, it's attributed to global warming. If we continue global warming up here in the northeast we're going to freeze to death.But the most important element is what McConnell was talking about, the negligible gains. Assume they are right about global warming, assume that it is all caused by man. The United States has reduced carbon emissions since 2006 more than any other country on earth. We are right now at 1992 levels according to the International Energy Agency, and yet carbon emissions have gone up globally. Why? We don't control the emissions of the other 96 percent of humanity, especially China and India.  As we dismantle the coal plants in our country, China and India together are adding one coal fired plant every week. The net effect is to shift the U.S. coal energy generating industry from here to India and China. It will have zero effect.If we could have a pact with other countries in which everybody would reduce their emissions, I would sign on. In the absence of it, all that we're doing is committing economic suicide in the name of do-goodism that will not do an iota of good.BAIER: Mara?MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Well, first of all, it's not clear, as Mitch McConnell suggested, that President Obama wants to put on a national energy tax. I don't think he's proposing that. But he is going to propose a new set of regulations. The EPA is going to come out with that.BAIER: Is the first part of the statement accurate, though? Obviously, he controlled both --LIASSON: Yes. He certainly couldn't do it back then, and he's not suggesting it now, though. But yes, he couldn't do it back then, and cap and trade went nowhere even though some Republicans were for it, including John McCain at one point.But I think the Republicans have to decide whether they want to say this isn't a problem or it is a problem but we shouldn't do anything unless China and developing countries are also on board. Eventually, this problem has to be dealt with. I think the science is pretty overwhelming now. It is real. It's climate change. It's not just global warming. It's extreme weather all over the place. And it is costing a lot of money and making a lot of changes. And we have to decide whether we're going to mitigate it or try to just adapt to it and live with it.BAIER: George?BAIER: There is, however, no evidence for the increase in extreme weather. I own a home on an island in South Carolina looking south in the direction of hurricanes, and after Katrina I was really interested when they said this is a harbinger of increased hurricane activity, which since then has plummeted. Now, Mr. Holdren, who introduced this report, has his own record of very interesting failed forecasts, not to mention Al Gore, who in 2008 said by 2013, for those of you keeping score at home that's last year, the ice cap in the North Pole would be gone. It's not.Now, there is, as Charles says, the policy question is how much wealth do we want to spend directly or in lost production in order to have no discernible measurable effect on the climate? People say well, what about this report? There is a sociology of science. Scientists are not saints in white laboratory smocks. They have got interests like everybody else. If you want a tenure track position in academia, don't question the reigning orthodoxy on climate change. If you want money from the biggest source of direct research in this country, the federal government, don't question it's orthodoxy. If you want to get along with your peers, conform to peer pressure. This is what's happening.BAIER: So you don't buy that 97 percent of scientists who studied the issue --WILL: Who measured it? Where did that figure come from? They pluck these things from the ether. I do not. The New Yorker magazine, which is impeccably upset about climate change, recently spoke about the report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as ""the last word on climate change."" Now, try that phrase, ""the last word on microbiology, quantum mechanics, physics, chemistry."" Since when does science come to the end?  The New Yorker has discovered the end of this. Who else has?BAIER: The climate assessment today said this, ""Americans,"" as Charles referenced, ""Americans are noticing changes all around them. Summers are longer and hotter, winters are generally shorter and warmer."" Now, this White House put out a statement just a week and a half ago, last week, saying about the GDP, the first quarter of 2014 was marked by unusually severe winter weather including record cold temperatures and snowstorms which explains part of the difference in the GDP growth relative to previous quarters."" Jay Carney was asked about all of this. Here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The impacts of climate change on weather are severe in both directions. The fact that the severe winter that much of the country endured had an impact on GDP it wasn't an assessment that we here alone made, but economists independent on the outside made and that nobody disagrees with.The fact is that no single weather event can be attributed to climate change. There is an inclination upon some to doubt the science despite the overwhelming evidence and the overwhelming percentage in the 97 percent range of scientists who study this issue who agree that climate change is real and that it is the result of human activity.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Charles?KRAUTHAMMER: 99 percent of physicists convinced that space and time were fixed until Einstein working in a patent office wrote a paper in which he showed that they are not. I'm not impressed by numbers. I'm not impressed by consensus. When I was a psychiatrist I participated in consensus conferences on how to define depression and mania. These are things that people negotiate in the way you would negotiate a bill, because the science is unstable, because in the case of climate the models are changeable and because climate is so complicated.The idea that we who have trouble forecasting what's going to happen on Saturday in the climate could pretend to be predicting what's going to happen in 30, 40 years, is absurd. And you always see that no matter what happens, whether it's a flood or it's a drought, whether it's one -- it's warming or cooling, it's always a result of what is ultimately what we're talking about here, human sin with the pollution of carbon. It's the oldest superstition around. It was in the Old Testament. It's in the rain dance of the Native Americans. If you sin, the skies will not cooperate.  This is quite superstitious, and I'm waiting for science which doesn't declare itself definitive but is otherwise convincing.BAIER: OK, Mara, let's talk about the politics of this. Clearly, it fits into the White House push, but what about 2014, 2016?LIASSON: I think that what would be the best politics perhaps would be to go ahead and push this. He's been doing this for years, and approve the Keystone pipeline. You know, in the past, the White House has believed that the Keystone pipeline was a side show. It doesn't affect global warming. There are a lot of Democrats, a good handful of red state incumbents would like the Keystone pipeline to be approved, and then he can focus on what he thinks is really important, which is this bigger climate change.BAIER: There are a few things they think are side shows. George?WILL: A moment ago we had a report here on our crumbling infrastructure, gave it a D, emergency. Who wrote it? As we said on there it was written by civil engineers, who said, by golly, we need more of what civil engineers do and are paid to do. Again, there is a sociology of science, there is a sociology in all of this, and engaging the politics of this, we have to understand the enormous interests now invested in climate change.LIASSON: On both sides.WILL: Sure.LIASSON: The fossil fuel industry has a big interest and you say environmentalists have an interest.WILL: It pales in comparison to the money flowing from the federal government.BAIER: Next up, violence heats up again in Eastern Ukraine as the policy debate heats up on Capitol Hill.
