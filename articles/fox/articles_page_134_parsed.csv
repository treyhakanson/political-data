This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Former President Bill Clinton talking back -- walking back something he said yesterday about extending all of the Bush tax cuts, at least temporarily.  That is his answer today. We're back with the panel. Charles? CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I think a concise way to summarize that is it depends what ""is"" is. I mean I write for a living and I've edited in my day and I edited lousy copy, but I can't make heads or tails of this. It's really un-editable. In fact, in psychology there is a term if you get a raving lunatic, excuse me, psychotic who comes in the door and makes no sense, you say he is speaking in the world salad. This is world salad with vinaigrette on it. He is apparently trying to walk back this idea he contradicted Obama on extension of the Bush tax cuts. He knows he did. He is not changing his position that I can understand, but he is basically saying I'm sorry. I don't think it washes. And I think you could sort of look at him and you know that he is saying -- essentially he is doing with a wink and a nod I'm under duress. Don't pay any attention to what I am saying. BAIER: Kirsten, this comes as new polls are out, Fox News polls out today. If the vote for president were held today it breaks down like this -- tied 43 percent 43 percent, there you see the difference between May and now, according to our polling. It is plus or minus three percent. Then you look at the independents, and it's Mitt Romney 38 percent, Barack Obama 34 percent. Your take on these polls? KIRSTEN POWERS, COLUMNIST, NEW YORK POST: This is what I would have predicted would have happen, that it would tighten up this way. It's interesting that Mark Halperin of Time magazine had a story out today saying that Democrats are now concerned that Obama could possibly lose, which was always obvious that he could potentially lose. But for some reason all these people in Obamaland and the Democrats were living -- I don't know -- in some other bubble where they didn't realize that this was going to be a really tight race, and I think they're starting to realize that and a poll like this is going to just reinforce that. The good news in the poll for Obama, and I'm not saying this is amazing news, it was 55 percent in April of 2010 thought we were in a recession, versus 41 percent now. He needs that trajectory. To be that at least people feel that we are no longer in a recession. They think we are in a downturn now, so it's a slight improvement. BAIER: Only by one percent though, put up a number five if you could. The poll that Kirsten is talking about is that 41 percent say they are in a recession, 42 percent say downturn, 15 percent say doing OK. POWERS: But it's down from April --BAIER: From where it was.POWERS: Yeah. BAIER: Bill? BILL KRISTOL, EDITOR, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: I would love the be a fly on the wall on November 6, on election day in the voting booth in Westchester Country, New York, where Bill Clinton votes. Because I would like to see who Bill Clinton is really going to vote for in this election. And I think Bill Clinton will vote for Mitt Romney. BAIER: You do? KRISTOL: Yes. Well, A, he probably thinks Romney would be a better president. Because Clinton at the end of a day is a grownup who did have a reasonably good economic record, and knows that Barack Obama is clueless about the economy, B, President Clinton is justly proud of the fact that he took the Democratic Party to the center, he rescued the Democratic Party from its failures of preceding decades, the Dukakis-Mondale party, and Obama has taken it back there. And he has done so while dissing Bill Clinton continually. I mean it is really startling. You can listen to Barack Obama give speeches for months. The last 30 years of American history have been terrible, right wing, income inequality, just all these failures. And Bill Clinton must be listening to those speeches and say, hey, I was president for eight of those years. But the way -- in Obama's mind it's sort of Reagan, Bush, parenthesis, (Clinton), Bush, bad years, I'm the savior. And I think Bill Clinton does not really appreciate that point of view from Barack Obama. BAIER: So when he says in response to questions about that, that is nuts, and then he says if Mitt Romney was president it would be calamitous, you just don't buy all that? KRISTOL: It's shocking Bret that I don't entirely believe that Bill Clinton is being 100 percent candid 100 percent of the time. BAIER: I do want to mention that the Fed chair Ben Bernanke was up on Capitol Hill today said that the crisis in Europe, Charles, has affected the U.S. economy dramatically and is calling on European policymakers to take a number of actions. How do you think that all fits into the picture of the U.S. economy? KRAUTHAMMER: I think it helps to explain why there is worry or concern or panic in Chicago in the Obama campaign. It isn't only the failure of the roll out of the campaign effect that Romney is doing well unopposed. They understand they are completely hostage to Europe. They can't do a thing about it. And the reason that the markets have dropped except for yesterday, but a dramatic drop, almost all of the gains of this year given back, is because whereas people thought they were around they had turned a corner on the Europe earlier in the year. It looks as if it is in bad shape, with the banks in Spain on the brink. Greece going to have an election that may have them leave the Eurozone. If all of this happened, and it's far more likely today meaning the collapse in Europe than would have been six months ago, it certainly is going to hurt the U.S. economy and it will hurt it early enough to effect the election. And they know that there is nothing this administration can do, any administration. It's really out of our hands. BAIER: Even pressuring Germany to act more than it is. KRAUTHAMMER: I don't think Germany is going to respond to our pressure. What exactly is our leverage? Are we an exemplar to say look how well we did so you are to do what we did? Germany is one of the success stories. It's not going to jump off a cliff because it hears a President of the United States say I need you to help my re-election. That's not going to work. BAIER: That is it for panel. But stay tuned to see why it's important to get briefed on what you are reporting.Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

4	4	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2012/06/04/friday-lightning-round-health-care-politics/	Friday Lightning Round: Health care politics	"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" June 1, 2012. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Every week viewers vote for your choice online in this, our Friday Lightning Round. This week the big winner, health care won with 33 percent of the vote. This of course comes as we are waiting for the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on the health care challenge. And we learned a little bit more up on Capitol Hill this week, as well. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN, R - TENNESSEE: The White House was over here working with Pharma, trying to construct this language. The White House was not going to let special interests influence any of this. But yet you've got an organization that is out here basically writing the health care bill. (END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Republicans are point to go e-mails released that came out this week that said that the administration was doing, as was suspected, some dealing with the pharmaceutical companies before the health care bill was put together. What about all of this and how it factors in in the big picture? Steve, it doesn't seem like health care overall, the law, has been very popular according to the polls, depending on how you ask the question. STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: It hasn't been. I would say, those E-mails had the potential had they gotten more coverage too have been quite damaging. But people have sort of moved beyond the construction of the health care bill and they're now, everybody is waiting for the Supreme Court decision and a potential debate about where this goes if the court upholds the mandate. BAIER: But the e-mails do kind of shatter the whole transparency talk from the administration about anything that was happening in the construction of that bill? RICK KLEIN, SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER, ABC NEWS: I this it was pretty well shattered and has been for a while. The bill itself, in part was so unpopular because those negotiations weren't televised on C-Span and the cornhusker kickback and on all of that. And now the court is gonna jump in the middle of this and have a decision later this month that is potentially going to upend all of the politics we're talking around this. Interestingly, talk to some Democrats, there are some who quietly aren't that scared of the prospect of this being thrown out, the idea of removing this albatross from them going into the fall, taking away this big issue and giving them something to motivate their voters out there -- the politics of this may already be settled, even though it's going to very much change the equation to have the signature accomplishment of President Obama's first term potentially thrown out.BAIER: Charles? CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, that's a three-cushion shot interpretation of what would happen if the court overturned it, which I've entertained because it's so interesting and perverse.But I think in the end it's gonna be a straight shot. If it's overturned it's gonna be a huge setback for the president. His signature achievement, he spent a year and a half on instead of working on the economy. And the idea that this professor of constitutional law got it so wrong, he and the Democratic leadership, that they weren't even aware of the constitutional issues, in the most important thing he did in the Congress, I think psychologically it will be devastatingBAIER: But to Rick's point, for moderate Democrats especially, it may be a bit of a relief not to have to defend the health care -- KRAUTHAMMER: In their Congressional races, yes. But for the president who is so closely linked with this, I think it's a net loss and it's a big loss. BAIER: OK, the next topic is this cyber warfare that a big article again in the New York Times talking about how President Obama secretly ordered the increase of sophisticated attacks on computer systems in Iran, including the Stuxnet virus we've heard a lot about. There's been some angst about this story and others in recent days. Steve, intel officials -- not happy about all this. HAYES: No, it's very interesting. I started the morning with some responses that I was getting from intel people, national security people who are concerned about the leaks and the fact that this was laid out on the pages of the New York Times, and that increased as the day went on. And I finally talked to a couple of very senior former intelligence officials who said David Petraeus needs to do a crimes report on this and start an investigation into the leak. The bigger problem I think from some of these people as one person said it appears to professionals that the information that they have been sworn to protect is being used for political purposes by the White House. That's a problem in the intelligence community.BAIER: Rick? KLEIN: Interesting and you played a little bit earlier in the show something that Leon Panetta said about cyber warfare and the idea that it actually wouldn't be warfare. The implication here is that we may be at war with Iran over what's going on. It's stunning, and it's a stunning revelation. And it comes, as you mentioned, we are learning more about -- about the president and how aggressive he's been in some of the national security areas. And I think this is just -- it's a really fascinating development with a lot of potential tentacles. And it gets us into some hot water potentially. The idea, the concept of a retaliation would very much need to be on the table. KRAUTHAMMER: It's beyond a problem, it's a scandal. Leaking the details that we saw in that plan about a very, very highly secret operation, the name of the operation, how it worked, when it worked, how it leaked out, the fact that we had Israeli cooperation, the name of the secret Israeli unit. All that was missing were the Hebrew names of the Israeli agents and their street addresses in Jerusalem. You wonder how an administration could do this, could allow all of these secrets out and jeopardize what we have done simply as a way to boost the president in an election year. I think it is a scandal. BAIER: Down the road, Democrats worried about Charlotte, North Carolina, being the convention site? KRAUTHAMMER: It's going to be embarrassing. KLEIN: Yes, but they can't do anything about it. They chose it for their political reasons and they're stuck for it. HAYES: But they just allowed sales for booze on Sunday which alleviates one problem. (LAUGHTER)BAIER: That's it for the panel. But stay tuned for something all realtors emphasize -- location, location, location.    Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
