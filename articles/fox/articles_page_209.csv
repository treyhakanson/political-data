'Special Report' Panel on Republican Presidential Politics and Fred Thompson's Timing

"	"This is a rush transcript of ""Special Report With Brit Hume"" from September 4, 2007. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, R-ARIZ.: Come on in, the water's fine. As you know, he and I have been good friends for many years, and I welcome him to the race.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRIT HUME, HOST: A bit of grace there from John McCain, who, like all the other Republican presidential candidates, may be wondering whether this business of getting in early is overrated what with Fred Thompson, who is not going to be in until later this week, will not be in Wednesday night's debate, doing very well indeed.Some thoughts on all this now from Fred Barnes, the executive editor of The Weekly Standard, Nina Easton, Washington bureau chief of Fortune Magazine, and Mort Kondracke, executive editor of Roll Call -- FOX News contributors all.Let's take a look at a couple of polls. These are averages composed by the Web site Real Clear Politics of a whole bunch of polls, and the national poll shows Rudy Giuliani in the lead with 28 percent. But look who is second -- Fred Thompson, 16 percent, ahead of Mitt Romney and John McCain, both.And the picture is a little different in the three major states, Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, where the picture is -- where you'll see that Mitt Romney is leading in two of those states, Rudy Giuliani is second, but there is Fred Thompson in third place, doing very nicely, especially in South Carolina, where he is a at 20 percent.So what to make of this, what to make of the fact that while all these other candidates, eight of them will be debating here on Wednesday night. Fred Thompson will be taking an ad that runs right before the debate and then appearing later that night on ""The Tonight Show.""Some in New Hampshire are saying that is a snub. Is that a snub or a smart move -- Fred?FRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Thompson will have a bigger audience, that's for sure, then a presidential debate during the primaries. Look, everything up to now was the preseason. Now the season begins. And Fred Thompson was always going to have to do well when the season began. These are the three months leading up to the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary, and everything else that is going on in those first months.So Fred Thompson did not hurt himself. And the other candidates may have helped themselves a little, but the way I see the race now, it is a three-way tie among Rudy Giuliani, Mitt Romney, and Fred Thompson. Then, somewhere, a little behind you have John McCain, and then somewhere back there is Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, and I'm not sure where the others are.But Fred Thompson is going to have to shine. But he was always going to have to shine, so staying out didn't hurt him.MORT KONDRACKE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, ROLL CALL: I think he has missed an opportunity. He has to going to have to mix it up with these other opponents at some point. And why he is ducking this one, it's not clear.There's more evidence of disorganization in the Thompson campaign than there is big-time strategy. He was going to announce around July 4, and it was going to be before Labor Day. He was going to participate in this debate, now he's not participating in this debate.There have been people quitting his campaign. His performances on the stump haven't been all that great. His fund-raising hasn't been that great.So he is going to get a bump from Jay Leno, but he has got to come into this thing. The time is short. He's got time to do this, but he is going to have to have a fast start. And we'll see whether he has a fast start or not, but the lead up has not been great.NINA EASTON, WASHINGTON BUREUA CHIEF OF FORTUNE MAGAZINE: He doesn't have time to stumble out of the block. And I think he is an actor. He likes scripts. He is entering in a very scripted way, which prevents him from stumbling immediately.As Mort said, he's had a lot of problems in the campaign. He didn't raise the money that he thought he was going to raise. Now he does have this southern strategy, apparently, where he's hoping to show well in Tennessee and Florida.But can he really, at this late date, be up and are ready for the big states this time around? California, New York, and so on? That is just a logistical issue.And McCain, over the course of the summer, we saw how much trouble he had both when you're mixing it up over issues, i.e., immigration, and running a campaign. These are big, big, seminal points in a campaign, and he is jumping in pretty late to be tackling...BARNES: This is what the preseason is about.Mort says there's disorganization, and, obviously, there was disorganization. And that's what you get rid of during the preseason, and you hope you are better honed.Look, we're going to have a very early verdict on Fred Thompson, it will be by the end of this week. He will have the 30 second ad. He will be on Jay Leno. He will go to Iowa on Thursday and make his formal announcement, and then he'll have a few speeches leading up to the weekend.And we are going to know very early if he hit the ground running or not.KONDRACKE: In the lead up to the debate tomorrow night, there was one other interesting thing that happened, and that was Romney's appeared yesterday, here in Durham, actually, he was asked about the Iraq war, and he said it is a mess.And he has adopted what sounded very like the Iraq Study Group's strategy, that we are going to start withdrawing troops, we are going to move to a place outside Iraq, but we're going to be available in case we have to respond to an emergency, or something like that.It sounds as though -- he is pursuing...HUME: Do you think he'll emerge as the antiwar candidate?KONDRACKE: He is the doviest of the major candidates, and I think that reflects his timing strategy. He is an Iowa and New Hampshire first kind of guy. Iowa is notoriously, even though it's the Hawkeye state, it's not a super hawk state, and people there tend to be less interventionist than other places. New Hampshire a little bit less so.HUME: Well, he's not the only one talking about the possibility of troop withdrawal. The president is as well. Congress is back at work, and preparing for a showdown with the president on Iraq. So we will get to that subject next. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: If the kind of success we are now seeing continues, it will be possible to maintain the same level of security with fewer American forces.SEN HARRY REID, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER, D-NEV.: We will soon hear, as I have indicated, from the president and his generals. But we know already that political progress has failed.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUME: Well, there you have two views. The president says things are going so well in Iraq that if it continues, he will be prepared to withdraw some troops. And then you hear Harry Reid say that the political progress, which he and other Democratic critics of the war have made their principle subject here, has failed.So what about all? And what about what the president said yesterday -- Nina?EASTON: Well, this is shaping up, I think, going into the delivery of the Petraeus report next week, this is shaping up as the Iraq war's political football by both sides. And I think it's once again going to attribute to the 18 percent approval rating of Congress and 30 percent approval rating of the president.What you've got is the Petraeus report, which is largely based on benchmarks about the central government. And that's what the Democrats are going to latch onto -- the political part of it.And the GAO, the research arm of Congress, came out with a report saying that look, that these benchmarks haven't been met. Now, the White House disputes a couple of those key issues, but those reports are based on how things are going in central Baghdad.The progress that has been seen, and is sort of a surprise, is on the ground, as we know. Sunni sheikhs are involved with troops. They have turned against al-Qaeda. So the White House is seizing on that to show that, yes, there's progress, but don't pull the rug out from under us.But this is the time there should be serious consideration -- you are hearing it from Democrats as well -- serious consideration about how to not leave this country irresponsibly. And if Harry Reid is going to get out there and turn this into a political football and the White House responds in kind, I just think you're going to see more disgust on the part of the American public.KONDRACKE: The center of gravity in Washington in this conflict is Republicans, moderate Republicans. Will they break from the president?And I think that because of the progress that the surge has shown on the military front in Anbar and Diyala, and also in terms of suppressing civilian casualties, and so on, and in addition, the president's promise that if this all plays out well, he will begin withdrawing troops on his own, that the Republicans are going to hold.And, therefore, the Democrats, when they attempt to cut off funds or impose the deadline, it is not going to work anymore than it worked last year.On the other hand, the picture is mixed, not only on the national reconciliation front, but even on the local reconciliation front -- supposed bottom up reconciliation. It's reconciliation by the Sunnis with us, possibly temporarily. It's not Sunnis and Shiites living together and learning how to cooperate and stuff like that.So there's still a lot of sectarian violence going on. There's still a lot of sectarian animosity. So if and when we withdraw, that's the crucial time. That's when the civil war might break out again.BARNES: Mort is wrong about the Sunnis. Look at what has happened among the Sunnis. And this is the most important that has happened in Iraq all year, and the GAO report doesn't deal with it at all.And it happened not only in Anbar, where the president went, now probably the safest place in Iraq, it has been Diyala provinces, it's been the provinces in the so called ""Triangle of Death"" south of Baghdad, and some others, where it's moving very rapidly, this bottom-up reconciliation.HUME: What Mort was saying that it was with the Sunnis, but not so much with the Shia.BARNES: Mort's point was that the Sunnis are not joining the coalition or the Iraqi government. Now you would be worried if these Sunnis, who are now fighting the insurgency, and are fighting and, really, defeating Al Qaeda, were just forming militias and doing that.They are joining the Iraqi National Army in units with Shia soldiers as well. And they're joining the Iraqi National Police Force. So they're signing up for Iraq. They're not signing up to be a separatist movement among Sunnis.Now, look, one of the things about the GAO report, it says in the report there is no clear evidence there has been any reduction in sectarian violence, none, because we can't tell what the perpetrators really were thinking when they did it.When somebody drives a truck bomb into a Shia neighborhood and it blows up, it is probably sectarian violence. And it is way down.Content and Programming Copyright 2007 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Transcription Copyright 2007 Voxant, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE BILL MCCOLLUM, R-FLA.: I am t he Ronald Reagan conservative in the race. I have a proven record I'm proud of, and they need to weigh my record, me conservative record against Rick Scott's scandals. GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE RICK SCOTT, R-FLA.: My opponent's a career politician. My opponent has voted for tax increases 42 times. He has never created a private sector job. All I've ever done is build businesses.SENATE CANDIDATE REP. KENDRICK MEEK, D-FLA.: Over 50 plus mayors in this state have endorsed my candidacy. That meant something in the final analysis, because when you are fighting against $26 million, you have to have third party validaters, and we have quite a few of them here in Florida. SENATE CANDIDATE JEFF GREENE, D-FLA.: I'm the only guy in this race that's created a jobs his whole life, who understands the complex issues facing our economy and will put Floridians back to work. (END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, HOST: Sights and sounds from Florida, really where the national focus is tonight, a primary night for five states.Lets' bring our panel about the politics here, Jonah Goldberg, at-large editor of National Review online, Juan Williams, news analyst for National Public Radio, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer.Jonah, let's start in Florida with that gubernatorial GOP primary which it appears had closed. It might be the tightest tonight. What about that race? JONAH GOLDBERG, AT-LARGE EDITOR, NATIONAL REVIEW ONLINE: First of all, the whole state is so chaotic politically that it should probably be put in receivership for a decade or so. I think one of the interesting stories that we're going to hear out of this is, one of the claims is that the Tea Partiers have lost their oomph, that this is the, as Carl Cameron was saying, this is the insiders sort of coming back. I think there is some truth to that. But I also think one of the things we see in this is how the institutional GOP has learned its lessons from the Tea Parties and from the political mood out there. We'll see it when we talk about McCain as well. I think McCollum when he came out with the tougher than Arizona's immigration law, when he started to position himself as sort of a Tea Party, more Tea Party-ish guy, he was able to cut off Rick Scott. I also think one of the other things we're seeing here is that crazy vanity billionaire campaigns aren't as popular as maybe they once were in age of Perot. BAIER: Another big money candidate, Jeff Greene in the Democratic Senate primary, Juan, against Kendrick Meek, the congressman, what about that race and what it says more broadly? JUAN WILLIAMS, NEWS ANALYST, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: It's an interesting race, because Jeff Greene came in as challenging Kendrick Meek as the insider. Kendrick Meek was seen as the incumbent, the establishment candidate for the Democrats. He has the endorsement of President Obama and President Clinton. His mother, of course, was a congresswoman from Florida. But what has happened is that all of a sudden all the money that Jeff Greene has invested, and he has put a ton of his own money, multi- million dollars into the race, has come back to bite him a little bit. Controversies about his yacht, his trips to Cuba, and the like. And the consequence of that is he has become somewhat scandal tainted. It is still a fairly close race but it looks like it's Meeks to lose at this point. BAIER: An interesting part of the race is how it shaped up in the general election versus the independent Governor Charlie Crist and the Republican Marco Rubio and how it will all shake out. We'll have results tonight. Now Charles, we're talking more broadly about the races, if there is a generic theme in some of the primaries.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: One of them that I think everybody is always interested is the Palin effect. And one of the memes today is that it's sort of faded. Since the middle of June, the candidates she has backed have lost I think 10 out of 13. But I think that is not the way to judge her endorsement. There's really two types of endorsement, one to get a sage wise man that says to the electorate you can trust this person and you're OK, the way Nixon sought Eisenhower -- he desperately sought Eisenhower's endorsement in 1960. In that sense, the endorsement is the closure, it closes a deal.The Palin effect is not that. Her effect is to energize some of the electorate to look at somebody they've never heard of. She is a starter kit. She helped Nikki Haley in South Carolina. You're unknown and you get the Palin effect. And then it's your game. You win it or lose it on your own. I think her effect in Alaska, I think her candidate Joe Miller is going to lose against Lisa Murkowski, but --BAIER: The incumbent senator from Alaska. KRAUTHAMMER: Right. And we probably are not going to hear Miller after tomorrow, but we never would have heard about him today if he hadn't had her endorsement. So she has an interesting effect of being a sort of jump- starter. But after that, you're on your own. BAIER: Jonah, you mentioned the McCain-Hayworth race in Arizona. John McCain, who was obviously a big proponent of campaign finance reform, has poured $21 million into this primary race. He too had the endorsement of Sarah Palin, his running mate, obviously, on the GOP ticket. What about the race tonight? GOLDBERG: I think that is another example of, you know, without re-litigating the '08 election, McCain has proven he can read the political climate much better than the guy who won the presidential contest in 2008. Remember, it was a year ago that Barack Obama told Arkansas Congressman Marion Berry that the difference between the 2010 elections and 1994 is you will have me and that's going to make all the difference in the world. And it looks like things might actually be worse than 1994 because of Obama and because of the Obama administration or the Democrats' misreading of the political climate. Meanwhile, John McCain managed to eviscerate J.D. Hayworth and also sop in the sort of anti-Washington mood in this country and the state in a way that very few people might have predicted six months ago. BAIER: Juan, we talk about the economy all the time, and that will be the key issue heading to the mid-terms. Today, House Minority Leader John Boehner gave a big speech ripping on the administration. Vice President Biden responded directly to Boehner. What about this back and forth over stimulus and whether it's effective or not and how it will play in November? WILLIAMS: I think that right now if you look at the polls, stimulus is not very popular. Some of the calculations we've seen indicate there is still stimulus money to be spent, which then begs the question given that we have high unemployment, ten percent, why is the money not being spent to generate some more jobs in the country? So there's a lot of controversy about it. It's hard to see it as a positive selling point for Democrats. The negative, and what Boehner was saying today is, you know what, we need more tax cuts and we got to invest more tax cuts that he says would benefit the small business in this country and people who do hiring. What you're hearing from Vice President Biden is, wait a second -- the administration is still saying we give tax cuts to everybody who is under $250,000 is really tax benefits that go to the very rich. Most small business is not going to benefit from it. While some say today Boehner is measuring the drapes to take over the Speaker of the House, what you are hearing from the vice president is he is in love with the policies of the Bush administration and suddenly we're back to blaming the economic situation on the previous administration. BAIER: Quickly, Charles, Vice President Biden has also cited the Congressional Budget Office saying that the stimulus really did save 3.3 million Americans' jobs and the unemployment rate would have been 1.8 percent lower, and it's impossible for critics to refute that. KRAUTHAMMER: If you put out a number like that, you can't refute that because it's angels on the head of a pin. It's a fictional number. A real number is what we got on housing today, a collapse of the market. The lowest sales of preexisting homes in 15 years, which shows that all of the stimulus Obama had put in to it with that credit was simply a time shifter. It was a prop under a weak economy that as soon as you took it out collapsed.Which means, as the rest of the stimulus, it had no enduring effect, and that's what everybody understands. If you put that effect against the Biden fictional number about the jobs saved or created, and it trumps it. BAIER: You're also saying the CBO numbers is fictional? KRAUTHAMMER: Well, the CBO will tell you a number, and then you look at the market and you see the prices on housing, none of them are moving. That's not a fictional number. That is a real number and its a real effect. BAIER: What do you think? Are the most important economic numbers out right now? Log on to our home page at FoxNews.com/SpecialReport and vote in our online poll. Up next, racial politics, big taxpayer money and the Agriculture Department. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)TOM VILSACK, AGRICULTURE SECRETARY: I think it's fair to say that we both feel it's appropriate and necessary for the Senate to take action as quickly as possible to make sure that the appropriations for those cases are made and that we get the cases settled as quickly as possible. REP. STEVE KING, R-IOWA: So it comes to altogether about 92,000 people who claim they were discriminated against by the USDA, and when we only had 18,000 black farmers. The highest number we can produce to go back to the '70s is about 27,000 black farmers. (END VIDEO CLIPS)BAIER: This is all about claims of a North Carolina farmer, Timothy Pickford's class action lawsuit in 1997. That is what they are talking about. Black farmers he alleged were denied agriculture loans and the racial discrimination cases ignored by the Agriculture Department. Here are the payments so far, according to authorities. Pickford I, which is the first settlement, a little more than $1 billion. Now the Obama administration reopened the case last year and if authorized by Congress, we're talking another $1.25 billion. The number of claims, the first settlement turned out about 16,000 claims were approved, about 7,000 of them were thrown out.Pickford II, we are talking about 73,800 petitions, claims put in. The number of black farmers according to the census in 2007 had 32,000, a release by the National Black Farmers Association puts the number at 18,000 for the entire country in 2007. What about all of this? We're back with the panel. Juan, it seems like a big story about this settlement. WILLIAMS: I think it is an interesting story. It's an interesting in this way that if you said simply here are the number of black farmers in the country, 27,000 at max, during the '70s and '80s, and you look at the number of claims you, say this is far disparate. So how is it possible? I think it's possible in several ways. And I might add that Steve King has done an interesting job, he said he located most of the payments have gone to people in the cities, not in the rural areas of the South where most of the farms are previously located and where there are claims of discrimination.Obviously you could have eras, people who left the farming -- of course there was a great black migration in '30s and '40s and even subsequently people going to big cities in the north. So people who have been impacted may not directly be farmers any longer.But this is an interesting moment in that he is way out of line with most of the colleagues in the Congress who don't agree with him. The Congress has passed this, the Senate is waiting on this and waiting on this. So it's not over contention that there is too much feeding at the trough by people who are not eligible but something about Native Americans and payments to them. BAIER: In 2009, an arbiter, Jonah, awarded the Sherrods, Shirley Sherrod and her husband Charles, the largest settlement, $12 million for a cooperative farm that they were representing and had. What about all of this in the big picture? GOLDBERG: The really big picture here is first of all, I think this stinks to high heaven. I think it has more to do with sort of the Clinton-era Justice Department and the Clinton appointed judge setting off essentially what amounts to a plaintiff's bar racket. The idea that somehow 500 percent, 500 percent of all the black farmers, whoever existed in the 1980s, were all discriminated against, right, because that's the supposition here, is that not just a few black farmers, which I'm sure were discriminated against, but all of them and then multiply it times five, were discriminated against. It just doesn't pass the smell test. Moreover, we have people in America getting billions of dollars, white people getting billions of dollars who don't farm either. The entire Department of Agriculture is a scam and scandal. BAIER: King says he's going to investigate if they get the gavel, Charles. KRAUTHAMMER: I think he should, because the disparity of these numbers would be explicable if it had discrimination in the pre-civil rights era and you have heirs which would increase the number. But this is oddly discrimination that had to be between '81 and '96. BAIER: According to the settlement. KRAUTHAMMER: Exactly. So it makes it odd that you have 90,000 claimants when you have this small number of farmers. But I would add that you get this kind of abuse in a lot of class action suits you get it and asbestos, and you get it in Mesothelioma where you have the doctors who produce fake x-rays and lawyers who do that have gone to jail. So it isn't as if this is a racial issue. The class action systems opens itself to an enormous amounts of corruption. BAIER: Something tells me we will talk about this again.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN HILLARY CLINTON, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Campaigns are like life. Some days you're good, some days you got some challenges. You have to get up the next day and overcome them. That's how I live my life. That's how I run my campaign.And I feel really, really good about where my campaign is.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRIT HUME, HO ST: Indeed she may -- may Hillary Clinton feel good about it -- but it has not been, at least in terms of her standing in the polls in a couple of key early states, the best couple of weeks she could have had.Some thoughts on all this now from Fred Barnes, executive editor of The Weekly Standard, Nina Easton, Washington bureau chief of Fortune Magazine and the syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer -- FOX News contributors all.Nina, it doesn't appear yet that anything that she has tried has broken the momentum that Barack Obama has shown in the opinion polls.NINA EASTON, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, FORTUNE MAGAZINE: Let me quote Barack Obama, who just recently in the past couple of days said, look, last month I was an idiot, and this month I'm a genius.I think there's a lot of this like lemming running to proclaim that Hillary Clinton is in freefall. She has always been in trouble in Iowa, that always been the case. And it's clear that she peaked in Iowa -- HUME: You mean it's always been a difficult state for her?EASTON: It has always been a difficult state for her.She peaked in Iowa and nationally, actually, in early November, right after she stumbled that debate in Philadelphia, where she was asked the question about should you grant illegal immigrants driver's licenses, as New York state was proposing.She stumbled on that, and it was an opportunity for Barack Obama to look like a big guy. He stood up to her, tough, and it raised his stature. Since then, of course, there have been these attacks against him from the Clinton campaign that have backfired. Yes, she is stumbling. Yes, the trajectory is that she has turned it down and he has turned it up. I still think there's a chance for her in Iowa, even though her husband calls it a miracle, which by the way, I think -- HUME: He said he is not low balling!EASTON: I think this is, once again, Bill Clinton's spin. Keep in mind, Bill Clinton lost Iowa, came in second in New Hampshire in '92, and then he was suddenly the comeback kid. So this guy knows about spin.And I think it's still all in play, and we shouldn't be writing off Hillary Clinton.FRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, WEEKLY STANDARD: I agree: she's not dead yet. But she is certainly heading in the wrong direction. And she acts desperate. Her husband acts desperate. Going on Charlie Rose and saying that --HUME: It would be a miracle if she won?BARNES: Well, it would be a miracle if she won, and Obama just doesn't the experience, he hasn't been around long enough.I think the Clintons believe that it's their turn, and who is this guy Obama coming along and trying to butt in? Doesn't he know? His turn will come. We'll let him have the next turn. But Hillary Clinton, Senator Clinton, it's her turn now -- I think that's what they believe.But, look, she has a base in the Democratic Party, one that's been there a while, that was built up by her husband, and she's inherited a lot of it. I agree with Nina that it's not as great in Iowa as it is in other states like New Hampshire.And if she loses in Iowa and comes back and wins New Hampshire -- she will probably lose in South Carolina -- she will still be in the race, and it will be a horse race between her and Barack Obama.So, I agree, we shouldn't be burying her yet.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: And, for sure, there will be another cycle in the campaign coverage, which will be her comeback. It is inevitable, and if it doesn't happen, we're going to make it happen because the press will want a story.But I think there's a fundamental problem that she has that explains her fall, and that is we saw on the front page of ""The New York Times"" today. Her staff is talking about the big theme has to be change, change, change, and she is a change agent. She used the word a dozen times in all of her appearances this morning on the shows.But what everybody understand is if you elect her, what you are electing is a Clinton restoration. It's a return to the '90's. You are going to get the same couple, except now it is going to be officially two presidents, with all the complications of this odd and strained marriage.You're electing a marriage, and you're going to have all of the complications that we read about today, about the struggles within his people in the campaign, her people in the campaign. Imagine how that's going to be occurring over and over again if they are in the Oval Office.The advantage Obama has is he's offering a change and a future that is a clean slate, and hers is a return is to the '90s, and the slate is not very clean.EASTON: And her stance with experience, though versus Obama, and I don't see what the problem is with her raising questions about Obama's lack of experience. It is when they draw a contrast between the candidates -- BARNES: It is like they just got out of high school, and it is ridiculous.And, look, when Hillary Clinton talks about 35 years of experience, a lot of that experience is just as a spectator of politics. Her husband, remember, was the governor. Her husband was the president. She may have done things like the healthcare plan, which was a huge disaster, but the rest of the time, that's not real experience.I liken it to going to a football game. If I went to a football game and watched the game, and I came out of the game and said, I watch the game and I come out of the game and said, well, I'm experienced at football, and that's sort of what she is doing. Look -- HUME: You're suggesting that she has been a fan of politics but not a player?BARNES: She is a spectator -- she is sort of a player, with no responsibility.EASTON: A spectator is not a person that came up with a healthcare plan that she was wildly criticized for and had to deal with all the fallout.BARNES: She blew it, too. She talks about fighting for 35 years for all these things. Compare that to McCain when he says he was fighting.HUME: That's a good point.Here is quick update, but the way, on that grapevine item we did from the ""New York Sun"" story about the Princeton student who alleged he had been beaten after coming out against the school distribution of condoms.""The Daily Princetonian"" now says that Francisco Nava, that's the guy, has admitted he made up the story and fabricated ex-mails threatening his life and those of other student and one professor.Nava reportedly confessed to police today. He has been released with no charges so far. The school says the investigation continues.Next up with our panel, the proper role for religion and politics -- is there one? If so, what is it? We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BARAK OBAMA, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am so grateful to be here today, giving all praise and honor to god. Look at the day that the lord has made.MIKE HUCKABEE, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: At this time of year, sometimes it's nice to pull aside from all of that and just remember that what really matters is the celebration of the birth of Christ, and being with our family and our friends.I hope that you and your family will have a magnificent Christmas season. And on behalf of all of us, god bless, and merry Christmas.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUME: Well that message from Mike Huckabee, where he said have a wonderful Christmas season, but it also took note of that fact that this is the celebration of the birth of Christ. It was not exactly a non- denominational season's greeting card in the form of a campaign commercial.And, of course, what you heard from Barack Obama certainly brought his faith front and center before the audience to whom he was speaking, I guess, in South Carolina.Charles Krauthammer, who is at my side here, has written of this campaign ""It is knee deep in religion."" And he says it is only going to get worse, ""but a certain kind of conservative is not content,"" he went on, ""to argue that a religious underpinning for a policy is not disqualifying. He insists, does this conservative, that it is uniquely qualifying. Indeed, that it confers some special status.""Charles, we will come to you about all this in a moment, but, first, what about this, Fred? Barack Obama is a man of faith. Mike Huckabee is a man of faith who went so far with his faith as to become a minister. Is it fair to accuse him of running improperly on his faith?BARNES: I think Mike Huckabee is. And we have seen him in a different -- I wouldn't object that much to his Christmas card ad, but his earlier ad was the one that starts out by saying my faith defines me. And then he is a Christian leader. And that is clearly a pitch for a vote for me because I'm a Christian.I think, beyond that, there's not much. I know Charles complains about one line in Mitt Romney's speech about his Mormon faith, but beyond that -- I have been out with Romney. He doesn't campaign on his faith. Other candidates don't.HUME: You think Huckabee does?BARNES: I think he does. But, you see, Barack Obama, it was Sunday, and he was in South Carolina, and, so far as I know, and I haven't been out with Barack Obama, but he's not campaigning on his faith.Look, there is a difference between running on your faith, saying vote for me because I'm a Christian, and someone who just mentions his faith from time to time, as George W. Bush did in 2000.EASTON: There is nothing new about invoking god in presidential elections. The rise of the Christian right in the Republican Party is what it is. It's fine. It is like saying I'm gun owner. It is a way to identify and to pander to voters.Let's go back to 1988. You had Pat Robertson, a televangelist, come in second in Iowa. Flash forward to 2000, and you have George Bush naming Jesus Christ as his favorite philosopher.This is -- what's different is that the Democrats have decided they wrote off, in a very narrow election in 2000, they wrote off voters who were religious because of their secular speak, the way they talked to voters. And so now you see Barack Obama and Harry Reid, actually, in the Senate trying to appeal to those voters. That's the difference.KRAUTHAMMER: I agree it is not new. It is very old, but I think Huckabee did go over the line in that ad by saying that as a Christian leader he was appealing suddenly to the many evangelicals who believe that Mormons are not Christians, and perhaps they're heretical, and thus he is a superior candidate. That's what's wrong.I think it's time that all the candidates started rendering unto Caesar. It is completely harmless, that Christmas message from Huckabee. That's fine. Or the invocation by Obama in South Carolina. But there's an implication that there is something special about being a minister or Christian or a believer -- HUME: But if there were ever a candidate who, seems to me by the way he has lived his life, made it either inevitable or, at least, appropriate that he should talk about his faith even, indeed, campaigned from it, it would be Huckabee.KRAUTHAMMER: But he is implying that there is something special about that that makes him uniquely specially qualified to be president.We've got a war on terror. We have difficulties in the economy. We have immigration issues. Religion is not the key. Being a minister is not an answer on those issues.Content and Programming Copyright 2007 FOX News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Transcription Copyright 2007 Voxant, Inc.

"This is a partial transcript of ""Special Report With Brit Hume,"" October 5, 2005, that has been edited for clarity.Watch ""Special Report With Brit Hume"" weeknights at 6 p.m. ETBRIT HUME, HOST: It may not be coming soon to a theater near you, but there is a movie being made about that Texas county prosecutor, Ronnie Earle. Here is an excerpt from the still-unfinished film.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RONNIE EARLE, TEXAS DISTRICT ATTORNEY: Both the Democrats and the Republicans walk around corporate America, walk up and down corporate America's main street, with their hand out, asking, you know, or demanding -- it's almost like protection money. I mean, this is a problem for our country. It's every bit as insidious as terrorism.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUME: One journalist who has seen the completed parts of the film and has been looking into the matter is Byron York, White House correspondent of ""National Review,"" who joins me now.So, Byron, welcome. And what sort of a picture of Ronnie Earle -- first of all, what are the circumstances of this movie? And what kind of access did they have to him?BYRON YORK, ""NATIONAL REVIEW"": There were a couple of filmmakers in Texas who wanted to make a movie about this whole thing after the big redistricting fight in Texas a couple of years ago.HUME: Which is the result of the election in which these contributions were raised and ultimately spent?YORK: Exactly. And they asked Tom DeLay to cooperate. Tom DeLay declined. Ronnie Earle said, ""Yes."" And they followed him around for a couple of years and talked to him at great length, and also got some video inside the grand jury room.(CROSSTALK)HUME: While the grand jury was meeting?YORK: It was an empty grand jury room at the time, but you do see some staffers and a few grand jurors in the picture, as well.HUME: So it wasn't a quite an empty room?YORK: The filmmaker said that it was -- that they felt they had extraordinary access, but not to any secret grand jury material.HUME: All right. So how do these filmmakers come out on -- how do they portray Ronnie Earle? What can we glean about him from what you've seen?YORK: You know, I think the lesson you get from the picture -- obviously, Ronnie Earle has been accused of being a partisan Democrat.HUME: Well, he is a Democrat.YORK: And he is a Democrat. And, indeed, his two biggest targets have been Tom DeLay and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. He unsuccessfully tried to prosecute her a while back. His defenders say, well, of course, he has -- and it's true -- he has prosecuted a lot of Democrats.HUME: Yes, more Democrats, in fact, in total than Republicans.YORK: Exactly. And I think the thing you get in the film is that Ronnie Earle has a passion for the cause of ridding the American political system of the evils of corporate campaign contributions. Those are, by the way, illegal in 18 states in the United States, but not illegal in the other 32.HUME: Texas is one of the states where it's illegal.YORK: Exactly. It's one of the 18. He talks about how corporate money is the root of all evil and we just got to cut off the tap. And it actually was very consistent with a conversation I had with him several months ago.I had done a story -- he had actually indicted a few corporations in addition to some of DeLay's associates at the time. And he actually offered a number of them, to drop the charges, if they would contribute money to an educational project, to teach Americans about the evils of corporate money.And he said to me, ""I think this is just -- we need to have a national conversation about this."" So I think, when you look at the film, you get the sense of him seeing himself more as a crusader on this issue of corporate money than even perhaps as any sort of partisan.HUME: There is a statement attributed to him. I think you quoted it. The movie, I guess, is called ""The Big Buy.""YORK: That's correct.HUME: One can get an idea of what that's supposed to mean.But here's a statement that we have. He says, ""The root of the evil of the corporate and large-moneyed interests' domination in politics is money. This is in the Bible. This isn't rocket science. The root of all evil truly is money, especially in politics. People talk about how money is the mother's milk of politics. Well, it's the devil's brew. And what we've got to do, we've got to turn off the tap.""What about -- I mean, it is perfectly -- there's nothing wrong with somebody crusading on that issue. Many people honorably do it. Some would cite John McCain and Russ Feingold, authors of the McCain-Feingold reform bill as examples of that. Nothing wrong with that.What does this film show us or tell us, if anything, about whether he is meticulous and faithful to the law in pursuing this cause?YORK: Well, it does feature one critic of his who said that, you know, Ronnie -- you'll ask him about something...HUME: Who is this critic?YORK: It's a lawyer for the Texas Association of Business, which is a group that was investigated by Earle. And he said, you know, you'll ask Ronnie about something and he'll say it's wrong. And you'll say, ""But, Ronnie, where is that against the law?"" And he'll say, ""Well, it's wrong.""And so he suggests that there is kind of a different view of enforcing the law than just a strict, you know, black-and-white, letter-of-the-law interpretation.HUME: Well, based upon what one assumes, with DeLay not cooperating, and Earle giving extraordinary access, this film is not unfriendly to Ronnie Earle?YORK: Oh, not at all. It's a very friendly portrait of Ronnie Earle. And it is -- the producers bill it as a crime story. And the criminal in the case is clearly Tom DeLay. And the cop is Ronnie Earle. So it's a very favorable portrait of Earle.HUME: Based on what you know about Texas law, is there anything inappropriate that could cause trouble for Earle's prosecution of DeLay, based on the fact that all of this -- a lot of this stuff was being -- not the grand jury deliberations, but a lot of it was being filmed?YORK: I did not see anything in the film. But I should say that lawyers for DeLay's co-defendants have informed the filmmakers that they intend to seek a subpoena for all of the outtakes, to see what else may have been shot in the production of the movie.HUME: Oh, boy. Here we go.All right, Byron, thanks very much.Content and Programming Copyright 2005 Fox News Network, L.L.C. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Transcription Copyright 2005 eMediaMillWorks, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BARACK OBAMA, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We should sell 70 million barre ls of oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve for less expensive crude, which, in the past, has lowered gas prices within two weeks.(END VIDEO CLIP)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)I do not believe that we should use the Strategic Oil Reserves at this point.(END VIDEO CLIP)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)It does include a limited amount of new offshore drilling. And while I still don't believe that that's a particularly meaningful short- term or long-term solution, what I said is I'm willing to consider it if it's necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan.(END VIDEO CLIP)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)More drilling is just going to leave us in an oil deficit. And we're still going to be sending billions to foreign nations.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: There you see Senator Barack Obama today and Senator Barack Obama in a couple of different speeches over recent weeks about the energy issue. He gave a big speech about it today, as did John McCain.How about this issue and where it stands now? Some analytical observations from Fred Barnes, Executive Editor of The Weekly Standard, Mara Liasson, National Political Correspondent for National Public Radio, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer, FOX News contributors all. Fred, what is your take of the speech today and the back and forth?FRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Well, Barack Obama does change his mind, that's for sure--and in rather short order--on taking some oil out of the strategic reserves.Look, this windfall profits tax he is proposing is amazing on several grounds, because, one, I mean, it is really cheap political demagoguery. We're going to take money from the oil companies and we're going to give it to people--exactly the kind of politics that Obama has said over and over again he doesn't play. It is politics at its crassest possible form.And then, of course, it's bad economics and bad policy.Look, there's a simple--there's only one thing you have to understand about this windfall profits tax. When you tax something, you get less of it. When you subsidize it, you get more of it.I mean, this is why I suppose he voted for these tax breaks for the oil companies back in 2005--ones that McCain voted against, by the way-- and we got more. Now we will get less with this windfall profits tax.And his goals--the one that I found the most--most of these goals he set are literally fantastic--in other words, they're fantasies. But he says we'll eliminate the need for oil from the Middle East and Venezuela within ten years.Look, I've talked to a lot of people about this, where we can go, how much oil and gas we're going to need, and so on, and that's just not going to happen.BAIER: Mara, who is winning this debate?MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: I think up until now, the energy debate was kind of the silver lining for the Republicans in an otherwise gloomy economic debate where they were losing to the Democrats generically by 20 points, except for on this issue.Offshore drilling is popular, and it looked to people that they had a better energy proposal, which was to do more of everything--solar, alternatives, conservation, plus drilling and nuclear. And now I think...BAIER: Although John McCain says that, as well. He has says he is for all those alternatives.LIASSON: That's what I'm saying. Up until now, McCain has been winning on this argument.I think Obama was smart politically to kind of blunt the advantage that McCain had on drilling by saying as part of a compromise, I'm happy to do that. He's not a rigid ideological politician. He's willing to make a deal.I think the windfall profits tax--I agree with Fred. On that one it seems like a gimmick. It's symbolic. It is a populist measure.But he is the one who stood pretty firm against this ""gas tax holiday"" during the primaries with Hillary Clinton, and he really stuck to his principles on. It was a hokey, symbolic idea that would not bring down the price of gas. I think this is the same thing.BAIER: To release 70 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, most experts say it wouldn't bring down gas prices quickly, or that long, and wouldn't do too much for a long period of time. Is that different than the gas tax holiday in some way?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: The gas tax holiday was hokey and cheap, and this is hokier and cheaper, because to take from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is to jeopardize our national security. It really is for supply interruption, which would be a catastrophe for our country.To take stuff out is going to have negligible effect on price, it will have an effect for a day or two. The amount he wants to take out is about a week's worth of imports. It's absurd.And if you wanted to remove from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, at least you should be in favor of drilling so that, domestically, in a few years, we will have essentially new strategic reserves in the Arctic or offshore, which would substitute for draining the reserves we currently have.So his position is contradictory, cheap, and political.And the stuff he said only a week ago in Missouri on Wednesday of last week, if we only inflated our tires it would substitute for all the oil that the Republicans want to drill for is a towering absurdity.The amount we would save in our tires generously calculated is about 1/200 of what you get from offshore oil alone, and the amount of oil shale is in the West would give us 10,000 years worth of the gasoline saved by inflating our tires.The problem with the Democratic position is they always say 'let's do x' instead of drilling. What the American people understand is you do x, y, and z, and everything.But the reason not to drill is untenable. You drill as well, and that will help us as well.BAIER: Mara, last thing. For the McCain campaign to send out these tire gauges and say this is the Obama plan, is that-- LIASSON: This is not the whole Obama plan.I think, as Fred always says, he loves a good political stunt. This is a good political stunt. They get to send out the little props.Then, of course, the Obama campaign answered with e-mails from NASCAR and all sorts of other people who actually say that inflating your tires is a very good idea--maybe not the answer to the oil energy crisis, but it's a good idea and it will save some energy.BAIER: So inflate your tires.KRAUTHAMMER: It is not even a tenth of a hundredth of the solution BAIER: All right, last word on this topic.The president heads to China for the Olympics while China deals with some Olympic-sized problems. We'll talk about that when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: President Bush and the first lady, you'll see her in a bit, taking off on the final trip, likely to be the final trip to Asia, the Beijing Olympic games the centerpiece of that trip.But, of course, the politics surrounding all of this, the protests, also Internet monitoring in Beijing, all a topic of conversation as he heads to Asia. We will talk a little bit about that trip, and perhaps the implications of it.Back with the panel. Charles, as the president heads there, there are a lot of questions about how Beijing will handle these games.KRAUTHAMMER: Look, if you are going to have Olympics in a dictatorship, you have to expect stuff to happen, and it's happening. The curtailment of the internet, the putdown and protests.And what we saw, the protesters in the street today are women, mostly older people who are -- a million driven out of their homes-- to make room for the plush hotels that westerners will be staying in, and athletes will be staying in.That's what happens in a command economy, in a command society that's run by Leninists. So you have got to expect that.But look, this is a political event. When the Olympics were given to countries like Italy, Japan, and Germany in the 60's and 70's, it was a way to welcome them back into the international community after the second World War.It's also a way of anointing a country as a great power--Nazi Germany in '36, the Soviet Union in '80, although it went awry because of Afghanistan, Seoul in '88, and now China. This is a coming out. It is an announcement of her status as a great power. That's what all of this is about.As long as it isn't a catastrophe, the Chinese will have succeeded in doing this.BAIER: The president, Mara, says that it's about the Games. The administration says they make points all the time with the Chinese about human rights. There are still a lot of people who say he shouldn't be there.LIASSON: It's not just about the Games.And there's two ways the Olympics can be a reward or an incentive, as Charles said. For some countries it's a reward for joining the community of nation and living up to all their standards. In this case it isn't that. It's an incentive.The theory was that this will promote openness in China, and also, maybe, shine a spotlight on all of China's failures so far to live up to the international standards, and they certainly have so far in terms of just pollution and repression and Internet access.I really wonder at the end of this how many stories journalists who are over there to cover the games will be able to do about other things that are going on in China. It's going to be pretty hard for them.But I still think, in the end, China could end up with a black eye, not just a triumphant week.BAIER: What's your take?BARNES: I don't care how many other stories they do that are not about the athletes. I don't want to read them! I don't want to hear them!Look, it was a terrible idea to give these games to China. The Chinese are going to run them like Hitler ran them in 1936!But here is what matters. Here is what I want to see. -- I want to see the American basketball team, see if they are as good as the greatest basketball team ever, the ""Dream Team"" in 1992 with Barkley and Jordan. I want to see the women's soccer team. I want to see the track and field.That's what I want to see. I want to get--look, horrible politics there. As Charles says, what do you expect out in a dictatorship? But let's concentrate on the athletes.BAIER: There you go. Fred has the last word for this panel.Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2008 FOX News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)HOUSE MINORITY LEADER JOHN BOEHNER, R-OHIO: Yes, we have been lucky. But luck is not effective strategy for fighting the terrorist threat.SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: The harder we work, the luckier we get.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: On Capitol Hill today, the politics of close calls when it comes to terrorist attempts. Meantime, we're finding out new information about the suspect, Faisal Shahzad, and that he may be linked in some way to another character, Anwar al-Awlaki, the radical cleric who's tied to the Fort Hood shootings, the Christmas Day bomber.Based on evidence and interviews so far we are told that Shahzad is fan of Awlaki's CDS to promote the cleric's extremist ideology, and at this preliminary stage we haven't seen or heard of any e-mails between Awlaki and Shahzad. However, it raises a lot of questions as we've been talking about this investigation over the past few days.Lets' bring in our panel: Steve Hayes, senior writer for the Weekly Standard; Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National Public Radio, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer.I should point out this also adds to the investigation into the Pakistani Taliban connection and how Shahzad may have been a part of that. Steve?STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Well, certainly the fact he was at the very least inspired by Anwar al-Awlaki is not significant. We heard this not only with the Fort Hood shooter with Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab on Christmas day who met with al-Awlaki allegedly, but we've seen this with the Fort Dix attackers. A number of people have been either directed by al-Awlaki or inspired by al-Awlaki. So it's not an insignificant development. It actually matters.But what I think is very important that we have seen in the past couple days is the ties to a variety of Pakistani terrorist groups and suspicious individuals seem to be growing by the minute. Every hour we learn of some new meeting or some new liaison, some new discussion in addition to his having been trained in north Waziristan.I think the question then is why again were the administration officials talking about this on the record and on background downplaying -- almost dismissing -- these foreign connections initially when we now see them in spades?And the other point is I've talked to people who have been briefed about this by various members of the intelligence community. They are not providing -- the intelligence community right now, law enforcement community -- not providing details on these foreign connections to lawmakers on Capitol Hill or to others asking questions and certainly members of the media.There is a real question why they are not going to do this. If it's because they're afraid they won't be able to prosecute him by briefing members of Congress and other folks, they need to explain exactly why that is going to affect the prosecution.MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: I think they're still in the process of collecting information of exactly what ties he had.I do think the initial statements that it looks like he was a lone wolf or he acted alone. He might have acted alone but he clearly had some connections to other groups, he got training overseas, he was inspired by others. Now it's very possible he was on his own in terms of building this car bomb.But I think that this time, though, unlike the Christmas Day bomber, the administration did respond more rapidly. They did not rule out terrorism, you know, they called it a terrorist incident pretty fast. And I think every time one of these things happens they're a little bit faster off the mark.But sure, there are tons of questions. They have plenty of questions about the no-fly list, how it worked, why he got on the plane at all, why he was able to get on the plane at all.BAIER: And how he flew back and forth from Pakistan after being a naturalized citizen.How is this playing in the American public? A new Fox News Opinion Dynamics poll is out and shows was the failed Times Square bomb plot, was it a success for Homeland Security? And 47 percent say no, the car bomb left in Times Square, yes, bomber caught, no one hurt, 42 percent.And then you look at the politics of this, quickly Charles, which party would do a better job on terrorism from the poll, an uptick for Republicans to 49 percent and Democrats at 29 percent. How does this all play how this is handled?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I think it's a very realistic reaction that we see in the polls. People understand that it was a failure in the sense that it was pure luck that nobody was killed. Pelosi says it was hard work. The president said it was the vigilance of people there and the authorities. That's rubbish. The guy didn't know how to put the bomb together and had he had, you'd have a lot of dead Americans. So that was pure luck.The second part after the attempt and capturing him in two days was successful police work. And I think there is a lot of recognition of that.The I think reason you see this huge spread in the polls of trusting Republicans or Democrats on this issue in general is precisely because of what Steve was talking about, the way the administration always instinctively wants to pretend, at least at the beginning, that it's a one-off the thing, which is what the secretary of Homeland Security initially said, as Obama said after the Christmas day attack. He said -- what was it -- it was an individual extremist. They don't want to talk about the overall structure of this, which is that it's part of jihad. They're all connected in the sense that they are adherents to a jihadist movement with a lot of tentacles and that is what is behind them.And the fact they refuse to do it makes people worry about whether they really have a grasp on this, whether they're serious about this. What is war in Afghanistan about? What are the Predator attacks in Pakistan about? They are all connected with what is happening here and the administration refuses to make any connection because it will not use the word ""jihad"" or ""Islamist.""BAIER: Mara, what about this? Is this a scenario this is death by 1,000 paper cuts for the administration after these red flags come out, these little connections, maybe not so little connections come out day after day.LIASSON: I actually have a different interpretation of these poll numbers.First of all, the Democratic numbers haven't changed much since July. And what this represents is an intensification of a natural advantage that Republicans have on this issue. They have had it for some time.I think that there was a period when it got a little bit closer, but that was when the Democrats in general were riding high. The Democrats in general are very low right now. And a lot of times when a party starts dropping and there is tremendous anti-incumbent and anti-Democratic feeling, the other numbers go with it.I don't think seven-point boost for Republicans from July to now and no change for Democrats is due to their reaction to these individual incidents.KRAUTHAMMER: This is a 20-point spread. And Republicans --LIASSON: Yes, but it has been around for awhile.KRAUTHAMMER: Republicans don't a national advantage.Two years ago on Election Day the Republicans had a president whose popularity was around Saddam Hussein's.LAISSON: And that's when their advantage disappeared, but they have had a long-standing advantage on this issue.HAYES: It's also cumulative --KRAUTHAMMER: The numbers are declining as they remain in power and they are not dealing with it.HAYES: It's also a cumulative effect. The president got high marks for handling of the Christmas Day bombing that many people in Washington, many counterterrorism officials believed that he botched.The real question is how you define success. Is it a success, can the administration claim success and, as Robert Gibbs said yesterday, celebrate this achievement of law enforcement because the bomber failed and then they apprehended him? Or is success preventing attacks before they happen, which is the way the Bush administration defined them?That is the key distinction and I think that is the debate we're seeing playing out in the media now.BAIER: Shahzad told the custom agents, ""I've been expecting you.""KRAUTHAMMER: Did he say he opposed health care reform?(LAUGHTER)BAIER: It's been a jam-packed news day. We hoped to get Shannon Bream's piece on the National Day of Prayer in the show tonight. Instead, you'll have to visit our homepage, FoxNews.com/specialreport, to see that full report.Next, the panel's take on the Greek economy and today's wild wide on Wall Street.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Thousands of protesters marching through the streets of Athens today after lawmakers there approved cuts needed to secure international loans. Basically, this is to help Greece get out of their debt crisis and there's a lot of skepticism that it might not even help, despite all these cuts, that the debt crisis might spread to Spain and Portugal and elsewhere.Meantime, later in the afternoon, this happened in the U.S. market, the Dow Jones Industrials taking a dive nearly 1,000 points over just a few minutes. This is a time lapse shot. And it was found out that Procter and Gamble had a major trade error and this caused the immediate dive.But there's a lot of jittery folks on Wall Street about the Greek crisis. We're back with the panel about all of this.Mara, let's talk about Greece first.LIASSON: And for a very long time we all thought Greece was the cause of that tumble.BAIER: In part it may be.LIASSON: But it was the background noise and the environment in which it happened, if it wasn't the proximate cause.Look, Greece, whose debt is now, I think about 115 percent of GDP -- ours is about 84 now -- and they have to impose tough austerity measures, which means tax hikes and spending cuts and the people of Greece, as you can see, didn't like it one bit and rioted.And this is something that could spread, kind of debt contagion could spread to Spain, Portugal, you know, Ireland. It's scary.And there's a couple of things about it. Number one, the U.S. is concerned that it could have a spillover effect to us. But also this in a bigger way is our problem. We have unsustainable deficits that are going to have to be cured with something similar, maybe not as draconian, budget cuts, cuts in spending, and maybe some kind of tax hikes.And I'm not saying that Americans will be going in the streets and throwing Molotov cocktails.HAYES: They might. Just wait.It's interesting -- what is interesting about it, there was a report in The New York Times over the weekend --BAIER: You're not endorsing Molotov cocktails, just to clarify.HAYES: I'm not endorsing violence. If you want to protest spending, great.There was a report in The New York Times over the weekend that was widely overlooked in part because I think the significant detail of it was buried. But the report said that in best part of the austerity rules that Greece agreed to in order to get the bailout from the IMF and from Europe, one of the things that they had to do was move to privatize their health care system. It was too statist, their health care system.So at the same time that the IMF and others are demanding that Greece move to privatize or spin off part of the state run health care system in order to make it more efficient and liberalize the economy, we are moving in the opposite direction. There is a great irony there that adds to Mara's point.BAIER: Not only that, but the International Monetary Fund is largely supported by the U.S. Now, of the $140 billion going to Greece, there is a smaller percentage, like 7 billion something -- still $7 billion of U.S. taxpayer money to bail out Greece.That doesn't sit well with a lot of folks.KRAUTHAMMER: That's so. When Obama came in last year at the G-20, he wanted in one of his ""We Are the World"" moments he opened a hundred billion dollar line of credit for the IMF, and he threw a few billion more as a gift, his way of saying here we are. Love America again, and he thought it would help us in the foreign affairs. So I wasn't terribly happy about that.Nonetheless, we have been the leader of the IMF since the founding in the early '40s and we have been the largest contributor and it's absolutely necessary. It has helped allies like Poland. You've got it as a backstop. Yes, there is a few of our billion in it and nobody likes the bailout of the banks, the autos or the Greeks.Nonetheless, you have to do it. If this contagion happens, we're not an island. It would spread to Portugal, Italy, to Spain, and ultimately all of Europe and it takes us down with it.In the way there was a huge reluctance to pass the TARP to bailout the banks, which was rather unpopular, it was the right thing to do, it saved our economy. Saving the Greeks by helping the IMF is the right thing to do.BAIER: And you know the market today felt like that day that the House didn't pass the TARP.KRAUTHAMMER: Exactly.Content and Programming Copyright 2010 Fox News Network, LLC.
