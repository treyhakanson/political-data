SEAN HANNITY, HOST:  And welcome to ""Hannity.""  And tonight, the race for the White House is in the final stretch, and voters will be headed to the polls in just 18 short days.  Now, Donald Trump -- he'll be here in just a minute with reaction.But first, it's been a very big week in politics.  Now, the candidates -- they faced off in their third and final debate in Las Vegas.  The liberal mainstream media -- they lost their minds over Donald Trump's comments about accepting election results, despite, of course, a lot history of Democrats doing the exact same thing.  And although Fox News cannot independently verify, undercover tapes from Project Veritas appear to expose very sinister schemes by Democrats to incite violence at Trump rallies and to commit massive voter fraud.And tomorrow, the GOP nominee will make a major pledge to American voters in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Joining us now with details, 2016 Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.  Mr. Trump, how are you?DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I'm very good, thank you, Sean.HANNITY:  Can you give us a preview?  It almost sounds like a ""Contract with America"" or promises to America that you're going to be talking about tomorrow.  What can you tell us?TRUMP:  Well, we're going to be doing a lot of things.  We're going to be lowering taxes.  We're going to be strengthening our borders.  We're going to be getting rid of regulations.  The regulations are going to be gone because, I mean, you look at this country, what's happening with regulations.  And we need them for security and we need them for certain things like the environment, but our regulations are just taking over our companies.  We can't compete anymore.We're going to be terminating, repealing and replacing ObamaCare. We're going to be saving our 2nd Amendment.  There are a lot of things, Sean. It's going to be -- I think it's going to be very special.HANNITY:  I talk a lot about the profound differences, the Supreme Court, vetting refugees, saying ""radical Islam,"" cutting taxes, raising taxes, keeping ObamaCare, getting rid of ObamaCare, building a wall, not building a wall, energy independence, no independence, education to down or to the states -- those are deep, profound differences.Do you think the voters understand the choice that is theirs this election?TRUMP:  Well, I think they do, and I think if they watched the debates, they would really understand a lot.  I mean, right now, I think you have two very clear -- you have a really clear choice between Hillary Clinton and myself.And if you just look at the stances on everything -- she's going to raise taxes, I'm going to lower taxes.  She's going to increase regulations, I'm going to cut regulations down to a minimum, a good number, but down to a minimum.And there's so many different things.  We're going to rebuild the military. We're going to take care of our vets.  We're going to save the 2nd Amendment.  We're going to repeal and replace ObamaCare, which is a total disaster.  She wants to make it even a bigger mess and going to spend trillions and trillions of dollars on it.  And it's crazy what's going on.HANNITY:  Yes.TRUMP:  And so you have really clear choice.  You have a very, very distinct choice.HANNITY:  You have been very critical in the media throughout this entire process.  Now through Wikileaks, we know the following news organizations -- Univision, NBC, ABC, CBS, The New York Times, Politico, The Boston Globe-- all of these organizations --  CNN -- in one way, fashion or form have been in the pocket of Hillary Clinton.  What's your reaction to that?TRUMP:  Well, it's totally brutal.  I mean, you can do something that's, you know, just fabulous, it's perfect, everything's great, and then they end up giving you bad news and bad stories, bad coverage.It's the single greatest pile-on.  They say -- this isn't me saying it, this is other people, and even news organizations -- the single greatest pile-on.  Despite that, you just saw the crowd we had outside.  We're in Pennsylvania now.  We just left North Carolina.  I'm going back to Pennsylvania.  I'm going to a different section in Pennsylvania in a little while.  We have a massive crowd there.It's been unbelievable what's going on.  And I think that it's not pollable, although, as you know, three polls came out today saying I'm leading nationwide.And look, it's a question of taxes.  It's a question of borders.  Do we want to have a country or not?  We're going to have strong borders.  And we're going to have people come into our country, but Sean, they're going to come in legally, through a process.  They're going to come in legally.So you know, I think a lot was learned in the debates.  I think you understand how we did and how well we did in the debates, and I think we really showed a big difference.HANNITY:  I want to ask you -- and you did bring this up during the debate. I only want to play you one small clip of the Project Veritas videos, and it's about the flow of money to these operatives that admit and brag that they're fomenting and causing violence, even back in the Chicago incident in March, but also talking about a massive voter fraud plan that they have and they want to orchestrate.I want you to hear how the money flows and then respond to the two specific tapes.  Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I am contracted with him, but I answer (INAUDIBLE) the head of special events for the DNC and the head of the special events and political (ph) for the campaign.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE) DNC (INAUDIBLE) DNC (INAUDIBLE) Democracy Partners.  Democracy Partners paid (ph) the Foval group.  The Foval group goes and executes (EXPLETIVE DELETED).(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  All right, so let me read it.  It says the campaign pays the DNC, the DNC pays Democracy Partners, Democracy Partners pays the Foval group. They are the people bragging about fomenting violence at your events, inciting it.  And they're the people that also talk at length about massive voter fraud in this election.  And you came under heavy fire after the debate for saying, I'll keep you in suspense about accepting the election outcome.  What is your reaction to these tapes?TRUMP:  Sean, I've been saying for a long time it's a rigged system.  It's totally -- it's just terrible, what's going on.  And then the politicians play right along with it.I mean, you have 1.8 million people who are dead who are registered to vote, and some of them absolutely vote.  Now, you know, tell me how they do that.  There's only one way.  But you have 2.5 million people or so that are registered in two states.  That means they're voting twice.Look, we have a system.  I'm a big believer in the system.  I love our country.  But I think I've done a great service by pointing this out, and a lot of people agree with what I'm saying.  That I can tell you.But when you look at those tapes, it's disgusting.  Our rally in Chicago -- that's where they were.  They were there.  And nobody could figure out what was going on.  Where did these -- they're real thugs, by the way, real thugs.  And injured policemen.  They injured people.  And they should be put in jail.  I mean, these are bad people.  And again, it's a rigged system.  And who got blamed for it?  Our rally people, us, me, everybody.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP:  It had nothing to do with us.HANNITY:  Well, the Democratic operative overseeing this visited the Obama White House 342 times.  What does that mean to you?TRUMP:  Well, I think it's a disgrace, and I guess he saw the president 44 times, they say.  Who knows?  But I think it's disgraceful.  Can you imagine, the one who was overseeing violence -- and this is a criminal act. You know, you -- I don't know if you saw the picture.  Cops were leaving -- these policemen, these great people were leaving with massive gashes in their head from these people.  These are professional thugs.  They were being paid $1,500 a day, and they got cell phones out of it.No, this is a very serious problem.  And I think come November 8th, I think we're going to win, and maybe we're going to win bigger than people ever even dreamed.  When you look at Pennsylvania, you look at what's happening here, when you look at North Carolina where I just left, you look at Ohio, and you see what's happening -- you see what's happening with some of the jobs, the companies that are leaving our country and going to Mexico and other places.  You see what's happening with ObamaCare, which is such a disaster! ObamaCare is a catastrophe!  The premiums are going up 60, 70, 80 percent.  The care is no good.  You can't even get it.  The deductible -- I mean, say what you want.  Bill Clinton said this is the craziest thing I've ever seen.  He said that.HANNITY:  Yes.TRUMP:  And he probably suffered...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP:  But he said ObamaCare is a disaster.  It is a total disaster.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  And coming up, part two of my interview with Donald Trump, and I'll ask him about the Wikileaks revelations, plus the original insurgent, Patrick J. Buchanan, will joining us, and he is calling out the establishment saying they fear Donald Trump.And also later tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, SECRETARY OF STATE:  (INAUDIBLE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  There's Hillary Clinton caught on tape back in 2010 lecturing her staff at the State Department about the importance of cyber security.  It's a video you've got to see to believe.That and more tonight right here on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(NEWSBREAK)HANNITY:  And welcome back to ""Hannity,"" and here is part two of my interview with the 2016 Republican nominee, Donald Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  As I talk to you, I'm going to put up the headlines of Wikileaks and the things we've discovered, including the latest solicitation, $12 million from a country that Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, thought abusing their own citizens, $12 million, also a paid appearance to go to the Clinton Foundation.  On the side of you right now is a list of all of these revelations.I know you've been paying attention to it.  The media has not.  They've largely ignored it.  What does this tell you about the Clintons and about -- about the campaign and about their tactics?  I mean, they would -- they even exposed how they would go after Obama and his father being a Muslim and that Obama used cocaine and going after Bernie Sanders, and of course, you.What do you get out of these Wikileaks revelations?TRUMP:  Well, take a look at what's going on.  I mean, look at -- as an example -- this wasn't Wikileaks, but look at what you just said about the voter fraud that was uncovered with the tapes.  Look at what you said about the thugs going into arenas and starting problems.Look at what came out today about The New York Times, where they have reporters that are soft or safe or something.  And I have those same reporters, and they are brutal.  They're not brutal, they're dishonest. They're totally dishonest.  It's, you know, totally dishonest group of people.And you just take a look at what's happened.  Look at how you get set up.  I mean, they say you saw somebody in 1902 and you touched the person.  I mean, give me a break!  This is stuff that all doesn't exist, Sean.  This is dirty, disgusting stuff.  And they'll find out.  I'll be revealed at some point.  This is dirty, disgusting stuff.HANNITY:  Yes.TRUMP:  And you know what?  It's no way -- it's no way that it should be. We're supposed to be a great democracy.  It's no way that it should be.  I mean, a certain magazine wrote some horrible things.  I guess it came out today.  Nobody reports.  I'm not going to get involved in it, but nobody reports it.HANNITY:  Well, I actually reported it...TRUMP:  But if somebody calls up the newspaper and says just one thing, they make a big deal out of it.HANNITY:  Well, I mean, they interviewed a woman on CNN for 45 minutes!  It turns out she's claiming you were molesting her on a plane, but it was OK for 15 minutes, and then an eyewitness came on with Judge Jeanine Pirro that said that never happened, I was sitting right next to them.  And she was on a public plane with a lot of people.  You would think she would have cried out for help, considering the length of time.They went with that, but you're right, they'll ignore The National Enquirer, which is what I think you're referring to.TRUMP:  By the way, it never happened.  Never happened.HANNITY:  Right.  Well...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP:  Just so you understand, all that stuff, it was fabricated, made up, never happened.  When you see -- they come, like, every two days.  Never happened!HANNITY:  How does CNN...TRUMP:  Never, ever happened!HANNITY:  How does CNN put the woman on for 45 minutes, and then the guy that was sitting next to you...TRUMP:  I think it's a disgrace.HANNITY:  ... they don't even ask him one question?TRUMP:  It's the most rigged system I've ever seen.  And I've been talking about it for a long time.  And it was rigged against Bernie Sanders and it's rigged even more against me.HANNITY:  Well...TRUMP:  It's a disgrace.HANNITY:  By the way...TRUMP:  They poison -- they poison the voters with this kind of stuff and this kind of junk that never happened!HANNITY:  Well, by the way...TRUMP:  It's not like a question, like, it may have.  It never -- none of it ever happened!HANNITY:  Obama, Al Gore, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders have all themselves at different points said it's a rigged system.  But I don't have time to get into it now.I was glad to see the other night -- there's so much money that have come from countries, like the million-dollar gift from Qatar -- Qatar allows marital rape and martial beatings.  The 25 -- up to $25 million to the Clinton Foundation from the Saudis, the $10 million from the Saudis from the Clinton library -- women can't drive.  They're told how to dress.  Gays and lesbians are killed.  Christians and Jews are persecuted.  But she takes the money.You want her to give it back.  Has anybody in the media followed up on that?TRUMP:  She should give it back.  No, absolutely not.  You're not surprised.  But she should give that money back.  I brought it up during the debate.  Give the money back.  It's $25 million at a minimum.  Give the money back.  She didn't want to answer that question, if you noticed.HANNITY:  Yes, I did notice that.  But I can -- how can you be the champion of women's rights, gay and lesbian rights, religious freedom and take money from countries that abuse all those groups?TRUMP:  Sean, you have seen things and I've had -- I've seen things, and I've been going through this.  I've never -- nobody could imagine that this could happen in the United States.  Nobody can even imagine it.But I'll tell you what.  We're going to win the election, and we're going to clean out the swamp.  You know I'm using the expression, we're going to drain...HANNITY:  Drain the swamp, yes.TRUMP:  ... the swamp of Washington, D.C.  It is a swamp of absolute corruption!  It's absolutely corrupt!  And we're going to drain the swamp. We'll see what happens.  We're going to drain it.But we're going to win.  We have such enthusiasm.  And you saw what -- I just left this rally two minutes ago.  In fact, I'm sitting in a room that's about 200 degrees.  I've never seen it...(LAUGHTER)TRUMP:  It's like a steam room.HANNITY:  I know (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP:  And no, it's just wonderful.  But I'll tell you what.  At least you're on the side of, you know, exposing some of this stuff.  The press doesn't want to do it.It's incredible what's going on in our country.  But come November, if you watch -- you saw this arena.  It was packed with thousands of people outside.  Something is going on that's very, very special.  Plus, three polls came out today, including Rasmussen, and including another poll that called it the most accurately four years ago.  And they say I'm...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY:  It's a 1-point lead.  IBB, (sic) the Investors Business Daily TPP poll has you up by 1.  They have been the closest in the last three cycles.I do think there are a lot of balls up in the air that haven't been factored into the polls yet, including the last debate, including the Project Veritas videos, including -- I don't think the public is absorbing what I'm showing them every night in terms of the WikiLeaks reveals.All right, I know you've got to go.  I want to ask you a final question. And give me as detailed an answer as you can.  Tomorrow, you're going to make a pledge and put it on paper for the American people.TRUMP:  Right.HANNITY:  You're doing it in Gettysburg.TRUMP:  Right.HANNITY:  Give us a preview.  What is this about?  Is this like a ""contract with America""?TRUMP:  Sean, I want to do it tomorrow.  I don't want to do it right now. I really want to do it tomorrow.  I can only say we're going to make America great again.  We have so many problems.  Our taxes are too high. We're going to reduce them.  Our borders are weak.  Our regulations are crazy.  Drugs are pouring into our country.People are coming into the country that we really shouldn't have come into the country.  We have drug lords and criminals and murderers.  And I mean, what's going on in this country is incredible.  Hillary wants open borders where people can just flow through.  We're not going to have a country anymore.  We are going to do something very special, and tomorrow I think is going to be...HANNITY:  All right...TRUMP:  ... a special day at a special place.HANNITY:  Did you have fun at the Al Smith dinner?  Did you mind getting booed a little bit?TRUMP:  I did.  No, I -- look, we -- we say what's true, and some people don't like hearing it, but we say what's true.HANNITY:  That's a pretty liberal crowd, though.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP:  ... people in there.HANNITY:  Yes, they...TRUMP:  No, that's OK.  It was a great dinner.  It was a great dinner.  No, I enjoyed it.  I thought it was great.HANNITY:  All right.  Did you get in trouble when you went home to Melania last night?TRUMP:  No, I didn't.  She was great.  She understood.  It was -- that was probably the moment of the evening.  People loved it.HANNITY:  All right, Mr. Trump, have fun on the campaign trail.  I know you got a lot more to get to today.  Appreciate your time.TRUMP:  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Sean.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  And coming up next tonight right here on ""Hannity""...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  If Hillary Clinton gets elected, we've got four more years of Obama, we have a disaster!  We have ISIS all over!(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Donald Trump continuing to go after Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail.  The original insurgent, Patrick J. Buchanan, will join us.and also tonight...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  (INAUDIBLE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Well, that was Hillary Clinton back in 2010, talking to her staff at the State Department at the real importance of cyber security.  Pretty hypocritical.  Frank Luntz, Pat Caddell -- they're here with reaction and more as we continue to tonight on ""Hannity.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  We have a bunch of babies running our country, folks.  We have bunch of losers!  They're losers!  They're babies!  We have a president, all he wants to do is campaign!  His wife, all she wants to do is campaign!If Hillary Clinton gets elected, we've got four more years of Obama, we have a disaster.  We have ISIS all over!(BOOS)TRUMP:  We won't win anymore.  And your taxes are going up, and she wants to double up and triple up on ""Obama care,"" which has to be repealed and replaced.  It's a disaster.We are going to start making things in America again!  We are going to start making things in North Carolina again!  We are bringing back our jobs!  America first.  Remember that.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  All right, that was Donald Trump earlier today at a rally in North Carolina as he looks to build momentum ahead of election day.My next guest, the original insurgent, Patrick J. Buchanan.  He penned a new article about the panic within the Republican establishment, writing, quote, ""The establishment is horrified at Donald's defiance because deep within its soul, it fears that the people for whom Trump speaks no longer accept its political legitimacy or moral authority.""Joining us now with reaction, the author of ""The Greatest Comeback,"" Patrick J. Buchanan.  Pat, I agree 100 percent.  There's a political earthquake that is going on.  And in 20 days, there's going to be a huge discussion about the future of the Republican Party.One of the things most frustrating to me is when 65 percent in every primary poll of Republicans saying they feel betrayed and voting in record numbers for Trump, and then the establishment stepping all over him, being more critical to him than either Obama or Hillary.  I think they have made-- they have totally miscalculating the mood of the public!  Your thoughts.PAT BUCHANAN, ""THE GREATEST COMEBACK"" AUTHOR:  I tell you, Sean, it's not only the Republican establishment.  The national establishment has lost the country.Trump's great accomplishment is to expose the fact that the establishment of this country is responsible for insecure borders, the masses coming across our borders, invading our country.  They're responsible for the trade deals that have deindustrialized America and destroyed the jobs of millions of American workers!  And they're responsible for getting us into endless and unwinnable wars.  And he has exposed the disconnect between the national establishment, frankly, and the American people!And that is a great achievement for him.  And WikiLeaks, Sean, has come along and exposed the fact that the core of the establishment, the media, is basically in cahoots with the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party!HANNITY:  Pat, what we have learned -- and that's another fight that we'll have November 9th this year, because this needs to be exposed in even more detail.  But of course, with our election coverage, we don't have the full- time to devote to it.But you've got a Republican establishment, a Democratic establishment, a globalist establishment and a media establishment that is all sort of, in ways we never dreamed of, aligned together!  And it's now all been exposed, but I don't think the American people are absorbing the magnitude of that to this point.Will they absorb it within the next 18 days?BUCHANAN:  You know, I think -- let me say this, Sean.  The enormous fire and energy and size of the Trump rallies, the magnificent turnout inside the Republican Party for Cruz and for Trump, the huge turnout for Bernie Sanders, the fact that Trump, as of about three or four weeks ago, was tied with Hillary and had momentum -- that tells you the country wants to be rid of this establishment!The way we're going now, we could get a real possibility that the Republican elites who were repudiated in the primaries and in their party and the Democratic elites who basically fixed it against Bernie -- they will together control the destiny of the country, and we will have nation whose establishment represents Washington, not the nation it is supposed to serve!I think we're headed for some very difficult times.  And frankly, some of these tactics that you have mentioned on your show about these folks in Chicago are really somewhat greater -- more disturbing than some of the things that happened in Watergate!HANNITY:  You know, I mean, look at what they're saying.  You know, I just-- I just showed this to Mr. Trump.  You've got Hillary's campaign, Pat, paying the DNC, paying Democracy Partners, Democracy Partners paying an activist group that is on tape bragging about, taking credit for violence at Trump events.  It's organized everywhere, putting in these people to intimidate others and massive voter fraud on a level -- again, both of these things funded...BUCHANAN:  Let's talk about...HANNITY:  ... according to their own words by Hillary and her campaign!BUCHANAN:  Let's talk about the individuals that they allegedly -- now, if it is true that they sent people out to start fistfights and maybe ignite a riot and disrupt and destroy the Trump rally, if they were behind the Chicago thing, and if they were paid by the Clinton campaign, we are talking about the Clinton campaign financing brown shirt tactics in the streets of Chicago!They have called -- you have been called and I have been called fascist for something we said.  Look, if -- I mean, what took place in the attempt to disrupt and destroy a democratic rally -- those are fascist tactics in the streets of Chicago!  I was in Chicago in 1968.  Abe Ribicoff used that phrase, but he was attacking the Chicago cops, Sean!But if people are doing this, that is exactly -- that's what Goebbels and Rome (ph) and the others did with the brown shirts!HANNITY:  Yes.  I want to know if they're saying in their own words, is Hillary's campaign pays the DNC, the DNC pays Democracy Partners, Democracy Partners pays for those fomenting violence and plotting and scheming voter fraud -- is it a fair question?BUCHANAN:  It's not only...HANNITY:  What did Hillary know?  When did she know it?  What did her campaign know, when did she know it?  And by the way, this -- this guy, this operative who oversaw the whole thing -- he went to the Obama White House 342 times!  What did Obama know and when did he know it?BUCHANAN:  You know, exactly.  You know, Sean, the great question is if -- was this guy just shooting his mouth off and nothing happened and he wasn't paid for anything and he had some legitimate reason to go to the White House 300 times -- but let me say this.  I was in the White House in 1968, October 15th, they found out the dirty trickster, Donald Segretti, had been sending pizzas to a Muskie rally.I mean, we had an emergency meeting in the White House.  The FBI was all over this like a cheap suit!  Where is the -- I mean, they ought to immediately have this guy in and take a look at this and talk to the people involved in those riots in Chicago and question them as to whether somebody paid them, and does anybody know if these individuals again are just shooting their mouth off or they did what they're talking about!I mean, they were fired instantly.  That suggests to me that the people that fired them know they were up to no good!HANNITY:  Yes.  All right, Pat.  We're going to watch this.  What's your prediction?  How is this all going play out?  Who do you think's going to win this?BUCHANAN:  I think, you know -- I think the Donald's behind the eight ball right now, and what he's got to do, he's got to raise his polls basically in the general national polls from about -- to about at least 2 or 1 behind him (sic), and that's the only way I think you're going to tip the whole thing over.  He's got -- look, he's got to win Florida, Ohio, North Carolina...HANNITY:  North Carolina, yes.BUCHANAN:  ... Nevada and Iowa...HANNITY:  Iowa.BUCHANAN:  -and then he's short by about 5, if he holds into Arizona, of course, Texas, of course, and Georgia.So it's an uphill climb.  He knows it, I'm sure, as do the folks.  And I think there's still an outside chance to get that inside straight.  HANNITY:  Listen, Pat Buchanan, nobody thought you would beat a sitting president in New Hampshire, did they?  BUCHANAN:  No, they didn't.  But then they beat me in 33.  (LAUGHTER)HANNITY:  Well, you could have stopped right there.  It was a pretty big victory.  BUCHANAN:  Listen, in 92, Sean, I didn't win it, but they thought in the White House I did win in New Hampshire.  HANNITY:  All right, Pat Buchanan, the original insurgent, thank you.  And up next tonight right here on ""Hannity.""(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  She said I can't recall 39 times.  Well, that's a lie, because everything there she could recall.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Highlights from Donald Trump's rally today in Pennsylvania. We'll check in with Frank Luntz, Pat Caddell, they're here.  Plus, more WikiLeaks revelations, the leaked e-mails now reveal Hillary Clinton's role in soliciting money for her family foundation allegedly runs far deeper than we all thought.  Mercedes Schlapp, Charlie Hurt, they're here with reaction as ""Hannity"" continues.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Yesterday you read the story of a great four-star general who told one story to the FBI.  They said it wasn't true, it might have been a lie. And guess what?  His life is destroyed.  He could go to jail for five years.  She lied over and over and over and over and over and over, 39 times, right?  She said to the FBI on July 4th weekend, not recorded, and not sworn in.  Not recorded and not sworn in.  She said I can't recall 39 times.  Well, that's a lie, because everything there she could recall.  (END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY:  Donald Trump slamming Hillary Clinton over her ongoing server scandal.  Also today said FOX News obtained a video from 2010 showing Hillary Clinton actually lecturing her staff at the State Department about, get this, using cyber security.  Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(INAUDIBLE)(END VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON:  Joining us now with reaction, pollster Frank Luntz and Fox News contributor Pat Caddell.  Mr. Luntz, all right, I was impressed.  Donald Trump according to the Frank Luntz focus groups won two of the three debates.  That's a very high bar.  FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER:  Yes, it is a high bar.  But the challenge for him now, he's running five or six points behind.  And Sean, there is a path. It's a very small one, very narrow one, but that path goes based on rhetorical questions, and I'm going to tell you three that you can ask again and again before Election Day.  Is America safer than it was eight years ago?  Does Hillary Clinton have the honesty and integrity to be president of the United States?  And who is more likely to hold Washington accountable?  If that is the focus, you can change millions of voter minds. The question is, will there be that discipline and will there be that focus.  HANNITY:  What was the last one?  LUNTZ:  The last one was is, who is more likely to hold Washington accountable?  HANNITY:  All right, Pat Caddell, what are your thoughts?  Where do you stand?  PAT CADDELL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think we stand -- it's a little unclear because the polls are everywhere.  And I find a lot of them pretty confusing.  I think I understand the business.  But I think he's several points behind probably.  But I think that there's more than a small pathway.  I think there's a big pathway.  The basic attitudes in this country are structured against the incumbent party, against Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.  If Donald Trump can rise to making this a referendum, even bigger than what Frank Luntz is saying.The real issue here is, who owns America, the people or the political class?  Whose ox is being gored?  The people know it's theirs.  They believe the system is rigged against them economically.  Trump's got to put these questions, and the question of, do we continue to go down the road of decline or do we make changes and do we overturn the corruption in Washington?  Those are huge issues.  His problem is he is being way too tactical and not strategic enough, in my opinion.  HANNITY:  Let me ask you this, do any of you think the polls, maybe there's a certain percentage of people who maybe won't say they're voting for Trump?  Or is that just fantasy thinking among the Trump supporters?  I tend to say you've got to believe the polls.  Do you think there's a possible Brexit effect?  I say you can't count on it.  What do you say, Frank Luntz?  LUNTZ:  I agree with you.  We polled in Brexit, and we had leave behind remain by two points.  For us the key is the subtext, what percentage of your friends and neighbors will vote to leave, by asking it that way, you're more likely to get an honest answer.  But, Sean, if the focus is just on the polls over the next 18 days, then nothing is going to change, because in the end voters don't vote on polls. And I agree with Pat.  The bigger the issue, the bigger the challenged, the more this is about change versus the status quo, the more likely you will get a change electorate.  Be it requires those kinds of questions to actually move the opinions of voters.  HANNITY:  I think that's well said, as you have traveled around the country, I know you have discussed this, it's always very difficult for a Republican, they have always got to thread the needle unless they can somehow break into and get some of those blue collar voters that have gone Democrat in recent years, get people in states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio locked in and Michigan.  Does Donald Trump Trump's message any more than past Republicans because he's different on issues involving trade?  LUNTZ:  Let me give you a straight answer.  The answer is yes, the message resonates more.  His persona is what concerns people.  And if it were just about his message, Sean, I believe his language versus Hillary's, his position versus Hillary's, Trump wins.  But on the persona they see her as being experienced, they see her as being presidential, and they're not sure--  HANNITY:  Even though 70 percent think she's a liar and untrustworthy?  LUNTZ:  Absolutely, and that should be the issue.  You just raised the point, Sean, if that's how they're voting, then Trump wins.  But that's not been the focal point over the last two weeks.  HANNITY:  And if he does that for the next 18 days, do you think he's going to come back in a big way?  LUNTZ:  It's tough because they're not going to be standing side by side again between now and Election Day.HANNITY:  All right, Frank Luntz, good to see you, thank you.  Coming up, more stunning revelations from the WikiLeaks document dump. Hillary Clinton allegedly tried to personally solicit, get this, a $12 million donation to the Clinton Foundation from the king of Morocco, by the way, which she acknowledged was corrupt.  Mercedes Schlapp, Charlie Hurt are here to weigh in and more straight ahead.     (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  And welcome back to ""Hannity."" So new revelations from WikiLeaks continue to expose Hillary Clinton and damage her campaign.  The mainstream media, they're mostly ignoring what's being released, but we're keeping very close tabs on it right here on this program.  Now, here are some of the biggest discoveries from this week alone.  Hillary Clinton personally tried to secure $29 million dollar donation from the king of Morocco under the condition that she's appear at a Clinton Foundation function in the country.Now, after Hillary Clinton apparently realized this would be after the launch of a presidential campaign and could hurt her politically, she then tried to back out.  But her close aide Huma Abedin faulted Hillary for the fiasco by saying, quote, ""She created this mess and she knows it.""We also have longtime Clinton ally Doug Band revealing that as a board member of the Clinton Global Initiative, he signed a conflict of interest agreement, but that, quote, ""Bill Clinton, he doesn't have to sign such a document even though he is personally paid by three Clinton Global Initiative sponsors, gets many expensive gifts for that, and some of that at home I could have had five different examples of things like that.""Anyway, then there's the interim DNC chair dawn Donna Brazile who is already under fire leaking primary town hall questions to Hillary Clinton and her campaign, and in another email she trashed President Obama's economy.  She said, quote, ""I think people are more in despair about how things are.  Yes, new jobs, but they're low wage jobs.  Housing is a huge issue.  Most people pay half of what they make to rent.""  Here now with reaction, Fox News contributor Mercedes Schlapp, from The Washington Times, Charlie Hurt.  I have been saying that about the economy.  I'm glad that somebody really knows the truth about it, because they're not saying it on the campaign trail, Mercedes.  MERCEDES SCHLAPP, WASHINGTON TIMES: No, no, I think that there is a sense of, let's stay, quiet about the economy.  I mean, President Obama and clearly Michelle Obama, since they have been out on the campaign trail for Hillary Clinton, they have made it a point to ensure that, keep a happy face on and everything's going to be OK, and it's going to be fine under Hillary Clinton.  And so I think what's disturbing is the fact that Hillary Clinton is really trying to -- I don't quite understand her vision, but sell herself as saying she's the one that's going to be able to create economic growth. But when you look at her plan, it's very clear, Sean, that her tax plan alone increases taxes, we're going to see more regulations.  We're going to see more of the same, which means economic disappoint for Americans.  HANNITY:  What is your take on the whole Morocco issue and the $12 million?  Is it pay to play, Charlie, because it certainly seems like it?  CHARLES HURT, POLITICAL COLUMNIST, WASHINGTON TIMES:  I think without any doubt that it's pay to play.  And what's really funny about is it's not surprising at all.  And as we dig through all these things, this makes Machiavelli come across as ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.""  And what I love about it, the thing, my favorite part of it, all the lies, all the corruption, all the pay to pay, the fully using the State Department as a vending machine for favors and massive donations for the foundation, is this is all being exposed.  And we have never seen an exposure like this of the inner workings of a campaign.  And of course it happens to the most secretive campaign that we have seen in modern times, and it is so rich that all this is spilling out on the Clintons.  HANNITY:  Could you imagine, Mercedes.  Look at, for example, what happened in San Bernardino, they said John Podesta said, ""Well, I wish his name wasn't Syed Farook.  I wish it was Chris Hayes.""  And then Tony Podesta, his brother, chairman of Hillary's campaign, notified of an Islamic attack at a Somali restaurant in January, 14 kills, and his reply was, ""Oh, I had lobster there.""  And I'm thinking imagine if Trump had done any of those things.  And this is one of thousands that we're finding.  SCHLAPP:  It would have been political suicide if Trump, there would have been e-mails exposed like that.  But what disturbs me is that it's all about politics, it's all about what it's turning a terrorist attack, a tragedy on our homeland, into how do you best politically capitalize on the situation.  And then, furthermore, it goes into the division, the division into ethnicity, into gender, the anti-Catholic bigotry, going after the needy Latinos, it goes on and on.  And so what they're trying to do is the Democrats and the Clinton campaign, they have talked about branding Republicans as extremists, as racists, and trying to see if they can take the party down while they themselves are dividing us all up into these categories.  HANNITY:  Charlie, November 9th, win, lose, or draw, there is going to be on this program an analysis about how deeply entrenched and corrupt and abusively biased the news media is as revelations from WikiLeaks proves. But I want to point out one specific thing, how in 2015 in an email chain with Clinton staffers they were bragging, well, let's leak a speech to the friends in the media to show Clinton's speeches to all those fat cats were really nothing to worry about, cherry-pick it, release it, plausible deniability, manipulate the media to do what they want, the very people that are in their pocket.  What do you think of that propaganda technique of theirs that was revealed?  HURT:  Well, obviously it's working, it worked very well with them.  And obviously this is something that you've talked about for years and years about the absolute corruption in the media in terms of the way the deal with Republicans versus Democrats.  And in particular with the Clinton, the Clintons are so abusive of the media, and the media still treats them like this, which is kind of amazing.  But I really do think that one of the things that will happen at the conclusion of this race is that it won't just be people like you or Mercy talking about the corrupt media.  I think that the public, because even the public, the people who are going to be voting for Clinton, they are realizing that, yes, I'm going to vote for her, but she's a liar.  And even John Podesta says this has trouble.  So I think this is a breakthrough moment where people, I think it's the end of the media as we know it.  HANNITY:  Exit question, who's going to win this race, Mercedes?  SCHLAPP:  Oh, come on, Sean, that's unfair.  It's going to be tight until the very end.  It he can close it down to two points it will be interesting.  HURT:  With a little dose of hope, I will say Donald Trump.  HANNITY:  When we come back we need your help with an important ""Question of the Day."" We want your thoughts on the that question and more straight ahead.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY:  All right, time for our ""Question of the Day."" So with 18 days to go, how do you feel about the upcoming election?  Who do you think is going to win?  We want to hear from you.  Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter.  I can't tell you.  I have no feel of how this is going to play it.  It has been such an unpredictable year.  Anyway, we'll be back Monday with only 15 days to.  That is all the time we have left this evening.  As always, thank you for being with us and I hope you have a great weekend.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)SEN. TED CRUZ, FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If there is a path to victory, we launched this campaign intending to win. The reason we suspended the race last week is with Indiana's loss I didn't see a viable path to victory. If that changes, we will certainly respond accordingly.We've suspended the campaign because I can see no viable path to victory. Of course if that changed we would reconsider things. But let's be clear. We're not going to win Nebraska today. There should be no mystery, no excitement in that.If circumstances change, we will always assess changed circumstances.RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: It's all about keeping your voters loyal to you I think for what comes next in 2020.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Ted Cruz talking about a path to victory if one suddenly opened up. Let's be clear here: One is not opening up. Donald Trump is expected to get to 1,237, the majority needed. And there are some new polls in swing states about a possible general election. A Quinnipiac poll out in Ohio and Florida and Pennsylvania, and there you see the numbers. Hillary Clinton, essentially within the margin of error on all three states. But in Ohio, Donald Trump doing a little bit better there. Also today another vanquished opponent on the GOP side, Marco Rubio, speaking out for the first time again.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARCO RUBIO, FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He needs to appoint someone to be his vice presidential nominee that more fully embraces the things he stands for.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You mean no, you're not interested?RUBIO: And again, to be frank, I'm never had those conversations with anyone in his campaign. So I'm not -- I'm not saying that anyone has offered it to me or it's been suggested to me. I'm just saying to you that I believe he would be best served by someone who more fully embraces the things he stands for, and that's certainly not me.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Marco Rubio today. Let's bring in our special expanded panel tonight: Steve Hayes with The Weekly Standard; A.B. Stoddard, associate editor of The Hill, David Catanese, senior politics writer for U.S. News and World Report, and Tucker Carlson, host of ""Fox & Friends Weekend.""OK, Tucker, let's start with Ted Cruz, makes his return to the Senate and stirs up all kinds of stuff today.TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: I don't think that's real. I think he said that to calm Glenn Beck down and keep him from harming himself. You know what I mean, holding open the possibility.No, of course, you know, as you I think rightly noted, Donald Trump is going to be the nominee really against his own campaign. I mean, Trump has I think had a pretty bad week. He spent a lot of his time attacking Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush as if they're relevant. They no longer are of course, as if the primaries are still going.And yet, his numbers in this Quinnipiac poll are pretty amazing. He's doing bet anywhere Pennsylvania than Mitt Romney or John McCain did four and eight years ago. He beats Hillary in the gender gap. He's doing better among women than she's doing among men, et cetera, et cetera. He's considered more trustworthy in a lot of these swing states by voters. So I really think it's the strength of his message. Avert your gaze from Trump, look at what he is saying or what he stands for in the eyes of voters, I think it's a pretty compelling message, obviously.BAIER: Two-thirds of Republicans, Dave, in the West Virginia exit polling saying that trade is a driving force for them. They don't, they believe that two-thirds, two-thirds believe that trade costs jobs, which is Donald Trump's message.DAVID CATANESE, U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT: Trade, immigration, and sort of more of a leftist foreign policy coming back home think is what Trump is going to run on.But those Quinnipiac polls that came out were the best news that he's had all week since he was crowned presumptive nominee because, surprise, this guy is probably going to be competitive. Now, I talked to some pollsters today, they have some problems with the weighting in some of these states, not enough African-Americans in Florida, not enough independents here and there. But the bottom line is after a week of a lot of party leaders saying, we're hedging and hawing over when they can support him, this going to quell a lot of that. If this -- if these polls hold up and what the election looks like in August, people are going to get on board.BAIER: Yes, and it is good news as you continue to look at the exit polls out of West Virginia and some out of Nebraska popping up here. But there's another poll tonight, A.B., that shows Utah is close with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. And Utah is the reddest of red states. So you know, obviously you read into the polls in different states, different things.A.B. STODDARD, THE HILL: Right, Mississippi is in play at this point. It doesn't mean it's going to last, but when Mississippi and Utah are in play, that's not a good sign for the Republican nominee.But the Quinnipiac polls are great news, and I think David is right. It will calm the queasiness of Republicans who think he's going to lose in a landslide. But, yes, he still has a mountain to climb. There are race and gender gaps within those polls that are good news for him still. He has to -- he's got to go beyond a white voter base. He's just got to expand it. And that's the work he's going to do.Look, all his polling since he joined the nomination, the primary, you know, he topped the polls the entire time. Now he's at the bottom. It doesn't mean that these polls aren't real. He's got to make up some of this. And I think some of his tactics on, you know, Hillary as a dirty, mean, nasty enabler are just futile. I think they're a waste of his time.BAIER: But clearly they're coming differently at Hillary Clinton than any other Republican has.STODDARD: But there's so much to go after her on, the email scandal, her deception, her dishonesty. There's so much there, Benghazi. Just skip this stuff about, you know, being an enabler. I mean, I think that he should go after some women voters if he really wants to win in November.BAIER: What does he have to do, Steve, Trump, up on Capitol Hill Thursday with Ryan and McConnell?STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: I think he has first got to commit himself to outreach. What we've seen this past week in response to Paul Ryan's withholding his of his immediate endorsement is Donald Trump sort of lashing out. Sarah Palin, a top surrogate for Trump, going after Paul Ryan, says she's going to primary him. He's going to be like Eric Cantor, he's going to lose his seat. Trump himself taking shots at the people who resisted or sort coming to Trump or open to coming to Trump with resignation. I think he's got to embrace those.We've seen this before actually in 2008 and in 2012. In 2008 I remember sitting on the straight talk express with John McCain asking him why he wasn't reaching out more to conservatives, why he wasn't picking up the phone and calling Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity, trying to bridge that gap. And McCain's answer was basically at the time was, I don't need to.Mitt Romney came late I think to embracing and trying to go after the Tea Party, making sure that they were enthusiastic about him. He didn't have as much success as he might have had. Donald Trump saying this weekend, I don't need the conservatives -- that is crazy. He doesn't have the conservatives, the conservatives beyond the never-Trumpers, he will lose.BAIER: Ted Cruz wouldn't answer today whether he was going to officially endorse Donald Trump. He wouldn't take the question, really. Marco Rubio said he is supporting the nominee. He signed a pledge. What does it take to get these guys to say I'm in?CARLSON: I mean some are unwinnable. Trump has insulted them personally. I don't think you can overstate the effect of that. He's gone after them and their legacy, the legacy of the Bush administration. They're stung by it and a lot of them are not going to support him, of course.BAIER: Isn't Hillary Clinton the unifying factor?CARLSON: Potentially, but you've seen some Republicans come out and endorse her. He should win some conservatives, but I would say the Republican Party in Washington should also not ignore Trump's voters. And the one issue they could win a lot of voters back, he's won the Republican nomination beating 16 people, all of whom were backed in essence by Washington Republicans. There's a statement being made by voters to D.C. I think they just need to move on immigration. I actually think the details of economic policy, the subject that Ryan is most interested in, Trump would probably move on those. But they've got to demonstrate a good- faith effort to secure the borders and at least to rethink our current immigration scheme which has been in place for 51 years. Nobody is even willing to talk about it. Trump's voters clearly want a public conversation on that. Why can't they move on that?BAIER: Listen, I mean, these Republicans are nowhere near deporting illegal immigrants.CARLSON: But the population is. There was a series of polls in swing states done last week on how do you feel about a temporary ban on Muslim immigration? Everyone in D.C. is horrified by the idea. It's like evidence of membership in the Nazi Party. And yet across the country, huge numbers of people, 65 percent of Wisconsin voters favor that, not all Republicans, a lot of Democrats. It doesn't mean you should back it. It does mean you need to rethink your comfortable assumptions about immigration if you're the Republican Party.HAYES: Sure, but if you have principles and you believe that we shouldn't ban a religion, don't ban a religion -- in a country founded on freedom of religion it's not a good idea to ban a religion --CARLSON: It's a little more complex than that.HAYES: Even with asterisks?CARLSON: No.HAYES: Republicans can't just cast aside their principles, free trade because Donald Trump comes around and this orange guy suggests that free trade is bad, we're going to throw away 300 years of Adam Smith.CARLSON: I haven't noticed a lot of principles among Republicans in Washington. Perhaps they're there. They're hiding them well. I would just say look at Europe and the destruction underway now. One of the lessons -- it doesn't mean we need to ban people that are Muslims, I agree. That's an overstatement and kind of crazy. But it doesn't mean keeping your immigration regime the face of what's happening here is equally crazy.HAYES: I agree with entirely. I think they need to respond to this.CARLSON: And they refuse to.HAYES: But if you make the argument, you're not making it, others have made it, that they cast aside these pillars of conservatism because they're unpopular, because Donald Trump is making certain arguments about trade and about other things, I think that's unwise. And I think that is one of the reasons that you're seeing this resistance from some people. They don't want to support somebody who opposes the things they fought for and held most dear for years.CARLSON: If open borders is one of things they held most dear for years they're going to have to give up on it, because the country just doesn't support it. They defended it, and they need to change.BAIER: There are other people on the panel.(LAUGHTER)CARLSON: Sorry.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

3	3	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/01/05/will-president-executive-action-curb-gun-violence/	Will president's executive action curb gun violence?	"This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" January 5, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Hello everyone. I'm Eric Bolling along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""Today, President Obama unveiled the actions he plans to take without the consent of Congress to restrict gun use in America. Among them, expanding background checks to almost anyone buying a firearm from a dealer. He says his plans are constitutional. He also set some constraints on freedom are necessary to protect innocent people. And then, he got emotional.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Our unalienable right to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness, those rights were stripped from college kids in Blacksburg and Santa Barbara and from high schoolers in Columbine, and from first graders in Newtown, first graders. And from every family who never imagined that their loved one would be taken from our lives by a bullet from a gun. Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad. And by the way, it happens on the streets of Chicago every day.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Now listen, we all get emotional when you hear children being killed, but where was that emotion for the victims of San Bernardino terror attack? And where is the emotion calling Islamic terror what it is, Islamic and terrorism? Those tears, Mr. Obama, I think ISIS sees them as emotional strength or weakness? I'm just asking Juan, do you disagree with me?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Yeah, boy. You think John Boehner is a weak man? No.BOLLING: I didn't --(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: You're probably the wrong guy to ask on.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: OK, I'm just saying, I don't say. To me, I think this is what you want. I mean, Obama -- my thing is he's too cool at times. And so if you're asking me as a human being, I just think, I just think I don't want to be shot. I don't want to be walking in my neighborhood and some thug picked on. I don't -- I'm just tired of it.BOLLING: No, I don't -- believe me, I'm not disagreeing with that aspect of that. KG, what I'm kind of wondering about here is the gun control debate, the argument. When he goes for it, executive action, he opens the door. Does he open the door to more down the road?KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Well, of course, and right, this is his kind of favorite go-to. This is the way that he's able to achieve of the outcomes that he wants that are specific to his ideology. I don't begrudge him showing the emotion. He's a father and anybody talking about children and the loss of lives. But I also think about the children and the Christians that are being murdered and beheaded, and executed, and disabled children being executed by ISIS. And I want to see our president show that level of emotion, and resolve, and passion to achieve the ends that we need as far as it relates to national security and in keeping Americans safe. And doing the right thing, taking the position of power and influence that we have held in the world that people admire and respect that we are the ones you call when are you in greatest need. And I see that he has it, but I don't want him to cry about the Second Amendment. I want him to keep Second Amendment where it is, and worry about getting the bad guys that have the guns and not persecuting the guns.BOLLING: And that, he did, Greg, he pointed that out. It happens in Chicago every day, but I'm not sure that anything he proposed today would fix what's going on in Chicago every day.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: The thing about emotion is, and I do believe it's real, but emotion isn't facts. And one of the facts is in Chicago, for example, police shootings homicides are down, but other shootings are up. And gang violence is a big problem, but they can't go there on gang violence because one, if you come from a political background that says every prisoner is a political prisoner, you don't want to put people in prisons. Number two, if you want to cut gang violence, then you have to address the idea of drug legalization. Since the overwhelming majority of gun violence are gun fights among gangs, but to these background checks, two points -- if they are so great, make them free, but if they cost anywhere from $60 to $100. The reason why they aren't free is because they feel that the price is a deterrent. But if it is a deterrent, that would only affect poor people because they can't afford the money. We're still gonna get our guns, we're gonna pay the piece. But lastly, John Lott put up this amazing study - two days ago. He -- it's a first-ever study of background checks, whether they reduced the risk of these mass public shootings. He looked from 2000 to 2015 and from that, additional checks on private transfers of guns raises the risk of these shootings, or of these deaths, rate of killing by 80 percent. So these background checks are actually harmful. This is what's called a --WILLIAMS: Well, explain.GUTFELD: It's called a hate fact. You hate to hear it because it's true.WILLIAMS: Well, what -- I don't get it, explain to me.GUTFELD: No, you just look it, ran the numbers.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: But how could that be?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Here's what happens. Because the cost of a background check, you're forcing more people who may not require a background check to know, require the background check. That cost goes immediately to the purchaser, right?GUTFELD: Yeah, right.BOLLING: Because the seller is not going to eat that cost, it's going to go to the purchaser. What happens to the purchaser? He says I don't want to pay that money for the background check, he's going to go it an illegal gun, or he's not gonna get a gun. So therefore, the crime against people in poverty, minorities, et cetera, goes up because of increased regulation of background checks.WILLIAMS: Why?BOLLING: That's the logic behind the --WILLIAMS: I think that's kind of convoluted. I mean, Greg --BOLLING: No --WILLIAMS: I mean I didn't understand what Greg said. But I just think that's kind of convoluted.BOLLING: Why is it convoluted?WILLIAMS: Because I think that --BOLLING: At cost to something, it's going to prohibit a certain group of people from -- and being able to afford buy it.WILLIAMS: Well, if can you afford to buy a gun. I think you can afford the $60 -- did you say $60, I don't know what the price is.BOLLING: Higher, but --GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: But $60 for a background checks.GUTFELD: Talking about (inaudible) I think.WILLIAMS: I think that Americans -- this is overwhelming. I don't get this. Republicans gun owners support background checks.GUTFELD: Hey, I'm from -- I'm for background checks, I hope they work. But I don't see the evidence that they work. By the way, homicides have been cut in half in 25 years, anyway with guns.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: And I talk about the political ramifications, the fall out of this, is this a good wedge issue for 2016?DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Well, I think the president thinks so, but -- couple of things, so his -- they have poll-tested this a lot. This is something he's been talking about ever since he was in the state senate in Illinois. So he knows the issue very well. Think what you saw today was just -- when he welled up with emotion. I went -- I recently heard a saying that you can't really know a man's heart until you know what can break it. And Obama hasn't been one that has shown a lot of these emotions, especially when it comes to tears. And so, that was a moment -- it's almost as if he made eye contact with somebody in the crowd who maybe has been affected by Sandy Hook and he knows those families. And I can't imagine what it would be like having been there, but it's not -- I wasn't the president. Where you walk in, you have to give the president bad news, like with Virginia Tech shooting, and I think 2007, when President Bush was in office. It does affect them because they take it a little bit personally. And that's what President Obama is doing, which is why I don't know exactly how the politics will come out, because making things personal doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to achieve anything. On a democratic side, it probably helps a little bit in some of those districts and states where you have democrats running for office that say that they want to be able to point to something that President Obama did on the issue that they care about, if it is guns. The interesting thing on the republican side, though, is that it could actually increase enthusiasm of republicans to turn out. One of the things I don't understand why the president didn't do this is he has the power to convene, and because there is bipartisan support on some of the issues when you look at the polling, he could have pulled together a bipartisan group and made the members stand up there with him, to say how are we going to deal with this if we can't find any sort of way on mental health or something.GUILFOYLE: Why do you think that didn't happen?PERINO: I think because he -- I think that he had such a dislike for members of Congress. And you remember the democratic Senate in 2013 -- he couldn't pass it.WILLIAMS: I was gonna, I was gonna raise. I was gonna raise that point.PERINO: When they had the democrats in office, either. So the politics.WILLIAMS: It support of your point.PERINO: The politics aren't exactly there. If I can just add one last thing -- it was reported that this new action, that the president wants to put forward, will require the FBI to hire about 230 more agents. Recently, the FBI has told us that we have open investigations about -- with ISIS in all 50 states. I would imagine the FBI director would much rather have 230 more full-time people to be able help prevent the San Bernardino's, that we know are probably coming and being plotted right now, than they would be to have them to do more background checks.WILLIAMS: But I think it is part of that story. I think if you have better background checks, you can stop some of the people who we talk about here in terms of terrorists and bad people from getting guns. And this also includes, and I would think this would add.BOLLING: But wait, do terrorists and bad people give background checks? Pay for background checks?WILLIAMS: Well, apparently, this guy got the guns from a friend, the guy in San Bernardino. And I think.BOLLING: Right, which wouldn't help.WILLIAMS: No, I think if they had done background checks, if they had insisted on really --GUTFELD: It didn't stop Aurora, it didn't stop Fort Hood.WILLIAMS: Didn't stop it, but I don't say let's not.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: The president said today, ""Let's not debate the last one. Let's talk about stopping the next one.""GUTFELD: Yeah, because if you debate the last one, you are wrong.GUILFOYLE: The fact those supporters.WILLIAMS: No.GUTFELD: But to go to the terror thing -- this is an interesting thing. Guns didn't make not those people kill San Bernardino innocents, radical Islam did. So the argument over the guns pulls them out of that. It's also with suicide. When he talks about suicide, you don't kill yourself because of a gun. You kill yourself with the gun.WILLIAMS: Yeah, but you know in fact.GUTFELD: You focus on, with the gun.WILLIAMS: You have easy access to the gun and more easily done.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Background checks will not stop suicides.WILLIAMS: No, no, no. Well, I'm just saying, what we don't want to aim for suicides.GUTFELD: Unless your doctor stops you.BOLLING: You know what a background checks are also doing?WILLIAMS: Tell me.BOLLING: You hate gun ownership.WILLIAMS: What?BOLLING: You hate the proliferation of gun ownership in America, right?WILLIAMS: Yeah. Oh, I said easy access.BOLLING: Numerous times you said 300 million guns.WILLIAMS: Yes.BOLLING: In America is too many.WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: You know what's happening with all these gun control talk? People are flocking to buy guns right now.WILLIAMS: That's true.BOLLING: Background checks -- 44 a minute in 2015, 44 background checks a minute in 2015.GUILFOYLE: It's like the best thing to happen to the gun lobby.BOLLING: To the gun lobby and gun owners.GUILFOYLE: It's like, hey, we're getting result --WILLIAMS: You know what they said.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, because people are worried about the gun curb.WILLIAMS: The gun lobby is exploiting --GUILFOYLE: And the infringement on the Second Amendment.WILLIAMS: There is no infringement. Even the NRA said today.GUILFOYLE: Ay yai yai.WILLIAMS: You mean after all of these years.BOLLING: Good transition.WILLIAMS: This is so thin.PERINO: That is.BOLLING: Good transition. The president also tore into the gun lobby and accused groups like the NRA of holding Congress hostage. Here's to see why there would be a divide over his proposals.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: But I also believe that we can find way to reduce gun violence consistent with the Second Amendment. How did this become such a partisan issue? Even the NRA used to support expanded background checks. And by the way, most of its members still do, most republican voters still do. How did we get here? How did we get to the place where people think requiring a comprehensive background check means taking away people's guns?(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: And then the NRA put out a statement following the speech saying the president's proposed actions will be, quote, ""ripe for abuse"" by his administration and won't allow gun-abiding -- gun, law-abiding gun owners to become scapegoats for his failed policies. Now there is a big -- when he said earlier in the sound bite.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: OK. He politicized this. He's the one -- no, not Juan. Juan, he brazenly said.WILLIAMS: Oh come on. This is it.GUTFELD: It's time, it's -- whenever there's a tragedy. You got to politicize this. But I'll give you -- I think we can meet on, in one mid- area, Juan, if you will.WILLIAMS: All right.GUTFELD: A lot of this is all about suspicion. The left is suspicion of -- suspicious of the right and the right is suspicious of the left. We don't trust President Obama. We think that every small step is leading to a bigger absolute thing like a ban. It's the same way the left feels about the right on abortion. That every little, every little twists or turn at the edges is going to lead to a reversal of Roe v. Wade.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: It's exactly a mirror. We don't trust each other. So that's why there's no bipartisanship on this stuff.WILLIAMS: Well, I think there's no bipartisanship because you have an NRA out there that has directly --GUTFELD: And you have Planned Parenthood. See my point?WILLIAMS: What?GUTFELD: They're the same, WILLIAMS: You think Planned Parenthood spends as much as the NRA? No. Not even close.GUTFELD: You know what I mean. I said this --WILLIAMS: Oh no, I get your point. I said -- OK.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: I do get your point. I hear you, but I'm just saying, I think the suspicion is a legitimate point you're making, but I don't think in terms of counting the money and the political power, I don't think it's even comparable. I will say this, talk about smart guns, why don't, why don't people come together on the idea that, yeah, we can have trigger that recognize people.GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: We can have chip ID's, we can do a lots of things that would in fact, lower it.BOLLING: All infringing on the Second Amendment right.WILLIAMS: Oh, stop.GUILFOYLE: I know, but I guess my point is.WILLIAMS: Of course, you can still own a gun.GUILFOYLE: Juan, what would you do?WILLIAMS: Yes?GUILFOYLE: You know you, and the individuals that have your same beliefs. What will you do when you get what you want, perhaps, someday and still the violence, the terrorism, the mass shootings, happen?WILLIAMS: I would say, well, we have a Second Amendment and the court has affirmed it, so we have to live. But I don't think we have this.GUILFOYLE: The problem is what their --WILLIAMS: To live in the dark ages.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: I wonder what's in the dark ages.WILLIAMS: Without smart guns, without improving the technology, without making an effort to keep them out of people.GUILFOYLE: That's not what we were talking. That's not what we were talking about.WILLIAMS: Keep us out of hands of people who shouldn't have them.BOLLING: All right, hang in there Juan.GUILFOYLE: They will get the guns.BOLLING: Final thought before we go.PERINO: Sure. I would say that remarkable -- this is fairly remarkable today that he had this big of an outpouring on the news on Thursday -- in two days. It's been a long week and it's only Tuesday. He's going to have the town hall and in Virginia, he's going to talk about this. So this is the lead-up to his State of the Union Address. The State of the Union is where you say, this is the State of the Union and these are my proposals and my ideas for the next 12 months, my last year in office. But this is at a time when less than 2 percent of people say that gun violence and ownership is their number one concern. Their number one concern is terrorism, ISIS and the economy, as it should be.BOLLING: Where is that town hall, Thursday?PERINO: Virginia.BOLLING: Very interesting, right?(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: All right, ahead. Special guests will be joining us, presidential candidate John Kasich is here. We're gonna ask him what he thinks about the president's latest push to restrict guns and how he plans to win the republican nomination, back in a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Welcome back to The Five, we are very pleased to welcome our republican presidential hopeful to our table now. Ohio Governor John Kasich is here with us, he's going live on the Five. And there's just 27 days left until the first election contest in Iowa. But he seems to be setting his sights on New Hampshire, where the first of the nation primary will be held on February 9th. He's been campaigning in the state all week and just released another new ad there today. Welcome to The Five.GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Thank you.GUILFOYLE: Pleasure to have you here, governor. So tell us about all your big plans and how you're going to wreck everybody else by getting the nomination.(LAUGHTER)KASICH: Well, you know here's the thing that's amazing about New Hampshire and you have followed it Dana, very closely. There's 1.2 million people in that state, it's like running for mayor of a -- you know, a basically a middle-sized city. And the 1.2 million, I've seen all of them twice, so I only have two more times to go.GUILFOYLE: There you go.KASICH: But the way it works is you go to your town hall meetings, of which I've done, 48 or nine right now. And you stand up in front, people ask you questions. And so it gets down, it's really interesting. It's like running for Congress in a way. You have your air, you know, your commercials and then you have a ground game. And then you pitch yourself and you see what happens. And we will not know what's going to happen in New Hampshire. I don't believe until election night.GUILFOYLE: All right.KASICH: Because we're all so bunched together and so close. And that's where I think the ground game will work. And we're very optimistic about it.GUILFOYLE: And town halls do matter there. Let's take a listen. You mentioned that new ad, let's roll that and we get everybody to react.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He lived a hard-scrabble of life in a rusty steel town. John Kasich never gives up. When he lost his parents to a drunk driver, he had the faith to carry on. Some say he couldn't balance the federal budget, but Kasich stunned Washington. They said he couldn't save Ohio from an $8 billion shortfall, but Kasich did. They say our best days are behind us. America never gives up -- John Kasich.KASICH: I'm Kohn Kasich and I approved this message.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Great message. I think you're hitting all the points there.KASICH: Well, look. I think the thing is people think the system is bad. Rich people, special interests run the country. And some people are feeling so that -- first of all, that's -- with some politicians may be true, with me, it isn't. I mean, my whole record is an example of speaking up for those people I grew up with in that hard-scrabble town, but we can't give up. I mean, I tell everybody, it says -- this morning I spoke to the, to people who were recovering drug addicts. I spoke to college students -- don't give up, you get knocked down, get back up. Look at his story, the life story of Juan Williams. How many times have you been knocked down, OK?GUTFELD: By me.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Just today.WILLIAMS: How about this today, all right.(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)KASICH: Increasingly, there are people that say, ""Well, you know, I -- maybe it's all over for me."" No, you can't give up.GUTFELD: But senator is scrabble really that hard?KASICH: Governor, not senator.GUTFELD: Governor.KASICH: Don't demote me now.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: I forget.KASICH: Yeah.GUTFELD: All governors -- all the governors are doing poorly in this race. Why do you think that is? Is it a function of an angry populace or?KASICH: Well, the last poll that came out had me one point out of second place and only, you know like eight points behind Trump, and that's before the voting starts. I do believe at the end of the day Greg, that the -- that experience matters. I mean, I think at the end of the day, people will settle down and they're going to want somebody who can land the plane. The key for me is I talk about experience only from the standpoint of giving me -- giving myself credibility to talk about what I want to do. Because you know, based on somebody's past record, what they're likely to do in the future. And I think people do want somebody to stand up for them. They want jobs. They want their kids to get work. They want the homeland protected. So when I say it, I feel as though I've got the credibility to say it based on what I've done throughout my career.BOLLING: Governor, you said at some point people will quote, ""settle down"" and they want someone to land the plane, I assume that means you. If they don't settle down and they choose Donald Trump to try and land the plane, would you accept the VP nomination by Donald Trump, a nod, a tap on your shoulder to be Donald Trump's VP?KASICH: Do you think I -- you don't know me very well, although I've been on the show and you -- do you think I would ever run for second place? I have the second-best job in the entire country.BOLLING: I understand that, but you're Ohio and you're -- and the GOP needs to deliver Ohio and a smart presidential nominee would want to deliver Ohio and you're the best way to do it.KASICH: How about the best way to beat Hillary Clinton is to pick me as the nominee, because I am in Ohio and because I'm very hard to label. I mean, of all -- it's always been difficult for people to put their finger on me. You know, we balance budgets. We grow the economy. We leave no one behind, whether you're mentally ill or drug addicted or the working poor, or a member of the minority community. You have a chance in Ohio. And I think it makes it very difficult for people to put -- to lay a glove on me. And with Hillary, Hillary is a measure. You know, Keystone pipeline. Well, do I make the unions mad or do I make the environmentalists mad? And Juan, I think that's her problem. Her problem is she's too political in deciding things. And I don't think that's what the country wants. And i don't think that's going to work in general election.WILLIAMS: Well, I -- you know, I respect you. I mean, I respected you from Washington, (inaudible). I respect tremendously what you've done in Ohio. You've reached out to lots of people in Ohio who back you. I'm talking about racial minorities, people you wouldn't associate with the republican brand like John Kasich. The question is, in this time, Greg touched on this of anger, an angry electorate. Are they going to turn to someone who's seen as an establishment figure?KASICH: Well, you know, Juan, it's kind of hard -- it has following me. You know it's pretty hard to label me as an establishment figure, because I've always fought the establishment.WILLIAMS: That's true.KASICH: But this may be where we are now. And here's what some people say. Well, Trump says all the things that I wish I could say and I can't. Well, let me tell you. If we're a country that is devolving into name-calling and insulting, we got bigger problems than who we're going to elect for president. So what do I think? Hope springs eternal with me. I've been in politics a long time, I've studied it for a long time and I think at the end of the day, people do settle down.WILLIAMS: Well, say something angry.KASICH: I'm not going to change myself, Juan. Because you know what, if I win, I want to fix the country. I'm not going to say things to get elected and then I'm there and like, OK, now what do we do? Forget it. I'm not going there.GUILFOYLE: Spoken like the grown-up at the table.GUTFELD: Hey.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: I was so brilliant.GUILFOYLE: That's right, yeah, I mean.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: I was so brilliant.GUILFOYLE: This is like going to be a deep tease, because you're going to hear from Dana Perino, she's got questions. But the governor said don't go away, he's staying with us. We're going to keep him. We're going to ask him what he thinks about Bill Clinton's debut on the campaign trial for Hillary this week. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: We're back with presidential candidate and Ohio Governor John Kasich. We want to ask him about the democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton. Yesterday, her husband, Bill, started hitting the campaign trail for her. The mainstream media hailed it as a major moment.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today, it was decisive moment for the first time this campaign on trail.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hillary Clinton who today deployed one of her most potent political weapons.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The man she calls both husband and her not so secret weapon has been launched on the campaign trail.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can Hillary win this one?BILL CLINTON, FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: Win here? Sure. But it's going to be hard.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Back in his element.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: So we want -- do a quick thing about the Clintons. You dealt with the Clintons in the past. I mean, you were a budget chairman and other places. And what do you think about how you could beat them?KASICH: Well, you beat Hillary, because I think she's really compartmentalized. I don't think she thinks in terms -- she doesn't have a great vision. And I think that's what -- that's why Obama beat her, I think, because it's about vision.It's like remember I used to talk about Bush; it's the vision thing. And I don't think she has a vision. I think it's too much politically calculated.Now, if we come out with somebody who's a divider, that can't win Ohio. If you don't win Ohio, you can't be president. It's not that complicated.PERINO: I'm going to exercise my right to have one more question.KASICH: Yes. Yes, good.PERINO: I didn't in the last one. Tell me about Ohio. That is -- that's actually quite a remarkable story. Where you started as governor and where are you today. You're up, you said, 385,000 jobs?KASICH: Well, we're up 385,000 jobs. Our wages are growing faster than the national average. Our credit is rock-solid. Our pensions are rock solid. We've cut taxes by the largest of any sitting governor, $5 billion. We're running a $2 billion surplus, and we're leaving nobody in the shadows. I mean, we're lifting everybody. It's a remarkable story. And the state has been economically diversified.PERINO: And can that be replicated or duplicated on a national level?KASICH: Oh, yes. Well, remember, I was chairman of the budget committee when we actually balanced the budget. We cut capital gains, and the economy was booming.And there are people running now -- it's sort of funny. We've got guys running, for seven years we heard people say how did we ever elect a first- term senator who didn't have the experience? I think maybe we have amnesia.And then one of my, one of the guys running, one of the governors, I mean, he -- you know, his -- his budget is structurally out of balance. He's -- his pensions are falling apart. He's been downgraded nine times. I mean, that -- you have to look at that.WILLIAMS: You're taking a shot at Chris Christie, and you won't even call him his name?KASICH: No. No, you're so smart, Juan, I want to you figure it out.WILLIAMS: Oh, thank you.KASICH: What I'm saying is it is a heck of a record. But it's not a record, because, you know, frankly, I'm such a great guy. I've got a great team, and that's how you do things. You know this from your time in the White House. You have to have a great team. You have to let them be set free.And here's the key. Look at a problem and fix it. Don't worry about politics. Don't worry about who's going to yell at you. Don't care about the rich or the powerful. Who cares? Look at a problem, fix it. Because at the end that's what your legacy is about.GUTFELD: So I'm thinking that Hillary is a big problem solver. She's got Bill on the trail to keep him off the tail.Is it weird...PERINO: You don't have to answer that.GUTFELD: Is it weird, Governor, that we have a socialist running for president and Bernie Sanders?GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.KASICH: Look, I mean, what do you want me to say to that?GUTFELD: Anything you want. OK, national security, I think it's the most important issue of the day.KASICH: Yes. It is very important.GUTFELD: What would be your plan, if you were president, to deal with ISIS?KASICH: Well, look, I was -- served on the defense committee for 18 years. And when, after 9/11 I went to the Pentagon and for two or three years I was involved with bringing technologists into the Pentagon to solve some of the problems, working directly with Donald Rumsfeld.The answer is, you have to have an air and a ground, and you have to destroy them. And it has to be a coalition very much like the first Bush had. And you've got to give the first Bush a lot of credit. Because when they pushed Saddam out of Kuwait and they started marching, people say he should have gone all the way to Baghdad. He was smart enough to get out of there and not get us in the middle of a civil war.And it's a tragedy that the intelligence was bad on Iraq. Because without that intelligence about nuclear weapons, no way we should have gone in there. Because when the U.S. involves itself in civil wars directly, we don't win. We lose.WILLIAMS: Can we just get nitty-gritty on politics for a second?KASICH: Yes.WILLIAMS: You're not spending a lot of time in Iowa.KASICH: I'm spending more time there. I was just there yesterday.WILLIAMS: Not as compared to...KASICH: No, no.WILLIAMS: ... Cruz and Trump and those guys.KASICH: Because of the size, Juan. I mean, Iowa is so big, and there's only so many resources and so many hours in the day.WILLIAMS: I thought it was about the evangelical Christian Republicans and you decided, you know, ""That's not my market.""KASICH: Well, look, I'm a man of faith, so -- but I don't go out, you know, like wearing it on my sleeve.WILLIAMS: Right, right.KASICH: No, it wasn't for that at all. It's a matter of resources and time. I mean, I only got in in July. So you know, you should have been in...GUILFOYLE: You have to allocate your resources.KASICH: Right. And look, it's a lot easier when you have 1.2 million. I can stand in Manchester, throw a stone and hit most of New Hampshire. So - - but we're on the ballot now in over 30 states. We have people in South Carolina, people in Iowa, people in Nevada. This is an untold story.And the ad I put up today is from the hard dollars of my campaign.WILLIAMS: Goodness.KASICH: People said, ""He's going to run out of money. He's not going to do this; he's not going to do that."" We're like the Little Engine that Can, and here's the key. If the ground game doesn't work, then you know, we're not going to do well in New Hampshire. If we don't do well in New Hampshire, well enough to continue, I'm not going to drag this thing on. I mean, I'm not in this to, you know, write a book or get a television show or anything else.But I believe we're going to...PERINO: Been there, done that.KASICH: I believe we're going to come out of New Hampshire as a story. And if that's the case, I'm going to tell you, I will come back. Because I believe I'll be the nominee.BOLLING: Because the money will come in?KASICH: Money will come in, and we're organized everywhere.BOLLING: You are one of the -- you are very likable. You're very personable; you're very relatable. People love to talk to you. Why is it not resonating with the voters right now?KASICH: Again, the last poll before Christmas, you know, the independent poll, a sample of 600, which Dana will tell you, is -- it's a good number. It's got a lower error rate. I'm one point behind Rubio and only a few points behind Trump. We'll see where it goes.GUILFOYLE: There's plenty of time.KASICH: But -- and here's the thing. We're not going to know until election day. I mean, you -- these things change up there. It's so volatile. And the public, for the first time, when I was in Iowa and now in New Hampshire, you know what I've noticed? People now are starting to really listen. Up until now, there's been limited focus, in my opinion.And look, I'm not spinning you. If I thought we were going to do well, I'd tell you. Are we going to win Iowa? Of course not. We're not going to do that. But we're going to put enough time in, hopefully, to have a decent finish. But the key is coming out of New Hampshire. But we're ready to move on if we come out of New Hampshire.GUILFOYLE: You know whose attention you got from day one who was very worried about you and still is? Not just based on your record, but Ohio, the whole package, was the Clinton campaign.PERINO: True.GUILFOYLE: They're worried about running against you.KASICH: Well, you know, what are they going to -- what are they going to use against me? I've got nothing but a record of growth, of inclusion, of lifting people. Of you know, just being a regular guy. And I think it's hard to put me in a box. And I think that might be part of my problem.GUILFOYLE: You could get Democrats to cross over and have that Reagan appeal.KASICH: Well, I won 86 out of 88 counties in Ohio. I had 60 percent of women vote, 26 percent of African-Americans, and 51 percent of union households. After all the issues I have with organized labor, I mean, I was endorsed by the building trades, the operating engineers, the carpenters. Nailed that one, by the way. Get it? Get it?PERINO: All right. On that note, we're going to have to go.KASICH: All right.PERINO: Thank you so much for joining us.KASICH: Thank you.PERINO: It was really fun.Next, will a new movie on the attack in Benghazi impact Hillary Clinton's race for the White House? We're going to show you a clip ahead.GUTFELD: Ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: As the new movie on Benghazi comes out, remember this: On September 14, 2012, at Andrews Air Force Base, Hillary Clinton told the family members of the men killed in Benghazi that their deaths were sparked by a video. Four relatives claim she actually did say this. And Tyrone Woods' dad actually made notes after she talked to them. This is key.Remember when just weeks ago, George Stephanopoulos asked her this:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS: Did you tell them it was about the film? And what's your response?HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: No. You know, look, I understand the continuing grief at the loss that parents experienced with the loss of these four brave Americans. And I did testify, as you know, for 11 hours. And I answered all of these questions. Now I can't, I can't help it, that the people think there has to be something else there.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Well, that does it for me. She's telling the truth and those families are liars.I mean, who are you going to believe? Some grieving people, including one who took notes? Or some heroic woman who braved sniper fire in Bosnia? Do you trust some dead heroes' relatives or a lady who said she was dead broke after the White House? Who would you accept, the word of people with precise memories of that event, or a person who blamed a planned act of terror on a video? Who are you going to believe, weeping parents, or the person who said she was named after Sir Edmund Hillary, even though he didn't get famous until she was 6 years old. That makes no sense.And never mind that what these families said are the same things that Hillary had said openly, as well as her flacks did on other shows. See, it's not like Hillary ever lies about anything. She lies about everything. She lies the way a puppy poops: often and everywhere. And it's the press that scrub it off, on their hands and knees.But in the end, it's just her words against theirs. As loved ones lie in state, she simply lies.So on Megyn Kelly last night, here were some relatives responding to the accusations of -- oh, the contractors, OK, about lying about the video. Go for it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I know Pat Smith. I know Katie Quigley, Gwen's sister. I know -- you know, we know Ty's mom. We know what they told us was said, and I do know them very well. And Katie is -- Katie has been on the news quite a bit, telling you what she was told.And I know that they were told it was the video, because that's what they told me. And I believe Pat. I believe Katie. I believe Ty -- Charles Woods.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean, who would have a reason to lie? Why? Their loved ones just died.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's simple.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Exactly.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They have no reason to tell anything but the truth.GUTFELD: Kimberly, this is a huge deal.GUILFOYLE: It's a really big deal, and it should matter. I want it to matter.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Because it tells me a lot about this country, about the voters, about American families, about the values that we hold dear. Make a choice with confidence and say someone who lies like this, lies to grieving family members. Listen to what these guys have said. They've been very consistent from day one, coming out to talk about it. A movie coming out, this special. I mean, there's even much more to this story than we're even hearing at this point.GUTFELD: Yes. Eric.GUILFOYLE: There's a lot of people's lives on the line.GUTFELD: The media is going to let this slide, right?BOLLING: Yes. They keep -- they point the finger at us, saying FOX or the right is rehashing this; she's already testified for 11 hours. Don't forget, she -- we already have emails unearthed now of her emailing...GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: ... her daughter, Chelsea, saying within 24 hours, saying, ""This is terror.""GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: This is a terror attack. And then, as you know, a couple of days later, two days after the email. Two days after the email, three days after the attack, she says at Andrews, says -- mentions the video. I mean, that's all you -- there's your smoking gun.I don't know why this is up for any other discussion. She blatantly lied about it. And we need to keep harping on this, because it matters.GUTFELD: What else -- and what else could she lie about, Dana? If you lie about this, why can't you just admit you made -- if she admits she made a mistake she's a better person.PERINO: The other thing is that she does this thing where she tries to absolve herself from any responsibility by saying how long she testified. So the book -- the movie is called ""13 Hours,"" which is based on the best- selling book by the same name. Thirteen hours, it was a lot harder to do what they did for 13 hours, than it was for her to answer questions for 11 hours.GUTFELD: Great point.PERINO: Answering 11 hours' worth of question doesn't mean that you've absolved yourself, if there are still these contradictions.GUTFELD: That is an excellent point.PERINO: Thank you.GUTFELD: Juan, you know, she's the type of person who would day an orphan's candy, eat it in front of the orphan, and then blame it on a video.WILLIAMS: And blame it on the video? That's...GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: And then have the guy arrested.GUTFELD: And then have the guy arrested.WILLIAMS: Look, this, to me, Kimberly says she wants to believe this. You guys want this to be important. I think for most Americans it's like, what are you talking about?PERINO: I think there are some Democrats.WILLIAMS: She's testified. This thing has been over. It's over.GUILFOYLE: No, no, no. No, no, no. She testi-lies. She testi-lies.WILLIAMS: Whatever. But I'm just saying, this has been gone over and over. People have said, you know, did she say this? Did she not? I mean, at this point...(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: ... the lies.WILLIAMS: I know what difference it makes, because Kimberly and you guys want to believe this.GUTFELD: All right. OK.PERINO: We're just looking at... GUILFOYLE: It should matter. Lies should matter. I mean, why -- lying, is that part of the job qualification for secretary of state? Does she think that's a resume builder for commander-in-chief? I don't think so.GUTFELD: Well, apparently she does, and we've got to move. Ahead a group that's trying to get people to cut back on their alcohol intake -- oooh -- has issued a month-long no drinking challenge. Could we do it? Next.PERINO: No.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: It's the new year and a time when a lot of folks regroup to kick certain vices. Like smoking, overeating or -- perhaps drinking too much? Do you think you could give up having a glass of wine or a cocktail for an entire month? A group called Alcohol Concern is encouraging people to sign up for their no-drinking challenge. And they've dubbed it Dry January.So before this moment, before this segment I said at the table who's the heaviest drinker at the table? And there was a contest...PERINO: That's commercial break talk.WILLIAMS: Yes. And so there was a contest -- I'm breaking the rules here. So there was a contest. And the contest was between my two male colleagues. And so I say Dr. Gutfeld and Dr. Bolling, why don't you two settle this? Who is the heaviest drinker between the two of you?BOLLING: Is that what the segment is?PERINO: I wasn't prepared for that.WILLIAMS: I want to establish this.PERINO: I wasn't prepared for that.WILLIAMS: I want to establish this so I can ask the question.BOLLING: I'll pull a Juan Williams on this. So I think I could possibly not drink for a full month of the month of January, but why would I? I don't want to not drink for the month of January. I enjoy a cocktail or two or three.WILLIAMS: But you could prove -- you could prove that you could do it.PERINO: No. He has amazing willpower. He hasn't eaten on Tuesdays for years.WILLIAMS: What?GUILFOYLE: No. He's totally manorexic now. He doesn't eat.BOLLING: I haven't -- I haven't eaten meat in 24 years. So I could do that.PERINO: He's got will power.BOLLING: But I could go -- that's the one thing I don't want to do.WILLIAMS: Greg.GUTFELD: If you can find a cure for boredom, stress, anxiety, crankiness, I'll stop drinking. I am so neurotic -- and I'm not kidding -- that I bought a book on parallel universes, and I worry about myself in those other universes. I'm wondering, like, is Greg Gutfeld in a car accident in this other universe? Is Greg Gutfeld going to be fired in this universe?GUILFOYLE: Probably.GUTFELD: I have so much anxiety I can't even keep it in our universe. Drink away, America.WILLIAMS: Drink away. Well, what do you say, Kimberly?GUILFOYLE: Keep it up, little peanut pinot noir.GUTFELD: Better than to call me something else.WILLIAMS: Hey, hey, hey. Slow down, slow down.GUILFOYLE: I'll tell you, I'm going to out the whole table. Ready? OK. No. 1 is seven vodkas is Bolling. No. 2 drinker is pinot noir there. Three, Dana. K.G. I don't know where you fall. I don't know where you fall in. Are you...WILLIAMS: I don't fall in, I fall down. If I have too much to drink, I fall down.GUILFOYLE: He has some other, you know, vices. Dana is like, packs quite a punch. She's like...WILLIAMS: Dana quacks a punch?GUILFOYLE: Packs. Packs, because she's tiny.PERINO: Are we talking -- if it's relative to our size, do I drink the most?WILLIAMS: That's a good question.GUTFELD: I thought you downed that bottle of Everclear in the bathroom before the show.WILLIAMS: Everclear. Anyway...PERINO: Zima.BOLLING: Don't leave your own drinking out of the equation.GUILFOYLE: No, no. I was putting myself maybe just right before Juan.WILLIAMS: All right. Well, there's no evidence, by the way, that this works, it does anything. But the lady who wrote it said it cleared up her face, her complexion. Anyway, ""One More Thing,"" coming up next.GUILFOYLE: Skin looks pretty good from here.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: Time for ""One More Thing."" Got to go fast. Juan, you're first.WILLIAMS: Well, it's the end of an era. The 15th and final season of ""American Idol"" premieres Wednesday night. Keith Urban, Jennifer Lopez, Harry Connick are returning along with Ryan Seacrest, the shows made stars of Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood and everybody watched. This was mainstream America. This was the time, this was one show everybody -- my wife, Delice, the kids, friends would come over. They loved it.Here's Jennifer Lopez on ""The Today Show"" this morning.GUILFOYLE: This is why, because you like J. Lo.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JENNIFER LOPEZ, JUDGE, ""AMERICAN IDOL"": I had a moment where I really realized, like, wow, this is it. This is over. It's been a big part of my life. And a very special part of my life.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: We're going to miss that show.BOLLING: All right, Greg, you're up.GUTFELD: She owes me money.WILLIAMS: She owes you money?GUTFELD: A lot of money. We'll talk, J. Lo. You know what I'm talking about. Anyway...GUILFOYLE: You should pay her.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Greg's Math Question of the Day.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: People love math, but they forget about it after school. So here's the question for everybody here. What is the percentage of odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, among natural numbers? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8? What is the percentage of odd numbers among natural numbers?BOLLING: Fifty.GUTFELD: Fifty percent?BOLLING: Zero? Is zero a natural number?PERINO: I already know the answer.GUILFOYLE: You're reading off the...GUTFELD: I thought 50 percent. But they're exactly the same amount as odd numbers as there are natural numbers, because they go to infinity.GUILFOYLE: OK. Wow.PERINO: Coming from the book.BOLLING: I think that's incorrect.GUTFELD: That's true.BOLLING: You can't push back on that.GUILFOYLE: I think you should go back to ""I Hate Those People."" It's more natural to you.GUTFELD: Viewers at home know what I'm talking about.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.PERINO: So this is how you know the world is going to H-E double hockey sticks in a handbasket.GUTFELD: Did you just say that?PERINO: I did, because -- you already know that celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Adam Levine, they have their own fragrances, right, that you can go in the store and you can buy them.GUTFELD: It's called Stink.PERINO: But in Russia, you can now buy a fragrance inspired by Russian President Vladimir Putin. That's right. It is called Leaders. What was it called, Leaders No. 1.GUTFELD: It's called Pew-tin.PERINO: It is not an aggressive scent. It's attractive, matter of fact and natural. So I mean, if things aren't going well for you on the campaign trail, folks, you might want to give this a shot.BOLLING: You know what it smells like? It smells like sweat.Kimmy G.GUILFOYLE: I know. I love the smell of this. Can you smell this through the TV? It's the smell of delicious bacon. I'm about to eat it all. You know who else loves bacon? This little one. Take a look. This is a viral video going around: 19-month-old Easton Beach may love bacon as much as me. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)EASTON BEACH, 19 MONTHS OLD: Bacon! Bacon!(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: I hear you. I feel you! Once you take a bite, once you eat bacon, you can't go back.BOLLING: I'm going to forgo my time, K.G., and I'm going to snatch at that for everyone who wants to check out the bacon behind the scenes.That's it for us.

5	5	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/11/11/candidates-draw-clear-lines-on-immigration-at-gop-debate/	Candidates draw clear lines on immigration at GOP debate	"This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" November 11, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Eric Bolling, along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld is back. It is 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five.""Today is Veterans Day. ""The Five"" salutes our brave heroes who served this nation. We are gonna talk about our vets ahead, but first to last night's big GOP debate. Fox Business crushed it. Over 14 million viewers tuned in to see Neil, Maria and Gerard ask real questions, not gotcha questions. Lots to get to, so let's start with one of the hottest topics of the night, immigration, clear lines were drawn. On one side, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz with a conservative hardline stance, on the other, Jeb Bush and John Kasich with what some might call a considered path to amnesty.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are a country of laws. We need borders. We will have a wall, the wall will be built, the wall will be successful, and if you think walls don't work all you have to do is ask Israel. The wall works, believe me, properly done.GOV. JOHN KASICH, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Come on, folks, we all know you can't pick them up and ship them across, back across the border. It's a silly argument.SEN. TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Every sovereign nation secures its borders. And it is not compassionate to say we're not going to enforce the laws and we're going to drive down the wages for millions of hard-working men and women.GOV. JEB BUSH, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Twelve million illegal immigrants, to send them back, 500,000 a month is just -- not possible. And it's not embracing American values. And it would tear communities apart.(END VIDEO CLIPS)BOLLING: All right, Kimberly. Let's start with you. Your thoughts on, A, the immigration debate, B, who you thought did well last night?KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: You know, I think everybody had a pretty good night. I mean, the only person I saw was being too frustrated and came off like probably not at his best, at his game was Kasich, and I think he's very frustrated with the situation, also he didn't get enough time et cetera. However, everybody else I think basically stayed true to their core ideology, to the message that they wanted to get across. Carson, even in the wake of all the different incidents and news items that have come forward, I think he gave good explanations and was pretty steady. I think he probably exceeded expectations for what they were for him this week. I think Jeb Bush had a good night. I really do. I think he was very consistent in his message. He was very honest by saying he doesn't speak in sound bites, but he stuck to his record saying that he has a proven record in business for 30 years and as a governor with a successful record, to create jobs and taxes. The immigration issue was a little bit tricky, but I don't see that they were calling for amnesty. I think they're saying we have to do this in a way that is going to keep families together and in the true principles of America. So that's the way I saw it. And Rubio and Cruz, I thought were fantastic.BOLLING: Gotcha. OK, Greg, the overall general consensus, your feelings on the candidates and/or this topic?GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Exactly what Kimberly said, I think the real winner here was the Cuban sandwich. You had the hawkish Rubio, you had the red meat Ted and together they represent two key elements of the party. And I thought that they were the most articulate on their respective sides. I also think Ted Cruz wins when he talks as oppose to orate. When he starts to lecture, his voice goes up and drives me crazy, but when he talks, he's great. But the real winner is the public who watched this debate. I mean, when you compare this to CNBC, it's like going from Motel 6 to the Four Seasons. It made the CNBC debate look like a dunking tank for dorks, because the questions were very specific. At times they were dry, but the fact is it's the boring stuff that get kills you. And I thought they get a really good job. But I think the people of Missouri -- this is what the First Amendment is like. Could you imagine an activist from Missouri or a professor from Missouri being on that stage? They would have crumbled. They would need a body pillow to hug. They would need a safe space because that actually is how politics works, and how republicans -- republicans doing a better job than democrats.BOLLING: And to prove Greg's point. If you look at the quarter hours, Dana, each quarter, it grew. Quarter grew, quarter grew. It peaked to around, I believe around 10:15 or so. There's an hour and 15 minutes into the debate. People were coming to see what was going on. And at times, there was a bit dry, but so what, people want to hear this stuff.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: And I also thought that the follow-up questions were very pointed and targeted and it actually drew the candidates out even more, so that you know, you can kind of have your canned answer, but the follow-up question is always the place usually where someone can either shine or falter. I do think that everyone did very well. Interesting on the immigration side of things, there clearly is a lot of discussion going on -- within the party. The biggest applause line last night that Kasich got happened to be when he was talking about immigration of all things. So there is this split. I couldn't help but think, what, if you're Hillary Clinton's camp and you're watching this, how do you figure out a way to talk about immigration in a way that will be productive for her, in a general election? Republicans know what their challenges are in a general election on immigration, but for her, I actually think it is difficult for her to figure out how she is going to do it because she can't go a straight leftist play, people are concerned. The other thing on this topic that's very frustrating, and I spent a good part of the day looking at, also to different studies and data is that no one is working from the same set of facts. The questions about facts on wages are actually -- it's just there's no -- nobody is saying, OK, here's the definitive study that we can at least all agree on, that we can then argue from there. There's stuff all over the map. And so the business community, there are people that want to restrict immigration more. I think they would do themselves a favor if they could get together and decide on a set of metrics that we could all then have an actual debate about.BOLLING: Hey, Juan. I gave Rubio and Cruz A's. I gave Trump, Carson, Carly Fiorina and Rand Paul B's. I gave Jeb and Kasich C's only because of their bank that they allowed questions that they couldn't answer, wouldn't answer -- do you see it differently?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: You know I like the way you did. In fact, today, I read something and said that Jeb Bush needed an A-plus performance, but he got a passing grade. That's what you just gave Jeb Bush, a passing grade of C. I thought that he started off strong. I like the passion with which he spoke about the immigration issue. But after that it felt like he sort of disappeared, does that he little back-and-forth with Trump, you know and, but I just don't see -- I was -- I thought that stood out to me big-time.BOLLING: Carson?WILLIAMS: Carson, I thought got a pass from his peers. There was the opportunity for them to jump him. There was the opportunity for people to say something about Rubio and his issues, nothing like that.PERINO: That was true all night.WILLIAMS: Yes. So I don't -- so I -- and also.GUTFELD: And because they found out.GUILFOYLE: And today.GUTFELD: The stories about his violence were true.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: That could be. Yeah, that's true.GUILFOYLE: They were afraid.GUTFELD: They're like, where cable steer clear.WILLIAMS: Yeah. I tried.GUILFOYLE: They're afraid of that in Iowa.GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: Backlash.WILLIAMS: I tried the tough black guy thing on this set, but it doesn't work and it doesn't matter.GUTFELD: Just makes you sensitive.WILLIAMS: I know.BOLLING: There's (inaudible) time.GUILFOYLE: That doesn't work when you sit next to a Puerto Rican woman.WILLIAMS: Well, yeah, I'm so lucky.GUILFOYLE: They're more scared of me.WILLIAMS: Yes. But I got to tell you. I mean, there are some things that did about me -- you were talking about metrics. Trump says wages are too high. Wait a minute, I didn't -- that's not great stuff for to say to an audience who says that economic anxiety is one of their principle concerns. And then the second part was who is really a conservative. I love the debate between Cruz and Rubio.BOLLING: All right. We got to move on to this one. If you're playing a drinking game, rule number one, do a shot every time you hear the phrase big government, you got drunk. Check it out.(LAUGHTER)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)CARLY FIORINA, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This isn't about just replacing a democrat with a republican now. It's about actually challenging the status quo of big government. Big government has created a big business called politics.SEN. RAND PAUL, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I want a government really, really small so small you can barely see it. So I want lower taxes and much more money in the private sector.(APPLAUSE)GOV. BOBBY JINDAL, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We have a fundamental choice to make folks. Are we willing to cut the government economy so we can grow the American economy? That is the most fundamental question we've got to answer, we're on the path to socialism right now.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: The biggest lie in all of Washington and in all of politics is that republicans are the party of the rich. The truth is the rich do great with big government.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Dana?PERINO: I think that Ted Cruz had a really, really good debate. And I think they all benefitted from having a slightly smaller number of -- a fewer people on the stage, that there was eight, instead of ten and that gave them all a little bit more time. And I find -- I think that they finally are starting to make the case definitive case for their candidacy, and you saw Carly Fiorina and Rubio both did this, where they were finally zeroing in on. What I've been thinking, we've all been talking about, this anxiety that people feel, especially mothers. So this is where you've seen people saying that the country is on the wrong track, at 72 percent in the Pew and Gallup poll recently, 72 percent of people think the country is on the wrong track. But when you drove down a little bit, mothers and fathers, but mostly mothers will say, I worry about the future for my children.GUILFOYLE: Exactly.PERINO: And I -- the one thing I think that they have -- they don't go to the next step to say, it's not just immigration as a problem or energy as a problem. I don't think that they made the case that they -- none of them made the case, so they understand the economy and how complex it is and what actually needs to be done in a wholehearted way or in a holistic way. They have an opportunity to do that in the next two weeks and they need to.BOLLING: Greg, do you think anyone made the case that they were really in favor of smaller government? And how they were going to do it?GUTFELD: This is the problem with the idea of small government because it doesn't exist anymore. We have to stop lying to ourselves. You know, as conservatives and libertarians, we talk about small government. It's over. Now it's just about trying to keep the thing in a cage. Or trying to figure out a way when they're spending your money, how to spend it. So if I am now embracing big government, I want big military. I want big bombs and big tanks and I want big power. I don't -- if we're going to spend, let's spend. By the way, I forgot to -- Kasich was absolutely awful last night. I don't know if we're going to talk about that later, but he reminds me of the guy that's in front of you when you're trying to check in to the hotel room, and he's complaining about the showerhead. And you're just tired, but he won't stop complaining. And everybody just sitting there going, would you please shut up.BOLLING: But do you realize what he did about three-quarters away through the debate? When Ted Cruz asked him about bank bailouts, are you there or not? And he said, ""No."" Or what you gonna do? And then Kasich said, ""What about all those depositors?""GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: ""Individual depositors?"" And Cruz said, ""What you gonna do?"" And Kasich -- I think he blew his whole candidacy up in one line when he said, ""Well, we'll figure out who can afford it and who can't."" I mean, if that, that is a liberal talking point.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Straight down the middle.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, that's what it sounds like. That's their lingo. I don't think.PERINO: I don't like that exchange, though. Because I feel like none of that -- nobody --- you actually don't know -- you can't predict exactly what decision you're going to make before you walk into the Oval Office. You can talk about a set of principles, but until you're presented with all of the facts and have a chance to deliberate those, you don't really know. I do think, though, he did say one thing that he could stick to and I said people are going to love this and they did. When Ted Cruz said that he would veto any legislation that didn't also apply to members of Congress?BOLLING: Yeah, yeah.PERINO: Huge applause and I think in the Frank Luntz focus group that was like a 96 percent. That was a really smart good thing to say, something you could actually stick to.WILLIAMS: But I just thought, if you're a democrat watching this last night, you said, you know what, I see these large lines of division among republicans. We can talk about immigration and I think if you were, with the Hillary Clinton campaign, yes, you were laughing because guess what, unlike your position, Dana, I think it doesn't take a lot for the democrats to say we are much more pro immigrant than any of these republicans.PERINO: No, I'm not saying it, but that's -- do you think that necessarily helps them.WILLIAMS: Yes.PERINO: All the way in the general election?WILLIAMS: Yeah. You're just talking about.PERINO: It might.WILLIAMS: A republican base and the republican primary.PERINO: No. I'm talking about the general -- I know, I actually, I think it's bigger than that one. I do think -- I don't think this is just an R&D issue.WILLIAMS: I think it is.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: We shall see.BOLLING: Stay right there because we have one more topic I want to get to. They -- when they weren't taking swipes at each other, some candidates focused their fire at the democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton and that tactic -- pretty effective.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I want to talk about what's going to happen to this country if we have another four years of Barack Obama's policies. And by the way, it will be even worse because Hillary Clinton is running so far to the left to try to catch up to her socialist opponent, Bernie Sanders. It's hard to even see her anymore.BUSH: Hillary Clinton has said that Barack Obama's policies get an A, really? One in ten people right now aren't working or have given up altogether, as you've said, that's not an A. One in seven people are living in poverty, that's not an A. One in five children is on food stamp. That is not an A. It may be the best that Hillary Clinton can do, but it's not the best America can do.SEN. MARCO RUBIO, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than starting. And around the world, every day brings news of a new humiliation for America. Many, the direct respond -- the direct consequence of decisions made when Hillary Clinton was the secretary of the united -- of state.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: All right, K.G., you called that.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. Yesterday, I said listen, leg sweep Hillary, pant suit and all, that's what you have to do. Have a -- you know, move on target, that's the mission objective. Quick trying to eat each other's arms and legs off, and just focus on her because that's when you look presidential, you sound presidential. I think Christie crushed it last night. He sounded presidential, he looked and acted like he wanted the job and he was prepared, I was very impressed with that. And you know, I also thought that Ben Carson had good lines when he was talking about calling, ""that's what we call a lie where I come from."" About Hillary Clinton and lying about Benghazi, telling her daughter Chelsea something and the American people something else. And Jeb, I think was very strong on focusing on Hillary Clinton and tying her to Barack Obama and making the case strongly that a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for someone to the left of Barack Obama and the country can't afford that. That's the case. That's what needs to be set.BOLLING: Juan, did Hillary have a good debate or a bad debate last night?WILLIAMS: She had a great debate. Are you kidding me? I'm listening to you and I'm thinking, boy, look at this, premature hating on Hillary.GUILFOYLE: What do you mean?WILLIAMS: Because you don't even have a candidate.GUILFOYLE: Oh, please.WILLIAMS: You don't have anybody that's unifying the republican debate.GUILFOYLE: Now you're being silly. You know I'm right.WILLIAMS: No. I'm being serious.GUILFOYLE: Now this is silly.WILLIAMS: You don't have -- right now, I think it's Ben Carson and Donald Trump have about 50 percent, right? OK.BOLLING: Sure.WILLIAMS: That's it. But other than that, in this large field, with this 14 or 15 candidates right now.BOLLING: Fourteen, fourteen.WILLIAMS: It's splintered, Kimberly. It's thoroughly splintered.GUTFELD: Yeah, but.WILLIAMS: And there's no sense of.PERINO: But she's talking about on the merits.GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: She's not talking -- of course there's gonna be.WILLIAMS: What is it?PERINO: She's talking about the merits.WILLIAMS: Go ahead. What merits?PERINO: Of Hillary Clinton's policy. She's saying they're not good.WILLIAMS: Look, I think.PERINO: You can argue that point. The point you -- you're actually arguing something that she's not saying.WILLIAMS: You know what? Eric, why does she keep interrupting me?GUILFOYLE: Thank you for the U.N. .(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: Why does she keep interrupting me?GUILFOYLE: She's trying to help you.WILLIAMS: Now he's going to interrupt me.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Hillary has not come to this close to this kind of mature, political vetting. You maybe you have 15 candidates up there, but at least we all know what we're getting into, unlike 2008, where nobody kicked Obama's tires.WILLIAMS: Well I think this came across as a republican echo chamber on Hillary. Oh, she's terrible. But you know what? The wild witch of the west is flying in.GUILFOYLE: Come on, Juan.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: You know, don't be politically naive.PERINO: You said it.(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: And you say we cut you off, Juan.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: We got to go.GUILFOYLE: Give him the little cow bell.BOLLING: Much more to come on last night's debate, ahead. Including one of the most tense exchanges of the night, but before we go, a big hat-tip to the moderators of both debates yesterday. They did an outstanding job. Trish Regan, Sandra Smith and Gerald Seib of the Wall Street Journal, along with Neil Cavuto, Maria Bartiromo and the Journal's Gerard Baker. We'll be back in just a minute.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Oh, the commercial breaks, they're the best. One of the biggest clashes of last night took place between Marco Rubio and Rand Paul, the two senators sparring over taxes and defense spending.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUBIO: I know that Rand is a committed isolationist, I'm not. I believe the world is a stronger and a better place when the United States is the strongest military power in the world.(APPLAUSE)PAUL: Marco, how is it conservative, how is it conservative to add a trillion dollar expenditure for the federal government that you're not paying for. How is it conservative.(CROSSTALK)PAUL: How is it conservative to add a trillion dollars in military expenditures? You cannot be conservative if you're going to keep promoting new programs that you're not going to pay for?RUBIO: Can I respond?(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: We can't even have an economy if we're not safe. There are radical jihadists in the Middle East beheading people and crucifying Christians. A radical Shia cleric in Iran trying to get a nuclear weapon.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: The Chinese taking over the South China Sea. Yes, I believe the world is a safer -- no, no, I don't believe. I know that the world is a safer and better place when America is the strongest military power on the -- in the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Senator Ted Cruz also weighed in on that debate saying there's middle ground.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: You think defending this nation is expensive? Try not defending it. That's a lot more expensive, but you can do that and pay for it. You can do that and also be fiscally responsible.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: I thought that was one of Ted Cruz's best moments of the night. This is one of your favorite topics -- national security.GUTFELD: Yeah, you know that was -- in my opinion, that was the best line of the night, what Cruz had said. And I -- and it was -- it didn't seem like it was prepared. It was just sincere. And what Rubio says is correct. This is why it keeps going back, this is the Cuban sandwich. Because I mean, when Rubio said -- no it's true. What I've said before, one terrorist attack, erases off the front page any kind of economic news. And the most important topic, I believe, in the economy is future attacks, married to technology by non-state actors. It's not about China. It's not about Russia. It's about a group of people who now can do whatever they want whenever they want, and we have to really think about that. If that makes you a liberal by having a huge military, then I'm a big liberal. But I think that in order to be a conservative, you have to protect the freedom and the values that make you a conservative because people hate you. People hate the west. So if you want to be conservative or libertarian for the rest of your life, be a liberal when it comes to spending money on the military.PERINO: But what was Cruz was saying Eric, was that -- it's not -- this is not a zero-sum gain that you can be a conservative and say, OK, we need to be smarter about some of our spending and where we're investing, but that doesn't mean that we should not do that kind of investing.BOLLING: And I think you're right. Cruz kind of bridged that gap.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: Between Rubio and Rand, but what Rand did was basically -- Rand has been trying to get some traction and he hasn't really, frankly, he hasn't been getting much traction. So what he did last night, I think is when he went back to the base. He went right back to small government, even if it means cutting the military, cutting a dollar and mandatory spending. Make sure one of them is equal with the military spending in that cut. So he went there, I think he actually resonated with the people who wanted to follow Rand, who couldn't. However, Ted Cruz sounded like what you would, as a conservative who is concerned about our safety and terror. The right, the more, I don't know, the palatable way to go. So spend what you need to spend to keep yourself safe. Just keep your government small.PERINO: One of the things they didn't do, Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: Was actually, tie the economy, like having a strong and growing economy is the best way to help pay for a strong national defense. I didn't feel like that was that they actually connected the dots there.GUILFOYLE: OK. Just -- so all the commercials that run for Jeb Bush showing him speak in the town halls say just that. Having a strong military is necessary for the U.S. economy, as well as for our position of national security and strength. The two do go hand in hand. And that's what needs to be pointed out to detractors that are trying to make excessive cuts in military spending and defense. You cannot do that. It trickles down, it has an effect on all of it, and you have to tie the two together and make that case. And you can do it in a sentence or two and do it powerfully, so the people understand the message and the importance of it. That it isn't just like neocons recklessly trying to spend. It's about dollars and cents. It's about the American paycheck. It's about the American wallet and our safety and security here and abroad.WILLIAMS: Wait a second, wait a second. I'm sorry. I just got so confused.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I watched the debate last night.GUILFOYLE: What else.WILLIAMS: And in the debate last night, what I heard was Marco Rubio saying, ""Oh, you know, I want to rearrange the tax system so that we give an exemption or a rebate to families because I love families. But i also want to increase, hike up defense spending."" Rand Paul says, ""Hey, wait a second. You're doing both at one time? That's a contradictory message and you're going to blow up the economy."" I thought Rand Paul was on target. I know it wasn't popular with conservatives. But guess what? I thought he spoke the truth.GUILFOYLE: He's talking about fiscal responsibility, but there's also ways to cut reckless spending in other areas to help balance it out.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Oh, you don't think there's any reckless spending at the Pentagon?PERINO: No, you can't -- I think that's what Ted Cruz was saying, you could do that. But I do think Eric that, but Juan makes a point that all of them are vulnerable on a couple of points which is.BOLLING: Oh, yeah.PERINO: How do you show that you can do your tax plan with cutting without having to raise taxes somewhere else, or how do you actually make this math work? That is a challenge.BOLLING: I have a challenge to all of them in fact. I've read every single one of their tax plans. And the only way any of them work is about 4 percent growth rate. We haven't seen 4 percent growth in about six years. So, anything sub-4 percent, you're going to have a ton of debt. So I -- that's something that they will all have --but the good news is by the way, very quickly, five weeks until the next debate. And we're probably going to look at, maybe national security next time.GUTFELD: That I hope so.GUILFOYLE: But you know why everybody did so well, because the way this debate was conducted with the extra time, it was dignified. They're able to get to substantive issues, that's credit to Fox honestly, and to the moderators, because the take-away today from all the different camps, and supporters. They feel their guy or Carly did well in terms of getting the issues out there.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: She was smart.PERINO: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: Even Politico had an article about Jeb Bush saying his supporters are happy.GUTFELD: If you're going to spend money on something that is created by the government, at least spend it on something you know that works. The only thing that really works is the military, because it has to work. And it's, if it doesn't work, people die. So we know, at least I want, I want my tax money to go to something that I know actually is productive.PERINO: You want to be able to check the box for where you want your money to go.GUTFELD: I would love to do that.GUILFOYLE: I would love it.PERINO: All right, ahead.GUILFOYLE: They can do it.PERINO: You've been waiting for this. The Missouri media professor, who tried to block the press from covering the protest on her campus, won't be teaching there anymore, Greg, on that development and more, next.GUILFOYLE: By the way, it's good.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: You remember Melissa Click, that University of Missouri -- whatever, caught on tape threatening a reporter covering a protest.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm media. Can I talk to you?MELISSA CLICK, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI: No, you need to get out. You need to get out.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, I don't.CLICK: You need to get out.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I actually don't.CLICK: All right. Hey, who wants to help me get this reporter out of here? I need some muscle over here!(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: She reminds me of that prop comic.Anyway, she resigned her courtesy appointment with the school, which raises a question: What is a courtesy appointment? And who is it being courteous to? She seems as courteous as a hemorrhoid.So how did this start? Well, a swastika appeared on a bathroom wall -- a murky incident, much like many hate crimes, which often end up as hoaxes. There were two other incidents causing students to demand safe spaces from the press that they seek. It's a blooming onion of idiocy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)CLICK: You need to back up. Respect the students. Back up.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am a student.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hey hey! Ho ho! Reporters have got to go.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey hey, ho ho, reporters have got to go.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey hey, ho ho, reporters have got to go.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You think it's funny. You've got to move.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is the First Amendment that protects your right to stand here and protects mine.I've a job to do.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We don't care about your job.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have a right to live and get an education and have a life to live. Please leave.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm a student.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: These are more students who are asking you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're pushing me.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's our right to walk forward.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Someone should hire that reporter.PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: How odd that protests used to be about free expression, but now it's about silencing it. Stalin must be smiling.Now, all this led to a boycott by the school's 4-5 football team. But you want to bet they wouldn't have boycott if they were 9-0? I guess it's easy to be celibate when you're homely.And there's the student hunger striker, yakking about white privilege. But his pop's an executive who made eight million bucks last year. How's that for privilege?But the students won. Mizzou's president, Tim Wolfe, resigned, an example of a cowardly implosion, when faced with the intolerant mob. They deserve each other. I'm thinking, if they want a space that's free of free speech, why not give them one? Segregate the wise from the witless. And since their skillset is petulant obsession, these idiots will ultimately turn on each other. It will be ""Lord of the Flies,"" just dumber.GUILFOYLE: Wow.GUTFELD: We've been discussing, what did she resign from? Eric, did she resign from an actual job?BOLLING: I think she's still a professor. I think she was teaching in the communications department. She had an honorary title in the media department.WILLIAMS: In the journalism school.BOLLING: In the journalism school, I'm sorry. So she gave that up for obvious reasons.GUTFELD: Yes.BOLLING: No. 1, the First Amendment that she was clearly trying to violate there. By the way, the same First Amendment that allows the protesters to be there, she was trying to use against the student journalist.Day three now, and I'm still waiting for Juan to come up with something besides the questionable swastika incident and one racial word thrown at one of the leaders of the black caucus. One instance got two people fired. As far as I know, I haven't read any more, but feel free to enlighten me.WILLIAMS: I didn't even mention the swastika yesterday. But I mean, to me -- like you're -- no, I think you're trying to minimize the complaint coming from the black students.But I'm going to just tell you something. It's Jewish students. It was graduate students. It was the people in the Missouri legislature. It was the governor. All said, ""You know what? The leadership at this school is failing.""And then the black kids said, ""Even when we tried to get access to the president, you know, someone to talk to, say, 'Listen, we're having problems.'""GUTFELD: They wouldn't talk to him.WILLIAMS: ""'We don't feel safe on this campus...'""BOLLING: ""I'm not going to eat.""GUTFELD: They wouldn't talk to him.WILLIAMS: Well, that's right. They had...(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Can I just -- I have a stack here.BOLLING: The kid that wanted white privilege to be announced [SIC], his father made eight million bucks?GUTFELD: Yes. It's incredible.GUILFOYLE: He's a railroad executive.GUTFELD: Let's inject some common sense in here. This is a stack of complaints about -- that have occurred in schools in the last years that have to do with hate crimes. Each one of these cases turned out to be a hoax. I stopped counting them. But there are dozens of them. And when you hear about these things and there's no way to prove them, Kimberly...GUILFOYLE: Yes.GUTFELD: ... and people resign, it's -- it's a farce.GUILFOYLE: Well, because perception becomes reality. But it's basically a fraud that's happening. Because they say, ""Oh, well, this happened, this happened."" And then, ""OK, well, now I'm going to stand in solidarity,"" because no one does their homework to actually investigate what the facts are. And it becomes like rumor and innuendo and speculation.WILLIAMS: You guys are just trying to minimize this. Remember, 19 different...GUILFOYLE: No, we're trying to get to the facts.GUTFELD: No. We're maximizing lies. It's a lie to go after it. By the way...WILLIAMS: What lie? What lie? I'm telling you -- 19...GUTFELD: You know out of 37,000 -- OK, 37,000 students. There are maybe three incidents, if they are real. That is -- it's not an endemic problem, Juan.WILLIAMS: If that's the way you define the problem, I would agree with you, Greg. But that's not the reality. So what you're doing is...(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: ... facts.WILLIAMS: I'm saying to you, when you get 19 deans at the school saying, ""We don't support not only the president, but the chancellor,"" something is wrong in that environment.GUTFELD: Yes. It's called cowardice.WILLIAMS: No, it's...GUTFELD: They are cowards.WILLIAMS: How about they're looking out for themselves.GUTFELD: They were scared of being called bigots.WILLIAMS: I don't think that that was just about race here.GUTFELD: We are in a situation here where, if you don't agree with activists, you are called a bigot. All of those administrators have folded, because they were scared.GUILFOYLE: Under pressure.WILLIAMS: This is not just about race. And that's -- that's what I think you guys are missing.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: It's about bad leadership at the school.GUTFELD: I agree. I agree with that.Let's get Dana in here. What I love about this, there are two great things about it. You actually see the culmination of identity politics, where the administrators and the students devour each other, and everybody gets to watch.PERINO: Yes, your ""Lord of the Flies"" reference is a good one. For example, last night on the debate when Marco Rubio talked about welders and philosophers, now there's even a debate about that. But what he could have said, actually, is welders and then people who study things like what she was teaching in her courtesy class, involving, like, ""Fifty Shades of Gray.""(CROSSTALK)PERINO: ""The Impact of Social Media and Fans' Relationship with Lady Gaga."" Because that's really going to help you in life.Here's another thing. Can I just say on the low information student voter issue, the graduate students are furious. What were they furious about? They were mad because their healthcare costs were being no longer being covered by the university. Why is that, Juan?WILLIAMS: Because of the Affordable Care Act.PERINO: Right. So it's President Obama's fault.GUTFELD: Ah.PERINO: Pelosi -- it's in the bill. No Republican voted for it. So I guess that's...GUILFOYLE: See the gross campaign of misinformation? That's what's so ridiculous.PERINO: My point is -- my point is...WILLIAMS: They reinstated it later. Whose fault was it then?PERINO: The reason I point that out is that the grievances are out of proportion with the results of what happened.GUILFOYLE: That's what she was saying.WILLIAMS: You know, I agree...GUILFOYLE: You're saying; you're saying; I'm saying.WILLIAMS: I agree with your argument about free speech. And what's going on at Yale and elsewhere, an abomination. But don't ignore people who tell you something's racial or something...GUILFOYLE: But it has to be real. It has to be real. It has to be based on some actual fact. Something that really happened.GUTFELD: Is President Obama guilty of white privilege? I don't know.Anyway, I love the idea that they're creating sanctuary cities that ban free speech. That's incredible.All right. Up next, Hillary Clinton doesn't understand why the V.A. scandal is such a big deal. We'll try to clear things up for her on this Veterans Day ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: Today is Veterans Day, when we pause to honor the brave men and women who have served this great nation. Disappointingly, Hillary Clinton chose the eve of the holiday to play politics with our vets.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: As we work to improve the V.A., I will fight as long as and as hard as it takes, to prevent Republicans from privatizing it as part of a misguided ideological crusade. Privatization is a betrayal, plain and simple, and I'm not going to let it happen.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: False. One prominent veteran, Republican Senator John McCain, thinks it's shameful that Hillary politicized this the day before Veterans Day. And by the way, Hillary doesn't think this V.A. scandal is a big deal at all.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Nobody would believe that from the coverage that you see. And the constant berating of the V.A. that comes from the Republicans, in part in pursuit of this ideological agenda.RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC ANCHOR: But in part because there has been real scandal.CLINTON: There has been, but it's not been as widespread as it has been made out to be.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Wow. Rachel?PERINO: Wow. Well, I mean, at least there's a follow-up question. I think that the veterans would disagree, and the members of Congress on both sides of the aisle would disagree with her. And this is one of the things, I think, that happens when you're out on the trail as the only Democrat, and you have no competition. I think that that's a real risk for her, actually.GUILFOYLE: Yes, I mean, what -- who told her that was a good idea, to do that? I mean, I think it plays very poorly for her, indeed -- Eric.BOLLING: I think I was listening to Ben Carson this morning who actually had a very good idea on the V.A. If a vet is waiting for health care, and it's more than seven days, if I'm not mistaken -- I think he said seven days -- he can go, or he or she can go to a private hospital.GUILFOYLE: Get, like, a voucher.BOLLING: Just get health care, and then the government will pay for it. And watch how fast the Veterans Administration fixes that, because that will cost them a lot more.I should point out, 22 million vets in America. We really need to be spending more time on this issue.WILLIAMS: I would say quickly that, in fact, the polls have shown historically that veterans are very pleased with the V.A. system. And I think that's what she was trying to say. The veterans actually have a higher percentage of veterans who say, ""We get good medical service"" than the rest of America.PERINO: That's true.WILLIAMS: And that's what she was trying to say.GUTFELD: But I don't know if that...GUILFOYLE: That's not what she said at all. You have some bizarre, like, interpretive machine that, like, changes it completely.WILLIAMS: No, no. I think -- I think she said it's -- there are problems, and there have been scandals, especially with the backlog of appointments, but it's not a widespread indictment of the entire V.A. system.BOLLING: All right.GUILFOYLE: All right. Yes.GUTFELD: The point here has nothing to do with vets. She -- she is interested in protecting government. She was accusing Republicans of privatization. She was attacking their idea of government. She wasn't saying it was bad for the vets. She was saying it was bad for the government. She was protecting the blob of bureaucracy. She didn't care about the vets.And why is privatization a dirty word? If you compare anything public to private...PERINO: Right.GUTFELD: ... whether it's a public-to-private bathroom, public-to-private transportation, public-to-private nudity, private always wins.GUILFOYLE: Private does it better.WILLIAMS: Yes. What happens when the V.A. has experts on the kind of injuries that our veterans suffer in battle?GUTFELD: What happens when people die waiting for treatment?GUILFOYLE: Exactly.WILLIAMS: No, no. They have great experts who deal with, you know, traumatic brain injury and the like.GUTFELD: Of course. Work in the private sector. Some -- many of them do, actually.WILLIAMS: Not as many.PERINO: But both things -- but you guys, both things can be true. Eric was saying -- what Dr. Carson was saying this morning, and Eric was reporting on that, that you can actually figure out a way to make the system work better for everybody. For example, if you live in a very rural area, and you can't make it to the specialist who lives four states away, can you get a voucher to get, at least, care until you can get there? Yes, that's common sense.BOLLING: Public/private partnership.PERINO: Yes.GUILFOYLE: All right. Somebody tell Hillary Clinton vets' lives matter.Next, social media reaction to last night's debate. What was the most talked-about moment? We'll tell you, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: ... a safer and a better place when the United States is the strongest military power in the world.SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: How is it conservative to add $1 trillion in military expenditures?(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: That moment you just saw right there between Marco Rubio and Rand Paul? The most talked-about one of the entire debate on Facebook.We've got some other Facebook trends from last night. Ben Carson was the top candidate discussed on the social network, followed by Trump, Paul, Cruz, and Fiorina.And the top issues discussed? Taxes, immigration, minimum wage, jobs, and health care.Explain to me, Kimberly, why is it that Ben Carson, the No. 1 most- discussed candidate among women on Facebook, but Rand Paul gets that among men?GUILFOYLE: Ha, I don't -- I mean, you would have me talking about Ben, and you would have dudes talking about Rand. That makes perfect sense to me. You're asking me to clarify this?WILLIAMS: I thought -- I thought...GUILFOYLE: I'm the one that called him McDreamy.WILLIAMS: All right. You got me.GUILFOYLE: Because I think women feel that he has a sensitive, understanding approach, that he's empathetic. That he listens. That he's careful, you know, what he says, what he does.WILLIAMS: There are...(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: I mean honestly, he's a man of faith. So I think that, yes, you have a lot of people from Iowa that are supporting him for that reason. Evangelicals. And they're very passionate about their candidates, so then they take to social media to spread the word.WILLIAMS: All right. So I know you love tweet -- tweeting, Mr. Twitter.BOLLING: Yes.WILLIAMS: And it says the No. 1 tweet subject was when Ted Cruz said Washington is fundamentally corrupt. Surprised?BOLLING: I'm -- I don't really think any of these are very accurate. Look at the topic. Top issue: taxes and immigration, minimum wage. Immigration and minimum wage. Those topics were hit and kind of brought out and talked about quite a bit. But taxes, they kind of hit it and quit it. How did that end up being No. 1?Ben Carson, OK, No. 1. I mean, I don't -- who knows? I'm not sure how they compile this stuff.WILLIAMS: What do you think?PERINO: I think that Facebook is an excellent partner, because I don't -- This is really, I think, the first election -- maybe you could say, maybe the last one. But this one you have more people engaged on Facebook than ever. And people are getting their information in very different ways.And something I'm very interested in is how we have three distinct generations voting in this election. Millennials, Generation X and Baby Boomers. They all see the world in very different ways. One of the things they all have in common is Facebook. And maybe millennials a little bit less on the Facebook front.But I also think it's interesting to look at where were the most engaged states that Facebook picked up? And it was Virginia, New Hampshire and Maryland. I think Virginia and Maryland, because actually, that's where people, a lot of people engaged in politics. They work in government. But New Hampshire was the No. 2 one.Who does that help? Anybody who has a really strong social media presence in that state actually does very well. And I would tell you that Ben Carson, excellent on social media in terms of the targeted, pinpointed discussion and conversation of his supporters.GUILFOYLE: A lot of young people, too.WILLIAMS: Greg, you think...GUILFOYLE: I can't believe Rubio wasn't on either of those lists.WILLIAMS: He didn't get it, no.GUILFOYLE: That, I thought, was the surprising aspect.WILLIAMS: Maybe people were impressed, but they weren't moved. They weren't talking about it. So I want to ask you if you gave this any seriousness, the fact that we now talk about politics in terms of social media footprint.GUTFELD: Well, it shows the difference between Facebook and Twitter. Twitter is for ripping, and Facebook is for response. So Twitter is your bathroom wall. Facebook is your water cooler. And almost all the time -- it doesn't really predict anything. It's just after the fact, what people talk about. I don't care.WILLIAMS: Yes, but if you put somebody down...GUILFOYLE: And Cruz has...(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Cruz has a good social media presence.WILLIAMS: All right.GUILFOYLE: And I think the lesson is Marco needs to step that up.WILLIAMS: Step it up. All right. We're going to step it up. ""One More Thing"" is coming up. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: All right. Time for ""One More Thing"" -- K.G.GUILFOYLE: And on this Veterans Day, I want to thank personally the men and women that serve and especially those that are near and dear and close to my heart and to the FOX family.U.S. Navy SEALs Jocko Willink and Lake Fabin (ph). Marcus and Morgan Luttrell. Rob O'Neill. We can show him. Pete Scobell. Also Navy SEAL.And then we have retired four-star Army General Jack Keane, one of our very favorites here. And another one of our own -- you see him on ""Outnumbered,"" in fact today you did -- Army National Guard Pete Hegseth.And who can forget John McCain, who spent five and a half years in captivity as a POW in North Vietnam?And there you have my father-in-law, Bob Villency, representing U.S. Army; and my father...PERINO: Aw, sweet.GUILFOYLE: ... Tony Guilfoyle.Thank you for all of you who put it on the line every day to keep this country safe and strong.BOLLING: All right. Dana, you're up.PERINO: Veterans Day was celebrated all across the country, including in Dallas, Texas, where there was an Oval Office replica. It's actually at the Bush Center, and the Military Service Initiative that's part of the Bush Center invited many veterans to come and get a tour this morning, and then they got a surprise from their former commander-in-chief.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What I'm talking about. Yes. Yes.Thank you all. Happy Veterans Day. It's a day for us all to thank you for your service.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: And he spent some time with them, which is great.And if you are a vet or a family that has service in your background, the Military Service Initiative, as part of the BushCenter.org, is a great one. Check it out in case you need some help.BOLLING: All righty. Greg, you're up.GUTFELD: Time for...(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Greg's Man Bun News.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: As you know, I hate man buns. But I think I figured out a way to end it forever. You can now order a fake man bun and wear it; and I think we have it right here.Why is this great? Well, if everyone wears a fake man bun, it will flood the market so nobody knows which one is a real man bun or a fake man bun, like -- it's like counterfeit $100 bills. You flood the market, and you kill the economy. Let's kill the man bun economy by everybody wearing a fake man bun.GUILFOYLE: Are you going to?BOLLING: All right. I will if you will.GUTFELD: Let's wear them tomorrow.BOLLING: We've got to order them.PERINO: Please, please, do that, please.BOLLING: OK, I'm up. Very quick. Last night, I said Snapchat me your pictures that you were taking during the debate. Check them out very quick. There's the first one, pre-debate. The second one, GOP debate on FBN.Go to the third one. Watching the debate with our college kids with the laptops open. That's perfect. No. 4, my man Ted Cruz. Go.And No. 5, this one's great: he's so awkward it's almost cute. That's Jeb there.And how about this one: Trump is drinking Mexican beer. Do you get it? The funniest one of them all.Juan, you're up.WILLIAMS: No, I don't have enough time. I just want to mention this is an interesting news development that yesterday the New York state attorney general ordered DraftKings and FanDuel to stop accepting bets from New York. Fantasy sports, oh, gee, not so fun -- fun anymore.BOLLING: We've got to leave it right there. Special thanks to all the brave men and women who have served our country this Veterans Day.
