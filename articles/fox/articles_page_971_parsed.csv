TED CRUZ BLASTED BY BOTH SIDES IN HEALTH CARE FIGHTCHARLES PAYNE: Ted Cruz was articulate, passionate, smart, witty, and he had great interactions with his colleagues. He wasn't a nut. The idea of portraying him that way, as well as trying to dismiss the Tea Party has been the agenda of the media for a very long period of time. The Tea Party would be disingenuous if it didn't go after everyone.DAGEN MCDOWELL: I agree with other Republicans that believe ObamaCare should be allowed to collapse in on itself; you don't need this kind of up front talking, you don't need this kind of grandstanding, if you just sit back and let the chips fall the American people will turn away from this law.BEN STEIN: Just let ObamaCare go through, if it's a mess, it will bring down the whole Democrat Party. Then we can get a Republican president and a Republican Congress and we can start again. At this point the ship has sailed, the bill is law. If it's a mess, it will be the end of Obama. If it works, that's great.ADAM LASHINSKY: I think what he is doing is disgusting and shameful. What we should do is pull together for legislation that has already been enacted and help it be good.WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS ANNOUNCE $300 MILLION IN AID FOR DETROITCHARLES PAYNE: Detroit is the ultimate poster child for progressive politics. You can throw money at the problem, but are they even in a position to pull them out of the problem? I don't think it will fix the fundamental problems.DAGEN MCDOWELL: It's no shock that the federal government is putting some money into this city. What is shocking is some of these undisclosed payments that were made to retirees; again, it is a bigger morass in this city than was thought before.BEN STEIN: This is not a progressive problem, it is a racial problem. This is the collapse of black family structure and the legacy of racism and slavery. It is a racial matter and has to be addressed as such.ADAM LASHINSKY: This is not a bailout. I think the federal government would like to do a bailout, I'm sure Detroit would like a bailout. The $300 million is redirected federal money to help out a city that needs its help.SAT SCORES SHOW 57 percent OF INCOMING FRESHMAN NOT READY FOR COLLEGEDAGEN MCDOWELL: There is something genius in this, I hope our educational system goes in this direction. If you can figure out what you want to do and do the cost benefit analysis before you commit to going to a four year university, then I am all in favor of this.CHARLES PAYNE: We've become a country that does not appreciate knowledge. We don't cherish intellect. We cherish sports and reality television. We don't encourage the idea of learning something new every day of your life.BEN STEIN: I love online learning. I think it is a fabulous innovation in education. If you have a kid that is willing to study and throw him into it, you have a very rare kid. For the rest of them that are just getting high all the time, it is a colossal waste of money and a colossal waste of time. I think online education is the wave of the future.ADAM LASHINSKY: On one hand, I think all sorts of students are wasting their time with college, on the other studies show that people with college degrees are the ones who get ahead. We have a conundrum there. It's a tough one.""FOURTH QUARTER"" WINNERS CHARLES PAYNE: Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS)ADAM LASHINSKY: Airgas, Inc.

 Reid Gets an Earful From Constituents 
"	" Some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine.Wise Move?Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is catching some flack from Nevada Muslim supporters, who aren't happy with how he has handled his opposition to the proposed mosque near Ground Zero.The Las Vegas Review Journal reports that even though the director of the Islamic Society of Nevada does not support the Ground Zero mosque either, he says Reid's opposition was based on ""politics."" Aslam Abdullah says, ""He hasn't just lost support, he has lost respect. I was surprised and amused at his political immaturity. We'll know in November how the move will affect Reid's re-election bid.""Another Las Vegas imam said, ""I'm concerned that someone with so much influence wasn't more careful in his remarks.""Hard TimeThe man serving life in prison for conspiracy in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people will have to get by on regular prison food. A Colorado judge has dismissed Terry Nichols' lawsuit that claimed the prison violates his constitutional rights by depriving him of a diet rich in whole grains, fiber and raw fruits and vegetables.The judge disagreed, saying Nichols had not proved his diet qualified as cruel and unusual punishment or that it violated his Christian beliefs.Business as UsualThose of us here in the nation's capitol are used to presidential motorcade traffic headaches, but for some Los Angeles residents, President Obama's stopover for a fundraiser Monday was anything but rush hour as usual. In some cases commuters endured an extra hour of drive time.The Los Angeles Times wrote, ""No matter their politics, Los Angeles residents found themselves united. 'It was a beautiful thing,' said Brentwood resident Myles Berkowitz, commiserating with his neighbors on Montana Avenue, 'Young, old, black, white: Everyone was P.O.'d."""	['Reid']	[]

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Almost exactly two hours and ten minutes from now, Governor Romney and President Obama will be seated at that table on that stage with moderator Bob Schieffer and the third and final debate will begin. The topic is foreign policy. And this is a big deal, because in this election debates matter.Let's look at the latest polls, the most recent out tonight, Washington Post/ABC national poll, very close. We have President Obama at 49 percent, Governor Romney at 48 percent. Then you look at the national Gallup daily tracking poll. This has Mitt Romney with a big lead, 51 to 45. And then the Real Clear Politics average, this is seven of the most recent national polls, and this has Romney up less than a point. These are national polls, obviously. And we focus on the battleground states a lot.We're back with the panel. Chuck, your thoughts of where this race stands right now ahead of this debate?CHARLES LANE, EDITORIAL WRITER, WASHINGTON POST: Well, clearly, the momentum that began for Mitt Romney after that October 3 debate has not run out. Although the big question is whether it's going to keep flowing strongly enough to carry him Ohio and get him easily over 270. Within our poll, the Washington Post poll, one of the most interesting findings is that he has basically pulled even with the president on the question of foreign policy and fighting terrorism. So, he at least comes in to this debate tonight on an even footing with the president, which is not really what I would have expected a month ago.That tells you that in a way that the overall momentum that he's gained since that October 3 debate has spilled over now and is reflecting more broadly on his image. His favorability rating is nearly even with the president's.  He is in pretty good shape. Whether it's good enough to actually win, we'll find out.BAIER: A lot of focus, Steve, on Ohio as Chuck mentioned. The new Suffolk University poll out tonight has it tied 47-47 in Ohio. The Real Clear Politics average of polls in Ohio, and again, this is the seven most recent polls in the state of Ohio has the president with just a slight lead there. It seems like Governor Romney is closing the gap there, even though Democrats have been kind of crowing about Ohio for a long time.STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Well, it does, and if I were the Obama campaign that is the poll of all the things that come out, both today and over the weekend that concerns me the most, the fact that Suffolk has it dead even there. There was also inside that same Washington Post/ABC poll -- poll of the seven battleground states, which found that Mitt Romney was up 52-46 in those battleground states. Those are the two things that I think would concern me most.I talked to people on the ground in Ohio over the past several days that says what echoes in part what Chuck is saying. After the first debate, Mitt Romney saw this surge in enthusiasm and energy. People were eager to rush in to the Romney headquarters. They were making phone calls, doing things they had had trouble getting people to do.There was just, remember, about three weeks ago some talk, loose talk maybe, of Mitt Romney pulling out of Ohio. He wasn't going to compete there anymore. That is gone. And the way that one person I talked to characterized it to me was, what happened was President Obama -- they are running a marathon and with one mile left, Mitt Romney looks up, President Obama is in front of him, and Obama has stumbled. And Mitt Romney now sees he can overtake him if he continues to press his case.BAIER: Quickly, Charles, one more state, Colorado another swing state. A new poll out by Rasmussen has Governor Romney up 50-46, and the Real Clear Politics average there has Romney up just slightly in the state of Colorado. It's possible also without Ohio that there is a way that Romney wins. What is your take of the state of the race?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: That is exactly right. There are now other paths which are not at all terrible long shots that you can substitute for Ohio if he doesn't carry it.But I think what is happening tonight is that Romney has the momentum.  And as long as he draws even tonight, he doesn't even have to win. If he draws even tonight, the momentum continues and I think that would carry him to a victory. So he just has to hold serve. He doesn't have to hit a homerun to make seven scores into one metaphor.BAIER: Charles, Chuck, Steve, thank you. As always, that is it for the panel. We'll wrap things up here from the spin room after a quick break. Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2012 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.ANDREA TANTAROS, CO-HOST: Well, some historic votes today in the Senate on an immigration bill that would open a door to citizenship for millions of illegals in this country.Here, two proponents of comprehensive immigration reform, President Obama and Republican Senator Marco Rubio.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: This bill isn't perfect. It's a compromise, and going forward nobody is going to get everything that they want. If you think that a broken system is the best America can do, I guess it might make sense to try to block it. But if you actually are serious and sincere about fixing a broken system, this is the vehicle to do it.SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA.: The first and foremost thing that it does, it says to the people that are here illegally, come forward, we have a process for you that you're going to have to undergo to be in this country legally.(END VIDEO CLIPS)TANTAROS: Recently, Marco Rubio came under fire for saying that citizenship should come before border security.Eric, you spent some time on the Hill today. You broke away from ""The Five"" for a little bit. Did you learn anything on what we can expect?ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: You know, I did. I sat with Senator Rand Paul for lunch in the Senate dining room -- very nice, by the way. I'll show you a picture later in the show.(CROSSTALK)TANTAROS: Get a haircut?BOLLING: No, I didn't get a haircut. I think they shut that down.By the way, you bought me a sandwich for lunch, too, thank you very much.I came up with something. We talked and we kind of -- he was talking about how Texas is working with the boarder, but Arizona and New Mexico weren't. I said, Senator, what's different. He said the Texas border is pretty much privately owned.So, if ranchers own the border between Texas and Mexico, that's not the case in New Mexico and Arizona and somewhat California, said why don't we do this? That's all federal land, by the way. Why don't we sell that federal land or give it to someone willing to secure the border. Let the private sector handle border security.Like you know, we have had this discussion, like an enlightening moment for a minute, I think it might certainly help.BOB BECKEL, CO-HOST: Those private land owners do not provide border security. They are the ones who bring illegals in so they can do their work.BOLLING: No, he said it's working. He says, they don't want the problems. They don't want the crime and they secure the border in Texas.PERINO: They also don't care about the lives, that they don't want people coming across on their land. Ranches are so big, and sometimes the heat so strong, and especially if it's a child or woman unable to take care of themselves, one of the thing ranchers do, but I am making his point.(LAUGHTER)TANTAROS: Could I ask you about the politics on this a little bit? So, Harry Reid said he would allow as many amendments as possible, and there's one school of thought believe he is purposely doing this so Republicans will add all of these amendments, then he can say, see, they're blocking immigration reform, maybe Republicans are adding amendments to go to their districts and having to say, see, these Democrats don't want border security but we do.Who do you think is right or maybe both?DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Well, lots of gamesmanship, I have a particular opinion about Senator Reid's action in 2007 which ended that opportunity for comprehensive immigration reform, that was a political decision on his part.So, there's a lot of politics that go back and forth. The challenge for the politicians involved, they have to communicate very succinctly and clearly to the American people, because you're going to have so many theories on the left and the right about what's actually in the bill. You can already see it if you follow on Twitter, it's very confusing. I am going to watch this debate. After it passes the Senate, if it passes Senate, then I'll take a good hard look what's in it. It still has to go to the House and, you know, how the bill becomes law.BECKEL: The politics of this, Republicans are going to pass it because they've got to pass it, because without Hispanics, they have no chance of being a national party.TANTAROS: But there's a lot of opposition in the House. Even if they get it out of the senate this summer, there's still a lot of Republicans that are not psyched about the bill at all.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Look, I think I am like most Americans. I want a process but I don't want a procession. This is a procession. The fact is if we do this, why not cut out the middleman, have all of the new immigrants report to DNC headquarters and Wasserman Schultz can swear them in, because that's what they're talking about?I want to know, Bob, I want to know, will this path to citizenship include the Irish or Poles? I expect as much diversity to get in a Utah barbershop quartet.BECKEL: None of these people will vote for 15 or 20 years.TANTAROS: Is that why union bosses were standing with President Obama today because they're interested in membership and it is the quickest way to get it?BECKEL: They were fighting it, they didn't want underpaid workers coming in.BOLLING: There's no question the Republican Party has to figure out a way to bring the Hispanic vote back into the fold, when George Bush 40 something percent, they need to do it.Can I offer something else? How about increasing legal immigration? We let about a million people, how about letting 2 million or 3 million in.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Why does the bill need to be a thousand pages?PERINO: Every comprehensive bill has to be a thousand pages or it is nothing.GUTFELD: Ground the government. Tell them to limit bills to 10 pages, including cartoons. This is ridiculous.TANTAROS: In Greg Gutfeld's world, they're grounded from a couple of episodes --GUTFELD: Exactly, government is still in it's room, not watching TV or listening to records.PERINO: Do you have Wi-Fi in there?GUTFELD: No.TANTAROS: It should get spanked.GUTFELD: Yes, everybody should.Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC.

5	5	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/01/21/jack-welch-cruz-is-valuable-as-insider-outsider/	Jack Welch: Cruz is valuable as an 'insider outsider'	"This is a rush transcript from ""Your World,"" January 21, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: Of course, we're watching and we will keep an eye on two separate events, of course, Donald Trump in Las Vegas. We will see if he makes any reference to Ted Cruz, Ted Cruz in Manchester, New Hampshire.What is so shocking about this is, these guys used to be known for not even laying a glove on each other. While all the accusations and ranting and raving against certainly Donald Trump were going on, Ted Cruz stood back, and when it came to the criticisms of Ted Cruz, Donald Trump stood back. Not now.What does former GE CEO Jack Welch make of that and all of these crosscurrents? I don't know.Good to see you.JACK WELCH, FORMER CHAIRMAN & CEO, GENERAL ELECTRIC: It's part of a good battle. And we're narrowing it down to two and...CAVUTO: You think it's going to be one of those two?WELCH: Well, right now, it looks that way. And I don't see anybody gaping real momentum yet. We have got three elections coming up pretty quickly. And we will see if some momentum changes.But, right now, this is a two-person race.CAVUTO: It's interesting, Jack. You were way ahead of the so-called Cruz phenomenon. You were interested and eying him when he was nowhere in the polls, I think even before he formally entered the race.But you saw something then. And it got my attention, because, for want of a better term, you might be deemed an establishment kind of guy. So what were you seeing in him early on? And I assume you still see it.WELCH: There are couple of things I really like about Ted Cruz.One, he does what he says he's going to do, whether it be on ObamaCare and shutting the government down, or doing another -- he says it, and he does it. The second thing I really like about him -- and I would like you to think about this, Neil, because I think people don't recognize the value of an insider-outsider combination coming into a job.He knows what he doesn't like. I go out -- I was an insider outside 35 years ago when I got the job at GE. Our approval ratings of my team and I were 25 percent. Now, we didn't have to win the election. We got appointed. When we retired 20 years later, we had over 95 percent approval. But we went in there, we cleaned the place out. Of course he's going to...CAVUTO: But they were nervous with you. You were this kid.(CROSSTALK)WELCH: And they were Bob Doles, and there were all these guys out there, the establishment, if you will, telling my predecessor, don't pick this wild man. OK? This is nuts.So, if you ran a popularity contest, Ted Cruz, he is calling him a cartel. He's calling...CAVUTO: If he became president, what Donald Trump is saying, you have to go to these people, you have to work with those people.  WELCH: If you're the boss, you can make things happen.CAVUTO: It's different in Washington, Jack.WELCH: No, they will all line up. They will all line up.I will guarantee you that establishment will be behind him like ducks.CAVUTO: Really? Really? Because the Bob Dole line and it goes off with the Donald Trump line, they hate him, you don't buy that?WELCH: They might not like him getting the job.  It ruins their game.CAVUTO: Right. Yes. Yes.WELCH: They have a nice game there. They have stayed for 25, 30 years. They pass things to each other. He's going to upset them.CAVUTO: Do you think he will absorb all these blows? Because one thing that happened -- and we noticed it post the FBN debate -- and that whether it's the issue, whether he is a natural-born citizen, whatever Donald Trump is doing has at least stalled Cruz's rise in Iowa.Now, polls are, as you often remind me, fleeting. But what do you make of that, that Trump is succeeding in planting seeds of doubt?WELCH: Trump is a masterful politician. Let's face it. He's a great campaigner.CAVUTO: What kind of president do you think he would be, if it got that far?WELCH: Look, here's my view.We had Jimmy Carter, and we couldn't bring the country back a little bit at a time after that disaster. Now we have got a guy that is twice as bad as Jimmy Carter ever thought of being, and we can't...CAVUTO: You're talking about Barack Obama.WELCH: Yes.CAVUTO: See, all this time, I thought you liked him. No, go ahead.(LAUGHTER)WELCH: We can't nudge this thing back, Neil.You don't want to -- we got to get this country back. And Ted Cruz -- Donald Trump is a great guy. He's a great negotiator.CAVUTO: Are you surprised how well he is doing?WELCH: Yes.CAVUTO: What do you think it is?WELCH: I think he is articulate in these debates. I think he says things that a lot of people are thinking.CAVUTO: Right.WELCH: I think he might even be underpolling, because I know a lot of people, oh, I would never vote for him, I would never vote for him.CAVUTO: Absolutely. No, I agree with you on that.WELCH: But I think, when they go in the booth, they will vote for him.I think he could be -- we will learn a lot in these first couple of votes. If he outpolls the -- if he out -- gets the votes more than the polls were, we're going to -- then he has got the whole...CAVUTO: I talk to a number of Democratic operatives, and they always tell me, Neil, this is a dream come true for us. Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, hello?What do you say? They used to say that about Ronald Reagan.WELCH: And I think the biggest thing the Republicans have to worry about is, Hillary might get yanked and old Joe might ride in on a white horse, because she is so vulnerable.CAVUTO: Do you get a sense, though, from any of this that it's going to get crazy, or that Republicans are going to rip themselves up here, arrive in Cleveland without a nominee, and it could be a protracted -- ballot after ballot?WELCH: No, I don't think -- same people will come on board.Look, I think that there's no question that with the environmentalists and all these people, with immigration, the Democrats have lost some of their natural constituency in the Midwest and unions. And I think that's going to be a different vote.CAVUTO: All right, we're taking a look, by the way, as Jack is speaking -- and we will keep an eye on it.This is the freed U.S. Marine, Amir Hekmati, returning to the United States, to Michigan, I believe. We will keep an eye on that. He had been held captive for about four-and-a-half years, originally went to go to that neck of the woods in Iran to see his ailing grandmother. The Iranians felt that he was a spy, held him up in all of this.The Iran agreement, of course, got him back here. Again, we're monitoring, but back with Jack Welch.Bailouts became a very big theme at the debate, not the least of which because of what has been going on in the markets. A lot of people say it could be repeated, the financial meltdown then. No two crises are alike.I asked Christie about it. I asked Cruz about it. I'm not going to replay the bites. To a man, they said, no, we don't rescue again.But if a Bank of America were up on the wall, against the wall, or a Citigroup, do you think a president would let happen?WELCH: I don't think the market fallout fear is something that's going to create that yet.We still have a reasonably weak economy, but we have been saying that for a year.CAVUTO: Right. Right. Maybe because it's so weak, it can sputter on a while.WELCH: And I don't think the economy is falling off a cliff here.CAVUTO: You don't?WELCH: I think it's slow.CAVUTO: You don't think this presages anything horrible or anything like that?WELCH: I think it -- look, the market -- the assets were inflated. The economy isn't catching up with the assets that people hoped they would. Earnings are going to be weaker, but they're not disastrous. They're not disastrous.CAVUTO: You're Hillary Clinton and you're looking at this market moving. Now, today, we were up and all that, but you know how it's been going, up one day, down the next.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: Yes, exactly. And we have lost a trillion bucks in market value.Do you get a sense that Hillary Clinton figures, get this out of the way early, I don't need it happening in the fourth quarter, right?WELCH: I think she is so scrambling day to day as to what is happening.CAVUTO: Really?WELCH: I got a theory. You can laugh at this one. Do you think that Petraeus losing a stripe on his shoulder, do you think in any way that was teeing up something with her to let old Joe come riding in on the horse? Do you think that?CAVUTO: Do you think -- in other words, that he would...WELCH: Well, now they're taking -- if they take a stripe off of Petraeus, a star, if they do that, now you say, gee...CAVUTO: They took it off for far lesser offense. That's what you're getting at.WELCH: We got to do something to her.CAVUTO: Right.WELCH: We have to -- not me. I just have to...CAVUTO: What if the party's looking at, our only alternative then is this guy Sanders? And he is the guy who once advocated a 90 percent top tax rate? And they say he might win the nomination, but he is a sure loser.Do you think they would try to bring in a Joe Biden?WELCH: That's my two bit behind the...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: But it would too late to do that. Right? They would have to do it at the convention.WELCH: Yes. But they can do that at the convention very easily.CAVUTO: In this race, as it is, the way it's constructed now, you always hear that Wall Street financial types want a Republican, but many of them tell me Republicans have grabbed defeat from the jaws of victory so consistently, that they have serious doubts that anyone can pull this out.Do you?WELCH: Well, that's true, because we picked middle-of-the-road players.CAVUTO: Is that the reason why?WELCH: Well, I actually believe, when Romney got fewer votes than McCain, fewer actual votes, you have got to say, a lot of people had to be staying home.CAVUTO: So, they weren't jazzed.WELCH: Hopefully, we're going to jazz them now.Look, this convention -- I was with a guy this morning who has never been involved in politics at all. I'm sort of a two-bit junkie, a weak junkie, but I love it. He and I went at it for an hour. We had more fun. He said, Donald Trump has gotten me into this game.CAVUTO: Is that right?WELCH: Everywhere you turn...CAVUTO: I do think there's something to what you say, Jack.And I have raised this before, that I agree. I think Trump's support is understated, not the way that most conventional analysts see it, because, to your point, a lot of people who will never admit voting, I can kind of remember that. Even though they're very different gentlemen, very different time, those who were asked would you support Ronald Reagan and they said, former actor, this is a guy who thinks trees cause pollution, no, no, no.Obviously, something changed. Now, there were a lot of other factors.WELCH: But my guy is Cruz.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: I understand. I understand.But when people say that this race could be compromised by, let say, a Trump winning, because he is alienating so many, Latinos, women, do you buy his claim? And I know you're a Cruz guy. Trump's claim is, yes, but I'm bringing far more in.WELCH: That is a possibility.But I think you got -- when you think about Trump, do you know where he's going to go to combat what we just had for eight years? Do you really know? You don't know. He's going to make deals. He is very good at it.CAVUTO: So, what's wrong with that?WELCH: Your deals may end up being nudging us back. I want to go back.CAVUTO: You think Cruz would make more -- you just said in the beginning he is the inside-outside guy.WELCH: Yes. So, he knows what is there.CAVUTO: I see.(CROSSTALK)WELCH: He's not finding where the men's room is. He's not finding out who is here, who is there. He knows what to do.And in private equity now, we look every time for a CEO who is a rebel, who has got ideas, and we would love put him in the job, an insider rather, than pulling an outsider, who would take six months to find...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: Well, I will say this. And you're a modest guy.Early on, when you first raised his name, and a lot of people didn't know who he was, it got a lot of people's attention.All right, Jack Welch, thank you very much.Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

So we've got a bipartisan deal that managed to pass, but, Juan, bipartisanship is not all that pretty, is it?JUAN WILLIAMS, SENIOR EDITOR, THE HILL: No. I, for one, think that Elizabeth Warren is right when she says, OK, if you want to have a discussion about Dodd-Frank, let's have a discussion, but why is this all of a sudden crammed into this so called ""crum-nibus"" spending bill, $1 trillion? The answer is, as you point out, bipartisanship. We need a compromise and we need a budget. Let's get it done, and the only way to get it done is for everybody to bite their tongue and say, oh well, this is an excuse for it. I don't think that makes sense.I separated out in my mind, by the way, from what Ted Cruz did, and today I think Republicans are more angry with Ted Cruz than Democrats.MCKELWAY: George, yesterday, on ""Fox News Sunday"" you made mention of the fact that this is yet another bill because of this bipartisanship that we have to pass in order to find out what's in it.GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: And no one will find out even then. If it's already passed, why bother to read it? We have two exceedingly strange careers under way here. Elizabeth Warren, who has one election, a Democrat in Massachusetts, not heavy lifting, says that she's really worried about risk, and she's focused on some minor matter about derivatives and banks. Yet a few days ago, Fannie and Freddie announced they are going to have mortgages for low- income people with three percent down. This is walking right down the same path to the housing crisis that Fannie and Freddie really gave us that catalyzed the great recession.Then we have Ted Cruz. There have been 1,950 senators in the history of this country and I can't imagine there's been a more peculiar career than the one he's having right now. He is completely, almost insouciantly indifferent to the idea that politics is a team sport. Juan is absolutely right. Democrats I think are more bemused by him. He is, frankly, loathed within the Republican caucus. And if he seeks the Republican nomination and doesn't get it, then what? He has to come back here? That's awkward.MCKELWAY: I have to bring up a quote, David Harsanyi writing in the Federalist said of Elizabeth Warren, quote, ""Her hard left economics -- what the press quixotically refers to as economic populism -- propels today's liberal argument. It is the default position of nearly every grassroots constituency on the left. The center of the Democrats' agenda. This isn't just reflected in the embrace of class struggle, (inequality), but a slow warming to socialistic ideas. Right now, few if any politicians are better than Warren at stoking the anxiety that makes that work."" Charles?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Look, she's going to run against Wall Street, populist, it's called. What exactly is she going to do, and what do we do if she succeeds and brings it down? If you want to break up the banks a lot of conservatives will support that. But I think what's more interesting -- and incidentally, I think she ought to run. I'd be the number one supporter. I'd love to see her run. It would be a festival if you're a conservative or a Republican. We put up anybody sentient on the other side it would be a good night on election night.But Cruz is a very interesting guy. You heard in that clip, he said, you have to decide if you want to stand with the -- I don't know, with the administration or with the American people. His idea of conservatism is standing with, making a statement, rather than I think the conventional idea is doing something.Now, there was no way in which the objection he raised over the weekend was going to do anything, anything at all to stop the president's executive order. A 12-year-old with a piece of chalk on a blackboard could have drawn a graph that would have shown how it was impossible. But what it did do is it gave Harry Reid the opening to use procedural tricks that today have given us a surgeon general who believes that gun control is a health issue. So that's his achievement, thus far. We're going to have a couple of others of those as Harry Reid gets new appointees who otherwise would not have been nominated and approved into office as a result of the Cruz maneuver.MCKELWAY: Quickly, George.WILL: Elizabeth Warren is a very peculiar kind of populist. Foe of crony capitalism, friend of the export-import bank, also known as Boeing's bank. It's an interesting combination.MCKELWAY: That's it for the panel. But stay tuned for what happens when Democrats and Republicans compromise.  "	['Reid', 'Cruz', 'Warren']	[]
