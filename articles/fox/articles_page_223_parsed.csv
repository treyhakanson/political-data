"The politics of terror, that is the subject of this evening's ""Talking Points Memo.""Looks to me like this terror incident in London today was done by amateurs, but nevertheless, it is getting worldwide attention. At this point, nobody was hurt. Police say four low-level bombs were involved, but that's still being defined. There was only minor damage.Now let's go to the big picture. It is becoming very clear that everybody on this planet is going to have to make a decision about terrorism, but there really are only three options. You can take a hard line, which is my position. You can appease terrorism, which is Spain's position. Or you can refuse to confront the issue at all. And unfortunately, millions of people are doing that.""Talking Points"" will once again state that if every decent person in the world would join together against terrorism, it would be defeated quickly, but obviously that's not happening.Now here in the USA, we have people who have made a huge deal out of Guantanamo Bay (search), Abu Ghraib, the run up to the Iraq War, and other issues surrounding the terror war.In my opinion, some have lost sight of the real issue, because of the politics. With all due respect to the left wing in this country, when Islamic fascists are slaughtering civilians, I'm not sure the abuse at Abu Ghraib (search) should be our main concern.All Americans should realize that mistakes are going to be made fighting a global war on terror, but we should also realize that if we don't aggressively fight it, more Americans will die in the streets.Now on tonight's ""Factor"", you will once again hear people blaming Tony Blair (search) and President Bush for terrorists. You'll also see that the BBC (search), the CBC (search), and other news organizations around the world simply will not call the threat what it is.So why is this happening? The answer again is politics. These people despise Bush and Blair. And the terrorists take a back seat to that.The dissenters are right, however, when they say that the war in Iraq has helped the terrorists. It has by creating division. That's just what bin Laden (search) wants.In the long run, however, terrorism could be dealt a severe blow if Iraq becomes an effective Democratic country. Obviously, the terrorists fear that. And more obviously, the free world should be helping Iraq, not quibbling over it.Comes a time when you have to decide what's best for everyone. And there's no question that what is best for everyone in the world right now is to defeat Islamic fascism. You've got to stop the nonsense. And that's ""The Memo.""The Most Ridiculous Item of the DayOn Monday, we said that New York state assembly leader Sheldon Silver is the worst elected official in the USA. That's because he has consistently blocked any kind of increased penalties for violent child sex offenders.Now Silver is afraid to talk to us but he told The New York Sun newspaper that ""The Factor,"" quote, ""does not deal with reality,"" end quote.However, a spokesman for the Republican minority in the New York state assembly agreed with our assessment of Silver's soft stance on child sexual offenders. He said, quote, ""Assembly Democrats are the lone obstacle in keeping these new tough initiatives from becoming law in New York State."""	[]	[]

3	3	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2007/02/02/whoopi-goldberg-hollywood-politics	Whoopi Goldberg on Hollywood Politics	"This is a partial transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" February 1, 2006, that has been edited for clarity.BILL O'REILLY, HOST: Thanks for staying with us. I'm Bill O'Reilly.In the ""Personal Story"" segment tonight, celebrities and politics. As you may know, we interviewed a number of famous anti-Iraq war actors last weekend in D.C. about policy. And we got a huge response from you after that exposition.Now, with us is actress and now radio talk show host Whoopi Goldberg. No stranger to politics. Her show ""Wake Up With Whoopi"" is syndicated nationally. OK.WHOOPI GOLDBERG, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: You got to come visit me on national...O'REILLY: I'm glad that we finally got you in here, because I've always wanted to talk to you for years.GOLDBERG: Thank you.O'REILLY: OK now, you are an outspoken person on politics and life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We went down and talked to -- let's give Tim Robbins. We said to Mr. Robbins, ""Listen, what about Iran? If we get out of Iraq and they come down and they cause trouble what do you do?""And he said to our reporter Porter Barry, our producer Porter Barry, ""Well, why don't you enlist?"" Now come on. You know, I mean we're asking a serious question, and he's out front on this anti-Iraq thing and goes Porter Barry, ""Why don't you enlist?""GOLDBERG: Well, Bill, did he know he's from your show?O'REILLY: Yes, he knew.GOLDBERG: OK. So come on. You know.O'REILLY: Wait a minute.GOLDBERG: He could not -- you know, he could not answer any other way. The question...O'REILLY: Why not?GOLDBERG: Well, because I'm sure that a lot of folks feel sometimes that they're about to be jumped. And so they just stay neutral.O'REILLY: Porter Barry is 5'8"".GOLDBERG: I know.O'REILLY: He's a nice guy.GOLDBERG: I'm sure.O'REILLY: He asked a legitimate question.GOLDBERG: You seem to be a nice guy too but people are really...O'REILLY: I'm not. I'm not. No. If it were me, and I know Robbins, if it were me I would say you are right. Robbins goes, ""O'Reilly."" But this guy asked a legitimate policy question to a guy who's making a stand.GOLDBERG: Maybe -- maybe he felt that -- you know what?O'REILLY: He didn't know the answer.GOLDBERG: Well, there might not be answer that you will be comfortable with it or that you want to air.O'REILLY: But don't you feel it's his responsibility if he or Jane Fonda and the rest and you too are going to take strong policy stands, because people do listen to you...GOLDBERG: Yes. Yes.O'REILLY: ... that you know what the heck you're talking about?GOLDBERG: Well, I think he's very clear that he is not for the war in Iraq. It's not a new stance that he's had. He's also for years been a peace activist. So this can't come as a surprise to anybody.No. 2, when I take a stance on something, all I can talk to you about it how I feel about it and why. And I don't have to justify it, and you don't have to listen to it. But it is important for everyone to know that they have an opinion and they have a -- have a right to express it.O'REILLY: But your opinion is a little bit more heard than somebody -- than Sally in Charlotte, North Carolina.GOLDBERG: No different than yours.O'REILLY: No, but I back mine up all day long with facts and everything else.GOLDBERG: But you know what? Your opinion is your opinion. And if you want to go...O'REILLY: Based on facts.GOLDBERG: And if you want to go and get lots of facts and not go from your heart. I go from my heart. I don't -- listen -- I'm not -- I wasn't a fan of the war in Iran. I'm still not -- I'm sorry in Iraq.O'REILLY: Iraq. Right.GOLDBERG: I'm still not a fan of the war in Iraq. I think we went in under misguided ideals and with no real way to get out. And now what we're seeing is everybody saying how are we going to get out? How are we going to get out? Democrats, tell us how we're going get out. Republicans, how are we going to get out? Nobody has an answer. Nobody knows how to get out of this, because it's a mess.O'REILLY: And that's a legitimate point of view.GOLDBERG: OK. That's my opinion.O'REILLY: And I respect that point of view. But if you're going to go out and say to millions of people we got to get out of there now, then, I'm going come in and say, ""Well, what happens if we do that? Do we put America in more danger?"" And it doesn't matter how you feel, you need to -- you need to think about that.GOLDBERG: If you are asking my opinion...O'REILLY: Yes.GOLDBERG: Then it does matter how I feel.O'REILLY: No, you need to think about it.GOLDBERG: No, Bill. You need to think about it. That's how you do it. I don't do it that way.O'REILLY: So you don't have a responsibility to back up how you feel?GOLDBERG: No. I have a responsibility to answer your question.O'REILLY: What if you -- then answer this one.GOLDBERG: Yes.O'REILLY: What if how you feel puts your family and mine in danger?GOLDBERG: Well, here's the question. The way you felt seems to have enabled us -- and if I'm speaking out of turn you'll tell me. But it seems that everyone who said yes let's go in and do this, yes, let's go in and do this, has helped to create this deep instability which exists right now in the Middle East.The Shia Muslims, they're now, they're here, they're there, they're there, they're there. We are more unstable now going in and having done this and not going in and doing what we said we were going to do, which is go to take care of Usama bin Laden. That's what we said we were going to do.O'REILLY: That's a good point.GOLDBERG: OK, so I'm saying...O'REILLY: Let me answer.GOLDBERG: But I didn't finish.O'REILLY: You got a good point. Don't step on your good point.GOLDBERG: Oh sugar!O'REILLY: All right. Your good point is that people like me...GOLDBERG: Yes, Dad.O'REILLY: ... who supported the war in the beginning...GOLDBERG: Yes.O'REILLY: ... were wrong because of two things. There were no weapons of mass destruction. We couldn't possibly know that, but it turned out. And the Bush administration has fouled up the execution of the war. You're correct.GOLDBERG: OK.O'REILLY: But you don't compound one mistake by making another.GOLDBERG: Which mistake are you talking about? Because you haven't answered yet.O'REILLY: Because if you cut and run from Iraq...GOLDBERG: Right.O'REILLY: ... if you pull out now...GOLDBERG: You haven't asked me what I think about this. You haven't asked me that.O'REILLY: I'm going to get to that.GOLDBERG: OK.O'REILLY: If you do that now, you create more problems for the USA, and Robbins won't address it. And Sarandon didn't. And you know what -- you know what we did? We asked Jane Fonda when we got out of Vietnam three million people were slaughtered by the so-called victors, Khmer Rouge and the North Vietnamese. What do you think about that, Jane?And Jane says, it was our fault. That's just dumb.GOLDBERG: Well that's her opinion.O'REILLY: And it's dumb.GOLDBERG: Well, but you can't make that distinction of what's dumb is not.O'REILLY: Sure, I can. Fact is fact. Three million dead people.GOLDBERG: Then tell me, Bill O'Reilly, now that we have destabilized so much in the world why we didn't go after, and I never can say...O'REILLY: But you can't violate the sovereignty of Pakistan. You can't go into Pakistan and start ripping through villages.GOLDBERG: You don't even know what I was asking. Had nothing to do with Pakistan.O'REILLY: Usama bin Laden, right?GOLDBERG: No.O'REILLY: That's what you asked me for.GOLDBERG: OK, but then you cut me off. Here's what my question was. If we were so concerned about keeping ourselves safe and keeping ourselves the country that we all believe that we were, why didn't we address the issue of Kim Jong-Il?O'REILLY: We are addressing that.GOLDBERG: But why didn't we address it then when he was waving those (UNINTELLIGIBLE) out the window.O'REILLY: A different situation. Because we can't start a world war with China on their border. We're letting China handle that.Listen, will you come back?GOLDBERG: I will. I loved it.O'REILLY: That was fun.GOLDBERG: Cool.O'REILLY: That was good. All right.GOLDBERG: Pleasure to meet you.O'REILLY: Tim Robbins, check her out.Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET and listen to the ""Radio Factor!""Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2007 Fox News Network, LLC.

"This is a rush transcript from ""On the Record,"" March 1, 2010. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: And it's now time for another field trip. Earlier, we went to Capitol Hill and Republican senator Chuck Grassley went ""On the Record."" (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VAN SUSTEREN: Senator, nice to see you, sir. SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY, R - IOWA: Always glad to be with you. Thank you. VAN SUSTEREN: Now, I know this was not your idea, but I'm curious if you can explain to me the Cadillac tax, the tax on these high-priced insurance -- health insurance programs. It doesn't set in until 2018 under the president's proposal. If it's a good idea, why not do it now? GRASSLEY: Oh, it was delay so that the unions so would get a big deal from the Democrats in the Senate or something that the Democrats -- the unions put pressure on the Democrats not even to have it, but the Democrats needed the revenue so they wanted to tax it. VAN SUSTEREN: Well, the tax, though -- I mean, the fact that it doesn't happen for -- I mean, the president will be out. Even if he has two terms, he'll be out. I mean, everybody's long gone. People who serve two years, even six years, long gone. So I mean, are we being tricked, basically? GRASSLEY: Can I put it in a little bigger context... VAN SUSTEREN: Sure. GRASSLEY: ... to answer your question? VAN SUSTEREN: Sure. GRASSLEY: You know, we just had to be in session Christmas Eve 2009 to pass a bill that doesn't take effect until 2014, or the provisions you're talking about don't take effect until 2018. So you get back to a basic question. Why did we have to hurry up to get a bill passed on Christmas Eve on a partisan basis, when we could have worked on it and gotten something bipartisan that would have been a little more reasonable and -- and -- because we had plenty of time. It doesn't take effect until 2014. But I -- I make a joke out of it, but there's some truth to it. You know, we had to be in session Christmas Eve because (ph) we hadn't been in session Christmas Eve since 1895. VAN SUSTEREN: All right, this tax -- does it equally apply to everybody who has a Cadillac plan, or is it only for -- are unions the only ones exempted until... GRASSLEY: You can have people that live side by side. Some are union and some are not union, and they're going to be treated differently. That's the way the bill passed the House of Representatives. VAN SUSTEREN: All right... GRASSLEY: No, that's the way the bill passed the Senate. VAN SUSTEREN: The Senate. GRASSLEY: I'm sorry. VAN SUSTEREN: All right. Here's what I don't -- in one Washington Post article -- I was trying to figure out if this is right -- it says that the tax exempts union plans and government workers until 2018. Does it not exempt the rest of us who might have that? GRASSLEY: No, it does not.  VAN SUSTEREN: So it just -- the only ones who get this special deal are the unions and the government workers? GRASSLEY: Yes. VAN SUSTEREN: Until 2018? GRASSLEY: Yes. Now, that's the way it passed the Senate Christmas Eve. Now, the president has proposed that it treat all exactly the same. VAN SUSTEREN: How did the Senate decide that government workers get a deal and everyone else didn't? I mean, we'll set aside the unions for a second. But in the Senate, why -- why did the government workers get a special deal? GRASSLEY: Well, listen, it's not right. It's not right. But you know, it's strictly power politics, the power of government unions and the power of private sector unions with the Democrat Party. And you got to remember that this was a partisan bill. This is not a bipartisan bill where maybe you'd get some moderation of these points of view. But it was strictly a power play. VAN SUSTEREN: So at least the president's bill, whether you like it or not, although it does push off to the 2018 -- at least it includes everybody on Cadillac plans, not just government workers and unions getting the special deals (INAUDIBLE) special deals pushed off to 2018. GRASSLEY: Well, that's absolutely right. Yes. VAN SUSTEREN: What do you think about the sort of the tax implications of the bill? I mean, are everyone else's taxes going up or just those with the Cadillac plans? GRASSLEY: No, everybody's taxes are going up. This is one of those instances where when they say that they have a revenue-neutral bill -- let me tell you how that game is played here in Washington. The common sense of the Midwest would not justify this. You have tax increases right now, but you don't have this program go into effect until 2014. So you have 10 years of taxes and five or six years of expenditure. Well, you can balance almost anything that way. That's the gimmicks that are behind this bill to show that it's revenue-neutral. But if you do like the Congressional Budget Office normally does, looks ahead 10 years, and you start doing this at 2014 and look ahead to the years 2024, you're going to come out with a $2.5 trillion bill that's not balanced. VAN SUSTEREN: All right. I assume because you're a member of the minority party that you're not wild about this reconciliation idea. GRASSLEY: Listen, they don't need to use reconciliation because you know right this very minute, the House of Representatives could convene and pass the Senate bill by a majority vote, just a majority vote, not a super-majority in the House of Representatives, and it could go to the president right now. So they don't need to use reconciliation if they're talking about getting a bill passed by 51 votes, a mere majority. It's already passed the Senate. Just let the House pass it if they want to get a health care bill right now. VAN SUSTEREN: That's never going to happen. The House doesn't like the Senate bill. GRASSLEY: Well, then what are they going to do? They're going to play games? You've heard this, haven't you, that they're going to let the Senate bill sit in the House of Representatives until they've used reconciliation, which they can get done with 51 votes to pass a bill by reconciliation, amending a bill that's in the House that hasn't even gotten to the Senate! We have used reconciliation to amend a bill that hasn't already been law. VAN SUSTEREN: Are you distinguishing this from what went on with, for instance, the Welfare bill? Because that was the -- that was passed by reconciliation. GRASSLEY: Well, we're distinguishing it two ways. One, I just said they're going to use reconciliation to fix up a bill that hasn't even been sent to the president yet. That's never been done before. And the second thing that's very significant about this, different than any other reconciliation you can talk about, is that this is a massive restructuring of one sixth of our entire economy! When you do something that massive and affecting life and death with 300 million Americans, it seems to me it ought to be done on a broad bipartisan basis and use -- not use gimmicks. Do you know, using reconciliation is the ultimate of backroom dealing. And that's why the public has turned against this bill because it's been done in secret, instead of the transparency that the president promised. VAN SUSTEREN: Thank you sir.

CAVUTO: Basically, Tom Petrie, a widely respected industry watcher, says kind of get used to this. Should we get used to these kind of levels for oil?BODMAN: Well, Tom Petrie is an extremely able man. And I have known him for a long time. And I used to deal with him in the financial area back in my days in the private sector. So, I count his opinion very highly.CAVUTO: It's too bad he is still listening. That's...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: All right.BODMAN: Well...(LAUGHTER)BODMAN: Even if he's not listening, I would say that.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: So, in other words, he's right that it could stay kind of around these levels? That could be bad news for the economy.BODMAN: Sure it could be bad news. And the president feels very strongly about this. He feels for the American people, the American consumer. Every time an American fills his tank with gasoline, he or she feels that kind of pain. The president feels it, and that's why we need an energy bill. This energy bill, I believe I'm a little more optimistic about it, perhaps, than my friend, Mr. Petrie, but because I believe that there are some things that will start to help in the medium term, not so much the long term.CAVUTO: Let me ask you this, though, sir. And I don't mean to rush you.BODMAN: Sure.CAVUTO: But if do we get a situation where it gets to be $70/barrel oil, would the administration be open to tapping the reserve?BODMAN: No, sir.The reserve is there for the purposes of not controlling price or not trying to manage price. It is our view that the free markets ought to determine price. The reserve is there for responding to interruptions, interruption in supply.And so, those are the conditions. If we have a hurricane and that will take out meaningful parts of our supply or some other kind of willful act on somebody's part, that's when we would use the Strategic Reserve.CAVUTO: But not until then?BODMAN: Not until then, sir.CAVUTO: OK.Samuel Bodman, thank you very much. The energy secretary of the United States, at the White House.BODMAN: Happy to be here.CAVUTO: Thank you very much.BODMAN: Thank you.Content and Programming Copyright 2005 FOX News Network, L.L.C.
