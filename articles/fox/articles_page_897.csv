"This is a rush transcript from ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" November 22, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX NEWS HOST: Good Sunday morning.Brand new Fox polls this morning putting a spotlight on how Americans feel about President Obama's Syrian refugee plan.Hi, everyone. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Welcome to ""Sunday Morning Futures.""So what will come of the president's plan to accept at least 10,000 refugees into the country after news of at least one Paris attacker posing as a refugee? And the House approving a plan to tighten the refugee system. House Foreign affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce with me in moments.Plus, the president with strong words for Russian President Vladimir Putin on who his forces are targeting in the fight against ISIS in Syria. Retired four star General Jack Keane with me on the military and diplomatic relationship between the U.S. and Russia, coming up.And the GOP's top donor not handing over any money to any presidential campaign yet. Charles Koch explains why. He will join me in my exclusive sit-down as we look ahead this morning on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""The House passing a bill which would tighten the screening of Syrian refugees trying to enter the United States. Forty-seven Democrats breaking from President Obama in voting for the stricter security plan. The bill would require three high-ranking administration officials to sign off on each refugee entering the country.And the concerns of the House also being shared by the American public. Take a look at this breaking poll. A Fox News poll showing that 67 percent of voters now oppose the president's plan to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees into the country.Joining me right now is California Congressman Ed Royce, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.Congressman, thanks very much for joining us this morning.REP. ED ROYCE, R-CALI., CHAIRMAN, HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: First, I want to ask you about the -- the threats to America. We saw the video from ISIS on the Internet showing Times Square. How credible are these videos? Should we be worried?ROYCE: Well, remember, we, in New York City, have been able to knock down 12 potential attacks, planned attacks, after 9/11, successfully. So the United States has a history post 9/11 of being able to prevent attacks. At the same time, clearly, ISIS is trying to carry out those attacks and now they have a safe haven, a safe haven with their caliphate where they plan and train people. And that's what's so dangerous here.BARTIROMO: And they have clearly begun to infiltrate the flow of refugees?ROYCE: Well, they did. Obviously the bomber who blew himself up outside of the stadium in Paris, he himself was carrying a Syrian passport, had come in through Greece with that refugee population.BARTIROMO: So what's the answer here? Talk to us about the bill that is in the House right now, to make it stricter and tougher for refugees to get into the country. The president said already he will veto that.ROYCE: Yes, but that bill passed by better than a two to one margin with large bipartisan support. And what that bill does is try to have a vetting process where right now the FBI have indicated to us that they don't have the data to really vet. They don't have the intelligence on many of these individuals. And, remember, even in the case of some of the Iraqi refugees, we later found out four of them had been terrorists. So what we're saying here is that we need that in place and we need the director of the FBI and Homeland Security to sign off by attesting that we have got the -- the capability to vet and we want to see that in place so that we can protect American citizens.BARTIROMO: Can the president prove that the -- that the vetting process can, in fact, be done effectively? I mean when you think -- talk to us about the vetting process. We all know that America has a huge heart, that we want to keep our borders open. However, when you consider the fact that ISIS has infiltrated the flow of refugees, how -- how do you vet, how do you get the information you need?ROYCE: Well, two points here. One is, having the president assert this is not to us as the solution. The solution is to have the director of Homeland Security, of the FBI, they need to attest to us that -- because they're -- they're the agencies that are raising the concerns with Congress about not having the background on these specific individuals. Second, if the president is really concerned about this situation, Maria, why didn't the president, in the first place, authorize the use of the air strikes to stop ISIS from taking this territory and helping to create this refugee flow.  And why won't he sign off, for example, on today, the type of robust air campaign against ISIS or why doesn't he sign off on arming the Kurds and the Yazidis and the tribesmen, Sunni tribesmen? I mean can you imagine the frustration of having 190,000 Kurdish soldiers, 30 percent of them female, not having access to the type of weaponry that ISIS has. They don't have the mortars, the artillery, the long range -- or the anti-tank guns. And so we really need to have a reversal of his policies.BARTIROMO: So why is the president pushing back on this? I -- I -- I mean, I just don't understand it.ROYCE: We don't --BARTIROMO: He said he wants to defeat ISIS.ROYCE: If he wants to defeat ISIS, then why not support the suggestions that have been made -- been made all along to have not -- not just a robust air campaign, we've got 3,500 U.S. trainers and special ops and forces in the region trying to help the Kurds and the -- and the Sunni tribes that are fighting ISIS. Why not allow them to have the weapons? Why not -- why not authorize our pilots to be able to hit these targets? Three-quarters of these pilots come back without dropping any ordinance because they can't get authorization from the White House. So under this kind of circumstance, he's tied our hands with our -- with the containment strategy where he keeps claiming, despite all the evidence that ISIS is carrying out attacks now and recruiting from all over the world because people think they can't be defeated --BARTIROMO: Right.ROYCE: He keeps asserting, well, they're contained. No, they're not.BARTIROMO: The -- the -- the -- the issue that he keeps bringing forward is that he doesn't want any civilian casualties. I mean if -- if we've got so many of our air strikes that are actually at the end of the day not working because they're not actually hitting the targets because there are civilian casualties, is that the answer, is that what he keeps saying?ROYCE: Well, it's -- it's not civilian casualties. He's saying -- I mean, look at what the French just did to hit -- I think it was four of the training camps of -- of ISIS. They said, well, those are training camps. We're going to take those out after the Paris bombings. We must allow our pilots and those on the ground, our spotters with the U.S. military, and we must allow the Kurds and Yazidis and others that want to do the fighting to take the fight to the enemy. And this idea that you're going to not only avoid casualties, but you're not even going to offer a safe zone, which in both political parties people have said, protect, protect the Sunnis, Yazidis and Kurds up in the north by offering a safe zone so that -- so that the refugees have a place where they can be safe. If he's not even willing to do that deminimis (ph) action, how are we going to defeat ISIS? No, we have to have a reversal of this strategy.BARTIROMO: Do you have any backing to say why the president is taking this stance? I mean what -- what does your gut tell you? Why -- why does he keep saying no to the things that you and so many other military men have been saying, this is not working, this is a failure?ROYCE: I think he has underestimated the danger of ISIS from the beginning. It was the JV team. It was never going to be a threat to the United States. But we have found that because of the Internet and their ability to exploit their victories on the battlefield, that now they have become very much a recruiting problem, not just in Europe, but in the United States. So he should go back to his basic premise and rethink that thought that this is not a big problem.Second, I think he's -- he's averse to taking on the attitudes in the Shia capital of Baghdad and in -- in Iran by actually helping the Kurds, the -- helping the -- the Sunni tribesmen fighting ISIS, helping the Yazidis. Why? Because that's in the -- not in the interests of those Shia-led governments. But he needs to -- he needs to re-evaluate --BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.ROYCE: That position as well. He should not be trying with this relationship with Iran and the Shia-led government in Baghdad at the expense --BARTIROMO: Yes.ROYCE: At the expense of the stability in the region to keep pushing this.BARTIROMO: We got to get to Eric, because we want to look at the impending Senate vote. But what are you going to do?ROYCE: We're going to move legislation through my committee, not just on arming the Kurds, but also on the issue of a safe zone. And we're also going to try to push this administration to use air power effectively and hit these ISIS targets.BARTIROMO: Mr. Chairman, thank you.ROYCE: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thanks very much for joining us. Chairman Ed Royce here.We want to get Fox News senior correspondent Eric Shawn. He's going to give us some context on this impending bill right now in the Senate.Good morning, Eric.ERIC SHAWN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria, congressman, and good morning, everyone.So, how do we respond to this human catastrophe? Well, the choice seems to be balancing a humanitarian welcome with the fears of terrorism.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If you layer it with more and more bureaucracy that at -- doesn't actually make us safer because it doesn't do a better job of screening but simply makes it almost impossible to have process individuals who are coming in, then you're effectively ending the refugee program for people who desperately need it.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHAWN: We have been here before. Millions desperately fleeing turmoil for the safety of our American shores. During the Holocaust, this ship, the MS St. Louis was packed with 908 German Jewish refugees and was tragically turned back. Many of its passengers later died in Auschwitz and other concentration camps.But now the looming specter of terrorism is aimed at stopping or slowing the flow from Syria. Democratic minority leader, Senator Harry Reid, predicts Senate Democrats will block the new stricter measures, even as the president has promised that veto.But one of the lucky few who has made it is Hussam al Roustom. He fled with his wife and two young children from Homs, Syria, and was resettled in June in Jersey City, New Jersey, by the group, Church World Service.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HUSSAM AL ROUSTOM, SYRIAN REFUGEE (through translator): The individuals that putting their four or five children on boats through the -- through the sea and risking their lives, and death, this person can't be a terrorist.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHAWN: Al Roustom now works a 12 hour overnight shift in a Jersey bakery and he says he thankfully has a new start and a new life in our country.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)AL ROUSTOM: In my mind, and I made up my mind that that's it, I'm here now and I'm going to get acclimated here. I'm going to start my life from new here.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHAWN: Well, despite some successes, as you mentioned, Maria, polls show 67 percent of Americans oppose the resettling of Syrian refugees here and 1,682 have already arrived this year. The administration still plans to take that 10,000 next year.Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, Eric, thanks very much. Eric Shawn with the latest there.Taking the fight directly to ISIS and destroying the terrorist group once and for all. General Jack Keane is on deck next. Why the U.S. needs to wrap up its efforts and demonstrate real leadership.Follow us on Twitter @mariabartiromo, @sundayfutures. Let us know what you'd like to hear from General Jack Keane. He's coming up live next. Stay with us. We're looking ahead this morning on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.My next guest testified before Congress this week, advocating for a new strategy to destroy ISIS, arguing that air strikes can work, but not at the rate our military is conducting them.Joining us right now is General Jack Keane, retired four star general, chairman of the Institute for the Study of War, and former vice chief of staff of the Army and a Fox News military analyst.General, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.) FOUR STAR GENERAL: Good to be here, Maria.BARTIROMO: We just heard from Ed Royce, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, who said the strategy must be reversed and begun again to defeat ISIS. Tell us what the strategy should look like, general.KEANE: Yes, sure. Real quickly, I testified before Chairman Royce's committee this week and it was an honor to do that, along with the Homeland Security Committee. I mean, quite frankly, what we have to do is the president, when he said defeat ISIS, give him a check for that. When he said, we're going to rely on local indigenous forces as the ground force supported by air power, give them another check. But then, when we saw the execution, Maria, the execution of that was nothing near what it should be. We have to unleash America's air power, remove the restrictions we have on what we call the rules of engagement. It looks like Secretary Carter is beginning to take steps in that direction. That's good news.Secondly, once and for all, provide all the trainers, advisers and air controllers that those local indigenous forces require, that would take us from about 3,000 plus to about 10,000 plus. So we're going to triple down on -- on that capability.We have to mission the special forces so that they can conduct large scale in and out raids of critical nodes and infrastructure. This is combat. At night, using the element of surprise to do it. We also have to get all the equipment in that Chairman Royce was talking about. This is UAVs, Apaches, mine breaching equipment, Humvees, et cetera, that those local indigenous forces need, all in on that equipment once and for all. Safe zones in Syria, north and south, to be able to put the refugees there. We can protect them on (ph) international forces, on the ground and in the air.And then identify some units for eventual combat deployment, part of the Arab nation, NATO, U.S., down the road. If this strategy fails, then we have to go in the ground with those kind of combat units. And we have to get a political settlement in Syria if we're going to be able to defeat ISIS in Syria.BARTIROMO: Why is all of the above not being done right now, sir?KEANE: I think Chairman Royce was correct when he said that the president underestimated ISIS. I think he did this. And we can only speculate. I think he put a bet down that they would be able to contain ISIS, not destroy it, certainly not defeat it, and pass this problem to the next administration. The problem is, ISIS is not being contained, as we are all been talking about for a week plus now. They now have a global strategy that's unfolding right before their eyes, and they're expanding, not being contained, and they have to be defeated.So the president lost that bet. And now he's trying to scramble around to come up with something that is short of what's necessary. I suspect it will be another incremental step. Will -- it will remain to be seen what he's going to do.BARTIROMO: And it feels like the American people realize that, but the president seems out of touch with how the American people are feeling right now. Let me move on to Russia because in a world where you don't have U.S. leadership in front, there's a vacuum and that vacuum is filled. Right now it is being filled by Russia and Vladimir Putin. Explain to us the relationship between the U.S. and Russia and how you see it.KEANE: Well, right now, we have an -- obviously, a very strained relationship with Crimea, the Ukraine, his military intervention into Syria. We have a cooperative relationship in terms of our pilots. They have a common frequency to use so we can stay out of each other's way.But we should not enter into a cooperative agreement with Russia to attack Syria -- I mean to attack ISIS in Syria. And here's why. He's in there -- Putin is in there propping up the Alawite regime. This is Assad. We are never going to be able to defeat ISIS until there's a -- that war comes to an end because all the Sunnis that are fighting Assad, we need them to fight ISIS. That war has got to stop. That war is never going to stop as long as there are Alawites in charge of that regime. Those Sunnis will continue to fight.We cannot enter into a cooperative relation to go after ISIS with Russia because the payoff of that will be to sustain the Alawite regime in Syria.BARTIROMO: Right.KEANE: That's a trap we should not walk into.Secondly, it's a moral absurdity, Maria, because Russia and Iran have propped up Assad's killing machine. This problem we have in Europe in terms of migration and have 10,000 coming to the United States is a result of this killing machine for four years, 250,000 dead, 11 million people displaced, seven inside the country, four outside the country. Russia propped up all of that. We can't go down that road with Russia.BARTIROMO: Real quick, should we be letting in refugees? Is the vetting process credible? Really quickly, sir.KEANE: I think we can do both, let the refugees in and put together a -- a comprehensive vetting process that the Congress is suggesting. We can do both.BARTIROMO: General, thanks so much for your insights this morning. We so appreciate your time.KEANE: Good talking to you, Maria.BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon. General Jack Keane.Coming up next, he started at $20 million. Now Charles Koch is operating a $100 billion company and has had a big impact on the GOP money race. He'll explain why he has not yet supported a candidate. My exclusive interview with Charles Koch, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.At the most recent GOP debate, GOP presidential candidates told me spending cuts and tax reform are among the biggest priorities to improve the economy. Voters sharing similar feelings in this past Pew Research poll and 59 percent say they want Congress to completely change the federal tax system. Here now, billionaire industrialist Charles Koch reacting when he sat down with me last week in Palm Springs.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)CHARLES KOCH, CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF KOCH INDUSTRIES: That's one of the biggest problems in the country. We have debt and unfunded liabilities of over $100 trillion. We're headed for a financial cliff. And people want these programs, but they're not sustainable at this level. So -- so we -- it needs to be dealt with. And this isn't one party, this is both parties contributing to this irresponsible spending and waste.BARTIROMO: And -- and the big kahuna in all of this is the entitlements, Social Security --KOCH: Right.BARTIROMO: In particular. How do you think we actually move the needle on this? I mean what kind of changes do you think make sense?KOCH: Well, I think it -- we need to consider that -- that people are living longer and will live longer. And then we need to -- to allow innovation to occur, rather than all these regulations and other things that are stifling it, because if we do that, if we allow innovation, medicine can be practiced much more efficiently. Everything through economy can. But -- but we need to get rid of these misguided policies that are stifling these opportunities to make these fabulous improvements in everybody's life.BARTIROMO: I've got to ask you about, you know, you being enemy number one for -- for the Democratic Party. I mean, you know, money in -- your critics will say money in politics has really changed and made the system ugly. What do you say to people who are upset about money in politics?KOCH: Well, I -- I think that's a straw man. I think they're really upset about is that people are opposing their idea, which -- which I call the fatal concede and William Easterly (ph) called the tourney of the experts, is their -- their idea is a few of those philosopher kings and queens know better how people should live their lives than -- than people do, because people are either too evil or too stupid to run their own lives. But they have the wisdom to tell them how to live them, force them to -- to live that way. So I oppose that.So when -- when they say, we're trying to rig the system -- you know, we're trying to unrig the system. I'm putting the money in to change the system, to get the money out of the system. Like we -- we're hoping to raise $250 million for the elections, not just the presidential, but all the elections next year. You say, boy, that's a lot of money. And it is a tremendous amount. But you look at the hundreds of billions, maybe trillions that are going to support the -- the current system, like the corporate welfare, including the way the tax code works all the exemptions and privileges in that are estimated to be over $5 trillion.BARTIROMO: Charles, you -- you recently made an acquisition. You -- you -- you have been investing in biotech. Is this where you think the growth in the economy is in the next 10 years?KOCH: Well, I -- once again, I believe in the division of labor by comparative advantage (ph). Everybody needs to understand what their capabilities are and do that, not what's harder (ph) choice. But -- but -- but -- but we're investing heavily in -- in two new areas. One is biotechnology. That's biofuels. That's making chemicals with biological processes. That's better utilizing fertilizer and stimulating plant genes so they use less water and can withstand temperature changes better. So we're working all that (ph). The problem is to get approval to implement these things that -- that help everybody is so difficult now.BARTIROMO: Well, I think the regulatory environment has been one issue and the reason that businesses are not hiring more jobs and -- and creating more jobs rather.KOCH: And it's why the -- the median wage over the last eight years has actually declined. That's shocking because with all this technology, if it were allowed to be applied, the productivity of labor would go up and -- but we have this two-tiered system that the cronyists are making more money than ever and the -- the -- the disadvantaged people who have nothing and no say are being held down. And the worst thing is being unemployed because, as I said, is you don't learn these skills that you learn from taking any job. And -- and -- and the studies show, if you get a job and keep it, you won't stay in poverty long because if you apply yourself and you learn, you will advance.BARTIROMO: Why haven't you endorsed a candidate yet?KOCH: My view is the -- the -- the Democrats are taking us down the road to serfdom at 100 miles an hour and the Republicans are taking us there at 70 miles an hour. So they're both complicit in where we are and where we're headed. I don't support Democrats now because they're trying to destroy free speech in the market place of ideas, which is foundational to a free society. So whatever else they stand for, anybody who's going to do that, I can't support it in any way.But what I'm really looking for is -- is a -- a presidential candidate who will try to reverse that direction, rather than, OK, maybe they'd rather go 70 miles. They'll take us there at 60.  We need somebody like a Calvin Coolidge or a William Gladstone in Great Britain who will change the trajectory of the country.And -- and both of them created marvelous prosperity, improved the welfare system, helped the poor, made government more efficient.  I mean they -- they had to do radical things, like fire non-performers, get rid of the waste and corruption.I mean this is -- this is heavy lifting, because you've got a lot of vested interests that want to keep it that way.BARTIROMO:  Charles, thanks so much for joining us.KOCH:  Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO:  Charles Koch's new book, ""Good Profit,"" on store shelves now.President Obama says it would be shameful for the U.S. to vet refugees based on their religion.And now new Fox polling shows voters have a very strong opinion on the matter, as well.We'll tell you about it next.And when our panel joins us and we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.In the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks, some GOP candidates taking major heat for their stance on Syrian refugees, some of them floating the idea that the U.S. should give preference to Christians over Muslims.President Obama calls that idea ""shameful."" And according to a new Fox Poll, a solid majority of voters agree with him.Let's bring in our panel.  As you can see, this latest poll numbers.Ed Rollins is with me, former principal White House adviser to President Reagan.  He has been a long-time strategist to business and political leaders.  And he is a Fox News political analyst.Judith Miller, adjunct fellow at The Manhattan Institute for Policy Research.  She's a Pulitzer-Prize winning author and journalist and a Fox News contributor.And, ""The Wall Street Journal's"" editorial board member.Good to see everybody.Thanks very much for joining us.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:   Hi.BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on this past week.  Mary Kissel, let me kick it off with you.MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Well, Donald Trump, I think he is -- he effectively emotes, he doesn't articulate a strategy.  But he does say what a lot of people think, which I thought we have eyes, we saw what happened in Paris, we're afraid that it's going to happen here.  The polls reflect that.BARTIROMO:  Yes, the polls reflect that, but also, you have President Obama having been traveling all over the world, Ed Rollins.  And when he first made the comment that, you know, he basically, you know, like sort of pushed back at Republicans, it was a political response to an issue that Americans are really afraid of.ED ROLLINS, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  The president who is going to be above politics has been probably the most political president I've seen in my 50 years of politics.  He totally misses where the country is on this issue.  I think at the end of the day, we're all shocked and saddened by the Paris situation, but we also know it could help here.And I think the concern about the Syrian refugees and certainly I -- I think we have to have a humanitarian side to this.  But at the same time, 26 people were all basically came here and planned 9/11 and 19 of them got in the country and they knocked down to towers and tried to knock down the White House.  So...KISSEL:  But they did not come as refugees, Ed.  That's...ROLLINS:  But the issue...KISSEL:  -- to remember.ROLLINS:  -- the issue is how do we basically safeguard the people that are coming in here?We have no system and it's this -- the FBI and the CIA and Homeland Security cannot, at this point in time, guarantee who these people are going to be.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:   We've...ROLLINS:  So you invite them to come in and you bring 10,000 people into this country, knowing full well the Syrians are sending -- the terrorists are saying we want to get America next.MILLER:  We have a system.  It has worked.  We've had 2,174 Syrians come into this country since 9/11.  Not one of them has been arrested or deported because of terror-related activities.However, I agree with you, Ed, we have to be sure, now that ISIS is clearly targeting us and clearly trying to sneak people into the country, we have to be sure that our system is up to the test.And that's why...(CROSSTALK)KISSEL:  Well, I don't understand...(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  -- part of the problem.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:   We could be...(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I don't understand...KISSEL:  We could be welcoming of refugeesMILLER:  Exactly.KISSEL:  -- and yet prudent and reasonable about how we vet them.  I think that's what Paul Ryan tried to do with his House bill.  And I think it's simply unfair to characterize Americans, who are rightly worried about their security, as somehow bigots.Maria, very briefly, on the Christian issue, Christians are being targeted for genocide right now.  This isn't about prefencing Christians over other religious groups.  It's about doing what America has always done, which is to give shelter to those who are targets.(CROSSTALK)MILLER:  But I don't think we can have a religious test.  But what I don't understand why the president just didn't embrace the legislation to tighten the standards and make sure that everyone...(CROSSTALK)KISSEL:  You know why?Because he's trying to use...MILLER:  It's a no-brainer.KISSEL:  -- the refugee issue as a political wedge issue against Republicans.  We wouldn't have this refugee crisis if the president had gone into Syria, enforced the red line, targeted Assad's airfields.But he doesn't...MILLER:  That's right.KISSEL:  -- and now we have hundreds of thousands of people fleeing.MILLER:  That's a great point.ROLLINS:  The danger, though, is Trump and Carson are basically saying outrageous things.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:   Yes.ROLLINS:  There's no filter there.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:   They are.ROLLINS:  And we're going to have to live with this.  Jack Keane and both of your guests today, Chairman Royce and Jack Keane articulate exactly what the problem is and what we ought to seek as solutions.And Carson and Trump, who are the front of the pack here, have to be very careful what they say.BARTIROMO:  Well, they both really went specifics on the airstrikes so far, the fact that we are missing targets because of this politically correctness, frankly.ROLLINS:  We put our handcuffs on our -- we go out and say you can't have civilian casualties.  The whole premise -- and this goes back to my days in the Reagan administration -- we used to talk about we can't have civilian casualties.These people live in these camps...BARTIROMO:  Right.ROLLINS:  -- and the bottom line, you give them warning, we're going to bomb these camps, get out of there...MILLER:  And there is no excuse for not bombing supply lines and trucks...ROLLINS:  That's right.MILLER:  -- that were carrying oil that finances these operations out of Raqqah.  He has not been willing to do this.  He must step up and do it now.KISSEL:  Why?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:   This is not.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I don't understand.MILLER:  Because he does want to hand this over...ROLLINS:   The premise...MILLER:  -- to the next president.ROLLINS:  -- the premise that the truck drivers may be civilian drivers...UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:   He wants to posture on this.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:   Yes, he does.ROLLINS:  -- is absurd.  Anybody that's -- that's driving those trucks is not part of the enemy forces.(CROSSTALK)KISSEL:  This is like Bosnia.  I'm sorry...(CROSSTALK)KISSEL:  -- but you're not going to defeat ISIS with an air campaign.MILLER:  Yes, this is true.KISSEL:  We need to give protection to the Kurds.  We need to give the Sunnis a reason to ally with us.  And we need to dump the nuclear deal with Iran.Why is this president not getting Assad out of power?Because Assad is backed by Iran.  The president is giving political leverage to Tehran, to Moscow.  He hasn't -- he hasn't...(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO:  -- it's not one of his strategies, to win.(CROSSTALK)MILLER:  Mary, if you get rid of Assad right now, you will have Damascus go the way of Libya.  You will have no government there and no...KISSEL:  And you know what, this is...MILLER:  -- and no one to do a deal.KISSEL:  -- this is the reasoning...MILLER:  You need (INAUDIBLE)...KISSEL:  -- this is the reasoning of the Democrats all along.  We can't go in there because we're only going to make it worse.  We've been hearing it for three to four years now.  It gets worse and worse and worse and now terror is on our doorstep.MILLER:  I -- I have been...ROLLINS:  Well, we're not getting rid of Assad as long as...MILLER:  -- I've been...ROLLINS:  -- as long as Putin is backing him. And that's...MILLER:  That's right, and the Iranians. It's not going to happen.ROLLINS:  Putin has to negotiate that out.BARTIROMO:  Let me check in with ""MediaBuzz"" and Howie Kurtz, who's standing by right now, on at the top of the hour.Howie, good morning to you.HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS HOST, ""MEDIABUZZ"":  Good morning, Maria.We're going to drill down on how the Paris attacks have utterly transformed the coverage of the 2016 campaign, journalists speaking out in a more opinionated fashion, being much more aggressive toward President Obama, in a way we have rarely seen in this administration.And then, in a very different vein, the editor of the National Enquirer on how his supermarket tabloid forced Charlie Sheen to go on the ""Today"" show and acknowledge that he's HIV positive and whether Charlie Sheen told the truth to Matt Laurer.BARTIROMO:  Wow. We will see you in 20 minutes, Howie. Great show, we will be there. Thanks so much, Howard Kurtz.We've got brand-new polls showing how the GOP race is shaping up, how the candidates would fare against Hillary Clinton in a general election. We're going to bring those polls to you next. Back in a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO:  Welcome back. We've got these brand-new polls out this morning showing Donald Trump at the top of the GOP race once again. Take a look at these polls: Trump, 28 percent support, followed by Carson at 18 percent. Cruz and Rubio still doing well, 14 percent, even. Bush down there at 5 percent, Christie also at 3 percent.These poll numbers say it all. And this is after the ISIS conversation had become that much -- that much harsher.Ed Rollins?ROLLINS:  Trump clearly shows strength, and the country is looking desperately for strength, and they contrast it with a very weak president.So my sense is the -- the Paris disaster helped him because he was the guy out there saying it wouldn't happen on my watch. You know, whether that's true or not, regardless.And I think the guy who's really dropped off the charts is Carson, who clearly didn't know where the places were on the map, let alone who our allies were. And I think, to a certain extent, people are taking a second look at that.BARTIROMO:  This is interesting, you guys. This is how the candidates would fare against Hillary Clinton in this -- this most recent poll.This is just brand-new. We're showing this, this morning, for the first time. This is how the candidates would fare against Hillary Clinton in a general election. Mary?KISSEL:  Well, I think those polls reflect the post-Paris, that Americans want someone who's strong, who is going to defeat the terrorist threat and really wage the war on terror, not these half measures that President Obama has taken.Two things, Maria -- I think the next GOP debate is going to separate the professionals from the amateurs. I think Rand Paul should drop out of this race right now. I think Ted Cruz deserves to be scrutinized for voting against terrorist surveillance message and dumbing down and really restricting the information that the NSA has.And then, secondly, on the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton -- you've seen her already start to move to the right. She went from ""This is not America's fight"" in the last Democratic debate...BARTIROMO:  That's right.KISSEL:  ... to a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations where she's calling for President Obama's approach, plus a little more.Expect her to move farther to the right. It's important for Republicans to remind voters of what her record is of misjudging Putin, missing the Arab Spring, Benghazi, leading from behind in Libya, and all the other decisions that she's taken. But the Republicans have to remind the voters now before she moves to the center.BARTIROMO:  A lot of people, Judy, felt that her speech at the Council on Foreign Relations was a -- a third Obama term, that it was very much in step with what the president...MILLER:  I really disagree. When she talks about creating safe zones, those are Republican ideas now. These have come from the Republican candidates. She is moving to the right.BARTIROMO:  OK.MILLER:  She is moving to where she naturally is. What was unnatural for Hillary Clinton was to be President Obama's very weak secretary of state.BARTIROMO:  So why didn't she resign?(LAUGHTER)MILLER:  You don't resign when you're secretary of state.(CROSSTALK)MILLER:  What is Hillary Clinton's natural position? I'd refer everybody to former defense secretary Bob Gates' book, where he says that she made her vote against the surge in Iraq based on politics. Politics is what Hillary Clinton is about. There is no principle there. And that's why she would be such a dangerous president.ROLLINS:  Let's -- let's not misunderstand. We've talked about her moving to the right. She is not moving to the right. She's moving a little bit to the center. She was out there with Bernie Sanders, who is...(LAUGHTER)... is a socialist.(CROSSTALK)ROLLINS:  That's as far left as you can get.KISSEL:  No, right from all the way on the left, yeah.ROLLINS:  She's a little bit to the right of Obama, but she's certainly not to where her husband to was, and she's certainly not to where our defense people want her to be.And I don't -- I think, at the end of the day, she sees -- she can read polls. Every one of these people are beating her, including Trump and Carson. So at the end of the day, she's got to basically do something to adjust that presents herself as a leader, not the third term.MILLER:  Ed, she was in favor of arming Syrian moderates -- quote, ""moderates"" -- pragmatists, whatever we want to call them, three years ago, and her president said, ""No, I'm not going to do that,"" against the advice of his military.ROLLINS:  She's also running away from her vote on Iraq.MILLER:  Yes, she -- she...ROLLINS:  At the end of the day, you know, she basically is going to do whatever is political, and at the end of the day...MILLER:  Such a surprise...(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)KISSEL:  Is she disavowing the Iran nuclear deal? No. she's not.(CROSSTALK)KISSEL:  Yeah, and is she -- is she calling for a major troop presence on the ground to protect the Kurds and the Sunnis in Iraq? Is she calling for a comprehensive strategy like the one General Keane just outlined? No, she's not.I'd look to Republicans like Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina. These are the people who are outlining the kind of combined political and military strategy that we need to defeat this threat.This is an apocalyptic cult that stretches from North Africa to the Middle East to Afghanistan and into -- into parts of Asia. This is the fight of our time. And we need someone with a strategy...MILLER:  And are you going to fight that alone without the Russians and without the Iranians?KISSEL:  I don't think the Russians and the Iranians have our interests in mind. They're not our allies.MILLER:  We have one point of common interest, the need to defeat ISIS. Diplomacy is all about making coalition when your interests coincide.(CROSSTALK)ROLLINS:  I don't want to give up all my objections to the Russians on Ukraine and everything else that they have done simply to have a soul mate in this battle against ISIS.If the U.S. basically wants to do this and do this alone, we can do it. We have our other allies, France and other European allies who will join us with this. And I think, at the end of the day, we need to commit to what it is that it will take. Our people in the Pentagon have been telling this president over and over again what he needs to do.BARTIROMO:  Why is he not listening?ROLLINS:  Because he doesn't...MILLER:  He never has.KISSEL:  Look, it is not in Iran's interest to defeat ISIS in Iraq. It gives Iran an excuse to stay in Iraq. The idea that Putin is coming in and helping us in Syria is a fiction and a fantasy. He is bombing our few allies that we have left in Syria.BARTIROMO:  Because he's trying to support Assad, and...MILLER:  That's the negotiation you have with him. You say to him, you want to be part of this coalition, you stop bombing moderates...BARTIROMO:  How do we trust him when we distrust Putin?MILLER:  Trust has nothing to do with it, Maria, verification. This is where Russian and American interests coincide, one of the few areas.And by the way, if they're involved in Syria, it's very hard to also be fighting at the same time in Ukraine.KISSEL:  Oh, is Putin going to get out of -- get out of Ukraine?ROLLINS:  No...MILLER:  He's not going to get out of Ukraine...(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO:  ... on conflict. Putin needs conflict in order to look like a tough guy.MILLER:  He's got enough.ROLLINS:  He is a tough guy.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO:  He certainly is a tough guy. Good point.We'll be right back. More from our panel, as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" right now.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO:  Welcome back. French President Francois Hollande is coming to the United States this week, for a meeting at the White House on Tuesday. Then he heads to Moscow to meet with Russian President Putin.How could this change things? Could the tragedy in Paris bring about better relations with Russia?I want to bring back our panel, Ed Rollins, Judy Miller, Mary Kissel.Are you guys expecting anything to come out of this meeting with Hollande and President Obama on Tuesday, Judy?MILLER:  I think they are going to say the obvious things. This is Hollande's 9/11 moment. He knows he has to appear strong to his own people. He will do a deal with Obama to work together to defeat ISIS, and then he will go to Moscow and do exactly the same thing.BARTIROMO:  What kind of deals? I'm so...(LAUGHTER)I mean, as a viewer, as someone on the outside looking in, I'm so tired of these deals being done. I just want to get and defeat ISIS. And I feel that Americans are afraid after what happened in Paris.ROLLINS:  We're not -- they are afraid and they should be afraid. And at the end of the day, Obama is not going to do what his own military wants to do or what his own CIA wants to do or what his Homeland Security wants to do.So the French can come over here and have a nice meeting, drink tea and all the rest of it, but at the end of the day, we're not going to give him what he wants and we're not going to basically make a deal that -- that basically empowers the Russians.So the Russians are going to basically get in bed with the French. It will enhance Putin, and I think we'll sit by the sidelines again, unless people like Jack Keane, the congressman who was on, the chairman here -- they're the ones that are going to push this thing, and at the same time that, overwhelmingly, the Congress passes, in the House, a bill; Harry Reid basically says, no way, I'm not going to take it up.BARTIROMO:  They're going to -- they're going to veto it? They're going to block it in the Senate?ROLLINS:  Well, not even take it up, not even take it up.BARTIROMO:  Mary?KISSEL:  This is the most detached, clinical, bloodless president I have ever seen. He was in Asia this week talking about how he's not afraid, and really attacking Republicans as if Republicans were the enemy and not ISIS.I think it's notable that we didn't invoke Article V after the Paris attacks. I think that probably didn't happen because there was probably a phone call from the Obama administration to the French saying don't ask us for this.There's no change in strategy out of the White House. I think this visit is a formality. And Francois Hollande is starting to look like George W. Bush...(LAUGHTER)... doing air strikes without asking permission, trying to gather together a coalition. But it says something profoundly disturbing that our ally, the French, feel that they have to go to Vladimir Putin to ask for assistance. That tells you how topsy-turvy and backyard U.S. policy has been under this president.BARTIROMO:  And you say go back to the speech in Cairo?KISSEL:  Back in June 2009, President Obama, recall, made his first major speech where he came apologizing for America to the heart of the Muslim world. And he said, quote, ""So let me be clear. No system of government can or should be imposed upon one nation by any other.""And that told you everything that you needed to know about this president and his view of the world, that there was a moral equivalence there, that somehow America wasn't -- was just like other nations; we weren't that shining nation on the hill. And you see the consequence of that now, of America's retreat from the world and the vacuum that it's created in the global disorder that we have today.BARTIROMO:  We're going to take a short break, and we've got more, coming back. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO:  Welcome back. Big thank you to our panel today. Thank you so much for joining us. I'll see you tomorrow morning on the Fox Business Network. That will do it for us today on ""Sunday Morning Futures."" Have a great day, everybody. I'll be on FBN at 6 a.m. tomorrow.Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.

"This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" April 4, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone, I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle along with Juan Williams, Eric Bolling, Dana Perino and Brian Kilmeade. It is 5 o'clock in New York City and this is the ""The Five."" It's Monday, April 4th, the eve of yet another pivotal showdown in this long and arduous fight for the GOP nomination. Wisconsin decides tomorrow, and the state could determine whether the republicans are headed to a contested convention. It's a battle around both Cruz and Trump, can't afford to lose. Kasich already admits he won't be winning it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And what we're seeing all across the state is an example really of what we're seeing across the country. We're seeing republicans unite. We're seeing republicans coming together with a spirit of unity. And the energy we're seeing here in Wisconsin is tremendously encouraging.DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If we do well here, folks, it's over. If we don't win here, it's not over, but wouldn't you like to take the credit in Wisconsin for ending it?(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Give Wisconsin the credit for ending it, and then we could focus on Hillary, instead of these two guys.GOV. JOHN KASICH, R-OHIO, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm up 14 points on Hillary in Wisconsin, and I'm going to lose in Wisconsin. OK? This is really unbelievable. Isn't it? How this whole process is going, but persevere, 38 percent of the people in Wisconsin, don't know who I am.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: It's quite interesting, that's why ratings are through the roof. So Eric, what do you make of it? Wisconsin's tomorrow pivotal could end some of this kind of disarray, but not necessarily looking like that is going to happen.ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: I'm not sure that's right that Wisconsin is the end all, even if Donald Trump does win Wisconsin. Remember, you have those big states in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania coming up in the northeast. And John Kasich, if he stays in, may get some of those delegates, and that will put a damper on Trump or Cruz ever getting -- I don't think Cruz is getting to 1237. There still the only likely -- I would say possible path to 1237 would be Trump, so he does do a lot better if he gets Wisconsin, and gets Wisconsin in a big way. But right now the polls have flip-flopped on that both ways. Trump was leading then Cruz was leading, the latest ones they have Trump back on top. But whatever, who knows where it's going to go. Wisconsin is important, though. Wisconsin is huge in other respects. Wisconsin has Scott Walker, who ran for president. Wisconsin has Paul Ryan who everyone thinks, if there's a contested convention and they play around with the rules in the rules committee, then they -- another party who's not running for president right now could be called, in maybe it's Paul Ryan, he could be the one that they're looking at. So Wisconsin has played a big role. Play -- it plays big role in prior primaries. Some would say it's the birth place of the Republican Party too, so all eyes in Wisconsin for now.GUILFOYLE: All right. Dana Perino, what is your assessment. Give us your very best right now.DANA PERINO,  CO-HOST: I think that's right. So the Trump had been on top in the polls early on in the contest, and then that's changed. And I think consistently all the polls show with Cruz with either a slight lead or a substantial one.BOLLING: No, no, no. There's a new one out today that --PERINO: That Reuters had one the Trump up.BOLLING: . Trump back up -- yeah.PERINO: OK so -- OK?GUILFOYLE: Go ahead. I was just -- I was agreeing with Eric.GUILFOYLE: OK.PERINO: Except for the Paul Ryan part. I think that everyone thinking that Paul Ryan is going to be running for president is not accurate, and I just think that there are a lot of people pushing that theme. He is not pushing it, in trying to try to tell people, I'm the umpire of the convention. He doesn't plan to run for president, doesn't plan to be recruited for it, and is not lobbying for it.GUILFOYLE: And he's doing quite a fine job as the House speaker. I might say so myself. Hello, Brian.BRIAN KILMEADE, GUEST CO-HOST: Nice to see you, Kimberly. I'm glad you're back from vacation.GUILFOYLE: Yes.KILMEADE: How long have you been gone, three, four weeks?GUILFOYLE: Yes, exactly.KILMEADE: What's going on?GUILFOYLE: Didn't feel like that?KILMEADE: It really did.GUILFOYLE: It's all like that.KILMEADE: I counted it every minute.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.KILMEADE: A lot's changed and we had a time to dwell.GUILFOYLE: OK.KILMEADE: We have to dwell looking up to Wisconsin. And after this, we're going to have two more weeks to dwell. So you're talking about momentum. So we're going to focus on Wisconsin, leading up to Wisconsin, and after Wisconsin, leading up to New York. I think there are few things, that memo that leaked out to me was very telling, when it comes out inside the very lean Trump camp that they are upset at the establishment, they are upset with how many times that they're being attacked. They seem to be doubling down and feeling as though they're playing the victim somewhat. And I also gonna was telling over the weekend where Donald Trump said, ""Hey, you know what, if i could do it again, I wouldn't retweeted that image. If I could do it again, I would have answered the abortion question different. That's the first time we saw a reflective -- somewhat reflective candidate. Are you seeing some growth? I mean that's going to be the key. Are you seeing any change?GUILFOYLE: All right. Juan, how did you see that particular moment?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Which particular?GUILFOYLE: What he's saying about retweeting and taking issue have done yet.WILLIAMS: Oh, well I think that you know, we talked about this a little bit.GUILFOYLE: Reflection.WILLIAMS: . that I think it was a moment when you first time you saw Trump say, hey, I made a mistake there and back up a little bit, and that was different for Trump. But what I think is going on in Wisconsin is one; I think Paul Ryan's name might as well be on the ballot, because I think there are a lot of people in Wisconsin who like Paul Ryan, of course, he's the hometown hero. And then you see Trump go to Janesville, his hometown and take him on. And you see Ryan in Washington giving a speech, in which he said, ""This campaign on the republican side, out of control. We don't need to be vulgar. We don't need to be rude to each other. That's not good politics, that doesn't win you votes, that doesn't win elections."" So Ryan says he doesn't want it. He says he's not campaigning for it. But if you stop and think about how this -- the GOP establishment has lined up behind Cruz here. And I'm going, not only Scott Walker, I'm going to Jeb Bush. I'm going to Carly Fiorina. I could go and on. And the money that's coming against Trump in Wisconsin, they have focused --KILMEADE: Club for growth as one.WILLIAMS: Club for growth. And now, even the Planned Parenthood people are in there taking on --BOLLING: Can I game that out?WILLIAMS: Of course, go ahead, man.BOLLING: So the GOP establishment gets behind Ted Cruz.WILLIAMS: Yes, sir.BOLLING: Because they don't want to get Trump to 1237, for what end is though? So they get to a brokered convention because they want Ted Cruz?WILLIAMS: No.BOLLING: Of course not.WILLIAMS: Of course. I'm sorry, I thought there really was.BOLLING: But the rules right now say, unless you changed. And the rules right now and say.KILMEADE: Right.BOLLING: . you need to win eight states with a majority.GUILFOYLE: Right.WILLIAMS: Right.BOLLING: . in order to be on the first ballot. So what they're hoping for is a second ballot, so they can nominate Kasich or Ryan.WILLIAMS: Well Ryan -- I mean Boehner, John Boehner, the former speaker, who Ryan replaced has said, you know what, if the three guys running don't win 1237, then it's an open convention, and he wants Paul Ryan.KILMEADE: Wow, interesting. I also think it is kind of interesting. And I think he could appreciate this thing is that whatever you think about the presidency of Barack Obama in '08, he was so organized, he had a great message. His camp was ready to go. They ran a better campaign. Ted Cruz is running the most organized campaign. He's stealing delegates. Today the story is he's back in Arizona trying to steal delegates. He's trying to grab Rubio's delegates. He's gonna go with Dakota's stealing delegates. He's playing the game. Donald Trump maybe got his wakeup call, let's see if he can catch up, but it is Cruz who is built to win.BOLLING: Stealing delegates for a later vote. Now, could the first vote.KILMEADE: Right.BOLLING: . he can't get them.KILMEADE: He's preparing for a rainy day like today.BOLLING: But here's the question.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: All these delegates that have decided to go behind -- to get behind Ted Cruz, because they don't want Donald Trump. Will they stay with Ted Cruz on the second ballot or will they going to go to John Kasich or someone else who's nothing?KILMEADE: The best chance he has is getting in there and telling them why you should stay with them. Making those delegates feel like they matter. You know he's got a plane, and he doesn't have a plane and a chopper, but he might be able to say, ""Listen, this is who I am, I hope you're going to count on me. He's trying to plow the ground.GUILFOYLE: Well they -- but they both have strategies, and in particular, you know Trump is actually hoping to recover from a rough week on the campaign trail. He acknowledged some missteps on Fox News Sunday and vowed that you're going to see a different side of him if he becomes the nominee.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Was this my best week, I guess not. I could have done without the retweet, et cetera, et cetera. But --CHRIS WALLACE, HOST, ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY"": But I'm talking about --TRUMP: I think I'm doing OK.WALLACE: Any plans to lay off the personal attacks?TRUMP: After I beat them, I'm going to be so presidential you're going to be so bored. You're going to say, this is the most boring human being I've ever interviewed.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: OK, so this is Trump.KILMEADE: Hot.GUILFOYLE: . with a different tune like we were discussing earlier.KILMEADE: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Kind of a little bit more reflective saying that he's going to have a different approach, attitude, perhaps, you know if he gets the nomination, and if in fact he wins the presidency. Dana.PERINO: Well, it's very hard to make a -- you can't make a first impression over and over again. The impression has been made. There are some people that adore Donald Trump; they will go to the matt for him. They are always going to vote for him, no matter what. And there are others that have decided -- that they have made a judgment that they will never vote for him. Then there are others who was like, well, even if they were on the fence now, if you look at the polls, there were like -- I don't think so. I actually think that he should just be himself. And that actually for -- if you're looking for a nominee, just be who you are, and don't always think that you're going to be somebody else, if something happens.KILMEADE: But Dana, don't you think you can be yourself and still have a Dana Perino working with you saying OK, you're about to go into Chris Matthews interview. Here's what to expect, Mr. President.PERINO: Absolutely.KILMEADE: Or Mr. Trump.PERINO: Absolutely.KILMEADE: So that's what I'm saying. If he is going to be himself, he could do it with communications people around him. Right now he went --PERINO: Not always. Not at lot -- I mean, you can have great communications people, but it comes from the top, so you can prep in somebody for an interview, over and over again. But when they walk in there, that's them, it's not the communications people's fault. That is your.KILMEADE: But I wouldn't blame.PERINO: . support staff.KILMEADE: But right now, if you listen to the way, if you read the story about what makes up Donald Trump's team of 94, compared to 760 for Hillary Clinton, it's too lean. I think he would have said -- he's the business expert, he's got to assess the situation. Yeah, I saved a lot of money, but I shouldn't be saving any money anymore. I have to get communications experts in with me, to brief me on things I couldn't possibly know.WILLIAMS: And this is what's going on. Some of it you touched on earlier, Brian, which is he's brought in Paul Manafort, and why? Because he's now understands that there's a game --KILMEADE: Yup.WILLIAMS: An invisible game going on for those delegates. So he brought in someone who's an old wise man of Washington republican politics to play the game. He's even thinking about suing in Louisiana.KILMEADE: Yeah. Yes, it's true.WILLIAMS: Because somehow he wins Louisiana.KILMEADE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: Cruz gets more delegates. He's saying, what's going with this thing?KILMEADE: Right.WILLIAMS: So I was on ABC last -- yesterday, and they said --KILMEADE: You did great, by the way. I watched it.WILLIAMS: You're very kind. So they say worst week ever for Trump. Well, Barry Bennett number comes out and says, ""That's spin from the establishment.""KILMEADE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: The media is part of the establishment that's anti-Trump, he makes the case. And it's both now, Trump and Cruz, that not only say Kasich should be out, they want to make sure, to Eric's point, that he's not on the ballot at the convention. So now it's everything is against Kasich. And Kasich, for his point, I love his quote. He said, ""An open convention -- so cool.""(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: That was so cool.KILMEADE: And good for the kids.WILLIAMS: It's so cool.KILMEADE: It's good for the kids.BOLLING: It's so why Cruz who wants Kasich out. Cruz needs Kasich in there. It's just to ensure that.KILMEADE: Right.BOLLING: . he gets some any sort of proportional delegates.WILLIAMS: He thinks he's losing votes in Wisconsin to Kasich.BOLLING: Yeah, OK. But he needs him go down the road.GUILFOYLE: But beyond that, yeah.WILLIAMS: Yeah.BOLLING: . to make sure that Trump doesn't get to 1,237. I also watch the every single Sunday show, this weekend. I saw you, you did a great job. We the people, check out his book. It was -- very fascinating to me to see Reince Priebus on.KILMEADE: Every channel.BOLLING: . at every single channel, every single one.KILMEADE: Yeah, everyone.WILLIAMS: Everyone.BOLLING: Explaining this rules saying, which I'm not sure I even buy what they're selling us right now. I have -- I've read these rules, I have them right here. I read them four times. I'm still trying to work --KILMEADE: They're the old rules anyway. They're gonna rewrite the rules.BOLLING: Yeah. Well, they can. The Rule 42 says.WILLIAMS: Yup.BOLLING: . at rules 26 through 42 are temporary, which means they can rewrite them. Guess where the rule about the delegates falls? Rule 42, Rule 40 of 42. So it's temporary -- whatever. Here's a point. It struck me as this. I see two parties, the GOP establishment and the Donald Trump party. Instead of one party, this stage in the game and any other race, the party that was -- the guy who didn't -- you're backing a candidate who's not the nominee or going to be the nominee, you jump in line, you form in line because you want to take on Hillary Clinton, right?GUILFOYLE: Yeah. You're right.WILLIAMS: But these report --BOLLING: This is a bifurcated Republican Party right now.WILLIAMS: Yes, it's actually. But currently --BOLLING: And it's horrible to its part.WILLIAMS: Yes. But wait a minute, wait a minute. I think it's like close to three quarters of republicans aren't voting for Trump, right?BOLLING: Well, that would make 98 percent of mark voting for Cruz, 98 percent of mark voting for Kasich. It's the same.WILLIAMS: OK.GUILFOYLE: But the end result is what? All this division and fracturing is doing one thing, and it's serving to make sure that Hillary Clinton is the next.BOLLING: Hillary. Correct.GUILFOYLE: . president of the United States.BOLLING: Correct.GUILFOYLE: So think about that, if you can, at night, if you're not frightened and be terrified, like it scares me.KILMEADE: All right.GUILFOYLE: OK. Next, the democratic battle for Wisconsin, Hillary Clinton has another tough fight ahead of her tomorrow. She's setting up for attacks against Sanders as she reveals she's not taking the nomination for granted. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Hillary Clinton's bracing for another tough fight tomorrow in Wisconsin. She's trailing Sanders by three points there, according to the RealClearPolitics average. And in two weeks, she's going to face Sanders in her home state of New York, where she fares better, ahead by about 11 points. Although Clinton has the upper hand with delegates, she's lost five of the last six contests to Sanders, so she knows that the battle goes on.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am going to do everything I can to win in as many places as possible. We have a system, and I'm very confident that I will be the nominee, but I'm not taking anything or any place or anyone for granted.(CROSSTALK)(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: The secretary is continuing to push back against Sanders so-called lies about her record on fossil fuels and other issues.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: When people make these kinds of claims, which now I think have been debunked. Actually, ""The Washington Post"" said three Pinocchio's, ""New York Times"" also analyze. And other independent analysts have said that they are misrepresenting my record. I just not gonna -- I feel sorry sometimes for the young people who, you know, believe this. They don't do their own research. And I'm glad that we now can point to reliable independent analysis to say, no, it's just not true.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Brian, fair to say that Hillary Clinton did not expect that in -- going into April into Wisconsin that she was still going to have a Bernie Sanders problem. But it seems like it's a significant one.KILMEADE: Dana, she's ticked off if you listen to her speeches. Have you saw what happened with the blowup on that line? She has saying to herself, how did I have this happen. I got this huge organization. I game plan this entire thing out. And she finally is going at Bernie Sanders where the republicans are going at themselves. And they should say, OK, what do I have in an opponent? 74-years-old became a democrat yesterday, and has an economic program that's totally not feasible. And we have -- what promising free college to people, we can possibly fulfill that. Can you possibly tell me how you plan on giving this next generation everything for free?GUILFOYLE: Yeah.KILMEADE: While not raising taxes, while taking 8 out of every 10 dollars? She's finally picking at the weak parts of his candidacy, taking it seriously.PERINO: They don't want to hear that message. I mean, it's something like 80 percent of young people, Eric, Juan, are voting for Sanders over Hillary Clinton. If you take all the average of the exit polls and he raised $44 million in March, so he out raised her by $15 million end of last month.BOLLING: He out raised her. He is liked by young people. He's the, you know, he's the SNL star. He's got something going on. I just don't think that -- it's in the books where -- I think the books are cooked for her, because it's the mechanism.GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: It's the apparatus, the infrastructure. She's got a whole lockdown.KILMEADE: The super delegates.BOLLING: As super delegates --GUILFOYLE: But somehow they think he's like groovy hipster socialist.BOLLING: And they'll come, they'll come back to the northeast, because she's going to have a lot of, you know, a lot of influence in the northeast. Look, it is fun to watch. The whole thing is fun to watch on both sides. You get -- Sanders is a likeable guy. You like Bernie Sanders.GUILFOYLE: That he's trying to portray him as lion Bernie --BOLLING: I wish lion Bernie was their nominee, because there will be not a socialist president in America.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. And all the Saturday nights are big, right? On Saturday Night Live you'll be able to see all the skid.KILMEADE: Oh, yes. You will know who you can get.GUILFOYLE: But people like him. All you get if you like him, like I said, oh, I know, he seems kind of nice guy. Yeah, OK, great. So you know what he stands for, and you're fine with having like Venezuela style socialism and milking that toilet paper and taking home about, like a buck out of every 10 that you make. That's cool, right? (inaudible) -- Yeah.KILMEADE: This orange -- to have orange juice --BOLLING: Nine out of every 10. You keep a bulk of your own.GUILFOYLE: No. That's what I said, you take home only $1.BOLLING: Oh, it was good.PERINO: But Juan --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: We talk about GOP divisions a lot. But what about within the Democratic Party, is there a worry that if and when Bernie Sanders does not become the nominee, that his voters have been very energize in their primary to stay home in the generals?WILLIAMS: Yeah. Well, in fact, that's what the polls show, there's a large percentage about a third, according to Wall Street Journal. But then I saw another poll the other day that showed that again, similar margin of people who are Bernie or bust. If it was not Bernie, I'm not playing, because they don't, they don't feel. According to the analysis of the polls, they don't feel that Hillary Clinton is anything but a status quo candidate. She would be just an ordinary average president. They see Sanders, and he could use this word as revolutionary.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Versus an establishment Hillary Clinton.WILLIAMS: He wants (inaudible) the system, that he thinks it's weighed in against -- especially young people who are burdened by college costs, college debt. You know, living in the parents -- but they see Bernie as their guy. Now the thing that you said, that just jumps out at me, unbelievable, how much money? I mean, supposedly, Bernie Sanders is like, you know, just hanging in there. No, $44 million in one month.PERINO: In fact, people started -- some democrats started asking him if he was going to start using some of that money to help them in their House Senate races.WILLIAMS: Well, that's the thing. That's what -- because to your point Brian, that he -- she is now saying, this guy is not even a democrat. I've been a lifelong democrat.KILMEADE: It's true.WILLIAMS: I'll campaign for democrats. I'll raise money for democrats. Bernie has never said anything like that.GUILFOYLE: She's got to start like, you know, crushing him. This is -- it's enough already. It's not amusing.KILMEADE: You know who said that Bill Clinton, he's saying it was such a huge mistake not to crush him early.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.KILMEADE: They didn't take him seriously. And New York Times, were yesterday talked about how the Sanders campaign is kicking themselves for not getting off to a better start. As if they didn't know, they get this close.PERINO: They should have talked about her darn e-mails. That would help.(LAUGHTER)KILMEADE: Still --PERINO: They actually --KILMEADE: Still has not brought it up.PERINO: And they're also having a big -- they're having a debate over a debate. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Look, she has proposed three dates, we have proposed four dates. She has a difficult schedule. I've got a difficult schedule. You know, one of the dates proposed was the night of the NCAA finals, didn't make sense to me. But I think that we will reach an agreement. People of New York deserve to hear us discussing the important issues, facing that state, and facing the country. I suspect it will work out.HILLARY: We offered dates which they refused. You offered -- GMA offered a debate during GMA on Friday the 15th, I'll be there. I think it's a great opportunity to reach an audience that may not always be able because of other obligations to tune to debate. I want to debate, and I'm confident that we can work out a time to do that.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: So Eric, when they're debating about a debate, what are they really fighting about?BOLLING: I don't think either of them wants to do it. I don't think Hillary wants to do it and they're both -- they probably don't want to do it, right? So they going to say, oh, I have a date and you have the date, it didn't line up with the NCAA, and what now? But don't forget, there's 14 days between Wisconsin and New York. You have 14 days to pick one hour -- let's call it two hours max. And get this thing; the people of New York do deserve to hear it. But I will tell you, I don't really like the democrat stuff, I still watch it. I think that one, before New York would be fantastic with all the ""wall Street"" stuffs, with all the Goldman Sachs stuff, with all the millionaires.KILMEADE: Right.BOLLING: . and billionaires on Bernie, it will be great.KILMEADE: Chuck Todd totally let her off the hook yesterday. When Chuck said, ""Why do you release your transcript?"" And she's like, ""I'm really great against ""Wall Street,"" I'm good."" Excuse me. Chuck Todd would have been indefatigable if it was Trump or Cruz.GUILFOYLE: Good work.KILMEADE: He let it go.WILLIAMS: All right.KILMEADE: He let it go, actually.WILLIAMS: Let's just say this that I know Kimberly thinks the world of Bernie Sanders, you say he's such a wonderful guy, and we here, at this table, at ""The Five"" will put you next to Kimberly Guilfoyle, you can sit next to Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: We want you on the set. And also, I'm going to say --GUILFOYLE: So you're inviting him to ""The Five?""WILLIAMS: Absolutely.GUILFOYLE: Where are you sitting? Right here --WILLIAMS: No, no, I'll protect you. But I will let him sit here, because (inaudible). And then, Hillary Clinton can sit right next to Eric Bolling. That's right.BOLLING: OK.WILLIAMS: You're like --BOLLING: On a different day, or the same day?WILLIAMS: The same day if you want. We all have a debate here on ""The Five.""BOLLING: ""The Five"" debate.GUILFOYLE: Juan just went rogue.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: No, no, no. I think --KILMEADE: It's an offer.WILLIAMS: It's a different thing.KILMEADE: It's an offer.WILLIAMS: What do you think about --?PERINO: I think having them would be great.WILLIAMS: Yes.PERINO: And if -- I hope that they would take us up on it. I mean, Bernie Sanders.KILMEADE: Brooklyn boy.PERINO: . gets a lot of love at this table.KILMEADE: Yeah. He's a Brooklyn boy.WILLIAMS: No.KILMEADE: He wants this debate.WILLIAMS: He said he loves the people at this table, but don't like Hillary.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: All right, we're going to move on. Hillary Clinton believes in constitutional rights for all, but that doesn't extend to babies not yet born. Hear her comments over the weekend that stirred up both sides of the abortion debate next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: According to Hillary Clinton, she's America's champion for human rights.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: We have to keep up with every fiber of our being, the argument for the campaign for human rights, human rights as women's rights.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Human rights as gay rights, human rights as workers' rights, human rights as voting rights, human rights across the board for every single American.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Hmm, but not all Americans have rights according to Hillary -- the unborn don't.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Well, under our laws, currently, that is not something that exists. The unborn person doesn't have constitutional rights. Now -- it doesn't mean that you don't do everything possible to try to fulfill your obligations, but it -- it does not include sacrificing the woman's right to make decisions. And I think that's an important distinction that under Roe v. Wade, we've had enshrined under our constitution.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: While trying to take down Trump for his abortion comments, Clinton revealed she doesn't believe children in the womb have any right at all, and Bernie Sanders agrees with her.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SANDERS: I believe that it is an outrage that Republicans who tell us how much they hate the government now want to tell every American -- every American woman what she can and cannot do with her body. And I do agree with the secretary. I don't believe there's any constitutional protection for the unborn.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Dana, your thoughts on -- I mean, is she going to have to clarify what she was saying?PERINO: Well, I don't think so, but she should be asked a different question.GUILFOYLE: What is it?PERINO: Technically, she's correct that under the law as it is, that an unborn person doesn't have those rights. Now, there's been moves to try to change that, and the question she should be asked, in particular, is about late-term abortion. Because science now says that about 22 to 23 weeks of pregnancy, that the baby then should be able to survive on its own.The issue on late-term or partial-birth abortion has been whether or not you think that that should be illegal, now that science tells us that that unborn fetus, that actually could survive outside of the womb, should that have constitutional rights? I believe that it should.And I -- what Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are trying to do is basically, unfortunately, Donald Trump's comments last week, played into this liberal stereotype about conservatives, that they basically want to tell women, you're no longer going to be able to have legal abortions.When the pro-life movement, for decades, have been trying to say, we don't want to punish women. We want to have a protection of life from birth to natural death. That is what a culture of life is supposed to mean.But the issue on the table for all Democrats I think she should be uncomfortable with, and Bernie Sanders should be, is about late-term abortion. That is the issue that's been on -- been debated on Capitol Hill. It's come close to passing in the Senate, and I think that they should be asked about that at the next debate and grilled on it.BOLLING: K.G., Dana points out from birth to natural death. Natural death is defined as when the heart stops and there's no brain activity, right?GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: And that birth doesn't -- life doesn't -- if that's death, why isn't life determined by when there's a heartbeat and there's brain activity?GUILFOYLE: Well, you're talking to someone who believes that -- that it should, in fact. And I mean, and how can you not, in good conscience, evaluate this, based honestly, based on the current state of medicine and science and honor life. You know, you honor people who are walking around outside, et cetera. What about, you know, babies in the womb that, if then they leave the womb, they're able to survive on their own?BOLLING: Right.GUILFOYLE: How is this any kind of distinction that makes sense morally, ethically, and now I believe, yes, the challenge should be legal.KILMEADE: You know, John Paul Horace (ph) said that, which -- he heard they're equal to Donald Trump's gaffes for the pro -- for the pro-choice community. And basically, she used the wrong term. The right terms are fetus and embryo. Don't make it seem real. Don't say the word ""unborn.""And also, she offered some -- opened up some restrictions for third trimester, and we're not into that. The pro-choice are saying, ""You've got to be kidding me. We're really upset with her."" I think as a grandmother, you see so many sonograms and you think to yourself, ""Man, I don't know if, with a clear conscience, how long I can keep this school of thought.""PERINO: That's true. Great point.WILLIAMS: First, the whole thing was that she used the term ""person"" -- all right -- and attached ""person"" to a fetus. And that for the -- for the people who are pro-choice or pro-abortion in this country is breaking with their language and their logic in just the way that Trump did last week.BOLLING: God forbid you call a fetus a person. Don't -- don't attach too much emotion and then thought to it. That's what's going on.WILLIAMS: No, no, no. This is about a semantic battle here. This is about very political stuff.GUILFOYLE: But they're playing semantic gymnastics with life.PERINO: I think it's actually -- I think it's actually moral. And it's also legalistic. For example, in many states, if you -- let's say there's a pregnant woman. She's driving down the road. Let's say she's four months pregnant. She's hit by a drunk driver, and both of them die, the mother and the baby. Then that criminal that hit them is actually charged with both murders, doesn't matter how old that baby is. OK?So there are -- there are legal cases to be made, when you want to punish somebody for a DUI that kills two people.GUILFOYLE: Two lives.PERINO: So -- and that would, I think, say in law, there is a case to be made that that is a life.WILLIAMS: What about...GUILFOYLE: You could say that's legal precedent.WILLIAMS: Trump asked, is abortion murder, and he said, ""I don't think so."" So I mean, I'm thinking to myself, he's doubled down in a very odd way for someone who is running for the Republican nomination.So should Hillary Clinton correct herself on this?WILLIAMS: From whose perspective? From the left or the right?PERINO: The right.WILLIAMS: Obviously, people like Dana would have her say that, you know what, I think a fetus is a person.KILMEADE: I think she'd rather talk about e-mails.PERINO: I think it's very hard for a grandmother -- I think it's very hard for a grandmother of one and soon to be another, for her to say that is an embryo or a fetus. I don't...GUILFOYLE: And good for her. It should be hard to say. It should be hard to be in office and know what you know, see what you've seen with your own grandchild and another one on the way.WILLIAMS: The politics of America.GUILFOYLE: Honor life.WILLIAMS: About abortion, it's a wedge issue.PERINO: It's a moral issue.BOLLING: All right. We're going to leave it all there.We all known our president can't pull himself to say the words ""Islamic terrorism."" France's president had no problem saying it last week. But did the White House intentionally try to keep the public from hearing it?  The incriminating evidence, coming up.GUILFOYLE: Yes.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: President Obama's very careful when he refers to Muslim terror attacks, refraining from linking Islam to the atrocities. But leaders of other nations, like France's president, Francois Hollande. While he was in Washington last week, he did just that. However, you didn't hear him say it on a video the White House posted of his remarks.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE (through translator): We also were aware the roots of terrorism.HOLLANDE: (SPEAKING FRENCH)(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Now, this is what Hollande actually said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HOLLANDE (through translator): But we also were aware the roots of terrorism, Islamist terrorism is in Syria and in Iraq.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: You heard that right, he used the phrase ""Islamist terrorism.""The White House initially posted the video without the edits, but then took it down and uploaded it again with the interpreter's voice muted. It blames a technical error for the word omission, and posted it for a third time, this time with Hollande's full comments.Now, as you can imagine, some of my pals here think that was intentional.  What do you say, Eric?BOLLING: It was exactly the moment -- it dropped out exactly the word ""Islamist terrorism""...GUILFOYLE: Yes.BOLLING: ... was spoken and interpreted -- interpreted, but it dropped out that very second. Then they posted it without any sort of clarification that there was a pause in the translation. And then after the backlash, not until there was backlash -- if they were caught...GUILFOYLE: After they were caught.HOLLANDE: They were caught. Then they said, ""Oh, here's the full tape.  Sorry we had a technical issue."" I don't buy that.GUILFOYLE: Lying. Lying.WILLIAMS: K.G., but the transcript that they put out did have it in it.  The transcript always had it.GUILFOYLE: I mean really, Juan. Come on. Good job. Good job, Juan, good job. I'm happy for you to try and defend them.WILLIAMS: I'm just saying...GUILFOYLE: People figured it out. OK?WILLIAMS: I'm not trying to defend them. I'm simply saying their point was, look, if you read the transcript it's always been in there. I think their defense would have been, you know, this president and this White House don't use that phrase. You're in America. This is our -- they didn't say that. They don't.GUILFOYLE: There's no excuse to cover it up. OK? Because they can say that, OK, we had the transcript there, if people like who were their supporters, like you. But we really know what happened here. Let's be honest. And they don't want President Obama to look weak and indecisive and sort of fickle as it relates to terrorism, because he won't say...WILLIAMS: So you think Obama actually was in the edit room?KILMEADE: I'm going to do it first. I'm going to defer to Dana. Tell me how this works. Is it possible that this is a coincidence? How does it work when a foreign leader comes to visit and at the end of a conference -- Is there the man or woman power to edit something out and post something like that?PERINO: I think that this White House has actually done something different. I don't believe that we would post the video. I don't -- I don't know how that works, actually. They've upgraded communications in some ways there, because they had to with the new time.I guess it's conceivable that such an incredible coincidence could happen.  And I can imagine, the press secretary's office, you get the first call, and you find out -- you have to call somebody, did we just edit Hollande's statement? Like, who does this? So it's not the press office that would have done it, in my opinion. If it would have been somewhere, somebody else. It does look a little suspicious, but it's just that word, and it's -- there's no other technical glitches throughout.WILLIAMS: Yes, I don't see how you get away. The thing is, you have just played into the hands of everyone who said, you know, ""This president refuses to say Islamic terrorism exists in the world."" I know he has a reason for it, which is he doesn't want to alienate our Muslim allies around the White House. He doesn't want to -- he doesn't want to convey the impression that the United States is involved in a Western world against Islam.GUILFOYLE: You edit world leaders that have the courage to tell the truth?KILMEADE: But if he blamed global -- if he blamed global warming for the problem with terror, that would have been edited back to its original Latin.WILLIAMS: It would have been put in?KILMEADE: Absolutely. And emphasize. What about take it down. (ph)WILLIAMS: What about if Cruz had said we should patrol Muslim neighborhoods? You know, what if Trump had said ban all Muslims from coming in the country? They would have put that up in large numbers.KILMEADE: Absolutely. The Donald Trump question...BOLLING: What does a liberal think happened?WILLIAMS: I don't know what happened.GUILFOYLE: He thinks it's suspicious.WILLIAMS: Yes, of course it's -- I'm not blind. I think it's very suspicious. I think it's a legitimate topic. I think they played into the hands of everybody who wants to be reminded. You know, I'm so mad that Obama won't say, ""Islamic terrorism.""PERINO: You never ever edit a transcript or a video of a public meeting, ever.GUILFOYLE: Epic fail. Epic fail.PERINO: It happened one time with Tony Snow. It's actually a funny story.  Tony Snow meant to say ""thank you"" to several people in the office one day.  And this is at a press briefing, and he forgets one guy that's on our team.  OK? And he's mortified, because he realizes it afterwards.And he, unbeknownst to me, calls the transcription people and says, ""Hey, could you add his name back into the transcript?"" Comes out a couple hours later. Sure enough, a reporter says, ""Wait. He didn't mention so and so, because that guy was mad."" So -- and it became this whole big issue. And the question was, does the White House edit transcripts? And so the rule is, don't ever do it.WILLIAMS: Yes, leave it alone.OK. Ahead, there were dueling music awards shows on TV last night. Which one were you watching? The highlights from the ACM and the IHeartRadio Awards next on ""The Five.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(MUSIC: DIERKS BENTLEY, ""SOMEWHERE ON A BEACH"")KILMEADE: That is Dana's theme. That is her motto. Drink all day, party all night.Dierks Bentley performing at the Academy of Country Music Awards in Las Vegas. It was a bonanza also for music lovers last night, because they also had the IHeartRadio Awards. They were from Los Angeles. We're going to get to those highlights in just a moment.But first, let's talk country. Blake Shelton co-hosted the awards at the last four ACM's with Luke Bryant. Well, this year, Bentley got the gig.  Shelton found a way, though, to steal his thunder early on.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LUKE BRYAN, COUNTRY MUSIC STAR: I'm going to bring you out as my new co- host, here we go.  My new co-host, Dierks Bentley!BLAKE SHELTER, COUNTRY MUSIC STAR: Good luck tonight, boys. He's all yours.BRYAN: You're done now.Bluke is over.DIERKS BENTLEY, COUNTRY MUSIC STAR: Bluke is over.BRYAN: From now on it's Lierks. Luke and Dierks. Lierks.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Lierks.KILMEADE: That was only kidding. That was really cool, though, right?  Let me tell you, I felt as though Luke Bryan was legitimately surprised.PERINO: By the Blake Shelton thing? I think so, too.I like the show. One of the things that's great about the ACMs is that there's a lot of music. They keep the acceptance speeches really short.  There's no politics. It's just a good show.KILMEADE: I think this is the most -- it's so hard to do these shows and be natural, Eric. These guys are -- you feel like you get to know these guys.PERINO: But they're friends.KILMEADE: I feel like they know the audience; they know the viewers. They know each other.BOLLING: Was there a sub-theme going on with that, too? Didn't Shelton's ex-wife start hanging out with...?KILMEADE: Miranda -- yes, Miranda Lambert.BOLLING: I don't know the story.KILMEADE: Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton.PERINO: They've all been -- I think they've all been friends for a long time.BOLLING: OK. Because they seem to get along well.I'm going to be honest with you. I was watching ""Billions""...PERINO: I love it.BOLLING: ""The Walking Dead"" mid-season finale.KILMEADE: You're going to be no help to me.BOLLING: Not much.KILMEADE: All right, thanks.GUILFOYLE: I can discuss the Trump town hall.KILMEADE: Here we go. This is the -- this is the story. Chris Stapleton, at 37 years old, has been a five-month wonder. This guy walked away with four awards for every blue-collar person who put in the time to write music but never had the fame? You could be happy for Chris Stapleton. Did you get that sense last night?PERINO: You want me to answer for you, Juan?WILLIAMS: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Look at Juan.KILMEADE: OK. I got it. I think it's great. All right. Let's go to the IHeart Awards. That's where we really...GUILFOYLE: Juan looks confused. Again.KILMEADE: OK, here's what IHeart Awards. Congratulations, Chris Stapleton, Chris. I appreciate what you did. Congratulations on the beard. You could be on ""Duck Dynasty."" Now, the IHeartRadio Awards, Taylor Swift, what a stunner. Does she have any room left on her mantel for awards?PERINO: She's America's sweetheart. She wins everything. She's a winner.KILMEADE: And evidently, her boyfriend, who's a dancer. I never would have thought they'd...BOLLING: No, he's a D.J. He's a D.J.GUILFOYLE: This is the worst segment ever.KILMEADE: No, it says ""dancer."" But he won something, too. Right. But his real name is Adam.GUILFOYLE: No, this is Brian into it. He's just a little confused.KILMEADE: I am into it. Justin Bieber won best male artist.BOLLING: New hair. Best new hair.KILMEADE: Right. The worst new hair.BOLLING: I don't think it's been well-accepted.GUILFOYLE: This isn't going well.KILMEADE: This is like me in a singles bar. No one's making eye contact.  Nobody's -- nobody's even looking up -- usually, people are, like, on the edge of their seats to talk.GUILFOYLE: Next thing you know, Miley Cyrus is going to have that hairdo.BOLLING: We talked about that this week, whether white young boys, whether he should be wearing dreads or not or whether it's cultural appropriation.  So Justin Bieber is being accused of cultural appropriation. He's got dreads.WILLIAMS: I think that's the silliest thing. I just -- there's so many -- so much more that you want to talk about. Clearly -- clearly, I think when we talk, this yesterday. If you talk about cultural appropriation, it's the fact that hip-hop is so popular with young white guys.BOLLING: Right.WILLIAM: But anyway, you know what? I am so (UNINTELLIGIBLE) on this topic, I must tell you. So I was amazed to see that I did know one song.  It says here that the song of the year at the IHeart Awards was ""Hello.""  And I know that song.My grandchildren sing that song.KILMEADE: I actually, in telepathy -- I actually thought I was going to end up doing the segment. I watched the awards. Despite how the...GUILFOYLE: We've got to go.KILMEADE: Thanks so much. Yes. Juan started talking. ""One More Thing"" is next.WILLIAMS: I know it was me.KILMEADE: It was you.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: It's time now for ""One More Thing.""Hi. OK, Eric. Look at my Chihuahua story, it's so cute. But I'm not first.BOLLING: Very quickly, check it out. Here's a full screen tonight. Big primetime lineup. All three of the GOP candidates and Bill O'Reilly's back in the saddle again. So make sure you keep it right here all night, on Fox News.OK, my ""One More Thing."" Police are being gunned down at a rate not seen since the 1990s. More cops have been killed by guns this year than maybe if we go back 20, 25 years. That's why this is so important. Check out these two kids, Aidan and Nathan, in Lee's Summit, Missouri, with a lemonade stand to benefit cops. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They protect us. Every single one of us. And if we didn't have them, our world would be apocalyptic.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The police have done so much for us, and they have nothing in return. They just do it, because that's their job. And they deserve a treat.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: Aww.BOLLING: We should all have Aidan and Nathan's point of view on cops.GUILFOYLE: And great parents, I'm sure, raising them in the right way, to appreciate that level of public service and devotion.All right. What do you got, Juan?WILLIAMS: Forty-eight years ago, today, April 4, 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. shot and killed in Memphis. James Earl Ray was sentenced for the assassination, 99 years in jail. He died in 1998.Now, when the sad anniversary comes up, I always recall that the day before he was killed, Dr. King gave a prophetic speech on race, in which he said difficult days were ahead in American race relations, but he said God had taken him to the mountain top, and he'd seen the promised land. And he went on to say -- ""and I've looked over and I've seen, even though I may not get there with you, but I want you to know that tonight we as a people, we as Americans will get there.""GUILFOYLE: Thank you for that, Juan. Dana.PERINO: All right. Real quickly. Greg Murray has created something really fun. It's called For the Love of Peanut Butter. Basically, he gives peanut butter to all these dogs and he takes these pictures of them.  And they're trying -- it's like all these portraits. He's done over 50 mutts. You can check it out at For the Love of Peanut Butter. That's Greg Murray. It's really cute and fun. You can do it with your own dog at home.BOLLING: So cool.GUILFOYLE: Aww. I should have done that as ""Kimberly's Food Court"" and eating peanut butter.Fine, whatever. It's my turn.Chihuahua, let's roll this. This is the cutest thing you've ever seen in your life. So this little Chihuahua is in animal custody after eating peanut butter and leading police on a chase -- I'm kidding -- across the Oakland/San Francisco Bay Bridge. So the CHIP there said, he led us on quite a chase. Look at him. Look at him go. And he's in custody now.KILMEADE: That's awesome, but I have the most important ""One More Thing.""  Tomorrow's going to be the big day, but it's available today. ""We, The People"" is out. It's Juan Williams' brand-new book. It's extremely important. I think you're going to be on ""Fox & Friends"" tomorrow...WILLIAMS: I am, I am.KILMEADE: ... talking about it. And it's bringing new life to the most important people in America in this generation, from Thurgood Marshall to what he did all the way to -- even with Ronald Reagan.WILLIAMS: Oh, yes. You have a new Mount Rushmore, with Billy Graham and Ronald Reagan, Eleanor Roosevelt...GUILFOYLE: Bye, Juan. Bye.KILMEADE: This is not only a good book. It's an important book.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MARIA BARTIROMO, HOST: Good morning.It could be the event that determines our next president. Hi, everyone.  I'm Maria Bartiromo. Thanks for joining us. This is ""Sunday Morning Futures.""A record breaking audience expected for tomorrow night's first debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. I'll speak with RNC Chairman Reince Priebus coming up, and the Republican candidate's son, Eric Trump, coming up about what they expect during the big square off Monday night.I'll also ask the RNC chair about the surprising about-face from Texas Senator Ted Cruz, now endorsing Donald Trump. How big of a deal is that?  Is it because Mr. Priebus threatened to withhold RNC support from future presidential candidates who do not get in line behind the current nominee?And peaceful protests overnight after Charlotte police released their video of the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. I'll talk with two police chiefs who have recently dealt with major crises in the cities. What needs to be done as we look at those stories on ""Sunday Morning Futures"".(MUSIC)BARTIROMO: Just one day to go before the big presidential debate, the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.  Workers inside the debate hall at Hofstra University on Long Island are busy right now setting up the stage.Mrs. Clinton reportedly putting in long hours with top aid visors, brushing up on her deep knowledge of policy, while Mr. Trump is said to be planning to rely largely on instinct, he said he will relax and be himself. He's apparently watching video of Mrs. Clinton's best and worst debate moments, looking for any vulnerability.So what can we expect tomorrow night?We want to bring in Reince Priebus right now. He is the chairman of the Republican National Committee.Reince, it's great to see you.REINCE PRIEBUS, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us, Mr. Chairman.Let's begin right there -- what are you expecting in terms of what we're going to hear from these two candidates tomorrow night?PRIEBUS: Well, I think the expectations on Hillary are very, very high. I mean, she's been doing this for 30 years. I think people expect her to know every little detail and -- you know, she has to perform, I think, in a way that is of the highest of expectations.I think in the case of Donald Trump, look, he's the outsider, he's a person who's never run before, let alone be a presidential debate, but he's going to be ready and I think one of the things that Donald Trump has going for him, he has very good instincts. We've seen that.Look, we went through an incredible year in our primary.BARTIROMO: Right.PRIEBUS: Unlike anything anyone's been through. Lots of drama, and 12 debates, and at every one of the debates, as everyone in the pundits said, this is the day Donald Trump isn't going to be -- and every time he won that debate based on the polling that was done afterwards. So he's got good instincts. I think he's, obviously, a good counterpuncher. I think he speaks a language that people out there can understand and so, I think he's going to have a good night.BARTIROMO: Some people feel like I want change, I want to shake up what has been in place for 30 years, but it's a risk --PRIEBUS: Right.BARTIROMO: -- voting for someone who I know has never been in politics, who I know speaks his mind. Do you want to go with the security of, well, this has been in place even though there's corruption and we're questioning what will take place in the next four to eight years, or do you want to bet on Trump and take that risk?PRIEBUS: Well, any time you have a changed candidate, you said it exactly right, it's always change versus risk. In other words, how much risk am I going to take in order to get the change? And the electorate is like a river that flows, and if your candidate's flowing with the river, it's a lot easier to win and Donald Trump's flowing with the river. People want to change. The other side wanted to change, too, that's why Sanders almost won, but they got stuck with Hillary.BARTIROMO: Right.PRIEBUS: So, now, you have the status quo on one side, the change candidate on our side, which we're feeling good about, and the electorate that wants to move that direction, but limiting risk, you know, discipline, those are the things Donald Trump has been doing, he's been doing it very, very well. A lot of people texted me last night, thought last night's speech was the best speech he'd ever given on the trail so far, but it's the message discipline that the electorate is looking for and I think he carries that into tomorrow night. I see good things happening for us.BARTIROMO: You look at Hillary Clinton's website and it's literally A to Z. It starts with Alzheimer's. There's so much in there.You look at Donald Trump's website and it's four-point plan on the economy, you know, lower taxes, cut back regulations, tap into energy, and redo trade deals that aren't working, make America great again. It's very specific, very short.So, do you want to see all of that specifics that Hillary is bringing, or do you want to see a broad vision for the country that people say, OK, you know what, this person could be my president?PRIEBUS: Donald Trump's plan is also very smart, because going to the heart of the issues that the American people are concerned about, jobs, foreign policy, security, sovereignty. These are the things that everyone is talking about.The problem with Hillary Clinton is, you know, she's got, as you pointed out, she has all of these ideas, all these incredible things she's going to do in foreign policy and abroad, one of the things that Donald Trump has said so often, which is very true, look, I appreciate Hillary, you have all of these ideas and things you want to do in regard to foreign policy, but of all the people out there in the world that had the opportunity to make these things, it was you.BARTIROMO: Right.PRIEBUS: No one out there watching us right now, Maria, had the opportunity she had. Did she do it? No, she failed and it was a disaster.  So, while it's great now, what happened when you had the chance?BARTIROMO: Each side trying to get in the other's head. Obviously, Hillary's camp invites Mark Cuban to sit in the front row facing Donald Trump right there. Are there rules about what we're going to see on screen from the debate commission?PRIEBUS: Well, usually when these debates are put on, there are some conversations about what's going to be in the screen shot and what's not.  I would hope and expect that the Presidential Debate Commission, the Commission on Presidential Debates would look at what the screen shot is and make determinations of who should be there, who shouldn't, or the campaign should probably be involved in the process.I don't know where that's going, but that's typically something that does happen before the debate.BARTIROMO: Probably not going to be allowed to have somebody there taunting.PRIEBUS: I would hope not. I don't think we want to have a fiasco here and I don't think there will be, quite frankly. And I think -- so, people understand, the Trump campaign has not invited Gennifer Flowers to be at the debate.Obviously, this Mark Cuban play, I think, was over the top by the Hillary Clinton campaign. That wasn't just by accident. Look, you hit Donald Trump and sometimes he counterpunches. Even if it's for a laugh, but it's important that they understand that this is something that I don't think it acceptable to taunt and to do those sorts of things.BARTIROMO: At this point, you've got party unity it looks like. I mean, Ted Cruz endorsing Donald Trump is a big deal.Is that because you were very clear with people and you said, look, you're not going to get the money, you're not going to get the Republican National Committee support if you do not get behind the nominee. You did sign a pledge after all.PRIEBUS: Well, I appreciate Senator Cruz coming onboard and appreciate the fact he didn't just say, ""I'm supporting Donald Trump."" He actually laid out a really smart, intelligent, you know, reason for, you know, six reasons why he was supporting Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, mainly for one thing for all the Republicans out there and independents, the Supreme Court.We're not just talking about a four-year presidency. We're talking about 40 years of laws that can go by the wayside if we don't get control of the Supreme Court. We have Scalia's appointment, but potentially two or three others that might pop up.BARTIROMO: That's right.PRIEBUS: It wasn't a matter of threats at all. I'm not into the making threats business, but I do think it's important for candidates to compete in a process and we have in some cases one, two, or three different pledges with particular candidates, some signed some, some signed one, two, three, some signed them all.I just think if you say you're going to want to run under the Republican flag and you say you're going to support the Republican nominee, I think you should just honor that commitment. Otherwise don't run. I mean, you don't have to run for president. We don't need 16 people running.If you want to be one of the 16, live up to your word, and he did. And for that, I'm very, very appreciative of what Ted Cruz did. Plus, I would also commend their campaign, because they've been very helpful to our party in helping us with data. You know, we have data exchange agreements and Cruz's campaign has been very, very good about that. In fact, so has Jeb Bush's campaign, actually, they've been very good with exchanging data with the Republican Party.BARTIROMO: I like the fact Ted Cruz was a man of his word. Afterwards, he said, by the way, I don't want Hillary Clinton as a president.We'll see what conservatives and Republicans have to say to those who did not get onboard if Hillary Clinton becomes president. They are going to be mad at those people.PRIEBUS: There's still time, I hope they'll come onboard.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Reince, it's great to see you.PRIEBUS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: An exciting night tomorrow night.PRIEBUS: It probably will be.BARTIROMO: Reince Priebus joining us there.And be sure to tune into my morning show on the Fox Business Network.  We've got a great couple of days coming up. From the point inside and analysis of tomorrow's historic presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, we kick off at 6:00 a.m. Eastern tomorrow morning on the Fox Business Network's ""Mornings with Maria.""Donald Trump gears up for a pivotal moment in the campaign as the countdown rolls on to tomorrow night's primetime debate. Will he be ready for anything Hillary Clinton throws his way? I'm talking with Eric Trump coming up, his son, about that and a lot more.Follow me on Twitter. Let us know what you want to hear from Chairman Michael McCaul, he's coming up, as well, @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures.Stay with us as we look ahead this morning on ""Sunday Morning Futures"".(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.It's now been just over a week since explosions rocked New York City and New Jersey, but investigators have been unable to question the suspect yet, Ahmad Khan Rahami. It's still being said he's unconscious at a hospital in New Jersey as new questions arise about his travels abroad and how he became radicalized. Now, some of those questions may be answered because we're learning that his wife has returned to the United States from the United Arab Emirates and she is now cooperating with law enforcement.Republican Congressman Michael McCaul is with us from Texas. He's the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.Congressman, it's good to see you again. Thanks so much for joining us.REP. MIKE MCCAUL, R-TEXAS, HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Thanks, Maria. Thank you for having me.BARTIROMO: What can you tell us about the wife of Rahami at this point and what we're learning in terms of this motivations?MCCAUL: Well, we know he married her in Pakistan, she went to UAE. She came back into the United States. My understanding from law enforcement officials is that she is cooperating with them, so it's a very positive sign.We are looking into these travels overseas. He had multiple trips to Pakistan, Afghanistan, and turkey. In one instance in Quetta outside of -- in Pakistan, which is a Taliban stronghold, had attended a mosque for several months and it's a very radicalized mosque. So, we want to know what he was doing over there. Most of the people around him when he came back said he changed after that event and after that trip to Pakistan.BARTIROMO: And we know that those trips can be, obviously, a radicalization and maybe that's why he changed. What do we need to do in the homeland, Congressman, in terms of ensuring that these folks don't keep going back, coming back, and having these quiet cells that who knows what danger they can create?MCCAUL: Well, I think it goes to the vetting process. We know he had a secondary screening by CVP within the Department of Homeland Security.  That information was shared with the FBI. You know, the FBI did open an investigation into Mr. Rahami.And I think one of the questions that I have is why when the father was interviewed and said his son was a terrorist, why wasn't the subject of the investigation, Mr. Rahami, interviewed? Perhaps that would have revealed more information that possibly could have led us to disrupt this terrorist plot.BARTIROMO: Right, especially since the father said I think my son is a terrorist. I mean, you know, it's incredible that that wasn't taken more seriously.Let me switch gears to what has happened this weekend, and, obviously, there was a Washington mall shooter. He's been caught. The suspect was 20 years old. Turkish, Muslim, Arcan Cetin. He was arrested for murder of the five people that he killed in the mall in Washington state. What can you tell us about him, is this related to Islamic terrorism?MCCAUL: I think there was a good chance it could be. I know, right now law enforcement, FBI is playing it safe, saying there's no links to terrorism and that's true at least from the evidence so far. I wouldn't be surprised if we find out more details about this individual, as well as we did Mr. Rahami.Remember, I held up this journal of Mr. Rahami's, the bloodstained journal with the bullet hole where he talks about these ISIS spokesmen, Mr. Sheikh Adnani basically saying do not come to Syria anymore, attack at home, attack where you are. In fact, he says attack the unbeliever in their backyard.BARTIROMO: Incredible.MCCAUL: And so, Maria, what I'm worried about is we're going to see more and more of these sort of small scale attacks, but very lethal happening more and more in the United States.BARTIROMO: Yes.Congressman, real quick, let me switch gears. Obviously, Ted Cruz is endorsing Donald Trump. You were critical of those who were not getting behind the nominee at this point because they signed a pledge, do you feel better about the fact that now Ted Cruz is supporting Donald Trump? He's come around?MCCAUL: Well, you know, I am. I've said all along that all Republicans should not stand on the sidelines, rather unify as a party behind the nominee, otherwise, I believe they are being complicit with Hillary Clinton becoming the next president of the United States.I stood up very strongly at our convention in Cleveland, very strong support of the nominee, because I think that's the right thing to do and I believe it's the right thing to do for the country if you look at the differences between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump, particularly on national security issues where I think she's very vulnerable, she created and destabilized the Middle East and Northern Africa, which has led to the formation not only of ISIS, but all these terror groups we're seeing spring up in that area that can't provide external operations into the homeland.BARTIROMO: You have to believe that Republicans are going to be upset with those people that did not follow through on their word and back up the Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of what's going to be an incredible night tomorrow night.Congressman, we'll see you soon. We so appreciate your time this morning.  Thank you so much.MCCAUL: Thanks. Maria.BARTIROMO: Congressman Michael McCaul joining us.Nearly a third of the country expected to watch the presidential debate tomorrow night. What does Eric Trump want to see from his father? Eric Trump will join me next as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: More than 100 million people are expected to watch the debate, the first presidential debate, Monday night.Eric Trump is the executive vice president of development and acquisitions for the Trump Organization and, of course, Donald Trump's son.Eric, great to see you.ERIC TRUMP, SON OF DONALD TRUMP: Great to be here, Maria.BARTIROMO: What do you feel when you hear those numbers? A hundred million Americans tuned in to the debate tomorrow night.TRUMP: It's amazing. It's special, and I think it's actually a testament in many ways to my father and what he's created. I mean, he's not a typical politician. He's not the scripted politician.He started an incredible movement in this country. He's talking to working class Americans who have totally been left behind by career politicians and that's exactly what Hillary is.BARTIROMO: And it's a very simple, straight forward message -- we need to control the borders so we know who's coming in and out, so we can make sure the country is safe. We need to create jobs.That message he has been really hammering home these last couple of weeks, is that how he's preparing? What's he doing to prepare for the big debate?TRUMP: Yes, really two words, America first. You know, very, very simple.  That hasn't happened in so long.We're disrespected all over the world. President flies into China last week, they don't even bring a stair case up to Air Force One. I mean, he literally comes out of the service entrance of the plane.We need to bring back respect to this country. We need to bring back jobs to this country. We have to stop losing our manufacturing overseas. We have to decrease our national deficit.We have to take care of our educational system, which is a mess. I mean, we're ranked 30th in the world in terms of education in the United States.  We need to start putting America first again, and that's his message and it's very, very simple.BARTIROMO: So what will be success at this debate from your standpoint?  What do you want to feel when you're walking out of the debate to feel, OK, I think my team won?TRUMP: Yes, being himself. I mean, my father being himself.You look at Hillary -- I mean, Hillary has been a politician longer than I've been alive. It's kind of hard to believe, she's been a politician, what, 36 years. She just beats me out by a little bit. I mean, that's all she's done her entire life.My father comes in. He's built an amazing organization. He's built an incredible company. He's employed tens and tens of thousands of people.  He's a brilliant guy.He doesn't need the job. I mean, the reason he's in is to work out this message the politicians have created over the last 30 years. And you see all the problems. You see the things that are happening in this country right now that are unthinkable. Whether it'd be bombs going off in downtown New York and New Jersey and people getting stabbed in malls in Minnesota, ISIS and how they are on the rise, you see the Middle East, which is complete hornet's nest, it's a total mess -- Iraq, Syria, Libya, all these countries.We've spent trillions of dollars and are worse off because of it. We've lost thousands and thousands of lives.My father has to be the guy he is, which is authentic and true. He's an amazing person and he wants -- he's doing this for the right reason and that's what you're going to see on Monday.BARTIROMO: We saw him react to the racial unrest that we saw and the protesting that we saw this past week, and he was very measured. Tell us what went into that. Did you talk to him after what took place in North Carolina and in Tulsa? When he saw the Tulsa video, he was -- he knew what it looked like.TRUMP: That's because what's worse than this? I mean, we need unity back in this country.BARTIROMO: Can he bring everybody together?TRUMP: I think so. I mean, right now you have a divide that's unbelievable. You have our law enforcement, which are amazing people. You also have a community that feels left behind and, quite frankly, that community in so many regards has been left behind. I mean, you look at so many inner cities in this country, you have 60 percent unemployment in African-American youth throughout the United States -- I mean, 60 percent.BARTIROMO: He's talking about it through this four-step plan to, number one, lower taxes. Number two, roll back regulations. Number three, tap into industry. And number four, redo trade deals that are not advantageous to America.TRUMP: Well, think of that what establishes, right? I mean, think about what jobs, bringing jobs to America accomplishes, putting people to work, really making them aspire to do something fantastic, giving them hope and opportunity. I mean, that's an amazingly powerful tool.Think about if we get rid of all the waste and inefficiency in government, right? The $20 trillion. We just gave $150 billion to Iran, a country that hates us. Think if we could use that and invest in our schools and our inner cities and inner city communities and everything else. I mean, think of the opportunities that would create.BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Hillary's camp invited Mark Cuban to the debate and Mark Cuban was tweeting last week saying, look, I have a front row seat.  Maybe he's trying to get into your father's head. He came on the Fox Business Network and he basically said, ""I have my Trump hedge in, if Trump wins the election, the stock market is going to tank.""Is he going to get in your father's head by sitting there front and center watching your father?TRUMP: I think Mark Cuban's confused, quite frankly. Couple months ago saying my father was the greatest thing happening to politics. We were using his stadiums and he's over here and he's back. Listen, I don't know what to make of him.And, you know, who knows? It's not going to affect my father at all. In fact, my father is going to have a lot of working class Americans at the debate, and those are who have been left behind by this country, (INAUDIBLE) invite the politicians.BARTIROMO: Well, I have to believe you each got the same amount of seats in the front row, right? So, you are going to have people in the front row.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: I know it is all about the smart fundamental things, but there is something.TRUMP: We'll have people in the front row, I'll be one of them, so will Ivanka and so will Don. And, you know, I didn't miss a single debate, I'm so proud to be there by my father's side. And, believe me, we'll be at every one of these and will be cheering him on as a family and doing great.BARTIROMO: What's most important, do you think, in terms of the swing states? I mean, you look at Colorado, you look at Ohio, you look at even Pennsylvania getting real tight. Does any one of these strike you as more important than the other, the fact that he's been able to turn some of these swing states?TRUMP: It's incredible. I spent -- I spent the last three days in Pennsylvania, all over the state, everywhere from Pittsburgh on the west to, you know, Philly yesterday with my father and the amount of love is incredible.You couldn't drive 100 yards without seeing another huge Trump sign in the front yard. As we were leaving last night, we drove past a fire department. Every single engine was outside the fire department, their horns blaring, their sirens going, and the whole fire department was clapping. I mean, this right outside Philadelphia. I mean, the love is tremendous.Then you see states like Colorado, when was the last time Colorado went Republican, right? And we're winning, so many polls have us either tied or ahead in a state that's never been won by a Republican. I mean, his message is resonating.You know, look at New Mexico, look at Nevada. So many of these states, I mean he's really --BARTIROMO: So, they are all important.TRUMP: He's really rewritten the electoral map and it's amazing.BARTIROMO: What about the black vote? I saw him at that church in Detroit, where the pastor interrupted him, look, Mr. Trump, we didn't invite you here to do a political speech. He handled that very well.  What's he doing? Does he need to do more to get the African-American community in his corner?TRUMP: I think one of the great takeaways, honestly, the great takeaways of this campaign and of the Republican Party this election cycle is what he's been doing with the African-American communities. He's been in so many of the African-American communities. He's been talking to those communities.Those communities have been so left behind by our government. I mentioned 60 percent African-American youth that are unemployed in these communities.  You look at, you know, some of the poverty rates in the communities, you look at what's happened to food stamps, right, during the Obama administration -- they've gone up tremendously.These communities have been left behind and, quite frankly, Democrats have always taken their vote totally for granted. And it's so nice to see him going in and saying, listen, I'm going to bring back jobs, I'm going to bring you opportunity. I'm going to come back and I'm going to fix your educational system.I'm going to give their children school choice. I'm going to fix the problem and you'll not be ignored because you are an important part of society that's been totally left behind.BARTIROMO: I like the idea he sends notes to his followers and supporters saying what do you want me to do at the debate, should I call her crooked Hillary, is he listening to what he's hearing from his supporters, is he going to call her crooked Hillary on the debate stage?TRUMP: Yes, he's absolutely listening, he does that very well. You know, so many of these, you can't script these things. You kind of have to go out there and feel the moment.I think that's the problem with politicians. They try and script each minute as well. In minute one, I'm going to do this. In minute two, I don't know what she's going to do, I don't know what she's going to say about him.BARTIROMO: Is it more important when he's on the debate stage to talk about where his vision is for the country or will it be more important to remind folks of things like you just said, about his opponent? Talk about where Hillary Clinton's failures were?TRUMP: I think it's both.BARTIROMO: Both.TRUMP: And I think it's a message of America first. We have to start winning again. I mean, it's the winning message -- jobs, jobs, jobs, it's our economy. It's stop the waste, stop the nonsense, stop the abuse, stop other countries from ripping us off.Take care of the people who are suffering in our own country before you take care of those outside of our borders. I mean, America has to come first for our politicians and that's not how it's been run. I think also you have to point to a pretty terrible track record that has created so many of the problems we see every day in our everyday lives.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there, we'll be watching Monday night.TRUMP: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: The debate stage.Eric, thank you.TRUMP: Great being with you.BARTIROMO: Eric Trump joining us there. Follow me on Twitter, let me know what you would like to hear @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures.Stay with us as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures"".(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Bowing to intense public pressure, police in Charlotte, North Carolina, releasing the police body and dash cam footage of Tuesday's fatal shooting of Keith Scott. I must warn you, these videos are graphic. So, step away if you don't want to look at this. The video showing officers surrounding Scott, who has his hands at his side before shots are fired and he falls to the ground.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(GUNFIRE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Handcuff, handcuff, handcuff.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Police also releasing descriptions and pictures from the scene showing a handgun, ankle holster, and marijuana blunt. Scott's wife insisting he did not have a gun, he had a book in his hand. It wasn't a gun.Let's bring in two veterans of law enforcement right now, Jarrod Burguan, chief of police for San Bernardino, California, and John Mina, police chief for Orlando, Florida.Gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us this morning. We appreciate it.Chief Burguan, let me pick this up with you, your reaction to what has taken place and I guess characterize for us right now how you see thing.CHIEF JARROD BURGUAN, SAN BERNARDINO POLICE DEPT.: You know, I think it's a time in law enforcement, we are dealing with this new dynamic of everything that we do is potentially captured on video and that, of course, is kind of a scary time for cops.We say a lot that there's not a lot that's very pretty about the work that we do and it's not pretty to have to go into communities and sometimes enforce the law and sometimes do the things that we ask very young men and women in some cases to do. And contrast that to previous generations, suddenly they are doing everything live on TV and being scrutinized for their action. Scary place to be.BARTIROMO: So, Chief Mina, is that dictating behavior in some regard, the fact we all have our cameras and we're watching? Is that changing behaviors in any way? How would you characterize the status of police in America today?CHIEF JOHN MINA, ORLANDO POLICE DEPT: I do think it's changing behaviors.  And remember, 40 police officers this year have been killed by gunfire and our police officers have to make split second decisions. These incidents happen in the blink of an eye.And remember the officer doesn't have the luxury of going back and looking at the videotape and scrutinizing frame by frame, should I have done this, should I have done that. The fact of the matter, especially in this case, people need to comply with the commands of police officers. Police officers all across the United States run into people with guns, either legally owned or illegally owned and those interactions are peacefully resolved because the people comply with the commands of police officers.BARTIROMO: And then there are lasting effects, as well. Chief Burguan, tell us about San Bernardino. The public watching what took place in San Bernardino and then knowing that this was someone inspired by Islamic terrorism, that also dictates how the public looks at things.BURGUAN: Yes, I think so. To our experience here in San Bernardino something that, unfortunately, is becoming somewhat commonplace across the country. Statistically still rare when you look at how large our country is and all the activity going on, but nonetheless, we see incident after incident after incident of these Islamic inspired terrorists, people that are acting out against unarmed citizens for, you know, their own ideological beliefs.It is our new reality. It is something that we have to deal with. From a law enforcement standpoint, what makes it a little frightening is that as Director Comey said, we're not just looking for a needle in a hay stack, we're looking for the needle within the needle and that's a very tough place to be.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean -- and then there's the situation in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Chief Mina. You know, when you look at what transpired there and the officer being served with manslaughter charges. Are there things that we need to be doing in terms of training for police?MINA: Well, certainly, training is a factor, but remember, you know, I hate to comment on that case because that officer didn't have the luxury of looking back at the videotape, but training is very important for our officers, and I think that something that many police departments have realized for years and years and years and they are doing in training. But remember, these incidents happened in a split second.BARTIROMO: So, what do you want to hear from the leadership of the country, both of you? I mean, you know, there has been a lot of conversation this year that the president and the administration does not give enough support to police forces around the country. Is that what you're feeling, and does that also play into this, that they are afraid to carry out their jobs?MINA: Well, I think the message should be that our officers have an extremely difficult job, give them the benefit of the doubt, you know, we're human just like everyone else, we're going to make mistakes, and it's just important to know those mistakes will be thoroughly investigated and as you've seen in a case like Tulsa and other cases around the country, officers are going to be held accountable for their actions, although having some very, very difficult situations every day.BARTIROMO: Final word, Chief Burguan?BURGUAN: You know, I think that our police officers would like to see some more support. Policing is changing dramatically. Policing today is far different than what it was when I started my career 24 years ago and certainly different from, you know, the old-timers when I started who started 40 years ago.The great thing about this profession is that it continues to evolve and it will change, it will modify, and ultimately, we'll deliver service in a way that our communities are willing to accept. But at the end of the day, we have to remember that debate has to be a common sense debate and people are at the end of the day going to get the policing that they want and everybody needs to be part of that discussion.BARTIROMO: And it's a very difficult job. We know that you and your teams are putting yourselves out there every day and we thank you for that.  Chief Burguan, Chief Mina, thank you for joining us this morning.MINA: Thanks for having us.BURGUAN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We appreciate it.Let's get a look at what's coming up, top of the hour, ""Media Buzz"", check in with Howie Kurtz. He's at Hofstra University, gearing up, ready for tomorrow's big debate.Howie, how does it look? Tell us.HOWARD KURTZ, HOST, ""MEDIABUZZ"": It's a massive media center here. This is going to be the super bowl of the political campaign, as you know, Maria, got an all-star lineup.We're going to look at the media expectations game, what Trump and Clinton need to do, you've heard hours and hours how that will affect the debate, also the role of the moderators, how much fact checking can do and should they do, how much heat they're going to take in this hyperpartisan atmosphere. Bill Hemmer, Martha McCallum, and a lot of other FOX favorites on ""Media Buzz"" coming up.BARTIROMO: All right. We will be there top of the hour. Thank you so much.The debate is what everybody is talking about, it's getting closer and closer. Tomorrow night, 100 million people watching.We're going to talk with our panel next, what should we expect from Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The panel is on deck, back in a moment on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.More now on our top story just one day to go before the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. A new poll shows that the nominees are in a virtual dead heat in the race for the White House. What can we expect tomorrow night and will the debate move the needle on this dead heat situation?Our panel now, Ed Rollins is a former campaign manager for the Reagan/Bush ticket. In 1984, he is the strategist for a Trump super PAC. Stephen Sigmund is senior vice president of the Global Strategy Group and a Democratic strategist. And Mary Kissel is a member of ""The Wall Street Journal"" editorial board.Good to see you, everybody. Thank you for joining us.What are you expecting tomorrow night?ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Dead even race. Traditionally, debates don't move numbers, they re-enforce your own side. In this case, with potentially 100 million people, there's eight percent undecided, you could move four or five, six million people in this debate and that's enough to win this thing.BARTIROMO: So, we know the expectations, Steve.STEVE: Yes.BARTIROMO: So, do they have to break away from those expectations to move the needle in that regard?STEPHEN SIGMUND, SR. VP GLOBAL STRATEGY GROUP: Look, I think the expectations game is tough for her. I think over the course -- remember, there's going to be three debates. So, over the course of three debates, I think she will prove to be more ready and prepared to be president.But in the first debate she has to be presidential, she has to be honest and trustworthy, she has to know her facts, but not too much. She has to take him on, but not too much. Oh, and she has to smile more.And all he has to do is not be crazy and be adequately prepared. So that's a tough assignment in the first debate and I think it can, you know, if he crosses that very low bar, it can move votes, but that's a bar he's had trouble with in the past.BARTIROMO: There's also an issue about coughing, perhaps her pneumonia, do you think that comes up?SIGMUND: No, I doubt it. Look, I think he's taken some unfair shots at the notion of health. This guy has had his version of health is two notes that are, like Epstein's mom from ""Welcome Back Kotter"". So, I think if that becomes a debate, it's a debate they'll battle to the top.BARTIROMO: No, I guess, what I was saying, Mary, is she not well, because she has pneumonia, but maybe that's all face. Maybe she's been resting and she's ready to go.MARY KISSEL, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: There are a lot of unknowns for this debate. Health is one of them. Debate preparation, we're hearing that Trump isn't preparing for this debate. That's sort of a thing.We don't know the role that the moderator is going to play in this debate.  If Lester Holt is going to come across as more of a Candy Crowley interfering in the debate or Jim Lehrer that just lets the candidates duke it out themselves. We just don't know.But I think Ed is right. This is a very, very important debate, particularly for Trump, because it's the first time that many Americans will see him for an extended period of time. Not just in a 30-second attack ad and not characterizations of him in the print press. So it's going to be fun to watch.BARTIROMO: So, it's 90 minutes. You're right, this is the first time that long of a period where we're going to actually have to hear them both talk about their vision for the country.ROLLINS: He has to project strength. You have to look at him at the end of this end, and she may win the policy wonk award at the end of the night, no one cares. But if he projects strength and he basically says, listen, I've spent my entire life being a decision maker, the president's job is to make four or five big decisions every single day. The job of the president is to able to sit down across the table from Putin and others and be tough and negotiate. I can do those things, she can't.She had a commercial when she ran against President Obama about the 3:00 a.m. phone call, who do you want to answer the phone call before (INAUDIBLE)? She's got that phone call. She got in Benghazi and she didn't answer it and didn't do well. That's what I would say. I'm the decision maker, she's not. I'm a leader, she's not.SIGMUND: But he does -- respectfully, I think he does have more of a challenge than just that. This is a guy who two t-thirds of the country think he's unqualified for the job he's going to get and only living president thinks he's unqualified for that. So, he's going -- he actually does have to demonstrate some preparedness and having done his homework.BARTIROMO: Right.KISSEL: I agree with that, but in recent polls, Donald Trump is seen as more trustworthy than Hillary Clinton is, and you also have to remember that Trump could be the only candidate that can fight Hillary at her level.  Look at what they did when the Clinton campaign said, well, Mark Cuban is going to sit in the front row. What's Trump do? Rolls out the bimbo eruptions in Gennifer Flowers, he fights at their level. He's very unpredictable.I think the biggest danger for Trump is controlling the inner Trump, which is, you know, staying calm and staying on message, he's a candidate of change and he's got and staying on message. He's a candidate of change and he's got a big advantage because of that.ROLLINS: This is how he plays golf. He always stays very close to the end. People tell me he's a scratch golfer. He always to stays right there and he wins it in the end. He's a very competitive man.And I think the key thing here is going to project that strength and he basically -- and to your point about him being -- she has the same kind of numbers and she's been on the stage for 30 years.BARTIROMO: Right.ROLLINS: So, I think the reality is this is going to be people are going to make their minds up and reinforce the base.SIGMUND: She doesn't have the same kind of numbers on being qualified for president. You asked about trustworthiness and honesty, in fact, she has a challenge she's got to come across as warm.But I think the inner Trump, showing the inner Trump by coming up with this Gennifer Flowers thing is about as clever and charming as an 11-year-old middle schooler and about as effective with women.BARTIROMO: By the way, we're going to take a short break. By the way, I don't think any of that is going to materialize. Mark Cuban is not going to be in the front row. Gennifer Flowers is not going to be. None of it.  You heard it first. I don't think it's going to be allowed.More from the debate, more from our panel, as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures"", next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back. I'm back with the panel, Ed Rollins, Stephen Sigmund, Mary Kissel.Let's talk about the moderator for a second.  Lester Holt moderating tonight where 100 million people will be watching. What do you expect from him yourself as a journalist, Mary Kissel?KISSEL: I would hope he would ask tough questions of both candidates.  Lester Holt is getting a lot of pressure from the left not to let Donald Trump, quote-unquote ""get away with lies"". They want him to fact check Donald Trump. Of course, they are not asking for Hillary Clinton to be fact checked.Effectively, they want Lester Holt to inject himself into the debate, to become part of the debate. That's not the job of a moderator. Job of a moderator is to ask tough questions and facilitate the debate.BARTIROMO: That's what Candy Crowley did and she got it wrong.KISSEL: She did. And Mitt Romney froze and I think it's a large part of the reason why he lost that debate and lost the confidence of the American people.BARTIROMO: Yes.SIGMUND: I agree with that. I mean, I think the moderator's job is to ask tough questions but there's a job to do on fact checking both of the candidates. I think, you know, when the fact checkers do fact checking on both candidate a guy who found out 85 percent of what he says is not true is going to do very badly.BARTIROMO: So, is it up to Hillary Clinton to say oh, Donald Trump you just said this and I think --SIGMUND: Sure. It's part of the debate.(CROSSTALK)ROLLINS: His job as a single moderator. His style is totally different.  He's not a Chris Wallace, he's not overly aggressive. He basically is going to ask the right questions, keep the debate going, like a referee in a fight. He's not a guy that basically judges the fight. And I think to a certain extent, by doing fact-checking, you're basically taking a side, what-have-you.Let the people afterwards. Keep it going, keep the questions to where people are really interested in the show.KISSEL: I would also hope he addresses the questions that most Americans care about which is the economy and terrorism, particularly after last weekend's bombings in New York and New Jersey and the stabbings in Minnesota.BARTIROMO: Real quick, what will be success for Donald Trump?ROLLINS: He basically walks off the end of the stage with a tie or a win.BARTIROMO: What is success for Hillary Clinton?SIGMUND: She projects warmth and presidential character and capacity to lead.BARTIROMO: Warmth.OK, Mary, your thoughts?KISSEL: That Donald Trump controls himself, that he stays on message. And there's nowhere to hide in the 90-minute debate. For Hillary, it's warmth, but that's something she's simply not. So, I think --ROLLINS: She has to win, though. He doesn't.BARTIROMO: She has to win?SIGMUND: Expectations are tougher for her, no question.BARTIROMO: The expectations are here, because everybody thinks, yes, you do know everything and he's never been a politician.ROLLINS: I think he will win.BARTIROMO: You think he will win?KISSEL: It could be the only debate.SIGMUND: This debate?BARTIROMO: Wow.SIGMUND: I think he'll do well in this debate over the three. It will be clear --BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Mary, Steve, Ed. Good to see you.ROLLINS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: That will do it for ""Sunday Morning Futures"". I'm Maria Bartiromo. I'll see you tomorrow ""Mornings with Maria"" on the Fox Business Network. We got a great show as we take to you the debate and have a conversation afterwards.""MediaBuzz"" begins right now.

7	http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/06/22/donald-trump-delivers-speech-criticizing-hillary-clinton-record-and-ethics/	Donald Trump delivers speech criticizing Hillary Clinton's record and ethics	"This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" June 22, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Tucker Carlson and her full-length mirror is a compact, Dana Perino -- ""The Five.""Calling Donald Trump's attack on Hillary today ""a speech"" is like calling D-Day a nature hike:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Hillary Clinton, and as you know she -- most people know, she's a world-class liar.Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and even theft. She gets rich making you poor.No secretary of state has been more wrong, more often and in more places --Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism, everywhere she touched.ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made.Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the United States.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: There you go. He accused her of murder, corruption, lies, creating ISIS, appeasing enslavers and rapists, destroying the entire Middle East. The speech wasn't just a vehicle, it was a dump truck unloading steaming, wet garbage on Hillary's head. The only things he didn't blame her for were ""Zoolander 2,"" man buns and coconut water.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Yeah, I know. What you're seeing is ""opposite-Romney."" Trump not only takes off the gloves, he adds brass knuckles, a blow torch and death metal. He also employed political jiu-jitsu. Trump took the criticisms about his temperament, put them in a t-shirt cannon and fired them right back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office. From the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true. Her leadership style, volcanic, impulsive, disdainful and disdainful of the rules set for everyone else, hasn't changed one bit.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Volcanic, impulsive; you could say the same about Trump and be right. It's Godzilla versus Mechagodzilla and it's going to get ugly, like Tyson versus Holyfield in '97: someone is going to lose an ear. But after Trump's bad week, he needed something to help him forget the financials that are trailing him like toilet paper on a flip-flop. He got stuff wrong today, but he got one thing really right: The wrong, condemning offshore practices he once did himself, exaggerating trade numbers, hitting globalism when Americans like its benefits, also condemning stuff that he was once for, but what he got right was really big.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it. So when people ask me why I am running, I very quickly answer, I'm running to give back to this country which has been so very good to me.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: She believes she's entitled to the office. Her campaign slogan is ""I'm with her."" You know what my response is to that? I'm with you, the American people.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: There you go. This is the pernicious globalism he should be hitting, reminding us that we come first, that America as an idea is worth keeping and fighting for. It's absurd to find that idea so refreshing, but in the age of Obama, saying such things is like belching in a crowded elevator.And I should know. All right, Tucker. What did you make of the speech?TUCKER CARLSON, GUEST CO-HOST: Well, I kind of agree with you about the Hillary stuff. I mean, it's emotionally satisfying to see the dump truck unload the garbage on her head, but I think we just count the stuff already because we know it to be true, even her supporters know that she's dishonest, not a news flash. He wins when he makes the point as he did, you didn't show the clip, but that we, America went off the rails when it substituted Americanism, policies that speak to the middle class from globalism.GUTFELD: Right.CARLSON: Policies that speak to corporations. I mean, it's really easy, by the way, and this is true of most affluent people, including me, until recently, to care lot about the poor, and of course it's easy to care about the donor class that pays the bills, but caring about the middle class unfashionable, often overlooked, kind of dorky, that's the heart of America. You can't have a functioning democracy, or by the way, mark an economy without a robust, self-respecting middle class that is prospering, and we don't have one. If he sticks to that, he'll win.GUTFELD: Juan, what did you make from the other side?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, I really like that line about, ""I'm with you .""GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: ""American people."" I thought that was great (inaudible), that was terrific. Now Hillary had a good one yesterday when she said, ""I read Donald Trump's book, all of them end at Chapter 11.GUTFELD: No.WILLIAMS: That was very good, too. So we have two good lines as you said, Godzilla and Mechagodzilla, whatever. That was terrific. So, we have this dump truck unloading. The question is, what's the policy? So you have all this promise. Oh, you know what, she is not really for, as Tucker was saying, the middle class. We got to look out for the middle class, look after the American people. Where are Donald Trump's actual policies? That's what I thought was empty-handed here, because he talks about things that I've read, you know, tax hikes, but tax hikes for who? Tax cuts or I should say tax cuts for the very wealthy.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: He talks about trade and it's very interesting, because you know that's an issue that appeals to Bernie Sanders' voters, right? Let's cut back on the trade issue. She's an internationalist, she's a globalist; I'm not, I'm America first. Hey, but guess what? When the economists look at it it's going to cost Americans jobs. So I say, let me hear your actual policies Mr. Trump, and then I'll make a decision.GUTFELD: KG, what do you think of what Juan said, there was no substance to his promises.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: yeah, you know what I mean, that can come today. What I think he really needs to do is show that he was up to the task and give a little bit of a taste, you know, like a little sampler of what's to come in terms of why there are stark differences, a choice to be made here between choosing him as commander-in-chief and president and choosing Hillary Clinton. Yes, Tucker is right that people have heard these things, we kind of know it to be true, but I think when you've got sort of that like avalanche today, you know, viva basura. All the garbage at once from head, you're like, wow!GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: That is a mess. There's no way to clean up the mess on aisle seven, like it's just bye, bad, out. So, I like that. And I think, just showing that her whole candidacy and this entitlement, the idea that she deserves it, you know, not the idea of trying to earn it and that, you know, I'm with her, and when he said he's with the American people. And I particularly loved the clever little book report, you know, it was like the Clinton task .GUTFELD: Oh yes, Clinton task.GUILFOYLE: . recitation, going through all of these things. I mean, my God, she even got jewels from the Saudis. I mean, she is like, bejewel me, I'll take your money, I'll take all your cash and I'll take the oval, hand it over. So that was the feeling that I got.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: That was an example of something that bothered me about the speech. There's a lot that I like about it, but one of the things that bothered me were things -- for example, the jewels. I mean, every first lady is given jewels from world leaders and those are actually the property of the American people. And if you want to keep them, you have to pay for them. If you don't, they go over to this like amazing room at the White House.GUTFELD: I've been there.PERINO: Yeah. It's like a little vault.GUTFELD: Yeah.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: It's not that place, but -- the place where, what George Washington -- George Bush library. They had all the gifts.PERINO: Yeah, like one of -- President Kikwete gave President Bush a tiger -- no, a lion .GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: . a stuffed lion that's in there. And so it actually that belongs to the American people, that's why it's at the library --GUILFOYLE: She's not giving it back --PERINO: But I think what people would -- if you're a republican and you've liked Trump all along, this you're saying, see, I told you guys. This is the guy who will fight for us. He will fight outlandish with even more outlandish. And I think that that might help a lot. The other problems that he has are significant, but I agree that there's not, there's time to fill in the blanks because when Hillary gave her economic speech on Tuesday? Monday? Didn't you call it yesterday on ""Special Report,"" like something from a freshman doorman, where they were scratching out economic ideas?CARLSON: It so banal.PERINO: Right.CARLSON: That's not one -- when was the last time you heard Hillary say something interesting? She doesn't get credit for being as uninteresting as she is.GUTFELD: Yeah. Well, she's been --CARLSON: For me.GUTFELD: We're also, we're also too --PERINO: Right.GUTFELD: We've heard from her for so long. So why don't we hear from her right now. This is her slamming Trump today, earlier. Let's roll that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The self-proclaimed king of debt has no real ideas for making college more affordable or addressing the student debt crisis.CROWD: No.CLINTON: He has no credible plan for rebuilding our infrastructure, apart from his wall. He has no real strategy for creating jobs, just a string of empty promises. And maybe we shouldn't expect better from someone whose most famous words are -- you're fired. He's going after me personally because he has no answers on the substance.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Says a voice of a songbird.PERINO: I think her audience loves it, though.GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: I mean, there are -- it seems there's not a laugh track. I mean the people there in the audience there, they're excited, there's enthusiasm for the president -- for her to be the president if you're a democrat. And the opposite -- if you're at a Trump rally, you're going to get all of those lines. So the camps are fully set up.CARLSON: It's like a Bill Maher, show, though.GUTFELD: Yeah.(LAUGHTER)CARLSON: It' like -- God! Another thing! I'm glad to have her for something.PERINO: I never watch that.CARLSON: No matter what she says, they're going to cheer. I love --PERINO: Right.CARLSON: We need supply-side economics! Yeah!(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: A lot of stuff she said. Trump also said about infrastructure, about trade, there was some things about -- bringing jobs back and everything.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.GUTFELD: Some of the stuff could have been interchangeable, KG.GUILFOYLE: No, I think you're right. But it also depends on, you know, whose jersey you're wearing, right?GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Like who -- what's your team? What's your home team? Who do you want to win? So, in both of those speeches, when you juxtapose them like we are, there are shots up there. You see something for everybody. That's like a Hillary supporter, you've got the red meat there for like the Trump supporters and they're into that, because it what they want to hear, and you want to have enthusiasm, you know for your candidate. And the reason why Trump has done as well as he has, is because people are like, listen, this guy is an outsider, he's going to do things differently, he knows how to win, he knows was to make good deals. And he's kind of -- he has an advantage when you stand up there to talk about the jobs and the economy because he is a business person. He comes -- obviously, you know, from that sector.WILLIAMS: Well, let me just say. I think we've seen now these two speeches, and I think it's important to understand or establish the larger context, which is Hillary Clinton is leading in the polls. Hillary Clinton is leading on most issues, policy wise with voters, but the one, big one that she's not leading on -- economics.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.WILLIAMS: American voters think Donald Trump would do a better job in terms of handling the economy. That's why Hillary Clinton, I think is taking a proactive, attacking stance so early, going after Trump on this. So what does she say? She says, hey, look at all those failed casinos. Oh, don't forget, look at all of those people whose bills have not been paid by the great Donald Trump. And then she -- and then this week, Moody's Analytics came out and they said, oh, we looked at Trump's policies. We look at what he's prescribing. There would be more unemployment in the country. There would be lower wages in the country. And she is citing those statistics coming from, in fact, I think Moody's Analytics, they used to be on the Romney team, right?PERINO: I don't know.CARLSON: But here's why it doesn't work. She can't have a coherent economic message, because she's torn between two opposing and equal forces. She's got on one side the Bernie factor. She needs to win over his voters in order to win. And on the other side, she needs the banks. She needs Wall Street, the finance sector to finance -- to continue to finance her campaign. And they have diametrically opposed visions of what (inaudible) can do. So Trump can say whatever he wants, because he -- the one thing you can say about him, he actually isn't beholden to anybody, as we learned yesterday.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.CARLSON: 1.3 million in bank.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.CARLSON: You know what I mean, you know. It's his bank --PERINO: Literally.CARLSON: No, that's true.GUTFELD: But that could change, because this starts begging for money, he might be beholden even more.CARLSON: It's hard to see how a guy -- and I'm not (inaudible) for the guy. But the one thing you can say about him, he's so unpredictable.GUTFELD: Right.CARLSON: The only thing he could be reading a script from some donor, probably not.PERINO: No.GUTFELD: Yeah. But what's being in script? How did you feel about his delivery today with the -- he does a prompter, but then he feels compelled to go off a little bit.PERINO: But that -- actually, that's probably a pretty good blend for him, right? Like --GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: That's like making the pivot in his way.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: And I -- because the stiltedness of a teleprompter from the beginning. It was like, I don't understand, like it's amazing like that there's a news story that somebody is using a teleprompter, but that's like how incredibly ridiculous some of those campaigning is. I thought today was actually pretty good blend, if you can have a prepared script that's basically like bullet points .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: . and then add in your own special flair? That's perfect.WILLIAMS: Yeah, I thought it was not Lewandowski. I think this is Manafort. He's sticking to the -- he really didn't go off script very much.GUTFELD: No.WILLIAMS: And I thought it was pretty effective. I mean, in terms of Trump, I thought he delivered the message. That's why you were able to play good bytes right at the top, coming from Trump.GUILFOYLE: Figure that out, you are the message. Yeah, I think he's doing quite well with it, because he's not, you know politician, you know, by trade, but what he is, is his comfortable in his own skin and with his decisions -- hopefully good ones.GUTFELD: Yeah. Teleprompter, after a while gets very easy to learn. All right, next --(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: A big admission from Bernie Sanders.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: And an appeal today by Donald Trump for -- the democrats' voters. Stay tuned.(LAUGHTER)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: At first of Bernie Sanders today, the democratic socialist finally admitted he's likely not going to be his party's nominee.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEVE SCULLY, SENIOR EXECUTIVE PRODUCER FOR THE C-SPAN: Have you begun to prepare your speech for the convention? Will you speak at the convention?BERNIE SANDERS, PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Well, you know it's hard to say that is -- it doesn't appear that I'm going to be the nominee, so I'm not going to be determining the scope of the convention.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: You don't say.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: So, who will his supporters turn to? This is fascinating. A new poll out today shows nearly half of Bernie Sanders' supporters won't get behind Hillary Clinton, 22 percent of those say they will vote for Trump. The presumptive GOP nominee made an appeal for Sanders voters, earlier. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We'll never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who have rigged it in the first place. The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money. That's why we're asking Bernie Sanders voters to join our movement. So together, we can fix the system for all Americans, so important.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: There you go. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is a pitch. So he threw it out there, Tucker, to say hey, I want you guys, we got a Trump tent here in gold, made out of gold, and we're welcoming you in that.CARLSON: Well, I love the fact that Sanders is finally conceding he's not going to be the nominee. He's Mr. Delayed reaction.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.CARLSON: I'm not taking marijuana, but will he admit --(LAUGHTER)CARLSON: So the economics don't work?GUTFELD: Yeah. At some point, he's still a socialist.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: He's still a socialist.CARLSON: He's still (inaudible) the (inaudible), but he's, at least admitting --(LAUGHTER)CARLSON: That he's not going to be the nominee. No, I mean Trump has said this from like almost the beginning, for months ago, I could win Bernie voters and people mocked him, but there is a convergence. Certainly there is on trade, but it's bigger than just trade. I mean the average person has no idea what's in the TBB. In fact, nobody knows what's in TBB, but nobody -- the South Korean trade deals, like its opaque to the average person, but the notion that the system is rigged for a small group of people, 95 percent of the income gains that Obama go to top 1 percent, that's not a hard message. And by the way, it doesn't have to be a message that is exclusive to the left, it shouldn't be. It's not an attack on capitalism. It doesn't need to be an attack on capitalism. It's merely making the point you're going to get an unstable society if you have a concentration of wealth that's like what we're seeing here. It's just not --GUILFOYLE: Yeah.CARLSON: It's just not, you know, that can't last forever.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. All right Greg, so what do you make of it?GUTFELD: I think --GUILFOYLE: By the way .GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: . some of the numbers kind of surprising because --GUTFELD: It's very surprising, very surprising because I was, I was one of the original people to mock this idea that there was going to be a migration of Sanders people. So there's 22 percent I think is huge and big, because I don't understand how a supporter of a socialist can be a supporter for a capitalist, and also, a socialist who is so ignorant of national security. At least we know that Trump is a nationalist and is willing to like, you know, fight, you know beyond our borders in case we're threatened. I don't know anything about Sanders when it comes to national security. But, then I thought about a lot of Sanders supporters don't care about national security.WILLIAMS: Right.GUTFELD: And they don't also understand economic policy. They're just ticked off. So maybe one out of five can go to Trump, because they're non- ideological anyway -- that could be it.GUILFOYLE: Dana, from like, you know, a language and you know word choice type of thing. It was very interesting because he was really hitting on that theme of outsiders and you can't fix the system if you go with someone who has been on the inside. They're part of what's rigged it all along. What do you think about that?PERINO: Definitely worth a pitch, because there -- these people feel like they don't have anywhere to go, but I think we're actually missing one, one person and it is Gary Johnson, the libertarian candidate. If you look at the report, the poll out of Utah today, the youth there, 18 to 34, that 36 percent of them have -- they have Gary Johnson at the top. That's a libertarian candidate. Then it was Hillary, then it was somebody else, and then Trump. That end up, of course, that's Utah that's little bit different. But I'm -- but growing up out there, I won't surprise. I'm not surprised. It has changed a lot like Colorado and Utah, Wyoming, the youth out there like the libertarians a lot, because pretty much, they just want to be left alone. I don't know if the rigging of the game is enough to convince a lot of the Bernie Sanders voters to come over, but remember also what Bernie Sanders has said before, which is, it is his mission to make sure Donald Trump does not become president. So, to the extent that any of these young people are so going to listen to Bernie Sanders after this, some of them definitely will vote for Trump, but I think the majority of them will take the lead from Bernie or a president that they like, Obama.GUTFELD: You know -- would quite, it's funny because you may look at the choices, you know, if you look at Hillary, she's like the evil stepmother and Trump is her eccentric uncle. Gary Johnson is like your whacky older brother with 400 grateful dead boot legs --PERINO: And a bunch of weeds.GUTFELD: Yes.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: That was the -- that's was not I meant.PERINO: Oh.GUILFOYLE: Stop that nothing --(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Stop that nothing. Tucker -- yeah.WILLIAMS: But I will say that -- in the interview that we saw on C-Span, Bernie Sanders also said, he doesn't think Trump is going to get his voters. He said Trump is a bigot and anti-worker. And then he wants to some issues like minimum wage, immigration, taxes, guns, global warming. There's a big difference.GUTFELD: The immigration, especially.WILLIAMS: Yes.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: So there's a huge difference. And then one, one last thing Tucker, when you look at '08, the last time we had a serious contest on the democratic side, guess what, even after the primary was over, a huge number of Clinton's backers said, ""I'll never vote for Obama.""GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: And what happened by the time we got to November, it was like 90 percent of them ended up voting .PERINO: But she --WILLIAMS: . for Obama. They didn't stay home.PERINO: But Hillary Clinton did something that Bernie Sanders isn't -- is not doing, and it should probably do very soon, which is she was very gracious. She took the loss like a pro and she said, ""I'm asking for as hard as it is for me to have this loss. I'm asking if you want -- if you want to make me feel better, we have to get behind Obama.""WILLIAMS: Well, I think one other point, though is that McCain was viewed unfavorably by about 23 percent of democrats, right? So as an option, are you going to with Obama or McCain? But you know what? McCain wasn't viewed that badly by democrats; 23 percent only viewed him unfavorably.PERINO: That was just problem on the right.WILLIAMS: But then, when you come to Trump, it's like, my God, 89% percent view him unfavorably among democrats.CARLSON: One quick thing that you said, you said immigration is a deal- killer for Bernie Supporters. If you care about wages, why would you support mass immigration, which of course lowers wages?WILLIAMS: Oh.CARLSON: The supply and demand.WILLIAMS: What happens if you are an immigrant?CARLSON: If he -- if you care --WILLIAMS: What happens if you are Hispanic, Latino?CARLSON: It is not a racial thing.WILLIAMS: Oh. I see.CARLSON: It's a question of numbers. And by the way, if you care about the environment, why would you want millions more people coming? China is an environmental disaster because it's over populated. New Zealand is an environmental paradise because it's not. It's not good for the environment. It's not good for wages --PERINO: But Tucker, nobody --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: But Tucker, nobody said that Bernie Sanders voters are intellectually consistent.CARLSON: But you can make the case if you're smart enough to do --PERINO: It's Bernie who makes the case.CARLSON: No one is doing it, right?(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: (inaudible) case, right?(CROSSTALK)CARLSON: Because he's smart.GUILFOYLE: Right. Real quick, Dana, did you think that Trump made the case for his first hundred days, because he had to specify some things that people, we don't have time for the SOT, but he talked about what he would do about repealing ObamaCare, taking care of immigration .PERINO: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: . lift restrictions on energy production and pass a massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs --PERINO: I think what he actually did, instead of worrying about his first hundred days as president, I think what he just did is to try to sure up the losses that he had in the last 100 days, and he did a pretty job of it.GUILFOYLE: All right. And the lead was Supreme Court justices could be up to even, you know, maybe in forth.Coming up, democratic lawmakers stage a rare sit-in on the House floor to demand a vote on gun control. The dramatic Capitol Hill protest, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Last week, the FBI director said the bureau could not have done anything differently to have prevented the massacre. But now, yet another person has come forward to say he warned the agency about Mateen, two years ago; a friend who attended the same mosque.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MOHAMMAD MALIK, OMAR MATEEN'S FRIEND: Omar had mentioned to me that he had seen videos of Anwar al-Awlaki, which threw up a red flag for me. And I asked him what he thought of them and he told me they were very powerful, which raised a flag even more for me. After that, I contacted the FBI and (inaudible). Look, you know, this is a gentleman. At that point he was in a second marriage, he had a son. He was starting his family. I didn't think he fit the profile, but just in case, I wanted them to, you know, look into it so that nothing bad would happen to anybody.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Meanwhile, Attorney General Loretta Lynch has an unconventional idea of how we should be fighting terrorists -- kill them with kindness.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LORETTA LYNCH, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES: Our most effective response to terror and to hatred is compassion, to unity and its love.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Kimberly, let's start with the develop Muslim at the same mosque as Mateen, who goes going to the FBI -- he's doing everything that we've asked them to do which is, if you see something, say something you're worried, and not that the FBI can get everything perfect, but they missed it.GUILFOYLE: I mean it's just tough it is so tough to take. And when I -- I just think about those 49 lives that were taken, you know, and how this should have and could have been prevented. And you have someone like this, a man coming forward, doing what we have implored, you know, the Muslim community to do. It's like let's be in this together. Let's all help one another. You see something, say something. Let us know if something is amiss because you've got unique eyes and ears on a situation in real-time and you really might be on to something that maybe you think it's in insignificant.But not to someone else that can put the pieces together and may have gotten another call about that person. So, I'm so glad that this man came forward to say that he did this. I hope it encourages other people to do so and then, you know, obviously nobody feels worse about this, you know than the FBI, right? Because there were some definite signs, there was information coming forward. And, you know, they do, God bless, the best job that they can, but this is tough to take.DANA PERINO: Any thoughts on this, Tucker?CARLSON: Well yeah, this is one of a number of instances where this exact same thing happens, his co-workers ...PERINO: Yeah.CARLSON: ... at the security firm reported him to authorities, who concluded that he was working in a hostile work environment. It was their fault. I mean, look, this is a violation of the basic agreement we have with government. I send more than half of my income to the government to do a lot of things I don't like, but the basic thing they do is do their best to keep me safe.They failed in this case and yet rather than admitting that, they're blaming me and every other gun owner in America for this crime.PERINO: Yeah.TUCKER: They're saying it's your fault. Members of Congress standing up and lecturing us, this is your fault America, you have the wrong kind of firearms, you're dangerous. Actually, no it's not. We pay to you to prevent things like this from happening and yet you blame me when it happens? It's too much.PERINO: You want to comment on this on, some with this on Tucker.GUTFELD: Yeah, just -- I think the good news is that we're working hard on gender-neutral bathrooms.CARLSON: Yes ...GUTFELD: So while we're letting these things happen in San Bernardino, in Fort Hood, and the scum in Orlando and what he did, because people are fearful of actually saying something, because they might be accused of Islamophobia, but we're still tackling the stuff that matters and that's gender-free bathrooms and ...CARLSON: I'm really glad about that.GUILFOYLE: Well by the way men are filming young girls going in a Target. No, this is true, they're -- read it, one, and they're going in and filming young girls as they're changing in the changing room because the Target say you can be in there. That's where our focus on.WILLIAMS: Yeah, I can see, but allow me say, how are you going to say Islamophobia, the guy is a Muslim. The guy who said this stuff, who warned the FBI but remember.GUTFELD: I think the pursuit -- the pursuit people are fearful of harming their careers if they're seen as Islamophobic. And it's good that he did it. But remember, the neighbors in San Bernardino were afraid to say something. People knew the psychiatrist at Fort Hood was up to no good but they were scared to say something. And it is true.WILLIAMS: You know, there's a lot of Monday morning quarterbacking. And people say, oh yeah, that's why they say -- they are the ones.GUTFELD: This show is about Monday morning quarterbacking.WILLIAMS: No, no, it's important here that we set a precedent. I mean clearly we have been, as Kimberly was saying, imploring the Muslim community ...CARLSON: Yeah.WILLIAMS: ... to be cooperative with law enforcement. Here is the guy who did it. But contrary to what I'm hearing, in fact the FBI checked this guy out aggressively twice. But they came to the conclusion they had no constitutional basis, right, for in fact either holding him in prison, putting him in jail or ...CARLSON: Right.GUILFOYLE: Put him on a delayed gun list.WILLIAMS: Suspended his right.GUILFOYLE: Put him on a delayed list.GUTFELD: Valid for that maybe you would.WILLIAMS: OK, so you would check him out.GUTFELD: The big question is -- I mean the big point is, he didn't fit the profile. What does that tell you that the profile is changing? If you watch ""The Americans"" on FX, they come to America and they raise a family.PERINO: Right they are family.GUTFELD: Yeah, the KGB, that's how they did it. That's what's happening now, get married, raise a family ...PERINO: Look like you care.GUTFELD: Look like you care and then there's no profile.GUILFOYLE: So who else did that? San Bernardino.WILLIAM: Yeah, this guy is going clean, in San Bernardino ...GUTFELD: Yeah, you got ...WILLIAMS: ... the difference was the wife, the wife that came over.GUTFELD: Yeah, but the wife could have been a front.WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know, but I'm just saying, you know, when you have the FBI do their job, they can only do it up to -- I mean we live in a free society. If I say, you know Greg looks weird to me today you say that, that's not a reason to put you in jail.GUILFOYLE: No.PERINO: Can I get at ...GUTFELD: But your right, this is a free society we'll always be at risk. We know that, so let's protect ourselves.GUILFOYLE:: Now they're going to look like, you know, the Beaver Cleaver family, the Huxtables, like that's what's they'll going to look like, they're going to fit and assimilate. Oh, they're just like us and you wouldn't suspect.PERINO: But I think one comment from Tucker on the Loretta Lynch's comments about, you know, killing them with kindness, love, unity for ISIS.CARLSON: You know that was all -- it's too easy that that's T-ball and I just felt as a ...PERINO: You're more of a baseball player?CARLSON: ... as a professional here, as a professional analyst, I just -- I didn't, I felt bad.WILLIMS: Can I simply -- can I just defend.GUILFOYLE: I'll tell you, he's worse than Eric Holder.WILLIAMS: Oh men.CARLSON: That's what I would like to say.PERINO: I would go in to defend you.GUTFELD: I would like to defend her because I think -- she might be, but when she's talking about love and compassion, she's talking about the community. That has to be paired with, you know ...PERINO: Yeah.GUTFELD: ... security and exacting justice. If that's missing, then compassion is pointless, right? You've got to have that -- you've got to have the big stick.CARLSON: If the AR-15 is missing, it's all pointless. So the message here -- no I'm serious why should I not be -- why am I the threat?WILLIAMS: You, if you have an AR-15 why are you the threat?CARLSON: Yes, why am I the treat? I pay my taxes, I don't break the law, I'm not a radical Muslim. Why I am treat to anybody, A and B, why should I get a lot to protect my family then? What future?GUTFELD: Yeah.WILLIAMS: You know, we're doing this weapon of war?GUTFELD: Is that what?(CROSSTALK)PERINO: That is not a weapon of war. It's not a military and raid weapon.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: No, look Juan, Juan, (inaudible) but a metaphor for you.WILLIAMS: Yes.GUTFELD: You know when a kid who's 18 buys a Toyota Corolla and zoops (ph) it up. He puts lights around the license plate.GUILFOYLE: Oh yeah.GUTFELD: He puts new rims, that's the gun. It's just a 22 gun that's painted black and has little gadgets added.WILLIAMS: Yeah, and here's the thing about ...(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: the weapon of war equivalent is the M-16, OK, so let's ...(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: OK, a magazine ...(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: ... Armalite rifle, that could have.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: You know why? Because you have dodo birds talking that know nothing about weapons.PERINO: It is not talking about this show. Now ahead, some twisted logic from a co-host on ""The View"""" she accuses Donald Trump of provoking the assassination attempts against him this weekend, and you're going to hear that next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: Well this weekend, a British man here in the country illegally -- an illegal alien was arrest for trying to assassinate Presidential Candidate Donald Trump.There's no possible way to justify the attempted assassination of course, but one of the co-hosts on ""The View"" a daytime program did yesterday implying that Trump is to blame for provoking the lunatic who wanted to kill him. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SUNNY HOSTIN, ABC ""THE VIEW"" SENIOR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT & ANALYST: It's wrong what happened. I mean, you never supposed to violently try to take someone out because of their views.But with the Trump campaign and all that campaign rhetoric, to incite violence, I mean, he did say, you know, ""I should punch this guy out"", one of the protesters.It makes me wonder whether or not that campaign, the vileness of it and all the rhetoric is going to bring more people out of the woodwork like that.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: So, Juan, how is this different from blaming an assault victim for her own assault. I mean, for being dressed provocatively. She's blaming the target of an attempted assassination.JUAN: Well, I don't think there's any justification for it, because I mean -- she even used the term, violent. I mean, there's no way that someone is going to try to kill me and you say, oh yeah, Juan -- why did Juan say that or do that?GUTFELD: I see some of your -- the letters.WILLIAMS: Oh, I know, I know, I did blame for a lot around here. But, I'm just telling you, I don't think there's any excuse for it.Now, she is right to this extent. The context and violence we have seen at Trump events and rallies, whether it's come from people who are agitative, by being Trump's blame some Sanders people in the past or we've seen violence inside Trump rallies.If that's what she's saying that, ""Oh gee, there's a pattern here,"" I understand. But you can't blame somebody who is the target of an assassination.CARLSON: So, I mean, do you forfeit your right to your life or to your exercise to the First Amendment if you say things the left disagrees with?GUTFELD: If you -- imagine if you said that about other assassination attempts.CARLSON: Well, I know.GUTFELD: I mean, I would even -- I could mention some very -- to some very famous names. If you had said that you would not have a career, you would be frog-marched out of the building.But, you know what, it's our fault. Getting politics or any political opinions from ""The View,"" is like getting career advice from the homeless, it's on you.So, I don't think it's like, you know, it doesn't make sense. I don't know. The point about blaming the victim is I think the most important thing here.And I do -- to Juan's point, I don't think any Trump fans ever went to anybody else's rallies to pick fights, right? I don't think that have happened.CARLSON: So, I feel Dana, I mean, not to make some dippy generalization about America, but it does feel like there's an acceleration cycle of lunatic rhetoric going on.PERINO: Well, the more outrageous, the more you get attention and you get a little sound byte on The Five later on. I mean, that's how you get attention.Let's be clear, this is a British man, he's 20-years-old, he had never even shot a gun except for like two days before he have had this idea in his head that somebody was telling him to kill Donald Trump.So, he should have practiced a little bit more care. And I think one of the reasons that the FBI or Secret Service, like let's just get this out. You don't want copycats.GUTFELD: He's mentally ill. I mean ...CARLSON: Wait! -- give ""The View"" credit for at least mentioning it. I didn't see this in any other news outlets.I mean, so, here is -- the presidential candidate of the one of major parties, someone tries to assassinate him, an illegal alien tries and nobody notices?GUILFOYLE: Yeah. So, I know, I read about this, I'm like, wow, why isn't this, you know, the lead people talking about this.So, it is important to get it out there and then I love the fact that they moved in on a very quickly to be able to do something about it because you can't have a situation like this.And especially, when you have somebody, obviously he has serious psychological problems if he's hearing voices or something that maybe ...PERINO: And he's tried to take officer's gun.GUILFOYLE: Yeah. I mean ...GUTFELD: That was his plan for a year.GUILFOYLE: .... that's right. So, when he's had these kinds of thoughts about it where he's been, you know, really focusing on and obsessing on. And it's a dangerous situation.I mean, I think for anybody that runs for office or serves in public office to see -- we saw happen over in, you know, one of the British parliament members that was killed, it's very tough ...WILLIAMS: You know what's interesting to me is so Trump was on ""Fox & Friends,"" and they asked him about it and he was like, I don't care -- yeah.But, I think part of it is that the guy didn't come close. That the authorities were able to disarm, he never got the gun, they stopped him quickly. And it's interesting to me that you guys are willing to talk about the fact, as Greg said, that he's mentally ill in this situation.GUTFELD: Well, it's actually -- there's no ideology like Islamism behind him. He's definitely, he's looking to -- he had serious mental issues and people knew about it.WILLIAMS: Right, because someone paid him.GUILFOYLE: Because someone was telling him to ...GUTFELD: Yes, yeah.WILLIAMS: He's drunk (ph) -- that's what it is.CARLSON: All right. Next up, do you hate your job? Do you wish you could quit right now today? Would you do that without giving notice to your employer?Well, a growing number of workers, most of them, young, are doing that. But are the consequences worth the short-term satisfaction they gain from giving the finger to the man. Up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DONNIE AZOFF: What work -- what do you do?JORDAN BELFORT: I'm a stock broker.AZOFF: Stock broker?BELFORT: Yeah.AZOFF: Jobs furniture (ph). I tell you what, you show me a pay stub for $72,000, and I quit my job right now and I work for you.Hey, Paulie, what's up? No, yeah, everything is fine. Hey listen, I quit.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: A lot of people fantasize about doing just that, saying, ""Sayonara"" to that crummy job.According to ""The Wall Street Journal"", a growing number of employees are actually doing it. Telling their bosses I quit and giving no notice.Some are young employees who may feel frustrated by the limited prospects of their jobs or they have little attachment to the job.But others are older employees who may feel overworked, underappreciated after their years of labor. So, could that hasty exit hurt job prospects later? Or is it just the new reality? What do you think, Dana?PERINO: Well, I think that if you see something that is unethical or criminal and nobody -- you can't right the wrong and you cannot be a part of it, it's acceptable, or if you win the lottery. That would be acceptable. But, otherwise, as I give the two weeks' notice, don't burn a bridge, try to stick it out. Two weeks goes by fast.GUTFELD: One of your job is burning bridges. Like you work for the burning bridges ...PERINO: But you could do it two more weeks.GUILFOYLE: Oh my God. Don't encourage them (ph).WILLIAMS: Right, you know, what was interesting to me in this is how the world changes, because at my age I think, whoa, you know, what, you work for a company for a long time and -- but in fact, according to the numbers here, this is so shocking to me, it says here workers 20-24 change jobs every 16 months, 25-34 every three years, 25 and over, they change jobs every five years. So it's now in America, the job market are constant churning.CARLSON: But that's not what this is about. This is thoughtlessness. I mean, for ones, having been fired with four kids, I'm always grateful to work for one. And even if you're not grateful to work, you ought to be polite enough not to do this to an employer. I'm mad when people do it to me as an employer. And I'll tell you the problem is the internet, which -- the whole message of the internet, take three steps back, it's you're a precious snowflake.Your voice matters. We care about you. The message to the workplace is, we don't care about you at all, shut up and work. And so that is, you know, cognitively dissonant to millennials and they're like what? You are not listening to my feelings.PERINO: Right.CARLSON: You don't care about me as a person. And then they split.GUTFELD: But there's a greater message here and I've said as many times, anything that feels really, really good is wrong.PERINO: Don't do it.GUTFELD: All fantasies are bad. The idea of quitting your job feels so good, that you know it must be bad. And to your point, the only people who can get away with this are people who don't have kids.CARLSON: It's exactly right.GUTFELD: This is a luxury for people with no responsibilities like me.WILLIAMS: Well, but so -- but KimberlyPERINO: Oh, do you have something to tell us?WILLIAMS: Here's a thing. A lot of these people say if you don't take a new job offer immediately, that employer could rescind the offer while you're in that two-week interim. So you want to jump at the new job or you say, hey, get lost to the old boss.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, this is so bad and every time I talk to a young person we do mentoring and there's a lot of it, I tell them, do not -- you may want to have a career change or a job change, et cetera, one, you better treat people with class and second, you never know when one of those people will be the boss at the next job. You might need a good recommendation, a review, et cetera, don't burn bridge, be courteous, be appreciative to have that job. There maybe a day you'll wish you were back at that job you thought was beneath you, and then for sure don't quit your job without having another offer and give appropriate notice.As you would want to, you know, we wouldn't leave somebody hanging like that, it's always -- I haven't seen it turn out well at all when people are like, ""Oh, I'm done, I quit, I'll just look around and then I'll find something."" That never works out.PERINO: Yeah right.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Having you here today I sense you got upset. Somebody has turned this into reality in your work life?CARLSON: Actually I still have a laptop of one of my employees.WILLIAMS: All right. One more thing, up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: One more thing, one.WILLIAMS: All right. Have you ever walked on water? Well, go to Italy. It's possible. The artist known as Christo, has installed a new art exhibit on lake Iseo, and it's called floating piers, here's how it works. It consists of 100,000 square meters of beautiful glistening yellow-orange fabric. You can see it there. And what they do is they attach it to more than 220,000 floating cubes and they attach those over some concrete floating buoys.Unbelievable, the result is two miles of walkways that consist of two connect -- I should say two small islands, to the small town of Sulzano. The exhibit is a work in progress. They've been trying to put this together for 15 years.GUTFELD: You know this guy ...WILLIAMS: But it's only going to last for 16 days, so get your flight to Italy now, closes July 3rd.GUTFELD: This is the only artist where people die. You know that? Well, like they build the stuff and it falls over, there's been casualties because of ...WILLIAMS: But they had the gates in central park. And ...(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Who is next?PERINO: Me.GUTFELD: Go.PERINO: OK, because I want to you meet this guy. His name is Joseph Okal. He is a chess coach and he led the girl's team in Englewood, Chicago, to a national championship. But guess what, he has been expelled from the Chicago teachers' union for choosing to coach the team instead of taking part in a union's one-day walkout in April. This is according to a CBS2 report.GUILFOYLE: Terrible.PERINO: This is the letter expelling him. He doesn't know if he will have a job because of this decision. And here's him talking about it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOSEPH OKAL, CHESS COACH: I think it's all a matter of the principles we take in our lives. I can be a sacrificial lamb. But it's the kids that I am concerned about.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: So, that's the kind of teacher that you think, you know, who would do the right thing on behalf of the kids. And he, Joseph Okal, is going to be on Megyn Kelly's show tonight to talk about it.GUTFELD: Well, I think the union made a bad move. All right.PERINO: OK.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Greg's sports corner.GUTFELD: I'm going to show you the best soccer clip there is if you're not familiar with soccer, it's a sport where you can't use your hands, and if something happens you fall down and cry. This is Cristiano Ronaldo, is that his name, being interviewed? See he used his hands. He used his hands, there you go. That's why soccer is so exciting. All right, I speed through that, so Kimberly go.GUILFOYLE: OK, all right, he's hot. But I don't know what else you're doing with that. OK. So, Tim Tebow and Shaquille O'Neal were among a group of local athletes who visited Orlando. This is really fantastic. They went to the regional medical center on Monday to comfort the victims of last week's terror attack.They both have connections to the area. Tebow as you know grew up in Jacksonville, went to the University of Florida, and O'Neal lives in Orlando currently and played his first four seasons with the Orlando Magic. Tebow in particular, I don't know if you remember the story, it's heartwarming about the bartender who was injured and they had someone holding him to stop the bleeding. Well, that was Tebow's high school teammate, Rodney Sumpter, and really incredible story. Nice of them to do.CARLSON: OK, a confession, I like James Carville. Yes, he is -- I know you can't understand him. Yes, his politics are stupid but he is a great man and hilarious. And tomorrow night he's being roasted at the Kennedy Center in Washington, I'm a part of it, Bob Saget is hosting it. It should be hilarious.I don't know, I guess Al Jazeera (ph) in a business. I don't know if we can watch that, probably C-SPAN, but he should.GUTFELD: Very handsome man.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: You know -- Steve Scully from C-SPAN getting the shout out on live cast.GUTFELD: All right, ""Special Report"" is up next.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.SHANNON BREAM, GUEST HOST: Breaking tonight, the first GOP presidential debate is less than a week away. And some candidates are fighting to secure a spot on the big stage.Good evening. Welcome to ""The Kelly File."" I'm Shannon Bream in for Megyn Kelly. One of the biggest obstacles to these candidates' success is the fact that the potential field has now swelled to some 17 different faces. Fox News will host the top 10 contenders on Thursday in Cleveland. The Real Clear politics average of polls gives us a good snapshot of the field. Though this is not the guide that Fox News Channel will use to determine who makes the final cut. And as we get closer to the debate tonight, well, some of the candidates are already making headlines.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEB BUSH, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Over time, the Trump phenomenon will either succeed or fail based on his proposals.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You call it a phenomenon as it's something that's --BUSH: The fact you are asking me about it, you're not asking about Scott Walker or other really well qualified candidates. It is definitely a phenomenon.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What section of America do you represent?DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think I represent a big question, I guess the poll had me with 16 or 17 and candidates had me at 25 percent. And the next person was at 12 percent. So, that's a big difference. So, we represent a very big section of this country.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not the immigrant population presumably.TRUMP: Excuse me?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not many of the immigrant population presumably.TRUMP: I did well. In fact, the Hispanics, a poll came out two days ago. Where I'm number one with the Hispanics. I know you are surprised to hear that. But I'm number one with Hispanics. And I said that if I get the nomination, I will win with the Hispanics.GOV. SCOTT WALKER, R-WIS., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Voters want to hear who you are for or who you are against. I said consistently Donald Trump could speak for himself the other day when he went after me specifically. I just said, hey, he can speak for himself, but he's using the talking points of the Democrats. Those talking points haven't worked very well in the last four years when we win three elections.SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Television works, Wolf if you give some other candidates time from 8:00 in the morning to 8:00 at night all day long every day for three weeks I'm guessing some other candidates might rise as well. So, for example, while some people are hearing about one candidate all the time, very few people know that I have offered a tax code.MIKE HUCKABEE, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This president's foreign policy is the most feckless in American history. He's so naive. He would trust the Iranians and he would take the Israelis and basically march them to the door of the oven.GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, R-N.J., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Don't talk to me about being anti-gun as governor and raise something to me that was -- listen. That was 20 years ago. And if you want to debate me, come in the top ten, run for president and come to Fox in Cleveland on August 6. And I'm happy to debate you.(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: Pollster Frank Luntz is CEO of Luntz Global, Frank, it is going to be so much fun. Are you ready?FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER: I'm ready. In fact, I'm expecting a new drinking games that are going to be created out of the debate on August 6. But there are two key points that I want to raise. Number one, is that because we are still six months away from the first vote in Iowa and New Hampshire, it's going to be more about personality than it is about policy. And the candidates may not wish it to be that way. But voters are sizing up these candidates to decide whether or not they like them, whether or not they empathize with them, whether or not there is a connection.And that's more important now than where they stand on the specific issues. And second and this is specifically for Donald Trump. It's that old Simon and Garfunkel song ""The Boxer."" And Paul Simon wrote, a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest. That's what's happening with Donald Trump. If you like him, you love what he's saying. If you don't like him, you hate what he's saying. And each person hear what he says differently depending where they stand in the political aisle.BREAM: Now, he is topping almost every single recent poll across the board. So, we don't know which version of him is going to show up. He says he'll going to be respectful but he's very bombastic. And so, you have to think about each of the candidates who stands to gain by engaging him? Who stands to lose by engaging him directly?LUNTZ: I'm not convinced that anyone stands on engaging him. I had the chance to do it myself several weeks ago. And I understand what it is to feel the wrath of Donald Trump. Look, he's credible. He's tough. I'm surprised that he's not prepping for the debate because no matter how much you know, you never know enough of the details. But that's the kind of guy who he is.BREAM: Do you think he's managing expectations there because this guy is smart. He has been very successful on a number of things. Love him or hate him, I don't know. Because I mentioned that to somebody else. Like, gosh, I can't believe he keeps saying, I'm just going to show up. I am who I am. Do you think he's secretly taking us out and he really is doing a lot of debate prep?LUNTZ: Actually, no, I don't. It may be. But he's not asking you to vote for him based on his knowledge of specific policy. He's asking you to vote for him and he says it again and again because of the art of the deal. Because of leadership. Because of the determination. He's asking people to vote for him because of a passion, rather than a policy. And early on in this election process that is a very smart strategy.BREAM: Yes. I wondered how it would work for him once we got to these debates in longer term. Because having interviewed him myself, he will continue to return to what he's best at. He'll says, I'm the only one who knows how to create jobs. I'm the only one who's been successful businessman. I know how to turn things around. But then when you say, how would you do that as president? How would you work with folks on Capitol Hill? He returns to the -- I want to make America great. So, I wonder how long he'll be able to go on those ideas, those big concepts that people seem very enamored of versus having to do a deep dive on policy at some point.LUNTZ: Well, frankly it depends on how the media treats him. Those candidates who are angry, the Trump has gotten so much coverage, they are right to be angry. There is been a lot of more focus on Donald Trump who is somewhere between 20 and 25 percent. He's getting over 50 percent of the coverage. So that he's crowding out other candidates with their messages. But equally important, the way that the media treats him -- sometimes with respect. More often with scorn. He's now becoming the iteration of anger that the public has towards the mainstream media and their frustration with America's elite. Every time that Trump speaks against you all, he goes up another two points.BREAM: Yes.LUNTZ: And so, the press is actually creating that search for Donald Trump.BREAM: So, although he's at the top of the most of the polls, he's also at the top of the polls for a person you would never vote for according, you know, GOP primary. So, let's talk about some of the other people. Who do you think will be a good debater who will have a chance to shine on the stage?LUNTZ: First person I go to is Marco Rubio. Because he has the best positive message of any of the candidates. It's very emotional, it's very personal. And I know from the work I have done that people reacted positively. The second person I'm going to be looking for is Chris Christie. And you showed a segment there. He has got the best sound bites. He's the most likely to start yelling at somebody of anyone up on stage. Not only will he be entertaining but he is going to be tough. And the third person I look for is Governor Scott Walker, current governor, Wisconsin, a blue state. He has got a very strong record and he has got a very gentle way of communicating. So, those are the three people that I am going to be watching.BREAM: Let's talk about Ben Carson a little bit. A brilliant doctor. He has a lot of grassroots support. People really adore him, the people who support him. He's got such a laid back way of talking, even when he's his most passionate about some idea or policy, he does have some depth. But do you think that is going to work for him in the debate?LUNTZ: He has got significant depth. And the thing I find interesting about him is that if you have got Christie and Trump on one end and then Carson is exactly the opposite. The level of civility and decency that republican primary voters should appreciate. But if I were Caron's advisor, I would also be saying that you've got to speak up, you've got to speak out. That your normal way of backing up and being civil, there are ten other people -- there are nine other people on stage. You're got to be heard.BREAM: Yes. And you may get run over with this group, with those other nine who are up there. Let me ask you last about Ted Cruz. He was a champion debater. I have seen him argue cases at the Supreme Court. He's very convincing.LUNTZ: The key to this debate is not the overall presentation. It's the one or two sound bites. It's that seven seconds that matters most. And I'm convinced that Ted Cruz will have one of those two or three that we're going to see again and again. There is no presidential candidate better than Cruz in delivering something that's incredibly powerful in a really short amount of time.BREAM: All right. We will see how it all plays out. And we know, afterwards as well, you will going to be giving some post-debate analysis with a focus group for THE KELLY FILE. And so, we'll look forward toward to.LUNTZ: I am going to make three or four Republicans very happy and three or four Republicans very angry. But that's what I do.BREAM: That's your job. All right. Frank, thank you so much. Great to see you this Friday night.LUNTZ: Thank you.BREAM: All right. Could we soon see federal agents seizing the private e- mail server Hillary Clinton used as secretary of state?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)EDWARD MACMAHON, JR., NATIONAL SECURITY ATTORNEY: In most situations like this you would expect that a warrant would be issued.(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: Why the latest document dump is raising new questions on whether Mrs. Clinton violated the law.Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge, Fox News digital politics editor Chris Stirewalt, they are both here, next.Plus, breaking news tonight. A federal judge has just granted an abortion group's request to shut down those shocking undercover videos. And Jon Stewart coming under fire for getting too close to the commander-in-chief. Howie Kurtz on Stewarts's White House meetings and his new attacks. That's Jon Stewart on Fox News. Surprise.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JON STEWART, COMEDIAN: I assume the insinuation here is, I was summoned to the White House so Obama and I could coordinate on his agenda.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM: Breaking tonight, serious new questions over whether Hillary Clinton's unprecedented e-mail set-up as secretary of state is in violation of the law. As the nation's top diplomat, Clinton believed to be the first person in her position to use a private e-mail server kept in her home. Two years later, Mrs. Clinton returned some documents to the State Department and deleted the rest. The agency is releasing her e-mails to the public and we are finding dozens of what appear to be classified documents, that's raising new concerns.Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge in Washington.CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, if you do a search through the more than 1300 documents dropped today using a code for classified information. You'll find 37. This after the intelligence community watch dog concluded there are potentially hundreds of classified documents on Clinton's personal server like this one between aide Huma Abedin and then Secretary of State Clinton. Briefing her in advance of a call with Abbas, we believed that to be the Palestinian leader and all of the details are wiped. Classified emails on Hillary Clinton's personal server and the backup copy on a thumb drive held by her lawyer David Kendall may in fact be a violation of 18 U.S. code 1924, governing the unlawful removal and storage of classified information.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MACMAHON: In most situations like this you would expect that a warrant would be issued and the marshals and the Feds, FBI, somebody would go and get that thumb drive and take it somewhere where it would be considered safe by the government.(END VIDEO CLIP)HERRIDGE: Court documents filed in the prosecution of former CIA Director David Petraeus strongly suggest a double standard. The retired general was prosecuted for the unauthorized removal, sharing and storage of classified information held at his home. Quote, ""The FBI executed a court-authorized search warrant at Petraeus residence and seized the black books from an unlocked desk drawer in the first floor staid of the Petraeus residence."" As whether she would take action to secure the material, the Attorney General Loretta Lynch was non-comital today saying, the matter is still under review.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LORETTA LYNCH, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: The inspectors general for the State Department and at least one other I.G. are reviewing how material was handled. We will review it as we review all referrals to us and take whatever steps are appropriate, if any, at the appropriate time.(END VIDEO CLIP)HERRIDGE: FOX news has also learned that classified e-mails on Mrs. Clinton's personal server contained information from as many as five intelligence agencies -- Shannon.BREAM: Catherine, thank you so much. All right. Here now on the possible political fallout for Mrs. Clinton. Fox News digital politics editor Chris Stirewalt spending his Friday night with us on ""The Kelly File."" Hi, Chris.CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Team Bream. Glad to be here.BREAM: Listen. Today was busy. We got a truckload of information from the Clinton camp.STIREWALT: Well, yes. Look, first we have evidence -- further evidence that Hillary Clinton is selling Democrats a pig in a poke that she said, oh, there was no classified information. Oh, there was some classified information. Ah-ha, psych. And what it reveals to Democrats as they see they're probably prohibitive front-runner was not honest with them. Did not tell them. Did not disclose the extent of the liabilities in her e- mail scandal with the home browser and all that stuff. And it was going to be cauterize. The other evidence was destroyed. You will not get the server. This hurts but it's going to be gone. Now we see the drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip. Constant, oh, well, maybe we weren't on the level about that. And maybe there is still a thumb drive. And sorry about that other thing. So, Democrats continue to have sort of salt rubbed in this wound. And it's no fun.BREAM: Okay. But today we also got in addition to the e-mails which we are still parsing through and they're all kinds of -- I mean, if you get an e-mail that's almost completely redacted so you can't read any of it and it is identified as potentially classified, you've got to wonder if there was concern about the information. But we also got income and tax documents over the last eight years. And listen, this is America. The Clintons have done a good job. You know, I don't fault them for that. But it's hard to rail against the one percent when, you know, based on the records that we got today.STIREWALT: Let me put a finer point on it. She put out not her health records but a doctor's note basically that said she has got a glandular issue but she is basically healthy and she'll be fine to be president. I don't know if that will pass long term. But that's what she's offering. On the other hand holy Crocono (ph), they made more than $140 million American dollars from 2007 until today. You put that together with their haul from 2000 when they left the White House, we are talking about a quarter billion dollars. That is an enormous sum. And do you know what they did to get it? They just had to beat themselves, they gave speeches, they wrote books, they were famous, they were influential. She was powerful. She was a senator. She was the secretary of state. He was flying around on 747s and having a big time. But all they had to do was be themselves and people gave them all this money. Now, she says that money didn't affect the way she did her job, won't affect the way she did it as president. But a quarter billion for just being famous, holy Crocono?BREAM: Listen. You and keep this up. We'll going to have to put a little southern subtitles on here for the people --STIREWALT: I'm sorry. Crocono is a forbidden word?BREAM: Can we say things like bless her heart? We'll subtitle and we'll fix that later.STIREWALT: Yes, ma'am.BREAM: Do you think because of that amount of money that she's made -- anybody in America for being able to do that. But do you think that's why Bernie Sanders is gaining with the kind of the further left, populist kind of feel?STIREWALT: I think she -- I think it's not because of necessarily they don't like her having money, I think it's because they don't thrust her and they think that she will burn them bad when she gets in the general election. She is in many ways the Democrats' Romney, she is this mega rich person, she's got the out of touch problem. She's got trust problems with the base. And she's going to slog on to the nomination and then she's going to have a democratic base that looks there and says, no way, sister.BREAM: Yes. But a lot of those people aren't going to cross over and vote for, you know, one of the guys on the other side.STIREWALT: All the Republicans need them to do is exactly what Barack Obama needed Republicans to do in 2012. Just stay home. That's all the Republicans need the Democrats to do in 2016 is just stay home for Hillary and they'll have a great ole time.BREAM: Only about 16, 17 months to go, Chris.STIREWALT: Yay!BREAM: Thank you so much. Happy Friday night.STIREWALT: Happy Friday to you.BREAM: All right. A double murder in Montana. It's reigniting the immigration debate tonight. Brand new questions surrounding this suspect and why he was never deported.Plus, Howie Kurtz is here with new reaction to Jon Stewart's meetings with the President and his latest attack on Fox News.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEWART: Was the President of the United States trying to influence or intimidate or flatter me? My guess is -- uh-huh. Did it work? It might have.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM: Jon Stewart set to sign off from ""The Daily Show"" next week but not without controversy. New report that Stewart made two previously unpublicized visits to the White House. Stewart is poking fun at his critics.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEWART: I assume that the insinuation here is I was summoned to the White House so Obama and I could coordinate on his agenda.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The next ""Daily Show"" there is Jon Stewart making fun of Vladimir Putin. And so, it worked from the White House point of view.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Interesting.STEWART: Interesting. So you believe as Russian troops gather at the border of the Ukraine, Obama summoned me.(LAUGHTER)Just in case he needed help turning young Americans against Putin.(END VIDEO CLIP)Howie Kurtz, is the host of ""MediaBuzz"" on FNC. All right. Howie, he does this a lot. This kind of disarming, I'm just a comedian. But he knows how influential he is and the White House does, too.HOWIE KURTZ, HOST, ""MEDIABUZZ"": He's just a comedian. He's told me that many times. This was the final round of sparring between me and Jon Stewart over the years. And, you know, this story is damaging for him because it undercuts his persona, his image as a truth-teller who stands up to the prevaricating politicians and pundits and kind of makes him look like just another liberal partisan who got spun. So, when he came back at me and at FOX after nine minutes of jokes and he's very good at that, of course. Let's take a look at what he finally came down to.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEWART: I can understand if there are some folks at FOX who are concerned that any meeting that I take with a powerful individual should be disclosed lest it be considered possible collusion. Was the president of the united states trying to influence or intimidate or flatter me, my guess is uh-huh.(LAUGHTER)Did it work? Might have.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: And that was precisely my point.BREAM: Yes. The thing is they would not engage with him if they didn't acknowledge or recognize the amount of influence that he has. Especially with the very demo target-rich audience and the fact is that, you know, I understand the White House took calls that were coming from people related to ""The Daily Show."" I mean, they didn't get blown off. Because they knew it was a good relationship to have.KURTZ: Well, Jon Stewart has done a lot to change TV news. He has had a big impact. But he does always retreats to this ""I'm just a comedian"" when in fact he does and has used ""The Daily Show"" to influence the political debate. The White House knows this which is why he got these coveted invitations. And by the way, for him to say, oh, these weren't really secret meetings because they were buried in tens of thousands of pages of visitor logs is kind of a joke.BREAM: Yes. Because I don't remember hearing about it. A lot of times, there is a famous guest and somebody coming, we all hear about it. You try to get a shot of them coming or going for the President and for the White House.KURTZ: And by the way, journalists and commentators and even anchors on the day of the State of the Union go to the White House and have off the record meetings with plenty of presidents. Sometimes it leaks out, sometimes it doesn't. Here, if Jon Stewart, it's just a misdemeanor but if he had said, hey, I was at the White House, we chatted, we had salmon, you know, fine. But the fact that he didn't level with his viewers about this and then made some comments about the very issues Obama was pursuing at the time like standing up to Russia's Vladimir Putin, I think has made it a bit of an embarrassing episode for him.BREAM: Who do you think is going to miss Jon Stewart more -- you or President Obama?KURTZ: Well, I probably give the nod to President Obama. Barack Obama likes that show and likes Jon Stewart so much that he's had seven appearances, all very friendly as you recall. Jon Stewart not that friendly to George W. Bush. But I am going to miss him both because I think he's funny even when he chops up the clips and takes shots at me and other and obviously does at the FOX, he's done in at CNN as well. But every time he does this, I have a segment on my show. So, in the sense, I'm sure I will miss him a bit as well.BREAM: All right. We will see you there on Sunday for ""MediaBuzz.""KURTZ: Excellent.BREAM: Thank you, Howard.KURTZ: Have a nice weekend.BREAM: You too.All right. Breaking tonight, a federal judge has just granted an abortion group's request to shut down those shocking under cover videos of Planned Parenthood.Next up, Congressman Trey Gowdy on how this may impact the new push to defund the nation's largest abortion provider.Plus, did Timothy -- Cardinal Dolan just compared Donald Trump to the KKK? We're going to straighten this out with Father Jonathan Morris. He's here on Cardinal Dolan's controversial critic and Trump's immigration stance.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: But, look, it sounds cold and it sounds hard. We have a country. Our country is going to hell. We have to have a system where people are legally in our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM: Breaking tonight, a federal judge has blocked the release of undercover video meetings that involving the National Abortion Federation, its members in secret meetings, its employees. Some of those may involve Planned Parenthood. Congressman Trey Gowdy is here with his new push to defund Planned Parenthood, just how they'll go on Capitol Hill, but first. Trace Gallagher, with the Breaking News, Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, LOS ANGELES: Shannon, over the past two years, The Center for Medical Progress, a pro-life group has taken undercover videos of the educational meetings of the National Abortion Federation and abortion provider. So the NAF sued to keep those videos from being released arguing, they could lead to death threats saying, quote, ""The broader public interest can be served by preventing defendants from harassing, intimidating and inciting violence against NAF, its employees and its members."" Today, a federal judge decided with NAF, banning CMP from releasing videos. And that ruling comes on the heels of a California superior court, issuing a Temporary Restraining Order, preventing CMP from releasing undercover videos of a company that buys fetal tissue for research. Pro-life advocates say the legal action is just an attempt to hide the horrible truth. So far, CMP has released three different videos showing senior level employees of Planned Parenthood casually talking about selling fetal tissue, and graphically explaining techniques used to remove the most valuable parts of aborted babies. The most recent video shows the vice president and medical director of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains talking about how to maximize profits while avoiding legal consequences. Of course, selling fetal tissue for profit is against the law. CMP claims it has at least nine more undercover videos, though it's unclear if any will be released. And amid the controversy, Hillary Clinton acknowledged this week that she found the Planned Parenthood videos disturbing. Saying that while Planned Parenthood has done good work for women, these raises about -- questions about the whole process, though she didn't expound on exactly what process. But last night, she posted on Twitter, quoting here, ""Proud to stand with Planned Parenthood and for access to quality, affordable health care for women, men and young people."" There of course, as you know is a push to cut off Planned Parenthood's federal funding. Shannon.BREAM: Trace, thank you so much. On that, joining us now, South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy has joined the effort to defund Planned Parenthood. And the stakes could be pretty high here. Congressman, thank you for joining us.REP. TREY GOWDY, R-S.C.: Yes, ma'am. Thank you for having me.BREAM: All right. You have done something you don't often do, which is sign your name on a letter with other members of Congress, basically standing up and saying, this is my position. I'm not gonna move from it. In this case you are all saying -- it's basically, you're not gonna vote for any funding measure that includes continued funding for Planned Parenthood. And you know, that there's gonna be on a collision course with possibly being responsible for being accused of shutting down the government, if you maintain this position. So why are you taking it?GOWDY: Well, because I don't believe in infanticide, Shannon. And there are certain things that define us as a decent people, as people of good conscience. And when you watch these videos as barbaric and depraved as they are, when you are discussing the selling of body parts while you're eating a salad, like you are talking about a stock tip, and the latest video where you are right on the precipice, right on the precipice of discussing homicide. If you look at the quote, ""Folks who come in after delivery, but still want a procedure,"" what does that mean? If that's not partial birth abortion, what does it mean? The people that I work for, Shannon do not want to fund that. So you know people can disagree about a woman's right to choose and Roe versus Wade and its (Inaudible). But this is barbaric, and it is depraved, and if the president wants to insist on a government shutdown, so he can fund something that I didn't even -- I didn't even think Planned Parenthood was necessary after ObamaCare. I thought ObamaCare provided health care and access to everyone. So why do we need Planned Parenthood to prop up the abortion industry? I'm not gonna fund it.BREAM: OK. Are there democrats, pro-life or not? Are these people have concerned about these video that you think will join republican efforts?GOWDY: Well, I don't know. I would think all people of good conscience would just be sickened by what they have watched. Now, will there be folks out there who are able to rationalize it? I'm sure there will be. And I suspect that there will be a funding mechanism this fall and there will be no government shutdown and make no mistake. I don't want the government shutdown and neither do the 18 people who signed the (inaudible) letter. But you know, Shannon, you have to stand for something as a people. I mean, what defines us as a people? I am speaking to a death penalty conference tomorrow. There is more sobriety in discussing the heinous acts of death row inmates than there was in the discussion of selling baby body parts. So if death is not to fund as a people, then perhaps, I'm in the wrong line of work and I'll maybe in the wrong republic. The America that I believe and the people that I represent, do not expect me to fund the barbarism that the depravity that I have seen on these videos.BREAM: You know if it gets to the president staff, he's going to veto it. So is it a full band?GOWDY: Yeah, I -- well, he -- you know what, the president loves to talk about bipartisanship and working together, so long as you do everything he wants you to do, that's his definition of bipartisanship. I am simply not going to continue to fund an entity that does the things I have seen on these videos. So you know Attorney General Lynch can investigate it. The bureau of investigations can investigate what I think, or possible criminal violations. But I am not gonna give taxpayer money to an entity that discusses the best way to sell body parts and whether or not you can perform procedures after a delivery, and then sell those parts in interstate commerce. I'm just not gonna fund it. Now, will my colleagues do it? We'll see this fall, but I'm not going to.BREAM: Or they are gonna quickly ask you, you are chairing the Benghazi committee investigating exactly what happened. Do you think any these new releases we got from the State Department today, the new round of Hillary Clinton e-mails? Some of them heavily redacted will have any impact or be of help to your committee?GOWDY: Probably not. You know, Shannon, we are in a constant battle with the state department over the production of documents. And you know, the self-described most transparent administration since the earth cooled loves to redact and they loved to withhold and they love to obstruct. But, we're gonna find out what happened before, during and after Benghazi with or without their help. And so far as without their help, we are marching on towards out October interview with the secretary, but we've got 40 other interviews planned for this fall too. It would go a lot better if the State Department showed just a little bit of interest in cooperating with the congressional investigations. And after all, there are four death Americans. So, put politics aside, just help us find out what happened to our four brave fellow Americans, but so far the state department has been incapable of doing that.BREAM: Yeah, they admitted today that they missed the deadline for some of their latest production. All right, Congressman Trey Gowdy, we appreciate your time. Have a great weekend.GOWDY: Yes, ma'am. Thank you. You too, thank you.BREAM: A shocking murder raising new questions about U.S. Immigration policy after this man accused of gunning down a couple who were acting as Good Samaritans. They pulled over to try to help him.Plus, new developments in the search for those teenage boys out missing at sea.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CAPTAIN MARK FEDOR, U.S. COAST GUARD: Hundreds of people searched thousands of miles because we were desperately committed to try to find Austin and Perry.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM: Breaking tonight, the coast guard sadly suspending its search, just hours ago for those two teenage boys who disappeared while boating off the coast of Florida, 14-year-old Perry Cohen and Austin Stephanos went missing at sea during a burst of severe weather last Friday. Searchers found their fishing boat this past Sunday, but no sign of the boys yet. The coast guard says, it is done all it can do. However, their families say a private hunt for the 14-year-olds will press on. They have enlisted the help of private pilots and boaters who are volunteering in assisting with the search.Also breaking tonight, new details on an 18-year-old legal immigrant from Mexico, accused of murdering a Good Samaritan couple and shooting and wounding their daughter. Trace Gallagher in the West Coast newsroom with the shocking story. Trace.GALLAGHER: Shannon, 18-year-old Jesus Deniz admitted in court today that he used a .22 caliber rifle to shoot three people who stopped to help him after he ran out of gas. When 52-year-old Jason Shane, his 50- year-old wife Tana and their 24-year-old daughter Jora, pulled off to the side of the road, offer assistance, the FBI said Deniz pulled out a rifle, told them to get out of the car and demanded money. When the family said they didn't have any, Deniz told them to walk away and then he opened fire. Killing the father and mother and wounding the daughter who was able to run for help. When he was asked why he shot the family? Deniz said he got tired of waiting around and he was mad because the daughter laughed at him. Deniz is from Mexico and is not a U.S. citizen, but because he's been in Montana for most of his life, the Obama administration deems him a legal permanent resident. Deniz was recently arrested for felony burglary but at the time, immigrations and customs enforcement said their hands were tied. Quoting here ""This individual does not have any criminal convictions, and as a permanent resident, is not currently removable. Thus, ICE detainer cannot be placed on him at this time."" If he is convicted of murder, ICE says he could then be removed from the country after he served his sentence, although, Deniz, could face the death penalty. The children of the murder victims were also in court today and just gave us a statement that reads in part, quoting, ""The aftermath of the whole situation has left seven children with no parents. Jesus Deniz has taken away with no remorse or thoughtfulness of life. Shannon.BREAM: All right, Trace. Thank you so much. Joining us now to talk about this, Kate Pavlich, news editor at Townhall.com and Leslie Marshall, progressive radio talk show host. Ladies, welcome to you both. I have to say just -- thinking about the kids and the daughter who witnessed this thing and got shot too. I mean, regardless of, you know, anything about this person, how the guy -- I mean, this is just devastating. And you know, Katie, this guy, I am told by sources, a senior -- Hill source, Capitol Hill. This guy came here illegally. He was here illegally, would've given a special juvenile visa -- immigration visa back in 2013. And so he was sort of grandfathered in and that's why he was here. But Katie, he hadn't committed a crime to that point, so you know, what's wrong with how this all proceeded?KATIE PAVLICH, TOWNHALL.COM NEWS EDITOR: Well, the first thing I want to point out is that the White House and open boarder activists often argue that they don't want to tear families apart by deporting their family members, even after they've committed crimes. But here we are with another case of an American family, whose family has been ripped apart permanently, as a result of bad illegal immigration policies. And when it comes to this guy and his criminal record, look, this is a direct result of the United States of America not enforcing, entering the country illegally as a crime. You know the authorities in this case say they couldn't deport him because of the circumstances and because he only had a burglary charge, instead of a conviction and of course, he had a pass from the Obama administration. But the fact is, entering the country illegal is -- illegally is a deportable offense. And so if we treated everyone equally under the law, we probably wouldn't be under this situation today.BREAM: And Leslie, obviously, you know over the last couple of years, that the administration has given prosecutors and immigration official's great prosecutorial discretion, I mean that's something that they have under the law. And it said you don't have to deport certain people, in fact, we are telling you not to waste your time on certain cases. You know, you don't really even have a right to deport. I mean ICE agents had sued the administration over those policies, but that's where we stand. Is this Leslie, what we end up with?LESLIE MARSHALL, PROGRESSIVE RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Well, what we have right now is approximately 2 million people under this administration that have been deported, 30,000 people every single day that are just sitting in detention centers. And you are right to point out Shannon, that this man didn't have a criminal record. And I think that all of us would agree that none of us, this administration, regardless of the ideology that any of the administration has a crystal ball and is clairvoyant. The majority -- overwhelming majority of more than 11 million illegal immigrants here are not violent criminals. This man was not a violent criminal. It's terrible with any tragedy like this happens, whether the person is a citizen or not. But this man, again, was not here illegally. And that special victim's juvenile status, those visas that are given, they're given to children who are abused or neglected from foreign countries. So this isn't, you know this isn't oh, just a free pass because you know you've been here a long time, he fit the criteria for this particular visa.BREAM: Well -- and Katie, my source though, on this says that DHS is essentially giving them out. They use the word, quote, ""Widely,"" the special immigration visas, that they are giving them out in a way that would suggests, there are a lot of people getting them.PAVLICH: Well, and this is the problem is they are giving them out without actually looking into the backgrounds of who these people are. And sure, Deniz maybe didn't have a violent criminal record, but he had a criminal record because he was in this country illegally and that is, in fact a crime. And let's not forget that the Obama administrations aren't -- is not only giving out these juvenile visas to people who they haven't vetted necessarily, but they are also releasing tens of thousands of violent criminals with convictions of homicide and rape on to the streets of America. And to say that, well, we don't have a crystal ball and we don't know what's gonna happen, why are we even allowing people who aren't allowed to be here in the first place, who have broken our laws as their first move inside the United States, to stay here at all.BREAM: Well -- and Leslie, we do know, as Katie pointed out, I mean, there's factual evidence to support that there have been people who have committed significant crimes that have been released, even though they are here illegally, back on the streets?MARSHALL: Well, there is no question that we have an immigration problem. And this is something the president has been saying, and that's why so many people, left and right, have been pushing for immigration reform. Which will includes securing our boarders more so, having more border patrol agents, having financing for that, better training, aerial drones. Things that they are doing as Rudy Giuliani had mentioned on the border in Columbia that's been very successful. But if we looked at, you know, what do we propose here? Are we supposed to deport every single person who was arrested? And this person -- remember, until he committed this crime had -- while have did have this visa and is under the current status, technically, here allowably, legally with this visa. And if you're saying prior, Katie, I hear you. I agree with you, you are breaking the law if you enter this country illegally, but we do not have the physical means, the financial means. It is not a reality that every single person that is in that.BREAM: OK.MARSHALL: Those detention centers are in this country now illegally can be deported. We all know that, that's not realistic.(CROSSTALK)PAVLICH: We put this people back on the streets.BREAM: We have to leave it there.PAVLICH: That is something we can't prevent.BREAM: We have to leave it there. But remember, as soon as he got the special visa, he then had legal permanent resident status and that really changes the game on a lot of things. Katie, Leslie, thank you both for this important debate tonight.MARSHALL: Thank you, Shannon.PAVLICH: Thank you, Shannon.BREAM: All right. An update in the search for that missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH 370, my source officials are saying that the debris washing up off the African coast is raising a whole lot of hopes of brand new clues.Plus, Cardinal Dolan slamming Donald Trump in a new op-ed. Father Jonathan Morris is here to weigh in.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM: Developing tonight, new hope for new clues in the search for missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH 370. Malaysia officials say they are almost certain that debris washing up off the African coast is from a Boeing 777, the same model airplane matching the missing Malaysian flight. The debris is being transported to France for analysis and that will determined whether these are parts are from MH 370. Investigators are also looking at battered luggage, also believed to have washed up in that's same area as the plane parts.A new reaction to Timothy Cardinal Dolan, stating op-ed about Donald Trump's controversial immigration remarks, Dolan declares that nativism is a movement he compares to the KKK is wearing its quote, ""Big haired head,"" suggesting Trump's comments about Mexicans who are a sad return to a terrible American tradition. Father Jonathan Morris is a Fox News contributor and author of Light in the Darkness, which we need a whole lot more of these days, Jonathan. Father, good to see you tonight.FATHER JONATHAN MORRIS, AUTHOR, ""LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS"": Thank you.BREAM: This that's going back and forth, what do you make of it? Because I know that, you know most catholic leaders want to stay out of politics, but he clearly felt a conviction to say something.MORRIS: We don't want our religious leaders to stay completely out of politics. Imagine if slavery were still in vogue today, would we want our religious leaders to say, oh no, that's politics. No, we want our religious leaders to speak out about moral issues, about human issues, but ethical issues. And right -- what I think Cardinal Dolan is saying here is that Trump, in this case said some really despicable things about Mexicans. Not that Trump is a bad person. Or not that we shouldn't control our border that there shouldn't? No, but you can't say, oh, the people who are coming over are rapists and murders and oh, by the way, I assume that some of them are good people. That is bigotry and despicable. I think what Cardinal Dolan is saying is, hey, we don't need that. We've done that in the past.BREAM: And of course, Trump will say this is being taken out of context, its being blown out of proportion. He said I'm doing great in pulling with the Hispanic, you know, voters. And you know he is trying to.(CROSSTALK)BREAM: Walked back.MORRIS: He says a lot of things, but.BREAM: He does say a lot of things.MORRIS: They've got -- they have piatas in Mexico.BREAM: Yeah.BREAM: That looks alike Trump, OK? So, I -- you know, I like to watch Donald Trump honestly. And he says things that are really true. Like, we need to control -- the situation right now on the border in the United States of America and the southern border is despicable. What was happening right now is we're saying, oh no, you can't come in, but watch this. We're going to let you come in and when you get in here, oh no, you can't get a job, but we're going to let you get a job. That is bad for immigrants and it's bad for the United States.BREAM: Right, before we're out of time. I want to make sure that people check out your new book. And they can get light in your lives and how to be a light to others.MORRIS: It's simply a practical way to say, here's a way to make a light in the darkness --that's the name of the book.BREAM: And it's a great one. We'll be right back.(LAUGHTER)MORRIS: Thank you.BREAM: We'll tweet out more information.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM: Twitter is burning up tonight, lot of you not happy about this federal judge blocking the release of more these undercover abortion provider videos. Well, go to facebook.com/TheKellyFile; tell us what you think of the show. Thanks for watching, I'm Shannon Bream. Megyn is back on Monday.
