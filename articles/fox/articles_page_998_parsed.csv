This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MEGYN KELLY, HOST, ""THE KELLY FILE"":  Breaking tonight, two huge stories unfolding as we watch both new fallout from last night's horrifying terror attack in France, and today an armed battle for power in the streets of Turkey.  One of our most important allies in the Middle East.  Welcome to a very busy night here on ""The Kelly File,"" everyone.  I'm Megyn Kelly, and all hell is breaking loose in Turkey right now.  Watch.  (GUNFIRE)Explosions and gunfire rocking the capital of Turkey where reports of a military coup starting breaking just a few hours ago.  The U.S. cares a lot about Turkey.  A lot.  Which has played a key role in our fight against ISIS.  Just look at where it's located.  Look at this map that I'm putting up for you.  Now, we're not sure who is in control at this hour, who is trying to take control, or how this is going to end.  We do know that Americans are being told to take shelter, to stay away from the embassies, and to stay off of the streets.  The Turkish military has more fire power than almost any other country in the region, much of it American-made.  And in moments, former CIA Director James Woolsey joins us on how high the stakes are here.  But first, there is breaking news on the attack in Nice, France, last night.  The heroes who brought it to an end and the heartbroken families who are still looking for missing loved ones.  The death toll has now risen to 84, including 10 children.  Stuffed animals, strollers, and a child's bike were among the items investigators were combing through along a crime scene that stretches for more than a mile.  More than 200 others were injured in the chaos.  One marked by noises and cries that one witness said they will never forget. But we are also learning about some of the heroes who emerged amid the horrors, like the person on a motorcycle who tried to cut off the driver of that track before attempting to enter the moving vehicle.  We're also learning that this attack might have continued were it not for another brave soul who reportedly jumped in front of the truck before the police were able to subdue the man inside.  But the stories of the would be heroes last night likely mean little to the families who lost their loved ones, like Sean and 11-year-old Brodie Copeland, a father and son from Texas who were on a family vacation and who are now being mourned by friends and loved ones a world  away.  Look at that.  Look at that.  We are also learning more about the man behind the attack, whose home has been raided and has reportedly his estranged wife has been taken into custody in the hours since his rampage along with the French Riviera. We've got an all-star line-up for you tonight.  Former FBI special agent Ali Soufan is here on what more we are learning about the Nice attacker.  Charles Krauthammer weighs in on the President's response today.  And then Brigitte Gabriel and two American Imams will wade into the firestorm over a suggestion from Newt Gingrich about deporting some American Muslims.  But we begin tonight with Bill Hemmer.  Co-anchor of America's Newsroom, who is live in Nice, France, with more on what we witnessed last night. Bill.  BILL HEMMER, CO-ANCHOR, ""AMERICA'S NEWSROOM"":  Megyn, good evening.  3:00 in the morning here.  Over my left shoulder, a small candlelight vigil here.  About a dozen or two people come by even at this late hour as the crowd starts to thin out here.  The one remarkable thing is how many come over here, and they sit or they stand, Megyn, in complete silence.  And that reflects what they're trying to understand on the inside.  They exchange hugs and often there are tears that run down their face.  This is another story that has hit this country yet again, trying to figure out why.  For more than a mile, a 31-year-old Tunisian who was raised here in East France, took an 18-ton truck and drove it at maximum speed, trying to hit as many people as possible along that treacherous, deadly route. And he was wildly successful at ripping the heart out of this country yet again.  But there are many questions tonight.  We're only 30 hours into this investigation.  There's been no claim of responsibility.  I think that's important so far because there was a claim in Paris back in November.  There was a claim at the Brussels airport back in March.  But so far, we have not been told of any.  The other thing is that there is no link for this killer to an Islamic radical group.  Maybe that changes.  Again, we're in the early stages of this.  But so far, no evidence has turned up. Throughout the country, though, you hear from the President Hollande, who has really -- he's become the face of this tragedy for a country for more than a year now.  He has issued a state of emergency that has now extended another three months.  He's put 10,000 soldiers in different parts of the country of France.  And on Saturday, when the sun comes up here in about four hours, they will begin three days of mourning throughout the country as well.  One thing that is significant about Hollande is that he talks about the terrorist as if he's going to take them out.  That has not happened.  And many are wondering tonight whether or not this is a country that can take on a challenge for a madman jumping in a truck that he rented, telling police he had ice cream in the back of the truck, getting past that security line, and doing the damage that he brought here.  How do you stop that?  That's the question they're asking in many parts of the world tonight -- Megyn.  KELLY:  Indeed.  Bill Hemmer, thank you, sir.  We are also learning more about the terrorist behind the attack in France. And just throughout the evening we're going to be popping up the situation in Turkey on the screen for you as well.  So you can keep your eye on this attempted coup there, and we'll get into why you should care.  But the terrorist in France last night, we now know, is a 31-year-old North African living in Nice.  And some terror experts say he fits what has now become a familiar profile.  Then today his ex-wife was taken into police custody, and we learned still more about him.  Trace Gallagher is live in our New York City Headquarters tonight with the very latest.  Trace.  TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And Megyn, we are learning a lot more about Mohamed Bouhlel, except for the motive, whether he was inspired by radical beliefs or whether he was depressed about his impending divorce.  But Bouhlel's family is now shining some light on the 31-year-old's killer's background.  His cousin telling the Daily Mail that he was, quote, ""a nasty piece of work and an unlikely jihadist,"" someone who didn't follow any of the basic rules of Islam.  The cousin claims Bouhlel drank alcohol, smoked, ate pork, took drugs, did not go to the mosque, didn't pray, and didn't observe Ramadan.  His relationship with his wife, the mother of his three children, had recently crumbled.  The two were in the midst of a divorce, and those who knew him say, he had a fierce temper.  Today on Shepard Smith reporting, I spoke with Daily Mail reporter Nick Fagge. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NICK FAGGE, DAILY MAIL REPORTER:  Well, we do know for a fact is that he repeatedly beat her and all the neighbors know what a violent, horrible man he was to her.  He was finally kicked out of the family home two years ago and moved to a smaller flat down the road.  (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER:  There is no indication so far that the killer's ex-wife knew about his plan, but she has been taken into custody both for questioning and for her own safety.  And we are also learning the Nice killer was having financial trouble as well.  He lost his job as a delivery driver after falling asleep at the wheel and crashing into four cars.  Neighbors say he was a strange man, always looking at them oddly, staring at their daughters.  And one neighbor even claims that after an argument recently, Bouhlel said to him, quote, ""One day you'll hear about me.""  Investigators are now combing through evidence in his small apartment and following up on leads that at one time suggested he may have had an accomplice -- Megyn.  KELLY:  Trace, thank you.  Joining us now with more, Ali Soufan who is a former FBI supervisory special agent who investigated the 9/11 terror attacks among many other terrorist attacks.  Ali, good to see you tonight.  ALI SOUFAN, FORMER FBI SUPERVISORY SPECIAL AGENT:  Good evening.  KELLY:  And so, I mean, you hear that quote from the cousin of the wife. He wasn't religious, didn't go to mosque, didn't pray, didn't observe Ramadan, drink alcohol, ate pork, took drugs.  He was not a Muslim, she says.  That's certainly how it sounds.  But what do you think?SOUFAN:  Well, you know, he fits the profile for many other people who joined ISIS and joined these extremist groups from France and from Belgium. Eighty percent of those who traveled, for example, from Belgium to Syria and Iraq to join extremist groups had criminal records, and they were not observant in any way, shape, or form.  Same thing in France.  So that fits the profile.  I mean I still remember the 9/11.  Some of the hijackers went to a stripper joint before they boarded the plane.  Muhammad Atta, the leader of the operation had a fight with a bartender on how many shots of vodka he had because he thought the bartender was charging him more money. So a lot of these guys --  KELLY:  But let me ask you, is that cover?  Because we've been told by other terror experts that some of these Islamic terrorists are told to lie, to adopt a more Americanized lifestyle, for example, over here, to act western so they're not suspicious, or is that a genuine rejection of some of the tenants of Islam, which certainly don't allow drinking and drugs and carousing by people who maybe have a foothold in Islam but aren't true believers?SOUFAN:  It might be for some people, it's a cover.  But also from my experience in dealing with a lot of these guys and interrogating many of them.  You know, religion is an afterthought usually.  It doesn't mean that they are not dangerous.  It doesn't mean that they are not lethal.  There are so many different reasons and incubating factors that feeds into the mentality of these individuals and help to radicalize them.  Now, to go back to this person in Nice, for example, Megyn, you know, we have to keep in mind that in 2010, ""Inspire"" magazine, which is an al Qaeda magazine for its branch, its affiliates in the Arabian Peninsula, the same magazine that taught the Boston bombers how to cook a bomb at home, it's the same magazine that, you know, advocated and promoted violence against the U.S. and our allies.  This magazine actually asked jihadist and asked supporters and sympathizers to use their vehicles to kill pedestrians and create damage.  KELLY:  Yes.  They laid it all out.  So clearly he was at least inspired by that sort of messaging.  But the question is, is this what ISIS looks like now?  Recruiting these disaffected, you know, I guess he was a Muslim, at least in name although perhaps not in practice according to the cousin of the wife.  But recruiting these disaffected young men into just killing, just kill in the name of Islam, kill in the name of ISIS, kill in whatever name you want, but here's how you do it and do it on our behalf.  SOUFAN:  And not even recruiting them, inspiring them as we saw in Orlando, for example.  The only thing a person have to do is just to say, I am ISIS before they die, and I pledge allegiance to al Baghdadi, to the caliph, and then ISIS is going to consider it as an ISIS operation even though they didn't lift a finger.  And yesterday, ISIS Twitter accounts and social media accounts were urging their supporters to wait because they don't have information about what's happening in France.  So that's something that we have to keep in mind, too, but ISIS now is not a physical terrorist group.  It's morphed into a narrative, an ideology, a brand, and a lot of these people who are disenfranchised, crazy, they just do what ISIS want them to do, and then it's an ISIS operation.  KELLY:  Ali, thank you.  I just want to bring our viewers up to date on what we're seeing here on screen right.  And you can see the anger in the streets of Turkey tonight, where there has been an attempted coup.  We have breaking news out of Turkey right now.  We want to get back now to that.  We just got video of military forces facing off with a group of what appears to be supporters of the Turkish president, President Erdogan.  In the last couple of hours, we've seen soldiers in the streets.  We've seen huge crowds of Turks marching and chanting and reports of explosions and gunfire.  Wait, let's just listen here.  You can hear some of the anger.  Particularly we've seen these incidents happening about around the Turkish parliament and government buildings. Now in moments we're going to be joined by the former CIA Director James Woolsey.But first we go to Fatih Artun.  He's a reporter for our sister network Sky News, and he joins us on the phone from the heart of Istanbul.  Thank you so much, Fatih, for being here with us.  Tell us what you're seeing tonight in the streets.  FATIH ARTUN, SKY ARABIA REPORTER (on the phone):  Actually, maybe you can hear right now Turkish military -- are flying over Istanbul right now. Actually one of them just passed really, I mean, close to us, and they are circling around the airport right now.  Actually, what we're hearing now, (INAUDIBLE) Ankara or neighborhood from Istanbul, there is a military attempt, but it's not clear who is doing or which part he is supporting because some (INAUDIBLE), they don't support.  Also Turkish intelligence, I mean, head of media, Department of Turkish intelligence said that Turkish army general was -- but they saved him and now he is on his duty.  Actually in Turkish history, we faced a few military coup, but no one happened like that because Turkish helicopter, Turkish jet fighters are hitting their country, hitting their parliament.  It didn't happen in Turkish history before.  I mean it's really -- they are now facing -- it's all 9/11 right now.  KELLY:  Oh, wow.  Wow.  That's a stark way of putting it.  Thank you very much.  I want to stand you by because we want to get to James Woolsey.  Just to put this in perspective for folks, he's a former CIA director.  JAMES WOOLSEY, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR:  Thank you very much, sir, for being here tonight.  Let's just -- with all due respect to the former CIA director, let's just take the pictures from Turkey live full screen so the viewers can see what's going on.  So just assume that people don't know anything about Turkey, okay?  We know where it's located on the map.  We know it's a neighbor to Syria and Iraq which we care about.  We know it's a NATO ally.  Why should we care about what's happening with this coup, this attempted coup over President Erdogan?Well, Turkey is very much the linchpin of that part of the world.  It has a sophisticated labor force and a solid economy compared to a lot of the other places in the Middle East.  It went through a huge transition in the aftermath of World War I with Ataturk moving toward a secular state.  For many years, a number of us, me and both intelligence and arms control negotiations have worked with the Turks and have found them extremely helpful, useful, clever, wonderful allies.  And a lot of us would like to have it that way again.  It was certainly not headed -- our relationship with Turkey was certainly not headed in that direction over the course of the last few years as Erdogan has imprisoned journalists and taken a number of other heavy -- very heavy-handed steps.  KELLY:  So this guy -- just to set the scene.  So, Erdogan gets elected and becomes more and more Islamist and more and more authoritarian.  And what we've seen over the past few years is, he's called birth control treason, insisted all mothers have four children.  He wants to ban alcohol, public kissing.  Other signs of secularism.  He's jailed hundreds of journalists, university professors.  Thousands of people have been charged with the crime of insulting him.  That's a crime there, if you insult Erdogan personally.  So this is our supposed ally.  The Obama administration is backing him tonight, and yet what we're being told, although it's unclear -- you tell me -- is that this attempted coup, the military has, you know, for years said, you're getting, you know, you're getting too far afield.  Let's pull it back.  Let's be more secularized.  If you try to go too Islamist, we'll pull you back.  And yet the reports tonight are maybe that's what's happening or maybe -- maybe it's some other group?  Is that what we're worried about?  Because you tell me why the Obama administration would not be backing a coup like this.  WOOLSEY:  Well, this part of the world is the home of many conspiracy theories and I'll pass one on to you that has come to me today from a friend in Turkey.  And he says there are a number of people who believe this, which is that the coup was so clumsy and so ineffective and so badly pulled together, that it may have been at least in part a fake and something that was organized by the Erdogan government in order to be cracked down on.  Now, I don't know that that's true.  I floated it because it seemed interesting, and there are apparently a number of people in Turkey who believe that.  But whether it was something like that or more likely just a badly organized coup that was not well-coordinated and that failed, we have a situation where it looks like the people who would more or less be regarded as reformers are likely to lose.  KELLY:  All right.  If I can just stand you by, Director Woolsey, because this is President Erdogan right here.  He's landed in Istanbul.  His plane was circling reportedly with no place to land, looking for asylum was an initial report.  I think we may have the English translation.  Let's listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Those are unconfirmed reports.  President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also has been speaking in the last few moments.  We'll be having more through the morning here on Sky News.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  All right.  We're trying to figure out what he said and what -- 150 injured.  Okay.  That's the latest reporting.  And back to you, Director Woolsey.  So, you think this may not actually be the military staging a coup as we've seen them do in the past.  This may be a group of fakers.  This may be Erdogan messing with himself in other words, his own government?  Because what the experts are saying is the worst possible outcome is more instability in Turkey.  WOOLSEY:  I think the chances that that was a fake are well under 50/50, but they may not be zero.  It's hard to understand why they went forward with something as clumsy and likely to fail as this.  KELLY:  And so what are we looking for tonight?  Because, you know, are Americans more in jeopardy, in other words?  If President Erdogan stays, then, you know, tomorrow are we in the same position we were in yesterday with respect to Turkey?WOOLSEY:  I think we may be in a somewhat less good situation even than we were yesterday.  I think the tensions between his government and us are likely to increase.  I think it could be a very unpleasant coming months in American-Turkish relations.  I wish it were different.  I love working with the Turks.  KELLY:  Wow.  Instability.  More instability in the Middle East is not what anybody is looking for.  WOOLSEY:  No.  KELLY:  And yet, nor is more extremism.  Great to see you, James Woolsey.  Thank you, sir.  WOOLSEY:  Good to see you.  KELLY:  While we keep an eye on this coup or attempted coup unfolding in Turkey tonight, we're also getting new reaction to President Obama's response on the French terror attack we saw last night.  And Charles Krauthammer joins us next on that.  Plus, Newt Gingrich touched off a firestorm yesterday with suggestions that we may need to deport some American Muslims from this country.  See what he's saying tonight when we come back.  Stay tuned.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  We should frankly test every person from here who is of a Muslim background and if they believe in Sharia, they should be deported.  (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're going to win this fight by building, by never giving up on diplomacy to end the Syrian civil war, by working with partners around the world, including Muslim communities, to push back against hateful ideologies that twist and distort Islam.  And we will win this fight by staying true to our values, values of pluralism and rule of law and diversity and freedoms like the freedom of religion, freedom of speech and assembly.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  That was President Obama speaking earlier today on the terror attack in Nice, France, that killed at least 84 people.  He said we would win this fight by never giving up on diplomacy and went on to stress that Islam is a religion of peace.  But many of the President's critics were hoping for something stronger.  Case in point, 1986, Libyan terrorists bombed a West Berlin nightclub hoping to kill off-duty American servicemen.  The explosion took the lives of three people, including two U.S. soldiers and wounded hundreds of others.  Within days, President Reagan had launched a military response that was not without controversy and said this to the nation.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RONALD REAGAN, 40TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We Americans are slow to anger.  We always seek peaceful avenues before resorting to the use of force, and we did.  We tried quiet diplomacy, public condemnation, economic sanctions, and demonstrations of military force.  None succeeded.  Despite our repeated warnings, Gaddafi continued his reckless policy of intimidation, his relentless pursuit of terror.  He counted on America to be passive.  He counted wrong.  I warned that there should be no place on earth where terrorists can rest and train and practice their deadly skills.  I meant it.  I said that we would act with others if possible and alone if necessary to ensure that terrorists have no sanctuary anywhere.  Tonight we have.  (END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY:  Joining me now, Charles Krauthammer, syndicated columnist and Fox News contributor.  Charles, good to see you.  Those Reagan remarks just make you feel something.  They make you feel among other things that he got it.  He got it.  Your thoughts.  CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Obama's rhetoric was completely wrong, repeating everything he's been saying for seven and a half years, which has yielded us the worst outbreak the terrorism that we have seen the last 12 months.  All over the globe, mass murders on a large scale and quickening in pace.  So his turning to diplomacy is almost pathetic because he doesn't seem to be able to articulate any other answer.  KELLY:  At this point, Americans want to know what it's going to take to win.  I mean, the resolve to defeat this group is growing by the day.  KRAUTHAMMER:  Well, he's tried diplomacy.  People don't even remember now when they called for a big summit of world leaders to go after this.  Kerry called a huge summit right after the earlier ISIS attacks, the earlier ISIS -- the cold-blooded executions on video and on the internet.  When it was, you know, a large number of countries.  Obama boasted of a 61-member coalition, which is pathetic.  Where are these people?  Essentially the U.S. Air Force, a couple of other allies, and of course the Iraqi army and militias on the ground and the Kurds, of course.  But the idea that our diplomacy is solving this has simply been shown to be false.  What needs to be done, everybody understands, ISIS has alienated every country in the region, alienated people around the world, and it can be taken out.  It is not ten feet tall. The Washington Post had a lead story earlier in the week talking about the fact that ISIS is quietly preparing its own people for the fall of the caliphate, what's happening on the ground right now in Mosul is the next target, and ultimately it will be Raqqa.  They are now metastasizing to live, to strike, to execute their plans elsewhere.  But they are being squeezed in their homeland, and that, to me, is the key.  That's the way to win this.  You have to make them homeless.  You have to remove the sanctuary.  You have to remove their income.  Ultimately they then have to go underground.  Yes, they will continue to strike, but they will be nowhere near the threat they are now.  It hinges on what happens on the ground in the region, and you don't execute that by diplomacy.  KELLY:  Charles, what do you make of what's happening in Turkey tonight?KRAUTHAMMER:  Well, the reports are conflicting.  The military clearly has seen itself for a hundred years as a defender of secularism, and they have a president who has been relentlessly pushing Turkey into a dictatorship. He's been suspending judges, imprisoning journalists, taking over all the institutions and islamistizing (ph) the country, one that is famously secular in the Muslim world.  And they have done this before.  They've had a coup almost every decade.  Whenever the elected government would move Islamist, they would strike.  Now, if they succeed, I think ultimately it would be to our benefit because the Turkish military, the secular arm of Turkey, is a very strong ally of the west, very anti-Islamist, will join us with a lot more vigor in the fight against ISIS and terrorism.If Erdogan wins, I suspect he'll be strengthened. He will accelerate the Islamistization, and he has been playing a double game with ISIS, allowing infiltration into ISIS territory, allowing the fighters to go in and out, and also allowing the refugees to pour into Europe. So his game is he's not an enemy. He's been warming up slightly, allowing us to do air strikes out of Turkey. But this could change. He could be embittered. He could be radicalized, and that would be a terrible outcome.KELLY: Charles Krauthammer, thank you so much. Good to see you.KRAUTHAMMER: My pleasure.KELLY:  Well, ISIS affiliated groups are promising that the violence we saw in Nice, France, is likely to continue across the globe. And Newt Gingrich is taking some heat tonight for suggesting that American-Muslims who subscribe to Sharia law should actually be deported. Here's what Gingrich told Sean Hannity last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GINGRICH: Western civilization is in a war. We should frankly test every person here who is of a Muslim background, and if they believe in Sharia, they should be deported. Sharia is incompatible with western civilization.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Azam Akram is imam of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community in Chicago. Bridgette Gabriel a New York Times best-selling author and president of Act for America and Sheikh Ahmad Salman is imam of Darus Saalam mosque in San Francisco. Thank you all so much for being here. Ahmad, let me start with you on this and your thoughts on Newt's proposal to potentially deport American-Muslims who follow Sharia law.IMAM AZAM AKRAM, AHMADIYYA MUSLIM COMMUNITY: First of all, thank you Megyn for having us on.SHEIKH AHMAD SALMAN, IMAM OF DARUS SALAAM MOSQUE: To begin with Kelly...KELLY: That's for Ahmad, sorry.SALMAN: To begin with, Kelly, I think Newt Gingrich does not know anything about Sharia. Before he understands Sharia, if we talk about Sharia, it stands totally on the basis of justice. What we see in the United States as a constitution, it is on the basis of justice and the holy Quran teaches that we have to obey by the law of the land. So this is what Sharia is. Now, in order for Gingrich to know more about this, he can come to my mosque in Darus Salaam mosque, house of peace, where we can talk more about Sharia on that matter.KELLY: Bridgette, what about -- I mean, I don't know if it's Sharia, but Islamism is, you know, considered problematic by many Americans because if you are an Islamist, you approach Islam very different from modern, more reformed Muslims.BRIDGETTE GABRIEL, ACT FOR AMERICA PRESIDENT: Exactly. You are correct. Islamists are very different than the imams that we are having here right now, who belong actually to the Ahmadiyya movement. The Ahmadiyya movement started in the 19th century and they actually believe in angels. Those sets of imams and mosques are not the ones we are talking about. They have reformed their religion.What we are talking about is the authentic Sharia practice that the majority of Muslims around the world practice, the 1.6 billion Muslims who follow Sharia and it's not compatible with our constitution and this is what ISIS follows, and that's what causing mayhem around the world right now. That's what I'm worried about.KELLY: How is it not compatible, Bridgette?GABRIEL: It's not compatible with our constitution. They believe (inaudible) should be killed. They believe a woman's value is half of that of a man. They believe if a woman is raped, she needs four witnesses in order for her to be saved, to testify against the rape. They believe in supremacy. They believe Islam is supreme to all other religions.They do not believe in manmade laws such as the constitution. That's just the tip of the iceberg, and that's why Sharia law is not compatible with the United States constitution.KELLY: Assam, this is not -- Andy McCarthy, a well-respected attorney and former federal prosecutor who prosecuted terrorists, he's made this point several times, that we need to be distinguishing between Islamism and Islam for the very reasons that Bridgette just outlined. Is she wrong? Is he wrong?AKRAM: Well, the crux of the matter is that it's failed Muslim leadership. And as part of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, we have the consistent leadership of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who is the founder of the community over 120 years ago, and now his successor who is the Khalifa of Islam, Mirza Masroor Ahmad, has over 4,000 imams under him promoting the same message.So, when you look at the world today, the Muslim world is calling for that leadership, that guidance. And just like a body without a head, you have no sense of direction. And this is why all over the countries and all over the world, in over 206 different nations, we have been promoting the peaceful message of Islam, the justice.KELLY: That's your group. Bridgette already conceded that. That's a different question about those who believe the things that Bridgette just outlined. I need to stand you by. We've got breaking news in Turkey. I'm coming back to you in a minute. We've got late breaking details on this attempted coup and we're going to go back to Trace Gallagher to get us up to speed. Trace?TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And I want to show you Megyn. We just, a few minutes ago showed you that Turkish president Erdogan was actually holding a news conference there. We couldn't understand what he was saying because there was no translation. Now we're getting a better idea of what he was telling his followers.Just for some background, you should know that president Erdogan was actually out of town vacationing at the Black Sea when this attempted coup happened. And then about 35 minutes ago, he flew into Ataturk airport -- that's the main airport in Istanbul -- the same one that was attacked just a couple of weeks ago, and he was greeted by, we're told, hundreds of his supporters. And then he was escorted to a television station where you saw that news conference. And now we hear that he is saying things like those responsible will pay the appropriate price.He went on to say this was carried out by a minority number of people who cannot stomach the unity of the country. The president went on to say millions are now in the streets of Turkey protesting the uprising and that the cabinet is functioning as usual, and they are in the process now, Megyn, he says of arresting police who were involved with this attempted coup. What's fascinating about this is that earlier, those who attempted the coup took over the main television station in Istanbul and they sent out a message saying they had control of the country.Well, now that has flipped. That is back in control of the government. So clearly, they no longer have control of the television station and it has been several hours, maybe three hours since we have heard from the opposition, those who attempted the coup. And that is a sign some say, that this may have been a failed coup. Very early, still getting conflicting messages coming in, Megyn. We'll keep you up to speed with what's coming across the wire.KELLY: All right, Trace, thank you. I want to bring back Bridgette Gabriel because she actually has some expertise on Turkey. And Bridgette, all right, so this -- you tell me, is this good or not? Because our government, our president, Hillary Clinton has put out a statement saying they're against the coup.They stand behind the democratically elected leader. And yet what the other experts are saying is if Erdogan survives an attempted coup, he's only going to get more extreme in his Islamism, and that's not good for Turkey, and that's not good for the United States. Your thoughts?GABRIEL: That's not good for Turkey, the United States, or the Middle East. If Erdogan wins and comes back to power, it is very, very bad. Actually, it's a win for ISIS and it's a loss for the civilized world. We need the coup to succeed because that will be our way to actually be able to defeat ISIS and basically bring some stability to the Middle East. Erdogan is the one who said Islam is Islam.There's no moderate Islam. There's no radical Islam. Islam is one, and that is Islam. He's very radical. He actually has been bringing Turkey to a cliff -- this is why you see the divided Turkey. Turkey is basically under Erodgan is heading towards in Islamic theocracy. He's running it like a dictatorship. It will be another mini Iran if he comes to power. We hope and pray that the coup will succeed.KELY: In Turkey, if you investigate or question his anti-terror policies, you can get investigated by his government. You can come under scrutiny. You can potentially be thrown in jail for questioning him, for insulting him. And you know, this is somebody who our government right now is saying, leave him alone.GABRIEL: Exactly. This is the same government that actually had dragged the world for the last eight years into destruction, under President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and under this current administration. Libya is in shambles. Syria is in shambles. Iraq is in shambles. They do not know what they're doing.They are bringing the world into the brink of war, and the fact that they came out in support of Erdogan is just mind-boggling. The American public needs to wake up and realize that what our administration is doing right now is leading the world into war. We cannot support Erdogan and we can just hope that the coup will succeed and Erdogan will be out of power.KELLY: On the flip side, we've seen many, you know, new dictators or actual dictators deposed in the Middle East over the past seven to eight years and it has not always worked out despite great hopes on our part. It has not always worked out. Bridgette, thank you. Back to you in just a bit and back to this breaking news in Turkey.But first we want to get to what's happening in Nice, France because up next, we've got the former assistant FBI Director James Kallstrom. He's with us tonight. He called us last night as we watched what was happening in Nice and has some strong thoughts on the terror threats facing the globe. He's up next.Plus as the craziness in Turkey plays out, Colonel Tony Schaffer will speak about what this means for U.S. forces in the Middle East. We have a key NATO base in Turkey and we have an update on the Americans there in a moment. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Breaking tonight, new followup (ph) from media coverage of the terror attack in Nice, France. Hours after the French president and president Obama said that all signs pointed to terrorism, ""The New York Times"" omitting that fact from its front-page headline instead writing, ""Truck Attack on French Crowd."" Compare that to the front page of the British Daily Telegraph.That newspaper listing in bold, blood splattered font the death toll from a wave of recent terror attacks starting with Nice, including Orlando, San Bernardino, California as well in the U.S. James Kallstrom is former FBI assistant director in charge. He's with me now. Jim, wow, the Daily Telegraph, I mean, that says it all. Just put that back on the screen. Your thoughts?JAMES KALLSTROM, FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: You know, Megyn, the mainstream media is a fifth column in this country. They might as well just all, just join the Democratic Party. They're a mouth piece for them. You know, they would make pride -- jealous of what they did into this country by not reporting the facts and what they don't say. I mean, it's just unbelievable.KELLY: You've been talking for some -- yeah, go ahead.KALLSTROM: No. I've been thinking about this thing in France, Megyn. I mean, you and I have been talking about this for, what, a long time, a couple of years maybe. You know, we have one of these outrageous events, and then we talk about what needs to be done and really nothing ever happens, you know. And we need to -- we need to, you know, bring this thing up to a much higher level. You know, I think we need -- the Congress needs to declare war on radical Islam.They need to do that right away. It needs to happen. We need to discredit the ideology. Folks have been talking about that today. We do that two ways. We kill them and we get the other Muslims that aren't radical to stand up and talk about, you know, what this ideology is doing to their religion. I don't see that happening in the United States until we have a new administration because they're not going to want to go to the -- you know, the weakness that's in there.You know, the FBI is operating -- we've talked about this under this heavy, heavy burden of political correctness, this heavy blanket. They've got one and a half or maybe one and three quarters arms tied behind their back. Why do you think we had that situation in Boston with the Russians? Why do you think we had all these cases that seemed to drop through the cracks? Well, the reason is this P.C., this...KELLY: Yes, the terrorist down in Orlando.KALLSTROM: Absolutely. Because you know, the rules of engagement are ludicrous. You know, the FBI can't do things that normal citizens can do. It's outrageous, you know, and you don't hear about that. Jim Comey needs to stand up and talk about that. And, you know, it's just unbelievable. And of course they don't have the manpower to do the job either, you know.  And I think Comey really needs to get up to Congress.You know, he needs to put his big-boy pants on, go up there, talk to the Intelligence Committees, talk to about the Oversight Committees and tell them the truth about what the FBI really needs to protect this society. I think the attorney general should -- I think the attorney general should...KELLY: I know you said in the past about the FBI, that you feel that they've been put in a straitjacket, that they're wearing a heavy straitjacket right now and Comey and our leaders need to take it off.KALLSTROM: Yeah, I don't know if any of them will admit it, but I'll tell you right now that's how the agents feel. You know, he could get some of his credibility back if he actually spoke the truth about that. The attorney general, I think, should resign. You know, in March, Megyn, she directed the FBI to consider bringing certain climate change denials (ph) up on RICO charges. I mean can you believe that, that she would ask the FBI to look into charging...KELLY: Well, they said they consider climate change one of the gravest threats facing the nation and they won't name radical Islam. This is an argument we've heard time and time again. But you know what the response to that is Jim but they don't think naming it does any good. You look at this guy that we saw last night in nice -- and by the way we are watching this situation in Turkey and this attempted coup, that's why we have that on the screen.But the guy in Nice, you know, he's eating pork and drinking beer and getting a divorce and didn't go to mosque, and people are saying, well, that's -- I don't know what that is. It doesn't sound like any form of, Islam, so why should we be saying radical Islam? Why shouldn't we just be saying radical killer?KALLSTROM: For the attorney general of the United States, the chief law enforcement officer, to talk about bringing people up on RICO charges for expressing their first amendment rights, she did the same thing with the people that talked badly about Muslims. I mean, it's just unbelievable and you know, I don't know.I don't know where that all ends. And of course the meeting with Clinton on the tarmac, I mean those three things, I think -- she should do the country a favor and think about resigning. And, of course, Sharia law is -- are we done?KELLY: Yes. I'm sorry. I've got to go, but I'll give you your final thought. Why don't you take the last word, and then we'll wrap it.KALLSTROM: Sharia law is not consistent. Anybody that comes in here from nations that practice Sharia law should go through some sort of a Sharia test, and if they're Sharia-type people and they want to practice that, they should be turned around to head back where they came from.KELLY: Jim, thank you for being here.KALLSTROM: Thank you.KELLY: What are your (ph) reactions tonight, from the Republican National Convention site in Cleveland, Ohio, it all goes down next week. And you may have heard there was some big news today that on any other night would have been the lead of every broadcast in America. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump announced a running mate today, Governor Mike Pence of Indiana.And that pick is already raising some questions. Joining me live from Cleveland, our Fox News digital politics editor Chris Stirewalt. Stirewalt, great to see you. So, what do you think of the pick?CHRIS STIREWALT, DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, we talked before about the liabilities of the pick, but it is what it is. The question at this point becomes the theater, the staging of how the pick goes and can they as a ticket get along? Can they work together? And while Pence certainly buoys up Trump on some issues with the Republican base, there is some question about how the two of them are going to work as a team.KELLY: What was up with the weird -- I'm announcing him on Friday morning -- wait, I'm not announcing him on Friday morning because we had a terror attack in Nice. Oh, but wait, I'm going to make other announcements, and then I'm going to announce it via twitter and like -- there he is and here's our logo.STIREWALT: Yeah. Well, the logo was not exactly a smash hit, but the Trump campaign vehemently denied any wish on the part of the presidential nominee to ditch Pence at the last minute. But one could understand why he would have wanted to given the fact that the leaks came out of Indianapolis and blew the story that Trump was getting ready for the big reveal and there was a feeling that maybe Pence was trying to jam Trump and prevent him from switching at the end.But reports from other outlets were either Trump was looking even late into the night to try to find a way to ditch Pence. And then today, Pence is the guy, but he doesn't get the ceremony. And then tomorrow, they take it to Chris Christie's home state, I guess to rub his nose in it, but take it to his home state to say Pence is the guy, announce it in New Jersey.KELLY: Oh well. It's like an arranged marriage that is getting off to a rocky start. Chris, stand by because our friends at ""The Five"" are already making their way to you at the Republican National Convention. Oh, my lord, would you look at this? Would you look at this? They boarded a bus to Cleveland. Now they're in Hershey, Pennsylvania, which is so unfair.Why can't I be there with you? Never mind, I don't want that. And they're giving us a live look at night one of their two-week road trip. So, all right, Gutfeld, I'll start with you. How is it going so far?GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS THE FIVE SHOW CO-HOST: Well, there are a couple of problems whenever you do a road trip. One is the smell. I stink, which is why I have Febreze to go. And then whenever I'm hungry, I just have Easy Cheese. You just squirt the cheddar into your mouth. It's beautiful.KELLY: All right. Dana, what do you think? I mean, let's take -- I'm not sure about your quilted seat there, Dana. I think I would have sat next to Kimberly.DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS THE FIVE SHOW CO-HOST: Everybody wants to sit next to Kimberly. We've been rotating every 15 minutes, somebody gets to stretch out. I'm sitting so I can oversee everything. I'm in charge of educational games for the road trip. So far, so good. We've learned a lot. We've learned a lot.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, FOX NEWS THE FIVE SHOW CO-HOST: Exactly.KELLY: Another round of Scrabble. May I recommend to you Family Feud 2, you can download it right now on your app, and it's a great family game. Eric Bolling, in between your bus trip and your Cleveland responsibilities --ERIC BOLLING, FOX NEWS THE FIVE SHOW CO-HOST: Any show, any show, you name it.KELLY: Well, this is the part of the show that is Eric's book tease, so everybody else needs to be quiet. Eric has written a book called ""Wake Up, America."" Wake up.BOLLING: Did you see what I did? I dropped it off next to Dana.KELLY: How does this relate to your bus tour? How does this relate to your bus tour, Eric?GUTFELD: That's what bus tours are for.BOLLING: The bus tour, right. You know, it's a book tour bus tour -- no, it's not. Look at this.PERINO: We have shot glasses, too.BOLLING: Shot glasses for the book.PERINO: They're for water.BOLLING: Red Bull.GUTFELD: This is a normal glass for me.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, that's actually a full size cup for you.JUAN WILLIAMS: You know, Megyn, what we've been doing on this bus, we've been watching you.KELLY: Why? What do you think of the show tonight?WILLIAMS: We've been watching you because there's a giant TV on this fabulous bus.GUILFOYLE: Yeah, it's pretty -- very good. It's really cool. We have nice sight (ph) setup. It's like having our own little cozy kind of, what, like a little den or something. We're all living together.PERINO: Plus we love to watch Charles Krauthammer. We watched him on your show.KELLY:  So what do you think -- Kimberly, are you like -- what are the sleeping arrangements? This is what I want to know, Kimberly. And what's the deal with the bathroom? Is there a bathroom on the bus?GUILFOYLE: Yes, there is one bathroom, only for one. So that's going well so far actually, and because we're going to arrive at least at our first stop in about 15 minutes, we should be safe. So it's going very well. We're excited about that. We've got ""Fox & Friends"" tomorrow. We're also going to go to Hershey Park. We're going to go to the zoo.KELLY: OK, we'll be watching. I want a full update on Hershey, Pennsylvania. We'll miss you guys and we'll watch you. Road trip by ""The Five."" We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: And we, at ""The Kelly File,"" will be live in Cleveland next week for the Republican National Convention as well. We'll be joined by some special guests as Donald Trump is expected to be officially named the 2016 GOP nominee. We'll be taking a plane. Two bathrooms, better.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HOWARD KURTZ, HOST: On the ""Buzz Meter"" this Sunday, the Republican contest heads straight into the gutter first by degenerating into a war over the wives with Donald Trump angry about a nude picture of his wife making a twitter threat to expose Ted Cruz's wife and the Senator lashing out.SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't get angry often. But you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids that will do it every time. Donald, you're a snivelling coward and leave Heidi the hell alone.KURTZ: And Cruz is also denouncing a ""National Enquirer"" story as garbage. Are the media wallowing in this sleazy stuff? The presidential campaign is rock by the bombs in Belgium shifting the focus to tough terror talk and finger pointing.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Donald Trump and Barack Obama have to understand one thing, that America does lead the world.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is extraordinary you have a -- the leading candidate in the Republican side saying torture first ask questions later.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now, I've been saying for years that President Obama strategy of containing ISIS is dangerous and puts the entire world at risk. And Hillary Clinton, the architect of the Libya mess doesn't seem to have a strategy either.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You look at Ted Cruz talking about Orwellian presences in American neighborhoods where Muslims live it's the exact opposite thing we're supposed to do.KURTZ: Is the press turning the tragedy into another ideological blame game? Plus, millions more in damages against Gawker for posting that sex tape of Hulk Hogan who slammed his adversary to the mob.HULK HOGAN, AMERICAN PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER: I will be naked forever, you know, until my children's, children's children die because of the internet.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: We'll talk about the impact on journalistic freedom with a Fox reporter who just interviewed Hulk. I'm Howard Kurtz and this is ""MediaBuzz.""Melania Trump made an unwanted appearance in the campaign when the tiny anti-Trump pact make America awesome posted this on Facebook, a nude image from her modelling days warning that this could be America's next first lady unless people vote for Ted Cruz.Trump responded with this tweet which we quickly deleted then restored after others found it. Wow, Senator Ted Cruz that is some low level ad you did using a picture of Melania in a GQ shoot. Be careful or I will spill the beans on your wife.A text that Senator responded on tweeter at first saying Trump was being classless and would be a coward to attack his wife, Heidi and both of them responded to reporters.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You probably know by now that most of the things that Donald Trump says have no basis in reality.CRUZ: I don't get angry often. But you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids that will do it every time. Donald, you're a snivelling coward and leave Heidi the hell alone.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: And then there were the unproven allegations in the National Enquirer which we'll get to in a moment. Joining us now and analyze the coverage this increasingly slimy campaign Gayle Trotter, a commentator who writes for The Daily Caller and The Hill; Ashley Parker, who covers Donald Trump for The New York Times and Julie Roginsky, a Fox News Contributor and a Co-Host of ""Outnumbered.""Ashley, ordinarily I would say, wow, this is really lowering stuff. But with the two frontrunners slamming each other, how can journalists resist?ASHLEY PARKER, NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER: Yes, exactly. I mean it became part of the discussion and they're going back-and-forth and I think it is a little salacious and a little fun. But it also sort of speaks...KURTZ: You admit that it's fun?PARKER: I admit that it's fun, not socially good for democracy but fun...KURTZ: Yes.(LAUGHTER)PARKER: ...and, you know, and it also sort of speaks to as Senator Cruz made a point that speaks to character and what voters are looking for and I was at a focus group in St. Louis a Republican base voters and among those who didn't love Donald Trump, one of the things they mentioned was it is wasn't substantive. It was stylistic. And this one of these things that helps voters make that stylistic impression of this is someone we want in the oval office or not.KURTZ: So, Gayle which is the more important story among these competing teams for the press? Trump's bringing to the defense of his wife, blaming Cruz for $300 ad by the small independent pact that has nothing to do with the Cruz campaign or Cruz with a sound bite that we've seen 10,000 times calling Donald a snivelling coward in front of the cameras?GAYLE TROTTER, THE DAILY CALLER CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I disagree with Ashley. I say this coverage is not fun and that it demonstrates asymmetrical warfare by Donald Trump. And you have those things that the media can be reporting on those three things -- those three different things...KURTZ: So you're embarrassed by the coverage I would say?TROTTER: I would say I'm just heartened by the coverage. And the media is treating this as a he said, he said. It's creating a false equivalence because Donald Trump does what no other candidates are willing to do. And he goes places that no other candidates are willing to go. And so in this case, the media covering it, like Cruz is doing the same thing as Trump is doing, when Cruz complimented Donald Trump's wife and as you noted, Donald Trump retweeted an insulting tweet -- picture of Heidi Cruz and made a commentary as well.KURTZ: The side-by-law-side picture of Heidi Cruz...TROTTER: Yes.KURTZ: ...and Melania Trump. Julie, Trump said he might have to spill the beans on Heidi Cruz and there was speculation that this might have to do with period -- a decade ago when she was going through depression and strain in her marriage. That's been reported by ""The New York Times"" and others, so what did you make of that particular tactic?JULIE ROGINSKY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, CO-HOST OF ""OUTNUMBERED: I mean, the tactic that Donald Trump once again is going in the gutter I think Gayle is actually right about the fact that this is not symmetrical. The media hasn't covering it symmetrically. The reality is that Ted Cruz had nothing to do with this ad but this pact did nothing more than put out a picture that Melania Trump posed for. It's not even from a picture of her...KURTZ: Yes.ROGINSKY: ...some naked picture like a Hulk Hogan situation that got hacked.KURTZ: Yes. It's been on the internet.ROGINSKY: It's been on the internet...(CROSSTALK)ROGINSKY: ...Donald trump himself seemed very proud of it.KURTZ: Right.ROGINSKY: He has a beautiful wife. She has ever the right to pose wherever she wants. Conversely, you've got Donald Trump, instead of coming out and saying, listen I'm proud of my wife. She's a beautiful woman. This is what she did in her career. I'm very proud of the fact that she made the cover of GQ proceed to go and attacked Heidi Cruz who is an innocent bystander in all of this. It reminds me when Osama Bin Laden attack with 9/11 and we went to Iraq (INAUDIBLE) nothing...TROTTER: No, no, no, no.ROGINSKY: ...one thing had nothing to do with the other.(LAUGHTER)ROGINSKY: Poor Heidi Cruz...KURTZ: Yes.ROGINSKY: ...poor Heidi Cruz ends up a victim in all of this. And the media has been covering it as a tit for tat as opposed to the fact that Donald Trump was clearly in the wrong and Ted Cruz certainly not a fan of his had nothing to do with this other than defending his wife as any husband should.KURTZ: Right. Although, I think it's fair to say Cruz has seized on this to express his outrage, OK.(Crosstalk)KURTZ: Now, after that Trump tweet, Megyn Kelly of Fox tweeted, seriously, taking a shot at Donald Trump who has taken plenty of shots at her some though is unfair. But, Ashley the reporter story now, there's one in your paper, The New York Times Democratic strategy now is to portray Trump as an unabashed sexist. Washington Post, Trump's critics see the attack as the latest in a troubling pattern of reducing moment to the physical appearances and disparaging them in exceptionally personal ways and then Trump in his twitter response said the press is going out of its way to convince people I don't like or respect women when just the opposite is true.PARKER: Well, I think when the media covers this and reports on what Donald Trump is doing, it's sort of exactly. It gets to a pattern, right and a pattern of character.And as you said, when Donald Trump retweeted that tweet, you could argue (INAUDIBLE) it's him not just justifying Heidi Cruz and being unfair to her but also objectifying his wife.And so is the media sort of reports on what's going on with Donald Trump and Megyn Kelly, what Donald Trump said about Carly Fiorina, what Donald Trump is now saying about Heidi Cruz and even his wife, then voters can sort of draw their conclusions and this is a pattern of behavior?And typically when voters see a pattern, that's when it kind of sticks in the ether and makes an impression.KURTZ: Right, of course Trump is now taking the position that is the press that is creating or embellishing this pattern.Let me turn to this other matter now. We were not planning to touch this story about Ted Cruz and the ""National Enquirer"" not because the Enquirer hasn't done some good reporting in the past along with some high-profile areas but because this particular story right here offers no concrete evidence of Cruz supposedly allegedly having multiple affairs. But that's the key start to get media attention, the senator was quick to denounce it.CRUZ: Let me be clear, this National Enquirer story is garbage. It is complete and utter lies. It is a tabloid smear. And it is a smear that has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen.KURTZ: Now, we have the opposite problem. There is no evidence that Trump or his campaign was behind this story. Trump says in a statement he has no idea whether the piece is true, did not know about it, had absolutely nothing to do with it.So, Gayle, the dilemma for the press here is whether to run with these unproven allegations that use words like rumors, quoting snitches, saying things like supposedly.TROTTER: They shouldn't run with it. Because the story itself shows that the ""National Enquirer"" has a complete lack of evidence. Under the law, a public figure has to have a much higher standard to prove defamation. And that's why if you look at the article itself, it conceals the identity of the five women in this story. And so for the press to run with this, it shows that they are taking something that is not sourced, that does not have evidence and trying to insert it in the presidential campaign.KURTZ: I think many news organizations, not all, were trying to ignore it. But then as we just played, Senator Cruz added the meeting with reporters not in response to a specific question Ashley brought it up, so how is it that or should that change the equation?PARKER: I mean I think it makes it more complicated certainly. Because I think that, you know, these rumors have been around for awhile in Washington and a lot of media organization did nothing with them, didn't even try to report them out. They appear in the Enquirer and I think the morning begins (ph) and everyone is kind of thinking we're going to steer clear of this muck. You know, it's unproven. There's no names, there's you know, no name sources.KURTZ: So, The New York Times is not planning to follow up...PARKER: I...KURTZ: ...as far as you know?PARKER: ...I don't think it was something we were...KURTZ: Yes.PARKER: ...going to report on, no. But then when Senator Ted Cruz comes out and he brings it out unprompted, we do report on what the candidates say and he's now using it to attack Donald Trump. And again, that sale his character, so then it sort of becomes injected in the discussion.Right, this is the flip side of what you were all saying in taking issue with Trump blaming Ted Cruz for the independent pacts picture. And this morning on ABC, Trump said he thinks that Cruz's campaign may have bought the rights to the picture and given it to this small pact. I don't see any evidence of that. But Cruz is making a very serious dirty tricks charge here against -- by blaming it on Trump that it seems to me that he doesn't have any evidence to back up.ROGINSKY: He doesn't. And I'm not, Gayle is the lawyer here, but to me defamation goes both ways, right? He can potentially be defaming Donald Trump by saying that Donald Trump have planted the story but he has no evidence that he plant it although we also suspect that he probably did.KURTZ: Wait, you all suspect? That's not good enough as a journalist standard.ROGINSKY: Exactly right. Exactly right.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.ROGINSKY: But look at what Donald Trump has done so brilliantly to the press and this is a great example this weekend. He did a very detailed story with Maggie Heberman and David Sanger of The New York Times where he talked about his vision for the country if he were president.KURTZ: For over an hour and a half...ROGINSKY: For over an hour and a half...KURTZ: Yes.ROGINSKY: ...full of detail that frankly we're head spinning to a lot of us. Nobody is really focused on that instead, what we're spending time talking about is talking about whether Ted Cruz may have had affairs with one to five women, whether this is a Hulk Hogan situation where somehow Melania Trump's picture got bought by him despite the fact that it's obviously in the public domain because it belongs to GQ or whoever it belongs to which she does work.KURTZ: Yes.ROGINSKY: And so this is why he is so brilliant at playing the press. We're not talking about substance. We're talking about what he do as president. We're talking about essentially what Hulk Hogan was talking about in his Gawker trials, incredible things.KURTZ: You know what, by the way, the Enquirer denies being influenced by anybody under the -- in its reporters and editors in pursuing the story and you know, it is true that Trump is friendly with the CEO of the Enquirer's parent company, David Pecker and it is also true that Roger Stone who had been a kind of unofficial adviser to Trump is not anymore is the only person quoted, on-the-record, as Cruz point it out in this piece just saying while these rumors have been out there.Well, that's not good enough I think for journalistic standards. You know, I've done a lot of reporting on the Enquirer over the years. Enquirer was right in the O.J. Simpson case and John Edwards having a love child and Tiger Woods' multiple mistresses sometimes it run a rumors hitting up story a way of getting sources to come out of the wood work.It doesn't have the story nailed down but it hopes to get to a more definitive story. We'll come back to that but I want to play a moment -- now, this is before most of those organizations were acknowledging the Enquirer story where it was exploding on tweeter and online.This is the moment with CNN and then with two guests, one was Adriana Cohen, who is a Boston Herald columnist who happens to support Donald Trump and the other guest was Amanda Carpenter who is a CNN Contributor who had worked until fairly recently for Ted Cruz. Look at what happened.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ADRIANA COHEN, BOSTON HERALD COLUMNIST: I would like Ted Cruz to issue a statement whether or not the ""National Enquirer"" story is true that he has had affairs with many women including you were named, Amanda. Will you denounce the story or will you confirm it?(LAUGHTER)KATE BOLDUAN, CNN HOST: Let's me just be very clear. It will come as no surprise for our viewers, CNN has no reporting on what you're talking about coming from the ""National Enquirer"", Amanda, go ahead.AMANDA CARPENTER, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: What's out there is tabloid trash. If someone wants to comment on it, they can talk to my lawyer. It is categorically false. You should be ashamed for spreading this kind of smut.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Yes.TROTTER: I'm just speechless thinking about CNN and Bolduan, the anchor allowing her to go on national television on a station like CNN and republish that defamation. I mean this is really shocking that she didn't cut off the discussion right away.KURTZ: Yes. It's hard to react in a moment unsympathetic but Kate Bolduan should not have let it go on I mean then she had to give Amanda Carpenter...TROTTER: Yes.KURTZ: ...a chance to respond...TROTTER: Absolutely.KURTZ: ...and she did very forcefully. But it kind of made me cringe that this, you know, unsubstantiated allegation was then repeated to the face of a woman who is a CNN Contributor who happened to formally work for the Senator.ROGINSKY: Yes, we're setting a precedent where somebody concern and somebody else in television and say when did you start beating your wife,  you have to respond to this kind of allegation I mean inexcusable. I don't -- I have a lot of sympathy for Kate Bolduan.KURTZ: Yes.ROGINSKY: I'm sure she didn't mean for this to happen...KURTZ: And she didn't know it was coming.ROGINSKY: ...and she cut it off.KURTZ: Yes.ROGINSKY: Adriana Cohen frankly owes this woman a humungous apology. But this is where we've gotten to in the cycle. This is what we're talking about. We're talking about -- accusing women of having affairs with each other is the same.KURTZ: I can't argue with that. All right, let me get a break here. Ahead, Fox's interview with Hulk Hogan on his $140 million verdict against Gawker and that sex tape case but when we come back the bombings in Brussels and how they've changed the coverage of the 2016 campaign.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Hours after the terror attacks in Brussels, Donald Trump accepted an invitation that call on to ""The Today Show,"" Hillary Clinton declined but then change her mind after the Trump interview and that kicked off a fierce debate among the pundits and the candidates.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID MUIR, HOST, ""ABC WORLD NEWS TONIGHT"": But it was what Donald Trump said about water boarding and else he would that had Hillary Clinton responding and quickly.HALLIE JACKSON, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: For Hillary Clinton, a chance to prove her national security credentials. For Donald Trump, an opportunity to see more presidential one day after calling for controversial cuts to NATO...ERIN BURNETT, HOST, CNN'S ""OUTFRONT"": Presidential Candidate, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz both pushing controversial plans to fight ISIS. Hillary Clinton says they're guilty of being bigots.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Gayle Trotter, have the Belgian bombings, what a tragedy, push the media and the candidates into a more serious debate about terrorism?TROTTER: I would hope that that would be the case, but I don't think so. I think any time you have a terrorist attack in the west, we have wall-to- wall, 24/7 coverage of the attack because audiences want to know the details. They want to know what happened.But as soon as that -- the details are released, the coverage dies down and then the press can't really come forward with any information that the public wants. Like they want to know how do we defeat the bad guys.And do you -- does the press have any credible information about imminent threats? And the media doesn't come up with that, so then we don't get into the bigger debate about how do we handle this.KURTZ: Well, at least until we all got diverted into the stuff we were talking about in the first segment, this was the dominant story for reporters covering the campaign, was it not?PARKER: Yes, it was and I think -- not only that something we covered in terms of the event itself but also in terms of what the candidates were saying about it. But I think it also changed the lens through which we viewed what they were saying about it.So, for instance, before the attacks, Donald Trump have unveiled five foreign policy advisers who are not particularly well-known in the foreign politic community. He made his comments about maybe...TROTTER: Some of them are.PARKER: Some, but getting out of NATO and then those...KURTZ: Or at least adjusting the U.S. rule...PARKER: Yes, yes adjusted. And then those comments are sort of viewed through in different lens after the attacks and that view, you mentioned the very long 100 minutes with ""The New York Times"" on foreign policy, I think, you know, we may have talked about other things but I do think it led our home page, it's on our front page...KURTZ: Right.PARKER: ...I think people are interested in reading that of this man could be commander-in-chief.KURTZ: Are we in a predictable post attack environment now where conservative pundits are slamming Hillary Clinton on terror and the whole pundits have been asking Trump and Cruz?ROGINSKY: We are and it's going to continue this way until this election is over and I fear it's going to continue this way even after the new president has sworn in because the building behind us is so completely...KURTZ: Polarized.ROGINSKY: ...completely polarized to the point...KURTZ: Yes.ROGINSKY: ...where there is nobody -- there's no working with anybody anymore. You know, I remembered being here on 9/11. I don't remember this kind of coverage after 9/11 where people are turning on each other, immediately turning on the president and turning them congress assign and blame. I fear this is the new normal for us not just in the press, not just in politics but really among the public at large.KURTZ: Yes. That was the time when the country did come together.ROGINSKY: Right.KURTZ: All right, so Ashley, do you think the media have overplayed this story -- conservative criticism, let's put up some pictures here that President Obama stayed in Cuba after the Brussels bombing, didn't cut short his trip and went to a baseball game. The optics were not great...PARKER: Yes, he is, you know, but the president got a lot of criticism in Conservative media for this. His response was that, you know, the goal of terrorism is sort of to disrupt our ordinary lives and he was not going to disrupt his life. It didn't seem to me like a huge story but it was certainly something where you had kind of that polarizing commentary...KURTZ: Right.PARKER: ...do you think -- kind of think what Conservatives are going to say versus what Liberals are going to say.KURTZ: And Gayle, going on to Argentina and dancing then tango reluctantly with that woman, you also thought that was -- is that...TROTTER: Unseemly.KURTZ: ...controversy?TROTTER: Yes, definitely. And definitely, the Conservative media covered this and I thought picked up by mainstream media as well. Because certainly those pictures of him with the Argentinian tango dancer were very dramatic contrast to the people bleeding in the streets of Brussels.KURTZ: To me, the misstep was so briefly addressing the Belgian bombings and then going back to prepare the March leaving aside the fact that these are things you do when you visit these other countries. All right, Gayle Trotter, Ashley Parker, Julie Roginsky thanks very much for joining us this Sunday.Up next, more on how the media are covering the Belgian bombing case and whether that story will soon fade and later, Charles Krauthammer on missing Donald Trump's appeal to Republicans and whether it's too late for Conservatives to stop him.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: The awful news from Brussels broke in the early morning hours on Tuesday and the media quickly went to saturation coverage, joining us now from New York, Joe Concha, a columnist for Mediaite.So, Joe, television news had devoted a lot of resources to this story with anchors like Lester Holt, Matt Lauer, Jeff Smith (ph) and others going to Brussels, how long will this focus last?JOE CONCHA, MEDIAITE COLUMNIST: Howie, I think it will last fairly long time. Because what we're seeing here is the media is correctly using the Paris playbook. What does that mean? After Paris, yes, you covered the terror attacks. But there were raids. There were arrests, and there were confrontations during those arrests that led to compelling television and obviously good journalism.So, I think the media has seen what happened in Paris in November and so we're going to keep our resources there for an indefinite period of time because of those reasons and unfortunately maybe another shoe will drop in term of another attack.KURTZ: Right. Well, despite what the diversions that we talked about earlier in the program, Trump and Cruz and their wives and all that, do you feel like this is a moment -- one moment when the media actually turned serious and gave this kind of story, this kind of tragedy the attention that it deserves?CONCHA: Yes, absolutely, Howie because the fear is very real. If you remember what the president said after San Bernardino, he said, I'm not watching enough cable news to understand the fear and anxiety that is out there.And I can tell you, I -- we're out at LaGuardia Airport in New York on Wednesday and if you know that airport, the security line to go through security is about 20 feet from the main entrance way. And all I was doing personally was looking at the entranceway to see if anyone is walking in with a luggage carrier and one black glove on their left hand.The tension was very real, 60 people standing in a soft target a day after an attack in Brussels. The fear is very real and it's a new reality that we live in and unfortunately, Howie it has nothing to do with cable news coverage or fear-monitoring by the media that I can tell you.KURTZ: Oh, yes because that's supposed to be our next question, implicit in President Obama's remarks that were reported is a notion that cable news is whipping people up beyond a say rational response to the fear of terrorist but were not -- there are always interviews not just with the national security experts and the retired generals but with local police and local airport authorities and could this happen in our town? Do you think that has the cumulative effect of making people more scared?CONCHA: I think it does, Howie because you look at the diversity of soft targets that have happened. In Paris, it was at a cafe outside of a soccer stadium at a rock concert hall; San Bernardino, at an office Christmas party; and then in Brussels, before the security's checkpoint at an airport and in a subway.Think of it. If you're just a regular person, in New York or even a suburb like San Bernardino ISIS is showing it could attack anywhere any time...KURTZ: So...CONCHA: ...so, it's not cable news saying this is a problem. This is a problem -- it's reality.KURTZ: Right. So, you feel it reflects the actual legitimate concerns of people that their town, cities, stadium could be next and not just overdramatizing by cable news just briefly?CONCHA: I absolutely believe that, Howie. And we're seeing it and it happens not only in towns obviously San Bernardino and Brussels and Paris but even there were two attacks in Turkey this month that barely anybody is talking about. That's a NATO member. One happened in Istanbul which is a major American tourist attraction, 34 people killed by ISIS by a suicide bomber, barely any coverage of that. So what was happening strictly over there...KURTZ: Yes.CONCHA: ...being Baghdad or Damascus, this is now happening everywhere, I'm afraid from what we're seeing it's going to continue to happen for a long time.KURTZ: All right, Joe Concha thanks very much for joining us this morning.CONCHA: Thank you, Howie.KURTZ: Coming up, Charles Krauthammer on why his war of words with Donald Trump turned so personal on both sides. Later, could the huge verdict against Gawker undermined press freedom, Fox's Diana Falzone who just interviewed Hulk Hogan.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Does the stop Trump movement have any chance of derailing the Donald and will his detractors in the media have much impact? I sat down with Charles Krauthammer, the syndicated columnist author and Fox News contributor here in studio one.Charles Krauthammer, welcome.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Pleasure to be here.KURTZ: Is it fair to say that for many months you misjudged Donald Trump's appeal to Republicans?KRAUTHAMMER: Yes.KURTZ: Why?KRAUTHAMMER: Well, because I found his appeal so unappealing...(LAUGHTER)KRAUTHAMMER: ...that I found it unfathomable that he would go under such a large constituency. I still remain mildly amazed by the phenomenon, but I no longer deny it.KURTZ: Mildly amazed, not shocked and out of denial which is a good sign. I mean last August in the candidate casino a special report you had more money on Bush and Rubio. You put your first bets on Trump and Cruz.Now, you've got $80 for Trump, $10 for Cruz. Interesting, when I interviewed Trump a couple of weeks ago in Palm Beach, he brought you up as he so often does when he talks about Fox News and he says you never have anything nice to say about him.And he also said that some of the commentators he didn't necessarily say you, he feels have a kind of personal hatred for him.KRAUTHAMMER: I think he feels that about just about everybody. If you ask him to evaluate anyone, remember at the end of the Maureen Dowd column. I think he was asked how do you feel about X, Y, Z, she went through all. And if you look at that, some of them are athletes or whatever. His answer is yes, so and so he likes me. Good guy. So and so. Oh, good friend. Good guy.Everything is in relation to how they feel about him. So I'm sure he feels that -- I have -- I have absolutely no animus against him as a person. I have no reason to. Had he not become a presidential candidate, I mean I don't talk about him otherwise...KURTZ: Sure.KRAUTHAMMER: ...I just think he's animus debt and well obviously he's a good candidate and maybe he will win although I'd be surprised. I think he'd be very bad for the country...(CROSSTALK)KRAUTHAMMER: ...that's the only criteria by which I judge him.KURTZ: For example, when he gave the speech to APAC, a balance support for Israel, you said, well, he's just uttering a necessary cliches. Does that not give you any -- you sound like you weren't giving him the benefit of the doubt politicians out of cliches all the time.KRAUTHAMMER: Right. But I mean I would have said that about any of the other speeches. I didn't find any of them creative. It's clear that he doesn't know the Middle East very well.I actually believe that when he said I'd be neutral, neutrality, that was not an intentional codeword. You know, the language of the Middle East is a host of code words. Even handedness, neutrality has a certain meaning.So, of course, it was interpreted as anti-Israel which is what it means in the lexicon. I am sure that that was not his intent...KURTZ: Right.KRAUTHAMMER: ...he meant it as a layman. So, here's a guy that doesn't know the language. He is not fluent in the issues, didn't know Hamas from Hezbollah a few months ago clearly was reading speech read for him.Now, you know, if you have a Ted Cruz speaking or Hillary Clinton who -- especially Hillary Clinton who has been immersed in these issues, I would have a different reaction. I thought he did very well with the speech.KURTZ: Is the core of your opposition to Trump as opposed to say Ted Cruz who is a -- an aggressive Conservative, is the core of your opposition to Trump that you feel he's not really a Conservative?KRAUTHAMMER: If it were only that, I think it would -- my opposition would be a lot less than it is. There are other candidates who are not that Conservative, take Rand Paul, he's a Libertarian, Conservative in some ways.And, you know, he was not somebody I would have supported. But I hardly argued against his candidacy the way I have against Trump. It's also the matter of temperament which I don't have to spell out.It is written all over him. It's written all over the stuff he's done with Cruz, Megyn Kelly with a whole list of things. And that kind of temperament I think is so inappropriate for a president.KURTZ: And you don't have criticism approve -- you don't have criticism approve?(CROSSTALK)KRAUTHAMMER: ...in and of itself -- well, not in the sense that I see it in Trump. Cruz may not be the most likeable guy. But you don't elect somebody simply because you have a beer with him...KURTZ: Let me ask you this because I want to get to another question. Here's...KRAUTHAMMER: But the question is do you have judgment, does he have the wisdom, does he have the self-restraint to be in the oval office?KURTZ: Here's the mainstream media tape right now. The Republican Party can either go along with Trump's nomination which would rupture the party or denying him the nomination at a contested convention which would rupture the party. Which is true -- are they both true?KRAUTHAMMER: They could both be true, but I think it depends how they go into the convention. If Trump, is you know, a three foot putt away from the majority, say 100 seats, 50 seats, then I think there's a sense in which he deserved it or he got near to it. Technically not, I guess he could be stopped, but I think you could then justify the argument, it was smite. But if he's simply ahead of Cruz...KURTZ: He's on the 16th hole of the golf course.KRAUTHAMMER: Yes, on the 16th hole...KURTZ: Yes.KRAUTHAMMER: ...your head by two. It's not a gimme at that point. Then we all know famously Lincoln was not leading in the delegate when he was nominated for the presidency in 1860.KURTZ: Last question, which will have a bigger impact on the campaign the bombings in Brussels and all of the terror issues that it raises or the spot going on between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump about their wives and now this National Enquirer story about Cruz and some of the more tabloid stuff?KRAUTHAMMER: I would divide the answer in two. In the Primary's, I think it has been, will be terrorism. The Trump campaign took off like a rocket after the Paris attacks. It seemed to retroactively justify some of the scandalous stuff he said and the stuff that came after which is the barring of Muslims as...(CROSSTALK)KRAUTHAMMER: ...in general election, I think the wife stuff, the gutter stuff, the crazy stuff that's going to carry over. It's not going to affect Primary because people have -- they know who Trump is that they've been exposed to him now very heavily. But I think when you get in the general election when the Democrats are going to unload awful (ph) research, it will be a different story.KURTZ: Charles Krauthammer thanks very much for joining us.KRAUTHAMMER: My pleasure.KURTZ: And on ""MediaBuzz,"" the latest on Apple versus the FBI. Is the company now getting sympathetic coverage refusing to help the feds in a terror case?But, first, how does a guy who kept talking about a sex tape with his best friend's wife win $140 million against Gawkers? Diana Falzone on her sits down with Hulk Hogan.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: The jury in the Hulk Hogan sex tape case with Gawker won another $25 million impunity damages this week, this is after a verdict that imposed a $115 million penalty in the former wrestler's lawsuit. Gawker founder, Nick Denton, said his appeal will focus on key evidence that was excluded by the judge and still defends his decision to post the video.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you feel any remorse about posting that sex tape now?NICK DENTON, GAWKER FOUNDER: No. You know what, I don't. We didn't post the sex tape. We posted nine seconds of sexual activity in an excerpt sort of much, much longer tape.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Hogan talked about the personal impact with Fox's, Diana Falzone.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DIANA FALZONE, FOX NEWS.COM REPORTER: The judge and Gawker tried numerous times to get you to settle on arbitration behind closed doors. Why did you want this to go to trial?HOGAN: It still makes me cower. You know when I leave my house and I meet people what do they think? Did they see the tape? What do the kids think? So, really it wasn't about. It was about this not ever happened to anybody else because I know how it affected me and so all I wanted was to let everyone know what Gawker is all about and what they do to destroy lives.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Joining us now from New York, here is Diana Falzone, entertainment reporter for FoxNews.com who has covered this case from the beginning. And Diana, Hulk Hogan who are talked about this sex tape with Howard Stern and others says he was fighting against invasion of privacy. He also got a lot of zillion dollars, so do you find that he was doing this in the name of cleaning up journalism?FALZONE: I wasn't doing -- he wasn't doing it in the name of cleaning up journalism. I think he was doing it in the name of cleaning up his reputation. This was a man who could have settled behind closed doors.In fact, Gawker and the judge was insisting on that for about 3-1/2 years but him and his lawyer said, no, we are going to vindicate Hulk Hogan's reputation.So this was more about him and then in the long run it was about defending people's privacy. He was saying he was Terry Bollea which is his real name not Hulk Hogan in those private moments...KURTZ: Right.FALZONE: ...with Bubba the Love Sponge's then wife.KURTZ: It is then wife, yes. OK, so the excluded evidence that Gawker says could have turned the tide here involved allegation that's Hogan's real motivation in filing this suit was to make sure that another tape didn't come out in which he had made racist comments. Here's what he said to you in your interview this week.HOGAN: On top of, you know, the horrible decision I made morally at an all time low with the low mid-story (ph) that goes with it...FALZONE: Right.HOGAN: ...you know, if I could make people understand, you know, that that one moment doesn't define me. Also, all those people that really don't know me I'm not a racist.KURTZ: Your thoughts on that exchange?FALZONE: This man, when he came and sat down with me, he had bloodshot eyed. He looked like he was just going through the greatest match of his life. It's hard to know somebody's heart when it comes to racism and what their intent is. You can't really judge that but I will say this and this is very interesting.The Hulk Hogan camp, his lawyers were able to exclude that racist rant from the trial. So that what makes sense (ph) talking about when they say key evidence was left out. But Hulk Hogan's legal camp did not want the jury to be poisoned by hearing that rant.KURTZ: All right, now these massive awards are often knocked down on appeal but a lot of people are seeing this as a kind of co-muffins (ph) against Gawker which is we cast himself (ph) more recently is a political side, but which over the years has published a lot of mean spirit stuff about a lot of people's private lives.FALZONE: Yes, they have.KURTZ: So do you think some people were rooting for Hulk not because he's such a sympathetic figure, a guy sleeping with his best friend's wife, but because he was taken on Gawker?FALZONE: I think that definitely has something to do with but the jury said that Gawker was very arrogant and remember Nick Denton has been unapologetic so is AJ Daulerio, one of the former Gawker editor, they like to cloak kind of -- kind of making this OK by using the freedom of speech. But when is the line drawn? There is a code of ethics in journalism and they really like to walk that line very closely.KURTZ: I think this will have something of a chilling effect on the rest of the press, not worried that we're all in the business of posting sex tapes with what you are reporting on a celebrity online gossip in particular and you think the person might sue and you might get a jury that will award a big verdict, I think it could act as a deterrent. What do you think?FALZONE: Considering that Gawker is unapologetic, there will always be sites that have questionable moral integrity. As long as there is social media and Smartphone, I think we will see more cases like Hulk Hogan in the future. But perhaps some of them will think before they go in and type something up but unfortunately I don't see much changing.KURTZ: Well, we'll see about that. I do think it will a bit of a deterrent and perhaps that's needed. Diana Falzone, great to see you. Thanks for coming by.FALZONE: Thank you, Howard.KURTZ: After the break, a glowing time cover story on Apple, CEO Tim Cook for defying the FBI on hacking a terrorist iPhone which have now turns out may not be necessary.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: You've seen the negative headlines. The FBI has been painting Apple executives as the bad guys for refusing to create a technology that could unlock the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino terrorists.But this week the Justice Department did an about-face saying an unnamed third party providing information that could allow the feds to hack into the phone without Apple's help.Joining us now, Shana Glenzer, a technology executive and commentator here in Washington. So, Apple is starting to get better press in this battle why is that -- how is Apple doing it?SHANA GLENZER, TECHNOLOGY EXECUTIVE AND COMMENTATOR: Yes, I think out of this legal battle, Apple made some statements on its website but since then they have embarked on a media campaign that's really unprecedented in Apple's history...KURTZ: Apple is usually so secretive and doesn't really talk to journalists very much.GLENZER: They are very quiet. They just about their product and it's usually not their CEO talking about it. So, they have scored points with these multiple interviews and Tim Cook. Meanwhile, we saw the FBI backtracking their statement with the, you know, the delay in the hearing because the third party came forward about a potential solution. So, in this week, you know, Apple is certainly winning the media battle about this issue.KURTZ: Well, as Wired Magazine pointed it out, Apple has been doing conference calls with journalists, providing backgrounds, inviting some reporters to the Washington Office and doing interview with ABC, David Muir and then there was this Time Magazine cover story on Tim Cook, lot of quotes from the Apple CEO on this including such things as when I think of civil liberties I think of the founding principles of this country. How sympathetic is this story Tim Cook and Apple?GLENZER: They gave -- they gave Tim Cook a lot of room in the story to make his case and, you know, in one side I can see why this unprecedented access made a reporter very happy just to tell the story in way it has not been told before. Yet the public (ph) wanted to keep access to him in the future for future story but, you know, they -- he -- and the reporter did show some biased. He used language that Tim Cook said up. For example go to the west (ph) to describe the hack that the government requesting...KURTZ: Government Operating System.GLENZER: ...Government Operating System, so they started using his language throughout the course of the rest of the story and I felt that it was a bit biased.KURTZ: Right. Well, you get a time cover story a lot of this is framing  the issue in your direction. I have seen a turn in the tone of the coverage, ""New York Times"" reporting that hackers would go to the government with word of being able to unlock an IPhone but would not go to Apple, why is that?GLENZER: So, Apple has historically not done very much at anything to reward hackers for coming forward with the security flaws whereas other companies like Google or Microsoft -- Google pays $100,000 to hackers to reward them for finding these flaws. And Apple has just been very stubborn, they've dug their heels then and now they are going in the open market versus coming to Apple.KURTZ: But isn't -- isn't that buying off the hackers, paying them off, is there anything unsafely about this?GLENZER: I mean I think that it does feel unsavory. But they are getting -- what they want is monetary reward for what they're finding and it's what they do for a living and Apple is not giving it to them. They're going to open market where they're getting up to a million dollar for the security flaws they find from Apple.KURTZ: Apple had a very tough situation here because it was really being portrayed not just as uncooperative with the federal investigation but unpatriotic, so it was a challenge to turn this around.GLENZER: It was challenging but the way that they've engaged and also it helps the backtracking from the FBI, they have come out on top of certainly at least this week in this battle over privacy and security.KURTZ: And you would say this lead to the FBI not so much in terms of its media portrayal?GLENZER: Yes, the FBI...KURTZ: ...it said that the only way they could do this with the terrorist's phone was to get help from Apple and now?GLENZER: And now they got tracked because oh, there might -- wait, there might be another solution and they could be criticized across the media broadly for doing that.KURTZ: All right, Shana Glenzer thanks very much for helping us follow this story...GLENZER: Yes, thank you.KURTZ: Still to come, a list of all the people and places that Donald Trump loves with one rather surprising name.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I love the Hispanics. I love the Saudis. I love Israel. I love the Evangelicals. I love the Mormons.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KURTZ: Hey, now I want to say a few words about the passing of Garry Shandling, who put on the best satirical condition of a TV talk show in civilized history. The Larry Sanders Show featured an ego-centric insecure, thin skinned, oversexed, late night host who scored with his guest with lots of cameos by various A-listers. It was kind of a hall of nervous (ph) for the fake sincerity and nagging the row seats (ph) of Hollywood.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GARRY SHANDLING, AMERICAN COMEDIAN: That was the time that (ph) I'm sweating like a pig.ROBIN WILLIAMS, ACTOR: How am I really doing?SHANDLING: You did great, man. Why do you think that? Come on, you're Robin Williams, for God's sake's...(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: This was a ground breaking show back in the '90s and many comedians now paying tribute to Garry Shandling's influence on their careers.Well, I've noticed that most of this Donald Trump events that the billionaire is always proclaiming his love for this or that group, or this of that set of people, or this of that state or country well, Jimmy Kimmel is on the case and the ABC Comedian rounded up a few examples.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST, ""JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE"": He spread so much love. We boiled it down and pieced it to together to make this powerful Donald Trump love bomb.TRUMP: I love this country. I love the country. I love the old days. I love free trade. I love my company. I love building buildings. I love what I'm doing. I love hopping around. I love the way they twist and turn. I love NASCAR. I love you potatoes. We love people that fend (ph). I love that sign. I love to bring my people up. I love helping people. I love Howie Kurtz.(END VIDEO CLIP)KURTZ: Wait. What am I doing in there? Oh, right, it was when he called on me at the Trump tower news conference a few months back and Trump generally thinks I've been fair to him. But believe me he tells me when he doesn't think I'm fair. When I showed up in a press this week, this new Pennsylvania avenue hotel, where we gave reporters a brief toy that was so crowded and chaotic, it's a shock no one was hurt, I was waving my hand and I could not get a question and politics alas, love can be so fleeting. Shana?GLENZER: It turns out -- I guess politicians are a little fickle when it comes to their loving of journalists.KURTZ: Kind of like women can be a little fickle.(LAUGHTER)GLENZER: I'm not going to touch that one.KURTZ: You're not going to touch that one, yes. The bromances and the romances in politics and media rarely last.Well, Happy Easter to you, and Happy Easter to all of you. That's it for this edition of ""MediaBuzz,"" I am a Howard Kurtz.
